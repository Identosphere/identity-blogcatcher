   More than an OpenAI Wrapper: Perplexity Pivots to Open Source 
 I'm increasingly impressed with Perplexity.ai - I'm using it on a daily basis now. It's by far the best implementation I've seen of LLM-assisted search - beating Microsoft Bing and Google Bard at their own game.

<p>A year ago it was implemented as a GPT 3.5 powered wrapper around Microsoft Bing. To my surprise they've now evolved way beyond that: Perplexity has their own search index now and is running their own crawlers, and they're using variants of Mistral 7B and Llama 70B as their models rather than continuing to depend on OpenAI.</p>

<p>Getting immersed in a new subject is a great experience. ISO SC 37 wrapped up a week-long series of meetings yesterday in Okayama Japan. Here are some things I learned along the way:</p>



<p>SC 37 is smaller than the other ISO committees I’m in – about 60 in-person plus about 20 online this week across 6 work groups. It makes for a tight-knit group and provides lots of time to build relationships. It also means that the workload is sane – on other committees I have to ignore all but the 2 or 3 projects I’m directly involved in.</p>



<p>The main work of the committee is extensible data exchange formats, APIs, evaluation of biometric technologies, performance testing and societal aspects. </p>



<p>SC 37 was started in the early 2000s to meet the needs of ICAO to add biometric information to passports – face, finger and iris formats were the first. Since then, work has been done to cover other biometric modalities such as voice, skeletal structure, vein pattern and others. </p>



<p>Participants are primarily from Government border control, immigration, public safety, law enforcement departments. I’m one of a very small number focused on consumer-provided sensors and devices for use in commercial scenarios. </p>



<p>Biometrics is all about statistical analysis – I never really thought much about it – using the lazy term “probabilistic” – but it really is about estimation and weighting of data samples. So I might have to break open a textbook or two to relearn by sum-overs, means, medians, and standard deviations – not looking forward that that part!</p>



<p>“Convoluted Neural Networks” appear to be broadly used to look for patterns and help to draw conclusions. Another area I must learn about quickly.</p>



<p>There is a significant desire to apply biometric binding of people to data records – for example during ID Proofing and Verification. But it was clear that SC 37 is not the best place to do that work. SC 17 for mDoc credentials or SC 27/WG 5 for identity management seem better suited for this work.</p>



<p>I realized by the end of the week that being an “identity management” guy in the “biometrics” world is a very good thing – the latter can be applied to operations of the former and I get to work on both sides.</p>



<p>So I’m looking forward to working with the committee members and digging deep into the material. Hopefully I can bring useful opinions from the consumer world to drive discussions and improve the body of work.</p>

 This is a really interesting new twist on Python notebooks. 

 The most powerful feature is that these notebooks are reactive: if you change the value or code in a cell (or change the value in an input widget) every other cell that depends on that value will update automatically. It's the same pattern implemented by Observable JavaScript notebooks, but now it works for Python.

<p>There are a bunch of other nice touches too. The notebook file format is a regular Python file, and those files can be run as "applications" in addition to being edited in the notebook interface. The interface is very nicely built, especially for such a young project - they even have GitHub Copilot integration for their CodeMirror cell editors.</p>

<p>Next Ben combined that with active users from the /nodeinfo/2.0 API on each instance to figure out the number of users on each of those major hosting providers.</p>

<p>Cloudflare and Fastly were heavily represented, but it turns out you can unveil the underlying IP for most instances by triggering an HTTP Signature exchange with them and logging the result.</p>

<p>Ben's conclusion: Hertzner and OVH are responsible for hosting a sizable portion of the fediverse as it exists today.</p>

   I’ve spent much of my career telling organizations that they should publish in a space that they control, on their own domain name.  My usual argument is that it shields you from major changes in company policy, or even from the platform you’re depending on from going out of business.

<p></p><p>I’ve spent much of my career telling organizations that they should publish in a space that they control, on their own domain name.</p><p>My usual argument is that it shields you from major changes in company policy, or even from the platform you’re depending on from going out of business. If you’ve built a media business on a platform knowing that it’s been designed as a place for text-heavy media businesses, but one day it decides it’s going to be more profitable if it becomes a place for 3D immersive video, and your whole audience is locked into that platform, your media business is in trouble.</p><p>Publishing on your own site and your own domain name avoids that issue: you have full control over your underlying platform, and because you can change where your domain name points to, you can change your platform without losing any of your audience. In terms of <a href="https://www.isc.hbs.edu/strategy/business-strategy/Pages/the-five-forces.aspx">Michael Porter’s Five Forces</a>, this tactic reduces the power of suppliers — the platform that underpins your site — to dictate the terms of your business.</p><p>The trouble is, running your own site isn’t easy. If you’re a developer, you probably have the skills and knowledge to select an underlying platform, install it on a server, secure your infrastructure, customize it, and optimize it for discovery and sharing. If you’re a writer, you might not — and even if you are a developer, if you’re trying to start a site from scratch, all that technical administration is time taken away from working on all the stuff that makes your site special. Having a well-running platform for your site is table stakes; the core value of any site is the content itself. As any entrepreneur knows, you should spend as much time as possible on your core value: focusing on the thing that makes you unique and special will give you a better chance of success.</p><p>All of this doesn’t mean that the characteristics of a platform aren’t important. They’re very important, and can make or break a media startup, which is why Substack seemed like such a good choice for a great many people. It had everything: integrated payments, a solid recommendation engine that accelerated subscriber growth, support for using your own domain name, customized branding, optimizations for search engines and social sharing, and it just felt really good to use.</p><p>On a technical level, Substack was clearly a very good choice for independent writers trying to make a living on their own. It also stood in contrast to Medium, which had similar goals but was firmly optimized around helping people earn a living from individual articles even if they didn’t have a built-in audience (I’ll say more about Medium in a minute). Both were free to get started on, relieving writers from the technical or financial burden of setting up their own platform, but each had a different focus. On Medium, great pieces stood alone, so you could gain an audience for a thought even if you didn’t have a following; on Substack, you could build a following for your ongoing work.</p><p>Which is why it was incredibly disappointing when it became clear that the platform actively embraced and funded bigots. First came the transphobes, which a few people made a fuss about, but not enough. (If we rewrote <a href="https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/martin-niemoeller-first-they-came-for-the-socialists">Martin Niemöller’s famous poem</a> for today, trans people would be the first line.) Then, most recently, it became clear that Substack was rife with actual flag-waving Nazis.</p><p><a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/why-platformer-is-leaving-substack">As Casey Newton pointed out in Platformer</a>:</p><blockquote><p>To be clear, there are a lot more than six bad publications on Substack: our analysis found dozens of far-right publications advocating for the great replacement theory and other violent ideologies. […] The company’s edgelord branding ensures that the fringes will continue to arrive and set up shop, and its infrastructure creates the possibility that those publications will grow quickly. That’s what matters.</p></blockquote><p>That’s what made it untenable for me and a great many other publishers. Platformer, Garbage Day, Citation Needed, and ParentData are some of the titles that have moved away (or announced that they’re moving away) over the last week, and these are the high-profile tip of a much larger iceberg.</p><p>So where should writers go?</p><p>Unfortunately, I think a platform that’s completely right as an alternative to Substack doesn’t exist, which I’ll talk about in a moment. Where writers have been going fall into a few buckets:</p>  <a href="https://buttondown.email">Buttondown</a>, an independent newsletter platform 
 <a href="https://ghost.org">Ghost</a>, a blogging platform with built-in support for newsletters and paid subscriptions (sometimes through Ryan Singel’s excellent <a href="https://outpost.pub/">Outpost</a> service) 
 <a href="https://wordpress.org">WordPress</a>, the blogging platform that powers roughly a third of the web (but has poor support for newsletters and paid subscriptions) 
 Biting the bullet and developing or self-hosting their own thing 
 <p>My approach, because I’ve always had my own site running on <a href="https://withknown.com">Known</a>, has been to move my newsletter to Buttondown. It’s worked really well for me, but these are all good approaches.</p><p>I’ve been a bit surprised to not hear about people moving to&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com">Medium</a>, which has been undergoing a quiet transformation under Tony Stubblebine’s leadership over the last year. It’s certainly worth considering: revenue is up, the platform has reorganized itself around publishers and followings, it supports custom domains, writers can take their content and subscribers with them if they choose to leave, and the strategic thrash of the mid-2010s is gone. Tony and his team are genuinely hunkering down and doing the work to support writers.</p><p>A big difference with Medium is that the audience’s financial relationship is with the platform rather than a writer. On Substack, you subscribed to outlets like Platformer and Citation Needed individually; on Medium, <a href="https://medium.com/membership">you’re paying one of two tiers to access the full network</a>. For readers, that’s clearly far better: you’re getting a world of writing for the same flat price. For writers, getting frictionless access to Medium’s aggregate paying userbase may help grow followers; it is clearly true, though, that you can’t bring your paid customer relationships with you if you choose to leave. On Substack, those relationships are made directly with you and depend on you having your own account with <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>, which means you can leave and keep servicing your subscriptions without asking anyone to re-enter their payment details.</p><p>In order to really support independent media startups, particularly individual writers looking to make money from their work on their own, there are three categories of service that I wish existed:</p> A fully-managed direct relationship platform for writers <p>Any writer should be able to sign up to a service, configure their platform, and begin selling their writing directly to an audience without worrying about their writing showing up next to, or appearing to endorse, hate speech. It should be beautiful, easy to use, and friction-free.</p><p>They should be able to own their relationship with their audience to the point where if they choose to change platforms, they can take their audience with them and seamlessly start writing somewhere else. They should never have to deal with technical configuration: everything should just work. And each writer should be able to gain from network effects as the platform grows, allowing them to gain a following and build revenue more quickly.</p><p>That’s almost Medium, aside from the direct relationships. That’s almost Ghost, aside from the network effects. So close!</p> Indie recommendations <p>A lot of the focus of the <a href="https://indieweb.org">indieweb</a> and of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse">fediverse</a> has been to provide an independent alternative to social media. I have no criticism of that approach! We need that! But there’s also something I’d like to see that goes beyond it.</p><p>I think we’ve assumed that social media is how we learn about new websites and articles. That’s a user experience pattern that has been inherited directly from Twitter and Facebook, which always wanted to be the way people discovered news and information. When I built the first version of Known, I had the idea of owning your own versions of social media platforms in mind.</p><p>Long before social networks, personal websites had links to other sites the authors enjoyed. Sometimes it was just called a links page. Blogs called them the blogroll. Substack’s version of this was for an author to recommend other newsletters, so when someone subscribed, they would also be asked if they’d want to subscribe to these other author-endorsed outlets. It was a superb way for writers to rapidly build a following outside of their own established networks.</p><p>The following requires some underlying protocol work, but here’s how it would work from the user side:</p>  As a user, I want to subscribe to an author. 
 I visit their site and click to subscribe, entering my details. 
 The site shows me a selection of other blogs or newsletters the author recommends. 
 I agree to subscribe to those. (Not as a paying subscriber, but as someone who will receive new content as it is published.) 
 I am instantly fully subscribed, without having to enter any further information on those third party sites. 
 The authors of those sites know that they gained new subscribers that were referred from the recommending site. 
 <p>The net result: every author can have the freedom and ownership of publishing on their own site, but with the network effects of a closed network.</p><p>Of course, even without this infrastructure, any site can already create a links page or a blogroll. I’m actively working on that.</p> Self-hosting that works like an iPhone <p>You should be able to pay for server hosting and have access to a fully-managed App Store that, just like an iPhone, lets you install new services with one click and keeps your software up-to-date. Some of those services will be free; some will be paid-for. It should be no more complicated than that, with zero exposure to the underlying server processes and scripts.</p><p>Shared hosting still hasn’t really evolved since the nineties: it’s a world of (S)FTP access, dubious control panels that don’t do much to help the user, and appalling user experiences. Virtual hosting is newer and more powerful, but you need to be a very sophisticated user to deal with containers, package managers, and so on. The former are designed for hobbyists; the latter are designed for software engineering teams. A self-hosting environment that’s optimized for non-technical individuals to own their own websites and data does not exist.</p> In summary <p>We do need a way to support great writing. It’s how we learn about the world, quite often in a way that helps inform our democratic decisions and the way we see the society around us. A world where everyone is writing for free and independent journalism has no means of financial support is not tenable or desirable, in my opinion.</p><p>I also believe that not providing financial support to literal Nazis is non-negotiable. I can’t believe that’s an argument we even have to make. This isn’t ambiguous: Nazis are bad.</p><p>The indie web should be a place where independent writers can thrive. I believe it will be. We just need a little bit more infrastructure: network effects, easy payments, removing the need for non-technical people to get involved in technical administration. The Ghost ecosystem in particular has shown us that there’s a great opportunity for this to be done well for writers.</p><p>Unlike many open source / indie web folks, I also don’t draw a hard line about hosted services like Medium, given the right features. The important thing for me is that writers can write and be heard. Anything that makes that easier — while not, again, literally funding Nazis — is fantastic in my book. The writing is what matters. Letting people connect and learn from each other — reaching people with ideas — is what the web is all about. The trick is giving them the tools and freedom to do that sustainably, on their own terms.</p>

<p>Montag werden sich die Verhandlungsteams im <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/LIBE-AM-757302_EN.pdf">LIBE-Ausschuss des Europäischen Parlaments zum ersten Mal mit Änderungsanträgen </a> beschäftigen. Der Abgeordnete der Piratenpartei Dr. Patrick Breyer, Verhandlungsführer seiner Fraktion im LIBE-Ausschuss, beantragt fundamentale Änderungen des Vorschlags:</p>



<p>„Damit der digitale Euro seinen Namen verdient und einen Sinn und Mehrwert im Vergleich zu Kreditkarten und Kryptowährungen hat, muss digitales Bargeld so anonym und frei nutzbar sein wie Scheine und Münzen – nicht nur bei physischer Anwesenheit beider Seiten. Die Einführung digitalen Bargelds ist in der heutigen Lebensrealität des Informationszeitalters überfällig.</p>



<p>Da man unbegrenzt Bargeld besitzen und weitergeben darf, darf auch die Menge an Digitalen Euro in unserer Hand nicht limitiert werden. Und so wie mit Bargeld auch vertrauliche Zahlungen und kontroverse Spenden anonym und ohne Furcht vor Bekanntwerden möglich sind, dürfen auch spurenlose Zahlungen in digitalem Euro nicht unmöglich gemacht oder auf eine unbekannte und wechselnde Höhe begrenzt werden, wie es die EU-Kommission vorschlägt. Die Begründung Geldwäsche und Terrorismus bekämpfen zu wollen ist nur ein Vorwand, um immer mehr Kontrolle über unsere privaten Geschäfte zu erlangen. Wo jede Zahlung erfasst und für immer gespeichert wird, drohen Hackerangriffe, unberechtigte Ermittlungen und eine abschreckende Staatsaufsicht über jeden Kauf und jede Spende.</p>



<p>Bargeld ist finanzielle Freiheit ohne Rechtfertigungsdruck. Welche Medikamente oder welches Sexspielzeug ich einkaufe, geht niemanden etwas an. Seit Tausenden von Jahren haben Gesellschaften auf der ganzen Welt mit Bargeld, das die Privatsphäre schützt, gelebt. Diese finanzielle Freiheit muss auch im Informationszeitalter garantiert werden. Wir müssen Wege finden, die besten Eigenschaften von Bargeld in unsere digitale Zukunft mitzunehmen.“</p>



<p>Konkret fordert Breyer, dezentrale Offlinezahlungen unmittelbar zwischen Endgeräten nicht nur in physischer Anwesenheit der Zahlenden zuzulassen (Änderungsantrag 76) und sie im Vergleich zu Bargeld keiner Benachteiligung wie durch Höchstgrenzen zu unterwerfen (Änderungsanträge 203-205, 207).</p>

<p>The legal issues Tom discusses here are important: I think a lot of fediverse administrators and service operators tend to hand-wave them away, but they really are big issues. I encountered some of them when I was running Known, too: people were angry their content was showing up on some other service that they hadn't opted into.</p>

<p>Meta does seem to be heading into this endeavor in good faith. There's still a lot to figure out, but I think Threads will be a full, participative fediverse participant. I'm curious to see which other large network operators join them.  <a href="https://werd.io/tag/Technology">#Technology</a></p>

<p>A couple of click throughs in this morning’s review triggered this post.</p>
<p>It started here … <a href="https://tedium.co/2024/01/10/substack-moderation-nazis-minimum/">🔗 Substack Barely Does The Bare Minimum</a></p>
<p>which linked to here … <a href="https://gilest.org/indie-easy.html">🔗 gilest.org: Make the indie web easier</a></p>
<p>which then linked to here … <a href="https://gilest.org/indie-easy-again.html">🔗 gilest.org: More on the easier indie web</a></p>
 TL;DR 
<p>A few links to interesting places that are about the indie web - but with an undercurrent of something that I have been banging on about forEVER …</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If we truly want to open up the web for everyone to publish on, we have to make it easier. Let’s give people choices. Let’s give people options for tools they can set up and use, with no more knowledge than the knowledge they already have.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>💬 Giles Turnbull'</p>
 YES 
<p>There are a few - and indeed MicroBlog is one such example (that is not listed in those links) … although even MicroBlog has its challenges.
I think the overall challenge is two fold; <br>
1] It is not easy. <br>
- so requires significant resources to make it a reality. <br>
2] Does ‘everybody’ care enough? <br>
- because if they don’t - I feel the TAM might be pretty small - and will include a large number of people already in the camp of what we have is good enough.</p>

<p>This study seems to explore the approach of incremental prompting to produce an AI-driven final results.

I like that image too, but I'd like to think of it as more of a party: there are guitars, and people racing boats out on the water, and everybody else chatting and laughing on the shore.

<p>This paper describes a really interesting LLM system that runs Retrieval Augmented Generation against Wikipedia to help answer questions, but includes a second step where facts in the answer are fact-checked against Wikipedia again before returning an answer to the user. They claim "97.3% factual accuracy of its claims in simulated conversation" on a GPT-4 backed version, and also see good results when backed by LLaMA 7B.</p>

<p>The implementation is mainly through prompt engineering, and detailed examples of the prompts they used are included at the end of the paper.</p>

   Python 3.13 gets a JIT

<p>"In late December 2023 (Christmas Day to be precise), CPython core developer Brandt Bucher submitted a little pull-request to the Python 3.13 branch adding a JIT compiler."</p>

<p>Anthony Shaw does a deep dive into this new experimental JIT, explaining how it differs from other JITs. It's an implementation of a copy-and-patch JIT, an idea that only emerged in 2021. This makes it architecturally much simpler than a traditional JIT, allowing it to compile faster and take advantage of existing LLVM tools on different architectures.</p>

<p>So far it's providing a 2-9% performance improvement, but the real impact will be from the many future optimizations it enables.</p>

   With the benefit of hindsight, I did a bad job with my post, It’s OK to call it Artificial Intelligence a few days ago. 
 I constructed the post in a confrontational way, reacting against a strawman argument. This wasn't necessary, and it angered people who justifiably felt I was attacking them.

  <p>With the benefit of hindsight, I did a bad job with my post, <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jan/7/call-it-ai/">It’s OK to call it Artificial Intelligence</a> a few days ago.</p>
<p>I constructed the post in a confrontational way, reacting against a strawman argument. This wasn't necessary, and it angered people who justifiably felt I was attacking them.</p>
<p>Reading it again now, the message I conveyed was not what I intended. People interpreted it as saying that their time spent arguing that AI is not intelligent was unproductive - a reasonable interpretation, given that I said "... I still don’t think this argument is a helpful contribution to the discussion."</p>
<p>That was rude and unfair. I'm sorry. I regret writing and including that. I should have done better, more careful work with this.</p>
<p>Here's a much improved version of what I wanted to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are many good arguments for why the term Artificial Intelligence is problematic. I've been uncomfortable with it myself. Despite those arguments, I've decided to give in to the larger cultural momentum and invest in helping people understand what modern AI can do and how it works, rather than spending any time convincing them to call it something else.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is (and should be) a personal decision! My big error here was implying that other people should do the same thing.</p>
<p>The rest of <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jan/7/call-it-ai/">my original post</a> was meant to justify my decision, focusing mainly on the academic history of the term and the confusion I felt around more accurate but less widely understood terminology like Large Language Models.</p>
<p>I confess that I hit publish on that previous post despite having lingering doubts about how effectively it made its argument. A version of it had sat in my drafts folder since May, and I figured published and flawed is better than staying draft forever.</p>
<p>That attitude has served me well in the past, but that's been for posts with much lower stakes. If I'm describing a project I've built, sloppy writing doesn't really matter. I <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/cloudflare/cloudflare-cache-html">published</a> <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/fly/varnish-on-fly">three</a> <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/datasette/playwright-tests-datasette-plugin">separate</a> TIL posts yesterday and the risk of harm from mistakes in those was trivial.</p>
<p>When I’m writing about something contentious, I need to do better. I'll be bearing this in mind in the future.</p>

Thanks to the paper I now have a reasonable understanding of how a mixture of experts model works: each layer has 8 available blocks, but a router model selects two out of those eight for each token passing through that layer and combines their output. "As a result, each token has access to 47B parameters, but only uses 13B active parameters during inference."</p>

<p>The Mixtral token context size is an impressive 32k, and it compares extremely well against the much larger Llama 70B across a whole array of benchmarks.</p>

<p>Unsurprising but disappointing: there's nothing in the paper at all about what it was trained on.</p>

<p>I don't think it should have that ability. Either it's a neutral utility - which is an impossibility because of its obvious community curation, but also because of rules imposed on it at the payment layer - or it's a platform. It can't be both. And because it can't be the former, the company needs to take real responsibility for its actions, rather than pin itself to this clearly cynical policy dressed up as principles.  <a href="https://werd.io/tag/Media">#Media</a></p>

   Text Embeddings Reveal (Almost) As Much As Text

   I moved my account from @herestomwiththeweather@mastodon.social to @tom@herestomwiththeweather.com on January 2nd.  In the spirit of learning from post-mortems, I am documenting a few mistakes I made.

  <p>I moved my account from <a href="https://mastodon.social/@herestomwiththeweather">@herestomwiththeweather@mastodon.social</a> to <a href="https://otisburg.social/actor/tom@herestomwiththeweather.com">@tom@herestomwiththeweather.com</a> on January 2nd.  In the spirit of learning from <a href="https://github.com/danluu/post-mortems/">post-mortems</a>, I am documenting a few mistakes I made.</p>

<p>One of the main motivations for the move was that <a href="https://github.com/herestomwiththeweather/herestomwiththeweather.github.io/commit/16a5882581d2bfb044a6537a629033698adc80a7">over a year ago</a>, I had configured webfinger on this site to point to the account I had on <a href="https://mastodon.social/">mastodon.social</a>. But once someone has found me on mastodon, I would from then on be known by my mastodon identifier rather than the identifier with my personal domain.  If I lost access to that particular mastodon account for whatever reason, I would be unreachable by that mastodon identifier.  However, as I described in <a href="https://herestomwiththeweather.com/2023/09/22/webfinger-expectations/">Webfinger Expectations</a>, if my webfinger configuration points me to a server that will allow me to participate on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse">fediverse</a> with my own personal identifier using my own domain, then in theory, if I lose access to the account on that server, I can swap it out with another similar server and be reachable again with my personal identifier.  So, last week <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/moving/">I moved</a> to <a href="https://otisburg.social">Otisburg.social</a> which is running what I consider a minimum viable activitypub server called <a href="https://github.com/herestomwiththeweather/irwin">Irwin</a>.  As it is experimental, I am the only user on the server.</p>

<p>So what did I screw up?  I didn’t plan for two things.  Both are related to the diversity of software and configurations on the Fediverse.</p>

<p>First, although I was vaguely aware of the optional <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/admin/config/#authorized_fetch">Authorized Fetch</a> mastodon feature, I didn’t anticipate that it would prevent me from re-following some of my followers.  Prior to the migration, I assumed this feature would not be enabled on any of the servers the people I followed were using.  I quickly realized that I could not re-follow people on 3 servers which had this feature enabled.  So, I lost contact with the people on those servers for a few days until I <a href="https://github.com/herestomwiththeweather/irwin/commit/ba5bd101a5870c50fef8c0312118ae792e85f20e">fixed it</a> by also signing GET requests in addition to POST requests.</p>

<p>Second, I didn’t adequately prepare for the possibility that some of my followers would not automatically move to the new server.  Of 96 followers, I had about 15 that did not successfully re-follow.  It seems that some of these failed because they were not on a Mastodon server and their server did not adequately handle the <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/spec/activitypub/#Move">Move</a> activity sent by mastodon.social.  Unfortunately, although mastodon allowed me to download a csv file of the people I followed, it did not provide a link to download a file of followers so I don’t know everyone I lost during the move.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the move went well and it is a great feature and I’m glad to see <a href="https://w3c.github.io/activitypub/data-portability-report.html">an effort underway to standardize it</a>.</p>

<p>One unresolved issue is that when someone visits my profile on a mastodon site, selecting “open original page” will fetch https://otisburg.social/actor/tom@herestomwiththeweather.com and the user would expect to see my status updates or toots or whatever you call them.  However, currently that url redirects to this website and activitypub status updates are not available here.</p>

   My main development focus this week has been adding public page caching to Datasette Cloud, and exploring what custom template support might look like for that service.

  <p>My main development focus this week has been adding public page caching to <a href="https://www.datasette.cloud/">Datasette Cloud</a>, and exploring what custom template support might look like for that service.</p>
<p>Datasette Cloud primarily provides private "spaces" for teams to collaborate on data. A team can invite additional members, upload CSV files, <a href="https://www.datasette.cloud/docs/api/">use the API to ingest data</a>, <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Dec/1/datasette-enrichments/">run enrichments</a>, share <a href="https://www.datasette.cloud/blog/2023/datasette-comments/">private comments</a> and browse and query the data together.</p>
<p>The overall goal is to help teams find stories in their data.</p>
<p>Originally I planned Datasette Cloud as an exclusively private collaboration space, but with hindsight this was a mistake. Datasette has been a tool for publishing data right <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2017/Nov/13/datasette/">from the start</a>, and Datasette Cloud users quickly started asking for ways to share their data with the world.</p>
<p>I started with a plugin for this, <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-public">datasette-public</a>, allowing tables to be selectively made visible to unauthenticated users.</p>
<p>This raised a couple of challenges though. First, I worry about sudden spikes of traffic. Each Datasette Cloud user gets their own dedicated <a href="https://fly.io/">Fly container</a> to ensure performance issues are isolated and don't affect other users, but I still don't like the idea of a big public traffic spike taking down a user's site.</p>
<p>Secondly, some users expressed interest in customizing the display of their public Datasette instance. The open source Datasette application has <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/custom_templates.html">extensive support for this</a>, but allowing users to run arbitrary HTML and JavaScript on a hosted service is a major risk for XSS holes.</p>
<p>This week I've been exploring a way to address both of these issues.</p>
 Full page caching for unauthorized users 
<p>I've used this trick multiple times through my career - at Lanyrd, at Eventbrite and even for my own personal blog. If a user is signed out, serve them pages through a simple full-page cache - something like Varnish. Set a short TTL on that cache - maybe as short as 15s - such that cached content doesn't have time to go stale.</p>
<p>Good caches include support for dog-pile prevention, also known as request coalescing. If 10 requests come in for the same page at exactly the same moment, the cache bundles them together and makes just a single request to the backend, then serves the result to all 10 waiting clients.</p>
<p>How to implement this for Datasette Cloud? My current plan is to use a separate domain - <code>.datasette.site</code> - for the publicly visible pages of each site. So <code>simon.datasette.cloud</code> (my personal Datasette Cloud space) would have <code>simon.datasette.site</code> as its public domain.</p>
<p>I got this working as a proof-of-concept this week. I actually got it working twice: I figured out how to run a dedicated Varnish instance on Fly, and then I realized that Cloudflare also now <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/wildcard-proxy-for-everyone/">offer wildcard DNS support</a> so I tried that out too.</p>
<p>I have both mechanisms up and running at the moment, on two separate domains. I'll likely go with the Cloudflare option to reduce the number of moving parts I'm responsible for myself, but having both means I can compare them to see which one is likely to work best.</p>
 Custom templates based on host 
<p>The other reason I decided to explore <code>*.datasette.site</code> was the security issue I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p><a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/">XSS attacks</a>, where malicious JavaScript executes on a trusted domain, are a major security risk.</p>
<p>I plan to explore additional layers of protection against these such as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP">CSP headers</a>, but my general rule is to NEVER allow even a chance of untrusted JavaScript executing on a domain where authenticated users are able to perform privileged actions.</p>
<p>My current plan is to have <code>*.datasette.site</code> work as an entirely cookie-free domain. Any functionality that requires authentication will be handled by the privileged <code>*.datasette.cloud</code> domain instead.</p>
<p>This means I can allow users to provide their own custom templates for their public Datasette instance, without worrying that any mistakes in those templates could lead to a security breach elsewhere within the service.</p>
<p>There was just one catch: this meant I needed Datasette to be able to use different templates depending on host that the content was being served on.</p>
<p>After wasting a bunch of time trying to get this to work through monkey-patching, I realized the solution was to add a new plugin hook. <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/plugin_hooks.html#jinja2-environment-from-request-datasette-request-env">jinja2_environment_from_request(datasette, request, env)</a> is now implemented on <code>main</code> and should be out in a new alpha release pretty soon. The documentation for that hook includes an example that hints at how I'm using it for Datasette Cloud.</p>
 Fun further applications of this pattern 
<p>I'm wary of adding features to Datasette that only serve Datasette Cloud. In this case, I realized that the new plugin hook opens up some interesting possibilities for other users of Datasette.</p>
<p>I run a bunch of projects on top of Datasette myself - <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/">til.simonwillison.net</a> and <a href="https://www.niche-museums.com/">www.niche-museums.com</a> are two examples of my sites that are actually templated Datasette instances.</p>
<p>Currently, those sites are hosted separately - which means I'm paying to run Datasette multiple times.</p>
<p>With the ability to serve different templates based on host, I've realized I could instead serve a single Datasette instance for multiple sites, each with their own custom templates.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of CNAMEs - or even wildcard DNS - means I could run a whole family of weird personal projects on a single instance without any incremental cost for each new project!</p>

But when I’m driving, that form is inappropriate: I’ll crash the car. I still want to make progress on my book, though, so wouldn’t it be great if I could flip to the audiobook for the duration of my journey? And then when I’m lying on the sofa later that evening, or sat at my desk, I’d just be able to pick up the book from that point, with a form that made sense for each of those situations. The desk-bound version might have sprawling video illustrations if it made sense for the content; if I’m lying in bed, I just need the text.</p><p>This partially exists today, and a lot of the technical prerequisites are in place, but there’s no great way to seamlessly switch between an audiobook and a book (or text and video, etc). It would be convenient; it would remove friction; it would improve accessibility.</p><p>Two.</p><p>I wish the interiors of homes were modular like computers are modular.</p><p>Today, if I want to install a washing machine, I have to make sure that the space is the right size, that I have the right electricity hookup, and that I have water and drainage. If I want to hang a picture, I have to hammer a nail into the wall or put up command strips that are likely to damage the paint when I take them off.</p><p>What if, instead of electricity plugs and water hookups and drainage, appliances sat in standard-size cradles that were pre-installed in your home? You would always know that an appliance could fit a given cradle, and that it would be provided with the electricity / water / drainage / air it needed.</p><p>What if you could hang pictures on the wall using something like <a href="https://www.belkin.com/clp-what-is-magsafe.html">MagSafe</a>? Just hold them up and they’d snap into place, perfectly straight and aligned? What if that same mechanism could power light fittings and wall-mounted thin appliances, which also attached via magnets?</p><p>What if houses themselves were modular in this way, so that rooms and functions could easily be added or recombined, and what if these components were mass-produced in a way that lowered their cost?</p><p>What if you could attach modular power generation, like solar arrays, wind, and hydro, depending on your location’s characteristics?</p><p>Three.</p><p>I wish it was easier to bend space.</p><p>I don’t mean outer space. I wish I could turn on a portal and walk through and suddenly be in Rome, or Tokyo, or Leamington Spa. Think of it as a personal <a href="https://bigthink.com/starts-with-a-bang/warp-drives-best-hope-dies/">warp drive</a> to go to the shops.</p><p>Sure, you would need to contend with timezone differences. As I write this, it’s 10:30am in Elkins Park, 7:30am in San Francisco, and 4:30pm in Paris. But honestly? I’d find a way to make it work.</p><p>One of the most defining features of the United States is its isolation. It’s harder to get to other places from here than it is from most places. Wouldn’t it be amazing to make those distances go away? You might have to resign yourself to open borders, of course, because there’d be no way to do customs and immigration if anyone could warp anywhere. But I bet we could make that work too.</p><p>(Would that lead to mass, global surveillance? How would it affect policing? Could you imagine trying to catch a criminal who could be literally anywhere in the world? Would we still need roads? So many questions.)</p><p>Four.</p><p>I wish for world peace.</p><p>If you’re rolling your eyes at me right now: fair. I don’t think most people would have read this far if I’d led with this. But, let’s be real: if you can overcome your cynicism for a moment, it would be pretty cool if there was world peace, no?</p><p>The thing is, world peace has all these prerequisites that would also have to be true. If you want world peace, you can’t occupy or exploit someone’s homeland. You can’t plunder their resources. You can’t have colonies or make opportunistic land grabs. You can’t exert your will through authoritarianism. The only way to have lasting peace is for everybody in the world to be able to have a good life, and for it to be generally accepted that this is a good and desirable outcome.</p><p>Which, in turn, means that people need to care about the welfare of their fellow humans who happen to live in other countries or lead wildly different lives to them. It implies not just tolerance, but a kind of love for people whose lives will always remain unseen to you. It means an end to nationalism; a sense of kinship with all people, everywhere.</p><p>It’s a big ask. And I don’t think we’ll get there. But I don’t think it’s necessarily too much to ask.</p><p>Five.</p><p>I wish there was a trustworthy, open AI engine that paid sources for their work.</p><p>Imagine you have an AI agent that is entirely yours. It tells you what you need to know (and what you might want to know), helps you interpret the world, and takes actions on your behalf. It’s a teacher, entertainer, personal assistant and thought partner.</p><p>Imagine that each business can also employ these AI agents, working behind the scenes to make their products and services better. You can interact with them via voice, text, programmatic API, and so on — whatever makes sense for the context they’re employed in.</p><p>Each agent starts with a vanilla dataset of genuinely free and open information. Then, let’s say you want to know about current events: you might add a New York Times subscription, and perhaps a subscription to a local newsroom, to your agent. If you’re a trader, you might add Bloomberg data. If you’re a pilot, you might add up to the second weather information and predictions. If you’re a venture capitalist, you might plug in market information and analysis from experts in segments you invest in.</p><p>It doesn’t happen through a private ecosystem: there’s an open standard through which AI agents discover and connect to new sources, including a mechanism for subscription payments. No one vendor controls the market; any AI engine can connect to new training data, as long as its owner agrees to the terms and pays any fees.</p><p>The journalists at the Times and the local paper, the data room at Bloomberg, the organizations providing the weather sensors and predictions, the analysts: each of these sources get paid on a subscription basis for the data used to augment each individual agent. There’s no exploitation of creators in this system; everyone is paid for their work. And through this system of plugins, users get to use an AI agent that is tailored to their needs and interests.</p><p>Six.</p><p>I wish everyone had access to healthcare.</p><p>“Having access” doesn’t just mean that it exists; it needs to be accessible. You need to be able to walk up and use it, without fear of being turned away, without fear that the financial effects of your care will be adverse, and with full bodily autonomy.</p><p>Easy-to-use, inclusive healthcare, free at the point of use. It would save so many lives. And even beyond that, it would remove a cognitive load that many people in America simply live with: a fear that something will go wrong with their health and they will ruin their lives in order to deal with it. Imagine what people could do if they weren’t afraid of having their basic needs met.</p><p>Even if you’re lucky enough to not have to worry about money, the act of having to choose health insurance, potentially figure out an HSA, pick a provider, etc, is a hassle that no-one really needs. I certainly don’t. Just make it one, continuous healthcare system.</p><p>Seven.</p><p>I think I wish we could bend time, too.</p><p>Imagine if you could hit pause and create a time bubble for yourself: a weekend temporally alone, with no requirements or restrictions looming over you. You could read a book, or do research, or bend space and go see a beautiful glacier halfway across the world. And then your bubble would end and you’d be back in the temporal world, refreshed or illuminated.</p><p>Of course, you’d continue to age in the time bubble, so you’d shorten your effective life — which is to say, the surface area of your life that interacts with everyone else. But your experiential life wouldn’t be any shorter. How you’d use this ability might depend on who you were and what you cared about; someone with loved ones or dependents might be more likely to live a temporally-aligned life, while someone without might live more of their life in a bubble. A monk might disappear into solitude and emerge - poof! - having apparently aged forty years in the blink of an eye.</p><p>It would need to be free from abuse. You can easily imagine a factory forcing its entire workforce to live in a time bubble in order to more quickly construct its products, literally working their lives away and being robbed of time with their families in the name of someone else’s profit. It would be murder, in a way.</p><p>But if it was entirely up to you? If you just needed a little more time here and there? Magic. I bet it might even make your life longer, despite everything.</p><p>Eight.</p><p>I wish we could take all the people who want to <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2023/12/the-web-floods/">flood the web with AI-generated content</a> and relegate them to their own mirror internet.</p><p>They wouldn’t know. They’d just be happily posting their ersatz thinkpieces at each other, giddily generating their one-sentence-per-paragraph LinkedIn updates and dumping them into the hustlenet, and we’d all be off on the real, human internet, communicating with each other in peace and tranquility.</p><p>Nine.</p><p>I wish there was a way to help build and fund end-user open source software.</p><p>Here’s how my imaginary program would work. There would be a pot of money at the center of it, managed by a foundation or an endowment of some kind, that would be ring-fenced to support software in the public interest. There would be no expectation that these projects would be self-sustaining: the fund would pay for them.</p><p>A call for applications would be made every so often. Teams could apply if they’d built an initial version. They would be expected to be able to explain the human impact of that software, and prove that it would be useful to real people. They wouldn’t get funding if they didn’t know who their users were, or hadn’t validated their product with real people.</p><p>The fund would pick six projects every cycle (perhaps every year), and guarantee a stipend that would last at least two years to work on that project. If that project continued to make a real human impact after that period, it would be renewed for another two years. In addition to releasing software, projects would be expected to transparently share their thinking, their research, and findings as they went.</p><p>Projects related to the fund, and alumni of past projects, would be expected to help each other, contribute to each other’s projects, and share their experiences. There would be a curriculum to help teams get on top of design and user experience, and to communicate effectively. The aim of the whole thing would be to make end-user open source projects more sustainable and more empathy-driven.</p><p>Ten.</p><p>I wish everyone would blog. Or write, otherwise. Or take photographs or make music or paint or sculpt or do whatever makes sense to tell their stories.</p><p>But mostly blog. I love these public journals that everyone can read. I love learning about people and what makes them excited about the world and what they’re worried about.</p><p>You should all blog. All of you. I think the world is better when everyone’s voices can be shared and heard. And I want to hear yours.</p><p>Eleven.</p><p>I wish there was a cure for dyskeratosis congenita, and for every genetic condition.</p><p>Literally <a href="https://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/health/d/dyskeratosis-congenita#:~:text=Dyskeratosis%20congenita%20(DC)%20is%20a,million%20people%20has%20this%20condition.">one in a million people</a> have DC. Unfortunately, I’ve been related to five of them (so far). We lost people we love to an illness that is still barely understood: my mother, my grandmother, my aunt, and two beloved cousins.</p><p>Because it’s so rare, it doesn’t achieve the funding that more common conditions receive. Some of its symptoms - <a href="https://www.pulmonaryfibrosis.org/">pulmonary fibrosis</a>, for example - do receive more attention, because they’re shared with other conditions. But the underlying cause remains niche.</p><p>It’s not niche to me.</p><p>And there are so many other conditions that have few sufferers overall, but where the impact on individual families is seismic. I wish there were cures. I wish that technology like <a href="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/CRISPR">CRISPR</a> could evolve, perhaps in tandem with AI, to be able to address all of these illnesses, even when they’re rare.</p><p>Twelve.</p><p>I wish Google Maps, Apple Maps — all of the maps — took my idiosyncratic preferences into account when they drew a route.</p><p>When I ask for directions, it’s usually true that I want the roads that provide the fastest route. But sometimes, in a way that’s hard for an algorithm to predict based on logical rules, I don’t.</p><p>There’s a main road near me that leads to the Turnpike. I can take another main road to get there, or I can cut down a smaller road that takes me past the Target and the Home Depot. It’s theoretically smaller and slower, but what the mapping apps don’t know is that the route they want to take me on has a really uneven surface. I don’t want to take it; not ever. I want to go the tiny Home Depot / Target road, even though it’s worse on paper.</p><p>So, learn from me. App, you know when I ignore your advice and constantly use another road. Take the hint, please.</p><p>Because here’s the thing: I’m still relatively new to my area, I don’t always know where I’m going, and sometimes I don’t realize I’m going on the bad road until it’s too late. So I could use a little help.</p><p>Thirteen.</p><p>I wish AI-generated presenters would embrace their artificiality and really just push the boat out.</p><p>If you’re going to have a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/oct/20/here-is-the-news-you-cant-stop-us-ai-anchor-zae-in-grants-us-an-interview">photorealistic AI newsreader</a>, why on earth would you make them look like any other person? We have people.</p><p>The galaxy brain version of this idea is to make them into the perfect newscaster: something that could only be achieved with AI. Give them a bigger, multidimensional mouth for stronger enunciation. Give them large, resonant eyes for enhanced empathy. Give them bunny ears <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_Bunny">as a deep cut reference</a>. Give them tentacles, because tentacles are cool.</p><p>Or perhaps you could have a sentient plasma read the news. Or the visual embodiment of the concept of gravity. Or the collective half-remembering of a song you used to know. The point is, there’s an enormous creative canvas here, and recreating an actual human being that you could have just gone ahead and hired seems like you’re leaving a creative opportunity on the table.</p><p>Fourteen.</p><p>I wish we had fully-electric, nationwide high speed rail, with satellite internet, sleeper cars, private rooms, cafes and restaurants. Let’s make them cool.</p><p>They probably couldn’t beat air travel on speed for longer distances, but they can be more comfortable, and they can let people work en route. There’s no need for them to mimic air travel in the way they do today: the space could be mixed-use, walkable, and luxurious.</p><p>Rail travel is already an experience (if you’ve never <a href="https://www.amtrakvacations.com/vacation-types/cross-country-train-trips">traveled coast to coast on Amtrak</a>, you should; it’s one of the best things I’ve ever done). But it could be turned up to 11, and the speed could be turned up to 110.</p><p>Fifteen.</p><p>I wish my mother had met my son.</p><p>I wish he had her in his life.</p><p>I think about this daily.</p><p>Sixteen.</p><p>I wish we could find make all of this amazing technology without exploiting other nations, which means without <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/15/how-conflict-minerals-make-it-into-our-phones.html">conflict minerals</a>.</p><p>We may be able to replace rare earth elements with <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170919091029.htm">carbon nanomaterials like graphene</a>, which in turn can be <a href="https://www.azonano.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=6390">created from raw ingredients like wood ash and even household waste</a>. I think this is an obvious shift that’s coming down the pipe, but I wish we could be there now.</p><p>I love my iPhone; I love my electric car; I don’t want people to suffer because I own these things. I don’t want these tools to contribute to inequalities between nations. And I want everyone to be able to own one. (And I bet the relative abundance of these new materials will lead to all kinds of new amazing tech.)</p><p>Seventeen.</p><p>I wish I could find a way to be the American franchisee / importer for:</p>  <a href="https://www.greggs.co.uk/">Gregg’s the bakers</a>: sort of the UK’s answer to Wawa or Tim Hortons (without the gas station association). This would make a killing in places like NYC, in the same way that <a href="https://www.pret.com/en-US">Pret</a> has managed to take hold. Call me a maverick, but I think America will appreciate sausage rolls. Even the vegan ones. 
 <a href="https://www.innocentdrinks.co.uk/home">Innocent Drinks smoothies</a>. (I guess there would need to be a US version of <a href="https://www.innocentdrinks.co.uk/a-bit-about-us/the-blender">the Blender</a>, their impressively sustainable factory in Rotterdam.) 
 I was going to say <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caledonian_Brewery">Caledonian Brewing Company beers</a>, but it turns out they’ve been shut down since I was last in Scotland. I wish the Caledonian Brewing Company was still around. C’mon. 
 <p>Eighteen.</p><p>I wish for real journalism to flourish.</p><p>I’m talking about newsrooms that speak truth to power, elevate lived experiences we might not otherwise hear about, and help us understand our world in a way that allows us to make better democratic decisions, yes, but also allows us to know who we are as a country, and understand where we are as a world.</p><p>From local police departments who act above the law because they think they’ll avoid scrutiny to governments who make deals and build strategy at the expense of entire communities, more light needs to be shone.</p><p>I’m not talking about both-sidesism here — <a href="https://badgerherald.com/opinion/2017/11/28/the-new-york-times-once-embraced-fascism-today-they-humanize-nazis/">“we went to a Nazi bar and here’s why they think their ideology is great.”</a> — although truth be told, I think this kind of anthropology does have some value as long as you don’t fall into the trap of promoting or whitewashing their ideas or presenting them without the required context, because, at least in theory, if you can understand people, you can understand how to prevent these violent ideologies from rising again. (Too many people believe that Hitler was some kind of freakish aberration and not something that could easily happen again, even in a democratic society. Even now.)</p><p>And I’m not talking about industry puff pieces (so much tech industry journalism in particular is horrible, cheerleading stuff that celebrates wealth and power; thank the gods for <a href="https://themarkup.org/">the Markup</a>, <a href="https://www.404media.co/">404 Media</a>, and <a href="https://www.platformer.news/">Platformer</a>) or the kind of local journalism that riles up prejudices and does nothing close to speaking truth to power.</p><p>I’m talking about the kind of journalism that shines a light on corruption, prevents peoples’ suffering, and <a href="https://werd.io/2023/always-punch-up-1">punches up</a> in the public interest. We need more of it. It needs to flourish. Particularly in this moment; particularly this year. In service of democracy and the well-being of the vulnerable and oppressed, in the face of widespread corruption, war, the climate crisis, and the continued rise of toxic nationalism, let a thousand newsrooms bloom.</p><p>Nineteen.</p><p>I wish I didn’t have to worry about our son’s safety.</p><p>As I write this, he’s just turned sixteen months old. He’s tall for his age: in the 99th percentile for height, looking much more like a three-year-old than the barely-a-toddler he really is.</p><p>He goes to a Jewish daycare center, and I worry about anti-semitism and what people might do to find belonging in some hateful community or to service a racist notion. Not so long ago, someone threatened the local synagogues and schools and I shot out of my office to go pick him up. The police said it was not a credible threat, but who wants to take that chance?</p><p>He also lives in America, a country where people are allowed to keep AR-15s and concealed handguns in support of entirely fictional ideas like defending themselves against a despotic government, and I wonder what someone with a gun might do. Not today, but perhaps some day: a disaffected fellow student at their school, or a misguided friend picking up a weapon that their parent owns.</p><p>I wish I didn’t have to think about this every time I drop him off, but I do. I wish I didn’t have to worry about who we know — or who he knows — might have a gun. I wish we didn’t think having these weapons around us was normal. I wish we didn’t continue to normalize them. I wish all of them were gone.</p><p>Twenty.</p><p>While we’re at it, I wish we didn’t, as a society, love cars that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21065319/suv-truck-front-blindspot-children-injury-death-wthr-13">make it impossible to see my son from the driver’s seat</a>.</p><p>There’s nothing wrong with small cars (except for <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/activism/young-people-driving-safety-cost-climate-change-public-transportation/">the not-insignificant baseline of things that are wrong with all cars</a>). <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/11/14/1212737005/cars-trucks-pedestrian-deaths-increase-crash-data">Bigger cars kill more pedestrians and are far more likely to kill children</a>. I wish we could all downsize a little.</p><p>But don’t take this the wrong way: my wish is not a criticism of people who have big cars. I know some very lovely people who have them and love them. They just scare me, is all, because I’m worried someone is going to hit my child with one, and rather than pointing fingers at anyone, I’d rather the whole ecosystem of cars was a little smaller.</p><p>Twenty-One.</p><p>I wish I could take a year off and just tinker.</p><p>I’m not sure how that would work in practice. I can’t afford to, for one thing, and I’m lucky enough to actually love my work, so I’d miss it. But it would be lovely to take some downtime and focus on creative projects.</p><p>Creative projects, for me, fall into three broad buckets:</p>  Writing 
 Websites 
 Software 
 <p>Writing is exactly what you think: I have a book in progress, and I’d like to finish it. Then I’d like to write another one. I have some stories that I think are worth telling.</p><p>Websites are stand-alone projects like <a href="https://getblogging.org">Get Blogging!</a> that try to inform, entertain, or provide help.</p><p>And software is homegrown products like <a href="https://withknown.com">Known</a> that I think other people might find useful.</p><p>What if there was a sort of angel investment agreement where someone gave you a salary for a year and took 40% ownership of whatever you created, with the promise that you’d spend the time actively trying to create things? Depending on who was offering, I’d probably take that.</p><p>Twenty-Two.</p><p>I wish something like DAOs had taken off.</p><p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization">Decentralized Autonomous Organization</a> is a leaderless organization managed through software, where decisions are made through voting and voting rights are conferred through ownership of cryptocurrency.</p><p>They’re flawed in two key ways:</p>  They confer more power to people who already have it, because your voting share increases with the amount of cryptocurrency you buy. People with more wealth can therefore have more say — <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160791X23000568?via%3Dihub">and usually do</a>. 
 They use and depend on cryptocurrency, meaning that votes and ownership are always financial transactions. 
 <p>While these flaws meant that DAOs were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_on_arrival">DOA</a>, the idea of a leaderless organization with voting rights that are automatically enforced is interesting to me. What if we removed the financial component and overhauled the voting system to be one-member-per-vote? It might look a lot like a software-enhanced co-operative, and would be useful for everything from mutual aid to global movements to a family co-managing a house, all with enforced democracy and a careful audit trail.</p><p>Twenty-Three.</p><p>I wish we could move away from GDP as a metric for collective well-being.</p><p>Chiefly because it isn’t a metric for human well-being: it’s an imperfect measure of economic output that was designed for wartime conditions.</p><p><a href="https://hbr.org/2019/10/gdp-is-not-a-measure-of-human-well-being">Amit Kapoor and Bibek Debroy in HBR</a>:</p><blockquote><p>We know now that the story is not so simple – that focusing exclusively on GDP and economic gain to measure development ignores the negative effects of economic growth on society, such as climate change and income inequality. It’s time to acknowledge the limitations of GDP and expand our measure development so that it takes into account a society’s quality of life.</p></blockquote><p>So while we can talk about economic growth and hold it up as a sign of success all we want, it doesn’t at all mean that the average quality of life has gone up, or that we’ve dealt with issues like the climate crisis that will affect the quality of life of future generations.</p><p>GDP doesn’t ask if our experience as humans is improving, and it really doesn’t ask if the experience of our worst-off people is improving. I’d love to see us focus more on measuring that, rather than relying on the assumption that if the country is getting richer as a whole, everyone will see the benefit. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/oct/09/why-is-trickle-down-economics-still-with-us">It’s simply not true.</a> Either we need to admit that we simply don’t create about most people’s lives, or we need to find another measure.</p><p>Twenty-Four.</p><p>I wish AI copilot for software development worked in a more literate way.</p><p>By “literate” I mean <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">literate programming</a>, a defined methodology where you write what you want your program to do in a descriptive, human language first, with snippets of code included almost as illustrations of their written counterparts.</p><p>Tools like <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/github-copilot">GitHub Copilot</a> let you write prompts in English, which the system then automatically replaces with an appropriate snippet of source code in the desired language. Like all AI output, it often needs a little editing, but it’s surprisingly magical.</p><p>I think AI code generation has the potential to replace software libraries in many cases. When you use a third-party library, you’re importing code that someone else has written to serve a particular function: parsing an RSS feed, say, or sorting an array of variables in a particular way. With code generation, you can prompt the engine to add RSS parsing or array sorting code, and it’ll appear as if by magic. And, unlike a library, that code will be written for you, and may be a better fit for how you want the software you’re writing to work.</p><p>There are a few limitations, beyond the usual ones that accompany all generative AI:</p>  While a library author will (hopefully) continuously update their code, your AI-generated code is frozen in aspic. You’ll have to update it yourself. If everyone uses AI for a particular function, it’s also possible that those engines will never update their approach to that particular problem, because there will be no new approaches to train them on. 
 Your AI-enhanced code is generated prompt by prompt, rather than holistically in the context of the intention behind your whole project. 
 <p>That second bullet is what I’m getting at here. What if an AI engine could look at a whole literate project in context?</p><p><a href="https://fgiasson.com/blog/index.php/2023/09/22/literate-programming-at-the-dawn-of-llms/">The data engineer Frederick Giasson experimented with this</a> and concluded that Copilot was context-aware within a file (or <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter notebook</a>). What if it could take the whole project into account, with an accompanying UI that made specifying your applicable intentions, ethics, and values as well as your logical approach easy? Making these things explicit in the context of a body of source code, in a way that affects how that code is written and logically interpreted, is really interesting to me.</p><p>Twenty-Five.</p><p>I wish we had a pantheon of really positive science fiction stories to work from: takes where everything has worked out.</p><p>Star Trek is a little bit like that, but not really: the Federation is militaristic in nature, and while its participants have been drawn from disparate worlds and contexts, its culture is pretty homogenous. I don’t know that that’s what we should be aiming for.</p><p>Most of the science fiction I’ve watched or read over the last few years in particular has been willfully dystopian. Even Doctor Who, which is more fantasy than science fiction to begin with but plays with notions of whimsy and radical inclusion, has both feet set in the aftermath of a great war. The science fiction I’m writing — in part about the idea that the thing that will bring us down in the climate crisis is not the crisis itself but our need to profit from it — crosses that line too.</p><p>The problem is, <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/tech-billionaires-need-to-stop-trying-to-make-the-science-fiction-they-grew-up-on-real/">as Charles Stross pointed out in Scientific American recently</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Billionaires who grew up reading science-fiction classics published 30 to 50 years ago are affecting our life today in almost too many ways to list: Elon Musk wants to colonize Mars. Jeff Bezos prefers 1970s plans for giant orbital habitats.  Peter Thiel is funding research into artificial intelligence, life extension and “seasteading.” Mark Zuckerberg has blown $10 billion trying to create the Metaverse from Neal Stephenson’s novel Snow Crash. And Marc Andreessen of the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz has published a “techno-optimist manifesto” promoting a bizarre accelerationist philosophy that calls for an unregulated, solely capitalist future of pure technological chaos.</p></blockquote><p>We need to be able to imagine a really great future in order to get there. I think we’ve lost that muscle. We’ve ceded optimism to <a href="https://a16z.com/the-techno-optimist-manifesto/">people who seek to create an adverse future</a>. It’s easy to see how we got here — the world often feels oppressive — but it’s imperative that we re-find the sunlight.</p><p>There are positive science fiction movements: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solarpunk">solarpunk</a>, for example. I’d love to see more; I’d love to read more. Perhaps write more?</p><p>Twenty-Six.</p><p>I wish I was better at seeing my friends. Or, at least, keeping up with them.</p><p>I’ve never regretted moving to the US — supporting my terminally ill mother was a very good reason — but I’ve missed a lot of people. I made a lot of friends in the twelve years I’ve been here, and moving from California to Pennsylvania was almost the same level of severance, although the pandemic has made us all far more used to hanging out online.</p><p>There was a time, when I was much younger, when I could send a text that read:</p><blockquote><p>Pub?</p></blockquote><p>And an hour later I’d be hanging out with friends, having a few drinks (alcoholic and otherwise), talking about anything and everything. I really deeply miss being able to do that.</p><p>Twenty-Seven.</p><p>I wish for everyone I love to be healthy.</p><p>I wish for everyone I love to be happy.</p><p>I wish for everyone I love to be here.</p><p>Twenty-Eight.</p><p>I wish every software development team stopped to ask:</p>  Who, exactly, are we building this for? 
 Is it the right thing? 
 Why do they need it? 
 How do we know? 
 If we are successful, who will be impacted? 
 How can we ensure that as many people as possible see the benefits? 
 <p>There’s an idea that software is somehow outside of the human sphere, a world of discrete logic and objectivity. It’s not, and the more we acknowledge and internalize how human software actually is, the more useful and world-positive it becomes.</p><p>You don’t build software for everyone, because that’s the same as building it for no-one. You build it for specific people, serve their needs deeply, and expand from there. How do you know their needs? Because you know them, not as abstracted-away personas or vague market notions, but as real, concrete human beings who you’ve met with and understood.</p><p>Building useful software is an exercise in engineering, of course. But more than that, it’s an exercise in empathy, of human relationships, and of community. I wish that was universally acknowledged and built directly into both engineering processes and team cultures by default.</p><p>Twenty-Nine.</p><p>I wish I’d been to the Philadelphia Museum of Art.</p><p>This one seems particularly fixable, right? I’ve lived in the Greater Philadelphia area for a year. One of the best art museums in the country (maybe the world) is downtown. I think art is important; I like art; art makes me happy. I should have been by now.</p><p>But, of course, life happens, and there’s always something more important to do. There are chores to do for the baby, and things to do for the house, and admin stuff more generally, and work, and we need groceries, and there are other, closer trips to be had. There are so many things. And before you know it, it’s been a year, and this thing that I knew I wanted to do before I got here remains undone. And then before I know it, it’ll be another year, and another, and I’ll have blinked and life will have flowed all the way through my fingers.</p><p>It’s not really about the Philadelphia Museum of Art, of course. But it is about intentionality, and about self-care, and prioritization.</p><p>Maybe I’ll go next weekend. Unless something comes up.</p><p>Thirty.</p><p>I wish I could sing and play guitar.</p><p><a href="https://werd.io/2023/noah">My cousin Noah</a> wrote these lovely songs for his wife, for his children, for his cousins. Music was such a core part of his life, and it became a core part of the lives of the people closest to him.</p><p>I love that spirit, and I wish I could embody that in some way. It’s not about a particular artistry or form; it’s about being able to convey the underlying emotion. In a very real way, it’s about love.</p><p>I miss Noah. I wish he was here.</p><p>Thirty-One.</p><p>I wish we could nudge our rhetoric from “trust experts” to “work with experts”.</p><p>The “trust experts” line comes from the pandemic, when skeptics and anti-vaxxers were urged to trust the scientific advice we were being given. In that context, and to that audience, I think it’s obviously right: the level of misinformation was intense, and intensely politicized, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/05/16/1099070400/how-vaccine-misinformation-made-the-covid-19-death-toll-worse">which led to real loss of life</a>.</p><p>On the other hand, if we’re talking about smart people engaging in their own lines of informed inquiry, I think it’s safe to expand the discourse. Experts are a resource, and their expertise deserves respect. But there can also be edges to their expertise, and engaging with them may expand the knowledge frontier for both of you.</p><p>A very concrete example in my own life was my mother’s idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, which was rapidly re-labeled to familial pulmonary fibrosis. “Pulmonary fibrosis” is the name for the symptom, not the cause; “idiopathic” means the cause was unknown. We worked with the doctors, and did our own research, read scientific papers, and arrived at the conclusion that it was dyskeratosis congenita, which then informed the hospital’s own line of inquiry. Ultimately, this was proven to be correct, but we might not have arrived at this understanding (at least on the same timeline) if we hadn’t done our own work, and if the experts hadn’t been open to working with us.</p><p>Science can be a conversation. I think medicine certainly should be. It has to be one grounded in science and fact, of course: it’s hard to have a conversation with someone who thinks a medicine can make you magnetic or that it’s part of a mass conspiracy. But I think sometimes we can be a little too hard-line in our discourse about who should be listened to and who should not.</p><p>Thirty-Two.</p><p>I wish civilization was further along than it is.</p><p>I’m typing this in my house, which is really four walls in the dirt, themselves made of different kinds of mud and stone. A great deal of heat is escaping through the windows, which are made of liquid sand that have been reshaped into thin, brittle panes.</p><p>I have to worry about whether the food I eat is good for me, and who picked it, or how it was gathered or killed. Outside in the drive, there’s a car that runs on condensed million-year-old plants, and there’s a car that runs on electricity. Both cars contain rare elements that were mined in parts of the world that have been subjugated by my part of the world so that the cars and computers and batteries can be made.</p><p>We’ve come so far, but there’s so much left to achieve. I wish we were there. I wish all food was good for me and ethically sourced, and that all my useful devices were made of good things that harmed nobody, and that everybody had the ability to own one and nobody wanted for any necessities at all except to further the collective experience of being human.</p><p>It seems silly that we have to worry about war and poverty and inequality and exploitation and hatred. We don’t need those things. Some of them were a part of early civilization but that doesn’t means they need to continue for us to succeed. That’s the <a href="https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/the-sunk-cost-fallacy">sunk cost fallacy</a> in action right there. We can build something new. I wish we would. I want to live in the future.</p><p>Thirty-Three.</p><p>I wish movies would be available on streaming on day one.</p><p>You’re probably not going to get me into a theater anytime soon. Don’t get me wrong: I love movies and the theater experience of seeing something in a room with lots of other people. It can be magical. But worrying about the pandemic, and worrying about finding a babysitter, kind of take the shine off.</p><p>I want to sit in my living room, under my fluffy blanket, with my own food and my own drinks, in the knowledge that I’m probably not going to get a serious infectious disease and that I can pause the movie if the baby wakes up.</p><p>I’d still like the option of going to the theater. Again: theaters are great. But right now, they’re not things that fit in well with my life.</p><p>I’m not alone. Just let us stream. We’ll pay.</p><p>Thirty-Four.</p><p>I wish the internet was exactly the same for everyone in every location, and that every website was equally as fast.</p><p>I wish there was full privacy and freedom from tracking built into the platform.</p><p>I wish the major conduits for sharing and learning online were collaboratively built rather than privately owned.</p><p>I wish the web in particular was about sharing and advancing knowledge, connecting people with each other’s lived experiences, supporting democracy, and improving our collective well-being.</p><p>I wish it was owned by everybody and nobody.</p><p>I wish everybody had access.</p><p>Thirty-Five.</p><p>I wish to only work in organizations that value DEI for the rest of my career. Although every organization is different, and the experience of working at them varies, it’s always a good sign.</p><p>I wish inclusion was universally seen as the obviously good thing it is, and that it was understood to be a prerequisite for responsibly building any company or institution.</p><p>Thirty-Six.</p><p>I wish there was software that could take a look at your life and show you different versions of it.</p><p>Think about those photography AI tools: things like FaceApp that, with a click of a button, can tell you what you’d look like if you were the opposite gender, or older, or younger, or a little more masculine, a little more feminine, a little better or worse looking. With a click of a button they can make you smile like you mean it, or give you a more expensive haircut.</p><p>Imagine you could push a button that said, “show me a version of myself where I was truly happy.” The software would examine your life, think for a little bit, and then give you a complete picture: a photograph of the happiest version of yourself, and a description of all the little details that add up to you. With another button, perhaps it could offer you a diff: here’s all the things that are different. And with a third, here’s how you can get to that version of your life from this one.</p><p>You could ask it what your life would look like if you were wealthy, or if you had no money at all, or if you lived alone or had a big family. It could shard you into fragments and possibilities and you could map all the different yous until you found one that looked right.</p><p>I wonder if, given the map, you’d actually follow the steps and make it to this other, hypothetical version of yourself, or if you’d stay put, safe in the knowledge that actually, you’re good where you are. I wonder, if you did take those steps and made it there, if you’d actually be in any way happier or more content, or if the knowledge of your original life and what you’d lost would invalidate it all: if those other selves are only valid in their vacuums.</p><p>I wish the software existed so we could know what was possible within our own lives. I don’t think I’d want to take the steps and get there. But the perspective? Perspective always changes everything.</p><p>Thirty-Seven.</p><p>I wish for us to be able to give our son every opportunity, every life experience, every freedom, every possible gesture of love and care.</p><p>I would love for him to have broad horizons, a non-conformist attitude, a global outlook, an inclusive heart, and a progressive mind. I would love for him to understand his radical interdependence with every other person rather than wild independence. We’re going to love him whoever he chooses to be. We’re going to show him the world.</p><p>Thirty-Eight.</p><p>I wish that everybody had the right to full self-determination for their identity.</p><p>I wish that the people I know who have had to fight so hard just to be themselves could relax, safe in the knowledge that they were safe from discrimination and harm.</p><p>I wish they knew that the identity they worked so hard to establish is how they would be known, without question or argument.</p><p>I mean, it’s just common decency.</p><p>Thirty-Nine.</p><p>I wish our personalities weren’t so siloed.</p><p>Just because I encounter someone in a business context, it doesn’t mean I only want to see the business facet of who they are. I want to learn how they think about the world: what kind of art they love, how they’re weird, what they’re proud of.</p><p>I feel that way about personal websites a lot: they tend to stick to the same form and topics. They couldbe jumping from topic to topic, exploring what they’re excited by, describing what makes them feel alive. They could be experimenting with form: a graphic novel here, spoken-word poetry there. Everyone’s public persona is the above-water tip of an iceberg of creativity and excitement that we mostly don’t let anybody else see. But that’s the stuff that really makes us human; it’s what makes us interesting and unique.</p><p>I know this is complicated for a hundred reasons, not least because it’s easier for people with privilege than people from more vulnerable or underrepresented contexts, but I feel like if we were all more comfortable to share more of ourselves, so much more would be possible. If we were more uninhibited to share our creative ideas with each other, we might see more interesting collaborations; innovations that otherwise would never have been possible. If we increase the surface area of our possible connections, we increase the chances that one of those connections hits home so deeply and meaningfully that it changes our lives.</p><p>I want you to feel free to share more of you. I want to feel free to share more of me. Let’s make a pact to give ourselves the freedom to be human, to experiment with form and creativity, to make things that don’t work, to just go for it and see what happens.</p><p>I don’t think we can do that if the form of our communications is limited to a small text box owned by some company somewhere, where the user experience has been optimized and averaged-out in order to maximize engagement and revenue. I think we need to own our communications again, stop sanding off our edges or letting people with a profit motive sand our edges off for us. Let’s be weird. Let’s whisper and shout and sing. Let’s try new shit. I wish we could all stop being beige and start being our full selves with each other. I wish we could stop trying to fit ourselves into boxes that other people have made for us. Let’s burn the boxes to the fucking ground.</p><p>Forty.</p><p>I wish I could undo many things. Just strip them from reality.</p><p>I also wish I could re-do many things. As in, have a do-over. Take another run at them and hopefully do better.</p><p>And I wish I could re-experience many things. Just live through them again, savoring every second, because I know I’ll never get those moments back, that they are perfect and fleeting and gone.</p><p>Forty-One.</p><p>I wish to be a better partner. I wish to be a better parent. I wish to be a better person. (I’ll keep working.)</p><p>Forty-Two.</p><p>I wish for a climate in balance that can support every person and every living thing on the planet.</p><p>There are so many prerequisites; so many things that have to radically change. I wish for every single decision and dramatic transformation it’ll take to get there.</p><p>Forty-Three.</p><p>I wish for mutual respect: for ourselves, for our fellow people, for the world and the ecosystem around us, regardless of proximity or origin.</p><p>Forty-Four.</p><p>I wish for community. I wish for collective empowerment. I wish for inclusion. I wish for a broad awareness of the interrelatedness of all people and all things.</p><p>Forty-Five.</p><p>I wish to continue living. I wish to live more: a long life that is vibrant, unique, kinetic, and full of light. I wish that for every single one of us.</p>

  <p>Update 9th January 2024: This post was clumsily written and failed to make the point I wanted it to make. I've published a follow-up, <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jan/9/what-i-should-have-said-about-ai/">What I should have said about the term Artificial Intelligence</a> which you should read instead.</p>
<p>My original post follows.</p>

 
<p>We need to be having high quality conversations about AI: what it can and can't do, its many risks and pitfalls and how to integrate it into society in the most beneficial ways possible.</p>
<p>Any time I write anything that <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai/">mentions AI</a> it's inevitable that someone will object to the very usage of the term.</p>
<p>Strawman: "Don't call it AI! It's not actually intelligent - it's just spicy autocomplete."</p>
<p>That strawman is right: it's not "intelligent" in the same way that humans are. And "spicy autocomplete" is actually a pretty good analogy for how a lot of these things work. But I still don't think this argument is a helpful contribution to the discussion.</p>
<p>We need an agreed term for this class of technology, in order to have conversations about it. I think it's time to accept that "AI" is good enough, and is already widely understood.</p>
<p>I've fallen for this trap myself. Every time I write a headline about AI I find myself reaching for terms like "LLMs" or "Generative AI", because I worry that the term "Artificial Intelligence" over-promises and implies a false mental model of a sci-fi system like Data from Star Trek, not the predict-next-token technology we are building with today.</p>
<p>I've decided to cut that out. I'm going to embrace the term Artificial Intelligence and trust my readers to understand what I mean without assuming I'm talking about Skynet.</p>
<p>The term "Artificial Intelligence" has been in use by academia since 1956, with the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_workshop">Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence</a> - this field of research is nearly 70 years old now!</p>
<p>John McCarthy's 2nd September 1955 proposal for that workshop included this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The study is to proceed on the basis of the conjecture that every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it. An attempt will be made to find how to make machines use language, form abstractions and concepts, solve kinds of problems now reserved for humans, and improve themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this is a very strong definition, which fits well with the AI models and use-cases we are talking about today. Let's use it.</p>

 Why not LLMs? 

<p>I've spent the past year mainly talking about <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/llms/">LLMs</a> - Large Language Models - often as an alternative to the wider term "AI".</p>

<p>While this term is accurate, it comes with a very significant downside: most people still don't know what it means.</p>
<p>I find myself starting every article with "Large Language Models (LLMs), the technology behind ChatGPT and Google Bard..."</p>
<p>I don't think this is helpful. Why use a relatively obscure term I have to define every single time, just because the word "intelligence" in the common acronym AI might be rejected by some readers?</p>
<p>The term LLM is already starting to splinter as language models go multi-modal. I've seen the term "LMMs" for Large Multimodal Models start to circulate, which risks introducing yet another piece of jargon that people need to understand in order to comprehend my writing!</p>

 The argument against using the term AI 

<p>My link to this post <a href="https://fedi.simonwillison.net/@simon/111711738419044973">on Mastodon</a> has attracted thoughtful commentary that goes well beyond the straw man argument I posed above.</p>

<p>The thing that's different with the current wave of AI tools, most notably LLMs, is that at first glance they really do look like the AI from science fiction. You can have conversations with them, they exhibit knowledge of a vast array of things, and it's easy to form an initial impression of them that puts them at the same level of "intelligence" as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.A.R.V.I.S.">Jarvis</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_(Star_Trek)">Data</a>, or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_(character)">T-800</a>.</p>

<p>The more time you spend with them, and the more you understand about how they work, the more this illusion falls apart as their many flaws start to become apparent.</p>

<p>Where this gets actively harmful is when people start to deploy systems under the assumption that these tools really are trustworthy, intelligent systems - capable of making decisions that have a real impact on people's lives.</p>

<p>This is the thing we have to fight back against: we need to help people overcome their science fiction priors, understand exactly what modern AI systems are capable of, how they can be used responsibly and what their limitations are.</p>

<p>I don't think refusing to use the term AI is an effective tool to help us do that.</p>

 

 

 Let's tell people it's "not AGI" instead 
<p>If we're going to use "Artificial Intelligence" to describe the entire field of machine learning, generative models, deep learning, computer vision and so on... what should we do about the science fiction definition of AI that's already lodged in people's heads?</p>
<p>Our goal here is clear: we want people to understand that the LLM-powered tools they are interacting with today aren't actually anything like the omniscient AIs they've seen in science fiction for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erewhon">past ~150 years</a>.</p>
<p>Thankfully there's a term that's a good fit for this goal already: AGI, for "Artificial General Intelligence". This is generally understood to mean AI that matches or exceeds human intelligence.</p>
<p>AGI itself is vague and infuriatingly hard to define, but in this case I think that's a feature. "ChatGPT isn't AGI" is an easy statement to make, and I don't think its accuracy is even up for debate.</p>
<p>The term is right there for the taking. "You're thinking about science fiction there: ChatGPT isn't AGI, like in the movies. It's just an AI language model that can predict next tokens to generate text."</p>
 Miscellaneous additional thoughts 
<p>There's so much good stuff in <a href="https://fedi.simonwillison.net/@simon/111711738419044973">the conversation</a> about this post. I already added the new sections <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jan/7/call-it-ai/#why-not-llms">Why not LLMs?</a>, <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jan/7/call-it-ai/#argument-against">The argument against using the term AI</a> and <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jan/7/call-it-ai/#not-agi-instead">Let’s tell people it’s “not AGI” instead</a> based on those comments.</p>
<p>I'll collect a few more miscellaneous thoughts in this section, which I may continue to grow in the future.</p>
 
 I've seen a few reactions to this post that appear to interpret me as saying "Everyone should be calling it AI. Stop calling it something else." That really wasn't my intention. If you want to use more accurate language in your conversations, go ahead!  What I'm asking for here is that people try to resist the temptation to jump in to every AI discussion with "well actually, AI is a bad name for it because...", in place of more productive conversations. 
 Academia really did go all-in on Artificial Intelligence, across many decades. The Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab (SAIL) was founded by John McCarthy (who coined the term for the Dartmouth workshop) in 1963. The University of Texas Laboratory for Artificial Intelligence opened in 1983. Bernard Meltzer at the University of Edinburgh founded the Artificial Intelligence Journal in 1970. 
 Industry has behaved slightly differently. Just 5-10 years ago my experience was that people building with these technologies tended to avoid the term "AI", instead talking about "machine learning" or "deep learning". That's changed in the past few years, as the rise of LLMs and generative AI have produced systems that feel a little bit closer to the sci-fi version. 
 The term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter">AI winter</a> was coined in 1984 to describe a period of reduced funding for AI research. There have been two major winters so far, and people are already predicting a third. 
 The most influential organizations building Large Language Models today are <a href="https://openai.com/">OpenAI</a>, <a href="https://mistral.ai/">Mistral AI</a>, <a href="https://ai.meta.com/">Meta AI</a>, <a href="https://ai.google/">Google AI</a> and <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/">Anthropic</a>. All but Anthropic have AI in the title; Anthropic call themselves "an AI safety and research company". Could rejecting the term "AI" be synonymous with a disbelief in the value or integrity of this whole space? 
 One of the problems with saying "it's not actually intelligent" is that it raises the question of what intelligence truly is, and what capabilities a system would need in order to match that definition. This is a rabbit hole which I think can only act as a distraction from discussing the concrete problems with the systems we have today. 
 <p>Juan Luis <a href="https://social.juanlu.space/@astrojuanlu/111714012496518004">pointed me</a> to this fascinating little snippet tucked away in the references section on Wikipedia's <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence">History of Artificial Intelligence</a>, quoting John McCarthy in 1988:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[O]ne of the reasons for inventing the term "artificial intelligence" was to escape association with "cybernetics". Its concentration on analog feedback seemed misguided, and I wished to avoid having either to accept Norbert (not Robert) Wiener as a guru or having to argue with him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So part of the reason he coined the term AI was kind of petty! This is also a neat excuse for me to link to one of my favourite podcast episodes, 99% Invisible on <a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/project-cybersyn/">Project Cybersyn</a> (only tangentially related but it's so good!)</p>
 
 Jim Gardner <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@jimgar/111714306458200053">pointed out</a> that the term AI "is <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/polysemous">polysemic</a>. It means X to researchers, but Y to laypeople who only know of ChatGPT". I think this observation may be crucial to understanding why this topic is so hotly debated! 
 Aside from confusion with science-fiction, one of the strongest reasons for people to reject the term AI is due to its association with marketing and hype. Slapping the label "AI" on something is seen as a cheap trick that any company can use to attract attention and raise money, to the point that some people have a visceral aversion to the term. 
 
<p>Here's what Glyph Lefkowitz <a href="https://mastodon.social/@glyph/111712677063589054">had to say</a> about this last point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A lot of insiders—not practitioners as such, but marketers &amp; executives—use "AI" as the label not in spite of its confusion with the layperson's definition, but because of it. Investors who vaguely associate it with machine-god hegemony assume that it will be very profitable. Users assume it will solve their problems. It's a term whose primary purpose has become deceptive.</p>
<p>At the same time, a lot of the deception is unintentional. When you exist in a sector of the industry that the public knows as "AI", that the media calls "AI", that industry publications refer to as "AI", that other products identify as "AI", going out on a limb and trying to build a brand identity around pedantic hairsplitting around "LLMs" and "machine learning" is a massive uphill battle which you are disincentivized at every possible turn to avoid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Glyph's closing thought here reflects my own experience: I tried to avoid leaning too hard into the term "AI" myself, but eventually it felt like an uphill battle that was resulting in little to no positive impact.</p>

   Microsoft Research relicense Phi-2 as MIT 
 Phi-2 was already an interesting model - really strong results for its size - made available under a non-commercial research license. It just got significantly more interesting: Microsoft relicensed it as MIT open source.

<p>Prompt injection gets two whole sections, one on direct prompt injection (which incorporates jailbreaking as well, which they misclassify as a subset of prompt injection) and one on indirect prompt injection.</p>

<p>They talk a little bit about mitigations, but for both classes of attack conclude: "Unfortunately, there is no comprehensive or foolproof solution for protecting models against adversarial prompting, and future work will need to be dedicated to investigating suggested defenses for their efficacy."</p>

<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/projectvrm/EmanciPay"></a>How Microsoft Bing Image Creator illustrates EmanciPay
<p>Back when I was on the board of my regional Red Cross chapter (<a href="https://www.redcross.org/local/california/northern-california-coastal.html">this one</a>), I learned four lessons about fund raising:</p>
 
 People are glad to pay value for value. 
 People are most willing to pay when they perceive and appreciate the value they get from a product or service. 
 People are also most willing to pay full value when the need or opportunity to pay is immediate, and the amount they pay is up to them. 
 People are willing to pay more when they have a relationship with the other party (seller, service provider, philanthropy, cause, whatever) 
 
<p>It’s worth (value for value) digging down on the fourth point. Here’s what I wrote about it in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cluetrain-Manifesto-10th-Anniversary/dp/0465024092">The Cluetrain Manifesto (10th anniversary edition)</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Not long after Cluetrain came out in early 2000, I found myself on a cross-country flight, sitting beside a Nigerian pastor named Sayo Ajiboye. After we began to talk, it became clear to me that Sayo (pronounced “Shaiyo”) was a deeply wise man. Among his accomplishments was translating the highly annotated Thompson Bible into his native Yoruba language: a project that took eight of his thirty-nine years.</p>
<p>I told him that I had been involved in a far more modest book project—The Cluetrain Manifesto—and was traveling the speaking circuit, promoting it. When Sayo asked me what the book was about, I explained how “markets are conversations” was the first of our ninety-five theses, and how we had unpacked it in a chapter by that title. Sayo listened thoughtfully, then came back with the same response I had heard from other readers in what back then was still called the Third World: “Markets are conversations” is a pretty smart thing for well-off guys from the First World to be talking about. But it doesn’t go far enough.</p>
<p>When I asked him why, he told me to imagine we were in a “natural” marketplace—a real one in, say, an African village where one’s “brand” was a matter personal reputation, and where nobody ruled customer choices with a pricing gun. Then he picked up one of those blue airline pillows and told me to imagine it was a garment, such as a coat, and that I was interested in buying it. “What’s the first thing you would say to the seller?” he asked.</p>
<p>“What does it cost?”</p>
<p>“Yes, you would say that,” he replied, meaning that this was typical of a First World shopper for whom price is the primary concern. Then he asked me to imagine that a conversation follows between the seller and me—that the two of us get to know each other a bit and learn from each other. “Now,” he asked, “What happens to the price?”<br>
I said maybe now I’m willing to pay more while the seller is willing to charge less.</p>
<p>“Why?” Sayo asked.</p>
<p>I didn’t have an answer.</p>
<p>“Because you now have a relationship,” he said.</p>
<p>As we continued talking, it became clear to me that everything that happens in a marketplace falls into just three categories: transaction, conversation, and relationship. In our First World business culture, transaction matters most, conversation less, and relationship least. Worse, we conceive and justify everything in transactional terms. Nothing matters more than price and “the bottom line.” By looking at markets through the prism of transaction or even conversation, we miss the importance of relationship. We also don’t see how relationship has a value all its own: one that transcends, even as it improves, the other two.</p>
<p>Consider your relationship with friends and family, Sayo said. The value system there is based on caring and generosity, not on price. Balance and reciprocity may play in a relationship, but are not the basis of it. One does not make deals for love. There are other words for that.</p>
<p>Back in the industrialized world, few of our market relationships run so deep, nor should they. By necessity much of our relating is shallow and temporary. We don’t want to get personal with an ATM machine or even with real bank tellers. Friendly is nice, but in most business situations that’s about as far as we want to go.</p>
<p>But relationship is a broad category: broad enough to contain all forms of relating—the shallow as well as the deep, the temporary as well as the enduring. In the business culture of the industrialized world, Sayo said, we barely understand relationship’s full meaning or potential. And we should. Doing so would be good for business.</p>
<p>So he told me our next assignment was to unpack and study another thesis: Markets are relationships.</p></blockquote>
<p>That is why, six years after the first edition of Cluetrain came out, I started <a href="https://projectvrm.org">ProjectVRM</a> (the R means Relationship) at the <a href="http://cyber.harvard.edu">Berkman Klein Center,</a> wrote <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Intention-Economy-When-Customers-Charge/dp/1422158527">The Intention Economy: When Customers Take Charge</a>, (Harvard Business Review Press, 2012), co-founded <a href="http://customercommons.org">Customer Commons</a> (in 2013), and am now a visiting scholar with the <a href="https://ostromworkshop.indiana.edu/">Ostrom Workshop</a> at Indiana University, thinking out loud about how a <a href="https://doc.searls.com/news-commons/">news commons</a> might thrive as a market of relationships—starting here in Bloomington, IU’s home town.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2024/01/04/the-news-business/">The News Business</a> (which precedes this post), I said the three current business models for local news were advertising, subscription, and philanthropy, and promised a fourth. This is it: emancipayments.</p>
<p>We* came up with this idea in 2009. Here is how the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/projectvrm/EmanciPay">EmanciPay page</a> on the ProjectVRM wiki puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
 Overview 
<p>Simply put, Emancipay makes it easy for anybody to pay (or offer to pay) —</p>
 
 as much as they like 
 however they like 
 for whatever they like 
 on their own terms 
 
<p>— or at least to start with that full set of options, and to work out differences with sellers easily and with minimal friction.</p>
<p>Emancipay turns consumers (aka users) into customers by giving them a pricing gun (something which in the past only sellers used) and their own means to make offers, to pay outright, and to escrow the intention to pay when price and other requirements are met. And to be able to do this at scale across all sellers, much as cash, browsers, credit cards and email clients do the same. Payments themselves can also be escrowed.</p>
<p>In slightly more technical terms, EmanciPay is a payment framework for customers operating with full agency in the open marketplace, and at scale. It operates on open protocols and standards, so it can be used by any buyer, seller or intermediary.</p>
<p>It was conceived as a way to pay for music, journalism, or what any artist brings into the world. But it can apply to anything. For example, [<a href="https://customercommons.org/solving-subscriptions/">subscriptions</a>], which have become by 2021 a giant fecosystem in which every seller has separate and non-substitutable scale across all subscribers, while subscribers have zero scale across all sellers, with the highly conditional exceptions of silo’d commercial intermediaries. As [<a href="http://customercommons.org/">Customer Commons</a>] puts it,</p>
<p>There’s also not much help coming from the subscription management services we have on our side: Truebill, Bobby, Money Dashboard, Mint, Subscript Me, BillTracker Pro, Trim, Subby, Card Due, Sift, SubMan, and Subscript Me. Nor from the subscription management systems offered by Paypal, Amazon, Apple or Google (e.g. with Google Sheets and Google Doc templates). All of them are too narrow, too closed and exclusive, too exposed to the surveillance imperatives of corporate giants, and too vested in the status quo.</p>
<p>That status quo sucks (see&nbsp;<a href="https://enewspaper.latimes.com/infinity/article_share.aspx?guid=b8db8d9f-5e61-4da2-b112-e5e1cf71df57">here</a>, or just look up&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=subscription+hell">“subscription hell”</a>), and it’s way past time to unscrew it.) But how?</p>
<p>The better question is&nbsp;where?</p>
<p>The answer to that is&nbsp;on our side: the customer’s side.</p>
<p>While EmanciPay was first conceived by ProjectVRM as a way to make live payments to nonprofits and to provide&nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/vrm/2009/05/28/emancipay-a-content-monetization-plan-for-newspapers/">a new monetization method for publishers</a>. it also works as a counterpart to sellers’ subscription systems in what&nbsp;<a href="http://www.zuora.com/">Zuora</a>&nbsp;(a supplier of subscription management systems to the publishing industry, including&nbsp;The Guardian&nbsp;and&nbsp;Financial Times) calls the “<a href="http://www.zuora.com/subscription-economy/">subscription economy</a>“, which it says “is built on ever changing relationships with your customers”. Since relationships are two-way by nature, EmanciPay is one way that customers can manage their end, while publisher-side systems such as Zuora’s manage the other.</p>
 EmanciPay economic case 
<p>EmanciPay provides a new form of economic signaling not available to individuals, either on the Net or before the Net became available as a communications medium. EmanciPay will use open standards and be comprised of open source code. While any commercial [Fourth party] can use EmanciPay (or its principles, or any parts of it they like), EmanciPay’s open and standard framework will support fourth parties by making them substitutable, much as the open standards of email (smtp, pop3, imap) make email systems substitutable. (Each has what&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.joeandrieu.com/2009/04/26/introducing-user-driven-services/">Joe Andrieu calls</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.joeandrieu.com/2009/05/07/user-driven-services-5-service-endpoint-portability/">service endpoint portability</a>.)</p>
<p>EmanciPay is an instrument of customer independence from all of the billion (or so) commercial entities on the Net, each with its own arcane and silo’d systems for engaging and managing customer relations, as well as receipt, acknowledgement and accounting for payments from customers.</p>
 Use Case Background 
<p>EmanciPay was conceived originally as a way to provide a customers with the means to signal interest and ability to pay for media and creative works (most of which are freely available on the Web, if not always free of charge). Through EmanciPay, demand and supply can relate, converse and transact business on mutually beneficial terms, rather than only on terms provided by the countless different silo’d systems we have today, each serving to hold the customer captive, and causing much inconvenience and friction in the process.</p>
<p>Media goods were chosen for five reasons:</p>
 
 because most are available for free, even if they cost money, or are behind paywalls 
 paywalls, which are cookie-based, cannot relate to individuals as anything other than submissive and dependent parties (and each browser a users employs carries a different set of cookies) 
 both media companies and non-profits are constantly looking for new sources of revenue 
 the subscription model, while it creates steady income and other conveniences for sellers, is often a bad deal for customers, and is now so overused (see <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2022/07/15/subscriptification/">Subscriptification</a>) that the world is approaching a peak subscription crisis, and&nbsp;<a href="https://reality2.substack.com/p/unscrewing-subscriptions">unscrewing it can only happen from the customer’s side (because the business is incapable of unscrewing the problem itself</a> 
 all methods of intermediating payment choices are either silo’d by the seller or silo’d by intermediators, discouraging participation by individuals. 
 
<p>What the marketplace requires are new business and social contracts that ease payment and stigmatize non-payment for creative goods. The friction involved in voluntary payment is still high, even on the Web, where one must go through complex ceremonies even to make simple payments.&nbsp; There is no common and easy way either to keep track of what media (free or otherwise) we use (see <a title="Media Logging" href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/projectvrm/Media_Logging">Media Logging</a>), to determine what it might be worth, and to pay for it easily and in standard ways &amp;#151; to many different suppliers. (Again, each supplier has its own system for accepting payments.)</p>
<p>EmanciPay differs from other payment models (subscriptions, newsstand, tip jars) by providing customers with the ability to choose what they wish to pay and how they’ll pay it, with minimum friction — and with full choice about what they disclose about themselves.</p>
<p>EmanciPay will also support credit for referrals, requests for service, feedback and other relationship support mechanisms, all at the control of the user. For example, EmanciPay can provide quick and easy ways for listeners to pay for public radio broadcasts or podcasts, for readers to pay for otherwise “free” papers or blogs, for listeners to pay to hear music and support artists, for users to issue promises of payment for for stories or programs — all without requiring the individual to disclose unnecessary private information, or to become a “member” — although these options are kept open.</p>
<p>This will scaffold genuine relationships between buyers and sellers in the media marketplace. It will also give deeper meaning to “membership” in non-profits. (Under the current system, “membership” generally means putting one’s name on a pitch list for future contributions, and not much more than that.)</p>
<p>EmanciPay will also connect the sellers’ CRM (Customer Relationship Management) systems with customers’ VRM (Vendor Relationship Management) systems, supporting rich and participatory two-way relationships. In fact, EmanciPay will by definition be a VRM system.</p>
 Micro-accounting 
<p>The idea of&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micropayment">“micro-payments”</a>&nbsp;for goods on the Net has been around for a long time, and if often brought up as a potential business model for journalism by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1877191,00.html">an article by Walter Isaacson</a>&nbsp;in Time Magazine. What ProjectVRM&nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/vrm/2009/02/11/emancipay/">suggests instead</a>&nbsp;is something we don’t yet have, but very much need:&nbsp;micro-accounting&nbsp;for actual uses. These including reading, listening and watching.</p>
<p>Most of what we now call “content” is both free for the taking and worth more than $zero. How much more? We need to be able to say. In economic terms, demand needs to have a much wider range of signals it can give to supply.</p>
<p>So, as currently planned, EmanciPay would —</p>
 
 Provide a single and easy way that consumers of “content” can become customers of it. In the current system — which isn’t one — every artist, every musical group, every public radio and TV station, has his, her or its own way of taking in contributions from those who appreciate the work. This can be arduous and time-consuming for everybody involved. (Imagine trying to pay separately every musical artist you like, for all your enjoyment of each artists work.) What EmanciPay proposes, however, is not a replacement for existing systems, but a new system that can supplement existing fund-raising systems — one that can soak up much of today’s MLOTT: Money Left On The Table. 
 Provide ways for individuals to look back through their media usage histories, inform themselves about what they have been enjoying, and to determine how much it is worth to them. The Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel (CARP), and later the Copyright Royalty Board (CRB), both came up with “rates and terms that would have been negotiated in the marketplace between a willing buyer and a willing seller” — language that first appeared in the 1995 Digital Performance Royalty Act (DPRA), and was tweaked in 1998 by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), under which both the CARP and the CRB operated. The rates they came up with peaked at $.0001 per “performance” (a song or recording), per listener. EmanciPay creates the “willing buyer” that the DPRA thought wouldn’t exist. 
 Stigmatize non-payment for worthwhile media goods. This is where “social” will finally come to be something more than yet another tech buzzmodifier. 
 
<p>All these require micro-accounting, not micro-payments. In fact micro-accounting can inform ordinary payments that can be made in clever new ways that should satisfy everybody with an interest in seeing artists compensated fairly for their work. An individual listener, for example, can say “I want to pay 1¢ for every song I hear on the radio,” and “I’ll send&nbsp;<a href="http://www.soundexchange.com/">SoundExchange</a>&nbsp;a lump sum of all the pennies wish to pay for songs I hear over the course of a year, along with an accounting of what artists and songs I’ve listened to” — and leave dispersal of those totaled pennies up to the kind of agency that likes, and can be trusted, to do that kind of thing.</p>
<p>Similar systems can also be put in place for readers of newspapers, blogs and other journals. What’s important is that the control is in the hands of the individual, and that the accounting and dispersal systems work the same way for everybody.</p></blockquote>
<p>I visited EmanciPay use cases twice in Linux Journal:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/easy-way-pay-journalism-music-and-everything-else-we">An Easy Way to Pay for Journalism, Music and Everything Else We Like</a> (May 2015) 
 <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/immodest-proposal-music-industry">An Immodest Proposal for the Music Industry</a> (November 2018) 
 
<p>There are two differences in the world today that should make it easier to code up something like EmanciPay:</p>
 
 Smartphones and apps on them have become extensions of ourselves. 
 AI. 
 
<p>For the latter, I am not talking about the kind of centralized AI we get from Amazon, Microsoft/OpenAI, Adobe, and the rest. I’m talking about AI that’s as personal as our own underwear and gives us what Sam Altman calls “<a href="https://projectvrm.org/2023/11/11/individual-empowerment-and-agency-on-a-scale-weve-never-seen-before/">individual empowerment and agency on a scale we’ve never seen before</a>.” That quote became the title of the post I wrote at that link. I will unpack it further in an upcoming News Commons post.</p>
<p>But first I’ll dig deeper into what we need to develop EmanciPay, and how we can use it to scaffold up the kind of markets first imagined by <a href="http://cluetrain.com">The Cluetrain Manifesto</a>, a quarter century ago.</p>

 <p><br></p><p></p><p>Hierarchy appears to be the only option to pull a large group of individuals together toward a common goal. Many insects did it well before humans, but over the last 10,0000 years, humans have moved from decentralised clans into centralised nation-states consisting of hundreds of millions of people.&nbsp; From the pharaohs to Max Weber’s 20th bureaucratic management structure, we can now exist only in such a system because as a society or organisation grows beyond a few dozen people, the hierarchical pyramid is seen as the only option for the organisation.&nbsp; The justification is that it is nature and natural.&nbsp;</p><p>The “ideal organisation” was defined by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Weber">Max Weber</a> as a clear and strong hierarchy underpinned by the division of tasks based on specialisation. A fundamental assumption was that each unit takes care of one piece of the chain and the division of tasks within the unit is clearly defined, work can be executed much more efficiently. Weber envisioned this as a “superior structure” because it focused on rationality and equal treatment of all - assuming everyone was happy with their 1984 dystopian jobs and oversight. By formalising processes within organisations, but especially in government, favouritism and abuse of power could be prevented - as he assumed that those in charge and specialised workers remained. A really poor underlying assumption was that people act rationally, efficiently, and professionally.&nbsp; He also ignored the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder_primacy">shareholder primacy</a> that would emerge.&nbsp; However, so strong is the argument that it remains the leading business philosophy today, and we still teach that hierarchy, administration and bureaucracy driven by efficiency and effective thinking underpinned by a better division of tasks and responsibilities to drive organisational performance measurable objective is still best practice. The justification is that it represents nature and is natural.&nbsp;</p><p>Different models emerged from the internet, web, and digital thinking allowing us to ponder if something better is possible. Small iterations, such as matrix management, never really changed the fundamentals and whilst embracing all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_theory">stakeholders </a>and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental,_social,_and_corporate_governance">ESG</a> has added complexity to the decisions and models - hierarchy remains. However, it is possible to sense in the noise signals that “Data” is finally about to disrupt and dislodge a love/ hate affair with hierarchy, power, and control.&nbsp;</p><p>Counter to this and according to both scientists, individuals, including leaders, do not make their decisions after a thorough analysis, but first decide, unconsciously and intuitively, and then rationalise their decision. We have become experts in seeking out framed and biased data to justify and provide a rational argument for a decision we have already made.</p><p>-----</p><p>Endless inches have been written about structure, who and how to lead and what a digital organisation looks like. However, right now, we are likely to be in the death phase for a pure CDO (chief data/ digital officer) role as it becomes clear that the CTO, CIO and CDO roles have very similar mandates and are now actually competing for power, resources and a clear value to the organisation. The ridged ideals of separation and specialism models driving structures, management, incentives, KPI’s and hierarchy cannot work with the emergence of highly complex interdependency in a digital age - are we witnessing that the division of labour falls apart at scale because of complexity and speed?&nbsp;</p><p>For a complicated task, the separation of that task into modules, and components to create the scale of efficiency and effectiveness works, and it works really well. For any task where the output directly and immediately, because of close feedback loops, changes the inputs for the next unit of creation and consumption - the hierarchy fails.&nbsp; The ridged division of labour into separate tasks, modules, parts or components does not work - because it fundamentally needs repeatability.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When operating at speed and scale - but there is a high level of repeatability, hierarchy delivers, and we know its problems.&nbsp; However, data is enabling us to operate at speed, scale and uniqueness (non-repeatability) - this is different.&nbsp;</p><p>However, data is enabling us to operate at speed, scale and uniqueness (non-repeatability) - this is different.&nbsp;</p><p>---</p><p>We have recognised for a while that leadership/ chief roles are actually a representation of the ontology of an organisation (structure), the question has never been if you need a CEO, CFO, CMO, CTO as these were clearly delineated roles and specialisms.&nbsp; We understand the roles, mandates, powers and delegated authority the experts and leaders bring and have.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In a digital business, we have created four roles CTO, CIO, CDO and CISO. But the reality is that the CMO and CDO need the CFO’s data. The CFO wants the COO and CMO’s data. The CIO has lots of data but no direct path to showing value. The CISO needs other data from outside the organisation and the CTO needs data the CMO has not yet imagined. Organisations opted to create new roles such as Chief Data or Digital Officer to address the emerging complexity and to avoid too much power being vested in the CTO.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Breaking the axis of old - the CEO/ CFO</p><p>The CEO/CFO axis has this framing; we’ll do more things that are cheaper in the short term and less of those that are more expensive in the long term as our incentive and remuneration guide us.&nbsp; In a company with unified incentives, there is a uniciation of framing which means it is difficult for new ideas to emerge.&nbsp; This incentive friction or incentive dependency means we always face the same decisions in the same way.</p><p>Many leaders are realising that data is forging changes, and this change is not about tech, data or analysis, but it is about whether we, the leadership, exec or board, are making the right decisions.&nbsp; Decisions of the past were framed by the ideal hierarchy underpinned by efficiency and effectiveness at scale driven by the demands for specialisation. However, to know we are making the right decision going forward, we need to understand we have the right choices today, which means we need all “data” and our data can no longer be about isolation, separation or specialisation.&nbsp;</p><p>I expect that we are about to see a new axis of power arrive with the emergence of a new chief role as we realise, we need a new power dynamic structure.&nbsp; A two-way axis (CEO/CFO) becomes a three-way stool.&nbsp; The emergence of the CEO/ CFO/ CxO. The CEO/ CFO will maintain the remits of controlling and understanding the speed and scale at which the hierarchy operates,&nbsp; with the new role focussing on uniqueness - how data breaks the old hierarchy. &nbsp; It does not matter what you call the X, the point is what is their mandate.&nbsp; They have to own:&nbsp;</p>  <p>the data philosophy</p>  <p>all data emerging from the company and its ecosystem&nbsp;</p>  <p>data governance and security</p>  <p>direct the current and future platform's abilities, functionality and performance</p>  <p>The point here is that this role is not about the analysis of the data but about ensuring the quality, attestation, providence, provenance, function, form, taxonomy, ontology and pedagogy of the data needed for decision and that we will continue to access to and enjoy the data we need to make better decisions.</p><p>The critical point is that once the CEO/CFO could know if they were making the right decisions as the framing they needed was about efficiency and effectiveness within a specialism model, however going forward, this axis is not only insufficient, it is damaging. This new third member is needed to provide modern-day stabilisation and governance to ensure that as an expanded team, “we know we are making the right decisions”, as we must regularly ask efficacy questions that were not needed under the old repeatability model, as the mission was sufficient as the guide.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The first victim will be the CDO, as it exists in a specialisation-driven hierarchy that has no choice but to change - not its structure and how it thinks.&nbsp;</p><br><br><br><br>

<p></p>
<p>What do these say about the news business? Well,</p>
 
 It’s mostly male. 
 It’s mostly about newspapers, somewhat about TV, and idealized both. 
 It used to be big. 
 It doesn’t know what to make of the Internet. 
 It’s obsolete in the extreme. 
 
<p>For most of the prior century, the news business was big. In tech parlance, it scaled. Here in the U.S. and Canada, every town had a newspaper, and in some cases several. Many towns—and all cities—had radio stations. Every name-brand city had a TV station, or two, or more. The great newsweeklies, Time and Newsweek, had millions of subscribers and made lots of money. So did TV network news operations. Newsstands were everywhere.</p>
<p>All of that has collapsed. Some print and broadcast news operations still exist, but most are shells of their former selves, and many put news icing on a cake of partisan talk shows. Exceptions to collapse are the surviving news giants (New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal), and resourceful public broadcasters. (<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/fact-sheet/public-broadcasting/">Pew Research shows</a> NPR’s audience has long topped 20 million people, though it is slowly declining.)</p>
<p>People today get most of their news through phones, tablets, and laptops. These are packed with apps that maximize optionality. People now hardly listen, watch, or read on schedules set by publishers, stations, or networks. Everyone with a smartphone had a limitless variety of news sources. Or sources within sources such as Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and old-fashioned social media such as Facebook and X.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/11/15/more-americans-are-getting-news-on-tiktok-bucking-the-trend-seen-on-most-other-social-media-sites/">According to Pew</a>, the top news sources for young people today are TikTok and social media. In other words, from each other. The threshold of news creation and production is also low. This is why, <a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/number-of-podcasts#number-of-podcasts">according to Exploding Topics</a>, there are now over three million podcasts worldwide.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Galloway_(professor)">Scott Galloway</a> put it in a recent <a href="https://podcasts.voxmedia.com/show/pivot">Pivot</a> podcast (which I can’t find right now), news is a shitty business—at least if you want to scale up something huge. It’s not even a great small business. But hell, neither is running a restaurant, a nail salon, a clothing shop, or a small farm. But those are real businesses.</p>
<p>As Jeff Jarvis makes clear in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Gutenberg-Parenthesis-Print-Lessons-Internet/dp/1501394827">The Gutenberg Parenthesis: The Age of Print and Its Lessons for the Age of the Internet</a> (which I highly recommend), we are at the end of one long era and the start of another one.</p>
<p>In these early years of The Internet Age, the most substantive news and news businesses are the local kind. True, not everybody cares about local news. But everybody lives somewhere, and it does matter what goes on where people live. <a href="https://buzzmachine.com/2024/01/03/a-journalism-of-belief-and-belonging/">Belonging</a> somewhere in the virtual world is optional, but it is mandatory in the physical one. And, as with running a restaurant, a store, or a farm, reporting local news is a labor of talent and love. It’s what we still call “a living.”</p>
<p>Right now there are three models for the local news business: advertising, subscription, and philanthropy. In my <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2024/01/05/the-new-news-business/">next post</a>, the eighth in <a href="https://doc.searls.com/news-commons/">this series</a>, I’ll lay out the case for a fourth one.</p>
 
<p>*I didn’t try Midjourney, DALL-E 3, or Stable Diffusion because they all require subscriptions, and I don’t feel like paying for those yet. DALL-E 2 yielded blah results.</p>

 Inspired by the tag cloud I used in my recent 2023 AI roundup post, I decided to add a tag cloud to the top of every one of my archive-by-year pages showing what topics I had spent the most time with that year. 

 I already had old code for this, so I pasted it into GPT-4 along with an example of the output of my JSON endpoint from Django SQL Dash

<p></p><p>I don’t want to call these the&nbsp;best books I read last year: I read plenty of other well-written, worthy contenders. But these six titles are the ones that stuck with me and left me thinking about them long after I was done; they were, in that sense, my favorites. Maybe you’ll enjoy them too.</p> <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/7949/9780374279271">Readme.Txt: A Memoir, by Chelsea Manning</a> <p>This memoir is one of those historical documents that reveal so much about their era, both in its supertext and in small details that are in themselves revealing. As well as the story of her leaks and their aftermath, Chelsea discusses what it’s like to work in military intelligence in gut-wrenching detail.</p><p>Regardless of your opinion of her actions (she’s one of my heroes), this is an important and uncompromisingly personal record of our era.</p> <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/7949/9780063072657">How High We Go in the Dark, by Sequoia Nagamatsu</a> <p>This ostensibly science fiction novel is not what I thought it was going to be. An early chapter was so heartbreaking that I thought I would have to abandon the book; it brought up feelings of loss I hadn’t felt since my mother died.</p><p>I still don’t know if I appreciate the catharsis, but that’s what this book is: the author conjures how deeply we feel in the face of the worst horrors. It’s poetry, in a way, using science fiction as a particular kind of lens. Artful and devastating.</p> <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/7949/9780374610326">Doppelganger: A Trip Into the Mirror World, by Naomi Klein</a> <p>A riveting analysis of the late-stage internet era, using the parallel paths of Naomis Klein and Wolf as a device to examine the multiple realities we've constructed for ourselves.</p><p>I particularly agree with a conclusion that pulls no punches about how to correct our paths and potentially save ourselves.</p> <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/7949/9781250214997">Severance, by Ling Ma</a> <p>I loved this story about loss, meaning, and what it means to be an immigrant, dressed up as a science fiction novel. As with ‌ How High We Go in the Dark, this is my favorite kind of science fiction: speculation as metaphor in order to talk about something far more human.</p><p>But the science fiction is good too, and alarmingly close to the real-life global pandemic that took place a few years after it was written. This is a book about disconnection; its resonance goes far beyond its original meaning.</p> <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/7949/9780593321201">Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, by Gabrielle Zevin</a> <p>I know, I know — it’s on just about everybody’s list.</p><p>But this beautiful novel about work, friendship, love, and identity deserves it. I suppose it's about video games too, but not really; it could just as easily be about any creative act.</p><p>I loved Zevin's writing, the melancholy through line, and the characterizations (although they've been maligned in some reviews). For me, the work is only diminished by the knowledge that she used concepts from some real-world games (e.g., Train) without credit. Ultimately it’s tangential to the meaning of the work, but it would have been so easy to fix.</p> <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/7949/9781735016528">Foundry, by Eliot Peper</a> <p>A knockabout spy adventure that takes a few unexpected turns and sticks a landing that had me cheering.</p><p>It’s truly a lot of fun - I inhaled it in one sitting. It's also deeply researched, in a way where the detail only ever adds to the entertainment. (Without spoiling anything, I'm very familiar with some of the settings and cultural overtones, and they rang completely true.)</p><p>There are knowing callbacks to some of Eliot's earlier work (he’s clearly building a world across his novels), but this stands alone, and could be the start of a new series that I would gladly read the hell out of.</p>

<p>This article shows how to secure a Blazor Server application. The application implements an OpenID Connect confidential client with PKCE using .NET 8 and configures the security headers as best possible for the Blazor Server application. OpenIddict is used to implement the identity provider and the OpenID Connect server.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/BlazorServerOidc">https://github.com/damienbod/BlazorServerOidc</a></p>







<p></p>



 OpenID Connect flow 



<p>In the first step, the authentication can be solved using OpenID Connect. With this, the process of user authentication is removed from the client application and delegated to an identity provider. In this demo, <a href="https://github.com/openiddict/openiddict-core">OpenIddict </a>is used. The <a href="https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/">OpenID Connect</a> code flow with PKCE is used and the application uses a client secret to authenticate. This can be further improved by using a certificate and client assertions when using the  code from the OpenID Connect flow to request the tokens. The flow can also be improved to use OAuth 2.0 Pushed Authorization Requests <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9126">PAR</a>, if the identity provider supports this. </p>



<p>In ASP.NET Core or Blazor, this can be implemented using the Microsoft ASP.NET Core OpenIdConnect package.</p>



 
 Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect 
 



<p>The authentication flow requires some service setup as well as middleware changes in the pipelines. The solution uses the OpenID Connect scheme to take care of the user authentication and saves this in a cookie. The name claim is set to use the “name” claim. This is different with every identity provider and also depending how the ASP.NET Core application maps this. All razor page requests must be authenticated unless otherwise specified.</p>


  builder.Services.AddAuthentication(options =&gt;
{
  options.DefaultScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
  options.DefaultChallengeScheme = OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
})
.AddCookie()
.AddOpenIdConnect(options =&gt;
{
  builder.Configuration.GetSection("OpenIDConnectSettings").Bind(options);

  options.SignInScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
  options.ResponseType = OpenIdConnectResponseType.Code;

  options.SaveTokens = true;
  options.GetClaimsFromUserInfoEndpoint = true;
  options.TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
  {
	  NameClaimType = "name"
  };
});

builder.Services.AddRazorPages().AddMvcOptions(options =&gt;
{
  var policy = new AuthorizationPolicyBuilder()
	  .RequireAuthenticatedUser()
	  .Build();
  options.Filters.Add(new AuthorizeFilter(policy));
});

builder.Services.AddControllersWithViews(options =&gt;
    options.Filters.Add(new AutoValidateAntiforgeryTokenAttribute()));
  


<p>The application pipeline is setup after the services are built. ASP.NET Core adds some automatic claim mapping and renames some claims per default. This can be reset to use the exact claims sent back from the identity provider. </p>


  var app = builder.Build();

JsonWebTokenHandler.DefaultInboundClaimTypeMap.Clear();

if (!app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.UseExceptionHandler("/Error");
    app.UseHsts();
}

app.UseSecurityHeaders(
    SecurityHeadersDefinitions.GetHeaderPolicyCollection(
        app.Environment.IsDevelopment(),
        app.Configuration["OpenIDConnectSettings:Authority"]));

app.UseHttpsRedirection();

app.UseStaticFiles();

app.UseRouting();

app.UseAuthentication();
app.UseAuthorization();

app.MapRazorPages();
app.MapControllers();

app.MapBlazorHub().RequireAuthorization();
app.MapFallbackToPage("/_Host");

app.Run();
  


 CascadingAuthenticationState 



<p>The CascadingAuthenticationState is used to force and share the authentication requirements in the UI and the Blazor Server components. If the application and the user are not authenticated and authorized, the user is redirected to the identity provider.</p>


  @inject NavigationManager NavigationManager

&lt;CascadingAuthenticationState&gt;
    &lt;Router AppAssembly="@typeof(App).Assembly"&gt;
        &lt;Found Context="routeData"&gt;
            &lt;AuthorizeRouteView RouteData="@routeData" DefaultLayout="@typeof(MainLayout)"&gt;
                &lt;NotAuthorized&gt;
                    @{
                        var returnUrl = NavigationManager.ToBaseRelativePath(NavigationManager.Uri);
                        NavigationManager.NavigateTo($"api/account/login?redirectUri={returnUrl}", forceLoad: true);
                    }
                &lt;/NotAuthorized&gt;
                &lt;Authorizing&gt;
                    Wait...
                &lt;/Authorizing&gt;
            &lt;/AuthorizeRouteView&gt;
        &lt;/Found&gt;
        &lt;NotFound&gt;
            &lt;LayoutView Layout="@typeof(MainLayout)"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Sorry, there's nothing at this address.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/LayoutView&gt;
        &lt;/NotFound&gt;
    &lt;/Router&gt;
&lt;/CascadingAuthenticationState&gt;
  


<p></p>



 Authentication flow UI Pages 



<p>The menu needs to display the login or the logout buttons depends on the state of the application. Blazor provides an AuthorizeView component for this. This can be used in the UI to hide or show elements depending on the authenticate state.</p>


  &lt;AuthorizeView&gt;
    &lt;Authorized&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;@context.User.Identity?.Name&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;form action="api/account/logout" method="post"&gt;
            &lt;button type="submit" class="nav-link btn btn-link text-dark"&gt;
                 Logout 
            &lt;/button&gt;
        &lt;/form&gt;
    &lt;/Authorized&gt;
    &lt;NotAuthorized&gt;
        &lt;a href="api/account/login?redirectUri=/"&gt;Log in&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/NotAuthorized&gt;
&lt;/AuthorizeView&gt;
  


<p>I added a log in, log out in an account controller and signed out Razor page to handle the authentication requests from the UI. The application automatically authenticates so the login is only used in the signed out page. The login removes the authenticated user from both schemes; the cookie and the OpenID Connect scheme. To remove the authenticated user from the identity provider, the application needs to redirect. This cannot be implemented in an ajax request.</p>


  [IgnoreAntiforgeryToken] // need to apply this to the form post request
[Authorize]
[HttpPost("Logout")]
public IActionResult Logout()
{
    return SignOut(
        new AuthenticationProperties { RedirectUri = "/SignedOut" },
        CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,
        OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme);
}
  


<p>The SignedOut is the only unauthorized page, component in the application. The AllowAnonymous is used for this. </p>


  using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RazorPages;

namespace BlazorServerOidc.Pages;

[AllowAnonymous]
public class SignedOutModel : PageModel
{
    public void OnGet() { }
}
  


<p></p>



 Security headers 



<p>The user is authenticated. The application need to protect the session as well. I use NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders for this. </p>



 
 NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders 



 NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders.TagHelpers 
 



<p>Blazor Server is a severed rendered application with UI components. The application can implement nonce based CSP. All the typical security headers are added as best possible for this technology.</p>


  namespace BlazorServerOidc;

public static class SecurityHeadersDefinitions
{
    public static HeaderPolicyCollection GetHeaderPolicyCollection(bool isDev, string? idpHost)
    {
        ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull(idpHost);

        var policy = new HeaderPolicyCollection()
            .AddFrameOptionsDeny()
            .AddContentTypeOptionsNoSniff()
            .AddReferrerPolicyStrictOriginWhenCrossOrigin()
            .AddCrossOriginOpenerPolicy(builder =&gt; builder.SameOrigin())
            .AddCrossOriginResourcePolicy(builder =&gt; builder.SameOrigin())
            .AddCrossOriginEmbedderPolicy(builder =&gt; builder.RequireCorp()) // remove for dev if using hot reload
            .AddContentSecurityPolicy(builder =&gt;
            {
                builder.AddObjectSrc().None();
                builder.AddBlockAllMixedContent();
                builder.AddImgSrc().Self().From("data:");
                builder.AddFormAction().Self().From(idpHost);
                builder.AddFontSrc().Self();        
                builder.AddBaseUri().Self();
                builder.AddFrameAncestors().None();

                builder.AddStyleSrc()
                    .UnsafeInline() 
                    .Self();

                builder.AddScriptSrc()
                    .WithNonce()
                    .UnsafeInline(); // only a fallback for older browsers when the nonce is used

                // disable script and style CSP protection if using Blazor hot reload
                // if using hot reload, DO NOT deploy with an insecure CSP
            })
            .RemoveServerHeader()

  I've joined the Standards Council of Canada's mirror committee for ISO SC 37 (Biometrics). My focus is on proving liveness and biometric matching for face and consumer-operated sensors. Excited to explore international interest at the upcoming January 2024 SC 37 plenary in Okayama.

<p>Another year, another ISO committee!  </p>



<p>I have joined the Standards Council of Canada mirror committee for SC 37 (Biometrics) and will be attending the international meetings. The hard work has begun learning the committee culture, personalities and flow of projects.</p>



<p>Getting started in an ISO committee involves applying for accreditation as a national standards body expert in the domain; connecting up to the wikis and email lists; attaching to the document management system; and locating the ‘active coal face’<a>1</a> – the precise status of each interesting project. Not trivial. It’s the same pattern for every standards body – getting caught up takes effort.</p>



<p>There are six work groups within SC 37. I’ll be spending most of my time in WG 5 (Biometric Testing and Reporting) and WG 4 (Technical Implementation of Biometric Systems). WG 1 (Harmonized Biometric Vocabulary), WG 2 (Biometric Technical Interfaces), WG 3 (Biometric Data Interchange Formats) and WG 6 (Cross-Jurisdictional and Societal Aspects of Biometrics) will receive attention as and when needed.</p>



<p>Here are some of the projects that look immediately interesting to me. My opinion will certainly change as I get into the work </p>



 
 ISO/IEC 30107-3 — Biometric presentation attack detection — Part 3: Testing and reporting 



 ISO/IEC 30107-4:2020 — Information technology — Biometric presentation attack detection — Part 4: Profile for testing of mobile devices 



 ISO/IEC TS 19795-9:2019 — Information technology — Biometric performance testing and reporting — Part 9: Testing on mobile devices 



 ISO/IEC 20059 — Vulnerability of Biometric Recognition Systems with Respect to Morphing Attacks 



 ISO/IEC 9868 — Remote biometric identification systems — Design, development, and audit 



 ISO/IEC 29794-5 — Face image quality assessment 



 ISO/IEC TR 22116:2021 — A study of the differential impact of demographic factors in biometric recognition system performance 



 ISO/IEC 19795-10 — Quantifying biometric system performance variation across demographic groups 



 ISO/IEC 39794-5:2019 — Information technology — Extensible biometric data interchange formats — Part 5: Face image data 
 



<p>One observation that I must confirm: SC 37 appears to be oriented to controlled-environment biometric systems: where the operator of the system controls the sensors, hardware and software. </p>



<p>I believe, for now, that there are additional design requirements for the exponential-growth bring-your-own biometric sensor (on your mobile device). And this aspect is very interesting to me. My company’s product does remote ID Proofing and Verification using biometric evaluation for linking, and biometric re-verification (aka “returning user authentication”). We construct 3D face models for proof of liveness and matching. We are concerned with proven liveness and end to end device/sensor security (for mobile devices cameras and webcams). </p>



<p>Performance testing, presentation attack detection/performance, mobile-first and face-first topics are hot now.</p>



<p>I’m about to find out the level of international interest and state of standardization in these areas during the SC 37 plenary at Okayama in January 2024 – wish me luck!. </p>



 


  Realizing that ‘active coal face’ is a dying idiom — but what is the climate-friendly replacement? Maybe the ‘code repo pull requests page’? I invite you to respond! <a>︎</a>

  <p>Ten years ago yesterday, Tom Scott <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5V45wYwrkY">posted this video</a> to YouTube about "Special Crossings For Horses In Britain". It was the first in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL96C35uN7xGI9HGKHsArwxiOejecVyNem">Things You Might Not Know</a> series, but more importantly it was the start of a streak.</p>
<p>Tom maintained a streak of posting a video approximately once a week for the next ten years.</p>
<p>Yesterday, he ended that streak with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DKv5H5Frt0">After ten years, it's time to stop making videos</a>. He's not done with YouTube, but he's no longer holding himself to that intimidating weekly schedule.</p>



<p>I strongly recommend watching his final video. There's a moment when you realize what he's up to in it which is quite delightful.</p>
<p>I've known Tom for a long time. I made an appearance in the 11th "Things You Might Not Know" video, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNUhKkNY6x0"> A Zeppelin, A Cat, and The World's First In-Flight Radio Message</a>, two weeks into his streak (he was doing one a day at first), filmed at our leaving-the-UK-for-the-USA party in January 2014.</p>
<p>Watching from afar has been somewhat surreal. I didn't watch every video, but every now and then I'd see that Tom was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYGFczNMAMk">flying with the Red Arrows</a>, or visiting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUVZbBBHrI4">yet another nuclear reactor site</a>, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BdZPFzH2JY">overcoming his fear of rollercoasters</a>. And then I'd notice that he'd picked up another million subscribers.</p>
<p>Hanging out with Tom was fun because he would inevitably be recognised by someone. 6.3 million subscribers is a lot of people!</p>
<p>Tom's success on YouTube comes down to a whole bunch of different factors. He was already <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYd_8-Ps_kw">a talented public speaker</a>, a skilled researcher, had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadget_Geeks">a brief stint as TV presenter</a> and <a href="https://www.tomscott.com/usvsth3m/">deep understanding of the viral internet</a>.</p>
<p>Experienced YouTubers will tell you that frequency is key to success on that platform. YouTube's audience (and maybe their opaque algorithm) rewards consistency: publishing regularly is a crucial part of building an audience.</p>
<p>Tom is also incredibly conscientious about the content he produces. Take a look at his <a href="https://www.tomscott.com/corrections/">corrections and clarifications</a> page to see how much effort he puts into getting things right: 25 detailed corrections across over 500 videos. See also his recent video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIbfMjZ0ME4"> Every mistake I've made since 2014</a>.</p>
<p>His most significant correction became <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wif1EAgEQKI">a whole new video</a> clarifying how London fire brigades handled uninsured buildings in the 18th century, backed by <a href="https://www.tomscott.com/corrections/firemarks/">two weeks of paid research</a> by an archives and heritage research consultant. His <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m__OZ3ZsO4Y&amp;t=335s">commitment to accessibility</a> is inspiring as well.</p>
<p>And then there was the streak.</p>
 Escalating streaks 
<p>The best way to get really good at anything is to do that thing on a regular basis, thoughtfully, and with the goal of doing it slightly better every time.</p>
<p>Tom's streak publishing a video to YouTube once a week for ten years is the single best illustration I've ever seen of that principle in action.</p>
<p>His initial videos were interesting, educational and had his signature enthusiastic energy, but they weren't exactly high budget affairs.</p>
<p>As he iterated on the format, he started to figure out what worked. His scripts got tighter, his research deeper and he started working with professionals to improve his production values.</p>
<p>He also learned to use his growing audience to gain access to a dizzying array of fascinating locations, experts and experiences.</p>
<p>The amount of work he invested in this project is staggering. The research, logistics, travel, writing, filming, editing and community management involved are hard for me to even comprehend.</p>
<p>The end result is something truly extraordinary. What a legacy! That final video has over 42,000 comments already, overwhelmingly thankful and positive.</p>
 Streaks can be insidious 
<p>In Tom's closing video he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So now it’s time to take a breather. I can’t keep this up. This is my dream job, and I have a lot of fun doing it. I know I’m incredibly lucky. But a dream job is still a job. And it’s a job that keeps getting bigger and more complicated and I am so tired! There’s nothing in my life right now except work. I did get close to burning out, but fortunately I always knew when to step back from the brink.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Streaks are a powerful psychological tool. Once Tom got to nine years, there was no way he wasn't going to push through to ten. I'm glad for his sake that in hitting that final milestone he's finally able to take a break!</p>
 My own experience with streaks 
<p>I've found great benefit from streaks myself. I'm on day 1,826 (that's 5 years yesterday) of a <a href="https://duolingo.com/">Duolingo</a> streak, primarily learning Spanish. It's kind of working - from an investment of less than 15 minutes a day I'm now able to understand ~90% of news articles written in that language.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There are certainly more effective ways to learn a language, but I've tried different approaches in the past and nothing ever stuck for me to the point that I made real progress.</p>
<p>It turns out the streak mechanism was exactly what I needed. That tiny piece of effort, repeated every day over multiple years, really does add up.</p>
<p>I'm also <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/weeknotes/">172 entries</a> into my streak of publishing weeknotes - not-quite-weekly (more at-least-monthly) posts about what I've been doing, which I use mainly as an accountability tool to keep myself on track despite working independently without any form of boss.</p>
<p>A few years ago I started a website about <a href="https://www.niche-museums.com/">tiny museums I have been to</a>. I used streak pressure to bootstrap the site: I added a museum once a day for a hundred days, digging through old photos and memories.</p>
<p>My streaks are noway near the same league as Tom's. That's why I introduced the term escalating streaks earlier in this post - to emphasize that the true magic comes when you mindfully improve with every iteration.</p>
<p>I did however notice that by the end of my 100 day museum streak I was writing <a href="https://www.niche-museums.com/100">significantly higher quality</a> articles than <a href="https://www.niche-museums.com/1">when I first started</a>.</p>
 Flexibility and forgiveness is crucial 
<p>Streaks have multiple dangers. At one extreme, they can take over your life, forcing you to leave home behind and spend a decade traveling the world making increasingly brilliant YouTube videos.</p>
<p>The other challenge is what happens when you accidentally break them.</p>
<p>In the past, I've tried my hand at strict streaks... and then found that 100 days in I miss a day, and suddenly I'm reset to zero and I lose all motivation to continue.</p>
<p>The solution here is to build in some flexibility. I started a new streak recently to reply to at least one email every day, to encourage me to spend more time in my inbox. My goal for this is four out of seven days, so I can miss three days a week and still keep the streak going.</p>
<p>Duolingo has a "streak freeze" mechanism which can be used to forgive the occasional mishap, which I'm happy to take advantage of.</p>
<p>Initially I felt like this was "cheating", but it really isn't. Streaks are a powerful motivational tool if you figure out the best way to apply them.</p>
 The Tom Scott Streak 
<p>Three of my biggest inspirations in life are these:</p>
 
 The movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Into_the_Spider-Verse">Into the Spider-Verse</a>, demonstrating what happens when a group of creative people get together, rewrite the rules and elevate the quality bar for an entire industry. 
 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Brq-exSvB7Q">Tom Holland's "Umbrella"</a> performance on Lip Sync Battle, showing what happens when someone takes an opportunity and executes it with such skill, enthusiasm and panache that people are still talking about it six years later. 
 Ray Bandar's <a href="https://www.niche-museums.com/100">Basement Full of Skulls</a>, a 60-year project resulting in 7,000+ meticulously preserved animal skulls, leading me to ask "what's MY basement full of skulls going to be?" 
 
<p>Today I'm adding a fourth thing to that list: the Tom Scott Streak.</p>

   After ten years, it's time to stop making videos. 
 Ten years ago, my friend Tom Scott started a deliberate streak of posting YouTube videos - initially about one a day before settling into a cadence of one a week. He kept that up for the full ten years, growing his subscribers to over 6 million in the process. 

 Today he's ending that streak, in unparalleled style.

  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DKv5H5Frt0">After ten years, it's time to stop making videos.</a></p>
<p>Ten years ago, my friend Tom Scott started a deliberate streak of posting YouTube videos - initially about one a day before settling into a cadence of one a week. He kept that up for the full ten years, growing his subscribers to over 6 million in the process.</p>

<p>Today he's ending that streak, in unparalleled style.</p>

My last four boxes of Trader Joe’s High Fiber Cereal
<p>A while back, my gastroenterologist insisted that I get accustomed to eating high-fiber cereal in the morning. And so I have. It does work.</p>
<p>He recommended Fiber One. I didn’t like it, but I put up with it until I found Trader Joe’s version, which tasted much better. Since Bloomington is more than an hour from a Trader Joe’s in Indianapolis (there are two on the north side, while we are way down to the south), I stock up when we’re up that way.</p>
<p>Or I used to.</p>
<p>In Palm Desert for Thanksgiving, I went to a Trader Joe’s there to find High Fiber Cereal missing from the shelves. When I asked a crew member (they’re called that) if they had any in the back, she came back out with the manager to tell me that High Fiber Cereal had, regrettably, been discontinued.</p>
<p>I did not take it well.</p>
<p>I then told them that I also lament earlier discontinuations of the house-brand Ancient Grains granola and its thick, labneh-like strained Greek yogurt. As I reported in the chapter about Trader Joe’s in The Intention Economy, the company takes customer requests to heart.</p>
<p>I also <a href="https://www.cozymeal.com/magazine/fiber-one-shortage">see here</a> that Fiber One is not getting out to store shelves, thanks to what General Mills calls “supply issues.” Since most of Trader Joe’s branded goods are made by other companies (including, presumably, General Mills), perhaps High Fiber Cereal will be re-continued.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, here’s to a good digestive 2024.</p>

<p>December 22, 2023 was my last day at <a href="https://nytimes.com/">The New York Times</a>. My tenure was just
under two and a half years.</p>
<p>My first 19 months at the company were pretty much everything <a href="https://justatheory.com/2021/08/sign-o-the-times/" title="Sign O' The Times">I had hoped</a>, as
I collaborated with Design and Product to design a distributed platform and
conceived, designed, and implemented <a href="https://justatheory.com/2023/10/cipherdoc/" title="CipherDoc: A Searchable, Encrypted JSON Document Service on Postgres">CipherDoc</a>, a service for encrypted data
management. I’m incredibly proud of that work!</p>
<p>But alas, plans change. After the company mothballed the project, I refocused my
time on <a href="https://noidea.dog/glue" title="Tanya Reilly: “Being Glue”">glue work</a>: re-platforming services, upgrading runtimes and
dependencies, improving logging and observability, and documenting code,
architectures, and playbooks. It felt good to reduce the onboarding,
maintenance, and on-call overhead for my teams; I hope it helps them to be more
productive and fulfilled in their work.</p>
<p>I treasure the terrific people I met at The Times, just super thoughtful,
empathetic, and creative co-workers, partners, and colleagues. It’s no wonder
they had the energy to form a union, <a href="https://nytimesguild.org/tech/">The Times Tech Guild</a>, for which I’m
gratified to have helped organize and steward members. The Guild connected me
with a far broader range of talented and committed people than I would have
otherwise. I will miss them all, and continue to cheer for and support the
movement from the outside.</p>
<p>And now, as 2023 winds down, I’ve decided to try something new. More news
in the new year!</p>

  In 2019, I transitioned from independent consulting to IDEMIA, contributing to the ISO subcommittee for Mobile Driving License.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>In 2019 I decided to leave independent consulting and join a large corporation – IDEMIA – you might notice their logos at airport security stations. My job was to be embedded in the ISO subcommittee for Mobile Driving License, a.k.a. the ISO 18013-5 mDL standard and to support IDEMIA’s mobile eID/mDL product team. This was a great extension of my existing work on digital credentials in other ISO subcommittees and W3C groups. Being tied to a product team was a new experience for me!</p>



<p>In 2021 I moved to Ping Identity to support the product team for PingOne Neo – ID Verify and Digital Credentials. My focus remained on government-issued digital credentials via ISO mDL and to establish implementations of inter-company digital credentials . I had the privilege of working beside incredibly experienced and generous standards experts who continue to be deeply embedded in OpenID Foundation, IETF, FIDO, Open Wallet Foundation core work. The novelty of Ping was to see how a new product can be engineered to fit into an overarching suite of enterprise products. The interplay of product and corporate priorities on the one hand and the long time scale of standardization on the other led to some “interesting” discussions over my time at Ping.</p>



<p>One constant throughout has been my involvement with <a href="http://KantaraInitiative.org">Kantara Initiative</a>. This non-profit corporation continues to be a bright light in the world of trustworthy use identity and personal information. I’m currently Chair of the Identity Assurance Work Group and since 2023, Chair of the Board of Directors. Kantara has had great fortune in our Executive Directors over the years – from Joni Brennan to Colin Wallis and now Kay Chopard. The Board is working hard to strengthen our program offerings (as a conformance body for NIST 800-63 and the UK DIATF), expand into new geographies, and sustain innovation in our community work groups – while fiscally prudent and in line with our fiduciary duty to the organization and its members.</p>



<p>At the end of 2023, I have decided to pivot my attention to a big missing piece in the digital credentials story – how to ensure that the recipient of a digital credential is a real human (and the intended one), and that the presenter of a digital credential is in fact authorized to do so. I have joined <a href="http://www.facetec.com">Facetec</a> to dive deep into the world of liveness-proven biometric verification. Their tech is impressive. The SDK uses the mobile device camera to construct a 3D face model of the person from which it determines whether there’s a real living human present, whether the session is a spoof attempt (using physical artifacts or video playbacks), and whether images are being injected bypassing the camera subsystem. The server SDK completes the liveness analysis and performs highly-accurate matching against a known-good reference. My job? Same-same. Working with international standards bodies (such as ISO SC 37) and testing labs to develop or extend standards for performance evaluation of this new 3D face biometric mode. I’m ingesting big stacks of documents and trying to work out where standardization of user-supplied biometric-enabled devices stands today – in comparison with the well-established border security/public safety modes of operation. This is exciting new ground and appears to be mostly greenfield – and it all ties back to the IDM and digital credentials industry. </p>

Prompt: ” hardscrabble farms next to a suburb full of volvo station wagons”
<p>Several thousand years ago, when I was on leave from journalism and working as a marketing dweeb, my small North Carolina firm learned about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claritas_Prizm">PRIZM (Potential Rating Index for Zip Markets)</a>, a techy new service that told me that my rural zip code was “Hardscrabble,” while the next one over was a suburb PRIZM called “Volvo Wagons” or something.</p>
<p>My current zip, in Bloomington, Indiana, features five out of PRIZM’s 68 numbered types:</p>
 
 48 Generation Web—Low Income Younger Family Mix 
 47 Striving Selfies—Lower Midscale Middle Age Mostly w/o Kids 
 15 New Homesteaders—Wealthy Middle Age Mostly w/ Kids 
 51 Campers &amp; Camo—Lower Midscale Middle Age Family Mix 
 66 New Beginnings—Low Income Younger Family Mix 
 
<p>None of which describes me or my wife.</p>
<p>Sort of close is 05 – Country Squires: “Members of this segment fled the city life for the charms of small-town living. Many have executive jobs and live in recently built homes.” Except we didn’t flee and our home was built in&nbsp; 1899 or 1915. (Sources differ.) But we are building a house, so maybe that counts.</p>
<p>A bit closer is 20 – Empty Nests: “Most residents are over 65 years old, but they show no interest in a rest-home retirement. With their grown-up children out of the house they pursue active, and activist, lifestyles.”</p>
<p>But all of that stuff is just name-calling against typified populations—a form of -ism not much different than racism, sexism, or ageism. That’s why, on the receiving end, we tend not to like it, even if it brings us ‘relevant’ messages from sellers. (This happens far less than sellers think, and typically at the cost of privacy lost to surveillance.)</p>
<p>All of us are as different as our faces and voices. Being different than everybody—even ourselves five minutes ago—is among our most human qualities. We all grow and change constantly, whether we want to or not.</p>
<p>Marketing didn’t get that when PRIZM was invented in 1980, and it doesn’t get it today, for the simple reason that marketing was not built for talking to people. It was built for typifying people.</p>
<p><a href="https://doc.searls.com/2021/12/21/rage-in-peace/">Chris Locke</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Weinberger">David Weinberger</a>, Rick Levine, and I all thought there was hope for marketing when we wrote <a href="http://cluetrain.com">The Cluetrain Manifesto</a> in 1999, because we saw the Internet as a radically new way to connect the demand and supply sides of markets directly, and personally.</p>
<p>But marketing instead saw the Internet as a great way to spy on people and to typify them more than ever.&nbsp; PRIZM persists, entrenched as ever. And conversations among customers and marketers happen in two very different and disconnected echo chambers, mostly using giant corporate platforms.</p>
<p>For a sense of how thoroughly disconnected those chambers are, see any of Tom Fishburne’s <a href="https://marketoonist.com/">Marketoons</a>. They’re brilliant and spot-on.</p>
<p>They also make clear—at least to me—that Cluetrain won’t prove right until marketing gets out of the way.</p>
<p>Which it won’t on its own. Our side—the customers’ side—needs to obsolesce it.</p>
 
<p>The image above was generated by the prompt in the caption under it, using what currently calls itself <a href="https://www.bing.com/images/create/">Microsoft Bing Image Creator from Designer</a>, which persists Microsoft’s long tradition of aversive and unmemorable names for products.</p>

<p>
I’m lucky to have two hands, let’s be clear, and the minor struggles I’ve had with them over the years don’t qualify as any kind of real hardship. Yet there have been a lot of small injuries — an ongoing annoyance made worse by being mostly my fault.</p>
<p>
Consider the most recent incident. To relieve strain on my left hand, I switched a few months ago from a steel-string to a nylon-string guitar. I knew I wanted the lesser force required to press nylon strings, and the vacation from steel strings has really helped. The wider spacing between the strings is also better for my hands, I realized as I settled in. I’d started on a classical guitar, then hadn’t owned one in decades, it feels good to have one again and I’ve been playing it a lot.</p>
<p>
Being the guy who wrote a blog post about an early warning system for RSI <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2023/07/23/is-there-an-early-warning-system-for-rsi/">not even six months</a> ago, I see the absurdity of my situation. Back in July I was rehabbing an overextended little finger. Now I’m rehabbing a thumb and related muscles insulted by my failure to properly adapt to the new instrument. </p>
<p>
You can wrap your thumb around the narrower neck of a steel-string guitar in order to grab the lowest string. You can do that with the wider neck of classical guitar too. But as I probably learned the first time and then forgot, you really shouldn’t. A D major chord with F# in the bass is too much of a stretch for the thumb, at least for my thumb, on a classical guitar. You won’t see classical guitarists do that. Instead they’ll make a tripod with the index, middle, and ring fingers. </p>
<p>
So once again I get to rewire my hand posture. Which, again, is a minor hardship, not remotely comparable to the guy I mentioned last time who had to switch sides and learn to fret with his right hand. As I also mentioned there, he found an upside. Now he’s a switch-hitter who can use both halves of his brain directly. In my case, I’m trying to embrace the rewiring as a way to break a habit and form new neural pathways. It’d be nice, though, if that weren’t always a response to self-inflicted injury!</p>
<p>
But like I said, it’s a minor hardship. My hands could have been mangled in my dad’s car engine that one time, or in the anchor chain of Ben Smith’s boat that other time: two escapes from disaster that still provoke the occasional nightmare. I’m lucky to have these two hands, and again vow to take better care of them.</p>
<p>
Why is it so hard (for me, at least) to detect and avoid injurious hand postures? I guess it’s because whatever you’re projecting — when you write sentences or lines of code, or play notes and chords — has to flow through your hands with minimal conscious attention to your hands. Note to self: pay more attention.</p>

<p>
Nuclear physicists know they are dancing with the devil when they bring fissile material to criticality. They also know that the reaction can be controlled, that it must be, and that the means of control obey well-understood principles. </p>
<p>
Social sites typically push toward supercriticality with no such understanding. If Goodreads enshittifies at 125 million users, why would another service expect a different outcome at similar scale? </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
We can learn from a natural experiment. Not mentioned in the story is a long-running service, <a href="https://librarything.com">LibraryThing</a>, that’s been going strong since 2005. I interviewed its founder and lead developer, Tim Spalding, back in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729204047id_/http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail3595.html">2008</a>. Listening to that interview again today reminded me that everything I loved about LibraryThing remains important and matters even more now. </p>
<p>
LibraryThing was, and remains, a place where you make and share lists of books in order to connect with other people and with books — not primarily via friend relationships but rather book relationships. It’s a small business that’s kept Tim and his crew happily engaged in serving a few million bibliophiles, some of whom pay a membership fee to be super-cataloguers. </p>
<p>
I’m not in LibraryThing’s core demographic. Books aren’t as central to my life as they are to members of the service who carefully curate their own lists, tag books and authors, contribute to a <a href="https://www.librarything.com/commonknowledge/">common knowledge wiki</a>, and write reviews. But I appreciate their work when I visit the site.</p>
<p>
Today I added Ed Yong’s remarkable <a href="https://www.librarything.com/catalog/Jon.Udell&amp;bookid=254714845">An Immense World</a> to my list. Among the book’s dozens of reviews on the site, I found a <a href="https://www.librarything.com/work/27607715/reviews/219586107">2000-word essay</a> that usefully highlights many of the strange (to humans) powers of animal perception that Yong describes. </p>
<p>
I guess LibraryThing isn’t on the Times’ radar because it hasn’t reached a critical mass of … what, exactly? Tens of millions of people? Hundreds of millions? I’m glad it hasn’t! That’s a recipe for meltdown. LibraryThing has been going strong, for almost two decades, in the Goldilocks zone: neither too little activity nor too much, just the right amount for meaningful experiences at human scale. </p>
<p>
I feel the same way about Mastodon. Conventional wisdom says it’s dead in the water: “nobody” goes there, no Mastodon apps <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/12/app_store_rankings_as_a_proxy_for_social_network_momentum">rank highly</a> in the app stores. But if critical mass means operating at the scale of Twitter or Facebook, then who wants that? Who benefits from the inevitable enshittification? Not me, and probably not you.</p>
<p>
LibraryThing shows that a controlled reaction, at smaller scale, is sustainable over time. Mastodon so far has been successful in the same way, and I see no reason why that can’t continue. Although Mastodon is young, my connections there date back to social networking’s roots in the early blogosphere. It feels like the right amount of critical mass. For me, a billion people on Mastodon is an anti-goal. I would much rather see hundreds or maybe thousands of healthy communities emerge, each operating in its own Goldilocks zone. Many small and safe critical masses, instead of a few huge and dangerous ones, powering small businesses whose proprietors are — like Tim Spalding and his crew — able to maintain real relationships with their customers. </p>
<p>
That global conversation we thought we were having on Twitter? We don’t know how to control that reaction and I’m not sure it makes sense to try. </p>

<p>As I have come to see it, the world consists of mounds of information, much of it digital. Our days are spent encountering, reacting, and sifting through it. Our conscious genius pulls together threads from which are crafted uplifting, foreboding, humorous, and tragic stories. We live inside these stories alone or with like-minded people. Most of the time our minds simply tweak and update unfolding dramas of consensus reality or a particular flavor of alternate reality; it’s an efficient, largely automatic process.</p>
<p>Rarely do we toss out whole plot lines and start from scratch. Why? Well, there would be so many subplots left hanging and so many question marks around our relational identities that the uncertainty of getting everything sorted out means it’s generally easier to keep on the established path. Jettisoning a comfortably broken-in outlook is a very messy business; and how often, really, do we feel the need to, or empowered to, rip apart the boxes we inhabit?</p>
<p>Each of us has the ability to craft amazing stories out of fascinating facts and extend invitations to loved ones and complete strangers to come inside and look around, sit a spell, and make themselves at home. There is, however, no way to compel another person to hang out in the story you made. You can’t even force them to cross your threshold. Exhort and cajole all you want, the stories we inhabit remain a personal choice, as they should be. Just as you wouldn’t want to have to live inside someone else’s ill-fitting story, the same goes for everyone else. It’s a hard truth. It can hurt.</p>
<p>Our acceptance of the primacy of the digital world has meant that the velocity and intensity of social physics has changed. My experience of these changes have been dramatic and potentially catastrophic, at least in the short run. The web3 protocol layer system seems intent on launching us all into a digital-twin simulation cloudmind whether we’ve elected to participate or not. Left in the wake of this century-long noetic campaign is the wreckage of once deeply-held relationships, relationships with those who are (or were) close to us in heart – actual physical hearts, not emojis, up-votes, and clicks.</p>
<p>There are too many digital stories, too many doors, too much unease with the masses either searching for answers or working really hard to avoid seeing the holes being torn in the fabric of what we once understood as “reality.” Our story rooms may now be filled with people from far flung corners of the globe. These are people whose heart fields we’ll probably never have the opportunity to feel directly – no mingled auras from warm embraces, conversations over cups of tea, shared meals, card games, porch sitting, bonfires, jam sessions.</p>
<p>In some cases, those whose heart fields we shared in the actual world have wandered off to the digital rooms of sirens, forsaking old connections for greener pastures. The transformation, turbo-charged by the lockdowns, happened with ferocious speed and offered little chance for redress, remedy, or reconciliation. We didn’t know what hit us. Then it was over, and everything had changed.</p>
<p>This is the first Christmas I’ve ever spent alone, totally alone. I was cancelled for breaking out of my box, looking around, asking questions, and imploring people to start having conversations about emerging technology and cybernetics and finance and consciousness and gaming before we go the way of the Lotus Eaters. Maybe I was cancelled for my intensity. I don’t know, the only thing I was told is that it was about “my research.” </p>
<p>I’ve made it through a tearful week. Lots of tears shed during my Christmas Eve read aloud finishing “Momo.” I apologize for the five-month gap, but I know in my heart I was supposed to read it last night. I keep saying time is not what we think it is. In the end of Ende’s story, the hour-lily wielding Momo and the tortoise Cassiopeia save the day and defeat the time bankers. The children return to the amphitheater for free play, grown-ups shelve their Taylorist tendencies, the town’s humanity is restored, and Momo doesn’t have to be alone anymore.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The “Momo” read-aloud playlist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnNSjVGWqTO459LMtWwG0z4jKbv92moN5">here</a>.</p>
<p>I feel we are on Earth, sparks of God’s divine creation, to experience, falter, learn, and feel in the depths of our souls. The holidays are a season of big feelings – even more so when you’ve lost a loved one to the great beyond and other loved ones to the pit-traps of sinister social physics. The afternoon was mild here in Philadelphia, and I took the opportunity to fill my basket with gatherings and head out to the Kelpius Cave in the Wissahickon- alchemy of the soul. What better balm could there be than to lay out a heart-felt intention to close a rocky year?</p>
<p></p>
<p>When I thought that I was going to decamp to Seattle in the summer I took all of my precious nature materials with a friend to Valley Forge and created a magnificent spiral between Mount Misery and Mount Joy. Since I returned, I’ve accumulated a few more items – feathers and quartz from Arkansas, acorns from Laurel Hill cemetery, dried flowers from birthday carnations I bought myself, and gifts from friends across the country. I took them with a candle to the park and lit up the darkness and asked God for guidance to do the next right thing. </p>
<p>Once you’ve ripped up the boxes you really need a divine compass.</p>
<p>The coming year should bring new opportunities in Hot Springs, Arkansas after we sell the family home in the spring – fingers crossed someone wants to pay a good price for a well-loved 1880s row house with many original features. I’m hoping 2024 will be gentler than the clear-the-decks tsunami of the past six months. I met my husband when I was twenty. We grew up together. This divorce is my first break-up. I know that sounds ridiculous, and yet it’s true. I am my own person, and I know my own mind. That said, I’m going to have to craft my own new traditions and ways of doing things as a single person and doing that feels overwhelming right now. Will I ever celebrate Christmas again? It’s hard to say. It’s also been two years since my child has spoken to me. Prayers for reconciliation would be welcome. I still love my family. I am fine with them living in the story of their choice. I think we could create a shared space that bridges our separate boxes.</p>
<p>Despite the waves of difficultly I’ve been navigating since 2019, I know I would die a dysfunctional person had I elected to live the rest of my life inside stories I knew to be fundamentally flawed in their incompleteness and injurious to my spirit. So, I’m just going to put one foot in front of the other and try not to be afraid of a future with a lone heart-field. </p>
<p>I’m Jerry Hawver’s daughter, and Hawvers “git er done.”</p>
<p>Merry Christmas everyone. Thanks for stopping by my story, even if we can’t mingle our actual auras. May the new year bring blessings to you and your loved ones. Our power is in the heart – hugs all around. Hug your people as much as you can while you have them near you. It’s a sad day when you have no one to hug.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>A light in the darkness.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Stones and brick, rubble from the floor of the “cave,” outline the heart.&nbsp; A ring of soft pine needles mingled with dried purple carnations and white Alstroemeria sprinkled with green leaves gifted from California and the last of my creosote gifted to me last year by Dru in Tucson for my birthday – it smells like the desert in the rain.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The next ring was an outline of pinecones gathered in the park with ferns and white pine sprigs and gifted dandelion seed heads that lit up the dark like stars.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I used a large stone as a centerpiece to hold many assorted lovely things lit by a candle.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A soft, leathery buckeye casing holding a spiral shell and manzanita berries with some Arkansas quartz below it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Quartz and a shed snakeskin for sparkly new beginnings.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The last sprig of sage from Standing Rock gifted to me by Jason with a bit of fungus above it and acorns from which mighty things grow.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And an oak leaf for strength and fortitude.</p>
<p></p>
<p>River pebbles – may the rich tapestry of our experiences, both beautiful and challenging, rub us to a polished crystalline smooth symmetry.</p>
<p></p>
<p>May we have the wits to find our way through the worm holes and arrive on the other side.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Smoke from a wrapped mullein leaf gifted to me by a beautiful family in Washington state, thank you kind herbalist and standing farmer.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And this ridiculous figurine was already there when I arrived, in a niche made from where a portion of the wall had fallen away. I have no idea of the meaning behind it, but I suspect the trickster energy was perhaps expecting me. Bittersweet.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Philadelphia has brought me a depth of understanding my life would not have had if I had landed somewhere else. While I am grateful for its many stories, I see it’s time to move on. Goodbye for now Kelpius Cave, ritual anchor for the Nephele era.</p>

<p>今年も季節のご挨拶。バッハのシチリアーノを主にシチリア島の風景をバックにお届けします。使っているフルートは1920年代にロンドンで作られたコーカスウッド製のフルート Louis （製造番号81番）と、たぶん40年ほど前に作られたと思われるTOKAIスピネット（小型のチェンバロ）です。フルートの方は今年しっかりとオーバーホールしてかなり良い状態になりました。 </p>



<p>このシチリアーノは、バッハの作品の中で最も有名な曲の一つですが、一方では贋作疑惑がある曲でもあります。スタイルがバッハとちょっと違うのです。同時代のクヴァンツの曲を下敷きに弟子が書いたものにバッハが手を入れたのではないかとも言われています。これをバッハ作と伝えているのは、次男のこれも大作曲家のC.P.E.バッハ（彼についてはわたしの<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2014/08/2498/">ブログ「クラシック音楽の父、C.P.E.バッハ〜生誕300年」</a>を御覧ください）がそう記録しているからですが、弟子である彼自身が書いたものに父親が手を入れたものに父の名を記録したのではないかとも言われています<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/12/5465/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-5465" title="詳しくは、<a href=&quot;https://sakimura.org/2014/02/2206/&quot;>「バッハのシチリアーノって、J.S.Bach作じゃ無いよね…」</a>をご参照ください。">1</a>。</p>



<p>ことしもいろいろなことが有りました。身近な人も何人も亡くしました<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/12/5465/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-5465" title="松下さん、Vittorioさん、Morio さん">2</a>。世界の情勢も暗い色を示しており、女性や子供を多く含む非戦闘員が虐殺されています。なぜ人類は歴史に学ばないのかと思わせる日々です。そのような情勢から、普段の年とは違い、非宗教的な曲を選びました。本当はフォーレのIn Paradisumか賛美歌のVeni Emanuel をやろうかと思っていたのですが、地名が出てきてしまう<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/12/5465/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-5465" title="それぞれ、エルサレム、イスラエル、が出てくる">3</a>ので…。 </p>



<p>曲の背景の動画は主にシチリア島のものです。エトナ山やシラクサの灯台などが出てきます。平和な風景と音楽とが、みなさまの心に平安をもたらしますことを。 それでは、良い年の瀬を。</p>

I do a lot more cycling in Sonoma County, California than was possible in Cheshire County, New Hampshire. The Mediterranean climate here, which enables me to ride year-round, is a blessing for my mental and physical well-being. And because the topography is even more rugged, I’m doing more climbing that ever. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Yesterday, Luann dropped me at the Coleman Overlook on the coast and I cycled home from there. I’m not a fast climber, I can’t keep up with younger friends when we cycle together, and <a href="https://www.mapmyride.com/routes/view/5857726231">my rides</a> aren’t extreme by local standards. But my cumulative elevation gain over the course of a year far exceeds what it ever was back east, and I’ve had plenty of time to reflect on climbing strategy.</p>
<p>
A better gear ratio would help, but my older road bike won’t accommodate that. So on the steepest pitches I switch to a weaving ascent that eases the grade, which I’ve decided is OK. For a while I resisted shoes with cleats that lock into pedals, but now I use them to gain extra leverage which really helps. </p>
<p>
It’s never mainly about the equipment, though, the real challenge is always mental. How do you think about reaching the top of the big hill you’re climbing? One piece of conventional wisdom: don’t look ahead. If you look down at the road you aren’t forced to think about the grade, or your slow progress up it. Instead you see pavement moving beneath you, and feel steady progress.</p>
<p>
Of course that defeats the purpose of cycling through spectacular Sonoma County landscapes. Recently a friend suggested a different strategy: look to the side. Of course! There’s little or no traffic on many of these routes, so it’s safe to do that. And the effect is mesmerizing.</p>
<p>
I’ve <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/03/06/the-3d-splendor-of-the-sonoma-county-landscape/">described</a> it like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Everything looks different from everywhere. You’re always seeing multiple overlapping planes receding into the distance, like dioramas. And they change dramatically as you move around even slightly. Even just ten paces in any direction, or a slight change in elevation, can alter the sightlines completely and reveal or hide a distant landmark.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
So, don’t look ahead to the top of the hill, and don’t look down at the road. Look left and right to see sliding panels of majestic scenery. It really helps!</p>

<p>I asked ChatGPT and Bard to “List all Christmas holiday tunes in chronological order, by the year they were written, running from oldest at the top to the newest at the bottom.” ChatGPT gave me a lame list. Bard gave me a much better one, improved by my follow-ups. Here ya go:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While creating a definitive chronological list of every Christmas tune throughout history is near impossible, I can offer you a comprehensive, categorized timeline of notable Christmas music spanning centuries, from ancient hymns to modern-day pop hits. Keep in mind this is not an exhaustive list, and some dates may be approximate:</p>
<p>Pre-Renaissance Era (Before 1450)</p>
 
 4th Century:&nbsp;“Hymnus ad Natales Domine Jesu” (attributed to Hilary of Poitiers) – One of the earliest known Latin hymns referencing Jesus’ birth. 
 13th Century:&nbsp;“In dulci jubilo” – Traditional German carol celebrating the joy of Christmas. 
 14th Century:&nbsp;“O Come, All Ye Faithful” – Latin hymn, believed to be of English origin, later translated into many languages. 
 
<p>Renaissance Era (1450-1600)</p>
 
 15th Century:&nbsp;“There Is No Rose” – Traditional English carol referencing Mary as a “spotless rose.” 
 15th Century:&nbsp;“Deck the Halls” – Welsh carol with pagan roots, originally a celebration of the winter solstice. 
 
<p>Baroque Era (1600-1750)</p>
 
 1642:&nbsp;“What Child Is This?” – English carol based on a poem by William Chatterton Dix. 
 1678:&nbsp;“Silent Night” – German carol written by Franz Xaver Gruber and Joseph Mohr. 
 
<p>Classical Era (1750-1830)</p>
 
 1818:&nbsp;“O Holy Night” – French carol originally titled “Cantique de Noël” with lyrics by Placide Cappeau and music by Adolphe Adam. 
 
<p>Romantic Era (1830-1900)</p>
 
 1865:&nbsp;“Jingle Bells” – American song originally written by James Lord Pierpont with lyrics unrelated to Christmas. 
 1874:&nbsp;“O Little Town of Bethlehem” – American carol written by Phillips Brooks. 
 
<p>20th Century and Beyond</p>
 
 1934:&nbsp;“Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” – American song written by Ralph Blane and Hugh Martin for the Judy Garland film “Meet Me in St. Louis.” 
 1942:&nbsp;“White Christmas” – American song written by Irving Berlin for the film “Holiday Inn.” 
 1953:&nbsp;“Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree” – American rock and roll song written by Johnny Marks. 
 1964:&nbsp;“Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer” – American song written by Johnny Marks, based on the poem by Robert L. May. 
 1973:&nbsp;“All I Want for Christmas Is You” – American pop song written and performed by Mariah Carey. 
 1984:&nbsp;“Last Christmas” – English song written by George Michael for Wham! 
 1994:&nbsp;“Santa Claus Is Comin’ to Town” – American song written by J.C. Sprink and Haven Gillespie. 
 2019:&nbsp;“All Is Well” – British song written and performed by James Arthur. 
 
<p>This list showcases the evolution of Christmas music through various eras and genres. Remember, Christmas music is constantly evolving, with new carols and songs emerging every year.</p>
<p>Happy Holidays!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, “What about A Chrismas Song, by Mel Tormé? Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas? Frosty the Snowman? Mary’s Boy Child?”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You’re absolutely right! I apologize for omitting those wonderful Christmas classics from my previous response. Here’s where they fit into the timeline:</p>
 
 1946:&nbsp;“Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” – As mentioned previously, this beloved song by Judy Garland was written in 1934 by Ralph Blane and Hugh Martin. 
 1951:&nbsp;“A Christmas Song” – This charming and introspective tune by Mel Tormé perfectly captures the bittersweet sentiment of Christmas. 
 1950:&nbsp;“Frosty the Snowman” – Jack Rollins and Steve Nelson penned this playful Christmas carol about a jolly snowman in 1950. 
 1956:&nbsp;“Mary’s Boy Child” – This moving gospel carol was written by Jester Hairston in 1956, based on an African American spiritual. 
 
<p>My apologies for the earlier oversight. These songs undoubtedly deserve their place among the cherished Christmas tunes throughout history.</p>
<p>Do you have any other Christmas music questions for me? I’m happy to delve deeper into the fascinating world of holiday melodies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, “Oh, and Rockin Around the Christmas Tree?”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ah, you’re absolutely right! How could I forget the infectious energy of “Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree”? It definitely belongs on the list. In fact, it was written earlier than some of the others I mentioned:</p>
 
 1958:&nbsp;“Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree” – This rock n’ roll Christmas classic,&nbsp;penned by Johnny Marks,&nbsp;brought a vibrant and playful edge to holiday music. 
 
<p>Thank you for reminding me! Your keen eye for festive tunes is impressive. Merry Christmas and keep the musical celebration going!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I stopped there. But I assume you can keep going here: https://bard.google.com/chat/5623a530dcc35251</p>

<p>Die EU-Kommission hat <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/ALL/?uri=COM:2023:797:FIN">gestern die seit Monaten überfällige Bilanz der freiwilligen Chatkontrolle veröffentlicht. </a>Mit der Begründung Kinder schützen zu wollen durchsuchen US-Anbieter massenhaft, anlass- und unterschiedslos private Chats, Nachrichten und E-Mails nach verdächtigen Inhalten. Für den Europaabgeordneten und profiliertesten Gegner der Chatkontrolle Dr. Patrick Breyer (Piratenpartei) ist die Bilanz verheerend:</p>



<p>„Die monatelang verspätete Bilanz der freiwilligen Chatkontrolle entpuppt sich inhaltlich als Luftnummer: Da werden Zahlen zu Verdachtsmeldungen, Identifizierungen und Verurteilungen in den Raum gestellt, ohne dass ein Zusammenhang mit der Chatkontrolle privater Nachrichten belegt ist, weil NCMEC-Meldungen auch auf Nutzermeldungen oder öffentlichen Posts/Webseiten beruhen. Beim einvernehmlichen Sexting die Versender selbstgemachter Nacktbilder zu ‚identifizieren‘, ist keine Kunst und schützt niemanden vor Missbrauch. Damit fehlt jeder Nachweis, dass die eigenmächtige Massenüberwachung unserer privaten Kommunikation durch US-Dienste von Meta, Google oder Microsoft einen signifikanten Beitrag zur Rettung missbrauchter Kinder oder Überführung von Missbrauchtätern leiste. Sie kriminalisiert umgekehrt tausende Minderjähriger, überlastet Strafverfolger und öffnet einer willkürlichen Privatjustiz der Internetkonzerne Tür und Tor.</p>



<p>Im Bericht wird verschwiegen, was <a href="https://video.consilium.europa.eu/event/en/27239">Kommissarin Johansson vor den EU-Innenministern jüngst eingeräumt hat</a>: Nur mit jedem vierten ausgeleiteten Privatfoto oder -video kann die Polizei überhaupt etwas anfangen, zu 75% gelangen durch die Chatkontrolle strafrechtlich völlig irrelevante private und intime Bilder und Videos in Hände von Mitarbeitern, bei denen sie nicht sicher sind. 2022 offenbarten die fehleranfälligen Chatkontrolle-Verdächtigungsmaschinen demnach sage und schreibe 750.000 europäische Privatnachrichten ohne jede polizeiliche Relevanz. So wird das digitale Briefgeheimnis mit Füßen getreten!</p>



<p>Die Verordnung zur freiwilligen Chatkontrolle ist obsolet und grundrechtswidrig: Die sozialen Netzwerke als Hostingdienste brauchen zur Überprüfung öffentlicher Posts keine Verordnung. Und die millionenfachen fehlerträchtigen Verdachtsanzeigen aus der Durchleuchtung privater Kommunikation durch Zuckerbergs Meta-Konzern werden durch die angekündigte Einführung von Ende-zu-Ende-Verschlüsselung ohnehin demnächst entfallen. Das Rechtsgutachten einer ehemaligen EuGH-Richterin belegt, dass die freiwillige Chatkontrolle grundrechtswidrig ist. Ein Missbrauchsbetroffener und ich klagen dagegen, verhandelt wird am 1. Februar 2024. Dieser Irrweg muss schleunigst vom Tisch!“</p>



<p>Breyer kritisiert die von der EU-Kommission favorisierte Chatkontrolle als solutionistischen Irrweg zum Schutz von Kindern: „Mit ihrem in der freien Welt ungekannten gescheiterten Angriff auf das digitale Briefgeheimis und sichere Verschlüsselung sind die ‚Big Sisters‘ Zensursula und Johansson dafür verantwortlich, dass überhaupt nichts zum besseren Schutz unserer Kinder erreicht wird. Mit ihrer unverbesserlichen Obsession für Massenüberwachung verhindern die EU-Kommissarinnen wirklich wirksame Schutzmaßnahmen etwa durch sichere Gestaltung von Internetdiensten (Security by Design). Missbrauchsopfer haben Politiker verdient, die zu einem effektiven, mehrheitsfähigen, grundrechtskonformen und gerichtsfesten Kinderschutz in der Lage sind – wie es im EU-Parlament parteiübergreifend Konsens ist.“</p>



<p>Patrick Breyer, Elina Eickstädt (Chaos Computer Club) und der Bundesdatenschutzbeauftragte Ulrich Kelber werden am 29. Dezember auf dem <a href="https://events.ccc.de/congress/2023/hub/en/event/chatkontrolle_-_es_ist_noch_nicht_vorbei/">Chaos Computer Kongress einen Vortrag zur Zukunft der Chatkontrolle</a> halten.</p>

<p>Ten years ago today the drafts that would be approved as the final OpenID Connect specifications were published, as announced in my post <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=1154">Fourth and possibly last Release Candidates for final OpenID Connect specifications and Notice of 24 hour review period</a>.</p>
<p>The adoption of OpenID Connect has exceeded our wildest expectations.  The vast majority of federated signins to sites and applications today use OpenID Connect.  Android, AOL, Apple, AT&amp;T, Auth0, Deutsche Telekom, ForgeRock, Google, GrabTaxi, GSMA Mobile Connect, IBM, KDDI, Microsoft, NEC, NRI, NTT, Okta, Oracle, Orange, Ping Identity, Red Hat, Salesforce, Softbank, Symantec, T-Mobile, Telefónica, Verizon, Yahoo, and Yahoo! Japan, all use OpenID Connect, and that’s just the tip of the iceberg.  While OpenID Connect is “plumbing” and not a consumer brand, it’s filling a need and doing it well.</p>
<p>It’s fitting that the second set of errata corrections to the OpenID Connect specifications were just approved, as described in the post <a href="https://openid.net/second-errata-set-for-openid-connect-specifications-approved/">Second Errata Set for OpenID Connect Specifications Approved</a>.  While we are proud of the quality of the final specifications, with 9 3/4 years of thousands of developers using and deploying the specifications, it’s unsurprising that issues would be found that needed clarification and correction.</p>
<p>The updated OpenID Connect specifications have just been submitted to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) for Publicly Available Submission (PAS) status.  Approved PAS submissions are published as ISO specifications.  This will foster adoption in jurisdictions that require using standards that are published by organizations with international treaty status.</p>
<p>Celebrations of the <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=1191">tenth anniversary of the approval of OpenID Connect</a> will occur worldwide in 2024.  The first will be in Asia at the <a href="https://www.openid.or.jp/summit/2024/en/">OpenID Summit Tokyo</a> in January.  The second will be in the Americas at <a href="https://identiverse.com/">Identiverse</a> in May.  The third will be in Europe at the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024">European Identity and Cloud Conference</a> in June.  Join us at these events for the celebrations!</p>
<p>I can’t wait to see what the next decade brings for <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a>!</p>

 “Honesty is the best policy,” George Burns said. “If you can fake that you’ve got it made.” 
 
 The same applies to feeling in composition and musical expression. Long ago I went with a friend who was a pianist and composer, to a concert by a somewhat famous pianist. While I was enjoying the concert, she grabbed my hand and pulled us out of the place. “Didn’t you hear it?” she said after we left. “That guy wasn’t feeling it.” 
 
 No AI will ever feel anything. There is no “next level” where it will feel in a human way—or at all—because AIs are machines and the human stuff they do is all emulation. That emulation can do superhuman stuff. But that doesn’t make them human. It makes them uncanny. And useful. (Hell, I’ve quickly come to rely on AI for lots of stuff, every day. It’s extremely handy and often fun.) 
 
 All that uncanny stuff is emulation. Pattern matching. Way-cool parroting. Even when it can beat a human at Go or recite pi to trillions of digits, a machine is still just a machine. It ought to be good at stuff machines are better at than humans. Feeling isn’t one of them. 
 
 Right now I want to finish this post. That&nbsp;want is a feeling in my creative drive. I’m not doing this shit just because I’ve been programmed to do it. 
 
 As you sit, watch, and listen to musicians in a top-ranked orchestra, what amazes you most, besides the music they play, is fellow human beings can do this stuff at all, and do it together. Why sit, watch, and listen to robots doing the same, even if they do all of it better, technically? 
 
 Will there be robot musicians as original, and moving, as Miles Davis? Will robot artists be better at doing Picasso than Picasso? Better at Shakespeare than Shakespeare? 
 
 Not if they can’t feel. And, I submit, none ever will.

<p>This article shows how to setup and sign git commits on Windows for Github. Most of this is already documented on the Github docs, but I ran into trouble when using this with git Extensions on a windows host. My commits could not be signed until I set the home system variable on the windows host.</p>



 Install gpg on Windows 



<p>To sign git commits, you can download the windows <a href="https://www.gpg4win.org/">gpg4win</a> and install it. Git should already be installed. No extra features are required.</p>



 Generate a key on Windows 



<p>The Windows cmd line is used to generate a new gpg key. I have a safe host PC and do not require a passphrase. Other than this, I just used the default settings to generate a new gpg key. </p>



<p>Note: The requested email needs to match the email used on your Github account.</p>

<p>The pub key can be used to export the pub key and upload it to the Github account.</p>



 Use Git Extensions and apply the signing per repo 



<p>I would like to use this key for a single repository. I have multiple user accounts for multiple systems and each have different git requirements. For one Github repository, I would like to sign all commits. I generated the key  in the global user profile but only use the key on this repository.</p>



<p></p>



<p>In the git bash window from the repository, if you want to sign the commits, the following commands can be executed. I open the bash through git extensions. If you already have the key id from the creating of it, you can skip step 3.</p>


  git config commit.gpgsign true

git config --global gpg.program "C:\Program Files (x86)\GnuPG\bin\gpg.exe"

gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long

git config user.signingkey &lt;your key&gt;
  


 Signing key not found 



<p>If the signing key is not found on windows, it is probably because the application is looking in the wrong location for the gpg key. To validate this, open the git bash from the repository and find the Home: value. This must match the value in the windows command line. </p>


  gpg --version
  


<p>Find the value for Home:</p>



<p>Now open and the value in the windows cmd and check that it matches the git bash console. If it does not match, take the window cmd Home: value and add this to the system variables.</p>



<p>Add an environment variable called <code>GNUPGHOME</code> with the value found in the <code>gpg --version</code> cmd</p>







<p></p>



<p>Now the commit should be signed. Next step is to setup Github to use this key.</p>



 Add the gpg key to your Github account 



<p>The gpg key can be attached to the Github account. The docs explain this good.</p>



<p>Github docs: <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/adding-a-gpg-key-to-your-github-account">https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/adding-a-gpg-key-to-your-github-account</a></p>


  gpg --list-secret-keys

gpg -a --export &lt;your-pub-key&gt;
  


<p></p>



<p>Display the verified commits on Github: <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/displaying-verification-statuses-for-all-of-your-commits">https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/displaying-verification-statuses-for-all-of-your-commits</a></p>







<p></p>



<p>When you commit and push, Github should display a verified status</p>







<p></p>



<p>You can now require that all commits are verified for a repository</p>

<p>Recently I made a post on <a href="https://medium.com/@m-ruminer/veramo-and-verifiable-credentials-6e860b3035be">Veramo and Verified Credentials</a> where I discussed a little bit about Veramo and my findings in trying to use it. This post is about <a href="https://www.spruceid.dev/didkit/didkit">DIDKit</a> from SpruceID. DIDKit is another set of packages for creating DIDs, verifiable credentials, verifiable presentations, etc. I only used the command line interface (CLI) tool in my experimentation with it and was entirely focused on DID creation. This is how it&nbsp;went.</p><p>First off, let me say that I tried DIDKit not only because I wanted to see how another tool worked but because when using Veramo there is no way via the CLI to get the private key for a DID I created. I suspect with enough magic it could be retrieved via JavaScript, but maybe not. It’s locked away in a key management system&nbsp;(KMS).</p><p>Secondly, I found <a href="https://mhrsntrk.com/blog/create-and-publish-your-own-did-web">Create and Post Your Own did:web</a> post to be easier to navigate than the directions on the SpruceID site. I did find somewhere in the DIDKit docs how to create a did:web from their did:key generation command but can’t find it again which only goes to show how difficult it is to find some information in their documentation. (Since initially writing this I looked harder and did find it at “<a href="https://www.spruceid.dev/didkit/didkit-examples/did-web-in-minutes">did-web in minutes</a>”)Although SpruceID says it supports did:web it seems that it can resolve did:web but it doesn’t create a did:web fully. You must create a did:key and make some edits on it to make it into a did:web. The edits are minor, but I consider this a weird limitation. I read somewhere along the way that it only supports the ED25519 curve in creating did:key/did:web, but I am not sure if that limitation referred only to creation or resolving as&nbsp;well.</p><p>Once I created a JSON Web Key (JWK) using one of their key generation functions, built the did:key from the key, edited it to be a did:web, and published it to <a href="http://manicprogrammer.github.io/.well-known/did.json">manicprogrammer.github.io/.well-known/did.json</a> it resolved fine with their “didkit did-resolve” command.</p><p>Unlike the Veramo tool, I found no way through the CLI to add services so I just manually added a DIDComm service to the DID. As with my Veramo post let me say — don’t message me on that DIDComm service as I don’t have nor have I found a mobile device agent/wallet to which I can add an existing DID and mediator endpoints for DIDComm much less the DIDComm v2 endpoint I gave it. So I can’t get the messages. Even <a href="https://blocktrust.dev/">blocktrust.dev</a> which has the mediator doesn’t have such a thing. Perhaps I’ll setup a browser based DIDComm messaging app to test it out if I can find a DIDComm V2 set of libraries for the browser. (I’ll have to get proficient with JavaScript though, which I have never found the time to do.) Why do I have the endpoint in the DID then? Just for fun to see that I could add one and it properly resolve. Obviously, I have not been able to test&nbsp;it.</p><p>What else did I find in my experience with DIDKit? In the <a href="https://www.spruceid.dev/didkit/didkit-packages/command-line-interface">documentation</a>, I couldn’t find what the below ‘key” parameter did. But, following the directions to create a did:key the below command&nbsp;worked:</p> didkit key-to-did key -k issuer_key.jwk <p>I also found that on its Github it doesn’t have a discussion section.</p><p>All in all, the toolkit did a good job from the CLI. I am likely to try out the creation of a VC with it. It has packages for Rust (in which DIDKit is written), C, Java/Android, Python, and Javascript.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I messed around with the <a href="https://veramo.io/">Veramo</a> project for #verifiablecredentials. It’s not ready for prime time nor is it professed to be, but it does get some things done. I focused on DIDs. I was entirely using the CLI as javascript is not a “native” language for me but I may decide to get into that space to mess with this project some. The deficiencies I ran into may be CLI specific and not present when using the APIs directly.</p><p>I did get a well-formed DID out of it that I published at:</p> did:web:manicprogrammer.github.io <p>Don’t send me a didcomm message via it despite it having a service for that defined as I don’t currently have a personal agent setup to communicate via that service. I know, why publish the service then? For fun. Maybe I’ll remove&nbsp;it.</p><p>One issue I hit with the CLI that was especially off-putting to me is that I found no way to get the private key via the CLI for the created DID, even with the did export function (perhaps I am wrong, but I didn’t see it and thus wonder what the value of the export is). If someone finds me wrong let me know. &lt;EDIT&gt;: since writing this I have prompted a question about it and confirmed what I found. See <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/veramo/discussions/1303">here</a>.&lt;/EDIT&gt; It uses by default a local KMS. This means I can only create and send credentials created by Veramo as I don’t have the private key for signing via another method. I suppose I can get to it via some javascript magic and I may try to do that or else I’ll likely create a different did with keys I have generated in other&nbsp;ways.</p><p>All in all. It was worthwhile to play with from the CLI. No doubt, the real value is in the Javascript APIs. What’s it good for? I don’t really know yet. It’s good for messing around and becoming more familiar with verifiable credential structure, verifiable presentation structure, DID structure etc.</p><p>#decentralizedidentity #verifiablecredentials</p>

<p>There is some major positive good news for the KERI &amp; ACDC ecosystem. The European Banking Authority <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7141124705410818048/">announced on LinkedIn</a> the EBA Pillar 3 data hub which is built on KERI &amp; ACDC. The Pillar 3 data hub uses the vLEI system developed by <a href="https://gleif.org/">GLEIF</a>, the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation.</p>



 vLEI System Architecture Diagram: 


 
 


 What this means 



<p>This means that around 6000 financial institutions in the EU will now be required to use the EBA Pillar 3 data hub, and by extension KERI &amp; ACDC, for their financial reporting. You can read more in their <a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-publishes-discussion-paper-centralisation-eea-banks">website announcement</a> and the <a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-12/d5b13b4d-a9dc-4680-8b7c-0a3a4c694fac/Discussion%20paper%20on%20Pillar3%20data%20hub.pdf">linked report PDF</a>.<br><br>The important parts include pages 50-52, specifically the Garner analysis in section 6.3.128: </p>



 
 EBA had Gartner analyze KERI &amp; ACDC 



 found ” that there are no comparably efficient alternative solutions globally” 
 



<p>And section 6.4.130 Conclusion: </p>



 
 “vLEI effectively meets…Pillar 3 reporting requirements…perceived as a low-risk project overall…significant opportunity to enhance integrity of reporting processes” 
 



<p>A number of advantages and risks were identified with the paper saying </p>



<blockquote>
<p>The automation of identity verification and related processes through the vLEI could also offer numerous potential advantages for both Financial Institutions and other Regulators in the EU financial market<br></p>
<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-12/d5b13b4d-a9dc-4680-8b7c-0a3a4c694fac/Discussion%20paper%20on%20Pillar3%20data%20hub.pdf">https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-12/d5b13b4d-a9dc-4680-8b7c-0a3a4c694fac/Discussion%20paper%20on%20Pillar3%20data%20hub.pdf</a></blockquote>



<p>Potential Advantages:</p>



 
 For Financial Institutions
 
 Non-repudiable identification 
 
 This means once you say something with KERI you can’t un-say it, as in you can’t change your story without getting caught 
 
 



 Operational efficiency: unified digital format 



 Enhanced products and services: trusted information enables risk management, customer service, and enhanced online experience 
 
 



 For Supervisors/Regulators
 
 Enhanced Trust: simplify both validation of regulatory reports and authorized sign off 



 Comprehensive Entity Overview: transparent, aggregated view of legal entities and hierarchies 



 Standardization of Data Processes: smarter, more cost-effective, reliable data workflows 
 
 
 



<p>Risks:</p>



 
 Development of ecosystem
 
 Due to ecosystem novelty there is only one QVI right now (Provenant), 
 
 Support is needed from GLEIF to grow the population of QVIs, incentive structure, and ecosystem orchestration 
 
 



 Ensure adequate support to institutions
 
 End-user applications bank wallet 



 Wallet for reporting institutions 



 Compatibility with eIDAS 2.0 framework 



 User-friendly applications for digital signatures, key management, and logging services 
 
 



 Market’s recognition of benefits offered by vLEI
 
 Pillar 3 reporting requirement could trigger a “snowball effect” to catalyze market recognition of vLEI benefits. 
 
 
 
 
 



<p>This is an exciting development in the KERI space that this blog will continue to track.</p>

<p>Interoperability is a grand goal, and a tough problem to crack. After all, what is interoperability other than independent things just working out of the box? In the standards and specifications world, we have to be precise about a lot of things, but none more precise than what we expect to be interoperable with, and how we get to the interop&nbsp;point.</p><p>In my experience, there are a few common ways to get&nbsp;there.</p> Conformance <p>The easiest way to achieve interoperability is for there to be no choice from the implementations. If there’s only one option, and implementations are motivated to follow that option, then interoperability is much easier to count on. If a specification has a MUST, and means it, you can realistically rely on that being followed by well-meaning developers.</p><p>This zero-level interoperability is not without its confusion, though. In any specification, there are a lot of assumptions that lead up to a MUST being placed. Changes in this context could make that MUST behave differently in between implementations. For example, taking the byte value of a data structure, even a simple one like a string or number, assumes an encoding and order for that data structure. What’s most dangerous about this kind of problem is that it’s easy for multiple developers to make the same assumptions and therefore assure themselves that the MUST as written is sufficient, until someone else comes along with different assumptions and everything breaks in spite of seeming to be conformant.</p><p>To give a concrete example, try asking anyone for a USB cable and chances are you’ll get a few different varieties back, from type A, to type C, to micro-B, to power-only varieties. All of them are USB and conform to all aspects of the cabling standard, but “USB” is not sufficient to ensure compatibility on a physical&nbsp;level.</p><p>Even with its limitations, it’s still a good idea for specifications to be specific as much as possible. But the world can’t always make a single choice and stick to it. Things start to get more interesting when there’s choice between options, though, so how do we handle&nbsp;that?</p> Discovery <p>If my system can ask your system which options it supports ahead of time, then ostensibly I should be able to pick one of those options and expect it to work. Many standard internet APIs are based around this concept, with an initial discovery phase that sets the parameters of interoperability for future connections.</p><p>This pattern works fairly well, at least for common options and happy paths. If your system supports some or all of what my system wants, then I can probably figure out how to connect to you successfully. If your system doesn’t support what I need, then at least I know I can’t start the process. OpenID Connect usually works from a discovery-based process, where the RP fetches the IdP’s discovery document prior to connecting.</p><p>The discovery pattern is predicated on an agreement of how to do discovery in the first place. I need to at least know how to make an initial call in order to figure out what the options are for all future calls. This is expected to be out of band for the rest of the protocol, but is often built on the same underlying assumptions. Does the protocol assume HTTP as a transport? Then discovery can use that,&nbsp;also.</p><p>Discovery is generally done without context, though. The existence of something in a discovery step does not guarantee that it will be usable in the context of a real request. A server might support seven different cryptographic algorithms, but might only allow some of them to specific clients or request types. That kind of detail is hard to capture through discovery.</p><p>For a physical example, let’s say that before you ask for a USB cable, you can check a list of all the available types that the person you’re asking has available. That way when you ask for a specific cable, you’ll at least know that they had it as an option. But maybe they only had one and already lent it out to someone else, or they only hand out power-only cables to people they haven’t met before, in case the cable goes walkabout.</p> Negotiation <p>If we can instead bake the discovery process into the protocol itself, we can end up with a negotiation pattern. One party makes a request that includes the options that they’re capable of, and the other party responds with their own set of options, or chooses from the first set. From there, both parties now know the parameters the need to&nbsp;connect.</p><p>This kind of option works well with connection-focused protocols, and it has the distinct advantage of avoiding an additional round trip to do discovery. There’s also no longer a need to specify a separate process for discovery, since it’s baked in to the protocol itself. Content negotiation in HTTP, algorithm selection in TLS, and grant negotiation in GNAP all follow this&nbsp;pattern.</p><p>Negotiation falls short when decisions have to be made about the initial connection, much like when there’s a separate discovery call. The protocol can be built to robustly account for those failures, such as a content type being unavailable in HTTP, but the ability to negotiate does not guarantee satisfactory results. Negotiation can also end up with less than ideal results when there’s not a clear preference order, but in such cases it’s possible for a negotiation to continue over several round&nbsp;trips.</p><p>If you need a USB cable, you can walk up to someone and say “Hi, can I borrow a USB cable? I need it to be USB-A or USB-C and I need it for a data connection.” The person you’re asking can then see if they have anything that fits your criteria, and choose appropriately from their supply. If they hand you something that’s less than ideal, you can clarify “I’d really prefer USB-C if you have it, but this will work if&nbsp;not”.</p> Configuration <p>On a simpler level, many developers simply want to choose an option and run with it, and if the other side makes a compatible choice, this can short-circuit any kind of discovery or negotiation process in a positive way. This might seem magical, but it happens way more often than many software architects and standards authors like to admit. It’s not uncommon for two developers to make similar assumptions, or for libraries to influence each others’ implementations such that they end up doing the same thing even without any external agreement to do&nbsp;so.</p><p>If a developer codes up something based on an example, and it works, that developer is not likely to look beyond the example. Why would they? The goal is to get something to connect, and if it does, then that job is done and they can move on to more interesting problems. And if it doesn’t work? Chance are they’ll tweak the piece that doesn’t work until it does&nbsp;work.</p><p>JSON works this way in practice, with well-formed JSON being the interoperability expectation and anything else being, effectively, schema-by-fiat. While there are schema languages on top of JSON, the practical truth is that applications apply their own internal schema-like expectations to the JSON by looking for a field with a certain name in a certain place with a data value that parses how they expect it to. Anything that runs afoul of that is an error not of JSON but for the application to deal with. This is a far cry from the days of XML, which expected processing of namespaces and schemas to make sense of tags at the parsing level. Was it more robust? Arguably, yes. But it was also far too heavy for an average developer to care about. JSON’s approach lets us get to data exchange simply by letting us get it right by accident most of the time, and ignoring things that don’t make&nbsp;sense.</p><p>If you want a USB-C cable but just ask someone for a USB cable, and they hand you a USB-C cable, everyone’s happy. You may have been accidentally interoperable with your request and response, but there’s power in that kind of accident and the frequency with which it&nbsp;happens.</p> Practicality <p>All of these interoperability methods have merit, and most systems are built out of a combination of all of them in one way or another. When we’re defining what interoperability means, we always need to take in the context of what is interoperable, for whom, and when.At the end of the day, practical interoperability means that things connect well enough to get stuff done. We should endeavor to build our standards and systems to allow for robust discovery and negotiation, but always keep in mind that developers will find the best path for them to&nbsp;connect.</p><p>Interoperability is a grand goal indeed, and while a lot of the time we stumble backwards into it, there are well-trodden paths for getting&nbsp;there.</p>

Bing Create’s visual answer to the prompt, “A world of open source software and hardware.”
<p>After 17 years and 761 episodes, <a href="https://twit.tv/shows/floss-weekly">FLOSS Weekly</a> ended its run on the <a href="https://twit.tv/">TWiT network</a> yesterday. I hosted the last 179 of those shows. My career as a professional (meaning paid) advocate of open source also ended with that show.&nbsp;The full span ran from 1996, when I first appeared on the Linux Journal masthead, until yesterday: about 27 years.</p>
<p>I still participate in <a href="https://www.cluetrain.com/book/markets.html">market conversations</a> around the many topics I covered in that span, but I’m mostly working on other stuff now. For example, in random-ish order:</p>
 
 <a href="https://doc.searls.com/news-commons/">a commons-based approach to news,</a> 
 <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2023/08/18/we-need-deep-news/">a history (and archive) based approach to journalism</a> in the Digital Age, 
 the Digital Age itself (such as <a href="https://dsearls.medium.com/what-does-the-internet-make-of-us-118421ac5e">what we make of digital tech and the Internet, and what they make of us</a>), 
 blogging, such as in my three blogs here (this one, plus <a href="https:/projectvrm.org">ProjectVRM</a> and <a href="http://trunkli.org">Trunkline</a>), and supporting what <a href="http://scripting.com">Dave Winer</a> is doing with <a href="https://feedland.com/?username=doc1">Feedland</a> and allied work, 
 <a href="https://customercommons.org/solutions/tools/byway/byway-faq/">freeing e-commerce</a> from the grips of giants like Amazon, 
 <a href="https://doc.searls.com/the-adblock-war/">fighting surveillance online and off,</a> 
 <a href="http://iiworkshop.org">self-sovereign identity,</a> 
 <a href="https://trunkli.org">infrastructure</a> old, new, and in the future, 
 <a href="https://worldofends.com/">saving the Internet</a>, and 
 <a href="http://projectvrm.org">making</a>&nbsp;an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Intention-Economy-When-Customers-Charge/dp/1422158527/">intention economy</a> happen. 
 
<p>All of those are cars in a <a href="http://cluetrain.com">cluetrain</a>, about which more below.</p>
<p>They are also featured now and then on <a href="http://reality2cast.cm">Reality 2.o</a>, the podcast <a href="https://katherinedruckman.com/">Katherine Druckman</a> and I have been doing since our Linux Journal days.</p>
<p>For many decades now, I’ve been spoiled by success. For example, open source, an expression whose current meaning <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030412171505/http://www.catb.org/~esr/open-source.html">was born in 1998</a>, is now beyond huge. <a href="https://venturebeat.com/programming-development/github-releases-open-source-report-octoverse-2022-says-97-of-apps-use-oss/">Here’s VentureBeat</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today,&nbsp;<a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/06/18/what-is-open-source/">open-source software</a>&nbsp;underpins almost everything: A whopping&nbsp;<a href="https://www.synopsys.com/software-integrity/resources/analyst-reports/open-source-security-risk-analysis.html?intcmp=sig-blog-ossra22">97% of applications</a>&nbsp;leverage open-source code, and 90% of companies are applying or using it in some way.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>&nbsp;alone had 413 million open-source software (OSS) contributions in 2022.</p>
<p>“Open-source software is the foundation of 99% of the world’s software,” said Martin Woodward, VP of developer relations at GitHub.</p></blockquote>
<p>By covering open source for Linux Journal from the start, I helped make that happen.</p>
<p>Same with <a href="https://cluetrain.com/">The Cluetrain Manifesto</a>. “Markets are conversations,” a one-liner of mine that became the first thesis in the manifesto, grew to become a meme that <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22markets+are+conversations%22">hasn’t gone away</a>. The word cluetrain also appears <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=cluetrain&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live">almost daily</a> in tweets on X, almost a quarter century after it was coined. (When Twitter was still itself, cluetrain was mentioned in tweets several times daily. The decline in cluetrain mentions is one small measure of how lame X has become.)</p>
<p>Also blogging!</p>
<p>Hmmm… I don’t think I ever blogged about my only encounter with Robin Williams. It was at some trade show in the early aughts. There was a scrum of attendees gathered around something or someone unseen in the middle. On the periphery was my old friend <a href="https://tomrielly.com/">Tom Rielly</a>, who quickly grabbed me and pulled me into the middle of the crowd, where stood Robin Williams, with two bags of swag. I almost said, “Hey, you look like Robin Williams, only shorter.” Then Tom introduced me, saying “This is Doc. He’s one of the top five bloggers in the world.” I said, “More like one of the top sixteen, but most of the others are duplicates.” Robin then said something funny, and I responded with something funny of my own, and an all-funny exchange ensued during which my separate self said, “Holy shit! I’m doing humor schtick with Robin Williams and holding my own!” After maybe half a minute of this, I excused myself, saying something like, “I’ll leave you to your private audience here,” and exited the crowd.</p>
<p>Oh, and photography. As of this moment, my photos have had 16,855,107 views on <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/docsearls/">one Flickr account,</a> and 1,470,281 on <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/infrastructure/">the other</a>. Visits to those run from the hundreds to thousands per day. A <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?search=%22Doc+Searls%22&amp;title=Special:MediaSearch&amp;go=Go&amp;type=image">search for my name on Wikimedia Commons</a> also brings up 1850 results, nearly all of which are photos I’ve shared using Creative Commons licensing that encourages use and re-use, which is why many (or most) of them find their way into Wikipedia articles.</p>
<p>I’ve had less luck with the other missions I’ve listed above. But I believe in all of them, and in faith, I truck onward.</p>
<p>By the way, FLOSS Weekly has not slipped below the waves. I expect it will be picked up somewhere else on the Web, and wherever you get your podcasts. (I love that expression because it means podcasting isn’t walled into some giant’s garden.) When FLOSS Weekly becomes re-manifest, I’ll point to it here.</p>

<p>Der Europaabgeordnete der Piratenpartei Dr. Patrick Breyer, digitaler Freiheitskämpfer und Mitverhandler des europäischen Pendants des heute beschlossenen Gesetzes zur Digitalisierung des Gesundheitswesens, kritisiert das deutsche Gesetz:</p>



<p>„Dass künftig ohne Zustimmung der Bürger all ihre Behandlungen und Krankheiten in einer fernabrufbaren elektronischen Patientenakte zusammengeführt und weitergegeben werden sollen, hebelt im Profitinteresse des ‚Pharmastandorts‘ Deutschland das Arztgeheimnis aus. Das Arztgeheimnis schützt uns davor, dass wir aus Scham oder Sorge um unseren Ruf z.B. vor einer Paartherapie oder Entzugstherapie zurückschrecken. Mit dem heutigen Tag geht das Arztgeheimnis für alle verloren, die sich nicht wehren oder nicht wehren können – ein rücksichtsloses und gerade Sozialdemokraten unwürdiges Vorgehen. So sensible Informationen wie sexuelle oder psychische Krankheiten und Störungen gehen auch behandelte Ärzte nicht ungefragt etwas an.</p>



<p>Minister Lauterbach weiß genau, dass Widerspruchsrechte eine faire Wahlmöglichkeit nur vortäuschen, kaum genutzt werden und diskriminieren. Für viele Patienten, die nicht privilegiert sind, die wenig Zeit haben, deren Sprachkenntnisse oder Bildung begrenzt sind oder die älter sind, ist es eine zu hohe Hürde, bei einer bestimmten Behörde oder digital aktiv widersprechen zu müssen. Jede Webseite fragt uns nach unserer Einwilligung, aber ausgerechnet unsere Patientenakten sollen ohne unsere Zustimmung der Industrie offen stehen? Nach einer Umfrage in <a href="https://www.greens-efa.eu/files/assets/docs/ehds_survey_report.pdf">meinem Auftrag wollen 74% der Bürgerinnen und Bürger vor der Weitergabe ihrer Patientenakte an Forscher um Einwilligung gefragt werden.</a> Das fordert auch die Helsinki-Erklärung des Weltärztebundes.</p>



<p>Die Piratenpartei plant, eine geeignete Unterstützung zur Aufklärung und einfachen Ausübung der Widerspruchsrechte zur Verfügung zu stellen. Für uns muss die Kontrolle jedes Menschen über sein Privatleben einschließlich seiner Gesundheit im Mittelpunkt der Gestaltung der digitalen Revolution stehen, nicht das Profitinteresse der Industrie.“</p>

<p>Die Abgeordneten des EU-Parlaments <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meetdocs/2014_2019/plmrep/COMMITTEES/CJ43/AMC/2023/11-28/Item4-EHDS-compromiseamendments_EN.pdf">haben heute im Plenum mit großer Mehrheit für die Schaffung eines “Europäischen Raums für Gesundheitsdaten” gestimmt.</a> Dieser Raum soll Informationen über sämtliche ärztliche Behandlungen eines Bürgers in einer europaweit vernetzten und fernabrufbaren elektronischen Patientenakte zusammenführen – erstmals auch für privat Versicherte. Dank eines Änderungsantrags des digitalen Freiheitskämpfers Dr. Patrick Breyer (Piratenpartei), gemeinsam mit Abgeordneten von SPD, Grünen und Linken, stimmte in letzter Sekunde eine Parlamentsmehrheit für die Absicherung des in Deutschland geplanten Widerspruchsrechts gegen eine elektronische Patientenakte. Der endgültige Gesetzeswortlaut muss aber noch mit den EU-Regierungen ausgehandelt werden, die bislang kein Widerspruchsrecht gegen die Datensammlung festschreiben wollen. Keine Mehrheit fanden dagegen Änderungsanträge Breyers, denen zufolge Patienten vor Zugriffen auf ihre Patientendaten durch Ärzte oder Forschern gefragt werden sollten.</p>



<p>„Eine Zwangs-elektronische Patientenakte mit europaweiter Zugriffsmöglichkeit zieht unverantwortliche Risiken des Diebstahls, Hacks oder Verlustes persönlichster Behandlungsdaten nach sich und droht Patienten jeder Kontrolle über die Sammlung ihrer Krankheiten und Störungen zu berauben“, unterstreicht Dr. Patrick Breyer, Europaabgeordneter der Piratenpartei, Datenschutzexperte und Mitverhandlungsführer der Fraktion Grüne/Europäische Freie Allianz im Innenausschuss des EU-Parlaments. „Das ist nichts anderes als das Ende des Arztgeheimnisses. Haben wir nichts aus den internationalen Hackerangriffen auf Krankenhäuser und andere Gesundheitsdaten gelernt? Wenn jede psychische Krankheit, Suchttherapie, jede Potenzschwäche und alle Schwangerschaftsabbrüche zwangsvernetzt werden, drohen besorgte Patienten von dringender medizinischer Behandlung abgeschreckt zu werden – das kann Menschen krank machen und ihre Familien belasten! In den Trilogverhandlungen werde ich dafür kämpfen, dass diese drohende digitale Entmündigung entsprechend dem Willen der Volksvertreter eindeutig ausgeschlossen wird.“</p>



<p>Anja Hirschel, Spitzenkandidatin der Piratenpartei für die Europawahl 2024, kommentiert: “Eine zentrale Datenspeicherung weckt Begehrlichkeiten in verschiedenste Richtungen. Wir sprechen dabei allerdings nicht nur von Hackerangriffen, sondern von der sogenannten Sekundärnutzung. Diese bezeichnet Zugriffe, die zu Forschungszwecke vollumfänglich gewährt werden sollen. Die Patientendaten sollen dann an Dritte weitergegeben werden. Aus Datenschutzsicht ist bereits das zentrale Ansammeln problematisch, bei Weitergabe wenigstens ein Opt-In Verfahren (aktive Einwilligung) richtig. Dies würde eine gewisse Entscheidungshoheit jedes Menschen über die persönlichen Daten ermöglichen. Wird allerdings nicht einmal ein Opt-Out Verfahren (aktiver Widerspruch) etabliert, so bedeutet dies letztlich die Abschaffung der Vertraulichkeit jeglicher medizinischer Information. Und das obwohl Ärzte in Deutschland gemäß § 203 StGB berufsständisch zurecht der Schweigepflicht unterliegen, wie u.a. auch Rechtsanwälte. Dieser Schutz unserer privatesten Informationen und das Recht auf vertrauliche Versorgung und Beratung stehen jetzt auf dem Spiel.”</p>



<p>In der Endabstimmung votierte Breyer gegen den Gesetzentwurf. Keine Mehrheit gefunden hatten nämlich <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/European-Health-Data-Space-Plenary-AMs2.pdf">weitere Änderungsanträge von Breyer und Abgeordneten der Grünen und Linken zu der auch von der Bundesregierung geplanten Regel</a>, dass Patienten künftig aktiv widersprechen müssen, um zu verhindern, dass Gesundheitsdienstleister und Forscher ihre Behandlungsakten einsehen können. Die Bürgerinnen und Bürger sollen weder um Einwilligung noch mündlich überhaupt nach ihrem Willen gefragt werden. Breyer: „Für viele Patienten, die wenig Zeit oder begrenzte Sprachkenntnisse haben oder älter sind, ist es zu kompliziert, schriftlich bei einer bestimmten Behörde oder über digitale Kanäle widersprechen zu müssen. Internationale Standards wie der Internationale Kodex für medizinische Ethik des Weltärztebundes oder die Erklärung von Helsinki über die ethischen Grundsätze der medizinischen Forschung verlangen bisher, dass vor der Weitergabe medizinischer Informationen die Zustimmung des Patienten eingeholt wird. <a href="https://www.greens-efa.eu/files/assets/docs/ehds_survey_report.pdf">Eine von uns in Auftrag gegebene Meinungsumfrage</a> bestätigt, dass die Bürgerinnen und Bürger erwarten, dass sie um ihre Zustimmung gebeten werden, bevor ihre Gesundheitsdaten weitergegeben werden. Jede Website fragt uns um Erlaubnis, bevor sie ein Cookie setzt, aber wir sollen nicht einmal gefragt werden, bevor unsere Gesundheitsdaten weitergegeben werden? Dieses System entzieht den Patienten die Kontrolle über ihre Daten und ist nicht akzeptabel.“  </p>



<p>Eine <a href="https://www.beuc.eu/sites/default/files/publications/BEUC-X-2023-051_consumer_attitudes_to_health_data.pdf">Umfrage der Europäischen Verbraucherzentralen (BEUC)</a> hat ergeben, dass 44% der Bürger Sorgen vor Diebstahl ihrer Gesundheitsdaten haben; 40% befürchten unbefugte Datenzugriffe.</p>



<p>Bereits morgen soll die erste Verhandlungsrunde zwischen EU-Rat, EU-Parlament und EU-Kommission stattfinden. Der Parlamentsberichterstatter will die Verhandlungen noch 2024 abschließen. </p>

<p>This article shows how a Blazor application can be implemented in a secure way using MudBlazor UI components and Microsoft Entra ID as an identity provider. The MudBlazor UI components adds some inline styles and requires a specific CSP setup due to this and the Blazor WASM script requirements. </p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/MicrosoftEntraIDMudBlazor">https://github.com/damienbod/MicrosoftEntraIDMudBlazor</a></p>



<p></p>



 Setup 



<p>The application is setup using a Blazor WASM UI hosted in an ASP.NET Core application. The MudBlazor Nuget package was added to client project. Some MudBlazor components were added to the UI using MudBlazor <a href="https://mudblazor.com/docs/overview">documentation</a>.</p>







<p></p>



 Security Headers 



<p>The security headers need to be added to protect the session of the web application. I use NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders to implement the headers. We can protect the UI using CSP nonces and so the NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders.TagHelpers Nuget package is also used. The following packages are added to the server project. </p>



 
 NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders 



 NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders.TagHelpers 
 



<p></p>



<p>The SecurityHeadersDefinitions class adds the security headers as best possible for this technical setup. A nonce is used in the CSP for the scripts tag. The ‘unsafe-eval’ value is added to the script CSP definition due to the Blazor WASM technical setup. This reduces the security protections. The unsafe inline is added as a fallback for older browsers. The style CSP definition allows unsafe inline due to the MudBlazor UI components.</p>


  namespace MicrosoftEntraIdMudBlazor.Server;

public static class SecurityHeadersDefinitions
{
    public static HeaderPolicyCollection GetHeaderPolicyCollection(bool isDev, string? idpHost)
    {
        if(idpHost == null)

<p>The UseSecurityHeaders adds the security headers middleware.</p>


  app.UseSecurityHeaders(SecurityHeadersDefinitions
    .GetHeaderPolicyCollection(env.IsDevelopment(),

<p></p>



<p>A nonce is used to protect the UI application and the tag helpers are used for this.</p>

<p>Im Vorfeld der morgigen Abstimmung des Europäischen Parlaments über die Schaffung eines Europäischen Gesundheitsdatenraums und über Änderungsanträge zur Verhinderung eines Zwangs zur europäischen Patientenakte hielt der Europaabgeordnete der Piratenpartei Dr. Patrick Breyer in der heutigen Plenardebatte folgende Rede:</p>



<p>„Frau Präsidentin, Frau Kommissarin, verehrte Kollegen.</p>



<p>Wir sind Volksvertreter. Aus Umfragen wissen wir: Die Menschen wollen nicht, dass ungefragt jegliche Behandlung, alle unsere körperlichen und psychischen Störungen in einer europaweit vernetzten elektronischen Patientenakte gesammelt und Sicherheitsrisiken ausgesetzt werden, wie Sie es planen. Einen Zwang zur elektronischen Patientenakte darf es nicht geben!</p>



<p>Die Bürger/innen wollen mehrheitlich auch nicht, dass unsere Ärzte ungefragt unsere komplette Krankengeschichte, von psychischen Störungen bis hin zu Schwangerschaftsabbrüchen und Potenzproblemen, am PC einsehen können. Eine ePA kann Vorteile haben, aber als Pirat ist meine Überzeugung: Niemand hat das Recht, besser zu wissen, was gut für mich und meine Gesundheit ist, als ich selbst.</p>



<p>Mehr als 2/3 der Europäerinnen und Europäer lehnen es ab, dass die Industrie ohne unsere Einwilligung zur Produktentwicklung auch unsere nicht-anonymisierten Gesundheitsdaten wie Psychotherapieakten einsehen kann, wie Sie es wollen. Warum fragen Sie die Patienten nicht nach ihrem Willen?</p>



<p>Sie wollen im Profitinteresse der Industrie faktisch das Arztgeheimnis aushebeln, das uns davor schützt, dass wir aus Scham oder Sorge um unseren Ruf z.B. vor einer Paartherapie oder Entzugstherapie zurückschrecken. Wissen Sie eigentlich, was Sie Familien damit antun?</p>



<p>Hören Sie auf uns einreden zu wollen, dass eine gute Versorgung oder Forschung nur durch eine solche Entmündigung der Patienten möglich wären. Unsere Änderungsanträge zeigen, wie Fortschritt und Respekt vor dem Patientenwillen Hand in Hand gehen können.</p>



<p>Es muss dabei bleiben: Meine körperliche und psychische Gesundheit ist meine Sache. Meine Gesundheitsdaten gehören mir. Respektieren Sie das!“</p>



<p>Hintergrund: Zur morgigen <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/bundesregierung-unterstuetzt-eu-weite-patientendatenvernetzung-ehds-europaabgeordnete-wollen-zwang-zur-vernetzten-elektronischen-patientenakte-fuer-alle-stoppen/">Abstimmung beantragen Europaabgeordnete Änderungen, um einen Zwang zur europaweit vernetzten elektronischen Patientenakte zu verhindern und die Kontrolle der Patienten über ihre Behandlungsdaten zu sichern.</a> Das EU-Gesetz zum Gesundheitsdatenraum soll Ärzte verpflichten, eine Zusammenfassung jeder Behandlung eines Patienten in das europaweit vernetzte System einzustellen. Es gibt die Sorge, der Gesundheitsdatenraum könnte damit das Widerspruchsrecht gegen die elektronische Patientenakte aushebeln. Ausnahmen oder ein Widerspruchsrecht sind in der geplanten EU-Verordnung auch für besonders sensible Krankheiten und Therapien wie psychische Störungen, sexuelle Krankheiten und Störungen wie Potenzschwäche oder Unfruchtbarkeit, HIV oder Suchttherapien nicht vorgesehen. Der Patient soll nur Zugriffen auf seine elektronische Patientenakte durch andere Gesundheitsdienstleister oder die Industrie widersprechen können. Wie ein Widerspruch erfolgen soll, ist nicht geregelt. Eine Umfrage der Europäischen Verbraucherzentralen (BEUC) hat ergeben, dass 44% der Bürger Sorgen vor Diebstahl ihrer Gesundheitsdaten haben; 40% befürchten unbefugte Datenzugriffe.</p>



<p>Morgen soll das Plenum des Europäischen Parlaments abstimmen und kann letzte Änderungen vornehmen. Bereits am Donnerstag soll die erste Verhandlungsrunde zwischen EU-Rat, EU-Parlament und EU-Kommission stattfinden. Der Berichterstatter will die Verhandlungen noch vor der Europawahl 2024 abschließen.</p>

<p>Then, some villages attract trade, and people, and they grow and turn into towns.
The creates the opportunities for some skilled individuals to specialize in a particular
trade, and get good at it: long-distance trade (like in Venice), cloth-making (like
Ghent) and many others. Prosperity increases, and an actual economy replaces subsistence
farming in the newly prosperous towns.</p>
<p>Political demands soon follow, and over some period of time, more and more cities and
towns manage to free themselves from the rule of the local lord and rule themselves instead.
They could do that because their trades enable them to be prosperous without without

<p>Fast-forward to the 21st century. The internet is dominated by a small set of
platforms that practice what has often be described as digital feudalism: the platforms
control the equivalent of the land (social media, mostly), which is required for their
subjects (the users)</p>

ruminating for years about women’s contributions to the domestic
economy, the massive time investment of producing clothing for a
family, and the comparative properties of different textile
fibers. These research interests were informed by a lifetime of sewing
and other fiber crafts. None of this experience, however, properly
prepared her to face the reality of needing to rely on her own hands
to provide large portions of her own wardrobe.</p><p>Guest co-host Juliana Sims sits down with Morgan to talk about how,
in the wake of a recently developed allergy to synthetic fabrics, she
now finds herself putting that knowledge of historical textile
production to use to produce clothing that she can wear.</p><p>Links and other notes:</p>  Morgan presented this as a (much shorter) talk at the <a href="https://dressconference.org/">Dress Conference 2023</a>  <a>Slides from the presentation</a>  <a href="https://mlemmer.org/dissertation/">Morgan's Dissertation</a>, which we <a href="https://fossandcrafts.org/episodes/34-women-and-wool-working-part1.html">also</a> <a href="https://fossandcrafts.org/episodes/35-women-and-wool-working-part2.html">covered</a>  <a href="https://mlemmer.org/blog/RSIgloves/">RSI Glove Pattern</a>  <p>The quote that Morgan somewhat misremembered about a woman preparing
wool before the winter:</p><blockquote><p>"A thrifty countrywoman had a small croft, she and her sturdy spouse. He tilled his own land, whether the work called for the plough, or the curved sickle, or the hoe. She would now sweep the cottage, supported on props; now she would set the eggs to be hatched under the plumage of the brooding hen; or she gathered green mallows or white mushrooms, or warmed the low hearth with welcome fire. And yet she diligently employed her hands at the loom, and armed herself against the threats of winter." -- Ovid, Fasti 4.687-714</p></blockquote>

<p>Anlässlich der gestrigen Einigung auf den Inhalt des künftigen KI-Gesetzes der EU warnt der digitale Freiheitskämpfer und Europaabgeordnete Dr. Patrick Breyer (Piratenpartei) davor, dass das Gesetz den Weg für die Einführung biometrischer Massenüberwachung in Europa freimacht. Das neue Gesetz <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/de/press-room/20231206IPR15699/artificial-intelligence-act-deal-on-comprehensive-rules-for-trustworthy-ai">lässt Echtzeit-Gesichtserkennung im öffentlichen Raum etwa zur Suche nach Verdächtigen und Opfern von Straftaten zu</a>, wenn ein EU-Mitgliedsstaat dies beschließt. Breyer dazu:</p>



<p>“Einer gesucht, alle überwacht? Mit dieser gesetzlichen Anleitung zu biometrischer Massenüberwachung kann unser Gesicht in der Öffentlichkeit immer und überall flächendeckend und verdachtslos gescannt werden. Die vermeintlichen Ausnahmen sind Augenwischerei – ständig sind doch Tausende Verdächtiger der im Gesetz genannten Straftaten durch Richterbeschluss gesucht. Unter ständiger Überwachung sind wir nicht mehr frei! In der Realität wurde mit biometrischer Massenüberwachung des öffentlichen Raums noch kein einziger Terrorist gefunden, kein einziger Anschlag verhindert, stattdessen führt sie zu unzähligen Festnahmen Unschuldiger und bis zu 99% Falschverdächtigungen. Das Gesetz legitimiert und normalisiert eine Kultur des Misstrauens. Es führt Europa in eine dystopische Zukunft eines misstrauischen High-Tech-Überwachungsstaats nach chinesischem Vorbild.</p>







<p>In der faktischen Erlaubnis zur flächendeckenden Massenüberwachung sehe ich eine Verletzung unseres Grundrechts auf Achtung unserer Privatsphäre. Gesetze, die verdachtslose Massenüberwachung erlauben, wurden von den Gerichten immer wieder wegen ihrer Unvereinbarkeit mit den Grundrechten für nichtig erklärt. Auch das neue KI-Gesetz ist ein Fall für die Gerichte. Kein Wunder, dass sich die Volksvertreter:innen bis zuletzt gegen diesen Dammbruch gesträubt haben, der das vom Parlament gewollte Verbot in eine ausdrückliche Erlaubnis biometrischer Massenüberwachung verkehrt.</p>



<p>Technologien zur biometrischen Massenüberwachung unserer öffentlicher Räume erfassen eine große Zahl unschuldiger Bürger:innen, diskriminieren systematisch unterrepräsentierte Gruppen und haben eine abschreckende Wirkung auf eine freie und vielfältige Gesellschaft. Mit Fehlerquoten (Falschmeldungen) von bis zu <a href="https://www.rwi-essen.de/presse/wissenschaftskommunikation/unstatistik">99 %</a> hat die ineffektive Gesichtsüberwachungstechnologie keine Ähnlichkeit mit der gezielten Suche, als die Regierungen sie darzustellen versuchen. In dem neuen Gesetz gibt es keinerlei Anforderungen an die Zuverlässigkeit der Suchalgorithmen, wie sie der Europarat <a href="https://edoc.coe.int/en/artificial-intelligence/9753-guidelines-on-facial-recognition.html">empfiehlt</a>. Wir müssen für eine Gesellschaft des Vertrauens und der Grundrechte eintreten, nicht für eine Gesellschaft des Misstrauens und der Spaltung. Massenüberwachung hat keinen Platz in unserer Gesellschaft. Diesem Gesetz zur Legitimierung von Massenüberwachung im öffentlichen Raum werde ich nicht zustimmen.”</p>



<p>Anja Hirschel, Spitzenkandidatin der Piratenpartei für die Europawahl 2024, fügt hinzu: „Wenn wir zulassen, dass eine Überwachungsinfrastruktur aufgebaut und entsprechende KI-Systeme trainiert werden, ist es erschreckend einfach, unsere gesamten Bewegungen und Begegnungen im Detail auszuspähen. In Zukunft können leicht die Einsatzzwecke, Speicherdauer und Zugriffsbefugnisse erweitert werden. Diese Regelungen öffnen die Büchse der Pandora!“</p>



<p>Laut einer repräsentativen Umfrage im Auftrag Breyers, die von YouGov in 10 EU-Ländern durchgeführt wurde, <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/umfrage-mehrheit-gegen-biometrische-massenueberwachung-im-oeffentlichen-raum/">lehnt eine deutliche Mehrheit der Europäer:innen biometrische Massenüberwachung im öffentlichen Raum ab</a>.</p>



<p>Der Europäische Datenschutzausschuss und der Europäische Datenschutzbeauftragte haben ein “generelles Verbot des Einsatzes von KI zur automatischen Erkennung menschlicher Merkmale in öffentlich zugänglichen Räumen” gefordert, da dies “direkte negative Auswirkungen auf die Ausübung der Meinungs-, Versammlungs- und Vereinigungsfreiheit sowie der Freizügigkeit” habe. Mehr als 200 zivilgesellschaftliche Organisationen, Aktivisten, Technikspezialisten und andere Experten auf der ganzen Welt setzen sich für ein weltweites Verbot biometrischer Erkennungstechnologien ein, die eine massenhafte und diskriminierende Überwachung ermöglichen. Sie argumentieren, dass “diese Instrumente die Fähigkeit haben, Menschen zu identifizieren, zu verfolgen, auszusondern und zu verfolgen, wo immer sie sich aufhalten, und damit unsere Menschenrechte und bürgerlichen Freiheiten untergraben”. Auch die UN-Hochkommissarin für Menschenrechte spricht sich gegen den Einsatz biometrischer Fernerkennungssysteme im öffentlichen Raum aus und verweist auf die “mangelnde Einhaltung von Datenschutzstandards”, “erhebliche Probleme mit der Genauigkeit” und “diskriminierende Auswirkungen”.</p>



<p>Das Europäische Parlament hatte sich im vergangenen Jahr noch für ein Verbot biometrischer Massenüberwachung ausgesprochen.</p>

<p>Der Europäische Gerichtshof wird künftig die von den Verfahrensbeteiligten eingereichten Schreiben und Argumente nach Verkündung eines Urteils proaktiv und systematisch auf seiner Internetseite veröffentlichen. Eine Ausnahme gilt bei Widerspruch des Verfassers eines Schriftsatzes, jedoch besteht in diesem Fall ein Recht auf Informationszugang über die EU-Kommission auf Antrag. Dies ist das Ergebnis der gestern <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/de/press/press-releases/2023/12/07/reform-of-the-statute-of-the-court-of-justice-council-and-parliament-negotiators-reach-provisional-agreement/">abgeschlossenen Verhandlungen über die Reform des EuGH-Statuts zwischen EU-Parlament und EU-Rat</a>, an denen der Abgeordnete der Piratenpartei Dr. Patrick Breyer beteiligt war. Die neue Transparenzregel gilt für alle von nationalen Gerichten dem EuGH vorgelegten Fragen („Vorabentscheidungsverfahren“). Auf Initiative Breyers, der von Beruf selbst Richter ist, hatte das Europaparlament einen öffentlichen Zugang zu den in Gerichtsverfahren ausgetauschten Schreiben und Argumenten gefordert.</p>



<p>„Mit der systematischen Veröffentlichung gewechselter Schreiben und Argumente wird der Europäische Gerichtshof so transparent wie noch nie. Das setzt Maßstäbe auch für die deutsche Justiz. Es ist ein Privileg, dass ich als Abgeordneter der Piratenpartei unser Kernanliegen eines transparenten Staates in die Verhandlungen einbringen und dank der Unterstützung meiner Kolleginnen und Kollegen erfolgreich durchsetzen konnte. Auch der <a href="https://www.article19.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Open-statement-EU-Court-of-Justice-Reform-should-mandate-access-to-documents-FINAL-2.pdf">Druck aus der Zivilgesellschaft hat dazu beigetragen.</a></p>



<p>Nach Grundsatzurteilen mit weitreichenden Folgen hat die Öffentlichkeit ein Recht darauf, die Forderungen unserer Regierungen und Institutionen zu kennen und zu diskutieren. Ich bin sicher, wir werden von den Positionen der Bundesregierung teils überrascht sein. In einer Demokratie, in der Pressefreiheit herrscht, müssen die Mächtigen auch für ihr Verhalten vor Gericht zur Rechenschaft gezogen werden können. In Zeiten, in denen die EU und ihr Gerichtshof in einer Vertrauenskrise stecken, schafft Transparenz Vertrauen.</p>



<p>Natürlich genügt die neue Transparenzregel mit ihren Beschränkungen und Vorbehalten noch nicht vollständig unseren Erwartungen. Besonders ob Transparenzverweigerer ihr Widerspruchsrecht gegen eine Veröffentlichung systematisch missbrauchen werden, werden wir genau beobachten. Dennoch ist die Einführung des Grundsatzes der proaktiven Transparenz in der EU-Justiz ein Meilenstein und Paradigmenwechsel.“</p>

  <p>I participated in a meeting titled “Meta’s Threads Interoperating in the Fediverse Data Dialogue”
at Meta in San Francisco yesterday. It brought together a good number of Meta/Threads
people (across engineering, product, policy), some Fediverse entrepreneurs like myself,
some people who have been involved in ActivityPub standardization, a good number of
industry observers / commentators, at least one journalist, and people from independent
organizations whose objective is to improve the state of the net. Altogether about 30 people.</p>
<p>It was conducted under the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_rule">Chatham House rule</a>, so I am only
posting my impressions, and I don’t identify people and what specific people said.
(Although most attendees volunteered for a public group photo at the end; I will post a
link when I get one. Photo added at the bottom of this post.)</p>
<p>For the purposes of this post, I’m not going to comment about larger questions such as
whether Meta is good or bad, should be FediBlock’ed immediately or not; I’m simply
writing down some notes about this meeting.</p>
<p>In no particular order:</p>
 
 
<p>The Threads team has been doing a number of meetings like this, in various geographies
(London was mentioned), and with various stakeholders including the types of people that
came to this meeting, as well as Fediverse instance operators, regulators and civil society.</p>
 
 
<p>Apparently many (most?) invitees to these meetings were invited because other
invitees had been recommending them. I don’t know whether or what kind of future meetings
like this they are planning, but I’d be happy to pass along names if we know each other
and you get in touch. Thanks to – you know who you are – who passed along my name.</p>
 
 
<p>The Threads team comes across as quite competent and thoughtful at what they do.</p>
 
 
<p>On some subjects that are “obvious” to those of use who have hung around open federated
systems long enough like myself, many attendees seemed strangely underinformed. I didn’t get the
impression that they don’t want to know, but simply that integrating with the
“there-is-nobody-in-charge” Fediverse is so different from other types of projects they
have done in the past, they are still finding their bearings. I heard several:
“A year ago, I did not know what the Fediverse was.”</p>
 
 
<p>Rolling out a large node – like Threads will be – in a complex, distributed system that’s
as decentralized and
heterogeneous as the Fediverse is not something anybody really has done before. It’s
unclear what can go wrong, so the right approach appears to be to go step-by-step,
feature by feature: try it, see how it works in practice, fix what needs fixing,
and only then move on to the next feature.</p>
 
 
<p>That gradual approach opens them up to suspicions their implementation is one-sided
and entirely self-serving. I guess that can’t be avoided until everything is deployed
they publicly said they will deploy.</p>
 
 
<p>While there are many challenges, I did get the impression the project is proceeding
more or less as planned, and there are no major obstacles.</p>
 
 
<p>Everybody knows and is aware Meta brings a “trust deficit” to the Fediverse. The best
mitigation mentioned was to be as transparent as possible about all aspects of what
they plan and do.</p>
<p>I think that’s a good approach, but also that they can do far more on transparency than
they have so far. For example, they could publicly share a roadmap and the engineering
rationale for why the steps they identified need to be in this sequence.</p>
 
 
<p>There are many, many questions on many aspects of the Fediverse, from technical
details, to operational best practices, to regulatory constraints and how they apply
to a federated system. The group generally did not know, by and large, how to get them
answered, but agreed that meetings like this serve as a means to connect with people
who might know.</p>
<p>I think this is a problem all across the Fediverse, not specific to Meta. We – the
Fediverse – need to figure out a way to make that easier for new developers;
certainly my own learning curve to catch up was steeper than I would have liked, too.</p>
 
 
<p>Many people did not know about <a href="https://fediforum.org/">FediForum</a>, our Fediverse
unconference, and I suspect a bunch of the meeting attendees will come to the
next one (likely in March; we are currently working on picking a date). Many of
the discussions at this meeting would have been right at home as FediForum sessions,
and while I am clearly biased as FediForum organizer, I would argue that doing
meetings like this in an open forum like FediForum could help substantially with
the trust deficit mentioned above.</p>
 
 
<p>There’s significant interest in the Fediverse Test Suite we just
<a href="https://nlnet.nl/project/FediverseTestsuite/">got funding approval</a>
for from the EU’s NGI Zero program. There’s general agreement that the Fediverse
could work “better”, be more reliable, and more be comprehensible to mainstream users,
if we had better the test coverage than the Fediverse has today. This is of interest
to all new (and existing) developers.</p>
 
 
<p>There was a very interesting side discussion on whether it would be helpful for Fediverse
instances (including Threads) to share reputation information with other instances that
each instance might maintain on individual ActivityPub actors for its own purposes already.
Block lists as they are shared today are
a (very primitive) version of this; a more multi-faceted version might be quite
helpful across the Fediverse. This came up in a breakout group discussion, and
was part of brainstorming; I didn’t hear that anybody actually worked on this.</p>
 
 
<p>When we think of privacy risks when Meta connects to the Fediverse, we usually think of
what happens to data that moves from today’s Fediverse into Meta. I didn’t realize the
opposite is also quite a challenge (personal data posted to Threads, making its
way into the Fediverse) for an organization as heavily monitored by regulators around
the world as is Meta.</p>
 
 
<p>There was very little talk (not none, but little) about the impact on regulation, such as
the “continuous and real-time access” provision in the EU’s Digital Markets Act and
whether that was a / the driver for Fediverse integration.</p>
 
 
<p>There was very little discussion on business models for Threads, and where exactly
ads would go. For example, would ads just stay within the Threads app, or would they
inject them into ActivityPub feeds, like some companies did with RSS back in the days?
Of course, should that happen, as a non-Threads Fediverse user, one can always unfollow;
there is no way for them to plaster non-Threads users with ads if they
don’t interact with Threads accounts.</p>
 
 
<p>I came away convinced that the team working on Threads indeed genuinely wants to make
federation happen, and have it happen in a “good” way. I did not get any sense whatsoever
that any of the people I interacted were executing any secret agenda, whether
embrace-and-extend, favoring Threads in some fashion or anything like that. (Of course,
that is a limited data point, but I thought I convey it anyway.)</p>
 
 
<p>However, the meeting did not produce a clear answer to the elephant-in-the-room question that was
raised repeatedly by several attendees in several versions, which is some version of:
“All the openness with Threads, namely integration with the Fediverse, supporting account
migration out from Threads etc, is the opposite
of what Facebook/Meta has done over its history. What has fundamentally changed so
that you now believe openness is the better strategy?” And: “In the past Facebook was
a far more open system than it is today, you gradually locked it down. What guarantee
is there that your bosses won’t follow the same playbook this time, even if you
think they won’t?”</p>
<p>Personally I believe this question needs a better answer than has been given publicly
so far, and the answer needs to come from the very top of Meta. The statement must have
staying power beyond what any one executive can deliver.</p>
 
 
<p>I left the meeting with far more questions than I could get answered; but nobody wanted
to stay all night :-)</p>
<p>My gut feel is that it is safe to assume they will do a reasonably fair, responsible job with a gradual
rollout of federation for at least the next year or two or such. Beyond that, and in particular if
it turns out creators with large follower groups indeed move off Threads at a significant
rate (one of the stated reasons why they are implementing Fediverse support as
creators have asked for this), I don’t think we know at all what will happen. (I’m not
sure that anybody knows at this point.) And of course, none of this addresses the
larger issues that Meta has as an organization.</p>
<p>In the hope this summary was useful …</p>

<p>Der Industrieausschuss des EU-Parlaments hat heute gegen die Stimmen der Piraten und ihrer Fraktion einer neuen <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20231106IPR09006/eu-wide-digital-wallet-meps-reach-deal-with-council">EU-Verordnung zur digitalen Identität (eIDAS 2) zugestimmt:</a> Eine neue digitale-Identitäts-App soll es EU-Bürgern ermöglichen, auf öffentliche und private digitale Dienste wie Facebook oder Google zuzugreifen und online zu bezahlen. Dem <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meetdocs/2014_2019/plmrep/COMMITTEES/ITRE/DV/2023/12-07/10_eIDASprovisionalagreement_EN.pdf">Deal</a> wurde zugestimmt, obwohl IT-Sicherheitsexpert:innen und Wissenschaftler:innen öffentlich vor Massenüberwachung <a href="https://eidas-open-letter.org/statement-23-11-2023.pdf">warnen</a> und zuletzt auch Desinformation der EU entgegen getreten <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/response-to_eIDAS_briefing_note_1december2023.pdf">sind</a>.</p>



<p>“Diese Verordnung ist ein Blankoscheck zur Online-Überwachung der Bürger und gefährdet unsere Privatsphäre und Sicherheit im Internet”, kommentiert der Abgeordnete der Piratenpartei Dr. Patrick Breyer. “Die Browsersicherheit wird untergraben, und Überidentifizierung wird nach und nach unser Recht auf anonyme Nutzung digitaler Dienste aushöhlen. Mark Zuckerberg sollte kein Recht haben, unseren Ausweis zu sehen! Wenn wir unser digitales Leben anstelle von Facebook und Google der Regierung anvertrauen, kommen wir vom Regen in die Traufe. Dieser Deal opfert unverzichtbare Anforderungen im Verhandlungsmandat des Europäischen Parlaments, die die eID-App datenschutzfreundlich und sicher gemacht hätten. Die EU verpasst die Chance, einen vertrauenswürdigen Rahmen zur Modernisierung und Digitalisierung unserer Gesellschaft zu schaffen. Wir werden die Umsetzung jetzt sehr genau beobachten, diese wird entscheidend über Chancen und Risiken der digitalen Identität bestimmen.”</p>



<p>Anja Hirschel, Spitzenkandidation der Piratenpartei für die Europawahl 2024, ergänzt: „Die eID wird eine schnelle und bequeme eindeutige Identifikation im Netz ermöglichen. Darin liegt der Nutzen, aber gleichzeitig auch die Gefahr: Ohne geeignete Schutzmaßnahmen und Regelungen ist es auch für Anbieter von Diensten, die eigentlich keinerlei verifizierte, persönliche Zuordnung benötigen, eine große Versuchung diesen ‘praktischen Dienst’ anzubieten. So gelangen immer mehr persönliche Daten von uns in Hände, die diese nicht benötigen, und unser Onlineverhalten wird exakt nachvollziehbar, ob wir das nun wollen oder nicht.“</p>



<p>Die Piratenabgeordneten Mikulas Peksa und Dr. Patrick Breyer haben bis zur letzten Minute daran gearbeitet, zumindest einige der zahlreichen Risiken des EU-Systems zur digitalen Identität zu beseitigen. Ein großer Erfolg ist, dass die Mitgliedstaaten nicht verpflichtet sein werden, jedem Bürger eine lebenslängliche Personenkennziffer zuzuweisen. Die Nutzung der eID-App wird freiwillig sein, und es wird weiterhin möglich sein, mit anderen bestehenden Identifizierungs- und Authentifizierungsmitteln auf öffentliche und private Dienste zuzugreifen. Der App-Client wird quelloffen sein.</p>



<p>„Insgesamt bleibt das System jedoch ein Blankoscheck zur Überwachung der Bürger:innen im Netz“, so Breyer. „Wie Hunderte von Wissenschaftlern öffentlich warnen und entgegen den Behauptungen der EU könnten die Hersteller von Webbrowsern künftig gezwungen werden, unsere sicher verschlüsselte Internetnutzung (einschließlich intimer und sensibler Online-Aktivitäten) der staatlichen Überwachung preiszugeben. Dies ist ein inakzeptabler Angriff auf sichere Verschlüsselung. Die eID-App könnte auch dazu verwendet werden, unser digitales Leben zu überwachen, da Unbeobachtbarkeit ihrer Nutzung und Unverkettbarkeit nicht gefordert wird. Der Inhalt unserer eID-Wallets, in denen z.B. persönliche Bankdaten, ärztliche Verschreibungen und Strafregistereinträge gespeichert werden können, könnte in zentralen Datenbanken gespeichert und dort überwacht werden, da wir kein Recht haben, digitale Dokumente ausschließlich auf unseren persönlichen Geräten speichern zu lassen.</p>



<p>Die Verlockung sich mit einer einzigen offiziellen eID-App bequem bei allen privaten digitalen Diensten anmelden zu können ist eine Falle: Überidentifizierung wird nach und nach unser Recht auf anonyme Nutzung digitaler Dienste aushöhlen, das uns derzeit vor kriminellen Aktivitäten, unbefugter Offenlegung, Identitätsdiebstahl, Stalking und anderen Formen des Missbrauchs personenbezogener Daten schützt. Die eID-App wird die Nutzung mehrerer, wirksam getrennter Nutzerprofile nicht zulassen, auf die schutzbedürftige Personen aber angewiesen sind.</p>



<p>Der serverseitige Code der eID-App muss nicht quelloffen sein, was bedeutet, dass die Öffentlichkeit nicht wissen kann, was der Code tatsächlich tut und ob er sicher ist.</p>



<p>In Anbetracht all dessen wird die neue EU-eID-App nicht vertrauenswürdig sein und die Entwicklung digitaler Behördengänge in Europa nicht ausreichend fördern – sehr zum Bedauern der Piraten.“</p>

<p>Meta, das Unternehmen hinter <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/12/default-end-to-end-encryption-on-messenger/">Facebook, WhatsApp und Instagram, hat bedeutende Sicherheitsverbesserungen für den Messenger-Dienst zum Austausch von Direktnachrichten angekündigt.</a> Der Messenger erhält eine automatische Ende-zu-Ende-Verschlüsselung für sämtliche persönliche Anrufe und Nachrichten. Der digitale Freiheitskämpfer und langjährige Gegner flächendeckender Chatkontrollen Dr. Patrick Breyer, Europaabgeordneter der Piratenpartei und Schattenberichterstatter seiner Fraktion, kommentiert:</p>



<p>“Zuckerbergs überfälliger Schritt ist auch ein <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/zerstoerung-des-digitalen-briefgeheimnisses-klage-gegen-chatkontrolle-eingereicht/">Erfolg meiner Klage</a> gegen Metas freiwillige Chatkontrolle: Mit der heute angekündigten schrittweisen Einführung sicherer Ende-zu-Ende-Verschlüsselung von Direktnachrichten per Voreinstellung stoppen Facebook und Instagram ihre freiwillige Chatkontrolle und respektieren das Telekommunikationsgeheimnis der Nutzer.</p>



<p>Die freiwillige Massenüberwachung unserer privaten Kommunikation leistet keinen signifikanten Beitrag zur Rettung missbrauchter Kinder oder Überführung von Missbrauchtätern, sondern kriminalisiert umgekehrt tausende Minderjähriger, überlastet Strafverfolger und öffnet einer willkürlichen Privatjustiz der Internetkonzerne Tür und Tor. Die freiwillige Chatkontrolle konnte die Menge angeblichen Missbrauchsmaterial auf Zuckerbergs Plattformen nie eindämmen. Die Entlastung der Polizei von der Flut zum großen Teil falscher Verdachtsmeldungen macht Kapazitäten für die verstärkte Verfolgung und verdeckte Ermittlungen gegen organisierten Kindesmissbrauchs frei, was Kinder wirklich schützt und die Hintermänner stoppt. Auch ohne Chatkontrolle werden weiterhin Verdachtsmeldungen der Nutzer und Meldungen aus dem Scannen öffentlicher Posts auf Facebook und Instagram eingehen.</p>



<p>Leider setzt Zuckerberg durch verdachtslose Analyse unserer Kommunikationsdaten (Metadatenanalyse) weiterhin auf völlig unzuverlässige Verfahren zur Verdächtigung von Nutzern, die private Nachrichten senden. Zum Glück zwingen wir Piraten den Konzern per Digital Markets Act künftig, eine dienstübergreifende Kommunikation mit alternativen, sichereren und datenschutzfreundlicheren Messengern zuzulassen, so dass ein Wechsel zu sicheren Kommunikationsdiensten realistisch wird.</p>



<p>Gleichzeitig unterlässt Zuckerberg wirklich wirksame Schutzmaßnahmen durch sichere Gestaltung von Facebook und Instagram (Security by Design), die seinen Profiten schaden würden. Warum werden Jugendliche etwa nicht altersunabhängig gefragt, bevor ihre Fotos öffentlich sichtbar sind und sie für Fremde ansprechbar sind? Naheliegende Schutzmaßnahmen vor sexueller Annäherung an Kinder sind wirksamer als jede ungezielte Massenüberwachung!”</p>

<p>This open letter and touching memoir was written by my friend Washington Sean after listening to my recent ramblings about Trichotomy and anticipated territorial skirmishes over an imagined inter-dimensional bridge where piles of soul bound tokens might be held in the future, inert digital golems awaiting the spirits of inbound travelers. My birthday is later this week and this offering feels like a special gift. It was a delight to picture myself a bit in that magical place beyond the looming gate of St. Thomas Aquinas. And I didn’t have to carry 40 pounds of gear up a mountain! </p>
<p>I’ve been thinking a lot about multiverses and portals and one’s life work. After I finished the trichotomy stream, Washington Sean and I exchanged a few emails about consciousness and shipping companies – waves, you know. I brought up W.R. Grace and J. Peter Grace Jr. of the Grace Line, devout Catholics with ties to the Trappist Abbey in Spencer, MA outside Worcester. RFK Jr.’s dad Joseph was a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=curaT-RXUlA">fellow-Catholic colleague with the Maritime Commission.</a> I sense that standardized contemplative prayer is a key element in the B-Corp social impact “moral economy,” a game where focused spiritualized attention will be used to fuel the Web3 global brain platform. </p>
<p>Below is the stream, I’ll put a screenshot of that map with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpiZ3_P7B_I">link</a> in case you wish to explore where the Grace empire intersects with the Vatican and Zen Buddhist brownie bakeries staffed by former-felons. My friend is a talented photographer. Enjoy his windows into a time before the fire.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dear Alison,</p>
<p>Ok — so I am having a hard time with this last email you sent me. &nbsp;In the email you addressed the concept of a trichotomy as a means of explaining the differences between the mind/spirit, the body and the soul. And you also mentioned Thomas Aquinas and pointed to J Peter Grace and his role as a past Governor (Board of Directors) for a school called Thomas Aquinas College.</p>
<p>Peter Grace, “whose wife was a key player in Vatican II” was also mentioned in your email. This wasn’t unexpected as we had been discussing shipping magnates Stavros Niarchos and Aristotle Onassis and their connection to the Negroponte brothers (another typical conversation with Alison, right?) and somehow Peter Grace was mixed in, someone I’d never heard of before. And so, with all of these topics thrown into an email is nothing too out of the ordinary, as our correspondences are often filled with different threads and rabbit holes. But unknowingly on your part, you had sent something else that was embedded in your email — something else that caused a peculiar epiphany – a sort of unsettling realization about our research endeavors that led to an interesting reevaluation of my own past – my own lived experience.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Specifically, it was your mention of how Thomas Aquinas College was fitting into this mix. I know I’ve mentioned I grew up in Ventura County, but I’ve never told you about the significance of the College in my own life. Nor would I have ever had a reason to until now… So, this is another ‘bizarre’ coincidence — or perhaps more evidence of our ability to tap into the magical realism of our lived experiences – perhaps sharing a mutual ‘frequency’ or a least being signaled to look at certain topics, certain ideas, within a common bandwidth, listening for concepts and symbols that resonate with me, with us, right now.</p>
<p>Thomas Aquinas College now has two locations – and they did not open the Massachusetts location until 2019. But — and here is why this is weird and personal — the California campus is in Ventura County where I grew up. But not just that — the campus sits at the entrance of a popular trail head where I literally ‘grew up’ — as in — where I slowly turned into a man; and where I formed a relationship with God and nature; where I battled my place in the world and contemplated my existence in the future.</p>
<p>The CA campus is located in Santa Paula canyon along state Highway 150 between the communities of Santa Paula and Ojai. It was near the campus that the ‘Thomas Fire’ of 2017 started. The Thomas Fire was, for a brief period, California’s largest wildfire in total burned acreage, scorching over 280,000 acres, but it’s place at the top of the charts was quickly usurped by another raging firestorm in the following season. Several of my close friends lost their homes in that fire including my two best friends. A great effort was made by the local fire department to protect the college a few days after the east winds event was over and when the winds changed, and the fire began to burn back the way it had come. The college experienced only minor physical damage, but the traumatic impact of the fire still lives on in that part of Ventura County.</p>
<p>Ironically, even though I have called the Pacific Northwest home for many years, I was visiting a friend for his birthday in 2017 (on November 30th — surely just another coincidence that November 30th is the same day you sent this perplexing email) who was battling cancer for the 3rd bout.&nbsp; A couple days later his sister’s home in the Ventura foothills, where the birthday party was hosted, was completely obliterated.&nbsp; I looked online at the drone shots that were available and I could pick their house out – a pile of ashes with only a gun safe standing in what used to be the garage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was in town for only two nights, so the day after the birthday party in Ventura I visited my best friend’s home in upper Santa Paula whose house was very close to the origin of the fire that would erupt two days later, and it was among the first to burn down. Of the few things they had time to grab before they left, was the wedding plaque that we had commissioned to be carved in leather commemorating the year of their union (2012). My friend’s wife tells a great story of how she ran back into the house and had to use a stick to knock it off the wall since she could not reach it.</p>
<p>Their home was not far as the crow flies from the campus grounds, and it is odd in fact, that I can still remember driving down Highway 150 after my visit with them as I was on my way back home to my parents’ house where I’d soon bum a ride from my father and get dropped at the Burbank airport and catch the last flight back to Portland. But on that drive home that night I passed by the campus, and I can recall how raw and powerful the winds were already blowing. Call it a premonition, or a hunch, but the thought of fire entered my mind that night, right as I drove by the Thomas Aquinas College campus. Two days later, the winds would grow even more ferocious and would knock down an electrical wire, sparking the fire. By that Tuesday I had learned what had happened. And it was on a Wednesday morning that I would be delivering opening remarks for the small non-profit I was president of at the time. It was our annual awards breakfast and while I kept a cheery face for our sponsors and guests, inside I was solemn and grieving, and I couldn’t help but feel a tad guilty for having a premonition, not having the knowledge or intuitive sense of how to act on it, and then learning how many of my friends were now burned out of their homes, their lives forever altered.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Thomas Aquinas College campus sits above the Santa Paula creek on a small bluff nestled between hilly terrain at the mouth of Santa Paula canyon. This is not a ‘mighty river’ or a mountain river that one might see or think of as imagined in one of the more pristine national parks of the Sierra Nevada. The Santa Paula creek is a typical river of the Los Padres National Forest. Much of the time, rivers in southern California run at a low flow rate and often they can barely muster a trickle or even dry up completely, running ephemerally for long stretches before entering the myriad of pathways into the greater water table. However, during periods of heavy rain, these same little creeks can turn into flood channels of immense power and geological change – deluges capable of swallowing huge swaths of land and altering the landscape in a matter of days or hours. The clay soils have poor drainage and cannot absorb the water fast enough. And after intense fires, the sage, manzanita, and scrub brush of the chapparal can leave a layer of plant derived oil that coats the surface with a thin, impermeable layer, further exacerbating the drainage issues. Thus, the Los Padres National Forest, and the terrain around the Santa Paula canyon are areas that have been experiencing rapid geological transformation – occurring in faster cycles than more stout or solid mountain ranges.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There is a sulphur spring near the mouth of the Santa Paula canyon. The smell is thick, and the pronounced stench of rotten eggs is hard to miss on the highway, as it just before the main trailhead parking areas. Up until very recently, by grant of an old easement with the Thomas Aquinas College, the National Forest Service, and the other ranch and property owners, the first mile of the trail actually cut through the campus property, ascending a few hundred feet in elevation along an asphalt road. The road crests by the Ferndale Ranch (home to a meandering flock of peacocks for many years) then drops down and heads around a bend. The last point on private property was just past the oil wells where the road ended, and a dirt trail formally began. It was only a few years ago that the campus was finally successful in obtaining new easement rights along the creek directly to the parking lots so that the official trail no longer goes through the campus property at all. But from the time I was a child and even through my 20’s and late 30’s the trail always involved that long, winding road.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My first trip into Santa Paula canyon was in 4th grade – as part of a day long field trip through my public elementary school. In fact, now that I think of it, lots of the public school kids in took day trips to the Ferndale Ranch (located just beyond the College campus) and hiked in to Punch Bowls — about 2 1/2 miles of hiking with a fairly steep and laborious slug up a hill at the end to climb for nine and ten year olds. The cliffs near the punch bowls were really dangerous — and the water could easily kill drown a child or adult during the non-drought years – as a series of cascading pools with increasingly large cliff jumps was more the stuff of adventurers and high school kids, not elementary or middle schoolers. I did not do the jumps until in my early twenties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The year after I did the ‘outdoor education’ through my public elementary school, it would have been 1992 or 1993, the district discontinued the program as a tragic drowning occurred with another school — a 12-year-old boy passed away when he got sucked over the falls. But even though the schools stopped taking kids there, the popularity of the spot has only grown and my mother kept taking us there through our adolescence. In fact, she used to call it ‘church’ and on more than one occasion she called in sick for us and took us hiking so that we could “go to church.” Raised catholic, but never practicing, my mom considered it more important to be in nature than in a giant building when it came to praising God and his creation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But it was later in my life that the East Fork trail and Santa Paula Canyon became even more important. One of my best friends, the one who would later lose his home near the origin of the Thomas Fire, was the one who introduced me and another friend to the camp. He had been there as a boy with his father, and he had sort of rediscovered it. Through the Thomas Aquinas college campus, up the Santa Paula Canyon trail and then past the popular ‘Punch Bowls’ (we always called them the moon rocks) hiking spot, was the old and in some spots, quite non-existent trail that went up the East Fork that led to the secret camp. Truth be told, it wasn’t really ‘secret’, and it was more like ‘rediscovered’. The camp, that we endearingly called ‘the land of one hundred waters’, was shown on some older maps, not on newer ones. But Santa Paula Peak, situated prominently above the valley where the camp was located, was listed on the Sierra Clubs’ Top 50 Peaks in California. And other prominent hikers knew of the camp and old trails. So, while it was sort of hard to get to and somewhat forgotten, the idea of it being a true secret was more romanticized than reality. The camp actually use to have a wagon trail to it (supposedly) in the late 19th century, where pioneer families would take extended vacations, but our ascent was always along the worn and mostly faded away and long neglected trail.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After the 2004-2005 floods, most of even the old trail washed away and it became more like boulder scrambling until the very last bit. Despite the technical difficulty and the lack of stable ground, the destination made it worth it. The camp was ‘a secret camp’ partly because it had some improvements that were added by a generation of hikers and campers that came before us. My friend’s father was a member of these hikers, part of a group of friends comprising an informal fraternity of sorts. The camp they built for themselves in the late 70’s and early 80’s included improvements that most camps do not have – especially those that are a full day’s hard walk through arduous terrain. The camp featured a twenty-foot long picnic table built out of a large fir tree that had been cut down and milled on site. There was also an asadero style bbq grill and an assortment of cast iron pots, skillets and other cookware. Nearby springs flowed year-round amidst a flat parcel of ground submerged beneath the deep shade of canyon live oaks that were hundreds of years old. Chumash griding bowls and mortars have been found in the area while exploring off the trails. About another thousand feet in elevation, above the camp, and along another worn and overgrown trail, there was located another camp sitting in huge boulders and cliffs comprised of sandstone and siltstone. The cliffs had this reddish tinge or hue to them that when hit with the last rays of sunlight, they’d turn the most amazing color before our eyes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we first started our hikes, the trail began by going through the large green cast iron gates at the entrance to the campus by the highway. On the weekends, the gates were locked and hikers were instructed by a sign to use the non-vehicle entrance. Strict instructions marked on signs all along the part of the road through the campus were hard to miss and the security guard was largely dedicated to making sure the hikers never wandered off the route. It almost felt intentional – the way the trailhead made the route so much longer. Surely, as we had tried on more than one occasion, there was a quicker, more efficient way through the campus.&nbsp; But on the weekends, hundreds, sometimes even over a thousand people on a real hot spell, would use the trailhead in search of the reliable swimming holes further up the canyon.</p>
<p></p>
<p>All in all, I have spent over a year of my life sleeping in this place. Starting at nineteen and through a lot of my twenties, I needed to be there, up the East Fork, at the secret camp, at the headwaters, near the eternal springs, nestled amidst the oaks and old growth firs, above the dominion of the Thomas Aquinas Campus. I wasn’t the only one. I shared this experience with my best friends. Even my wife has spent a few weeks camping up in this place and would know the college if mentioned. I could tell stories for hours of this place.</p>
<p>Five nights here, three or four days there – the days turned into weeks and the weeks piled into months. I soon realized that I was spending much of my free time going to this place. When I wasn’t working or on another adventure, I made my best effort to get my bag packed and get up the mountain. When I was faced with either getting a new roommate or moving into my van to save money, I chose my van. I was already spending so much time at camp – it was an easy choice and it helped me save money even quicker for the big trip to New Zealand I had been planning.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Quickly however, it became apparent that Thomas Aquinas College with its big cast iron gates and zealous security guards was a barrier to our adventures up the mountain. Eventually, even parking on the highway at the trailhead would become too risky as more than one of us had our windows smashed. So, finding a cut-through, or a quicker path to the get to camp was a matter of circumstance, not choice. The impedance of the college and its long and winding road became cumbersome and annoying. For most people, the hike ended at around the 3 ½ mile mark – when they got to moon rocks. But for us, that was only about a quarter of the way, and the biggest nuisance was always going through the gates and walking up the long and winding road around the campus water reclamation pond (fancy for on-site sewage treatment). It took at least thirty or forty-five minutes to walk that first section – getting past the oil wells and onto the rock and dirt track always offered a sigh of relief. A mile is not that far, but it is a noticeable distance that was hard to ignore with 40-50lbs of rations and gear stuffed in a backpack. Clearly, we were hindered and greatly bothered with what seemed extra or unnecessary labor put in front of us by the College.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So, we got bikes. We would use our bikes and ride up the hill along the asphalt path in extra low gear. Still physically difficult, but much quicker. And even better – on the way back we would really shave off the drag and droll of finishing a weekend of backpacking by plopping relentlessly along a hot, stinky asphalt path back to civilization. What better way than to whizz through the campus and down the hill in a mere instant – or about 25 mph. The security guard actually scolded us one time when we were riding our bikes too fast as even the cars were expected to observe a 15 mph speed limit.</p>
<p>Truth be told – there was actually another way to get to our secret camp – from an entirely different direction. So, in a sense, we could escape the dominion and the gates of Thomas Aquinas if we absolutely wanted to. We had found a way to our paradise that circumnavigated the more obvious and conventional path. But the other route featured its own drawbacks. First, it required an access code through a locked gate – so only certain people knew how to acquire the code (another easement battle from a forlorn era). But with the code, we could travel up the mouth of Timber canyon and ascend up the face of Santa Paula Peak. Like the Santa Paula Canyon trail, part of this felt redundant as there was, feasibly, a dirt road that would allow us to start closer to the actual forest (reserved public lands) lands. But we did not have permission to drive on the dirt roads. And this trail, being on an exposed and very sunny south face of a prominent 5,000 foot peak (the peak used to house a fire lookout tower and it was confirmed that a double-wide trail suitable for dirt bike travel used to exist all the way to the summit), was hard to climb during the day, and even in the winter months depending on the weather. We’d typically hike up the peak trail when cooler weather was around. On more than a few occasions we hiked up the peak at night. While better maintained and easier to navigate (up until 2021 washouts on the backside) this trail required more climbing and had a long descent into camp.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Weigh points along the peak trail last comprised of the following spots: ‘the house’ (burned in Thomas Fire but was the old trailhead start), the gate, the oaks (now known as ‘cow shit camp’, Kenny’s hill, the switchbacks, lunch rock, orange peel, soda pop, the peak spur, the saddle, the grassy spot, the last turn.</p>
<p>Weigh points along the canyon trail and the East Fork were last comprised of the following spots: The Gates (start of trail at highway), Ferndale, Noel’s place, the Oil well, the washout (aka ‘hell hill’), big cone, moon rocks, first crossing, log jam, poison oak camp, land of the milky white rocks, the witches portal, the flats, the spring trail, the meadow.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As I already mentioned, most hikers going up the canyon stopped just past big cone or the moon rocks (popularly known as the Punch Bowls), but our journey was always much longer. During the summer months we’d stash extra beers in the creek near the moon rocks for the last stop on our return hike home. Before retrieving our bikes (also stashed nearby) we would drink, swim and eat whatever last rations we had managed to save. Our adventures ended with riding the rest of the trail in a slightly altered state of consciousness, gleefully blowing past the other hikers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Eventually we learned the cycle of the big weekend hikers and campers could occasionally yield substantial gleanings of food, clothes and an assortment of abandoned camping gear. Descending the trail after a big summer weekend filled with tourists came with the feeling of returning to civilization in phases – the moon rocks and surrounding camping areas functioned as a sort of open-air dumpster or secondhand store. Any valuable gear we found we would stash for our next hike up. But discarded food stuffs such as ultra-processed and flavor enhanced cheese chips or a bag (opened or not it wouldn’t matter) of fortified and enriched chocolate chip cookies was always a welcome addition to our favorite end of hike snack – the ‘tuna boat’ – a green bell pepper stuffed with chunk tuna and chopped onions, cilantro and jalapeno or serrano, and finished with a few dallops of hot sauce from a fast food condiment packet.</p>
<p>Groups of people would come to the moon rocks from the nearby towns of Ventura, Oxnard, Camarillo and Port Hueneme for day hikes. Sometimes even people from Los Angeles County would hike in the canyon near the popular swimming spots. In my lifetime, the canyon acquired great popularity and many young people found it a particularly cool place to ‘camp out and party’. The drinking and revelry often combined with a lack of experience in many of the camping basics –concepts that we took for granted like what to bring and how to stay nourished and hydrated were not taught in the limited curriculum of field trips and ‘outdoor education’ available in elementary school. This resulted in a great number of hang overs and many of the inexperienced campers simply abandoning leftover food, dirty clothes, and even perfectly good gear that just looked too heavy to carry to a nineteen-year-old with a throbbing headache. Their discarded leftovers were always our miraculous discoveries.</p>
<p>So much of my life, my energy field, the imprint of who I am (and who I am still to become) is in relation to that magical place. I have hundreds (probably thousands) of photos of my time in the East Fork canyon and Los Padres National Forest. I hope you can appreciate the significance of the coincidence and the elements of magical realism that present here.</p>
<p>Thomas Aquinas College was always a gatekeeper – not just a ‘way’ point, on our trail, but also, a ‘weigh’ point, a spot on the trail that weighed both our packs and our worthiness as we traveled through its dominion. After passing through the gates, it taxed us appropriately on our travels into higher realms.</p>
<p>The important work that I would do up in the camps and bluffs above the dominion of the college, beyond the realm of the material world, was spiritual work. True, our materialist trappings of fine cuts of meat, malted ales and other liquors, legumes, potatoes and assorted vegetables, they always traveled with us, as they served to literally weigh us down all along the chosen route. But the majority of the work done at camp was always spiritual work. In fact, one of my best friends, (not the one who lived right next to the fire, but who also lost his home(s) to the fire), worked for several years to construct his very own cabin, hidden away from camp up in the bluffs, nestled in its own little nook. It was a beautiful little forest cabin before it burned down in the Thomas Fire. It was comprised of a variety of native stone and hand-hewn lumber, and also some building materials he had carried in. It had taken him months of accumulated time to build it, almost all by his own hand. Before it burned down, he used to refer to it as ‘his life’s work.’</p>
<p></p>
<p>What is this notion of our ‘life’s work’? The time that I craved to be there – and the amount of time I spent there – for some it was perceived as escaping from work or escaping from responsibility – from existence in the material realm. But it never felt like that for me.&nbsp; It was a place of great importance, and learning. Of experiments and mysteries.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I didn’t understand it in this way then – but the important barrier (or bridge) that Thomas Aquinas College served in my travels isn’t just an inconvenience. It was a physical burden to have to pass through the gates of Thomas Aquinas College and walk the extra mile. But now, now I see that it was also a spiritual bridge that they controlled – or, more precisely, closely monitored.</p>
<p>At first, I used to believe that the college was not receptive of the hikers, and that they’d rather not have us there. The stern nature of the signs and security guards keeping everyone on the right path seemed bothersome to the pristine and peaceful environment that was cultivated on the campus grounds. But now, re-thinking the role not as an inconvenience to the college, but instead, as a chosen duty, or a higher calling, a sort of self-endowed guardianship over a gateway and control of the bridge, or the portal, from one dimension to the next. The college watched over my travels as I left material world and prepared to ascend into the spiritual world. They were monitoring my travel into and out of Gods splendor – now I see that it was not an accident that the college situated itself in this manner. The perceived hacks and different techniques my friends and I learned to get around the expectation and presumed relationship with the College as gate keeper and pathway enforcer were beneficial to us, but that did not diminish the college’s dominion over the bridge or the majority of other hikers. In fact, it was only because of our desire to return to the higher realms over and over again that the important role the college served became noticeable. Had I only hiked into the canyon on occasion, it would be easy to overlook. But having made this special place my literal second home, the college was always the first weigh point on the longer journey.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thomas Aquinas College is not far from several other notable institutions of learning and foundations of spiritual significance. The Ojai Valley has been a center of new thought for well over a century now (and quite longer if considering indigenous cosmology). Just over four miles from the college campus as the crow flies, there is the Ojai Valley School, an alternative education school for children founded in 1911. And not far off, perhaps another mile or so further west is the Thacher School, established even earlier in 1887. Situated close to the Thacher school is the Krishnamurti Foundation for America, another well-known institution. It was in 1922, in Ojai, where Jiddu Krishnamurti is said to have had a “life changing experience.” Directly to the west of Thomas Aquinas College, about five miles away and sitting atop the summit of Sulphur Mountain is Meher Mount – a spiritual retreat center first established in 1946 and dedicated to the Avatar Baba Meher. A little further west and centrally located in the small town of Ojai is the Krotona Theosopical Society – first founded in Hollywood in 1912, and later relocated in Ojai in 1922. Yogi Paramahansa Yogananda was known to visit the area and helped found his spiritual sanctuary in 1950 as part of his self-realization fellowship. No doubt there are more places of spiritual and cultural significance in and around Thomas Aquinas College. The reputation of the area precedes itself.</p>
<p>However, in taking a step back and thinking about the college’s place differently, and in general contemplating what it is about this area that has drawn so many to the area in search of enlightenment, I could not help but wonder – where the energy is coming from? Is it inherent in the land, as if by a magical grid or ley lines? Or is this energy coming in from somewhere else?</p>
<p>Just south of the campus and the sulphur springs, about two miles away, is another site of importance that has reemerged as important – perhaps the most significant and important site of all – that suggests broadening my horizons even further – and asking, or perhaps, doing the work to begin to formulate new questions, better questions, that stretch my understanding of the intelligent forces at work in our world.</p>
<p>COMSAT, a global satellite communications company, established its teleport site in Santa Paula in 1975. The site is shown on the COMSAT webpage under its ‘commercial’ heading. But, as of November 1, 2023, COMSAT, and SatCom Direct, are now part of Goonhilly. The technical components at the site and the capabilities of the site far exceed mere commercial endeavors.</p>
<p>For many years I just assumed that the satellite dishes and arrays that are visible from the highway, just south of the gates at Thomas Aquinas, were nothing special – just more telecommunications equipment for the burgeoning cellular telephone industry. Now I understand that the array there is unique – and possesses capabilities to look farther into space – into a cosmic void where one day we might discover the true meaning of intelligence.</p>
<p>Goonhilly “is one of the world’s premier space communication gateways providing control and uplinks for satellites and deep space missions.” With the recent acquisition of COMSAT Teleports, including the Santa Paula site, Goonhilly is expanding “all communication service offerings from LEO (Low Earth Orbit) right through commercial GEO to lunar and deep space.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Goonhilly’s first site was located at Goonhilly Downs, near Helston on the Lizard Pennisula in Cornwall, England. Under a 999-year lease from British Telecom (BT Inc.) it was one of the largest stations in the world at its inception and still possesses some of the most advanced capabilities on the planet. Its parabolic dish, nicknamed ‘Arthur,’ was one of the first of its kind. Its current largest dish, called ‘Merlin’ is equally impressive in the modern era.</p>
<p>Now, connected to the Santa Paula site next to the Thomas Aquinas College (and others around the earth), Goonhilly has positioned itself in many ways as its own kind of keeper, or guardian, of our ability to move from one dimension to the next. Goonhilly maintains the flow of information as it is transformed from the physical experience into digitized atoms and bits that are parceled and scattered into the heavens. As the information slowly coalesces and comes back together again, it is Goonhilly that is now positioned to monitor and carefully watch over our access to intelligence and information as we pursue our rightful place in existence and amongst the higher realms.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Space signaling, and earth-based radar as a form of communication and wayfinding from one dimension to the next, is a technologically complex subject that I don’t ever think I will fully understand. Nor should I have to. As long as I am alive, I will keep my eyes (and my heart) open to discovering new ways around the barriers or tolled bridges or locked gates that slow me down and impede my journey. As long as I am alive, I will look for ways to lighten my pack and quicken my journey as I pass by the weigh points.</p>

<p>It was 11am at the Fort Lauderdale airport, an hour after my non-stop flight to Portland was supposed to have boarded. As I had been watching our estimated departure get pushed back in 15 minute increments, I finally received the dreaded news over the loudspeaker - the flight was cancelled entirely. As hordes of people started lining up to rebook their flights with the gate agent, I found a quiet spot in the corner and opened up my laptop to look at my options.</p>

<p>The other Alaska Airlines flight options were pretty terrible. There was a Fort Lauderdale to Seattle to Portland option that would have me landing at midnight. A flight on a partner airline had a 1-hour connection through Dallas, and there were only middle seats available on both legs. So I started to get creative, and searched for flights from Orlando, about 200 miles north. There was a non-stop on Alaska Airlines at 7pm, with plenty of available seats, so I called up customer service and asked them to change my booking. Since the delay was their fault, there were no change fees even though the flight was leaving from a different airport.</p>

<p>So now it was my responsibility to get myself from Miami to Orlando by 7pm. I could have booked a flight on a budget airline for $150, but it wouldn't have been a very nice experience, and I'd have a lot of time to kill in the Orlando airport. Then I remembered the Brightline train recently opened new service from Miami to Orlando, supposedly taking less time than driving there.</p>

 Brightline Station Fort Lauderdale 

<p></p>

<p>Never having tried to take that train before, I didn't realize they run a shuttle service from the Fort Lauderdale airport to the train station, so I jumped in an Uber headed to the station. On the way there, I booked a ticket on my phone. The price from Miami to Orlando was $144 for Coach, or $229 for Premium class. Since this will probably be the only time I take this train for the foreseeable future, I splurged for the Premium class ticket to see what that experience is like.</p>

<p>Astute readers will have noticed that I mentioned I booked a ticket from Miami rather than Fort Lauderdale. We'll come back to that in a bit. Once I arrived at the station, I began my Brightline experience.</p>

<p>Walking in to the station felt like something between an airport and a car rental center.</p>

<p></p>

<p>There was a small ticket counter in the lobby, but I already had a ticket on my phone so I went up the escalators.</p>

<p></p>

<p>At the top of the escalators was an electronic gate where you scan your QR code to go through. Mine didn't work (again, more on that later), but it was relatively empty and a staff member was able to look at my ticket on my phone and let me through anyway. There was a small X-Ray machine, I tossed my roller bag and backpack onto the belt, but kept my phone and wallet in my pocket, and walked through the security checkpoint.</p>

<p>Once through the minimal security checkpoint, I was up in the waiting area above the platform with a variety of different sections. There was a small bar with drinks and snacks, a couple large seating areas, an automated mini mart, some tall tables...</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>... and the entrance to the Premium lounge.</p>

 Brightline Station Premium Lounge 

<p></p>

<p>The Premium Lounge entrance had another electronic gate with a QR code scanner. I tried getting in but it also rejected my boarding pass. My first thought was I booked my ticket just 10 minutes earlier so it hadn't synced up yet, so I went back to the the security checkpoint and asked what was wrong. They looked at my boarding pass and had no idea what was wrong, and let me in to the lounge via the back employee-only entrance instead.</p>

<p>Once inside the lounge, I did a quick loop to see what kind of food and drink options there were. The lounge was entirely un-attended, the only staff I saw were at the security checkpoint, and someone occasionally coming through to take out dirty dishes.</p>

<p>The first thing you're presented with after entering the lounge is the beverage station. There are 6 taps with beer and wine, and you use a touch screen to make your selection and pour what you want.</p>

<p></p>

<p>On the other side of the wall is the food. I arrived at the tail end of the breakfast service, so there were pretty slim pickings by the end.</p>

<p></p>

<p>There were yogurts, granola, a bowl of bacon and egg mix, several kinds of pastries, and a bowl of fruit that nobody seemed to have touched. I don't know if this was just because this was the end of the morning, but if you were vegan or gluten free there was really nothing you could eat there.</p>

<p>There was also a coffee and tea station with some minimal options.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Shortly after I arrived, it rolled over to lunch time, so the staff came out to swap out the food at the food station. The lunch options were also minimal, but there was a bit more selection.</p>

<p></p>

<p>There was a good size meat and cheese spread. I'm not a big fan of when they mix the meat and cheese on the same plate, but there was enough of a cheese island in the middle I was reasonably confident I wasn't eating meat juice off the side of the cheeses. The pasta dish also had meat so I didn't investigate further. Two of the three wraps had meat and I wasn't confident about which were which so I skipped those. There was a pretty good spinach and feta salad, and some hummus as well as artichoke dip, and a variety of crackers. If you like desserts, there was an even better selection of small desserts as well.</p>

<p>At this point I was starting to listen for my train's boarding announcement. There was really barely any staff visible anywhere, but the few people I saw had made it clear they would clearly announce the train over the loudspeakers when it was time. There was also a sign at the escalators to the platform that said boarding opens 10 minutes before the train departs.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The trains run northbound and southbound every 1-2 hours, so it's likely that you'll only hear one announcement for a train other than yours the entire time you're there.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The one train announcement I heard was a good demonstration of how quickly the whole process actually is once the train shows up. The train pulls up, they call everyone down to the platform, and you have ten minutes to get onto the train. Ten minutes isn't much, but you're sitting literally right on top of the train platform so it takes no time to get down there.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Once your train is called, it's time to head down the escalator to the train platform!</p>

 Boarding the Train 

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>But wait, I mentioned my barcode had failed to be scanned a couple times at this point. Let me explain. Apparently, in my haste in the back of the Uber, I had actually booked a ticket from Miami to Orlando, but since I was already at the Fort Lauderdale airport, I had gone to the Fort Lauderdale Brightline station since it was the closest. So the departure time I saw on my ticket didn't match the time the train arrived at Fort Lauderdale, and the ticket gates refused to let me in because the ticket didn't depart from that station. I don't know why none of the employees who looked at my ticket mentioned this ever. It didn't end up being a big deal because thankfully Miami was earlier in the route, so I essentially just got on my scheduled train 2 stops late.</p>

<p></p>

<p>So anyway, I made my way down to the platform to board the train. I should also mention at this point that I was on a conference call from my phone. I had previously connected my phone to the free wifi at the station, and it was plenty good enough for the call. As I went down the escalator to the platform, it broke up a bit in the middle of the escalator, but picked back up once I was on the platform outside.</p>

<p></p>

<p>There were some signs on the platform to indicate "Coach 1", "Coach 2" and "Coach 3" cars. However my ticket was a "Premium" ticket, so I walked to where I assumed the front of the train would be when it pulled up.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I got on the train on the front car marked "SMART" and "3", seats 9-17. It wasn't clear what "SMART" was since I didn't see that option when booking online. My seat was seat 9A, so I wasn't entirely sure I was in the right spot, but I figured better to be on the train than on the platform, so I just went in. We started moving shortly after. As soon as I walked in, I had to walk past the train attendant pushing a beverage cart through the aisles. I made it to seat 9, but it was occupied. I asked the attendant where my seat was, and she said it was in car 1 at the "front", and motioned to the back of the train. I don't know why their cars are in the opposite order you'd expect. So I took my bags back to car 1 where I was finally greeted with the "Premium" sign I was looking for.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I was quickly able to find my seat, which was not in fact occupied. The Premium car was configured with 2 seats on one side and 1 seat on the other side.</p>

 The Brightline Premium Car 

<p></p>

<p>Some of the seats are configured to face each other, so there is a nice variety of seating options. You could all be sitting around a table if you booked a ticket for 4 people, or you could book 2 tickets and sit either next to each other or across from each other.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Since I had booked my ticket so last minute, I had basically the last available seat in the car so I was sitting next to someone. As soon as I sat down, the beverage cart came by with drinks. The cart looked like the same type you'd find on an airplane, and even had some identical warning stickers on it such as the "must be secured for takeoff and landing" sign. The drink options were also similar to what you'd get on a Premium Economy flight service. I opted for a glass of prosecco, and made myself comfortable.</p>

<p>The tray table at the seat had two configurations. You could either drop down a small flap or the whole tray.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>The small tray was big enough to hold a drink or an iPad or phone, but not much else. The large tray was big enough for my laptop with a drink next to it as well as an empty glass or bottle behind it.</p>

<p>Under the seat there was a single power outlet for the 2 seats with 120v power as well as two USB-C ports.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Shortly after I had settled in, the crew came back with a snack tray and handed me these four snacks without really giving me the option of refusing any of them.</p>

<p></p>

<p>At this point I wasn't really hungry since I had just eaten at the airport, so I stuffed the snacks in my bag, except for the prosciutto, which I offered to my seat mate but he refused.</p>

<p>By this point we were well on our way to the Boca Raton stop. A few people got off and on there, and we continued on. I should add here that I always feel a bit unsettled when there is that much movement of people getting on and off all the time. These stops were about 20-30 minutes away from each other, which meant the beginning of the ride I never really felt completely settled in. This is the same reason I prefer a 6 hour flight over two 3 hour flights. I like to be able to settle in and just not think about anything until we arrive.</p>

<p>We finally left the last of the South Florida stops, West Palm Beach, and started the rest of the trip to Orlando. A bunch of people got off at West Palm Beach, enough that the Premium cabin was nearly empty at that point. I was able to move to the seat across the aisle which was a window/aisle seat all to myself!</p>

<p></p>

<p>Finally I could settle in for the long haul. Shortly before 3, the crew came by with the lunch cart. The options were either a vegetarian or non-vegetarian option, so that made the choice easy for me.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The vegetarian option was a tomato basil mozzarella sandwich, a side of fruit salad, and some vegetables with hummus. The hummus was surprisingly good, not like the little plastic tubs you get at the airport. The sandwich was okay, but did have a nice pesto spread on it.</p>

<p>After lunch, I opened up my computer to start writing this post and worked on it for most of the rest of the trip.</p>

<p>As the train started making a left turn to head west, the conductor came on the loudspeaker and made an announcement along the lines of "we're about to head west onto the newest tracks that have been built in the US in 100 years. We'll be reaching 120 miles per hour, so feel free to feel smug as we whiz by the cars on the highway." And sure enough, we really picked up the speed on that stretch! While we had reached 100-120mph briefly during the trip north, that last stretch was a solid 120mph sustained for about 20 minutes!</p>

 Orlando Station 

<p></p>

<p>We finally slowed down and pulled into the Orlando station at the airport.</p>

<p>Disembarking the train was simple enough. This was the last stop of the train so there wasn't quite as much of a rush to get off before the train started again. There's no need to mind the gap as you get off since there's a little platform that extends from the train car.</p>

<p></p>

<p>At the Orlando station there was a short escalator up and then you exit through the automated gates.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I assumed I would have to scan my ticket when exiting but that ended up not being the case. Which actually meant that the only time my ticket was ever checked was when entering the station. I never saw anyone come through to check tickets on the train.</p>

<p>At this point I was already in the airport, and it was a short walk around the corner to the tram that goes directly to the airport security checkpoint.</p>

<p>The whole trip took 176 minutes for 210 miles, which is an average speed of 71 miles per hour. When moving, we were typically moving at anywhere from 80-120 miles per hour.</p>

 Summary 

 
 The whole experience was way nicer than an airplane, I would take this over a short flight from Miami to Orlando any day. 
 It felt similar to a European train, but with service closer to an airline. 
 The service needs to be better timed with the stops when people are boarding. 
 The only ticket check was when entering the station, nobody came to check my ticket or seat on the train, or even when I left the destination station. 
 While the Premium car food and drinks were free, I'm not sure it was worth the $85 extra ticket price over just buying the food you want. 
 Unfortunately the ticket cost was similar to that of budget airlines, I would have preferred the cost to be slightly lower. But even still, I would definitely take this train over a budget airline at the same cost. 
 

<p>We need more high speed trains in the US! I go from Portland to Seattle often enough that a train running every 90 minutes that was faster than a car and easier and more comfortable than an airplane would be so nice!</p>

<a href="https://flickr.com/search/?user_id=52614599%40N00&amp;sort=interestingness-desc&amp;view_all=1&amp;text=united"></a>A few among the countless photos I’ve shot from United Airlines window seats.
<p>I’ve flown 1,500,242 miles with United Airlines. My wife has flown at least a million more. Both of us currently enjoy Premier status, though we’ve spent much of our time with United at the fancier 1K level. We are also both lifetime United Club members and have been so for thirty-three years.</p>
<p>Unlike many passengers of big airlines, we have no complaints about United. The airline has never lost our luggage or mistreated us in any way, even going back decades, to when we were no-status passengers. On the contrary, we like United—especially some of the little things, such as <a href="https://simpleflying.com/united-airlines-channel-9-story/">From the Flight Deck </a>(formerly Channel 9) on some plane entertainment systems, and <a href="https://onemileatatime.com/news/united-free-wifi-tmobile/">free live Internet connections (at least for T-Mobile customers</a>, which we are). And we rolled with it when United, like other airlines, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/united-airlines-mileageplus-program-changes-2022-11?op=1">changed</a> the way frequent fliers earn privileges.</p>
<p>But now comes <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/airlines/united-airlines-weighs-using-passenger-data-to-sell-targeted-ads-21ddb447">United Airlines Weighs Using Passenger Data to Sell Targeted Ads</a>, by <a href="https://www.wsj.com/news/author/patience-haggin">Patience Haggin</a> in The Wall Street Journal. It begins,</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/UAL">United Airlines</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;is considering using its passenger information to help brands serve targeted ads to its customers, joining a growing number of companies trying to tap their troves of user data&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/marriott-rolls-out-media-network-that-lets-brands-reach-travelers-on-its-apps-and-tv-screens-11652698800">for advertising purposes</a>.</p>
<p>Some of these targeted ads could appear on its in-flight entertainment system or on the app that people use to book tickets and check-in, people familiar with the matter said. United hasn’t made a decision yet and may choose not to launch a targeted-advertising business, some of the people said.</p>
<p>Airlines have long taken advantage of the captive nature of their customer base to show them plenty of ads, including commercials on seatback screens, glossy spreads inside in-flight shopping catalogs or, for some, advertisements adorning cabin walls. Offering personalized advertising would greatly expand United’s advertising business, some of the people said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of the 106 comments below the story, all but one opposed the idea, and the one exception said he’d rather not keep seeing ads for feminine hygiene products.</p>
<p>The big question here is whether and how United might share personal data with parties other than itself. Because there are lots of companies that will pay for personal data, and United does have, as Patience says, “an advertising business.”</p>
<p>What exactly is that business? Is it just showing ads to United customers? Or, in the process of now personalizing those ads, is it sharing data about those customers with “partners” in the adtech fecosystem, which has been hostile to personal privacy for decades, as a matter of course?</p>
<p>Just based on this one story (and 99+% of the thumbs-down comments it got), it should be obvious that this is a terrible idea. But, this kind of idea is terribly typical in the marketing world today, and a perfect example of what Cory Doctorow calls <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=doctorow+enshittification&amp;ia=web">enshittification</a>, a label so correct that it has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification">its own Wikipedia article</a>. In&nbsp;The Guardian, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/johnnaughton">John Naughton</a> asks, Why do we tolerate it?</p>
<p>Two reasons—</p>
<p>1) It’s normative in the extreme. As I put it in <a href="https://dsearls.medium.com/separating-advertisings-wheat-and-chaff-47858adfcb20#.i6msx57rv">Separating Advertising’s Wheat and Chaff</a>, “Madison Avenue fell asleep, direct response marketing ate its brain, and it woke up as an alien replica of itself.” Today the entire<a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/digital-advertising/worldwide"> .X $trillion digital advertising business</a> can imagine nothing better than getting personal with everybody. And it totally excuses the tracking required to make it work. Which it doesn’t, most of the time.that</p>
<p>2) Journalists are afraid to bite the beast that feeds them. <a href="https://pagexray.fouanalytics.com/q/www.wsj.com%2Fbusiness%2Fairlines%2Funited-airlines-weighs-using-passenger-data-to-sell-targeted-ads-21ddb447?f=">Here is a PageXray</a> of where personal data about you goes when you visit that story without tracking protection (which most of us don’t have). Here is just one small part of the hundreds of paths that data about you travels out to advertising “partners” of The Wall Street Journal:</p>
<p><a href="https://pagexray.fouanalytics.com/q/www.wsj.com%2Fbusiness%2Fairlines%2Funited-airlines-weighs-using-passenger-data-to-sell-targeted-ads-21ddb447?f="></a></p>
<p>Click on that link, wait for that whole graphic to load, and look around. You won’t recognize most of the names in that vast data river delta, but all of them play parts in a fecosystem that relies entirely on absent personal privacy online. And some of them are extra unsavory. Take <a href="http://moatads.com">moatads.com</a>. Don’t bother going there. Nothing will load. Instead, <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=moatads">look up the name</a>. Nice, huh? (As an aside, why am I, a paying WSJ subscriber, subjected to all this surveillance?)</p>
<p>I’ve challenged many journalists employed by participants in this system to report on it. So far, I’ve seen only one report: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/23/opinion/data-internet-privacy-tracking.html">this one</a> by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/farhad-manjoo">Farhad Manjoo</a> in The New York Times, back in 2019. (The&nbsp;Times&nbsp;backed off after that, but they’re <a href="https://pagexray.fouanalytics.com/q/www.nytimes.com%2F?f=">still at it</a>.)</p>
<p>As for the consent theater of cookie notices, none of “your choices” are meaningful if you have no record of what you’ve “chosen” and you can’t audit compliance. (Who has even thought about that? I can name two entities: <a href="https://customercommons.org/solutions/tools/terms/">Customer Commons</a> and the <a href="https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/7012/7192/">IEEE P7012 working group</a>. My wife and I are involved in both.)</p>
<p>Unless United customers stand up and say NO to this, as firmly and directly as possible, the way to bet is that you’ll start seeing personalized ads for all kinds of stuff on your seat back screens, your United app, and in other places to which data about you has been sold or sent by United, one way or another, to and through who knows. (But you’ll probably find some suspects in that PageXray.) Because that’s how great real-world brands are now enshittifying themselves into the same old fecosystem we’ve had online for decades now.</p>
<p>Hey, it’s happened to <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/electronics/privacy/how-to-turn-off-smart-tv-snooping-features-a4840102036/">TVs</a> and <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/blog/privacy-nightmare-on-wheels-every-car-brand-reviewed-by-mozilla-including-ford-volkswagen-and-toyota-flunks-privacy-test/">cars</a>. (And hell, <a href="https://doc.searls.com/the-adblock-war/">journalism</a>.) Why not to airlines too?</p>

<p>Just before Thanksgiving, <a href="https://www.npr.org/">NPR</a>‘s <a href="https://www.npr.org/programs/all-things-considered/">All Things Considered</a> radio program had a <a href="https://www-cf.npr.org/2023/11/21/1214529474/how-to-keep-an-eye-out-for-cyber-scams-during-this-holiday-shopping-season">short item</a> on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMARC">DMARC</a>, a protocol that attempts to control fraudulent use of internet domains by email spammers by asserting that messages coming from those domains are authenticated using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DomainKeys_Identified_Mail">DKIM</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Policy_Framework">SPF</a>. Since I have been working in that area, a colleague alerted me to the coverage and I listened to it online.</p>



<p>A couple of people asked me about my opinion of the article, which I thought might be of interest to others as well.</p>



 



<p>From the introduction:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>JENNA MCLAUGHLIN, BYLINE: Cybercriminals love the holiday season. The internet is flooded with ads clamoring for shoppers’ attention, and that makes it easier to slip in a scam. At this point, you probably know to watch out for phishing emails, but it might surprise you to know that there’s a tool that’s been around a long time that could help solve this problem. It’s called DMARC – or the Domain Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance Protocol – whew. It’s actually pretty simple. It basically helps prove the sender is who they say they are.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Of course it doesn’t help prove the sender is who they say they are at all, it expresses a request for what to do when the sender doesn’t. But I’ll forgive this one since it’s the interviewer’s misunderstanding.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>ROBERT HOLMES: DMARC seeks to bring trust and confidence to the visible from address of an email so that when you receive an email from an address at wellsfargo.com or bestbuy.com, you can say with absolute certainty it definitely came from them.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>(1) There is no “visible from address”. Most mail user agents (webmail, and programs like Apple Mail) these days leave out the actual email address and only display the “friendly name”, which isn’t verified at all. I get lots of junk email with addresses like:</p>



 From: Delta Airlines &lt;win-Eyiuum8@Eyiuum8-DeltaAirlines.com&gt; 



<p>This of course isn’t going to be affected by Delta’s DMARC policy (which only applies to email with a From address of @delta.com), but a lot of recipients are going to only see “Delta Airlines.” Even if the domain was visible, it’s not clear how much attention the public pays to the domain, compounded by the fact that this one is deceptively constructed.</p>



<p>(2) There is no absolute certainty. Even with a DKIM signature in many cases a bogus <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8601">Authentication-Results</a> header field could be added, or the selector record in DNS could be spoofed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_spoofing">cache poisoning</a>.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>HOLMES: So the thing about good security – it should be invisible to Joe Public.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This seems to imply that the public doesn’t need to be vigilant as long as the companies implement DMARC. Not a good message to send. And of course p=none, which for many domains is the only safe policy to use, isn’t going to change things at all, other than to improve deliverability to Yahoo and Gmail.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>HOLMES: I think the consequences of getting this wrong are severe. Legitimate email gets blocked.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Inappropriate DMARC policies cause a lot of legitimate email blockage as well.</p>



<p>When we embarked on this authentication policy thing (back when we were doing <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc5617/">ADSP</a>), I hoped that it would cause domains to separate their transactional and advertising mail, use different domains or subdomains for those, and publish appropriate policies for those domains. It’s still not perfect, since some receive-side forwarders (e.g., alumni addresses) break DKIM signatures. But what has happened instead is a lot of blanket requirements to publish restrictive DMARC policies regardless of the usage of the domain, such as the <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/directives/bod-18-01-enhance-email-and-web-security">CISA requirement on federal agencies</a>. And of course there has been a big marketing push from DMARC proponents that, in my opinion, encourages domains to publish policies that are in conflict with how their domains are used.</p>



<p>Going back to my earlier comment, I really wonder if domain-based policy mechanisms like DMARC provide significant benefit when the domain isn’t visible. On the other hand, DMARC does cause definite breakage, notably to mailing lists.</p>

  <p>Some riddles are so complex that people just stop contemplating, and concede. Here on the VRM dev list, over many years, the struggle to explain structural concepts in motion has fought for words in a social context that disavows progress by design. There is only one place where "self-induced Sovereignty" is approachable in accurate human terms, and conversing the methods elsewhere, like Canada, Europe, China, or via the modern Administrative State, etc... is a failure at inception, and the process of grabbing the word to apply policy obfuscations on accurate use is intentional. As has been discussed plenty of times, the State-defined "Sovereign citizen movement" is the most dangerous ideology&nbsp;in existence, and the people who live under its definition are the most dangerous people in existence. I mean, have you seen them all out there doing what they do, acting all Sovereign unto themselves? Scary stuff, right?</p> "Human Rights" is another great example, used pervasively in Government administration, and by identity entrepreneurs in aggressively collating the un-identified/&nbsp;un-banked/&nbsp;un-civilized. Powerful words and concepts are always open to perversion by intent, and require courageous stewardship to hold accountable to the actual meaning conferred by utterance. Most western societies operate under the belief that human rights exist, and their society protects them. Yet, in defining the human rights for and unto the human population being administered, the order of operations is strictly accurate, where words documenting process fall well-short.&nbsp;  <br>  In the US, human rights are administered rights. Prior to administration, there is no&nbsp;functional concept of human rights, thats why the UN applies its language to the most vulnerable, children, as it does... an administered right to administration of Nationality and Identity sets the stage for data existence. You, the Individual person, like all the rest of us, have no existence until you are legally administered, despite an ability to observe human existence prior to administration. "Civil Society", like math once did, exists in a state that denies the existence of zero - the unadministered pre-citizen, pre-customer, pre-Righted, pre-identified with actual existence as a human with Rights. Sorry, but you are going to need an administered ID for that.  <br>  If human rights existed, then human migration would be a matter of free expression, and access to Sovereign jurisdictions proclaiming support for "Human Rights" would need to quibble less about process of admittance. Simple in theory, but get ready for the administrative use of fear to induce human behavior in compliance to expected procedures.... "Terrorist Migrants Are Coming!!!!" ... ie, no actual, structural human rights here, move along. Only cult-politics can confront this with policy, as structural human rights have no meaningful expression in structural terms... just linguistics.  <br>  Now in China, who cares... human&nbsp;rights don't exist. The default commie-state of the newborn baby, dependent on others for survival, is extended throughout life. Little commie-baby-brains are the most compliant, most enforceable population on the planet, and structural considerations of participation are not to be found - bring on the social credit score. At home, or in the hospital, newborn families are not inherently tuned to the structural considerations of a new born&nbsp;life, they are tired, exhausted, hopefully in glee at the newly arriving human they have custody for. This is where the heist occurs. Systems love compliant people, they can do anything with them as their fodder.&nbsp;  <br>  Data collection starts immediately; afterall, that new baby needs administered existence in order to exist with rights. Right?&nbsp;  <br>  Data plantations running on endless databases, storing administered credentials in State Trusts, set the stage for the participation of living beings that will one day wake in a world that they themselves will have custody for,&nbsp;in theory. But in that moment, those little commie-baby-brains need to be administered by the State, need to be defined by State identification processes, in order to exist legally, and as a function of the future, those theories will yield to administered practices.  <br>  Structure yields results...&nbsp;  <br>  How many people care? As "we" look around and communicate on this list, W2 employees with pensions become pervasive in all of these conversations. These structural participants, one-level removed from their Righted structure as citizens, even within "more perfect Sovereign unions", form sub-unions protecting their continuity as structural outcomes. What outcomes? What is the structural outcome they achieve? Like little commie-baby-brains, these adult participants cede their self-Sovereign integrity and representation, to induce group-action via group-think and group-coordination. It works really well, and makes these people "feel" really powerful in their time and place, inducing actions that try to scale their structural considerations for all people who remain out-of-step.  <br>  Thats where "You" come in, and by example, where a more perfect union comes in, to protect the greatest minority, and default sub-unit of the human organism, the Individual. Here, the commie-baby-brain must stand accountable to the inherent structural integrity of an Individual human life with direct, personal living authority. Personal authority, the kind that really makes little adult-commie-brains upset as "people"&nbsp;who can't/don't/won't be able to express such authority with any confidence, and without any guidance from a group-administrator. You see it all the time, as the administrative system routs&nbsp;one attention to channel 4 for programming, and channel 5 for another. Cult-capture is structurally assured by design, a coup by actual intent.&nbsp;  <br>  This sets the backdrop of work and conversation here. There are too many people on this list that will NEVER materialize an accurate understanding of the structural accuracy of human rights, and the Sovereign structure of human liberty and accountability, the kind that builds real "civil" societies. Instead, they will pervert words, quibble&nbsp;against words, use fear to harm dialogue, and insist on centralized authority to secure people from themselves, and the most scary people on the planet... people who think and act for themselves to stand up Sovereign jurisdictions as self-represented participants and sources of Sovereign authority.&nbsp;  <br>  Too hard? Too old? Too young? Too compliant? Too accurate?&nbsp;  <br>  Prior to any administrative act, actual human rights exist. (<a href="https://www.moxytongue.com/2023/10/zero-party-doctrine.html">Zero Party Doctrine</a>) Good people, with functionally literate adult minds, and the persistent choice to preserve human health, wealth, wisdom, liberty, and personal pursuits of happiness in time serve as the actual foundation of a dominant world-view with no equal. Own your own life, own your own work, own your own future, own your own administration as righted people in civil societies. The alternative is not civil, and not humane to Individuals, all people. Structure yields superior results....  <br>  As builders of AI systems serving such people, structural considerations trump hype. I will stop short of discussing technical methods ensuring such outcomes, but suffice it to say it is a choice to induce unending focus on such outcomes. It requires no marketing, it requires no venture capital, and it wins because it is supported by winners. People, Individuals&nbsp;all, who give accountability personally to the freedoms they express incrementally in the face of far too ample losers who are always one comma away from proclaiming your adult minds a threat to the existence of their little commie-baby-brains while begging for access to the world built by self-Sovereign efforts of leaders, the real kind.  <br>  AI is about raising the bottom up to the statistical mean in present form. Protecting leading edge human thought, and output, is going to require a new approach to human identity. Databases are the domain of AI, and humanity will not be able to compete as artifacts living on a databased plantation.&nbsp;  <br>  A great civil society reset is required (Not the "Build Back Better" commie-baby-brain variety), and it is just a matter of time before it becomes essential for any person now participating in the masses as little commie-baby-brains despite believing "they" exist in some other way as a result of linguistics or flag flying. Watch the administration process devolve, as people, the bleeding kind, are conflated with "people", the linguistic variety, and have their "Rights" administered as "permissions" due to some fear-inducing event. Well documented on this list by pseudo-leaders.  <br>  Open source AI, local AI, rooted human authority... all in the crosshairs. Remember who you are up against. Universal derivation and sharing no longer exist in the same place at the same time. Declare your structural reality.. human Individual leader, or statistical mean on a data-driven plantation. It is still not optional. People, Indiviiduals all, must own root authority.

For example, the image above is generated by DALL-E. I think generative AI is going to upend almost everything we do online, and <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/AI-agents">I'm not alone</a>. One of the places it will have the greatest impact is its uses in personal agents whether or not these agents enable people to lead effective online lives.</p><p>Jamie Smith recently wrote a <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/customerfutures/p/digital-agents-bill-gates-vs-customer">great article in Customer Futures about the </a><a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/customerfutures/p/digital-agents-bill-gates-vs-customer">kind of AI-enabled personal agents</a> we should be building. As Jamie points out: "Digital identity [is how we] prove who we are to others"​​. This statement is particularly resonant as we consider not just the role of digital identities in enhancing personal agents, but also their crucial function in asserting ownership of our creations in an AI-dominated landscape.</p><p>Personal agents, empowered by AI, will be integral to our digital interactions, managing tasks and providing personalized experiences. As Bill Gates says, <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/AI-agents">AI is about to completely change how you use computers</a>. The key to the effectiveness of these personal agents lies in the robust digital identities they leverage. These identities are not just tools for authentication; they're pivotal in distinguishing our human-generated creations from those produced by AI.</p><p>In creative fields, for instance, the ability to prove ownership of one's work becomes increasingly vital as AI-generated content proliferates. A strong digital identity enables creators to unequivocally claim their work, ensuring that the nuances of human creativity are not lost in the tide of AI efficiency. Moreover, in sectors like healthcare and finance, where personal agents are entrusted with sensitive tasks, a trustworthy, robust, self-sovereign identity ensures that these agents act in harmony with our real-world selves, maintaining the integrity and privacy of our personal data.</p><p>In this AI-centric era, proving authorship through digital identity becomes not just a matter of pride but a shield against the rising tide of AI-generated fakes. As artificial intelligence becomes more adept at creating content—from written articles to artwork—the line between human-generated and AI-generated creations blurs. A robust, owner-controlled digital identity acts as a bastion, enabling creators to assert their authorship and differentiate their genuine work from AI-generated counterparts.

<p>Tomorrow (well today, since I’m ten minutes late in getting this posted) is Thanksgiving in the United States. I’ve had mixed feelings about it since the February 2017 raid on Standing Rock where Regina Brave made her treaty stand. After watching MRAPs coming down a muddy, snowy hill to confront a Lakota grandmother and Navy veteran on Unicorn Riot’s livestream, it was hard to go back to being a parade bystander. It didn’t feel right watching the Major Drumstick float go by as we took in drum corps performances and waited for Santa to make his appearance on the Ben Franklin Parkway, officially opening the season of holiday excess. To be honest, I was kind of a downer.</p>
<p>Six years later, I have more life experience and clarity around cognitive domain management, identity politics, prediction modeling, and the strategic use of drama and trauma. I sense now that Standing Rock was likely part of an unfolding spectacle that was intended to set the stage for the use of indigenous identity as cover for faux green sustainability markets linked to web3 natural capital – the rights of nature literally tethered to digital ledgers in the name of equity and acknowledgement of past harms. </p>
<p>That is not to say protester concerns around the threats of pipelines to water systems weren’t valid. They were. It is not to dismiss the injustice of broken treaties, to diminish the horror of violence waged against native bodies, to undermine authentic efforts towards being in right relationship with the Earth and one another. No, the reasons people came to Standing Rock mattered. They did, but I expect few who participated would have ever realized the community that arose on that icy riverbank was viewed by myriad analysts as an emergent complex system, an extremely valuable case study at a time when we were on the cusp of AI swarm intelligence and cognitive warfare.</p>
<p>I’d come to know a man through my education activism who was there on the day of the raid, a person I considered a friend and mentor. We’ve drifted apart since the lockdowns. Such digital entanglements now seem pervasive and ephemeral. Were we really friends? Was it an act? In some extended reality play? Part of some larger campaign meant to position us where we were supposed to be years hence? I don’t think we’re meant to know. Perhaps like “degrees of freedom,” “degrees of uncertainty” are baked into the “many-worlds” equations humming within the data center infrastructure spewing out today’s digital twin multiverses. In any event, his research opened the door of my mind to the quiet, devastating treachery of social impact finance as well as the vital importance of indigenous spiritual practice and sovereignty. His ties to Utah’s complex and troubled history, a place that birthed virtual worlds of encrypted teapots under craggy mountains soaked in radioactive star dust on the shores of crystalline salt lakes sitting atop vast stores of transmitting copper ore, spun me into the space where I am now.</p>
<p>Looking back I held a simmering anger that hurt my family in ways I did not realize. It was probably an energetic frequency. We didn’t talk about it. We didn’t argue. Everything was fine, until lockdowns happened and suddenly it wasn’t. I felt betrayed having been what I considered a “good citizen” doing all the right things for so many decades and then abruptly having the scales fall from my eyes. This culture to which I had been habituated wasn’t at all what I thought it was. Nonetheless we were supposed to continue to perform our assigned roles as if nothing had changed. As long as we kept saying the assigned lines, things in middle-class progressive America would be ok. I was expected to paper over the rifts that were opening up in reality as I had known it, tuck away my disenchantment, my questions. Once one domino fell, they would all go, and that would be incredibly painful to everyone around me. And anyway, I didn’t have an answer that would reconcile the inconsistencies ready in my back pocket. There was a sad logic in it. If there was no easy fix, why wreck the status quo? Surely that wasn’t doing anyone any favors, right?</p>
<p>Nothing turned out like I thought it would. Suddenly, I was a planner without a plan. Today I have lots more information, and if anything, I recognize that I know less than I need to – that is than my mind needs to. In a world of information you can never pin it all down, organize it, make sense of it from an intellectual standpoint. But maybe it’s time to lead with the heart, at least that’s what all the techno-bros are saying. Maybe I should just shrug and let Sophia the robot guide me into some transformative meditation? Well, probably not. And I’ll pass on the Deepak Chopra wellness app, too. I foresee a future where rocks and water and trees are my partners in biophotonic exchange. At least that is what feels right for now. Patience.</p>
<p>For the moment I am on my own. I still love my small family with all my heart, and I really miss my dad every day. I have his watch with the scent of his Polo cologne on the band. It makes me tear up, a mix of poignant loss, and remembering hugs in his strong arms. It’s funny since I seem to have fallen outside of “civilized” time now. The days all run into one another and mostly I’m just aware of the contours of the seasons as I wait for the next phase of my life to start in the spring. Oh, that watch – there is a sense of irony in the universe for sure, a trickster energy I have to learn to appreciate more.</p>
<p>I have a small turkey brining in the fridge. I’ll be eating alone, but that’s ok. I don’t feel pressured to make all the fixings – sweet potatoes and broccoli will be fine. Maybe this weekend I’ll make an apple pie, my dad’s favorite. I’m downsizing. I’m leaning into less is more. I’m going to work on seeing playfulness in the world and practicing ways to embody the type of consciousness that might bring more of it in. I have a new friend, we’ll just say my Snake Medicine Show buddy who has been practicing this art for many years in a quest to move into right relationship and, well maybe vanquish is too strong a word, but at least neutralize what she calls the McKracken consciousness. She’s the kind of fun friend you want to have around to riff off of one another. I’m fortunate to have a small group of people in my life who despite my oddities manage to vibe with far-out concepts that stretch well beyond not only the norm, but a lot of the alternative modes of thinking. We are learning, together.</p>
<p>So for tomorrow I will concentrate on being grateful. Indigenous worldviews center gratitude. In spite of all of the disruptions to my year, I still have many blessings. Those who read my blog and watch my long videos, I count you among them. Thank you. Below is the stream we ran last night. It is the first in what will probably be an ongoing series about our trip from Colorado to Arkansas and back. My relocation plans are centered around Hot Springs now, so if you are in the area or have insight, do send them my way. I will include a map I made that weaves together photos from the trip and historical materials.

Underneath I’m sharing a write up I did of insights gifted to me by my Snake Medicine Show friend. I love new tools for my toolbox. Maybe you will find it helpful on your journey.</p>

<p>My summary of insights from Snake Medicine Show who gifted me with a guest post last December. You can read her lively linguistic offering, Emotional Emancipation – A Prayer of Proclamation, <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2022/12/13/labyrinthian-reflections-healing-verses-from-moab-utah/">here</a>.</p>
<p>We’ve been conditioned to perceive the world from a perspective that prioritizes matter. Such a view reduces our lived experience to leaderboards where our value is measured by the things we acquire objects, stuff, credentials, prestige. And yet an open invitation has been extended. We can try on different lens. What if we shift our worldview to center the dynamic potential of energy in motion. Rather than getting entangled by inconsequential nodes popping up here and there within the universe’s vast current, we can join as partners in a cosmic dance of fluid motion and unlimited possibility.</p>
<p>As authentic beings, grounded in truth, attuned to nature and the wonders of cosmic creation, we have the opportunity to dip into that current and reflect imaginative constructs into our shared reality. We are prisms of abundance.</p>
<p>The sea of shared consciousness is mutable, playful, and emergent. We can invite ideas into this dimension. However, once we do so, we have the responsibility to nurture them by giving them focused attention. Through creative partnerships, we can bring more energy to the process than we can acting on our own. As dancers in the current we hold space together, wombs to sustain modes of being beyond our conditioned expectations. We can choose to be patient and await what unfolds.</p>
<p>With proper tuning we will encounter guidance, grace, that directs us towards actions furthering a larger purpose. We many not even be fully aware of what that purpose is. As playful co-creators we should have faith and hold space for circuits to connect, activating the generative feedback that can begin to heal zero-sum consciousness. Mingle our unique bioenergetic frequencies with the understanding that resonant harmonies will guide sacred signals to the right receptor(s). It doesn’t take much to activate healing, just the right amount.</p>
<p>Show up with right relationship and the current will meet us there. We don’t need to know the right time or place; we just need to embody the right tune.</p>

<p>It was really nice of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabethgarber/">Elizabeth Garber</a> to acknowledge me in the whitepaper that she co-authored with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-haine/">Mark Haine</a> titled “<a href="https://openid.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Human-Centric_Digital_Identity_Final-v1.1.pdf">Human-Centric Digital Identity: for Government Officials</a>”. I recommend everyone read it, even if you aren’t in government, as it is a very strong and considerate effort to try and tackle a broad, complicated, but important topic. It reminded me that I was overdue to publish the talk I gave at <a href="https://identiverse.com/idv23/session/1361547/">Identiverse 2023</a>, since it was her being in the audience that led us to have some nice conversations about our shared viewpoint on how Value-Sensitive Design and Human-Centric Design are key cogs in building ethical and inclusive digital identity systems. So, below is a re-recording of my talk, “Collision Course: Ethics vs Human-Centered Design in the New Perimeter”.</p>



 

 



<p>This talk was a challenging one for me to put together, because the subject matter is something I’ve been struggling to come to grips with. With digital identity becoming a critical component of a more digital-centric world, it seems clear that success and sustainability hinges on placing people and their societal values at the center of the architecture. But in doing so as part of my day-to-day work, I sometimes find the principles of human-centered design, inclusion, privacy-by-design, and ethics coming into conflict with each other. How are we, as identity practitioners, supposed to resolve these conflicts, navigating the challenge of building for the world that people actually live in, and not the one we wished they lived in? I increasingly found that there was no blueprint, no guide, already existing that I could tap into.</p>



<p>Well, I’ve often found that nothing brings things into better focus than being forced to develop a talk around it, so that’s what I set out to do. Can’t say I have the answers, but I did try to lay out some approaches and ideas that I found helpful when faced with these questions in the global projects I’m involved in. As always, I would love to hear people’s thoughts and experiences as they relate to this topic.</p>

<p>This article shows how an ASP.NET Core application can be authenticated using OpenID Connect and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9126">OAuth 2.0 Pushed Authorization Requests (PAR) RFC 9126</a>. The OpenID Connect server is implemented using Duende IdentityServer. The Razor Page ASP.NET Core application authenticates using an OpenID Connect confidential client with PKCE and using the OAuth PAR extension.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/oidc-par-aspnetcore-duende">https://github.com/damienbod/oidc-par-aspnetcore-duende</a></p>



<p>Note: The code in this example was created using the Duende example found here: <a href="https://github.com/DuendeSoftware/IdentityServer">https://github.com/DuendeSoftware/IdentityServer</a></p>







<p></p>



<p>By using Pushed Authorization Requests (PAR), the authentication flow security is improved. In ASP.NET Core using PAR, the application is authenticated on the trusted backchannel before sending any authentication request. The parameters are no longer sent in the URL reducing the risk by not sharing the parameters or prevent parameter pollution with redirect_uri injection. No parameters are shared in the front channel.  The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework: JWT-Secured Authorization Request (JAR) <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9101/">RFC 9101</a> can also be used together with this to further improve the authentication security.</p>



 Overview 



<p>The OAuth PAR extension adds an extra step to the two step OpenID Connect client authentication code flow. OAuth Pushed Authorization Requests (PAR) extended flow has three steps:</p>



 
 Client sends a HTTP request in the back channel with the authorization parameters and the client is authenticated first. The body of the request has the OpenID Connect code flow parameters. The server responds with the request_uri. 



 The client uses the request_uri from the first step and authenticates. The server uses the flow parameters from the first request. As code flow with PKCE is used, the code is returned in the front channel. 



 The client completes the authentication using the code flow in the back channel, standard OpenID Connect code flow with PKCE. 
 



 Duende IdentityServer setup 



<p>I used Duende IdentityServer to implement the standard. Any OpenID Connect server which supports the OAuth PAR standard can be used. It is very simple to support this using Duende IdentityServer. The RequirePushedAuthorization is set to true and PAR is active for this client. The rest of the client configuration is a standard OIDC confidential client using code flow with PKCE.</p>


  new Client[]
{
  new Client
  {
	ClientId = "web-par",
	ClientSecrets = 
	{ 
		new Secret("--your-secret--".Sha256()) 
	},

	RequirePushedAuthorization = true,

	AllowedGrantTypes = GrantTypes.CodeAndClientCredentials,

	RedirectUris = 
	{ 
		"https://localhost:5007/signin-oidc" 
	},
	FrontChannelLogoutUri = 
		"https://localhost:5007/signout-oidc",
	PostLogoutRedirectUris = 
	{ 
		"https://localhost:5007/signout-callback-oidc" 
	},

	AllowOfflineAccess = true,
	AllowedScopes = { "openid", "profile" }
  }
};
  


<p></p>



 ASP.NET Core OpenID Connect client 



<p>The ASP.NET Core client requests extra changes. An extra back channel PAR request is sent in the OpenID Connect events. The OIDC events needs to be changed compared to the standard core OIDC setup. I used the Duende.AccessTokenManagement.OpenIdConnect nuget package to implement this and updated the OIDC events using the ParOidcEvents class from the Duende examples. The setup uses the PAR events in the AddOpenIdConnect configuration which requires a HttpClient and the IDiscoveryCache interface from Duende.</p>


  services.AddTransient&lt;ParOidcEvents&gt;();

// Duende.AccessTokenManagement.OpenIdConnect nuget package
services.AddSingleton&lt;IDiscoveryCache&gt;(_ =&gt; 
    new DiscoveryCache(configuration["OidcDuende:Authority"]!));

services.AddHttpClient();

services.AddAuthentication(options =&gt;
{
    options.DefaultScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    options.DefaultChallengeScheme = OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
})
.AddCookie(CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme, options =&gt;
{
    options.ExpireTimeSpan = TimeSpan.FromHours(8);
    options.SlidingExpiration = false;
    options.Events.OnSigningOut = async e =&gt;
    {
        // automatically revoke refresh token at signout time
        await e.HttpContext.RevokeRefreshTokenAsync();
    };
})
.AddOpenIdConnect(OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme, options =&gt;
{
    options.Authority = configuration["OidcDuende:Authority"];
    options.ClientId = configuration["OidcDuende:ClientId"];
    options.ClientSecret = configuration["OidcDuende:ClientSecret"];
    options.ResponseType = "code";
    options.ResponseMode = "query";
    options.UsePkce = true;

    options.Scope.Clear();
    options.Scope.Add("openid");
    options.Scope.Add("profile");
    options.Scope.Add("offline_access");
    options.GetClaimsFromUserInfoEndpoint = true;
    options.SaveTokens = true;
    options.MapInboundClaims = false;

    // needed to add PAR support
    options.EventsType = typeof(ParOidcEvents);

    options.TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
    {
        NameClaimType = "name",
        RoleClaimType = "role"
    };
});

// Duende.AccessTokenManagement.OpenIdConnect nuget package
// add automatic token management
services.AddOpenIdConnectAccessTokenManagement();
  


<p></p>



<p>The ParOidcEvents class is used to implement the events required by the OAuth PAR standard. This can be used with any token server which supports the standard.</p>

 Notes 



<p>It is simple to use PAR and the it adds an improved authentication security with one extra request in the authentication flow. This should be used if possible. The standard can be used together with the OAuth JAR standard and even extended with the OAuth RAR. </p>

<p>Towards the end of 2019, I was invited to deliver a keynote at the OpenID Foundation Summit in Japan. At a very personal level, the January 2020 Summit was an opportunity to spend time with dear friends from around the world. It would be the last time I saw Kim Cameron in person. It would include a dinner with the late Vittorio Bertocci. And it was my last “big” trip before the COVID lock down.</p>



<p>At the Summit, I was asked to talk about the “<a href="https://www.tuesdaynight.org/2020/11/24/the-future-of-digital-identity-2020-2030/">Future of Identity</a>.” It was a bit of a daunting topic since I am no real futurist and haven’t been an industry analyst for a long time. So I set about writing what I thought the next 10 years would look like from the view of a practitioner. You can read what I wrote as well as see a version of me presenting this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A concept I put forward in that talk was one of “counselors”: software agents that act on one’s behalf to make introductions of the individual to a service and vice versa, perform recognition of these services and associated credentials, and prevent or at least inhibit risky behavior, such as dodgy data sharing. I provide an overview of these concepts in my&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/4ZPvWC4Kcbw?t=1217">Future of Identity talk at approximately minute 20</a>.</p>



 Why even talk about counselors 



<p>That’s a reasonable question. I have noticed that there is a tendency in the digital identity space (and I am sure in others too) to marvel at problems. Too many pages spent talking about how something is a fantastically hard problem to solve and why we must do so… with scant pages of follow up on&nbsp;how&nbsp;we do so. Additionally, there’s another tendency to marvel at very technical products and services that “solve the problem.” Except they don’t. They solve a part of the problem or they are one of many tools needed to solve the problem. The challenges of digital identity management are legion and they manifest themselves in different ways to different industry sectors in different geographies. One can argue that while we have used magnificent tools to solve account management problems, we really haven’t begun to solve identity management ones. Counselors are a way to both humanize online interactions and make meaningful (as in meaningful and valuable to the individual) progress on solving the challenges of digital identity management.</p>







 Counselors in the Modern Era 



<p>Sitting through the sessions at&nbsp;<a href="https://authenticatecon.com/event/authenticate-2023/">Authenticate 2023</a>, and being surrounded by a ton of super smart people, I realized that the tools to make counselors real are very much within our grasp. Among these tools, 4 are the keys to success:</p>



 
 Interface layer powered by generative AI and LLMs 



 Bilateral recognition tokens powered by passkeys 



 Potentially verifiable data powered by Verified Credentials 



 Safe browsing hints 
 



 Interface layer powered by generative AI and LLMs 



<p>At their core, counselors are active clients that run on a person’s device. Today we can think of these akin to personal digital assistants, password managers, and digital wallets. What is missing is a user interface layer that is more than a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teddy_Ruxpin">Teddy Ruxpin</a>&nbsp;clone that only knows a few key phrases and actions accompanied by zero contextual awareness. What is needed is a meaningful conversational interface that is contextually aware. Generative AI and large language models (LLMs) are showing promise that they can power that layer. And these models are now running on form factors that could easily be mobile, wearable, and eventually implantable. This would enable the counselor to understand requests such as “Find me the best price for 2 premium economy seats to Tokyo for these dates in January” and “know” that I’ll be flying out of D.C. and am a Star Alliance flier.&nbsp;</p>



 Recognition tokens powered by passkeys 



<p>We have got to get out of the authentication business. It fails dramatically and spectacularly and seemingly on a daily basis. We have to move to the business of enabling service providers and consumers to recognise each other. Both the original talk and my more recent&nbsp;<a href="https://weaveidentity.com/blog/2023/07/19/ceremonies/">Ceremonies</a>&nbsp;talk speak to this need. A crucial puzzle piece for recognition is the use of cryptography. Right now the easiest way a normal human being can use cryptography to “prove” who they are is WebAuthn and, more generally,&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">passkeys</a>. Armed with passkeys, a counselor can ensure that a service recognizes the person and that the counselor recognizes the service. To be clear, today, passkeys and the ceremonies and experiences surrounding them are in the early stages of&nbsp; global adoption… but it is amazing to see the progress that happened in the prior year and it bodes well for the future.</p>



<p>One thing to note is that passkeys as they work today provide a form of cryptographic proof that the thing interacting with a service is the same one you saw the day before, and notional there is the same human associated with the thing. There is no real reason why, in theory, this couldn’t be flipped around such that the service has to provide a form of cryptographic proof that the service is the same one with which the thing interacted the day before. A counselor could broker these kinds of flows to ensure that the service recognizes the person that the counselor is working on behalf of and the counselor can recognize the service.</p>



 Potentially verifiable data powered by verifiable credentials 



<p>One thing a counselor needs to do is to share data, on behalf of the individual, with a service. This data could be credit card information, home address, passport number, etc. Some of the data they would need to share are pieces of information about the individual from 3rd party authorities such as a local department of motor vehicles or employer. Ideally, the service would like a means to verify such information, and the individual, in some cases, would like the issuer of the information not to know where the information is shared. Here verified credentials (VCs) could play a role. Additionally, the service may want information about an individual that the individual provides and acts as the authority/issuer. Here too verified credentials could play a role. Standardized request and presentation patterns and technologies are crucially important and my hope is the VCs will provide them.</p>



<p>So why include the word “potentially” in the title of this section? There are many scenarios in which the service neither needs nor cares to&nbsp; verify information provided by the individual. Said differently, not every use case is a high assurance use case (nor should it be) and not every use case is rooted in a regulated sector. Hopefully VCs will provide a standardized (or at least standardizable) means for data presentation that can span both use cases that require verification and those that do not. If not, we’ll always have&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/0NFanER0g8w?t=322">CSV</a>.</p>



 Safe interaction hints 



<p>While one’s street sense might warn you that walking down that dark alley or getting money from that shifty looking ATM isn’t a good idea, an online version of that same street sense isn’t as easily cultivated. Here we need to turn to outside sources. Signals such as suspect certificates, questionable privacy policies, and known malware drop sites can all be combined to inform the individual everything from “This isn’t the site you actually are looking for” to “I suggest you do not sign up on this service… here are 3 alternatives” to “I’ll generate a one-time credit card number for you here.” One can imagine multiple sources for such hints and services. From browser makers to government entities to privacy-oriented product companies and well beyond. This is where real differentiation and competition can and should occur. And this is where counselors move from being reasonably inert cold storage layers for secrets and data to real valuable tools for an online world.</p>



 The missing something: privacy&nbsp; 



<p>At this point, I felt like I had identified the critical ingredients for a counselor: interface layer, recognition tokens, potentially verifiable data, and safe browsing hints… and then I mentioned this to Nat Sakimura. Nat has a way of appearing at the critical moment, say 10 words, and disrupt your way of thinking. I joke that he’s from the future here to tell us what not to do in order to avoid catastrophe. And I have been lucky and privileged enough to have Nat appear from time to time.</p>



<p>This time he appeared to tell me that the four things I had identified were insufficient. There was something missing. Having safe browsing hints is not enough… what is missing are clear, processable and actionable statements about privacy and data use. A counselor can “read” these statements from a site or service, interpret them into something understandable for the individual, better informing them on how the service will behave, or at least how it ought to behave. Couple this with things like consent receipts, which the counselor can manage, and the individual has records of what the service provider said they would do and to what the individual agreed to. There is an opportunity here for counselors to focus the individual’s attention on what is material for the individual and learn their preferences, such as knowing the individual will not accept tracking cookies.</p>



 From where will these counselors come 



<p>One can easily imagine a variety of sources of counselors. The mobile operating system vendors are best-placed to extend their existing so-called smart assistants to become counselors by leveraging their existing abilities to manage passwords, passkeys, debit and credit cards, and along with other forms of credentials. 3rd parties also could build counselors much like we see with digital assistants, password managers, and digital wallets. I expect that there is a marketplace for services, especially safe browsing hints. Here, organizations from government entities to civil society organizations to privacy-oriented product companies could build modules, for lack of a better word, that would be leveraged by the counselor to enhance its value to the individual.</p>



<p>Regardless of where counselors originate, observability and auditability is key. An individual needs a means to examine the actions the automated counselor took and the reasons for the actions. They need a way to revoke past data sharing decisions and consents granted. And they need a means to “fire” their counselor and switch to a new one whilst retaining access, control, and history.</p>



 In conclusion 



<p>We, as an industry, have been working on identity management for quite some time. But, from some perspectives, we haven’t made progress. Pam Dingle once said something to me to the effect of, “We’ve built a lot of tools but we haven’t solved the problems. We are just at the point where we have the tools we need to do so.” We have solved many of the problems of user account management, but we have yet to solve the problems of identity management to the same extent. The magical future where I can put the supercomputer on my wrist to work in a way that delivers real value and not just interesting insights and alerts feels both disappointingly far away yet tantalizingly within our grasp. I believe that counselors are what is needed to extend our reach to that magical, and very achievable, future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To do this I believe there are five things required:</p>



 
 Ubiquitous devices, available to all regardless of geography and socio economic condition, in all manner of form factors, which can run privacy-preserving LLMs and thus the interface layer for counselors 



 Maturation of passkey patterns including recovery use cases such that the era of shared secrets can be enshrined in history 



 Standardization of request and presentation processes of potentially verifiable data, along with standardized data structures 



 Trustable sources of safe interaction signals with known rules and standardized data formats 



 Machine-readable and interpretable privacy and data use notices coupled with consent receipts 
 



<p>The tools we need to unlock the magical future are real… or certainly real enough for proof of concept purposes. Combining those five ingredients makes the magical future and much more magical present… and this is the present in which I want to be.</p>

<p>It is a testament to his enduring spirit that we all continue to find ways to cope with the absence of Vittorio from our identity community and from our lives. On the day that I learnt of the news, I poured out my immediate feelings <a href="https://blog.talkingidentity.com/2023/10/and-just-like-that-hes-gone.html">in words</a>. But as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/iglazer/">Ian</a> put it so eloquently (like only he can), we continued to look for ways to operationalize our sadness. In his case, he and Allan Foster set out to honor Vittorio’s legacy by setting up <a href="https://digitalidadvancement.org/awards-and-grants/vittorio/">the Vittorio Bertocci Award</a> under the auspices of <a href="https://digitalidadvancement.org/">the Digital Identity Advancement Foundation</a>, which hopefully will succeed in becoming a lasting tribute to the intellect and compassion that Vittorio shared with the identity community. My personal attempt was to try and remember the (often twisted yet somehow endearingly innocent) sense of humor that Vittorio imbued into our personal interactions. And so, prodded by the inquiries from many about the fun (and funny) t-shirt I had designed just to get a good laugh from him at Identiverse, I created <a href="https://www.customink.com/fundraising/in-memory-of-vittorio-our-identity-fabio">a fundraiser</a> for the <a href="https://pancan.org/">Pancreatic Cancer Action Network</a> in his honor.</p>



 



<a href="https://7ee14c.p3cdn1.secureserver.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Screen-Shot-2023-11-14-at-9.46.29-AM.png"></a>



 



<p>Thanks to all of you Vittorio stans and your incredible generosity, we raised $3,867.38 through t-shirt orders ($917.63) and donations ($2,949.75). I am obviously gratified by the support you gave my little attempt at operationalizing my sadness. But the bonus I wasn’t expecting was the messages people left on the fundraiser site – remembering Vittorio, what he meant to them, and in some cases how cancer affected their lives personally. In these troubling times, it was heartwarming to read these small signals of our shared humanity.</p>



<p>Thank you all once again. And love you Vittorio, always.</p>

The join was failing because the two network_interfaces columns contained JSONB objects with differing shapes; Postgres’ JSONB containment operator, @&gt;, couldn’t match them. Since the JSONB objects are arrays, and since the desired match was a key/value pair common to both arrays, it made sense to explode the array and iterate through its elements looking to match that key/value pair.</p>
<p>Initial solutions from ChatGPT, Copilot Chat, and newcomer Unblocked implemented that strategy using various flavors of cross joins involving Postgres’ jsonb_array_elements function.

  I recently read Igor Shadurin's article Dive Into dApps. In it, he defines a dApp (or decentralized application): The commonly accepted definition of a dApp is, in short, an application that can operate autonomously using a distributed ledger system.

In it, he defines a dApp (or decentralized application):</p><blockquote><p>The commonly accepted definition of a dApp is, in short, an application that can operate autonomously using a distributed ledger system.</p><p>From <a href="https://hackernoon.com/dive-into-dapps-your-ultimate-guide-to-start-crafting-them-today">Dive Into dApps</a><br>Referenced 2023-11-12T15:39:42-0500</p></blockquote><p>I think that definition is too specific to blockchains. Blockchains are an implementation choice and there are other ways to solve the problem. That said, if you're looking to create a dApp with a smart contract, then Igor's article is a nice place to start.</p><p>Let's start with the goal and work backwards from there. The goal of a dApp is to give people control over their apps and the data in them. This is not how the internet works today. As I wrote in <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2014/04/the_compuserve_of_things.shtml">The CompuServe of Things</a>, the web and mobile apps are almost exclusively built on a model of <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml#administrative">intervening administrative authorities</a>. As the operators of hosted apps and controllers of the identity systems upon which they're founded,  the administrators can, for any reason whatsoever, revoke your rights to the application and any data it contains. Worse, most use your data for their own purposes, often in ways that are not in your best interest.</p><p>dApps, in contrast, give you control of the data and merely operate against it. Since they don't host the data, they can <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2023/11/cloudless_computing_at_the_edge.shtml">run locally, at the edge</a>. Using smart contracts on a blockchain is one way to do this, but there are others, including peer-to-peer networks and InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). The point is, to achieve their goal, dApps need a way to store data that the application can reliably and securely reference, but that a person, rather than the app provider, controls. The core requirement for achieving control is that the data service be run by a provider who is not an intermediary and that the data model be <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2014/03/substitutability_is_an_indispensable_property_for_the_internet_of_things.shtml">substitutable</a>. Control requires meaningful choice among a group of interoperable providers who are substitutable and compete for the trust of their customers.</p><p>I started writing about this idea back in 2012 and called it <a href="https://www.windley.com/tags/pcaa">Personal Cloud Application Architecture</a>. At the time the idea of personal clouds had a lot of traction and a number of supporters. We built a demonstration app called <a href="https://www.windley.com/liveweb/forever/forever.shtml">Forever</a> and later, I based the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2013/10/fuse_connecting_your_car_-_our_new_kickstarter_campaign.shtml">Fuse connected car application</a> on this idea: let people control and use the data from their cars without an intermediary. Fuse's technical success showed the efficacy of the idea at scale. Fuse had a mobile app and felt like any other connected car application, but underneath the covers, the architecture gave control of the data to the car's owner. Dave Winer has also <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2015/01/nodestorage_and_the_personal_cloud_application_architecture.shtml">developed applications that use a substitutable backend storage based on Node</a>.</p><p>Regular readers will wonder how I made it this far without mentioning <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2022/07/the_most_inventive_thing_ive_done.shtml">picos</a>. Forever and Fuse were both based on picos. Picos are designed to be self-hosted or hosted by providers who are substitutable. I've got a couple of projects tee'd up for two groups of students this winter that will further extend the suitability for picos as backends for dApps:</p>  <p>Support for Hosting Picos—the root pico in any instance of the pico engine is the ancestor of all picos in that engine and thus has ultimate control over them. To date, we've used the ability to stand up a new engine and control access to it as the means of providing control for the owner. This project will allow a hosting provider to easily stand up new instance of the engine and its root pico. For this to be viable, we'll use the support for peer DIDs my students built into the engine last year to give owners a peer DID connection to their root pico on their instance of the engine and thus give them control over the root pico and all its decedents.</p>  <p>Support for Solid Pods—at IIW this past October, we had a few sessions on how picos could be linked to <a href="https://solidproject.org//users/get-a-pod">Solid pods</a>. This project will marry a pod to each pico that gets created and link their lifecycles. This, combined with their support for peer DIDs, makes the pico and its data movable between engines, supporting substitutability.</p>  <p>If I thought I had the bandwidth to support a third group, I'd have them work on building dApps and an App Store to run on top of this. Making that work has a few other fun technical challenges. We've done this before. As I said Forever and Fuse were both essentially dApps. <a href="https://manifold.picolabs.io/#/login">Manifold</a>, a re-creation of <a href="https://www.windley.com/liveweb/sqtag/">SquareTag</a> is a large dApp for the Internet of Things that supports dApplets (is that a thing?) for each thing you store in it. What makes it a dApp is that the data is all in picos that could be hosted anywhere...at least in theory. Making that less theoretical is the next big step. Bruce Conrad has some ideas around that he calls the <a href="https://picolab.github.io/PLAN/">Pico Labs Affiliate Network</a>.</p><p>I think the work of supporting dApps and personal control of our data is vitally important. As I wrote in 2014:</p><blockquote><p>On the Net today we face a choice between freedom and captivity, independence and dependence. How we build the Internet of Things has far-reaching consequences for the humans who will use—or be used by—it. Will we push forward, connecting things using forests of silos that are reminiscent the online services of the 1980’s, or will we learn the lessons of the Internet and build a true Internet of Things?</p><p>From <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2014/04/the_compuserve_of_things.shtml">The CompuServe of Things</a><br>Referenced 2023-11-12T17:15:48-0500</p></blockquote><p>The choice is ours. We can build the world we want to live in.</p>

<p>This article shows how to implement authentication in ASP.NET Core using multiple identity providers or secure token servers. When using multiple identity providers, the authentication flows need to be separated per scheme for the sign-in flow and the sign-out flow. The claims are different and would require mapping logic depending on the authorization logic of the application. </p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/MulitipleClientClaimsMapping">https://github.com/damienbod/MulitipleClientClaimsMapping</a></p>



<p></p>



 Setup 



<p>OpenID Connect is used for the authentication and the session is stored in a cookie. A confidential client using OpenID Connect code flow with PKCE is used for both schemes. The client configuration in the secure token servers need to match the ASP.NET Core configuration. The sign-in and the sign-out callback URLs are different for the different token servers. </p>







<p></p>



<p>The AddAuthentication method is used to define the authentication services. Cookies are used to store the session. The “t1” scheme is used to setup the Duende OpenID Connect client and the “t2” scheme is used to setup the OpenIddict scheme. The callback URLs are specified in this setup. </p>



<p></p>


  builder.Services.AddAuthentication(options =&gt;
{
    options.DefaultScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    options.DefaultChallengeScheme = OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
})
.AddCookie()
.AddOpenIdConnect("t1", options =&gt; // Duende IdentityServer 
{
    builder.Configuration.GetSection("IdentityServerSettings").Bind(options);
    options.SignInScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    options.ResponseType = OpenIdConnectResponseType.Code;
    options.SaveTokens = true;
    options.GetClaimsFromUserInfoEndpoint = true;
    options.TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
    {
        NameClaimType = "name"
    };
    options.MapInboundClaims = false;
})
.AddOpenIdConnect("t2", options =&gt; // OpenIddict server 
{
    builder.Configuration.GetSection("IdentityProviderSettings").Bind(options);
    options.SignInScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    options.ResponseType = OpenIdConnectResponseType.Code;
    options.SaveTokens = true;
    options.GetClaimsFromUserInfoEndpoint = true;
    options.TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
    {
        NameClaimType = "name"
    };
});
  


<p></p>



<p>The configurations which are different per environment are read from the configuration object. The source of the data can be the appsettings.json, Azure Key Vault, user secrets or whatever you use.</p>


  "IdentityProviderSettings": { // OpenIddict
	"Authority": "https://localhost:44318",
	"ClientId": "codeflowpkceclient",
	"ClientSecret": "--your-secret-from-keyvault-or-user-secrets--",
	"CallbackPath": "/signin-oidc-t2",
	"SignedOutCallbackPath": "/signout-callback-oidc-t2"
},
"IdentityServerSettings": { // Duende IdentityServer
	"Authority": "https://localhost:44319",
	"ClientId": "oidc-pkce-confidential",
	"ClientSecret": "--your-secret-from-keyvault-or-user-secrets--",
	"CallbackPath": "/signin-oidc-t1",
	"SignedOutCallbackPath": "/signout-callback-oidc-t1"
}
  


<p></p>



 Sign-in 



<p>The application and the user can authenticate using different identity providers. The scheme is setup when starting to authentication flow so that the application knows which secure token server should be used. I added two separate controller endpoints for this. The Challenge request is then sent correctly.</p>


  [HttpGet("LoginOpenIddict")]
public ActionResult LoginOpenIddict(string returnUrl)
{
	return Challenge(new AuthenticationProperties
	{
		RedirectUri = !string.IsNullOrEmpty(returnUrl) ? returnUrl : "/", 
	}, "t2");
}

[HttpGet("LoginIdentityServer")]
public ActionResult LoginIdentityServer(string returnUrl)
{
	return Challenge(new AuthenticationProperties
	{
		RedirectUri = !string.IsNullOrEmpty(returnUrl) ? returnUrl : "/"
	}, "t1");
}
  


<p></p>



<p>The UI part of the application calls the correct endpoint. This is just a HTTP link which sends a GET request.</p>


  &lt;li class="nav-item"&gt;
    &lt;a class="nav-link text-dark" 
       href="~/api/Account/LoginIdentityServer"&gt;Login t1 IdentityServer&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="nav-item"&gt;
    &lt;a class="nav-link text-dark" 
       href="~/api/Account/LoginOpenIddict"&gt;Login t2 OpenIddict&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  


<p></p>



 Sign-out 



<p>The application also needs to sign-out correctly. A sign-out is sent to the secure token server and not only locally in the application. To sign out correctly, the application must use the correct scheme. This can be found using the HttpContext features. Once the scheme is known, the sign-out request can be sent to the correct secure token server.</p>


  [Authorize]
public class LogoutModel : PageModel
{
    public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; OnGetAsync()
    {
        if (User.Identity!.IsAuthenticated)
        {
            var authProperties = HttpContext.Features
               .GetRequiredFeature&lt;IAuthenticateResultFeature&gt;();

            var schemeToLogout = authProperties.AuthenticateResult!.Ticket!
               .Properties.Items[".AuthScheme"];

            if (schemeToLogout != null)
            {
                return SignOut(new AuthenticationProperties
                {
                    RedirectUri = "/SignedOut"
                },
                CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,
                schemeToLogout);
            }
        }

        await HttpContext.SignOutAsync(
          CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme);

        return Redirect("/SignedOut");
    }
}
  


 Notes 



<p>Setting up multiple secure token servers or identity providers for a single ASP.NET Core application is relatively simple using the standard ASP.NET Core endpoints. Once you start using the different identity provider authentication Nuget client packages from the specific libraries, it gets complicated as the client libraries overwrite different default values which breaks the other client flows. Using multiple identity providers, it is probably better to not use the client libraries and stick to the standard OpenID Connect implementation. </p>

<p></p>
<p>Eight years ago, I called ad blocking <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2015/09/28/beyond-ad-blocking-the-biggest-boycott-in-human-history/">The Biggest Boycott in World History</a>, because hundreds of millions of people were blocking ads online. (The headline came from my wife, by the way.) Then, a few days ago, Cory Doctorow kindly <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/11/09/lead-me-not-into-temptation/">pointed to that post</a> in one of his typically trenchant <a href="https://pluralistic.net/">Pluralistic</a> newsletters.</p>
<p>So I thought I’d check to see how the boycott is doing.</p>
<p>It’s hard to find original sources of hard numbers on ad blocking. Instead, there are lots of what I’ll call claims. But some of those claims do cite or link to sources of some kind. Here are four:</p>
 
 <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/berkman-bookclub?pli=1">Brian Dean</a>‘s&nbsp;<a href="https://backlinko.com/ad-blockers-users">Backlinko</a> <a href="https://backlinko.com/ad-blockers-users#ad-blocking-stats">sources</a> <a href="https://www.hootsuite.com/resources/digital-trends">Hootsuite</a>, saying 42.7% of Internet users employ ad blockers. Hootsuite, however, wants me to fill out a form that I am sure will get me spammed. So I’m passing on that. Meanwhile there are other interesting stats cited. <a href="https://blog.cipio.ai/how-many-people-use-ad-blockers">Growson Edwards on Cipio.ai surfaces</a> a bunch of Hootsuite graphics with interesting data. 
 <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/3201/ad-blocking/#topicOverview">Statista last January said</a> “the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/804008/ad-blocking-reach-usage-us/">ad blocking user penetration rate in the United States</a> stood at approximately 26 percent in 2020, indicating that roughly 73 million internet users had installed some form of ad blocking software, plugin, or browser on their web-enabled devices that year. While awareness of these services lies at almost 90 percent, the number of internet users actively leveraging the technology has stagnated in recent years following visible changes in online user behavior. The switch from desktop to mobile has arguably had one of the most significant impacts on ad block usage: As internet users increasingly browse the web via mobile devices,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/594183/pc-users-ad-blocker-usage-usa/">desktop ad block usage rates in the U.S.</a>&nbsp;and many other parts of the world are dropping, albeit at varying speeds. While mobile ad blocking adoption is still at a nascent stage in the U.S., the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/606357/mobile-adblocking-browser-users-worldwide/">global number of mobile ad blocking browser users</a> is rapidly increasing.” <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/804008/ad-blocking-reach-usage-us/">On another page</a>, Statista says marketers “can conquer ad blocking by offering personalized advertising.” Anybody want that? Give me a show of hands. Thought so. 
 <a href="https://blockthrough.com/">Blockthrough</a>, an advertising company, <a href="https://blockthrough.com/blog/2022-pagefair-adblock-report/">offers a 2022 adblock report</a> that requires filling out a form. So I passed on that one too, but can report that its “key insights” are these: “With 290M monthly active users globally, adblocking on desktop has climbed back close to its all-time-high from 2018,” and “The average adblock rate across geos and verticals is 21%, as measured across &gt;10B pageviews on 9,453 websites.” 
 <a href="https://surfshark.com/">Surfshark</a> has <a href="https://surfshark.com/global-ad-blocking">some cool maps</a> showing which countries hate ads most and least, based on searches for ad-blocking software. (France was at the top.) 
 
<p>Perhaps more interesting than any of those stats (all of which are unsurprising) is using AI to generate graphics for a post such as this one. At first, I wanted the system (Bing Creator or whatever it’s called this week) to show two separate populations: one living blissfully in a land without advertising, and one with advertising everywhere. That was a fail. I couldn’t get it not to show advertising on both sides. Then I tried to get it to depict the blocking of ads, for example with a wall. That failed too, because advertising always appeared on the wall. Finally, I got the image above with a prompt asking for people who were happy to have advertising inside a giant bottle. Isn’t it crazy how fast the miraculous becomes annoying?</p>

Photo credit: Brian Campbell from this <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/resources/blog/post/vittorio-bertocci-identity-community-contributions.html">article</a> on the Ping Identity&nbsp;blog<p>Vittorio Bertocci, much like many others in the identity space, had an important impact on my professional life. You can imagine how I felt when, a month following his tragic passing, I saw another <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/our-take-on-verifiable-credentials/">blog post</a> produced by the <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/g-o-a-t/">GOAT</a> of creating understandable technical content about identity. Further, the subject of the post is my deepest area of knowledge: verifiable credential adoption (which was the topic of conversation for almost all my time spent with Vittorio).</p><p>Vittorio’s sage perspective on verifiable credentials is important for the IDtech community to understand. In this post, I want to outline how Vittorio influenced our direction at Trinsic and highlight a few important points from the recent&nbsp;post.</p><p>In 2017 I was a fresh face in the identity industry, pumped full of slogans and claims from the infinitely optimistic self-sovereign identity (SSI) evangelists who I surrounded myself with at the time. Having only seen one perspective, I fully believed that consumers could “own” their identity, that “data breaches would be a thing of the past”, and that verifiable credentials would usher in a new era of privacy maximalism.</p><p>The world needs idealists — but it also needs pragmatists. Vittorio became an archetype of the pragmatic energy that eventually worked its way into the culture and products at the company I cofounded in 2019, <a href="https://trinsic.id/">Trinsic</a>. His directed questions and healthy skepticism of marvelous SSI claims came not from a Luddite spirit, but from deep experience. In a <a href="https://www.cloudidentity.com/blog/2022/01/11/remembering-kim-cameron/">blog post</a> about his involvement in the CardSpace project at Microsoft, he said, “When the user centric identity effort substantially failed to gain traction in actual products, with the identity industry incorporating some important innovations (hello, claims) but generally rejecting many of the key tenets I held so dear, something broke inside me. I became disillusioned with pure principled views, and moved toward a stricter Job to be done, user cases driven&nbsp;stance.”</p><p>For the last four years as a reusable identity infrastructure company, our developer tools for integrating verifiable credentials, identity wallets, and policy/governance tools have become quite popular. Thousands of developers have created dozens of applications that have acquired hundreds of thousands of end-users and issued close to a million credentials in production. This experience has given us a unique vantage point on patterns and methods for successfully deploying verifiable credentials in production. We’ve also spoken to many of these customers and other partners on our <a href="https://trinsic.id/podcast">podcast</a> and in private to understand these patterns more&nbsp;deeply.</p><p>I state all of this so that I can say the following with some credibility: Vitorrio’s perspectives (and by extension Auth0’s) are a must-read for anyone working on user-centric identity. I’ll double click on a few of what I view to be the most important points&nbsp;below.</p><blockquote>What do we need to do to make a classic OpenID Connect flow behave more like the drivers license for buying wine scenario in offline&nbsp;life?</blockquote><blockquote>The two main discrepancies we identified were: Ability to use the token with multiple RPs and Ability to transact with an RP without IdP knowing anything about time and parties involved in the transaction</blockquote><p>The first point I want to highlight is that Vittorio introduces verifiable credentials (VCs) by relating them to something his audience is familiar with — OIDC. This is not only a helpful practice for pitching products in general, but it embeds an important point for IDtech people: VCs are not a fundamental transformation of identity. VCs are an incremental improvement on previous generations of identity technology. (But one that I believe can enable exponentially better product experiences when done&nbsp;right.)</p><p>VCs will be adopted when they are applied to use cases that existing solutions fail to accommodate. It’s key for VC-powered products to demonstrate how VCs enable a problem to be solved in a new way — otherwise, buyers will opt for the safer federated solutions over&nbsp;VCs.</p><p>A classic example to illustrate my point is “passwordless login”. I’ve been hearing about it for 6 years, and yet never actually seen verifiable credentials be adopted for passwordless authentication. I believe the reason for this is that the two points above (ability to use the token with multiple RPs, IdP not knowing about the transaction) aren’t important enough for this use case, and that other, lighter-weight solutions can do it&nbsp;better.</p><blockquote>We might say that there are too many cooks in the kitchen… I dare say this space is overspecified… A lot of work will need to happen in the marketplace, as production implementations with working use cases feel the pain points from these specs and run into a few walls for some of VCs to fully come to&nbsp;life.</blockquote><p>Vittorio taught me about the history of OAuth, OpenID, OAuth2, and OpenID Connect. I learned about early, nonstandard iterations of “login with” buttons that had millions of active users. I learned about the market forces that led these divergent applications to eventually standardize.</p><p>Standardization is essential for adoption. But adoption is essential for knowing what to standardize (there’s nothing worse than standardizing the wrong thing)! Prematurely standardizing before adoption is a classic “cart before the horse” scenario. My conversations with Vittorio led me to write <a href="https://medium.com/trinsic/the-catch-22-of-interoperability-fea4dc5ef582">this catch-22 of interoperability post</a>.</p><p>IDtech builders need to focus on building a good, adoptable product first. Then make it interoperable/compatible with other products second. This is a key design principle baked into Trinsic’s platform (e.g. whatever you build will inherit interoperability when it’s needed, but you won’t waste time figuring it out in the meantime).</p><blockquote>[A misconception:] Centralized DBs will disappear… and in turn this would prevent some of the massive data leaks that we have seen in <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/PwnedWebsites">recent history</a>. It’s unclear how that would&nbsp;work.</blockquote><p>Vittorio correctly identified this as a misconception. Centralized databases indeed won’t disappear anytime soon. The notion that companies “won’t need to hold my data”, if it ever happens, will be far in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>The near-term disruption that will happen, however, is something I pointed out in a <a href="https://x.com/rileyphughes/status/1663745376372023298?s=20">conversation</a> with Vittorio that started on Twitter and moved offline. Service providers who don’t originate data themselves, but aggregate or intermediate between parties in a transaction, are at risk of disruption from verifiable credentials.</p><p>The example I use in the post linked above is <a href="https://theworknumber.com/">Work Number</a>. Employers give Work Number information about their employees to avoid fielding background screening calls. If employers gave that information directly to employees in a verifiable credential, however, Work Number’s role would need to change dramatically. Because of this threat, identity verification, student attestations, background screening, and other of these kinds of companies are among the first to adopt verifiable credentials.</p><blockquote>Unless users decide to not present more data than necessary for particular operations, it is possible that they will end up disclosing more/all credential data just for usability sake.</blockquote><p>This dynamic is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox">Jevons paradox</a> applied to identity — VCs counterintuitively risk creating worse privacy conditions, even with things like data minimization, because of the frequency of use. Nobody has a crystal ball, so it’s impossible to know whether this risk will materialize. Governance is the best tool at our disposal to reduce this risk and enable better privacy for people. I talk about this a fair bit in <a href="https://ssimeetup.org/ssi-adoption-what-will-it-take-riley-hughes-webinar-67/">this webinar</a> and plan to write a blog post about it in the&nbsp;future.</p><blockquote>Users will typically already have credentials in their wallets and verifiers will simply need to verify them, in a (mostly) stateless fashion… However, we do have a multi-parties cold start problem. To have viable VCs we need effective, dependable and ubiquitous wallets. To have good wallets, we need relying parties implementing flows that require them, and creating real, concrete requirements for actual use. To incentivize RPs to implement and explore new flows, we need high value, ubiquitous credentials that make good business sense to leverage. But to get natural IdPs to create the infrastructure to issue such credentials, you need all of the above… plus a business&nbsp;case.</blockquote><p>The chicken-and-egg problem (or, “cold start” problem) is a trick for almost all IDtech products. While there will always be exceptions to the rule, I have seen enough failure and success to feel confident in a somewhat concrete recipe for overcoming this obstacle.</p>  Remove the wallet as a dependency. If a user needs to be redirected to an app store, download an app, step through onboarding steps, see an empty app, go scan QR codes to get credentials, all before it can actually be used… it’s extremely unlikely to be adopted. Instead, give users invisible “wallets” for their credentials. This is the #1 unlock that led to several of Trinsic’s customers scaling to hundreds of thousands of&nbsp;users.  If your entity can play the role of issuer (or IdP) then you’re in a great position. If you’re not, obtain your own data so that you can be. Dig in with one or more companies and partner closely to build something very specific first with existing&nbsp;data.  Sell to use cases that aren’t well-served by existing OIDC or similar technologies. Expand the markets you’re selling to by going into the long tail. Focus on either low-frequency, high-value use cases or high-frequency, low-value applications. Make it easy to integrate.  <p>Shamefully, it took me 5 years of pattern matching to land at the conclusions that Vittorio and others saw much sooner. These are the same points that led to adoption of OAuth/OIDC. And frankly, when you look at it, are pretty&nbsp;obvious.</p><blockquote>The main one is being able to disclose our identity/claims without issuers knowing. It is a civil liberty; it is a right. As more of our life moves online, we should be able to express our identity like we do it&nbsp;offline.</blockquote><p>Privacy is an important point. This requirement, in particular, is a requirement for most governments to be involved. It’s also a biggie for any sensitive/”vice” industry (gambling, adult content, controlled substances, etc.) which historically is a driver of new technology due to having broad appeal and high frequency.</p><blockquote>Once [the adoption flywheel] happens, it will likely happen all of a sudden… which is why it is really a good idea to stay up-to-date and experiment with VCs&nbsp;TODAY</blockquote><p>This “slow… then all at once” dynamic is a critical insight, and very true. We’ve seen this over the last year in the identity verification segment. My first conversations with identity verification companies were at Sovrin in 2018. Despite consistently following along, there was no movement from anybody for years. Suddenly, after <a href="https://onfido.com/press-release/onfido-acquires-airside/">Onfido acquired Airside</a> in May, <a href="https://plaid.com/blog/one-click-verification-plaid-idv/">Plaid</a>, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/persona-introduces-industry-first-reusable-identity-solution-with-dynamic-risk-signals-301964490.html">Persona</a>, <a href="https://www.axios.com/pro/fintech-deals/2023/10/05/clear-acquires-sora-id">ClearMe</a>, <a href="https://www.instnt.org/ourpress/instnt-launches-multipass">Instnt</a>, <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/au10tix-id-document-biometric-verification-platform-and-reusable-id-solution-now-available-in-the-microsoft-azure-marketplace-1032758864?op=1">Au10tix</a>, and more have jumped into the fray with their own “Reusable ID” solutions.</p><p>Auth0 posits that governments will be the critical unlock for verifiable credentials. While I don’t think that’s wrong, we are seeing increased bottoms-up adoption from the private sector, both from <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/10/19/idtech-is-the-new-fintech/?sh=78c115cb3a88">IDtech</a> companies and verification providers of all kinds. Governments will play an important role, ideally anchoring wallets with high-assurance legal identity credentials and leading with standards that will produce to interoperable solutions.</p><p>If you haven’t already, I encourage you to read the whole <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/our-take-on-verifiable-credentials/">post</a>. I’m grateful for the Auth0 team for shipping the post after Vittorio’s passing, so the world can benefit from his knowledge.

<p>OpenID Federation draft 31 has been published at <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-1_0-31.html">https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-1_0-31.html</a> and <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-1_0.html">https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-1_0.html</a>.  It’s the result of concerted efforts to make the specification straightforward to read, understand, and implement for developers.  Many sections have been rewritten and simplified.  Some content has been reorganized to make its structure and relationships more approachable.  Many inconsistencies were addressed.</p>
<p>Some inconsistencies fixed resulted in a small number of breaking changes.  For instance, the name “<code>trust_mark_owners</code>” is now consistently used throughout, whereas an alternate spelling was formerly also used.  The editors tried to make all known such changes in this version, so hopefully this will be the last set of breaking changes.  We published draft 31 now in part to get these changes out to implementers.  See the history entries at <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-1_0-31.html#name-document-history">https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-1_0-31.html#name-document-history</a> for a detailed description of the changes made.</p>
<p>A comprehensive review of the specification is still ongoing.  Expect more improvements in the exposition in draft 32.  With any luck, -32 will be the basis of the next proposed Implementer’s Draft.</p>
<p>We’re definitely grateful for all the useful feedback we’re receiving from developers.  Developer feedback is gold!</p>

Asking an LLM to write code, and having it magically appear? That’s an obvious life-changer. Talking with an LLM about the code you’re partnering with it to write? I think that’s a less obvious but equally profound life-changer.

<p>This article shows how to use a strong nonce based CSP with Angular for scripts and styles. When using a nonce, the overall security can be increased and it is harder to do XSS attacks or other type of attacks in the web UI. A separate solution is required for development and production deployments.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/bff-aspnetcore-angular">https://github.com/damienbod/bff-aspnetcore-angular</a></p>



<p>When using Angular, the root of the UI usually starts from a HTML file. A meta tag with the CSP_NONCE placeholder was added as well as the ngCspNonce from Angular. The meta tag is used to add the nonce to the Angular provider or development npm packages. The ngCspNonce  is used for Angular, although this does not work without adding the nonce to the Angular provider.</p>


  &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8" /&gt;
    &lt;meta name="CSP_NONCE" content="**PLACEHOLDER_NONCE_SERVER**" /&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;ui&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;base href="/" /&gt;
    &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" /&gt;
    &lt;link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="favicon.ico" /&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;app-root ngCspNonce="**PLACEHOLDER_NONCE_SERVER**"&gt;&lt;/app-root&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
  


<p>The CSP_NONCE is added to the Angular providers. This is required, otherwise the nonce is not added to the Angular generated scripts. The nonce value is read from the meta tag header.</p>


  import { provideHttpClient, withInterceptors } from '@angular/common/http';
import { ApplicationConfig, CSP_NONCE } from '@angular/core';
import { secureApiInterceptor } from './secure-api.interceptor';

import {
  provideRouter,
  withEnabledBlockingInitialNavigation,
} from '@angular/router';
import { appRoutes } from './app.routes';

const nonce = (
  document.querySelector('meta[name="CSP_NONCE"]') as HTMLMetaElement
)?.content;

export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
  providers: [
    provideRouter(appRoutes, withEnabledBlockingInitialNavigation()),
    provideHttpClient(withInterceptors([secureApiInterceptor])),
    {
      provide: CSP_NONCE,
      useValue: nonce,
    },
  ],
};
  


 CSP in HTTP responses production 



<p>The UI now uses the nonce based CSP. The server can return all responses forcing this and increasing the security of the web application. It is important to use a nonce and not the self attribute as this overrides the nonce. You do not want to use self as this allows jsonp scripts. The unsafe-inline is used for backward compatibility. This is a good setup for production.</p>


  style-src 'unsafe-inline' 'nonce-your-random-nonce-string'; script-src 'unsafe-inline' 'nonce-your-random-nonce-string';
  


 CSP style in development 



<p>Unfortunately, it is not possible to apply the style nonce in development due to the Angular setup. I used self in development for styles. This works, but has problems as you only discover style errors after a deployment, not during feature development. The later you discover errors, the more expensive it is to fix it.</p>



 Replace the values in the index.html 



<p>Now that the Angular application can use the nonce correctly, it needs to be updated with every page refresh or GET. The nonce is generated in the server part of the web application and is added to the index html file on each response. It is applied to all scripts and styles.</p>

Clive is focusing on how the cassette tape unlocked creativity, but in doing so he describes its properties in a way that is helpful to discussions about online relationships in general.</p><p>Clive doesn't speak about cassette tapes being decentralized. In fact, I chuckle as I write that down. Instead he's focused on some core properties. Two I found the most interesting were that cassette tapes allowed one-to-one exchange of music and that they were permissionless. He says:</p><blockquote><p>If you wanted to record a cassette, you didn’t need anyone’s permission.</p><p>This was a quietly radical thing, back when cassette recorders first emerged. Many other forms of audio or moving-image media required a lot of capital infrastructure: If you wanted to broadcast a TV show, you needed a studio and broadcasting equipment; the same goes for a radio show or film, or producing and distributing an album. And your audience needed an entirely different set of technologies (televisions, radios, projectors, record players) to receive your messages.</p><p>From <a href="https://clivethompson.medium.com/the-empowering-style-of-cassette-tapes-e3a620590d42">The Empowering Style of Cassette Tapes</a><br>Referenced 2023-11-02T08:01:46-0400</p></blockquote><p>The thing that struck me on reading this was the idea that symmetric technology democratizes speech. The web is based on assymetric technology: client-server. In theory everyone can have a server, but they don't for a lot of reasons including cost, difficulty, and friction. Consequently, the web is dominated by a few large players who act as <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/authentic_digital_relationships.shtml#anemic">intervening administrative authorities</a>. They decide what happens online and who can participate. The web is not one-to-one and it is decidedly not permissionless.</p><p>In contrast, the DIDComm protocol is symmetric and so it <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/11/didcomm_and_the_self-sovereign_internet.shtml">fosters one-to-one interactions</a> that provide <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/11/operationalizing_digital_relationships.shtml">meaningful, life-like online relationships</a>.

Like the cassette tape, DIDComm is a democratizing technology.</p>   <p>Photo Credit: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/andreanna/4320423382">Mix Tape</a> from Andreanna Moya Photography (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/">CC BY-NC-ND 2.0 DEED</a>)</p>   <p>Thanks for reading Phil Windley's Technometria!

<p>The new “<a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-rha-jose-hpke-encrypt-01.html">Use of Hybrid Public-Key Encryption (HPKE) with Javascript Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE)</a>” specification has been published.  Its abstract is:</p>
<blockquote><p>
This specification defines Hybrid public-key encryption (HPKE) for use with Javascript Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE). HPKE offers a variant of public-key encryption of arbitrary-sized plaintexts for a recipient public key.</p>
<p>HPKE works for any combination of an asymmetric key encapsulation mechanism (KEM), key derivation function (KDF), and authenticated encryption with additional data (AEAD) function. Authentication for HPKE in JOSE is provided by JOSE-native security mechanisms or by one of the authenticated variants of HPKE.</p>
<p>This document defines the use of the HPKE with JOSE.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hybrid Public Key Encryption (HPKE) is defined by <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9180.html">RFC 9180</a>.  There’s a whole new generation of specifications using it for encryption.  The Messaging Layer Security (MLS) Protocol [<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9420.html">RFC 9420</a>] uses it.  <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-tls-esni-17.html">TLS Encrypted Client Hello</a> uses it.  <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-cose-hpke-07.html">Use of Hybrid Public-Key Encryption (HPKE) with CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE)</a> brings it to COSE.  And this specification brings it to JOSE.</p>
<p>One of our goals for the JOSE HPKE specification is to keep it closely aligned with the COSE HPKE specification.  That should be facilitated by having multiple authors in common, with Hannes Tschofenig and Orie Steele being authors of both, and me being a COSE co-chair.</p>
<p>Aritra Banerjee will be presenting the draft to the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/jose/about/">JOSE working group</a> at <a href="https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/118/">IETF 118 in Prague</a>.  I’m hoping to see many of you there!</p>

   It has been a year since I have blogged about my IndieAuth server Irwin.  Prior to that, in Minimum Viable IndieAuth Server, I explained my motivation for starting the project.  In the same spirit, I would like an activitypub server as simple to understand as possible.

  <p>It <a href="https://herestomwiththeweather.com/2022/10/25/indieauth-login-history/">has been a year</a> since I have blogged about my IndieAuth server <a href="https://github.com/herestomwiththeweather/irwin">Irwin</a>.  Prior to that, in <a href="https://herestomwiththeweather.com/2022/10/09/minimum-viable-indieauth-server/">Minimum Viable IndieAuth Server</a>, I explained my motivation for starting the project.  In the same spirit, I would like an activitypub server as simple to understand as possible.  I thought it might be interesting to add the activitypub and webfinger support to an IndieAuth server so I have created an experimental branch <a href="https://github.com/herestomwiththeweather/irwin/tree/ap_wip">ap_wip</a>.  An important part of this development has been writing specs.  For example, <a href="https://github.com/herestomwiththeweather/irwin/blob/ap_wip/spec/requests/accounts_spec.rb#L23">here are my specs</a> for handling the “<a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/spec/activitypub/#Move">Move</a>” command, an important Mastodon feature.</p>

<p>I still have about half a dozen items to do before I consider dogfooding this branch but hopefully I can do that soon.</p>

<p>The initial <a href="https://openid.net/connect">OpenID Connect</a> specifications became final on February 25, 2014.  While the working group is rightfully proud of the quality of the work and the widespread adoption it has attained, specification writing is a human endeavor and mistakes will inevitably be made.  That’s why the OpenID Foundation has a process for publishing Errata corrections to specifications.</p>
<p>Eight issues were identified and corrected that year, with the first set of errata corrections being published on November 8, 2014.  Since that time, suggestions for improvements have continued to trickle in, but with a 9+ year trickle, a total of 95 errata issues have been filed!  They range from the nearly trivial, such as an instance of <code>http</code> that should have been <code>https</code>, to the more consequential, such as language that could be interpreted in different ways.</p>
<p>I’m pleased to report that, with a substantial investment by <a href="https://openid.net/wg/connect/">the working group</a>, I’ve managed to work through all the 87 additional errata issues filed since the first errata set and incorporate corrections for them into published specification drafts.  They are currently undergoing <a href="https://openid.net/review-second-proposed-errata-openid-connect-specifications/">OpenID Foundation-wide review</a> in preparation for a vote to approve the second set of errata corrections.</p>
<p>As a bonus, the OpenID Foundation plans to submit the newly minted corrected drafts for publication by ISO as <a href="https://www.iso.org/deliverables-all.html#PAS">Publicly Available Specifications</a>.  This should foster even broader adoption of OpenID Connect by enabling deployments in some jurisdictions around the world that have legal requirements to use specifications from standards bodies recognized by international treaties, of which ISO is one.  Just in time for OpenID Connect’s <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=2448">10th anniversary</a>!</p>

<p>I’m pleased to bring your attention to the upcoming <a href="https://www.openid.or.jp/summit/2024/en/">OpenID Summit Tokyo 2024</a>, which will be held on Friday, January 19, 2024.  Join us there for a stellar line-up of speakers and consequential conversations!</p>
<p></p>
<p>This builds on the successes of past summits organized by the <a href="https://www.openid.or.jp/">OpenID Foundation Japan</a>.  For instance, I found the <a href="https://www.openid.or.jp/summit/2020/en/">OpenID Summit Tokyo 2020</a> and associated activities and discussions both very useful and very enjoyable.</p>
<p>A special feature of the 2024 summit will be celebrating the 10th anniversary of the <a href="https://openid.net/connect">OpenID Connect</a> specifications, which were approved on February 25, 2014.  Speakers who were there for its creation, interop testing, and early deployments will share their experiences and lessons learned, including several key participants from Japan.  As I recounted at EIC 2023, <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=2345">building ecosystems is hard</a>.  And yet we achieved that for OpenID Connect!  We are working to create new identity ecosystems as we speak.  I believe that the lessons learned from OpenID Connect are very applicable today.  Come join the conversation!</p>
<p>Finally, as a teaser, I’m also helping the OpenID Foundation to plan two additional 10th anniversary celebrations at prominent 2024 identity events – one in Europe and one in the Americas.  Watch this space for further news about these as it develops!</p>

Like the term <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2023/10/zero_data.shtml">zero data</a><a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2023/10/zero_data.shtml"> that I wrote about a few weeks ago</a>, cloudless computing is a great name that captures an idea that is profound.</p><p>Cloudless computing uses cryptographic identifiers, verifiable data, and location-independent compute1 to move apps to the data wherever it lives, to perform whatever computation needs to be done, at the edge. The genius of of the name cloudless computing is that it gets us out of the trenches of dapps, web3, blockchain, and other specific implementations and speaks to an idea or concept. The abstractions can make it difficult get a firm hold on the ideas, but it's important to getting past the how so we can speak to the what and why.</p><p>You be rightly skeptical that any of this can happen. Why will companies move from the proven cloud model to something else? In this talk, Peter Levine talks specifically to that question.</p>    <p>One of the core arguments for why more and more computing will move to the edge is the sheer size of modern computing problems. Consider one example: Tesla Full Self Driving (FSD). I happen to be a Tesla owner and I bought FSD. At first it was just because I am very curious about it and couldn't stand to not have first-hand experience with it. But now, I like it so much I use it all the time and can't imagine driving without an AI assist. But that's beside the point. To understand why that drives computing to the edge, consider that the round trip time to get an answer from the cloud is just too great. The car needs to make decisions onboard for this to work. Essentially, to put this in the cloudless perspective, the computation has to move to where the data from the sensors is. You move the compute to the data, not the other way around.2</p><p>And that's just one example. Levine makes the point, as <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2013/05/imagining_trillion_node_networks.shtml">I and others</a> have done, that the Internet of Things leads to trillions of nodes on the Internet. This is a difference in scale that has real impact on how we architect computer systems. While today's <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/07/alternatives_to_the_compuserve_of_things.shtml">CompuServe of Things</a> still relies largely on the cloud and centralized servers, that model can't last in a true Internet of Things.</p><p>The future world will be more decentralized than the current one. Not because of some grand ideal (although <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/authentic_digital_relationships.shtml#self-sovereign">those certainly exist</a>) but simply because the problems will force it to happen. We're using computers in more dynamic environments than the more static ones (like web applications) of the past. The data is too large to move and the required latency too low. Cloudless computing is the future.</p>    Notes   <p>Anderson calls this deterministic computer. He uses that name to describe computation that is consistent and predictable regardless of how the application gets to the data, but I'm not sure that's the core idea. Location independence feels better to me.</p>  <p>An interesting point is that training the AI that drives the car is still done in the cloud somewhere. But once the model is built, it operates close to the data. I think this will be true for a lot of AI models.</p>  <p>Photo Credit: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/santafeegret/3279695354">Cloudless Sunset</a> from Dorothy Finley (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC BY 2.0 DEED</a> - cropped)</p>   <p>Thanks for reading Phil Windley's Technometria!

  <p>Crisis situation are characterised by being urgent, complicated, nuanced, ambiguous and messy. The easy part is acknowledging that crisis presents exceptional and unprecedented challenges for organisations and leadership teams. In such periods, the stakes appear higher, and the decisions made can have far-reaching consequences.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The question of whether a leadership team should think, act and behave differently during times of war, conflict, and crisis is undoubtedly open for debate. But what did the last global pandemic (crisis) teach us, and what lessons learned have we forgotten in the light of new wars?&nbsp;</p>   <p><br></p><p>Pre-pandemic leadership framing about how to deal with a crisis.</p> The vast majority of how to deal with a crisis pre-pandemic was based on coaching, training and mentoring but lacked real experience of the realities because global crises do not happen at scale very often. Whilst essential to prepare, thankfully most directors never get to work in a crisis and learn. Pre-COVID, the structured and passed down wisdom focussed on developing the following skills.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>Be Adaptable: In times of crisis, including war and conflict, the operating environment becomes highly volatile and uncertain. A leadership team must become more adaptable and flexible to respond to rapidly changing circumstances. Directors are trained to be more willing to recognise and pivot their strategies and make quick decisions, unlike stable times, where longer-term planning is often feasible.</p><p>Unity and Cohesion: A leadership team should act cohesively during a crisis and drop the niggles and power plays. Clear communication and collaboration among executives and directors are essential to ensure everyone is aligned and working towards a common goal. Unity is critical in times of uncertainty to maintain the organisation's stability and morale.</p><p>Decisiveness: Crisis demands decisiveness, with fewer facts and more noise, from its leaders. In the face of adversity, a leadership team should be ready to make tough choices promptly which will be very different to normal day-to-day thinking. Hesitation can be costly, and the consequences of indecision are amplified and become more severe during a crisis.&nbsp;</p><p>Resource Allocation: A crisis will strain resources, making efficient and effective allocation idealistic and not practical. A leadership team should reevaluate its resource allocation, prioritising the needs based on the best opinion today, which will mean compromise and sacrifice.&nbsp; It is about doing your best, as it will never be the most efficient, effective or right.&nbsp;</p><p>Risk Management: In times of crisis, certain risks are heightened. A leadership team must adjust its risk management strategy, potentially being more conservative and prudent to safeguard the people and the organisation's long-term viability.</p> This is a lovely twee list, they are obvious, highly relevant and important, but the reality is totally different. Leaders and directors quickly move past these ideals to the reality of crisis management.&nbsp;  The day-to-day stress and grind of crisis surface the unsaid, hostile and uncomfortable - all aspects we learned in COVID and include. <br><p>Consistency: Maintaining a level of consistency across the leadership’s behaviour, regardless of the personal view and external circumstances. Drastic changes in leadership style create additional confusion and anxiety, creating an additional dimension to the existing crisis.</p><p>Ethical Compass: The moral and ethical compass of a leadership team should not waver in times of crisis. Principles such as honesty, integrity, acceptance, and respect (for all views and opinions that are legal) should be upheld, as compromising on ethics can lead to long-term damage to the individual and organisation's reputation.&nbsp; Different opinions matter, as does the importance of ensuring they are aired and discussed openly, however hard and uncomfortable.&nbsp; We might not agree because of our own framing, but that does not mean we actually know what is true or false.&nbsp;</p><p>Strategic Focus: While adaptability is important, a leadership team should not lose sight of its agreed long-term strategic vision. Abrupt changes can disrupt the organisation's core mission and values. Strategies may need to be tweaked, but the overarching values and vision should remain consistent, even in the face of uncertainty.&nbsp; If it does not - then there is a massively different issue you are facing.</p><p>Transparency: Honesty and transparency are essential, particularly during times of crisis. A leadership team should communicate openly with themselves, employees and stakeholders, providing them with a clear understanding of the challenges and the strategies being employed to overcome them.&nbsp; Those prioritising themselves over the cause and survival need to be cut free.&nbsp;</p><p>Legal and Regulatory Compliance: A leadership team should not compromise on legal and regulatory compliance, however much there is a push to the boundaries. Violating laws or regulations can lead to severe consequences that may outweigh any short-term benefits. Many will not like operating in grey areas, which might mean releasing of the leadership team.</p><p>Crisis on Crisis: because we don't know what is going on in someone else's head, heart or home, individuals can quickly run into burnout.&nbsp; We don’t know who has a sick child, a family member has cancer, lost a loved one or is just in a moment of doubt.&nbsp; Each leadership team should assume that everyone in their team needs help and support constantly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br> What have we already forgotten? <p>Post-pandemic leadership quickly forgot about burnout, ethics, transparency and single-mindedness to revert to power plays, incentives and individualism.&nbsp; It was easy to return to where we are most comfortable, and most experiences exist - stability and no global crisis.&nbsp; Interest rates and debt access are hard but are not a crisis unless your model is shot. &nbsp; The congratulatory thinking focussed on we survived the global crisis, it was a blip that is unlikely to be repeated.&nbsp;</p><p>The unique challenges and pressures of war demand adaptability, unity, decisiveness, and resource allocation adjustments - essential skills.&nbsp; However, we have learned that this focus should not come at the expense of consistency, ethical integrity, strategic focus, transparency, and legal compliance. A leadership team's ability to strike this balance can determine the organisation's survival and success during the most trying times. Ultimately, leadership must adapt while maintaining its core values and principles to navigate the turbulent waters of wartime effectively.</p><p>Whether a leadership team should act differently in times of war is a matter of balance, but the lessons and skills we have need to be front and centre.&nbsp; Today, focus on the team and spend more time than ever checking in on your team, staff, suppliers and those in the wider ecosystem.&nbsp; Crisis and conflict destroys life and lives at many levels.</p> <br>

<p>This article looks at implementing an ASP.NET Core application hosting an Angular nx application which authenticates using Microsoft Entra External ID for customers (CIAM). The ASP.NET Core authentication is implemented using the Microsoft.Identity.Web Nuget package. The client implements the OpenID Connect code flow with PKCE and is a confidential client.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/bff-MicrosoftEntraExternalID-aspnetcore-angular">https://github.com/damienbod/bff-MicrosoftEntraExternalID-aspnetcore-angular</a></p>



<p>Microsoft Entra External ID for customers (CIAM) is a new Microsoft product for customer (B2C) identity solutions. This has many changes to the existing Azure AD B2C solution and adopts many of the features from Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD). At present, the product is in public preview.</p>



 App registration setup 



<p>As with any Microsoft Entra ID, Azure AD B2C, Microsoft Entra External ID CIAM application, an Azure App registration is created and used to define the authentication client. The ASP.NET core application is a confidential client and must use a secret or a certificate to authenticate the application as well as the user.</p>



<p>The client authenticates using an OpenID Connect (OIDC) confidential code flow with PKCE. The implicit flow does not need to be activated.</p>



 
<a href="https://damienbod.files.wordpress.com/2023/05/azure_ciam_web_01.png"></a>
 



 User flow setup 



<p>In Microsoft Entra External ID for customers (CIAM), the application must be connected to the user flow. In external identities, a new user flow can be created and the application (The Azure app registration) can be added to the user flow. The user flow can be used to define the specific customer authentication requirements.</p>



 
<a href="https://damienbod.files.wordpress.com/2023/05/azure_ciam_web_02.png"></a>
 



 Architecture Setup 



<p>The application is setup to authenticate as one and remove the sensitive data from the client browser. The single security context has UI logic implemented in Angular and server logic, including the security flows, implemented in ASP.NET Core. The server part of the application handles all requests from the client application and the client application should only use the APIs from the same ASP.NET Core implemented host. Cookies are used to send the secure API requests. The UI implementation is greatly simplified and the backend application can add additional security features as it is a confidential client, or trusted client.</p>



 
<a href="https://damienbod.files.wordpress.com/2023/09/bff-arch-production_01.png"></a>
 



<p></p>



 ASP.NET Core Setup 



<p>The ASP.NET Core application is implemented using the&nbsp;Microsoft.Identity.Web&nbsp;Nuget package. The recommended flow for trusted applications is the OpenID Connect confidential code flow with PKCE. This is setup using the&nbsp;AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApp&nbsp;method and also the&nbsp;EnableTokenAcquisitionToCallDownstreamApi&nbsp;method. The CIAM client configuration is read using the json&nbsp;EntraExternalID&nbsp;section.</p>


  services.AddScoped&lt;MsGraphService&gt;();
services.AddScoped&lt;CaeClaimsChallengeService&gt;();

services.AddAntiforgery(options =&gt;
{
    options.HeaderName = "X-XSRF-TOKEN";
    options.Cookie.Name = "__Host-X-XSRF-TOKEN";
    options.Cookie.SameSite = SameSiteMode.Strict;
    options.Cookie.SecurePolicy = CookieSecurePolicy.Always;
});

services.AddHttpClient();
services.AddOptions();

var scopes = configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("DownstreamApi:Scopes");
string[] initialScopes = scopes!.Split(' ');

services.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebAppAuthentication(configuration, "MicrosoftEntraExternalID")
    .EnableTokenAcquisitionToCallDownstreamApi(initialScopes)
    .AddMicrosoftGraph("https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0", initialScopes)
    .AddInMemoryTokenCaches();
  


<p></p>



<p>In the&nbsp;appsettings.json, user secrets or the production setup, the client specific configurations are defined. The settings must match the Azure App registration. The SignUpSignInPolicyId is no longer used compared to Azure AD B2C. This is linked in the user flow.</p>


    "MicrosoftEntraExternalID": {
    "Authority": "https://damienbodciam.ciamlogin.com/",
    "ClientId": "0990af2f-c338-484d-b23d-dfef6c65f522",
    "CallbackPath": "/signin-oidc",
    "SignedOutCallbackPath ": "/signout-callback-oidc"
    // "ClientSecret": "--in-user-secrets--"
  },
  


<p></p>



 Angular Setup 



<p>The Angular solution for development and production is setup like described in this blog:</p>



 
<blockquote><a href="https://damienbod.com/2023/09/11/implement-a-secure-web-application-using-nx-standalone-angular-and-an-asp-net-core-server/">Implement a secure web application using nx Standalone Angular and an ASP.NET Core&nbsp;server</a></blockquote>
 



<p></p>



<p>The UI part of the application implements no OpenID connect flows and is always part of the server application. The UI can only access APIs from the single hosting application. </p>



 Notes 



<p>I always try to implement user flows for B2C solutions and avoid custom setups as these setups are hard to maintain, expensive to keep updated and hard to migrate when the product is end of life.</p>



<p>Setting up a CIAM client in ASP.NET Core works without problems. CIAM offers many more features but is still missing some essential ones. This product is starting to look really good and will be a great improvement on Azure AD B2C when it is feature complete.</p>



<p>Strong authentication is missing from Microsoft Entra External ID for customers (CIAM) and this makes it hard to test using my Azure AD users. Hopefully FIDO2 and passkeys will get supported soon. See the following link for the supported authentication methods:</p>



<p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/external-identities/customers/concept-supported-features-customers">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/external-identities/customers/concept-supported-features-customers</a></p>



<p>I also require a standard OpenID Connect identity provider (Code flow confidential client with PKCE support) in most of my customer solution rollouts. This is not is supported at present.</p>



<p>With CIAM, new possibilities are also possible for creating single solutions to support both B2B and B2C use cases. Support for Azure security groups and Azure roles in Microsoft Entra External ID for customers (CIAM) is one of the features which makes this possible.</p>

<p>After a lot of discussion on the mailing list over the last few months, and after some excellent discussions at the OAuth Security Workshop, we've been working on revising the draft to provide clearer guidance and clearer discussion of the threats and consequences of the various architectural patterns in the draft.</p>

<p>I would like to give a huge thanks to&nbsp;<a href="https://pragmaticwebsecurity.com/about.html">Philippe De Ryck</a> for stepping up to work on this draft as a co-author!</p>

<p>This version is a huge restructuring of the draft and now starts with a concrete description of possible threats of malicious JavaScript as well as the consequences of each. The architectural patterns have been updated to reference which of each threat is mitigated by the pattern. This restructuring should help readers make a better informed decision by being able to evaluate the risks and benefits of each solution.</p>

In closing circle someone said (paraphrashing) that authentication is solved and the next frontier is authorization. I tend to agree.

Not surprisingly, most of the attendees were from the US (212), followed by Canada (29). Japan, the UK, and Germany rounded out the top five with 9, 8, and 8 attendees respectively. Attendees from India (5), Thailand (3), and Korea (3) showed IIW’s diversity with attendees from APAC. And there were 4 attendees from South America this time. Sadly, there were no attendees from Africa again. Please remember we offer scholarships for people from underrepresented areas, so if you’d like to come to IIW38, please let us know. If you’re working on identity, we want you there.</p><p>In terms of states and provinces, California was, unsurprisingly, first with 81. Washington (32), British Columbia (14), Utah (11), Ontario (11) and New York (10) rounded out the top five. Seattle (22), San Jose (15), Victoria (8), New York (8), and Mountain View (6) were the top cities.</p><p>As always the week was great. I had a dozen important, interesting, and timely conversations. If Closing Circle and Open Gifting are any measure, I was not alone. IIW is where you will meet people help you solve problems and move your ideas forward. Please come! IIW 38 will be held April 16-18, 2024 at the Computer History Museum. We'll have tickets available soon.</p>   <p>Thanks for reading Phil Windley's Technometria!

<p>I highly recommend that everyone read the&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/Human-Centric-Digital-Identity-Final">“Human-Centric Digital Identity: for Government Officials”</a>&nbsp;whitepaper that&nbsp;Elizabeth Garber&nbsp;and&nbsp;Mark Haine&nbsp;have written, even if you aren’t in government. Published by the <a href="https://openid.net/">OpenID Foundation</a> and co-branded by twelve non-profit organisations, this paper offers a broad view of the global digital identity landscape, key considerations for government officials, and the path ahead to global interoperability. It is also grounded in the key role that digital identity plays in the wider international human rights agenda and the recent OECD Digital Identity Recommendations. </p>



<p>It is really difficult to write about digital identity when trying to put humanity (not individuals) AND society at the center. This paper is a very strong and considerate effort to try and tackle a broad, complicated, but important topic.</p>



<p>Elizabeth was kind enough to acknowledge me in the paper because of our shared viewpoint and discussions on how Value-Sensitive Design and Human-Centric Design are key cogs in building ethical and inclusive digital identity systems. But what she and Mark have tackled goes far beyond what I am able to do, and I do hope to see their work have a big impact on all the Identirati&nbsp;currently engaged in shaping the future of Digital Credentials and Digital Identity.</p>

<p>This article shows how a secure ASP.NET Core application can use Microsoft Entra ID downstream APIs and an in-memory cache. When using in-memory cache and after restarting an application, the tokens are missing for a value session stored in the cookie. The application needs to recover. </p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/bff-aspnetcore-angular">https://github.com/damienbod/bff-aspnetcore-angular</a></p>



<p></p>



 OpenID Connect client setup 



<p>The ASP.NET Core application is secured using OpenID code code with PKCE and the Microsoft Entra ID identity provider. The client is implemented using the Microsoft.Identity.Web Nuget package. The application also requires data from Microsoft Graph. This is implemented using the OBO flow from Microsoft. This uses the delegated access token to acquire a graph access token on behalf of the application and the user. The UI application stores the session in a secure cookie. The downstream API tokens are stored in a cache. If the application is restarted, the tokens are missing and the application needs to recover. You can solve this by forcing a login, or using a persistent cache.</p>



<p></p>







<p></p>



<p>The AddMicrosoftIdentityWebAppAuthentication method is used to setup the Microsoft Identity client.</p>


  var scopes = configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("DownstreamApi:Scopes");
string[] initialScopes = scopes!.Split(' ');

services.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebAppAuthentication(configuration)
    .EnableTokenAcquisitionToCallDownstreamApi(initialScopes)
    .AddMicrosoftGraph("https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0", initialScopes)
    .AddInMemoryTokenCaches();
  


<p></p>



 Microsoft Graph downstream API 



<p>The MsGraphService class implements the Microsoft Graph delegated client using the Microsoft.Identity.Web.GraphServiceClient Nuget package. This uses the Microsoft Graph V5 APIs. As this is a delegated client, the GraphServiceClient can be directly injected into the service and no token acquisition is required. In the original UI client setup, an in-memory cache was used to store the downstream APIs.</p>


  public class MsGraphService
{
    private readonly GraphServiceClient _graphServiceClient;
    private readonly string[] _scopes;

    public MsGraphService(GraphServiceClient graphServiceClient, 
         IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        _graphServiceClient = graphServiceClient;
        var scopes = configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("DownstreamApi:Scopes");
        _scopes = scopes!.Split(' ');
    }

    public async Task&lt;User?&gt; GetGraphApiUser()
    {
        return await _graphServiceClient.Me
            .GetAsync(b =&gt; b.Options.WithScopes(_scopes));
    }
  


<p></p>



 Revoke the session when the tokens are missing 



<p>The RejectSessionCookieWhenAccountNotInCacheEvents class implements the CookieAuthenticationEvents class. This checks the cache if a token exists for the defined scopes. If the token is missing. the cookie session is invalidated and the user must login again. This prevents unwanted exceptions for clients which are hard to recover from.</p>


  using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies;
using Microsoft.Identity.Client;
using Microsoft.Identity.Web;

namespace BffAzureAD.Server;

public class RejectSessionCookieWhenAccountNotInCacheEvents 
       : CookieAuthenticationEvents
{
    private readonly string[] _downstreamScopes;

    public RejectSessionCookieWhenAccountNotInCacheEvents(string[] downstreamScopes)
    {
        _downstreamScopes = downstreamScopes;
    }

    public async override Task ValidatePrincipal(
      CookieValidatePrincipalContext context)
    {
        try
        {
            var tokenAcquisition = context.HttpContext.RequestServices
                .GetRequiredService&lt;ITokenAcquisition&gt;();

            string token = await tokenAcquisition.GetAccessTokenForUserAsync(
                scopes: _downstreamScopes, user: context.Principal);
        }
        catch (MicrosoftIdentityWebChallengeUserException ex)
           when (AccountDoesNotExitInTokenCache(ex))
        {
            context.RejectPrincipal();
        }
    }

    private static bool AccountDoesNotExitInTokenCache(
          MicrosoftIdentityWebChallengeUserException ex)
    {
        return ex.InnerException is MsalUiRequiredException 
            &amp;&amp; (ex.InnerException as MsalUiRequiredException)!.ErrorCode 
                   == "user_null";
    }
}
  


<p></p>



<p>The service is added to the applicaiton and the user will only have cookies with valid in-memory tokens.</p>


  // If using downstream APIs and in memory cache, you need to reset the cookie session if the cache is missing
// If you use persistent cache, you do not require this.
// You can also return the 403 with the required scopes, this needs special handling for ajax calls
// The check is only for single scopes
services.Configure&lt;CookieAuthenticationOptions&gt;(CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme, 
    options =&gt;  options.Events = new RejectSessionCookieWhenAccountNotInCacheEvents(initialScopes));
  


<p></p>



 Alternative solutions 



<p>You can also solve this problem in different ways. One quick way would be to use a persistent cache like Redis or a user session. See the cache link at the bottom from the Microsoft.Identity.Web Wiki. You could also return a HTTP 403 response with the missing tokens and force the UI to reauthenticate requesting the access token for the scopes. This can be complicated when sending ajax requests.</p>



<p>Other ways of solving this problem:</p>



 
 Use a persistent cache 



 Don’t use downstream APIs 



 Return a 403 challenge which requests the missing scopes and this response needs to be handling correctly 
 



<p>Per default using in-memory cache and downstream APIs require extra logic and implementation.</p>

<p>I convened the session “What does Presentation Exchange do and what parts of it do we actually need?” this week at the <a href="https://www.internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop (IIW)</a> to continue the discussion started during <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=2395">two unconference sessions</a> at the <a href="https://oauth.secworkshop.events/osw2023">2023 OAuth Security Workshop</a>.  I briefly summarized the discussions that occurred at OSW, then we had a vigorous discussion of our own.</p>
<p>Key points made were:</p>
 
 There appeared to be rough consensus in the room that Presentation Exchange (PE) is pretty complicated.  People had differing opinions on whether the complexity is worth it. 
 A lot of the complexity of PE comes from being able to request multiple credentials at once and to express alternatives. 
 Ultimately, the verifier knows what kinds of credentials it needs and the relationships between them.  PE tries to let the verifier express some of that to the wallet. 
 Code running in the verifier making choices about the credentials it needs will always be more powerful than PE, because it has the full decision-making facilities of programming languages – including loops, conditionals, etc. 
 Making a composite request for multiple credentials can have a better UX than a sequence of requests.  In some situations, the sequence could result in the person having to scan multiple QR codes.  There may be ways to avoid that, while still having a sequence of requests. 
 Some said that they need the ability to request multiple credentials at once. 
 Brent Zundel (a PE author) suggested that while wallets could implement all of PE, verifiers could implement only the parts they need. 
 Not many parties had implemented all of PE.  Torsten Lodderstedt suggested that we need feedback from developers. 
 We could create a profile of PE, reducing what implementers have to build and correspondingly reducing its expressive power. 
 
<p>The slides used to summarize the preceding discussions are available as <a href="https://self-issued.info/presentations/What_does_PE_do_and_what_do_we_need-Part_3.pptx">PowerPoint</a> and <a href="https://self-issued.info/presentations/What_does_PE_do_and_what_do_we_need-Part_3.pdf">PDF</a>.  There are <a href="https://self-issued.info/presentations/What_does_PE_do_and_what_do_we_need-Part_3_Notes.txt">detailed notes</a> capturing some of the back-and-forth at IIW with attribution.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who participated for an informative and useful discussion.  My goal was to help inform the profiling and deployment choices ahead of us.</p>
<p>P.S.  Since Thursday’s discussion, it occurred to me that a question I wish I’d asked is:</p>
 
 When a verifier needs multiple credentials, they may be in different wallets.  If the verifier tries to make a PE request for multiple credentials that are spread between wallets, will it always fail because no single wallet can satisfy it? 
 
<p>Fodder for the next discussion…</p>

lifecycle. It’s a powerful enabler and fundamental technology underpinning
CipherDoc. I’m so happy to have found it.</p>
 Confusion 
<p>However, the distinction between the SQL/JSON Path operators <code>@@</code> and <code>@?</code>
confused me. Even as I found that the <code>@?</code> operator worked for my needs and <code>@@</code>
did not, I tucked the problem into my mental backlog for later study.</p>
<p>The question arose again on a recent work project, and I can take a hint. It’s
time to figure this thing out. Let’s see where it goes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html#FUNCTIONS-JSON-PROCESSING-TABLE" title="PostgresSQL Docs: JSON Functions and Operators">The docs</a> say:</p>
<blockquote>
 
 <code>jsonb @? jsonpath → boolean</code> 
 Does JSON path return any item for the specified JSON value? 
 
<p><code>'{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}'::jsonb @? '$.a[*] ? (@ &gt; 2)' → t</code></p>
 
 
 <code>jsonb @@ jsonpath → boolean</code> 
 Returns the result of a JSON path predicate check for the specified JSON
value. Only the first item of the result is taken into account. If the
result is not Boolean, then <code>NULL</code> is returned. 
 
<p><code>'{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}'::jsonb @@ '$.a[*] &gt; 2' → t</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These read quite similarly to me: Both return true if the path query returns an
item. So what’s the difference? When should I use <code>@@</code> and when <code>@?</code>? I went so
far as to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/77046554/79202" title="Stack Overflow: What's the difference between the PostgreSQL @? and @@ JSONB Operators?">ask Stack Overflow</a> about it. The <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/77046858/79202">one answer</a> directed my attention
back to the <code>jsonb_path_query()</code> function, which returns the results from a
path query.</p>
<p>So let’s explore how various SQL/JSON Path queries work, what values various
expressions return.</p>
 Queries 
<p><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html#FUNCTIONS-JSON-PROCESSING-TABLE" title="PostgresSQL Docs: JSON Functions and Operators">The docs</a> for <code>jsonb_path_query</code> say:<a>1</a></p>
<blockquote>
 
 <code>jsonb_path_query ( target jsonb, path jsonpath [, vars jsonb [, silent boolean ]] ) → setof jsonb</code> 
 Returns all JSON items returned by the JSON path for the specified JSON
value. If the <code>vars</code> argument is specified, it must be a JSON object, and
its fields provide named values to be substituted into the jsonpath
expression. If the <code>silent</code> argument is specified and is true, the
function suppresses the same errors as the <code>@?</code> and <code>@@</code> operators do. 
 
 <code>select * from jsonb_path_query(
    '{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}',
    '$.a[*] ? (@ &gt;= $min &amp;&amp; @ &lt;= $max)',
    '{"min":2, "max":4}'
) →
 jsonb_path_query
------------------
 2
 3
 4
</code>  
 
</blockquote>
<p>The first thing to note is that a SQL/JSON Path query may return more than one
value. This feature matters for the <code>@@</code> and <code>@?</code> operators, which return a
single boolean value based on the values returned by a path query. And path queries
can return a huge variety of values. Let’s explore some examples, derived from
the sample JSON value and path query from the docs.<a>2</a></p>
 <code>select jsonb_path_query('{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}', '$ ?(@.a[*] &gt; 2)');
    jsonb_path_query    
------------------------
 {"a": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]}
(1 row)
</code> <p>This query returns the entire JSON value, because that’s what <code>$</code> selects at the
start of the path expression. The <code>?()</code> filter returns true because its
predicate expression finds at least one value in the <code>$.a</code> array greater than
<code>2</code>. Here’s what happens when the filter returns false:</p>
 <code>select jsonb_path_query('{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}', '$ ?(@.a[*] &gt; 5)');
 jsonb_path_query 
------------------
(0 rows)
</code> <p>None of the values in the <code>$.a</code> array are greater than five, so the query
returns no value.</p>
<p>To select just the array, append it to the path expression after the <code>?()</code>
filter:</p>
 <code>select jsonb_path_query('{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}', '$ ?(@.a[*] &gt; 2).a');
 jsonb_path_query 
------------------
 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
(1 row)
</code>  Path Modes 
<p>One might think you could select <code>$.a</code> at the start of the path query to get the
full array if the filter returns true, but look what happens:</p>
 <code>select jsonb_path_query('{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}', '$.a ?(@[*] &gt; 2)');
 jsonb_path_query 
------------------
 3
 4
 5
(3 rows)
</code> <p>That’s not the array, but the individual array values that each match the
predicate. Turns out this is a quirk of the Postgres implementation of <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html#STRICT-AND-LAX-MODES" title="PostgresSQL Docs: Strict and Lax modes">path
modes</a>. From what I can glean, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL:2016" title="Wikipedia: “SQL:2016”">SQL:2016</a> standard dictates something like
these <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/json/json-path-expressions-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver16#PATHMODE" title="JSON Path Expressions (SQL Server): Path mode">SQL Server descriptions</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
 
 In lax mode, the function returns empty values if the path expression
contains an error. For example, if you request the value $.name, and the
JSON text doesn’t contain a name key, the function returns null, but
does not raise an error. 
 In strict mode, the function raises an error if the path expression
contains an error. 
 
</blockquote>
<p>But the Postgres lax mode does more than suppress errors. From <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html#STRICT-AND-LAX-MODES" title="PostgresSQL Docs: Strict and Lax modes">the docs</a> (emphasis added):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The lax mode facilitates matching of a JSON document structure and path
expression if the JSON data does not conform to the expected schema. If an
operand does not match the requirements of a particular operation, it can be
automatically wrapped as an SQL/JSON array or unwrapped by converting its
elements into an SQL/JSON sequence before performing this operation.
Besides, comparison operators automatically unwrap their operands in the lax
mode, so you can compare SQL/JSON arrays out-of-the-box.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a few more details, but this is the crux of it: In lax mode, which is
the default, Postgres always unwraps an array. Hence the unexpected list of
results.<a>3</a> This could be particularly confusing when querying multiple
rows:</p>
 <code>select jsonb_path_query(v, '$.a ?(@[*] &gt; 2)')
        from (values ('{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}'::jsonb), ('{"a":[3,5,8]}')) x(v);
 jsonb_path_query 
------------------
 3
 4
 5
 3
 5
 8
(6 rows)
</code> <p>Switching to strict mode by preprending <code>strict</code> to the JSON Path query restores
the expected behavior:</p>
 <code>select jsonb_path_query(v, 'strict $.a ?(@[*] &gt; 2)')
        from (values ('{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}'::jsonb), ('{"a":[3,5,8]}')) x(v);
 jsonb_path_query 
------------------
 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
 [3, 5, 8]
(2 rows)
</code> <p>Important gotcha to watch for, and a good reason to test path queries thoroughly
to ensure you get the results you expect. Lax mode nicely prevents errors when a
query references a path that doesn’t exist, as this simple example demonstrates:</p>
 <code>select jsonb_path_query('{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}', 'strict $.b');
ERROR:  JSON object does not contain key "b"

select jsonb_path_query('{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}', 'lax $.b');
 jsonb_path_query 
------------------
(0 rows)
</code> <p>In general, I suggest always using strict mode when executing queries. Better
still, perhaps always prefer strict mode with our friends the <code>@@</code> and <code>@?</code>
operators, which <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html#FUNCTIONS-JSONB-OP-TABLE" title="PostgreSQL Docs: Additional jsonb Operators">suppress some errors even in strict mode</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The jsonpath operators <code>@?</code> and <code>@@</code> suppress the following errors: missing
object field or array element, unexpected JSON item type, datetime and numeric
errors. The <code>jsonpath</code>-related functions described below can also be told to
suppress these types of errors. This behavior might be helpful when searching
JSON document collections of varying structure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Have a look:</p>
 <code>select '{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}' @? 'strict $.a';
 ?column? 
----------
 t
(1 row)

select '{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}' @? 'strict $.b';
 ?column? 
----------
 &lt;null&gt;
(1 row)
</code> <p>No error for the unknown JSON key <code>b</code> in that second query! As for the error
suppression in the <code>jsonpath</code>-related functions, that’s what the <code>silent</code>
argument does. Compare:</p>
 <code>select jsonb_path_query('{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}', 'strict $.b');
ERROR:  JSON object does not contain key "b"

select jsonb_path_query('{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}', 'strict $.b', '{}', true);
 jsonb_path_query 
------------------
(0 rows)
</code>  Boolean Predicates 
<p>The Postgres <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html#FUNCTIONS-SQLJSON-PATH">SQL/JSON Path Language docs</a> briefly mention a pretty significant
deviation from the SQL standard:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A path expression can be a Boolean predicate, although the SQL/JSON standard
allows predicates only in filters. This is necessary for implementation of the
<code>@@</code> operator. For example, the following <code>jsonpath</code> expression is valid in
PostgreSQL:</p>
<p><code>$.track.segments[*].HR &lt; 70</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This pithy statement has pretty significant implications for the return value
of a path query. The SQL standard allows predicate expressions, which are akin
to an SQL <code>WHERE</code> expression, only in <code>?()</code> filters, as seen previously:</p>
 <code>select jsonb_path_query('{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}', '$ ?(@.a[*] &gt; 2)');
    jsonb_path_query    
------------------------
 {"a": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]}
(1 row)
</code> <p>This can be read as “return the path <code>$</code> if <code>@.a[*] &gt; 2</code> is true. But have a
look at a predicate-only path query:</p>
 <code>select jsonb_path_query('{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}', '$.a[*] &gt; 2');
 jsonb_path_query 
------------------
 true
(1 row)
</code> <p>This path query can be read as “Return the result of the predicate <code>$.a[*] &gt; 2</code>,
which in this case is <code>true</code>. This is quite the divergence from the standard,
which returns contents from the JSON queried, while a predicate query returns
the result of the predicate expression itself. It’s almost like they’re two
different things!</p>
<p>Don’t confuse the predicate path query return value with selecting a boolean
value from the JSON. Consider this example:</p>
 <code>select jsonb_path_query('{"a":[true,false]}', '$.a ?(@[*] == true)');
 jsonb_path_query 
------------------
 true
(1 row)
</code> <p>Looks the same as the predicate-only query, right? But it’s not, as shown by
adding another <code>true</code> value to the <code>$.a</code> array:</p>
 <code>select jsonb_path_query('{"a":[true,false,true]}', '$.a ?(@[*] == true)');
 jsonb_path_query 
------------------
 true
 true
(2 rows)
</code> <p>This path query returns the <code>true</code>s it finds in the <code>$.a</code> array. The fact that
it returns values from the JSON rather than the filter predicate becomes more
apparent in strict mode, which returns all of <code>$a</code> if one or more elements of
the array has the value <code>true</code>:</p>
 <code>select jsonb_path_query('{"a":[true,false,true]}', 'strict $.a ?(@[*] == true)');
  jsonb_path_query   
---------------------
 [true, false, true]
(1 row)
</code> <p>This brief aside, and its mention of the <code>@@</code> operator, turns out to be key to
understanding the difference between <code>@?</code> and <code>@@</code>. Because it’s not just that
this feature is “necessary for implementation of the <code>@@</code> operator”. No, I would
argue that it’s the only kind of expression usable with the <code>@@</code> operator</p>
 Match vs. Exists 
<p>Let’s get back to the <code>@@</code> operator. We can use a boolean predicate JSON Path
like so:</p>
 <code>select '{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}'::jsonb @@ '$.a[*] &gt; 2';
 ?column? 
----------
 t
(1 row)
</code> <p>It returns true because the predicate JSON path query <code>$.a[*] &gt; 2</code> returns true.
And when it returns false?</p>
 <code>select '{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}'::jsonb @@ '$.a[*] &gt; 6';
 ?column? 
----------
 f
(1 row)
</code> <p>So far so good. What happens when we try to use a filter expression that returns
a <code>true</code> value selected from the JSONB?</p>
 <code>select '{"a":[true,false]}'::jsonb @@ '$.a ?(@[*] == true)';
 ?column? 
----------
 t
(1 row)
</code> <p>Looks right, doesn’t it? But recall that this query returns all of the
<code>true</code> values from <code>$.@</code>, but <code>@@</code> wants only a single boolean. What happens
when we add another?</p>
 <code>select '{"a":[true,false,true]}'::jsonb @@ 'strict $.a ?(@[*] == true)';
 ?column? 
----------
 &lt;null&gt;
(1 row)
</code> <p>Now it returns <code>NULL</code>, even though it’s clearly true that <code>@[*] == true</code>
matches. This is because it returns all of the values it matches, as
<code>jsonb_path_query()</code> demonstrates:</p>
 <code>select jsonb_path_query('{"a":[true,false,true]}'::jsonb, '$.a ?(@[*] == true)');
 jsonb_path_query 
------------------
 true
 true
(2 rows)
</code> <p>This clearly violates the <code>@@</code> documentation claim that “Only the first item of
the result is taken into account”. If that were true, it would see the first
value is <code>true</code> and return true. But it doesn’t. Turns out, the corresponding
<code>jsonb_path_match()</code> function shows why:</p>
 <code>select jsonb_path_match('{"a":[true,false,true]}'::jsonb, '$.a ?(@[*] == true)');
ERROR:  single boolean result is expected
</code> <p>Conclusion: The documentation is inaccurate. Only a single boolean is expected
by <code>@@</code>. Anything else is an error.</p>
<p>Futhermore, it’s dangerous, at best, to use an SQL standard JSON Path expression
with <code>@@</code>. If you need to use it with a filter expression, you can turn it into
a boolean predicate by wrapping it in <code>exists()</code>:</p>
 <code>select jsonb_path_match('{"a":[true,false,true]}'::jsonb, 'exists($.a ?(@[*] == true))');
 jsonb_path_match 
------------------
 t
(1 row)
</code> <p>But there’s no reason to do so, because that’s effectively what the <code>@?</code>
operator (and the corresponding, cleverly-named <code>jsonb_path_exists()</code> function
does): it returns true if the SQL standard JSON Path expression contains any
results:</p>
 <code>select '{"a":[true,false,true]}'::jsonb @? '$.a ?(@[*] == true)';
 ?column? 
----------
 t
(1 row)
</code> <p>Here’s the key thing about <code>@?</code>: you don’t want to use a boolean predicate path
query with it, either. Consider this predicate-only query:</p>
 <code>select jsonb_path_query('{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}'::jsonb, '$.a[*] &gt; 6');
 jsonb_path_query 
------------------
 false
(1 row)
</code> <p>But see what happens when we use it with <code>@?</code>:</p>
 <code>select '{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}'::jsonb @? '$.a[*] &gt; 6';
 ?column? 
----------
 t
(1 row)
</code> <p>It returns true even though the query itself returns false! Why? Because <code>false</code>
is a value that exists and is returned by the query. Even a query that returns
<code>null</code> is considered to exist, as it will when a strict query encounters an
error:</p>
 <code>select jsonb_path_query('{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}'::jsonb, 'strict $[*] &gt; 6');
 jsonb_path_query 
------------------
 null
(1 row)

select '{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}'::jsonb @? 'strict $[*] &gt; 6';
 ?column? 
----------
 t
(1 row)
</code> <p>The key thing to know about the <code>@?</code> operator is that it returns true if
anything is returned by the path query, and returns false only if nothing is
selected at all.</p>
 The Difference 
<p>In summary, the difference between the <code>@?</code> and <code>@@</code> JSONB operators is this:</p>
 
 <code>@?</code> (and <code>jsonb_path_exists()</code>) returns true if the path query returns any
values — even <code>false</code> or <code>null</code> — and false if it returns no values.
This operator should be used only with SQL-standard JSON path queries that
select data from the JSONB. Do not use predicate-only JSON path expressions
with <code>@?</code>. 
 <code>@@</code> (and <code>jsonb_path_match()</code>) returns true if the path query returns the
single boolean value <code>true</code> and false otherwise. This operator should be
used only with Postgres-specific boolean predicate JSON path queries,
that return data from the predicate expression. Do not use SQL-standard JSON
path expressions with <code>@@</code>. 
 
<p>This difference of course assumes awareness of this distinction between
predicate path queries and SQL standard path queries. To that end, I <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/7262A188-59CA-4A8A-AAD7-83D4FF0B9758%40justatheory.com" title="pgsql-hackers — Patch: Improve Boolean Predicate JSON Path Docs">submitted
a patch</a> that expounds the difference between these types of JSON Path
queries, and plan to submit another linking these differences in the docs for
<code>@@</code> and <code>@?</code>.</p>
<p>Oh, and probably another to explain the difference in return values between
strict and lax queries due to array unwrapping.</p>

<p>Many thanks to <a href="https://github.com/ewie" title="GitHub: Erik Wienhold">Erik Wienhold</a> for patiently answering my <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/flat/15DD78A5-B5C4-4332-ACFE-55723259C07F%40justatheory.com" title="pgsql-hackers —&nbsp;JSON Path and GIN Questions">pgsql-hackers

oddities of <code>@@</code> were previously discussed in detail.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Well almost. The docs for <code>jsonb_path_query</code> actually say, about the
last two arguments, “The optional <code>vars</code> and <code>silent</code> arguments act the same
as for <code>jsonb_path_exists</code>.” I replaced that sentence with the relevant
sentences from the <code>jsonb_path_exists</code> docs, about which more later.&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a></p>
 
 
<p>Though omitting the <code>vars</code> argument, as variable interpolation just
gets in the way of understanding basic query result behavior.&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a></p>
 
 
<p>In fairness, the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/adjsn/json-path-expressions.html#GUID-8656CAB9-C293-4A99-BB62-F38F3CFC4C13" title="Oracle Database JSON Developer’s Guide: SQL/JSON Path Expression Syntax Relaxation">Oracle docs</a> also discuss “implicit array
wrapping and unwrapping”, but I don’t have a recent Oracle server to
experiment with at the moment.&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a></p>

<p>Experiments with JSON-LD VC payloads secured by JWS vs. Data Integrity<br>Detailed results: <a href="https://github.com/peacekeeper/json-ld-vcs-not-just-json">https://github.com/peacekeeper/json-ld-vcs-not-just-json</a></p><p>In the world of Verifiable Credentials (VCs), it can be hard to keep track of various evolving formats and data models. A potpourri of similar-sounding terms can be found in specification documents, mailing lists and meeting notes, such as VCDM, VC-JWT, VC-JWS, JWT VCs, SD-JWT, SD-JWT-VC, SD JWS, VC JOSE COSE, SDVC, JsonWebSignature2020, etc.</p><p>Also, statements like the following can frequently be found in discussions:</p>  “Can we make @context optional. It’s simpler and not always&nbsp;needed.”  “If you don’t want to use @context and just ignore it, you&nbsp;could.”  “You can secure a JSON-LD VC using&nbsp;JWT.”  “You can use SD-JWT for any JSON payload, including JSON-LD.”  “JSON-LD is&nbsp;JSON.”  <p>One concrete question related to this is what it means if a VC using the JSON-LD-based W3C VC Data Model is secured by proof mechanisms that were designed without JSON-LD in&nbsp;mind.</p> Experimentation <p>To explore this, I conducted two experiments to describe what happens if you take a JSON-LD document based on the W3C VC Data Model, and you secure it once with <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-jose-cose/">JWS</a>, and once with <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-integrity/">Data Integrity</a>. The former signs the document, while the latter signs the underlying RDF graph of the document. The part where this gets interesting is the JSON-LD @context. For JWS, only the contents of the document matter. For Data Integrity, the contents of the @context matter as well. The two proof mechanisms have a rather different understanding of the “payload” that is to be&nbsp;secured.</p> Experiment #1: Data Integrity changes, JWS&nbsp;doesn’t <p>In the first experiment, we start with a JSON-LD document named <a href="https://github.com/peacekeeper/json-ld-not-just-json/blob/main/examples/example1a.input">example1a.input</a>. This document references a JSON-LD @context <a href="https://example.com/context1/,">https://example.com/context1/,</a> and the contents of that @context are as in the file <a href="https://github.com/peacekeeper/json-ld-not-just-json/blob/main/contexts/context1a.jsonld">context1a.jsonld</a>.</p><p>In a subsequent variation of this, we start with another JSON-LD document named <a href="https://github.com/peacekeeper/json-ld-not-just-json/blob/main/examples/example1b.input">example1b.input</a>, which is equivalent to the above example1a.input. This document also references the same JSON-LD @context <a href="https://example.com/context1/,">https://example.com/context1/,</a> but now, the contents of that @context are as in the file <a href="https://github.com/peacekeeper/json-ld-not-just-json/blob/main/contexts/context1b.jsonld">context1b.jsonld</a>, which is different from the file context1a.jsonld that was used&nbsp;above.</p><p>The result: If the contents of the JSON-LD @context change, even if the JSON-LD document stays the same, the Data Integrity signature also changes, whereas the JWS signature doesn’t change. This also means that verifying a Data Integrity signature would fail, whereas verifying a JWS signature would&nbsp;succeed.</p> Experiment #2: JWS changes, Data Integrity doesn’t <p>In the second experiment, we start with a JSON-LD document named <a href="https://github.com/peacekeeper/json-ld-not-just-json/blob/main/examples/example2a.input">example2a.input</a>. This document references a JSON-LD @context <a href="https://example.com/context2a/,">https://example.com/context2a/,</a> and the contents of that @context are as in the file <a href="https://github.com/peacekeeper/json-ld-not-just-json/blob/main/contexts/context2a.jsonld">context2a.jsonld</a>.</p><p>In a subsequent variation of this, we start with another JSON-LD document named <a href="https://github.com/peacekeeper/json-ld-not-just-json/blob/main/examples/example2b.input">example2b.input</a>, which is different from the above example2a.input. The difference is that the first document used the term “givenName”, while the second document uses the term “firstName”. The second document references a different JSON-LD @context <a href="https://example.com/context2b/,">https://example.com/context2b/,</a> and the contents of that @context are as in the file <a href="https://github.com/peacekeeper/json-ld-not-just-json/blob/main/contexts/context2b.jsonld">context2b.jsonld</a>, which is different from the file context2a.jsonld that was used above. The difference is that the first @context defines the term “givenName”, while the second @context defines the term “firstName”, however, they define them using the same URI, i.e. with equivalent semantics.</p><p>The result: Despite the fact that the JSON-LD document changes, the Data Integrity signature doesn’t change, whereas the JWS signature changes. This is because Data Integrity “understands” that even though the document has changed, the semantics of the RDF graph are still the same. JWS on the other hand “sees” only the JSON-LD document, not the semantics behind it. This also means that verifying a Data Integrity signature would succeed, whereas verifying a JWS signature would&nbsp;fail.</p> Conclusion <p>Depending on your perspective, you could interpret the results in different ways. You could call Data Integrity insecure, since it depends on information outside the JSON document. You could also call JWS insecure, since it fails to secure the JSON-LD data&nbsp;model.</p><p>The real point of this article is however NOT to say that any of the mentioned data models or proof mechanisms are inherently insecure, but rather to raise awareness of the nuances. To say “JSON-LD is JSON” is correct on the document layer, and wrong on the data model layer. Certain combinations of data models and proof mechanisms can lead to surprising results, if they are not understood properly.</p>

<p>This article shows how to implement identity verification in a solution using ASP.NET Core and trinsic.id, built using an id-tech solution based on self sovereign identity principals. The credential issuer uses OpenID Connect to authenticate, implemented using Microsoft Entra ID. The edge or web wallet authenticates using trinsic.id based on a single factor email code. The verifier needs no authentication, it only verifies that the verifiable credential is authentic and valid. The verifiable credentials uses JSON-LD ZKP with BBS+ Signatures and selective disclosure to verify.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/swiss-ssi-group/TrinsicV2AspNetCore">https://github.com/swiss-ssi-group/TrinsicV2AspNetCore</a> </p>



<p>History</p>



 
 2023-12-02 Updated .NET 8 
 



 Use Case 



<p>As a university administrator, I want to create BBS+ verifiable credentials templates for university diplomas.</p>



<p>As a student, I want to authenticate using my university account (OpenID Connect Code flow with PKCE), create my verifiable credential and download this credential to my SSI Wallet.</p>



<p>As an HR employee, I want to verify the job candidate has a degree from this university. The HR employee needs verification but does not require to see the data.</p>



 
 The sample creates university diplomas as verifiable credentials with BBS+ signatures. 



 The credentials are issued using OIDC with strong authentication (If possible) to a candidate mobile wallet. 



 The issuer uses a trust registry so that the verifier can validate that the VC is authentic. 



 The verifier uses BBS+ selective disclosure to validate a diploma. (ZKP is not possible at present) 



 The university application requires an admin zone and a student zone. 
 



 Setup 



 
 The university application plays the role of credential issuer and has it’s own users. 



 Trinsic.id wallet is used to store the verifiable credentials for students. 



 Company X HR plays the role of verifier and has no connection to the university. The company has a list of trusted universities. (DIDs) 
 



 Issuing a credential 



<p>The ASP.NET Core issuer application can create a new issuer web (edge) wallet, create templates and issue credentials using the template. The trinsic.id .NET SDK is used to implement the SSI or id-tech integration. How and where trinsic.id store the data is unknown, and you must trust them to do this correctly if you use their solution. Implementing your own ledger or identity layer is at present too much effort and so the best option is to use one of the integration solutions. The UI is implemented using ASP.NET Core Razor pages and the Microsoft.Identity.Web Nuget package with Microsoft Entra ID for the authentication. The required issuer template is used to create the credential offer.</p>


  var diploma = await _universityServices.GetUniversityDiploma(DiplomaTemplateId);

var tid = Convert.ToInt32(DiplomaTemplateId, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);

var response = await _universityServices
	.IssuerStudentDiplomaCredentialOffer(diploma, tid);

CredentialOfferUrl = response!.ShareUrl;
  


<p>The IssuerStudentDiplomaCredentialOffer method uses the University eco system and issuer a new offer using it’s template.</p>



<p></p>


  public async Task&lt;CreateCredentialOfferResponse?&gt; IssuerStudentDiplomaCredentialOffer
	(Diploma diploma, int universityDiplomaTemplateId)
{
	var templateId = await 
		GetUniversityDiplomaTemplateId(universityDiplomaTemplateId);
	// get the template from the id-tech solution
	var templateResponse = await GetUniversityDiplomaTemplate(templateId!);

	// Auth token from University issuer wallet
	_trinsicService.Options.AuthToken = 
		_configuration["TrinsicOptions:IssuerAuthToken"];

	var response = await _trinsicService
		.Credential.CreateCredentialOfferAsync(
			new CreateCredentialOfferRequest
			{
				TemplateId = templateResponse.Template.Id,
				ValuesJson = JsonSerializer.Serialize(diploma),
				GenerateShareUrl = true
			});

	return response;
}
  


<p>The UI returns the offer and displays this as a QR code which can be opened and starts to process to add the credential to the web wallet. This is a magic link and not an SSI OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance flow or the starting point for a Didcomm V2 flow. Starting any flow using a QR Code is unsafe and further protection is required. Using an authenticated application with a phishing resistant authentication reduces this risk or using OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance VC issuing.</p>







<p></p>



 Creating a proof in the wallet 



<p>Once the credential is in the holders wallet, a proof can be created from it. The proof can be used in a verifier application. The wallet authentication of the user is implemented using a single factor email code and creates a selective proof which can be copied to the verifier web application. OpenID for Verifiable Presentations for verifiers cannot be used because there is no connection between the issuer and the verifier. This could be possible if the process was delegated to the wallet using some type of magic URL, string etc. The wallet can authenticate against any known eco systems.</p>


  public class GenerateProofService
{
    private readonly TrinsicService _trinsicService;
    private readonly IConfiguration _configuration;

    public List&lt;SelectListItem&gt; Universities = new();

    public GenerateProofService(TrinsicService trinsicService, IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        _trinsicService = trinsicService;
        _configuration = configuration;

        Universities = _configuration.GetSection("Universities")!.Get&lt;List&lt;SelectListItem&gt;&gt;()!;
    }

    public async Task&lt;List&lt;SelectListItem&gt;&gt; GetItemsInWallet(string userAuthToken)
    {
        var results = new List&lt;SelectListItem&gt;();
        // Auth token from user 
        _trinsicService.Options.AuthToken = userAuthToken;

        // get all items
        var items = await _trinsicService.Wallet.SearchWalletAsync(new SearchRequest());
        foreach (var item in items.Items)
        {
            var jsonObject = JsonNode.Parse(item)!;
            var id = jsonObject["id"];
            var vcArray = jsonObject["data"]!["type"];
            var vc = string.Empty;
            foreach (var i in vcArray!.AsArray())
            {
                var val = i!.ToString();
                if (val != "VerifiableCredential")
                {
                    vc = val!.ToString();
                    break;
                }
            }

            results.Add(new SelectListItem(vc, id!.ToString()));
        }

        return results;
    }

    public async Task&lt;CreateProofResponse&gt; CreateProof(string userAuthToken, string credentialItemId)
    {
        // Auth token from user 
        _trinsicService.Options.AuthToken = userAuthToken;

        var selectiveProof = await _trinsicService.Credential.CreateProofAsync(new()
        {
            ItemId = credentialItemId,
            RevealTemplate = new()
            {
                TemplateAttributes = { "firstName", "lastName", "dateOfBirth", "diplomaTitle" }
            }
        });

        return selectiveProof;
    }

    public AuthenticateInitResponse AuthenticateInit(string userId, string universityEcosystemId)
    {
        var requestInit = new AuthenticateInitRequest
        {
            Identity = userId,
            Provider = IdentityProvider.Email,
            EcosystemId = universityEcosystemId
        };

        var authenticateInitResponse = _trinsicService.Wallet.AuthenticateInit(requestInit);

        return authenticateInitResponse;
    }

    public AuthenticateConfirmResponse AuthenticateConfirm(string code, string challenge)
    {
        var requestConfirm = new AuthenticateConfirmRequest
        {
            Challenge = challenge,
            Response = code
        };
        var authenticateConfirmResponse = _trinsicService.Wallet.AuthenticateConfirm(requestConfirm);

        return authenticateConfirmResponse;
    }
}
  


<p>The wallet connect screen can look some like this:</p>







<p>The proof can be created using one of the credentials and the proof can be copied.</p>







<p></p>



 Verifying the proof 



<p>The verifier can use the proof to validate the required information. The verifier has no connection to the issuer, it is in a different eco system. Because of this, the verifier must validate the issuer DID. This must be a trusted issuer (university).</p>


  public class DiplomaVerifyService
{
    private readonly TrinsicService _trinsicService;
    private readonly IConfiguration _configuration;

 
    public List&lt;SelectListItem&gt; TrustedUniversities = new();
    public List&lt;SelectListItem&gt; TrustedCredentials = new();

    public DiplomaVerifyService(TrinsicService trinsicService, IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        _trinsicService = trinsicService;
        _configuration = configuration;

        TrustedUniversities = _configuration.GetSection("TrustedUniversities")!.Get&lt;List&lt;SelectListItem&gt;&gt;()!;
        TrustedCredentials = _configuration.GetSection("TrustedCredentials")!.Get&lt;List&lt;SelectListItem&gt;&gt;()!;
    }

    public async Task&lt;(VerifyProofResponse? Proof, bool IsValid)&gt; Verify(string studentProof, string universityIssuer)
    {
        // Verifiers auth token
        // Auth token from trinsic.id root API KEY provider
        _trinsicService.Options.AuthToken = _configuration["TrinsicCompanyXHumanResourcesOptions:ApiKey"];

        var verifyProofResponse = await _trinsicService.Credential.VerifyProofAsync(new VerifyProofRequest
        {
            ProofDocumentJson = studentProof,
        });

        var jsonObject = JsonNode.Parse(studentProof)!;
        var issuer = jsonObject["issuer"];

        // check issuer
        if (universityIssuer != issuer!.ToString())
        {
            return (null, false);
        }

        return (verifyProofResponse, true);
    }
}
  


<p>The ASP.NET Core UI could look something like this:</p>

 Notes 



<p>Using a SSI based solution to share data securely across domains or eco systems can be very useful and opens up many business possibilities. SSI or id-tech is a good solution for identity checks and credential checks, it is not a good solution for authentication. Phishing is hard to solve in cross device environments. Passkeys or FIDO2 is the way forward for user authentication. The biggest problem for SSI and id-tech is the interoperability between solutions. For example, the following credential types exist and are only useable on specific solutions:</p>



 
 JSON JWT 



 SD-JWT (JSON-LD with LD Signatures) 



 AnonCreds with CL Signatures 



 JSON-LD ZKP with BBS+ Signatures 



 mDL ISO ISO/IEC 18013-5 
 



<p>There are multiple standards, multiple solutions, multiple networks and multiple ledgers. No two systems seem to work with each other. In a closed eco system, it will work, but SSI has few advantages over existing solutions in a closed eco system. Interoperability needs to be solved.</p>

<p>Writing this post is hard, because the emotions are still fresh and very raw. In so many ways, I feel like I was only just beginning to know Vittorio Luigi Bertocci.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, we all feel like we “know” him, because he has always been a larger-than-life character operating at the very forefront of our industry, driving the development of some of the most important of our industry standards efforts, and leading the effort to educate technologists everywhere through his conference talks and educational videos, blogs, and articles. His enthusiasm, humor, and depth of knowledge would make his talks on even the driest of topics engaging and effective. He was so incredibly open on social media, sharing everything from his travel experiences, to his experiments in health data tracking, to his misadventures in Starbucks naming. He was always willing to engage in conversation with anyone and everyone on a wide variety of topics – on identity, on books and science fiction, on philosophy. And he was not shy about sharing his opinions. But more than anything, he was always ready to help someone breaking into our complex and confusing world of identity. He would often say that it was driven by his narcissism. But even if that were true, at the core of it was a desire to make sure we were all working towards making identity better.</p>



<p>Yes, we have all felt like we “know” him. Who else in identity has an anime character? Who else but him could pull off literally stopping mid sentence during a conference talk to pose for the photographer? And that hair!</p>


 
<a href="https://7ee14c.p3cdn1.secureserver.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/WithVittorio.jpg"></a> 


<p>But it was only in these last few months, as he learnt about and tried to battle the disease that took him away from us, did I get to know just how much the public persona was not a facade. He reached out and connected with many of us, with the kind of honesty, openness, love, and vulnerability that I do not think I would ever be capable of. And in doing so, he did what he always did best – he taught a bunch of us so much about ourselves, about each other, and brought us together in a way that would have been damn near impossible if it weren’t for him.</p>



<p>We have all been robbed, because Vittorio has been taken from us way, way too soon. But we have also been given a gift, one that goes way beyond Vittorio’s contributions to the field of digital identity that in no small measure have enabled all of us to make a living. The memories that live in our hearts, the lessons on what it means to be one of the identirati, and the passion for life itself that he exemplified, and that I now feel compelled to try and emulate – this will be his legacy, for me at least.</p>



<p>Love you Vittorio. Forever.</p>

But the benefits go far beyond better security. </p><p>A few weeks ago, I came across this <a href="https://www.citizenme.com/the-future-of-data-is-zero-data/">article from StJohn Deakin from 2020 about </a><a href="https://www.citizenme.com/the-future-of-data-is-zero-data/">zero data</a>. I've been <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2023/08/zero_trust.shtml">thinking a lot about zero trust</a> lately, so the name leapt out at me. I immediately knew what StJohn was speaking about because I've been talking about it too. My new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1098117697/technometria-20">Learning Digital Identity</a>, talks about the concept. But the name—zero data—is simply brilliant. I want to dig into zero data in this post. I'll discuss the link between zero data and zero trust in a future post.</p><p>StJohn describes the idea like this:</p><blockquote><p>Personal data should be held by humans first, and by the companies, organisations and governments that humans choose to interact with, second. The ultimate in ‘data minimisation’ is for the platforms in the centre to simply facilitate the interactions and not hold any data at all. This is the exact opposite of our Google/Facebook/Amazon dominated world where all human data is being concentrated in a few global silos.</p><p>A zero data society doesn’t mean that data isn’t shared between us, quite the opposite. With increased trust and participation, the data available and needed to drive our global society will explode exponentially.</p><p>From <a href="https://www.citizenme.com/the-future-of-data-is-zero-data/">The Future of Data is ‘Zero Data’</a><br>Referenced 2023-09-30T17:37:15-0600</p></blockquote><p>If you think about this in the context of how the internet has worked for the last three decades, the concept of zero data might seem baffling. Yet, consider a day in your life. How often do you establish lasting relationships—and thus share detailed information about yourself—with every individual or entity you come across? Almost never. It would be absurd to think that every time you grab a coffee from the local store, you'd need to form a lasting bond with the coffee machine, the cashier, the credit card terminal, and other customers just to facilitate your purchase. Instead, we exchange only the essential information required, and relevant parties retain just the data that is needed long term.</p><p>To build a zero data infrastructure we need to transfer trustworthy data just-in-time. <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/12/verifiable_credential_exchange.shtml">Verifiable credentials</a> (VCs) offer a way to represent information so that its authenticity can be verified through cryptographic means. They can be thought of as digital attestations or proofs that are created by an issuer about a subject and are presented by the holder to a verifier as required. </p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85d2af5e-4625-42c5-bf60-f69e2dbfbe24.heic">    </a>Verifiable Credential Exchange  <p>Here are some of the interaction patterns facilitated by verifiable credentials:</p>  <p>Selective Disclosure: VCs enable users to share only specific parts of a credential. For instance, a user can prove they are of legal age without revealing their exact date of birth.</p>  <p>Credential Chaining: Multiple credentials can be linked together, enabling more complex proofs and interactions. For example, an employer might hire an employee only after receiving a VC proving they graduated and another proving their right to work.</p>  <p>Holder-Driven Data Exchange: Instead of organizations pulling data about users, VCs shift the interaction model to users pushing verifiable claims to organizations when needed.</p>  <p>Anonymous Credential Proofs: VCs can be designed to be presented anonymously, allowing users to prove a claim about themselves without revealing their identity. For example, VCs can be used to prove the customer is a human with less friction than CAPTCHAs.</p>  <p>Proofs without Data Transfer: Instead of transferring actual data, users can provide cryptographic proofs that they possess certain data or prove predicates about the data, reducing the exposure of personal information. For example, VCs can be used to prove that the subject is over 21 without revealing who the subject is or even their birthdate.</p>  <p>Adaptive Authentication: Depending on the sensitivity of an online interaction, users can be prompted to provide VCs of varying levels of assurance, enhancing security in adaptable ways. I plan to talk about this more in my next post about zero data and zero trust.</p>  <p>These interaction patterns change traditional data management and verification models, enabling businesses to retain considerably less data on their clients. Verifiable credentials have numerous benefits and features of that provide a positive impact on data management, security, and user trust:</p>  <p>Data Minimization: As we've seen, with VCs, users can prove facts without revealing detailed data. By selectively sharing parts of a credential, business only see necessary information, leading to overall reduced data storage and processing requirements.</p>  <p>Reduced Redundancy &amp; Data Management: Trustworthy VCs reduce the need for duplicate data, simplifying data management. There's less need to track, backup, and maintain excess data, reducing complexity and associated costs.</p>  <p>Expiration, Revocation, &amp; Freshness of Data: VCs can be designed with expiration dates and can be revocable. This ensures verifiers rely on up-to-date credentials rather than outdated data in long-term databases.</p>  <p>Trust through Standardized Protocols: VCs, built on standardized protocols, enable a <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2017/01/a_universal_trust_framework.shtml">universal trust framework</a>. Multiple businesses can thus trust and verify the same credential, benefiting from reduced integration burdens and ensuring less custom development.</p>  <p>Enhanced Security &amp; Reduced Exposure to Threats: Data minimization reduces the size of the so-called honey pot, reducing the attraction for cyber-attacks and, in the event of a breach, limit the potential damage, both in terms of data exposed and reputational harm.</p>  <p>Compliance, Regulatory Benefits &amp; Reduced Liability: Adhering to data minimization aligns with many regulations, reducing potential legal complications. Storing minimal data also decreases organizational liability and regulatory scrutiny.</p>  <p>Cost Efficiency: By storing less data, organizations can achieve significant savings in storage infrastructure and IT operations, while also benefiting from focused data analytics.</p>  <p>Enhanced User Trust &amp; Reputation: By collecting only essential data, organizations can build trust with users, gaining a competitive edge in a privacy-conscious market that is increasingly growing tired of the abuses of <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/05/can_the_digital_future_be_our_home.shtml">surveillance capitalism</a>.</p>  <p>In essence, verifiable credentials shift the paradigm from "data collection and storage" to "data verification and trust." Online interactions are provided with the assurance they need without the business incurring the overhead (and risk) of storing excessive customer data. Zero data strategies not only reduce the potential attack surface for cyber threats but also offers a variety of operational, financial, and compliance benefits.</p><p>The biggest objection to a zero data strategy is likely due to its decentralized nature. Troves of user data make people comfortable by giving them the illusion of ready access to the data they need, when they need it. The truth is that the data is often unverified and stale. Nevertheless, it is the prevailing mindset. Gettng used to just-in-time, trustworthy data requires changing attitudes about how we work online. But the advantages are compelling.</p><p>And, if your business model depends on selling data about your customers to others (or facilitating their use of this data in, say, an ad network) then giving up your store of data may threaten precious business models. But this isn’t an issue for most businesses who just want to facilitate transactions with minimal friction.</p><p>Zero data aligns our online existence more closely with our real-world interactions, fostering new methods of communication while decreasing the challenges and risks associated with amassing, storing, and utilizing vast amounts of data. When your customers can prove things about themselves in real time, you'll see several benefits beyond just better security:</p>  <p>Reduced Sign-Up Friction: For services that rely on verified attributes (e.g., age, membership status, qualifications), users can <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2023/01/better_onboarding_with_verifiable_credentials.shtml">provide these attributes quickly with VCs, eliminating lengthy sign-up or verification processes</a>.</p>  <p>Cross-Platform Verification: A VC issued by one service can be verified and trusted by another, facilitating smoother cross-platform interactions and reducing the need for users to repetitively provide the same information.</p>  <p>Fewer intermediaries: VCs can allow for <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/06/held_hostage.shtml">direct trust between parties without the need for a centralized authority</a>. This fosters more direct and decentralized interactions.</p>  <p>Zero data, facilitated by verifiable credentials, represents a pivotal transition in how digital identity is used in online interactions. By minimizing centralized data storage and emphasizing cryptographic verifiability, this approach aims to address the prevalent challenges in data management, security, and user trust. Allowing online interactions to more faithfully follow established patterns of transferring trust from the physical world, the model promotes just-in-time data exchanges and reduces unnecessary data storage. As both businesses and individual users grapple with the increasing complexities of digital interactions, the integration of verifiable credentials and a zero data framework stands out as a practical, friction-reducing, security-enhancing solution for the modern digital landscape.</p>

<p>This article shows how to implement a secure web application using <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/introduction-to-aspnet-core">ASP.NET Core</a>. The web application implements the backend for frontend security architecture (BFF) and deploys both technical stack distributions as one web application. HTTP only secure cookies are used to persist the session. Microsoft Entra ID is used as the identity provider and the token issuer.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/bff-aspnetcore-vuejs">https://github.com/damienbod/bff-aspnetcore-vuejs</a></p>



 Overview 



<p>The solution is deployed as a single OpenID Connect confidential client using the Microsoft Entra ID identity provider. The OpenID Connect client authenticates using the code flow with PKCE and a secret or a certificate. I use secrets in development and certificates in production deployments. The UI part of the solution is deployed as part of the server application. Secure HTTP only cookies are used to persist the session after a successful authentication. No security flows are implemented in the client part of the application. No sensitive data like tokens are exposed in the client browser. By removing the security from the client, the security is improved and the complexity is reduced.</p>







<p></p>



 Setup Vue.js application 



<p>The Vue.js UI is setup so that the default development environment is used like in any Vue.js standalone application. A reverse proxy is used to integrate the application into the secure backend development environment. The UI uses Vue.js 3 with Typescript and Vite. </p>



 HTTPS setup and Production build 



<p>The production build is used to add the application as a UI view in the server rendered application, in this case ASP.NET Core. I always use HTTPS in development, so that the errors are discovered early and a strong CSP can also be used. This is all setup in the <a href="https://vitejs.dev/">vite</a> project file.</p>


  import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'
import fs from 'fs';

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [vue()],
  server: {
    https: {
		key: fs.readFileSync('./certs/dev_localhost.key'),
		cert: fs.readFileSync('./certs/dev_localhost.pem'),
	},
    port: 4202,
    strictPort: true, // exit if port is in use
    hmr: {
      clientPort: 4202, 
    },
  },
  optimizeDeps: {
    force: true,
  },
  build: {
    outDir: "../server/wwwroot",
    emptyOutDir: true
  },
})
  


<p></p>



 CSP setup 



<p>The CSP is setup to use nonces both in development and production. This will save time fixing CSP issues before you go live. Vue.js creates scripts and styles on a build or a npm dev (vite). The scripts require the nonce. The styles require a nonce in production. To add the server created nonce, the index.html file uses a meta tag in the header as well as the server rendered middleware parsing for scripts and styles. The nonce gets added and updated with a new value on every HTTP response. This can be used directly in the Vue.js code. When adding further script statically or dynamically, the nonce placeholder can be used. This gets updated dynamically in development and production environments.</p>


  &lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="UTF-8" /&gt;
	&lt;meta name="CSP_NONCE" content="**PLACEHOLDER_NONCE_SERVER**" /&gt;
    &lt;link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/vite.svg" /&gt;
    &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" /&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Vite + Vue + TS&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div id="app"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    /src/main.ts
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
  


<p>The ASP.NET Core _host file is used to serve up the index.html and adds in the dynamic bits to the Vue.js application. The scripts and styles have a nonce applied in production and the scripts in the development environment. Added and replace the CSP nonce can be done in different ways and needs to match the Vue.js index.html. This can change, depending on the setup of the Vue.js index.html.</p>

    Response.Cookies.Append("XSRF-RequestToken", requestToken ?? "", new CookieOptions() { HttpOnly = false, IsEssential = true, Secure = true, SameSite = SameSiteMode.Strict });
}

@Html.Raw(source)
  


 Anti-forgery protection 



<p>Cookies are used to store the session authentication. The authentication cookie is a HTTP only secure cookie only for its domain. Browser Same Site protection helps secure the session. Old browsers do not support Same Site and Anti-forgery protection is still required. You can add this protection in two ways. I use a CSRF anti-forgery cookie. You could also use custom headers with validation. The getCookie script gets the anti-forgery cookie which was created by the server. This cookie is not HTTP only because it needs to be read into the UI. </p>


  export const getCookie = (cookieName: string) =&gt; {
  const name = `${cookieName}=`;
  const decodedCookie = decodeURIComponent(document.cookie);
  const ca = decodedCookie.split(";");
  for (let i = 0; i &lt; ca.length; i += 1) {
    let c = ca[i];
    while (c.charAt(0) === " ") {
      c = c.substring(1);
    }
    if (c.indexOf(name) === 0) {
      return c.substring(name.length, c.length);
    }
  }
  return "";
};
  


<p>The Anti-forgery header is added to every API call which requires this. I use axios to request API data, and the header needs to be added to the axiosConfig. For the demo, I just implemented this directly the Vue js component. The component makes various API calls.</p>


  &lt;script setup lang="ts"&gt;
import ResultsDisplay from './ResultsDisplay.vue'
import axios from 'axios';
import { ref, onMounted } from 'vue'
import { getCookie } from '../getCookie';

const isLoggedIn = ref&lt;boolean&gt;()
const currentUser = ref&lt;any&gt;()
const jsonResponse = ref&lt;any&gt;()

onMounted(() =&gt; {
  getUserProfile()
})

const axiosConfig = {
  headers:{

 Setup ASP.NET Core application 



<p>The ASP.NET Core project is setup to host the static html file from Vue.js and respond to all HTTP requests as defined using the APIs. The nonce is added to the index.html file. <a href="https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-identity-web">Microsoft.Identity.Web</a> is used to authenticate the user and the application. The session is stored in a cookie. The <a href="https://github.com/andrewlock/NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders">NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders</a> Nuget package is used to add the security headers and the CSP.</p>

 Setup Azure App registration 



<p>The application is deployed as one. The application consists of two parts, the Vue.js part and the ASP.NET Core part. These are tightly coupled (business) even if the technical stacks are not. This is an OpenID Connect confidential client with a user secret or a certification for client assertion.</p>



<p>Use the Web client type on setup.</p>







<p></p>



 Development environment 



<p>Developers require a professional development setup and should use the technical stacks like the creators of the tech stacks recommend. Default development environments is the aim and always the easiest to maintain. The Vue.js project uses a default vite environment or best practices as the Vue.js community recommends. The server part of the application must proxy all UI requests to the Vue.js development environment. I use Microsoft YARP reverse proxy to implement this. This is only required for development in this setup. Some flavors of the BFF use proxies int eh production environments as well.</p>







<p></p>



 Testing and running 



<p>The appsettings.json MUST be updated with your Azure tenant Azure App registration values. If using a client secret, store this in the user secrets for development, or in a key vault when deployed to Azure.</p>


    "MicrosoftEntraID": {
    "Instance": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/",

 Debugging 



<p>Start the Vue.js project from the&nbsp;ui&nbsp;folder</p>


  npm start
  


<p>Start the ASP.NET Core project from the&nbsp;server&nbsp;folder</p>


  dotnet run
  


<p>When the localhost of the server app is opened, you can authenticate and use.</p>



 Notes 



<p>I was not able to apply the nonce to the dev environment styles of the Vue.js part. This would be of great benefit as you can prevent insecure styles in development and not discover these problems after a deployment. In the production build, the nonce is applied correctly.</p>

<p>Jason and I will be hitting the road to explore Arkansas in a few days. We’ll be away until the end of the month scouting potential landing spots for the next chapter in my life. Over the course of the last 48 hours, I’ve had many interconnected realizations; or if not fully new realizations, then ones that helped clarify my thinking in deep, meaningful ways. The cascade of ideas in today’s stream resulted from Stephers sending me this1930s paper yesterday morning.</p>
<p><a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Electro-Dynamic-Theory-of-Life-H.S.-Burr-and-F.S.C.-Northrop.pdf"></a></p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Electro-Dynamic-Theory-of-Life-H.S.-Burr-and-F.S.C.-Northrop.pdf&nbsp;">https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Electro-Dynamic-Theory-of-Life-H.S.-Burr-and-F.S.C.-Northrop.pdf&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>You can see how it precedes Michael Levin and Neri Oxman’s bio-electrical research. What bubbled up were ideas about how ideas of environmental templating would be informed by the installation of cybernetic outside-in robots. I thought about life being remade as a digitally manipulated psychodrama structured with game mechanics to create a puzzle / problem solving collective in non-linear time. I revisited previous lines of study, including Edward Dewey’s Foundation for the Study of Cycles and Julius Stulman, Fritz Kunz, and Oliver Reiser’s “Foundation for Integrated Education” and “World Institute.” By the evening I had pulled out Barbara Dewey’s book on Laminated Spacetime and queued up the movie “Arrival.” I’d meant to see it for some time, but that day all the stars aligned. Today is my dad’s birthday, and it is a month since his death. As everything came into focus for me, I felt like he was right there with me in this liminal space. I love you dad.</p>
<p>After bombarding the inboxes of a few close associates with way too many emails, I decided to pull together my thoughts in an off-the-cuff presentation. I didn’t have time to make a super fancy map with lots of supporting material. Instead I just spoke from the heart. These are the two main ideas I wanted to convey. I’m not saying they are right, but only that it’s worth looking at them hypothetically as thought experiments to see how they hold up in the context of cybernetic impact finance, bio-digital convergence, radiation hormesis, and collective consciousness management.</p>
<p>Thought experiment one:</p>
<p>Consider the internet (and soon extended reality) as a portal into the equivalent of Battle School in Ender’s Game where cooperative infinite games are substituted for finite competitive games. Nested brackets of teams engage in problem solving under conditions of real time sensing, programmed stress, and dynamic constraints. Gameplay is situated in live action role play to tap into the collective subconscious. Picture participants compensated with UBI or crypto play to earn micropayments for their in-game contributions tracked on blockchain mindfile ledgers. The interspecies / inter-intelligence communication medium in this problem-solving space could be Web3 tokens with embedded, nested narratives (think Chinese characters ala Leibniz’s aspirations for the Characteristic Universalis or sigils). Perhaps aspects of the digital stories would be unlocked and presented via holograms (think Princess Leia’s distress message for Obi Wan Kenobi). Exchange of tokens through the ritual game play of votes, trades, media engagement, and biometric and cognitive data could result in computational solutions grounded in real truths of human emotion, culture, and soulful imagination. Could Web3 tokens be a long-sought computational language bringing together the social and physical sciences?</p>
<p>Thought experiment two:</p>
<p>Could this collective cooperative “Battle School” problem space be a digital petri dish for a mass anthropological experiment where ubiquitous sensing charts lived behaviors on planet Earth in order to develop a new interspecies language? Perhaps there is something beyond this dimension, time scale, or sensing framework that really wants to communicate with life here, but it hasn’t yet found the key. What if Fourth Industrial Revolution mass surveillance, natural language processing, the shift to platform life, digital therapeutics, and human weather forecasting are being used to build mental models for linguistic analysis? As we perform our humanity in alignment with the UN Sustainable Development Goals, is there a biofilm colony keeping track and working to devleop a computational system of sociology that can bridge across our mental models of the cosmos? If so, I wonder to what end? If Barbara Dewey is correct about mind creating matter from the endosphere, installing a coordinating infrastructure (decentralized ledgers and tokens) for mass mind coordination could be leveraged to manifest unimagined realities. I don’t think we are prepared for what the chaos magician posse has in store for us with their foxy Ethereum Consensys program.</p>

  I gave a talk at PGCon this year on a privacy-first data storage service I designed and implemented. Perhaps the encryption and searching patterns will inspire others.

<div class='wrap'>

 
         
<p>Over the last year, I designed and implemented a simple web service, code-named
“CipherDoc”, that provides a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete" title="Wikipedia: “Create, read, update, and delete”">CRUD</a> API for creating, updating, searching, and
deleting <a href="https://json.org" title="ECMA-404 The JSON Data Interchange Standard">JSON</a> documents. The app enforces document structure via <a href="https://json-schema.org" title="JSON Schema is a declarative language that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents">JSON
schema</a>, while <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/datatype-json.html#DATATYPE-JSONPATH" title="PostgreSQL Docs: jsonpath Type">JSON/SQL Path</a> powers the search API by querying a hashed subset
of the schema stored in a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/gin.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: GIN Indexes">GIN-indexed</a> <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-json.html" title="PostgresSQL Docs: JSON Types">JSONB</a> column in <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/" title="PostgreSQL: The World's Most Advanced Open Source Relational Database">Postgres</a>.</p>
<p>In may I gave a public presentation on the design and implementation of the
service at <a href="https://www.pgcon.org/" title="PGCon - PostgreSQL Conference for Users and Developers">PGCon</a>: CipherDoc: A Searchable, Encrypted JSON Document Service on
Postgres. Links:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.pgcon.org/events/pgcon_2023/schedule/session/360-a-pattern-for-a-searchable-encrypted-json-document-service/" title="PGCon 2023 — CipherDoc: A Searchable, Encrypted JSON Document Service on Postgres">Description</a> 
 <a href="https://www.pgcon.org/events/pgcon_2023/sessions/session/360/slides/73/cipher-doc.pdf">Slides</a> 
 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUyHnjpr-0Q" title="CipherDoc: A Pattern for a Searchable, Encrypted JSON Document Service: David E Wheeler - PGCon 2023">Video</a> 
 
<p>I enjoyed designing this service. The ability to dynamically change the JSON
schema at runtime without database changes enables more agile development cycles
for busy teams. Its data privacy features required a level of intellectual
challenge and raw problem-solving (a.k.a., engineering) that challenge and
invigorate me.</p>
<p>Two minor updates since May:</p>
 
 I re-implemented the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/datatype-json.html#DATATYPE-JSONPATH" title="PostgreSQL Docs: jsonpath Type">JSON/SQL Path</a> parser using the original Postgres
<a href="https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/REL_15_4/src/backend/utils/adt/jsonpath_gram.y" title="jsonpath_gram.y: Grammar definitions for jsonpath datatype">path grammar</a> and <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goyacc" title="Goyacc is a version of yacc for Go. It is written in Go and generates parsers written in Go">goyacc</a>, replacing the hand-written parser roundly
castigated in the presentation. 
 The service has yet to be open-sourced, but I remain optimistic, and
continue to work with leadership at The Times towards an open-source
policy to enable its release.

The Follower/Following editing is only in pop-up javascript dialogs on your <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/?ui=2&amp;shva=1#buzz">Buzz in gmail</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/profiles/me">Google Profile</a> pages, and because of the auto-follow onboarding, rather opaque. The groups editing is in <a href="http://">Google Contacts</a>, but that doesn't show the Followers, Following, Chat Friends, Latitude or other subgroups. There is also no way to see just conversations with those groups.</p><p>The overall effect makes it feel more like a <a href="http://kevan.org/morningtonia.pl?MC_On_The_Net">Mornington Crescent server</a> than Twitter. I made a <a href="http://">Mornington Crescent</a> Buzz account; it seems to fit.</p> Publics <p>Twitter's natural view is different for each of us, and is of those we have chosen. We each have our own public that we see and we address. </p><p>The subtlety is that the <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2008/04/digital-publics-conversations-and.html">publics</a> are semi-overlapping - not everyone we can see will hear us, as they don't necessarily follow us, and they may not dip into the stream in time to catch the evanescent ripples in the flow that our remark started. To see responses to us from those we don't follow, we have to click the Mentions tab. However, as our view is of those we choose to follow, our emotional response is set by that, and we behave more civilly in return.</p><p>Buzz reverses this. The general comments from friends are in the Buzz tab, but anyone can use '@' to mention you, forcing the whole conversational thread into your inbox. Similarly, if you comment on someone else's Buzz, any further updates to the web show up in your main email inbox. The <a href="http://many.corante.com/archives/2004/11/06/the_tragedy_of_the_comments.php">tragedy of the comments</a> ensues, where <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/conferences/blog/2006/07/oscon_how_open_source_projects.html">annoying people</a> can take over the discussion, and their replies are privileged twice over those you choose to follow.</p><p>This is the <a href="http://xkcd.com/202/">YouTube comments problem</a> yet magnified; when all hear the words of one, the conversation often decays.</p> Mutual media <p>By bringing in Twitter,blogs, Google Reader shared items, photos and other Activity Streams feeds, Buzz has the potential to be a way to connect the loosely coupled flows those of us who live in the <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2010/02/09/Information-Aristocracy">listening Web</a> to the email dwellers who may left behind. By each reading whom we choose to and passing on some of it to others, we are each others media, we are the synapses in the global brain of the web of thought and conversation. Although we each only touch a local part of it, ideas can travel a long way.</p><p>If the prioritisation of secondary commentary and poking over collated ideas can be reversed in Buzz, this could be made to work.</p> Small world networks <p>Social connections are a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Six-Degrees-Science-Connected-Market/dp/0393325423%3FSubscriptionId%3D1K3HRANMNP9TFHJC9282%26tag%3Depeusepigone-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0393325423">small-world network</a> locally strongly-connected, but spreading globally in a small number of jumps. The email graph that Buzz taps into may be a worse <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2005/11/29/attention_netwo.html">model</a> of real world social networks that articulated SNS's like Facebook, but it could be improved if the following and editing models are fixed.</p><p>Buzz's promise is that it builds on <a href="http://activitystrea.ms/">Activity Streams</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/buzz/dclinton/XxER6oP4WGe/The-best-way-to-get-a-sense-of-where-the-Buzz-API">other open standards</a>, so it could help encourage others to do this better.</p>

  <p>In an <a href="https://herestomwiththeweather.com/2023/01/08/correction-check_webfinger/">earlier post</a> this year, I documented a problem I found and this post attempts to describe the issue a little more clearly and a plan to work around it.</p>

<p>I have chosen <a href="https://herestomwiththeweather.com/.well-known/webfinger/?acct=tom@herestomwiththeweather.com">@tom@herestomwiththeweather.com</a> as my personal identifier on the fediverse.  If I decide I want to move from one activitypub server (e.g. Mastodon) to another, I would like to keep my same personal identifier.  It follows that my activitypub server should not have to reside at the same domain as my personal identifier.  I should be able to swap one activitypub server for another at any time.  Certainly, I don’t expect every activitypub server to support this but I’m not obligated to use one that does not.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, although my domain returns the chosen personal identifier in the subject field, because the JRD document returns a rel=self link to <a href="https://mastodon.social/users/herestomwiththeweather">a Mastodon server</a> to provide my <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#actor-objects">actor document</a>, the mastodon servers do not seem to use my chosen personal identifier for anything other than resolving a search for my personal identifier to the mastodon profile to which it is currently associated.  From that point forward, a completely new personal identifier with the domain component set to the domain of the mastodon server is used.  In other words, a personal identifier that has been chosen for me by someone else is kept in a particular server’s database table.  I can later choose a different activitypub server but I may not be able to keep my preferred username because it may already be taken on the new server.  In any case, choosing a new server means my personal identifier within the mastodon network also changes.  Unless…I don’t use a mastodon server in the first place.  Then, my personal identifier will be used as I would like by the mastodon network and I can potentially swap activitypub servers without ever having to change my personal identifier with my own domain.</p>

<p>The two most relevant documents for understanding webfinger as it is currently used seem to be <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7033">RFC 7033: WebFinger</a> and <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/spec/webfinger/">Mastodon’s documentation</a> and it is this mastodon documentation (in the section <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/spec/webfinger/#mastodons-requirements-for-webfinger">Mastodon’s requirements for WebFinger</a>) that now describes the behavior (a problem for me) that I documented earlier.  The new section explains</p>

  <code>if the subject contains a different canonical account URI, then Mastodon will perform an additional Webfinger request for that canonical account URI in order to ensure that this new resource links to the same ActivityPub actor with the same criteria being checked.
</code> 
 

<p>This behavior makes sense if you assume that if you are using a mastodon server, then you inherit a personal identifier tied to that server.  This makes validating a webfinger address simple for mastodon so advocating a change in this behavior in mastodon seems like it would be challenging.  However, as I mentioned in the earlier post, instead of choosing mastodon as your activitypub server, your personal identifier with your own domain can be accepted by mastodon servers in a desirable way</p>

  <code>as long as the fediverse node providing the actor document is smart enough to provide your personal domain in the subject when mastodon makes a webfinger call to it.
</code> 
 

<p>The problem here is that it seems that I would not be able to be “tom” on such an activitypub server if, for instance, tom@example.com was already pointing to that server unless the server could assign me a subdomain, for example.</p>

  I've been invited to be on a few more podcasts to talk about my new book Learning Digital Identity from O'Reilly Media. That's one of the perks of writing a book. People like to talk about it. I always enjoy talking about identity and especially how it's so vital to the quality of our lives in the digital world, so I'm grateful these groups found time to speak with me.

We had a fun discussion about the definition of identity, administrative and autonomic identity systems, and SSI wallets.</p><p>I hope you enjoy these.

<p>来る9月28日に、OIX主催の IdentityTrust Conference 2023 でキーノートをします。</p>



<p>タイトルは「The Fallacy of Decentralisation」です。もしロンドンにいらしたらぜひお立ち寄りください。なお、わたしの直後のセッションは、科学・イノベーション・技術省のポール・スカリー政務次官です。また、午後には「ウォレットとフレームワーク」という座談会に出演します。</p>



 このカンファレンスについて 



<p>デジタル・クレデンシャルは、信頼できるスマート・ウォレットを介して信頼できるユーザから提供されるため、オンラインでも対面でも、ビジネスのやり方を変えることができます。</p>



<p>Identity Trust 2023 には、デジタル・クレデンシャルの受領者<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/09/5403/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-5403" title="acceptor">1</a>と、デジタル ID エコシステム内でサービ スを作成および提供する関係者が世界中から集まります。</p>



<p>この会議では、ユーザーのデジタル ID ウォレットからクレデンシャルを信頼と信用をもって受け入れることができる理由を探ります。そのユーザーは本人ですか？サービスにアクセスする資格はありますか？</p>



<p>年齢確認、金融機関へのアクセス、住宅売買、旅行、雇用審査などの主要なユースケースにおいて、デジタル ID がどのように普及しているかを探ります。</p>



<p>また、デジタルIDが国境を越えてどのように機能するかについても詳しく見ていきます。ある国を訪問する場合でも、リモートでサービスにアクセスする場合でも、「スマート・ウォレット」は、ユーザーがやり取りしたい相手ごとのアクセプターの要件に動的に適応する必要があります。</p>



<p>300人を超える参加者とともに、デジタルIDの利用がどのように加速しているか、また、それが貴社と貴社の顧客にどのような利益をもたらすかをご確認ください。</p>



<p>直接参加できない場合は、このイベントのメインステージセッションをライブストリーミングでご覧いただけます。</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>This morning I received a response to my latest blog post, a piece I’d written about grief and family separation and controlled consciousness along with a description of site visits I did in Durham, NC related to military gaming simulations, neuroscience, and psychical research. It was sent by someone I know from my education activism days, an individual who’s done important work exposing the toxic discipline and financial schemes behind a particular no-excuses charter school franchise. I won’t quote from the email because the comments weren’t shared publicly. I do, however, want to unpack the content in broad strokes.</p>
<p>I’ll admit to being triggered by that email landing in my inbox. Blaring out from the page, at least that’s how it felt to me, was the sentiment – you are a talented person Alison, but you are not humble, and that’s a problem. I quickly started drafting a response. If I’m being perfectly honest, my reply was defensive and would probably only have served to reinforce the writer’s mental picture of me as a combative, hard-headed know-it-all. Upon reflection, I sensed the sender of the email, also a blogger, likely found my post equally triggering since it critiqued academia, the prevailing climate narrative, and political polarity. All three are topics about which the author holds strong opinions. So, I paused and made a hearty breakfast of poached eggs and crispy kale with a side of thick bacon slices, and then after finishing off a Moka pot, I decided to write my reply here instead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The email sent to me opened with the lyrics from Grace Slick and The Great Society’s song “Someone to Love,” which was later re-recorded at “Somebody to Love.”&nbsp; According to Wikipedia, the group originally performed the song at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Society_(band)">The Matrix nightclub</a> in San Francisco in 1965-66. For me this has synergy with my ongoing interest in Madeline L’Engle’s “Wrinkle In Time” novel, which centers love as the only thing that can overcome IT, the mechanical ruler of the dead world of Camazotz. The song lyrics speak of truth turning into lies, joy and garden flowers dying, and a mind full of red. The answer is to find “somebody to love,” which given the nature of the personal rejection I’m navigating by the people I love is rather cutting.</p>
<p>As I interpreted the intent of the email, which is in itself a fraught enterprise, the implication seems to be that I had turned into an angry and joyless person. People who read my work or listen to my talks know that is not the case. Sure, the past few weeks have been terrible, not just because my father died – I had mostly come to terms with that. The worst part was dealing with the finality of being cast out by my living family and the deep woundedness I felt at that cold, clinical distancing.</p>
<p>This week I was able to mostly push my anger aside, because I continue to hope that the answer is love – that love will win in the end. The message being implanted in the minds of many today is that dissidents are dark, bitter people – people who can neither be trusted nor understood with minds full of “red” thoughts. In that way we can be dehumanized, marginalized. You don’t have to pay attention to bitter people. It gives you a pass.</p>
<p>Below is what I wrote in my unsent, draft response.</p>
<p>“I want to make it clear that I am not enraged. That is what the media juggernaut would have you believe. The masses are inhabiting narratives that have been strategically fed to them for years, decades even, by sophisticated digital content management systems. These systems have been set up to reinforce social segmentation, divisiveness, and teaming. Consumption of programmed information threatens to turn us into the human equivalent of social insects. Complexity and emergence leverage automated reactivity and pre-programmed social cues. The system is using playlists of content to manage entire populations, to trigger specific biochemical reactions. I sense we’re in a simulation that is being remotely guided by hormone manipulation and biochemical signaling. See this four-minute clip about neuro-economics and use of oxytocin to induce (or remove) social trust by Elizabeth Phelps of Harvard and Paul Glimcher, a neuro-economist from UPenn.</p>
<p></p>
<p>By making your critique about some aspect of my personality, you get to sidestep the content I’ve meticulously gathered on the ethical implications of guided consciousness, biosensors, game mechanics, and group mind. Please know, I’ve mostly made peace with my situation. I plan to find a little house in the forests and lakes of the Ozarks, put up a deer fence, make a garden, get a kayak, and reconnect with nature. I’ll quilt and maybe learn how to fish. I hear the White River offers amazing trout habitat. At the top of my list for now is the little town of Mountain View, Arkansas a center for the preservation of folk music, craft, and heirloom plants. I sense we all are instruments of the divine, energetic beings, members of life’s symphony. The byline of a Twitter handle of an online friend, a musician, is “I am a string.” A string yes, and who or what are we allowing to play us? As I see it now, the military-finance-big pharma psychiatric machine is working overtime to shove God off the conductor’s podium and install the Web3 layer of mathematical logic. I’m not going to stop my work, but I am going to change the context in which I pursue it.</p>
<p>As far as “The Great Society,” I understand it differently now. If you haven’t seen my site visit to the LBJ Presidential Library and School of Public Policy in Austin, it might be of interest.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I recognize that Elizabeth Hinton’s book, “<a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/697897/summary">From the War on Poverty to the War on Crime</a>,” even in its critique, was setting up social impact finance and ultimately cybernetic signaling. She’s an agent of Harvard after all. Still, the history she lays out was super helpful to me as I started making sense of the ways socio-technical systems intersect with Skinnerian behavior modification and optimization metrics.”</p>
<p>I looked up the definition of humility to revisit what “humble” traits are: recognizing your own limitations, not thinking you are better than others, showing gratitude for team members, learning from those around you, and understanding your imperfections. Now, I would assert that I do have gratitude for those around me. We learn from one another even though our community is small in number. Many of the leads I pursue are shared with me by others. I may not always acknowledge that as loudly as I probably should, so let me do that now. Thank you all. I see you and appreciate you even if I don’t always say it.</p>
<p>I sense that by putting myself out publicly and framing my research through a lens of personal experience, some might imagine me to have a big ego. Egocentrism is the inability to recognize the needs of others or act with empathy. Egocentric people place their personal needs above those of others. What I’m struggling with is my feeling that I have been called to carry out a particular task at a particular time. Does this make me egocentric?</p>
<p>Should I set aside this calling and instead listen to people who are living out a totally different storyline that incorporates none of the cataclysmic changes now underway? Am I supposed to empathize with the wife of the guy managing multibillion-dollar investment portfolios that will run on ubiquitous sensing and derivatives markets in human behavior change? I can try and relate to her situation, but don’t expect me to bite my tongue and pretend I don’t have a problem with how all of this greenwashing is unfolding.</p>
<p>Maybe my single-minded enthusiasm for the topics I research is seen by others as boorish, impolite, and aggravating. Most people do not wish to have their ideas about civilization questioned. I get it. I have some degree of sympathy for their plight, but it doesn’t mean the things we talk about aren’t happening, aren’t relevant. Why can’t I just go along quietly and stop making the people around me so uncomfortable – especially since I don’t have a handy solution ready to pull out of my back pocket. Civil society including educational institutions, religious groups, and political parties, have been set up instruct us on how to be “good” within the confines of the game board that we call “civilized” life today. There are informal rubrics of socially-acceptable behaviors to which they imagine I must be oblivious. Is disciplined silence the key to being a “good” person in this stupid game? It feels like bullshit to me.</p>
<p>The pronouncement that I was not humble (or that I was proud / overbearing) felt like someone patting me on the head like a good little girl and sending me off to bed while the grown-ups took care of business. Who am I to presume I might be able to help shift the course of social evolution away from the cybernetic gangplank? I’m just a mom after all. Be humble Ally; stay in the background; think whatever you like; but don’t rock the boat in public. It’s unseemly. My husband recently told me, you don’t understand your effect on people. I should have asked, which people? People are not a homogenous monolith, at least not yet.</p>
<p>My family feels burdened by me. I think they imagine I have an over-inflated sense of self-worth. Though if they loved me unconditionally, they’d probably give me a big hug and be proud to be connected to a strong, grounded woman who is confident in her abilities and has a solid moral compass. I think I have a unique mind. I certainly don’t consider myself “better,” just “different.” I’m okay with being different. Each of us has God-given gifts, and I’m trying to use mine to advance right relationships. Since no one gave me an operating manual, and I only have a rough idea of what the end goal might look like, I’m learning and stumbling and recalibrating as I go along. I’ve chosen to do it out in the open to show that we can be fragile, creative, messy, and perhaps imperfectly perfect.</p>
<p>It is my strongly held feeling that we all have an obligation to talk about, grapple with, and come to terms with aspects of technological “progress” that are coming online right now before our eyes. While personally I believe many of these developments are unnatural and profane; I will not insist others agree with me. I will, however, continue to press for public conversations and informed consent. God has put this on my heart and given me resources to fulfill that responsibility. Who am I to turn my back on such an assignment?</p>
<p>It requires a healthy ego and sense of self-worth to pour out one’s personal pain onto the page for all to see. Quite a few comments on my recent posts, indicate to me that unpacking my present anguish is helping others navigate their way through the dark night of the soul. I know my audience is a niche one. I left social media and realized what drove me was a quest for internal clarity about the nature of the world and how history has informed the digitally-mediated social communications (or more likely mis-communications) of today.</p>
<p>I’ve chosen to conduct my research by sharing it on the internet, in the digital commons, a place I’ve come to understand is treacherous and full of landmines. I pulled back on my participation in these algorithmically-engineered spaces a few years ago when I began to have negative, dramatic interactions with people online. The weaponized nature of these platforms sank into my bones with deep finality. While I still share observations on my blog and video channel, I’m not actively looking to convert people to my way of thinking. I don’t do interviews with people I don’t know anymore. I’m not aiming to lead anyone anywhere. I just want to stay over in my corner, thinking my own thoughts and playing with ideas rather than wading out into the storm to be buffeted by digital tempests. That’s such a time suck, and I have other things I’d rather be doing.</p>
<p>This person’s email expressed the view that I sought to educate through intimidation and disparaged those who couldn’t understand my perspective. I recognize from the work of Cliff Gomes, that such sentiments have less to do with who I am, than the story the author of the email was listening to. It is easier to imagine me as a mean-spirited critic than consider they might not really want to know what I’ve been up to, because then they would be faced with the challenge of fitting it into a worldview where it just doesn’t fit. Jason has had similar things said to him. I suppose that confronting people with information that might undermine the vision of the world they hold at the core of their being could be seen as intimidating. Maybe that’s why people keep running away.</p>
<p>Our intention isn’t to be threatening. The tools of my trade, beyond relationship maps and hyperlinks to primary source documents, are flowers and rocks and even Bible passages. Is a sunflower laid down at an office park intimidating? I feel called to be a witness to the changes underway – to ask, insistently sometimes, for us to act responsibly lest we fall victim to a terrible Faustian bargain. I’m trying to be voice of the firm parent to a child in a tantrum. Children find parents intimidating, but it doesn’t mean they don’t learn from them.</p>
<p>The email also implied I wanted to be everything and know everything, which is odd, because in the post I specifically mention I’ve come to realize no one can ever hold the entire “truth.” All we get are the slices of “reality” we curate from the information we bump into as we live our lives. What did resonate with me though was a line about the importance of boundaries in systems and that making distinctions is a vital cognitive act, which is an idea I’ve been exploring related to complexity and emergence.</p>
<p>The body works to distinguish good from bad, encapsulating and removing the latter to preserve life. Computational fitness landscapes and genetic algorithms are based on this process. If the goal of “civilization” is to merge natural life with engineered nano-machines and birth a global, distributed, noetic, biohybrid supercomputing system, it’s logical that polite society would shun anyone seeking to slow progress towards that goal.</p>
<p>As I’ve tried to explain to my husband numerous times, we seem to be occupying different slices of reality. It doesn’t mean one of us is wrong and one of us is right. We could both be right and still different. Each person curates the world they inhabit. Our conceptual immune systems are set up to minimize cognitive discomfort. Boundaries contain us. Boundaries organize our identities. Boundaries tell us who is in and who is out. In the slow boil that is the Web3 digital identity and social steering, there are few incentives to think deeply and work to tear down manufactured boundaries that may be obscuring deeper understandings of the world we inhabit. I get it. I can empathize. That’s frightening to most people; boundaries make us feel safe.</p>
<p>There are no easy answers. The game mechanics have been structured so that we remain distracted as we get leveled up or cancelled on social leaderboards. For now, I’m choosing to view my cancellation as a back-handed blessing. Jason and I have a camping trip planned for October to explore Arkansas and see what there is to be seen – quartz, oaks, pine, bass, lakes, and streams. Maybe I’ll find a place where flowers will grow, joy is the norm, and the people I love will come find me there. For everyone I wish that you, too, can find a place to plant yourself, a place that brings you the personal satisfaction you desire and lets you develop into the person you were meant to be. For me, it’s time for reinvention, fingers crossed. Take the good parts, leave those which are no longer serving me, and uncover new dimensions in the human constellation that is Ally.</p>

 <p></p>Mothwing patterns, often including structures resembling “owl eyes,” are a prime example of nature’s adaptation to survival.<p>Mothwing eyes are intricate patterns that have evolved over millions of years through a process of natural selection. Initially, moths developed cryptic colouration to blend into their environments, evading predators. Over time, some species developed wing scales with microstructures that reduced light reflection, helping them remain inconspicuous. These structures eventually evolved into complex arrays resembling the texture of eyes to deter predators, a phenomenon called “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyespot_(mimicry)">eyespot mimicry</a>.” This natural error-creation adaptation likely startled or confused predators, offering those moths an advantage — precious moments to escape. The gradual development of these eye-like patterns underscores the intricate interplay between environmental pressures and biological responses, resulting in the remarkable diversity of moth wing patterns seen today.</p><p>Critically, moths are not and were not conscious in or of the development of eyespot mimicry or any other evolutionary adaptations. They did not think, “Let us moths create a pattern on the wing to confuse the owl.” Evolution is a gradual, unconscious process that occurs over generations through the mechanism of natural selection. Individual organisms do not consciously choose or design their adaptations; rather, random genetic mutations lead to variations in traits within a population. Suppose a particular trait, such as the “eyes” pattern on wings, provides some advantage in terms of survival or reproduction. In that case, individuals possessing that trait are more likely to pass on their genes to the next generation. Over time, these advantageous traits become more prevalent in the population.&nbsp;This process occurs without the organisms having any conscious intent or awareness of the changes in their traits. It results from environmental pressures and the differential survival and reproduction of individuals with different traits.</p><blockquote><p>AI can develop new traits with advantages, but that does not make it conscious.</p></blockquote><p>AI (as of 2023) does not possess consciousness or intent like humans. However, consciousness and the development of new survival traits are unrelated. Indeed, neither is the characteristic of “independent decision-making” linked to survival. Adaption, evolution and the crafting of new advantage does not have any links to higher-order thinking or awareness.</p><p>AI operates based on algorithms, data, and programming, and any development of new traits or capabilities at the start (where we are today) will be a direct result of deliberate human design and engineering rather than unconscious adaptation.</p><p>Whilst simple algorithms can simulate processes that resemble aspects of evolution, such as genetic algorithms and neural architecture search, to optimise certain parameters or designs. Whereas&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo">AlphaGo</a>&nbsp;(Google Deepmind) demonstrated the ability to learn and improve its gameplay through a combination of deep neural networks and reinforcement learning techniques based on data.&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaZero">AlphaZero</a>&nbsp;went further insomuch that it doesn’t even need a data set to start as it is generated through selfplay.</p> What is happening here? <p>AlphaGo &amp; AlphaZero demonstrated that processes guided by predefined objectives and criteria set by human programmers or researchers have enabled new traits (moves) to be crafted. These “AI” implementations do not have self-awareness or independent decision-making ability, but that does not prevent the autonomous development of new traits or adaptations in the same way living organisms do through evolution. AlphaGo’s capabilities are still within the bounds of its programmed algorithms and training data. It doesn’t possess a consciousness and is a product of human engineering, designed to excel at a specific task, but as with AlphaZero and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaFold">AlphaFold</a>, such systems can create new traits and advantages.</p><p>Whilst AI systems such as AlphaGo/ AlphaFold showcase the power of AI to adapt and improve within predefined parameters, it highlights that we are on the cusp of AI developing traits or adapting in the same way living organisms do through evolution.</p><blockquote><p>We are on the cusp of AI developing traits or adapting in the same way living organisms do through evolution.</p></blockquote><p>We should not be surprised as these AI systems are trying to mimic how humans and living organisms learn and evolve; therefore, a natural consequence is evolution, the development of traits based on “<a href="https://opengovernance.net/why-finding-purpose-feels-impossible-d5c92eb1bde3">errors</a>” that provide an advantage.</p><p>There is a very fine line between AI systems operating under the guidance of human-defined objectives and constraints and such systems creating errors and adaptations, essentially improvements based on patterns learned from data, just like nature. The observation becomes interesting as data can now be created independently of human activity using&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-play">selfplay</a>.</p><p>The development of new traits or improvements in AI based on “<a href="https://opengovernance.net/why-finding-purpose-feels-impossible-d5c92eb1bde3">errors</a>” in data will soon mimic the unconscious forces of natural selection, which we will only see once it has been created.&nbsp;Critically, we have to question “how will we know” because it is new and different.&nbsp;This question is one that regulation is not set up to address or can solve, and it is why regulating the AI industry makes no sense.</p><blockquote><p>The development of new traits or improvements in AI based on “<a href="https://opengovernance.net/why-finding-purpose-feels-impossible-d5c92eb1bde3">errors</a>” in data will soon mimic the unconscious forces of natural selection, which we will only see once it has been created.</p></blockquote> Questions for the directors and senior leadership team. <p>We are fully into automation and the implementation of AI across many of our systems, and indeed, we are using the data to make improvements that we did not see. Have you questioned if this new trait has an advantage, and how have you determined it has an advantage and for whom? Is the advantage for you, your ecosystem, your customer or your AI?</p><p>Thank you&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-david-35a5887/">Scott</a>&nbsp;for seeding this.</p>

   <br><p>The (un)intended consequence of focusing on data, looking for significance, determining correlation, testing a hypothesis, removing bias and finding the consensus is that you ignore the outliers.&nbsp;</p><p>Hidden in the outliers of data are progress, innovation, invention and creativity, and the delay is that by ignoring this data and the signals from it, we slow down everything because we will always be late to observe and agree on what is already happening with those who are not driven by using data to reduce and manage today's risk.&nbsp; Our thrust to use data to make better decisions and apply majority or consensus thinking creates delays in change and, therefore, increases future risk.&nbsp;</p><br><p>------</p><p>In our increasingly data-driven world, the unintended consequence of data often manifests as delay. While data is hailed as the lifeblood of decision-making, its sheer volume and complexity can paradoxically slow down processes, hinder innovation, and impede productivity. This phenomenon underscores the critical importance of managing data effectively to avoid unintended delays.</p><p>One primary way data leads to delay is through information overload. As organisations accumulate vast amounts of data, sorting through it can be overwhelming. Decision-makers may spend excessive time sifting through data, distinguishing relevant insights from the noise. This can result in analysis paralysis, where decisions are postponed indefinitely and opportunities are missed.</p><p>Data can also introduce delays when it is siloed within organisations. Departments may collect and store data independently, leading to fragmentation and redundancy. When data is not easily accessible across the organisation, collaboration suffers, and decision-making processes become fragmented. This can slow down projects and hinder the ability to respond swiftly to changing market conditions.</p><p>Moreover, the increasing focus on data privacy and security regulations has introduced a layer of complexity and delay. Organisations must navigate a labyrinth of compliance requirements, which can slow down data sharing and processing. The need for stringent data protection measures can sometimes clash with the need for agility and speed in decision-making.</p><p>The unintended delay caused by data can be mitigated through effective data management strategies. Investing in data analytics tools and platforms that can streamline data processing and analysis is crucial. Fostering a data-centric culture that encourages data sharing and collaboration can help break down organisational silos.</p><p>In conclusion, data is a powerful asset but can also be a source of unintended delay if not managed properly. Organisations must recognise the potential pitfalls of data overload, fragmentation, and compliance challenges and take proactive steps to mitigate these issues. With the right strategies and tools in place, data can be a catalyst for informed decision-making and innovation rather than a source of delay.</p><br><br><br>

<p>What follows is a day-long outpouring of emotion. I’ve been back in Philadelphia for five days, and it felt like the right time to begin to process and document the past two weeks, the synchronicities and the heartache, before the memories fade into oblivion. My gut tells me these experiences hold life lessons, especially the passages chosen by the pastor for my father’s life celebration. Even if I can’t see them all right away, they will be there when I’m ready. I sense that it’s important to not lose track of these teachings, and perhaps by putting words to my emotions I will gradually be able to make sense of the chaos that surrounds my life at present.</p>
<p>I glanced over at the passenger seat and saw a chunky green inchworm waggling its front end through the air trying to figure out where it was. Certainly the cracked leather seat of an aging Subaru wasn’t its proper habitat. We were on NC Route 27 nearing Albemarle and the piney Uwharrie National Forest in the center part of the state. It must have joined the trip when I got off I-485 around Charlotte and pulled over to harvest some mimosa leaves and pods from the side of the road.</p>
<p>One of my fondest memories as a small child was of the hedged backyard behind the modest Fort Worth ranch house where I spent the first few years of my life. My dad, who died on September 1, had made me a wonderful sandbox around the base of a mimosa tree, a magical tree for a child with its fan-shaped pink flowers. I loved the doodle bugs / ant lions that lived in my sandbox. I loved the purple iris along the garage wall; blooms my mother wrapped in damp paper towels and crumpled aluminum foil for me to take to my preschool teachers. I loved the monarch butterflies that paused on the bushes around our patio on their ambitious trips up from Mexico and the tiger lilies along the back fence that shared the same shade of burnt orange. Our gardenia bushes were surrounded by some sort of volcanic stone “mulch” that must have been all the rage in the early 1970s. I remembered their sweet scent when years later I chose them for my wedding flowers, a wrist corsage saved for decades in an archival box under the bed with my classic cotton lace Laura Ashley dress. The shriveled corsage I tossed in the trash as the big clean-up of Ally’s life continues. The dress I cut up to be remade into a quilt someday. Little Ally’s world inside that backyard hedge was a natural wonder, small in scale but magnificent to nurture a child’s imagination. At this point in my life I am hoping to get back to that place where I was when I was four, a place of quiet gratitude. After spending my adulthood in the big city, now a smart city, I’m trying to figure out where I really belong.</p>
<p>I was heading north, up I-95. I couldn’t say I was going “home” really, because I don’t have a “home” at the moment. Yes, I have shelter until we put our row house on the market in the spring. But “home is where the heart is,” right? Presently, my heart is full of holes with ragged gaps that were once filled with love – maybe not the brilliantly burning love of youth, but the mature type of love, a steady bank of glowing embers. My father’s passing brought the reality of my situation into painful focus. I can no longer hold onto naive ideas about keeping the home fires burning in anticipation of a time when the three of us could remake ourselves into some new kind of family or even that my mother holds unconditional love for me. No, everything seems conditional now, contingent on proof of cognitive compliance. Their cancellation of me has been cemented into their own identities. The people who were once closest to me now exist in direct opposition to the person they imagine I’ve become. There is no way to dissuade them, to show them that I really am me, the same me I’ve always been. I realize the framing they’ve embraced since the lockdowns cannot shift without destabilizing the shaky narrative they’ve chosen to inhabit. I am the problem. I have to be the problem in order for their reality to remain steady.</p>
<p>Arriving in my fifties at a vantage point where I’ve begun to see the game of life for what it is, made me unlovable. No one will tell me what my unforgivable sins are other than I have high moral expectations, apparently spend too much time on my research (as opposed to say watching house flipping shows, Netflix series, or soccer games), and I hold a low opinion of Bill Gates and his foundation. Though honestly, anyone who pays attention to my work knows I moved on from Gates to Marc Andreessen, Protocol Labs, and Web3 over two years ago.</p>
<p>Is it because I no longer listen to NPR? Read the Washington Post and New York Times? Cheer for the Eagles? Subscribe to the narratives spun out on mainstream and social media – either side, progressive or conservative? Is it because I look up with concern over the streaks that crisscross our skies? Oppose compulsory public health interventions, digital identity, smart dust, and blockchained cloud minds? I lived for decades in the city of brotherly love imagining it to be a tolerant place where culture and diversity were valued. Either I was wrong or this new normal means diversity can only be tolerated if it conforms to established rubrics informed by “trustworthy,” real-time data flows.</p>
<p>The vast majority of Philadelphians cannot or will not acknowledge there is a game underway. It is a game of human computation where we’ll be expected to perform our humanity, emitting signals in a machine-readable format so artificial intelligence and quantum computers can parasitize our imaginations, emotions, and souls. Distributed layers of smart contract protocols will guide social evolution through complexity towards emergence, gleaning useful patterns and products from our collective actions and most intimate relationships.</p>
<p>I can see this shift will be sold as libertarian commoning, uniting the populist left and right in a long-planned Transpartisan campaign. I expect many will be happy to become “self-sovereign” agents in “play to earn” crypto gaming simulations. They choose not to see the infrastructure of extended-reality being installed around them or consider its origins in militarized behavioral psychology. It feels almost impossible to motivate people to start wrapping their minds around the dire implications of ubiquitous sensing technology, blockchain ledgers, and bio-digital convergence. The learning curve is steep, and not enough people have the stamina, focus, or willpower to take the deep dive. Few want to leave the cave; the shadows are captivating. My husband keeps telling me that I “left him” and that “I changed,” but I would never have intentionally left our family. I would never ask him or our child to become someone they weren’t; though, sadly, they could not do the same for me. My experience since 2019 has been that people inside the cave fear those who’ve wandered outside and come back with a new perspective. Maybe it’s trite to say this feels like Campbell’s Hero’s Journey cycle, but it does. I’m not sure if I’ve crossed the first threshold or am making my way through the road of trials. In any event, none of this is pleasant.</p>
<p>When I noticed the inchworm on the passenger seat, I was on my way to Durham, NC. I’m not up for ten-hour drives and needed an overnight stop as I made my way back north. My father had died ten days before. I was with him. It was just him and me. I held his hand my tears dampening the stubble on his cheeks as I pressed my heart against his as he made his passage. Compounding the trauma of losing him was the challenge of moving forward with the details of his life celebration as my mother undermined my efforts and my estranged child and husband emotionally complicated the proceedings. This was not a time of family togetherness and neighbors bringing casseroles – not by a long shot. A sweet silver lining was the time I spent with my sister-in-law and niece. Together, we put thoughtful touches, Kansas sunflowers, vintage photos, my father’s favorite junk foods, on his life celebration.</p>
<p>In spite of all the difficulties, I know I made my father proud, reading the eulogy I wrote for him and singing, without musical accompaniment, the lullaby he sang me when I was little. Several people told us that it was the most personal, touching service they’d ever attended and complimented my skills in writing and public speaking, asking if I did that for a living. Not as living, no, but as my calling. In the days after his passing, I used my gifts for my dad. A few people who attended even though they had never met my father said that after the service, they felt like they really knew him and what a strong, kind, faithful man he was.</p>
<p>I ordered a subdued white and green arrangement for the altar, with hydrangeas for my mother – her favorite. For the reception table I chose boldly-colored flowers, including sunflowers, a nod to my dad’s midwestern roots. As I was picking up catering trays and napkins at the party store, I realized I needed a few things from the grocery next door. There was a seasonal display at the checkout, pails of floral sunshine that seemed to have been placed there just for me. I knew bouquets of sunflowers would be a perfect addition to the event, so I grabbed three of them. My sister-in-law graciously agreed to pick up vases at the thrift store. She, my niece, and I each made a tent card to be placed on the church-lady punch and cookies tables: “Jerry Hawver, our Kansas sunflower, lit up our lives.” I was tempted to add a pumpkin to the display, because my dad used to tell us stories that he, the fourth child, was born way overdue. When he arrived on October 1, 1942, he was over nine pounds, with a complexion that was a sort of &nbsp;jaundiced yellow. People said he looked just like a pumpkin. Out of respect, and because people probably wouldn’t understand, I refrained.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I knew that in the future I would remember my dad whenever I saw sunflowers with their exuberant shade of yellow. Yesterday, I was stressed about the future and money and dealing with conflict with my husband, and as I slowed to a stop in the Chamounix part of Fairmount Park on the way to drop off more of my former life at Goodwill, I saw a single sunflower plant covered in a dozen blooms. It was all by itself along the shoulder of the road right next to the stop sign, in part shade. It was definitely not the kind of spot you’d expect to see a sunflower. We don’t have many sunflowers here in Philadelphia, and I took it as a sign. One of my mother’s contributions to the service was to request a solo by the organist, the hymn “His Eye Is On The Sparrow” popularized by Ethel Waters. The lyrics are taken from the words of David in the Psalms. God looks after the sparrows even though they neither reap nor sow; implying that of course God’s eye is on all of us as well. Seeing that sunflower reminded me of the sentiment behind the hymn, that God was looking after me in my times of trouble. I pictured my father next to him, restored and whole. I took a deep breath and calmed down. Thanks dad.</p>
<p>Driving along the back roads towards Durham, I paid special attention to the bungalows and ranch houses. They were the kind of houses my dad was raised in and the kind of starter homes he and my mother raised us in until they upgraded to the two-story corporate suburban models a Procter and Gamble salary could support. I remember how excited I was when we relocated to Louisville, KY in first grade and bought a house on a fall-away lot with a partially-finished basement that had stairs. As a child that felt like luxury! The driveway of the house on Weissinger Road sloped towards the backyard and was perfect for big-wheels races. Those years my little brother and I roamed the neighborhood playing in the not-yet-developed wood lots and stormwater ditches. I remember being fascinated by the quartz crystals in the stones that lined the banks, the crayfish you could find occasionally, and the clay deposits my friend Andrea and I would fashion into lop-sided pinch pots as we sat on a wall by her garage lined with marigolds that made for colorful potion ingredients. Those are good memories, memories I should remember to tap into for the journey ahead of me.</p>
<p>The houses I passed on Route 27 were like the houses of my maternal grandparents and great aunt – houses with chest freezers, home canned goods, big gardens irrigated by wells, kitchens filled with the smell of homemade bread toast and jewel-like gelatin squares (Knox blocks) in the fridge. My grandparents were far from perfect, but as I’m entering this new phase of my life, I’m developing a new appreciation the frugal way they lived. I’ve been prowling online real estate listings, trying to imagine my landing place, even though I know I’ll have to wait until spring when we sell our Philadelphia home. Still, I’m glad to be moving beyond house as a status symbol – keeping up with the Joneses kitchens, deluxe ensuite bathrooms, and prioritizing potential for market appreciation. I have a child who’s grown, so school districts are not a concern. As long as I can find a sturdy, modest ranch or bungalow that I can heat for a reasonable price, I’m fine with 1970s cabinets and 1940s bathroom tile. At this point, they’re practically antiques and I’m a historic preservationist. Maybe once I get settled and put a kitchen garden in, I can prove to my mother that I am worthy of stewarding the carved wooden family hay fork, brought from the Volga by my German immigrant forebears. I guess that would be coming full circle.</p>
<p>I kept looking out of the side of my eye at my unexpected guest. It wasn’t one of the tiny critters that drift down from the treetops by a slender thread, but a plump, juicy fellow about as big around as a pipe cleaner and almost an inch and a half long. It was crawling around on the bag of materials, I’d gathered to set an intention – gardenias, a mushroom, a quartz rock, some sunflowers and matching yellow card stock hearts with 1 Corinthians 16: 13-I4 written on them, encouraging us to have faith and be strong, brave, and loving. I’ll admit to having failed at the loving part that week, losing myself in anger over the abandonment I felt wash over me. I’ve mostly pulled myself together, but I know that what transpired in the aftermath of losing my father, was that I really lost (almost) all family relationships.</p>
<p>As much as I’d held onto the hope that if I was good enough, the people I thought should love me would love me. I now recognize the people whose love and companionship I desire don’t know me anymore and have no desire to know me. My mother was strangely enraged by the eulogy I wrote because it didn’t include her pain. One night she grabbed me by the shoulders, shook me, and called me a bully for writing it. Dozens of kind comments about it had already been left on my blog. The whole episode was surreal. When I tried to tell my husband what had happened, he couldn’t seem to muster much empathy. The people around me seem to want the body that holds my spirit to metamorphosize (or regress?) into another kind of person, a person who will agree to play the game, a person who never left Plato’s cave, a person who will conveniently fit into some archetypal box the media created for the masses to inhabit. I just can’t.</p>
<p>My experience has been that my presence continues to be a source of discomfort in their lives, a nagging pain that must be avoided. I can’t give them what they want, which is for me to become someone else, for me not to have evolved as a human being caught up in an era of immense changes to which the majority of people around me are oblivious. So, I’m trying to ball up the grief of losing my dad with all the other rejections that flowed after that. Maybe it will be easier to process this mass of heartache all in one go rather than let it drag out for years, poisoning me with bitterness. I should probably be grateful for the clarity the pain provides. Maybe now, with band-aids ripped off and my broken heart exposed to fresh air, I’ll be able clear the slate of the past thirty-five years and start again.</p>
<p>On the drive down I had time to reflect on my situation. I’m Jerry Hawver’s daughter. I have agency. I’m tough, but I have a heart. I deserve a life where I’m appreciated for who I am, a quirky but kind personality with unique gifts for those with ears to hear at this time of great transition. I know my dad would want me to be happy. Playing the game, especially the hyper-extended reality Web3 game that’s coming online now, is not going to bring me joy. When I left Seattle, I thought I could continue to play the role of the good ex-wife, the devoted daughter, the dutiful mother. I thought if I did all the right things, if I centered other people’s needs, I could earn my way back into their hearts. That proved not to be the case. I tried to come back and swallow my pride and agree to be an agent in the game, telling myself maybe I could gather insights while making coffee, and travel arrangements, and ordering copy paper for the kinds of programs I’ve been researching over the past decade. I applied to dozens of jobs and got a few interviews.</p>
<p>I try not to judge, because this noetic thing we’re enmeshed in is, in fact, pervasive. In my view, the system considers all Earthly beings to be nodes in a massively sophisticated biological computation machine, the ant computer. Just this week, listening to Neal Stephenson’s Baroque Cycle series, a prequel to Cryptonomicon, it dawned on me that we may be facing off against Gottfried Leibniz’s Characteristica Universalis, a language he conceptualized based on Chinese characters, the i Ching, metaphysics, and calculus. I now think that may be what lies at the core of Web3 smart contracts, human computation, digital commoning, tokenized behavior, cybernetics, complexity, game mechanics, social impact finance, and surveillance of public health and decarbonization metrics.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I am keenly aware that intuitive, imaginative thinking is a threat to such a system. People who choose not to behave according to Skinnerian programs are like nails sticking up, daring the powers that be to try and pound them down. We are sabots in the looms; we are the wrenches that threaten to break the teeth of the gears. We represent the possibility that progress towards digital manifest destiny may be slowed or even hobbled. Climate Millenarianists are working hard to brand their post-Anthropocene “ecotopias” as “green” populist endeavors rather than the corporate juggernauts they actually are. Even if they’re not visible on stage, those in the know understand the likes of Black Rock, Goldman Sachs, Raytheon, and Pfizer are peering out from the wings. The fitness landscapes of genetic algorithms have to work overtime to constantly erase principled dissent on behalf of the sacred natural world and smooth the path towards convergence. Yet still we persist and keep showing up with hearts, sunflowers, and intentions placed to divert the tidal wave of electrical engineering, EMF radiation, nano-biotech, and big data.</p>
<p>After Seattle I created a LinkedIn profile and started furiously applying for jobs. I applied to at least one a day – anything that seemed like it could be a possible match for my eclectic set of qualifications. Mostly I scouted local universities, which is where I thought I could get a decent salary with benefits. For most of my life, academic and non-profit cultural organizations were the places where I felt most comfortable. Only now, on the back end of my life, have I begun to realize institutions of higher education function as gatekeepers to confine and compartmentalize thought, quietly, but effectively, neutering critical thinking. Jeff Schmidt, a physicist, laid this out in his book “Disciplined Minds.” Acceptable knowledge is a currency guarded and traded through esoteric academic ritual. Unacceptable knowledge, knowledge that could undermine manufactured polarization and the trajectories of problem-reaction-solution campaigns, is disappeared or at least disincentivized. The shift to digital life made this erasure much easier. Simply toss inconvenient ideas into Orwell’s memory holes or brand them as “conspiracy.” If you say it often enough, it becomes reality.</p>
<p>Deep in my heart I knew that, but I was willing to try and hold onto the family home, even as everyone else abandoned ship. I did a few online interviews. One job, a museum, had a required health status. Nope. Another was for a contemporary art institution whose major donors were members of the high-finance crowd. I managed to get an in-person interview for an office manager position for the undergraduate division of Wharton, Trump’s alma mater. It felt as if the universe was pranking me. Seriously! Still, I put on my new interview outfit. The black skirt I’d ordered didn’t fit well, so I wore a tan linen one instead. That meant a change of shoes to some cute brown flats with ankle straps. I thought I’d cleaned up rather nicely. I got on the bus leaving plenty of extra time. As I stood to exit, I sensed there was something was wrong with my shoe. I paused and looked up. Another passenger pointed out that the whole front of the sole had fallen off.</p>
<p>I was dumbfounded. There was no indication that the shoes were worn out. There must have been some catastrophic failure of the synthetic substance of the sole. I grabbed the lump of latex (?) and exited wondering if there were any clothing stores nearby where I could buy a pair of shoes. A block away I found two clothing stores, but neither of them stocked shoes. The only shoe store in the vicinity the clerk told me sold running shoes, which was rather symbolic. By this time the sole was falling off the other shoe, so I just grabbed the remaining chunks and threw them in the trash. There was nothing to be done but keep going. My flats were now really FLAT. There was a bit of fabric on the bottom, and I hoped that if I kept my feet under the table no one would notice. I made my way toward the building where the interview was to be with as much dignity as I could muster.</p>
<p>It turns out that building faced the Wistar Institute, the oldest biotechnology lab in the United States and an important center for vaccine research and nanotechnology development. There was a back-to-school event happening outside the building. As I passed, I had the surreal vision of a young woman playing corn hole as music blared. In her hand she held a bean bag. She wore a t-shirt that was emblazoned with the phrase “I’m a CRISPR Engineer.” It had the ThermoFisher Scientific logo printed on the sleeve. Do you remember a decade ago when we were not only allowed to question gene-editing, but in many quarters, it was expected that educated people should oppose it? I took it all in and continued my sole-less walk into the WAR Building (Wharton Academic Research Building). I haven’t heard back from them, but it didn’t seem like a place with much joy.</p>
<p>Someone told me recently that in the Jungian sense shoes symbolize grounding. The past few years have taken away all that grounded me. While I am still in the process of mourning those losses, I hold out hope that there may be a new beginning on the horizon, far from Philadelphia. I just can’t see it yet.</p>
<p>The closing episode of my last-gasp attempt to hold onto my Philadelphia life took place this week. After uploading four video-recorded responses to an HR-tech platform, I landed an in-person meeting with Bethany Wiggin, founder of Penn’s Environmental Humanities Program. Wiggin’s academic background is German language and comparative literature. I found it interesting that she shares a last name with the fictional Ender Wiggin, protagonist of Orson Scott Card’s seemingly prophetic Ender’s Game / Enderverse series. Evidently, it comes from Wiucon, Norman for “high and noble.” When I applied for their program coordinator position, I hoped I’d get a chance to ask the staff where they stood on nanotechnology and the financialization, through ubiquitous digital surveillance, of the environment to address climate change.</p>
<p>I’d briefly met Bethany at a presentation on “what works” government that was held at the Furness Library four or five years ago. It shocked me when, during the open discussion period, one attendee stated that residents of North Philadelphia, a predominately Black community, drink too much bottled water. This, of course, was in the aftermath of the Flint poisoned lead drinking water crisis. I vividly remember the person throwing that observation out into the room, after which a second attendee responded that he knew there were social impact investors meeting at the same time Cira Center a few blocks east at 30th Street Station. He posited that surely, those big thinkers could come up with a solution to the bottled water problem. After the meeting, I looked up the Cira Center event and ended up writing a piece that included Sister Mary Scullion’s participation in the 2018 Total Impact conference. That day the meeting room on the top floor of the fine arts library, just down the hall from the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy (a program that’s <a href="https://kleinmanenergy.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/KCEP-Nuclear-Energy-Meets-Climate-Change_updated.pdf">promoting next-gen nuclear as an answer to climate change</a>), had been set up with eight-top tables. A young man was seated next to me. He worked for a bank on workforce development (cue those human capital bonds). Bethany was at the table, too. Afterwards, I struck up a conversation with her and expressed my concerns around impact finance at which point she told me that her husband was an impact investor.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230916025652/https:/ironyofa.medium.com/why-my-family-is-disrupting-routine-for-climate-change-5b7852ae1343">2019 Medium essay</a>, Wiggin described the importance of climate strike activities at Germantown Friends, an elite K12 Philadelphia Quaker school. Her essay also mentioned her husband, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-helgerson-994625/">David Parker Helgerson</a>. According to his LinkedIn profile, Helgerson is a co-head of impact investing at Hamilton Lane headquartered in Conshohocken, just outside Philadelphia. The small town nestled between the Schuylkill Expressway and I-476 also happens to be the home base of the John Templeton Foundation, a philanthropic institution that holds considerable influence through the many, sizeable grants they give towards research in the areas of genius, spirituality, free markets, and theoretical physics. According to Wikipedia, in 2020, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_Lane">Hamilton Lane</a> was the third largest “fund of funds” globally with $65 billion under management. However, a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2023-07-20/hamilton-lane-announces-strategic-leadership-changes">press release from July of 2023</a> noted that their assets had jumped to almost $857 billion. It is important to note, as we examine the role of signals intelligence and distributed ledger technologies in human computation / noetic convergence, that Helgerson’s firm tokenized several of its funds in 2022 on the Polygon blockchain.</p>
<p>Helgerson earned a BA in political science and economics at Swarthmore, a highly-regarded Quaker college west of the city. The school positions itself as progressive while grooming students to implement neoliberal economic policies. Swarthmore has ties to Kenneth Boulding, an influential economist who with his wife Elise advocated world peace, limits to growth, and was considered an early promoter of social entrepreneurship. Christiana Figueres, a Costa Rican diplomat who’s served as the UN’s point person on climate change and almost single-handedly created the field of carbon markets, is an alumna. Helgerson earned an MBA at Duke’s Fuqua School of Business. The program has a strong social impact component, the CASE program, which is why I swung by during my stop in Durham.</p>
<p>I entered Bethany’s office in Williams Hall where thirty-plus years prior my husband earned his PhD. Her first name signifies the Biblical hometown of Lazarus (raised from the dead, which is interesting in the context of regenerative medicine) that Jesus visited before his crucifixion. After exchanging introductions, she made a point of leaving the room to get the printed questions for the interview stating that UPenn’s HR requirements were very rigorous. Each candidate was to be asked the same questions, and that she would be using the timer on her phone to make sure the interview ended promptly after 30 minutes. The symbolic emphasis around time and the phone sitting as a digital barrier between us reminded me of the book “Momo” that I have been reading aloud on my channel.</p>
<p>She wore a striking dress of a modern design with fabric that prominently featured repeated upward pointing triangles. I note this, because of the significance of Platonic solids and Pythagoras’s understanding of the fabric material reality being based in combinations of triangles. Early in our conversation she expressed interest in my blog. It seemed as though she may have read it. Was this why I had gotten the interview? After responding to two questions about my qualifications and reason for leaving my previous position, I explained to her that I cared for the environment, but that I also had serious reservations about the direction things were headed with ubiquitous computing and nanotechnology and finance and game mechanics around climate and carbon trading. I mentioned that Penn was deeply involved in these activities.</p>
<p>I expressed to her how shocked I had been to find out that the ecology movement in the United States emerged from the Atomic Energy Commission. I said it was my sense that Howard Odum’s language of energy exchange, emergy, was a continuation of Gottfried Leibniz’s work – something I thought would have piqued her interest given her academic grounding in German language and comparative literature. Who could have imagined that the “universal language” would turn out to be code? She honestly didn’t seem taken aback by the idea at all. I went on to say that I didn’t think most people understood this history and that we needed more open conversations about the ethical implications of what was being proposed around Web3 and cybernetics within a historical context.</p>
<p>She responded that she thought that the history around the AEC and the Odum family was generally known, however, I strongly disagree. Perhaps within academic circles there might be such an awareness, but not among NPR-listening progressives and the youth who are being whipped up into a frenzy of anxiety over imminent termination of life on this planet. I would hazard a guess that even people who consider themselves well educated are not aware of how MIT, the Club of Rome, and Limits to Growth intersect, let alone <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasan_%C3%96zbekhan">Hasan Obekhan’s</a> involvement in <a href="https://www.m2000.org/associates/">Mankind 2000’s</a> socio-technical systems and organizational theory tied to smart cities at Wharton and its extension into Kevin Werbach’s advocacy for blockchain and behaviorist game mechanics.</p>
<p>I conveyed to her that after my father’s death, I realized I needed a new path, to go out into nature and make a garden and step away from UPenn and Philadelphia and what it represented: von Neumann’s ENIAC; John Lilly’s neural investigations; Eugene Garfield’s bibliometry; and Ted Nelson’s not-yet-realized Project Xanadu. At that point she told me that if I didn’t want the position, the conversation was over. She had set aside thirty minutes to talk with me. Supposedly her program promotes public discussion around how humans relate to the environment. Some might say her response was logical. This was just an interview after all. She held the position of power; but as it turned out, I didn’t actually want what she had to offer. I witnessed no intellectual curiosity. I wasn’t all that surprised, but still, I had rather hoped I would see a spark, some glimmer of engagement. Instead, what I experienced was perfunctory, bureaucratic procedure. Check the boxes for HR and move on to the next person in line – all in a day’s work.</p>
<p>Ivy League schools are not set up to entertain alternative lines of inquiry. There’s a script, and we’re not meant to deviate from it. Because if we did, what would happen to those billions of Hamilton Lane’s assets tied to ESG metrics? What would happen to humanity’s march into bio-digital convergence? How would we achieve their planned nano-technological “ecotopia” if there was no data, no metrics upon which to bet? The noosphere runs on signals intelligence, optimization rules, behavioral compliance, and standards for goodness sake. The clock is ticking. The entire climate simulation program is built on oscillation.</p>
<p>Bethany’s phone timer counted down slices of time in thirty minute chunks. But if you don’t participate according to the rules of the game, don’t expect to get your full allocation. The system will show you the door. No one at Penn wants to hear what you think. It’s about credentials, disciplined minds. Remember, the world is a stage, and we are to shoulder our roles in the multi-agent simulation without question or complaint. Our assignment is to act out the script someone, or possibly something (AI?), placed in our hands. I expect eventually, they’ll heterodyne it, Edward Howard Armstrong-style, uploading lines straight into our consciousness thereby ensuring trust, fidelity, and constancy. As someone whose identity was once built around academic achievement, that was a tough pill to swallow.</p>

<p>Before I left, I showed Bethany a picture I’d taken of an engraved bluestone paver installed in the walk between the Annenberg Center and the Penn Graduate School of Education. Both programs have specific roles to play in technology-based consciousness management. It was one of a series of Ben Franklin quotes. His name wasn’t on any of the inscriptions, just the dates. I’d arrived on campus early with time to kill. I passed several of them before it dawned on me what they were. I then went back to read the ones I’d missed.</p>
<p>To be honest, I continue to struggle with my internal storyline. There is a part of me that still wants to do the thing that is expected, check the box, earn the badge, demonstrate my worth. In my dysfunctional family, I was the “good” kid, and my brother was the “bad” kid. I got the grades, the scholarships, the generous husband, and the comfortable row house. Only decades later did I realize that much of my life was an illusion. I’m left to pick up the pieces and sort out what happened, when it all started to fall apart. I didn’t relish telling Bethany that her program was window-dressing for a global signals intelligence operation that would, if implemented, likely usurp all of natural life in the name of saving the planet. But my professor, Dr. Christa Wilmanns-Wells told me that one day I would see it, and she was right. I did see it, and then I found it impossible to look away. See something, say something, right? Even if people don’t agree with your take, it’s important enough to the future of humanity that we should at least talk about it first, don’t you think?</p>
<p>My father was a man of faith and the scriptures shared during his service reminded me of the importance of being strong and brave and going forth in love. So, with that in the background, I showed Bethany Ben Franklin’s quote. She told me she passed it often. Who knows, maybe I planted a seed, so when she walks by it next time, she will think about the fact that we have not given informed consent to the Millenarian agenda being advanced, in a decentralized manner, across Penn’s campus, each department having no clue how their effort fits into the larger program. The quote read: “Half the truth is often a great lie. 1758” How many of us are accomplices to half-truths? What will the results of our collective complicity in this exercise be for the environment and coming generations?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Ok, so let’s pivot back to me and the Subaru driving through central North Carolina. Sorry, it’s late and I couldn’t make a more graceful narrative transition. I tried to figure out if the inchworm was going to find its way into some remote corner of the car before I got to Seagrove where I hoped to poke around some artist studios and find a utensil crock to take back and lift my spirits. Only later did I realize the synergy this quest had with one of the Bible verses from my dad’s memorial service about God’s treasure and clay vessels.</p>
<p>The inchworm seemed pretty intent on finding an escape. I still had about an hour on the road before reaching the handmade pottery capital of the United States. So, I decided to pull over in a fast-food parking lot and relocate this brilliant green messenger to the base of a tree in a grassy median. I hoped it would be an acceptable replacement for the mimosa tree, but the dry stubbly grass next to the Hardees didn’t look all that promising. After I got home, I looked up inchworm symbolism and found a video likening the inchworm’s movements to the need for integration. </p>
<p>This little creature has legs in the front and back for efficiency, but not in the middle. The front end is always stretching out, but the rear needs time to catch up. I’ll admit with all of the changes underway in my life and society in general, the idea of devoting some time to reflection and incorporating life’s lessons seems like a good idea. Some engineers are deploying bio-inspired design to incorporate the inchworm’s movement into <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2313-7673/7/4/205">soft robotics</a>. When the front and rear legs are next to one another, they make the shape of the Omega. Omega is a stark ending – a door closing, and hopefully new ones opening. Keep this in mind when I get around to talking about Swedenborg and the Church of the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>When I walked into Seagrove Pottery, I looked around, circling the shop several times to assess glazes and crock sizes. Unfortunately, the piece I chose ended up being too tall for the utensils to stick out properly. Nevertheless, the lovely blue with a slight green undertone is so cheerful. I can picture it making a great vase for country wildflower bouquets in the years to come. As I got back into my car, alone now that the inchworm had been dropped off, I looked across the street opposite the parking lot and noticed an unusual sign or was it art? There was a board mounted on two posts depicting painted plates with birds on them. At first, I thought the birds were swallows, but upon closer examination I realized they were actually bluebirds. Bluebirds are messengers of good things to come after difficult times and are associated with visitations from loved ones who have died. The board also featured a plate with a weeping willow design. Of course, in the West the willow is a powerful symbol of mourning, death, renewal and rebirth. When I got home, it dawned on me that the crock I’d selected just happened to be the color of a bluebird.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>It took me a few more hours to get into the Research Triangle area. My first stop was the headquarters of Epic Games in Cary, NC – another installment in Ally’s “scary things coming from banal suburban office buildings” tour. When I arrived at the large mid-rise building about a quarter mile from a strip shopping center with a Target surrounded by gated apartment complexes, there were no signs indicating what the building was. The two entrances simply offered street addresses but did not mention that the structure was home to Epic Games, maker of the Unreal Engine, MetaHumans, and Fortnite, a multiplayer war game developed with capital from the Chinese retailer and social credit scoring behemoth Tencent. There were, however, numerous signs designating the parking lots as private property with closed circuit cameras stating that violators would be prosecuted. The closest place I could find to park was a hotel next door. They even had no trespassing signs four feet into the brush of the swampy water retention basin, I guess in the event that someone decided to penetrate the moat and attempt to steal valuable corporate secrets relating to extended reality programming. I left my sunflower and heart on their entrance sign. We do not consent to your “<a href="https://www.mobygames.com/company/1686/sinister-games-inc/">Sinister Games</a>” Paul Meegan. In the video below from a presentation given on “teaching” and the creative economy at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, which is where I first became aware of Epic Games, Meegan is in the middle in the blue blazer. It took me about half a year before I realized that his insistence that children learn to code his video games, that what he was really saying is that they are going to be expected to build out extended reality. All our lives will be managed by game mechanics.</p>

<p>Next, I went to the campus of NC State in Raleigh, Engineering Building II on the Centennial Campus where Donald Bitzer of the PLATO educational technology and social networking system landed after departing the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign. I left a sunflower and heart in a flower bed by the sign for the building. An informative book on the history of PLATO and its ties to social networks funded by the Office of Naval Research is Brian Dear’s “The Friendly Orange Glow.” I keep saying we have to understand that extended reality is intrinsically linked to Cold War simulation technologies, game theory, and emergence. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseph-gonzalez-91229a86/details/experience/">Joseph Gonzalez</a>, aka Bantam Joe, has said that there is a revolving door between the military and video game design. He saw it firsthand as a veteran who held an industrial top security clearance and carried out electrical engineering work for the US Army and Air Force. Gonzalez worked in Cary, NC for Imagic and Random Games in the late 1990s where he developed player leaderboards, 3D terrain design, and refined the use of artificial intelligence in game engines.</p>

<p>I drove about twenty minutes farther on to the Research Triangle Hub, where according to the interwebs, the Army Research Lab occupies building 800. Originally, I was trying to locate the home of <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/onet/data-collection">O*Net</a>, the Department of Labor’s Occupational Information Network, which I’m guessing will be the backbone of the “cradle to career” platform gig economy / human capital speculation / cybernetic social coordination pipeline. There was no address given, except for O*Net’s consulting partner <a href="https://onet.rti.org/about_rti.cfm">Research Triangle (again with the triangles) Institute</a> (RTI). Playing around with the symbolic nature of the program’s name, I imagine that the “O” could represent a cell, a holonic unit with a semi-permeable membrane, that functions as part of a digital NETwork of social computation. </p>
<p>Many critics of the government’s planned economy / future of work policies would simply slap on the label “socialist” or “communist.” When I identified as progressive, I saw O*Net as a program enabling big business to control labor markets behind the scenes through public-private partnerships. I now recognize the flaws in both ways of thinking. While situating our critiques within established political and philosophical ideologies may be comforting, it’s not going to bring us any closer to understanding the true nature of the problem. In fact, sticking with the team we’ve chosen, whichever side, only serves to obscure the mathematical aspects of the social control grid that is being used in tandem with sophisticated game mechanics to remake our lives and relationships. </p>
<p>Ultimately, the trajectory of Web3 is to bring together both sides of the political spectrum under the banner of digital progress, renewed democracy, choice, and a type of freeDOM that will be mediated by emerging technologies, smart contract protocols. It’s only once we can get a view above the ideological lenses we’ve been using that we will be able to see the labyrinth we’ve been wandering around in for most of our lives. RTI carries out high-level multidisciplinary consulting for the government to ‘improve the human condition,’ cough, cough; but, being short on time and sunflowers, I skipped it and went on to the Army Research Office.</p>

<p>Something did catch my eye opposite the entrance to Building 800. It was a citizen science installation of several beehives painted a bright blue and ornamented with a hexagonal comb pattern, emblazoned with the word “Frontier.” All around were signs encouraging people to live at “the hub.” Again, consider the language here – a hub is the central part of the wheel and shares imagery with nodes in distributed computing. Now, I’m skeptical of all the hubbub around fifteen-minute cities right now, because it seems like a swarm mind virus campaign that could be used to tag, trace, and predict social network behaviors. That said, it is clear to me that the goal for the redevelopment of this scientific research hub, a place with a concentration of biotech and agritech firms, was to be a geographically-defined, mixed use node where people would “live, work, shop, and play!” Signs and lobby displays offered exuberant depictions of smart suburban living options for those who agreed, knowingly or not, to help engineer the bio-physical game mechanics of noetic convergence.</p>

<p>In looking for a cheap place to stay near Duke’s campus, I accidentally ended up at Taberna, an Airbnb operating out of the Fleishman Chabad House. The logo had a prominent “T” that reminded me of a Tau cross. The building had formerly been the King’s Daughter’s House, a Christian charity respite for elderly women, which felt sadly appropriate. The large colonial structure stood between Gloria and Minerva Avenues. A parking lot branched off Alley 16. The latter is unusual name for a street name, and I’m open to hearing your thoughts about the possible significance of the number sixteen. During my trip, I’d been listening to audiobooks of Neal Stephenson’s Baroque Cycle, prequels to Cryptonomicon. One of the plot lines in “Quicksilver” involved a seventeenth-century pirate-hunting ship named the Minerva. The protagonist of Stephenson’s book was named Daniel Waterhouse who read from the Book of Daniel. When I arrived, seemingly the sole guest in the huge house, a young guy offered to help me with my cumbersome duffel since there was no elevator and my room was up three flights of stairs. He told me that he was the building manager, and his name was Daniel.</p>

<p>Julius Stulman, of the Foundation for Integrated Education, was a key early supporter of Chabad in the United States. Chabad is a Hasidic philosophy that emphasizes Jewish mysticism and contemplative prayer, including incorporation of the teachings of Kabbalah into daily life. The Duke Chabad house was named for Joel Fleishman, a professor recruited from Yale by Terry Sanford, then the president of Duke, to launch the university’s school of public policy. Now retired, Fleishman remains involved with the Foundation Research Impact Group, an effort to measure the effectiveness of philanthropy. The rambling building was located across the street from East Campus on Buchanan Avenue. Buchanan was likely named for James Buchanan Duke who founded the American Tobacco Company, launched industrialized cigarette production with mechanized tobacco roller factories, and devised modern marketing tactics to expand the market for his products. In addition to tobacco, Duke also made a fortune in electricity Today Duke Power is a prominent supporter of smart city development in the South. I find this interesting given Michael Levin’s research into bioelectricity, morphogenesis, and personalized medicine.</p>
<p>I settled into my room, which was comfortable despite the strangeness of the setting. The bed had a large, upholstered headboard covered with a botanical print. In fact, this same fabric was used throughout – on the curtain cornices, the loveseat, two slipper chairs, and an upholstered bench. Gradually it dawned on me that the featured plant with coral flowers was nicotiana tabacum – the type of tobacco that was grown for human consumption. A subtropical plant, tobacco has been used for medicinal and spiritual purposes in many cultures of Latin America, the Caribbean, and Africa. It was the Duke family that led the industrialization of this plant for mass consumption. I realized later that the prints over the love seat were stark black and white depictions of contorted topiaries – decidedly unnatural and in keeping with the current push for synthetic biology, sold to us as “bio-inspired design.”</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>One more synchronicity is that on the day I left Philadelphia for Charlotte, I noticed two nicotiana plants in the narrow planting strip of the small school next door to our family’s house. I used to garden on that plot years ago when the building was vacant and I’d planted some tobacco back in the day. Those seeds have real staying power and would sometimes opportunistically pop up in the cracks in the sidewalk. That morning for some reason I happened to look down, and where usually there were pansies or mums, I saw the tobacco. I instinctively picked one leaf and put it in the outer pocket of my backpack and promptly forgot about it. That was until my mother and I were readying ourselves to leave my father’s hospice room after his passing. I couldn’t find my keys anywhere. I ended up taking everything out of my backpack, including the tobacco leaf. Then I found my keys had slid down in an inside pocket. I folded up the leaf and placed it under my father’s folded hands to accompany him on his journey.</p>
<p>One of the primary reasons I decided to stop over in Durham was to see the three locations of the labs run by J.B. Rhine and his successors. Rhine started out getting his PhD in botany. This makes me think about the rising prominence of plant medicine and how the intelligence of sacred plants is being used to create pathways into altered states of consciousness. Could it be that through the use of sophisticated remote neural monitoring techniques, people under spiritual influence with their embodied intelligence, could be used as tools to access, secure, and bring back information that would be inaccessible under normal conditions? I can’t prove it, but I keep turning this concept of digitally-mediated mediumship over in my mind, its possible overlap with the human potential movement, distributed cognition, and blockchained group mind. This topic is getting a lot of attention lately with the move towards adoption of hallucinogenic substances to “treat” addiction. It also brings to mind Kevin “Green Pill” Owocki’s references to Michael Pollan’s thesis from “The Botany of Desire” that plants may in fact be cultivating humans rather than the other way around.</p>
<p>Rhine pioneered scientific evaluation of psychic activities, including extra-sensory perception. Among his colleagues was Margaret Mead, who held an interest in the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00787R000500240025-6.pdf">psychic potential of precognition and remote viewing</a>. Conrad Hilton Rice, a collaborator with Oliver Reiser whose theories were featured in “World Sensorium,” <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/J_B_Rhine/U0ooEAAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=j.b.+rhine+%22oliver+reiser%22&amp;pg=PA166&amp;printsec=frontcover">corresponded</a> with J.B. Rhine. For three and a half decades starting in 1930, Rhine <a href="https://archives.lib.duke.edu/?f%5Blevel_sim%5D%5B%5D=Collection&amp;f%5Bnames_ssim%5D%5B%5D=Mead%2C+Margaret%2C+1901-1978&amp;range%5Bdate_range_sim%5D%5Bbegin%5D=1949&amp;range%5Bdate_range_sim%5D%5Bend%5D=1949&amp;sort=title_sort+desc">worked in the West Building of Duke’s East Campus</a>. In 1965, the institute changed its name to the Foundation for Research on the Nature of Man and moved across Buchanan Street to the intersection with Trinity Avenue. That building would later by acquired by the Catholic Church. The <a href="https://www.rhineonline.org/about-us">Rhine Research Center</a>, is still operating less than a mile from Duke’s medical research campus.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>By the time I arrived at the West Building, the sun was starting to go down. The angle of the light made it hard to find a good place to take a photo, so I walked all the way around the building. As I came around front, I caught a glimpse of blue in a young willow oak and saw it was a bluebird. That bluebird was joined by second and then a third. I was surprised to see this cheerful group out at dusk. There was no doubt in my mind that they were bluebirds, not the swallows I expected to see. I remembered the bluebird sign from Seagrove earlier that day. The trio flitted from tree to tree before landing high in the branches of a majestic old oak. At its base I set my intention for my dad, that we stay connected so he might continue to guide me as I navigate the choppy waters ahead.</p>

<p>My final two stops were at Duke’s Fuqua Business School, home to the CASE social impact program, and the Nicolelis Neurobiology Lab on the medical research campus where experiments were done using data from monkey brains and kinematic sensors in Durham to remotely “walk” a bi-pedal Sarcos robot in Kyoto Japan. Adjacent to Fuqua was the law school, where <a href="https://law.duke.edu/fac/farahany/">Nita Farahany</a>, bioethicist and WEF spokesperson for a future where a person’s thoughts are no longer private, is based. The Sanford Social Policy School, where Joel Fleishman was based, sits directly across from the law school. There are profound implications for these technologies, not only due to their Frankenstein-like nature, but for globalized remote haptic labor and synthetic telepathy. For me, this work appears to be an extension of Rhine’s investigations with the addition of sophisticated electrical engineering technologies and nano-biosensors.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>There are so many things we should be talking about, but it feels like it’s practically impossible to cut through the noise and manufactured influencer distractions. Nevertheless, I continue my investigations, mapping relationships across time and space. I do site visits where I assert that the public has in fact NOT given informed consent to gamified consciousness engineering. I keep at it because I feel driven to understand for myself how we got here. I’m trying to imagine where we may be going as a society if our collective consciousness ends up harnessed to some artificial, decentralized, cybernetic guidance system. I’ve come to realize over the past few years that it is actually impossible for any one person to know “the truth” with any degree of certainty. There’s simply too much information for us to hold and evaluate all once, lifetimes upon lifetimes of details that could be woven into patterns shaping our worldviews. And yet, I also sense we are in a spiritual struggle, and there are lessons out there waiting for me to learn. I guess you could imagine it as a magnificently expansive independent study.</p>
<p>I am choosing to hold the belief that my father’s passing, as painful as it is, will teach me to be a better person in the days, months, and years to come. It’s all connected. I’m just not sure how yet. The homily for my father’s life celebration featured a passage on The New Jerusalem, the Alpha and Omega, a time when all tears and pain would be wiped away along with the old ways of being. My mother had suggested the verse, only she’d mistakenly transposed the numbers when she told the pastor. Instead of <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2021&amp;version=NCV">Revelations 21</a>, she’d said 12. He was taken aback, saying that probably wasn’t it, because <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2012&amp;version=NIV">Revelations 12</a> has to do with the whore of Babylon and a dragon sweeping stars from the sky.</p>
<p>That holds a certain resonance with me, because Johannes Kelpius and the monks of the Wissahickon came to Germantown, outside of Philadelphia to wait for the woman of the wilderness, the woman described in Revelations 12. Emanuel Swedenborg’s Church of the New Jerusalem was centered on <a href="https://www.biblicalcyclopedia.com/S/swedenborg-emanuel.html">Revelations 21</a>. Swedenborg was a Swedish mystic who walked the realms. Both Andrew Carnegie, whose fortune and “philanthropic” activities have been leading up to the noosphere for the past century and a half and the Pitcairn family, of PPG plate glass, both attended Pittsburgh’s Swedenborgian church growing up. Swedenborg’s writings influenced the development of transpersonal psychology as well as Jung. He also popularized the motif of the vagina dentata, the sacred feminine as a threatening presence. The Pitcairns built a cathedral for the Church of the New Jerusalem in Bryn Athyn, about a half-hour north of Philadelphia. They also constructed a museum, situated among several mansions on the glass-maker’s large estate, to house Swedenborg’s papers. The logo of the church, an intertwined Alpha and Omega, can be seen in the site’s wayfinding signs and a topiary boxwood hedge. As it turns out, I’d just added Swedenborg to my San Patrignano map, associated with Carnegie and Carnegie-Mellon. It felt surreal to have all of these unexpected connections popping off in the context of my father’s send off.</p>

<p></p>
<p>My sister-in-law and I didn’t want the gathering in his honor to be a sad affair. We hatched a plan to create a festive table setting featuring dad’s favorite junk foods with an invitation offered in fun bubble letters to “dig in”: Diet Coke, taquitos, peanut M&amp;Ms, Hershey bars, and cheese curls. After meeting with the pastor we went stopped at Sam’s Club to pick up a few boxes of the frozen taquitos he used to crave. When we walked into the store there was a seasonal display of Halloween items, including a huge lit up animatronic dragon, which was a strange coincidence given our conversation not an hour earlier about the passage from Revelations 12:3 “Then another sign appeared in heaven, an enormous red dragon with seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns on its head. Its tail swept a third of the stars out of the sky and flung them to the earth.”</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The day of his memorial we went back to the store to pick up steaks, to be eaten in his honor with a bourbon toast. My dad loved grilling steaks and Wild Turkey 101. Over in the refrigerator section was a sample stand. The featured sample of the day was taquitos. I told the woman staffing the booth that we’d just come from my father’s memorial and that we’d had two platters of taquitos to share. She said it made her very happy to hear it.</p>
<p>The understandings I hold have unexpectedly made me a social dissident. It’s hard to imagine the world turning upside down in the course of just a few years. The fitness landscape of Web3 has little tolerance for square pegs in a universe of round nodes. The time has come for reinvention, and when I look back, I hope I will see that this terrible year was a tough-love gift in disguise. As much as I miss my dad, he wasn’t available to me during the last years of his life. I lived at a distance, my mother didn’t want me around, and our communication was limited by his hearing loss and dementia. Now, on this part of my journey, I picture him restored in heaven keeping me company from an angelic distance. I sense we have an energetic bond, heart signals shared across a hospice bed. I close my eyes and feel his bear hugs across the dimensions. I don’t have a husband or child to hug me anymore, so that will have to be enough. God has his eye on the sparrow and on the inchworm and on me, too.</p>
<p>Below are the passages read during the memorial service. I’m sharing them here, because as this journey unfolds, I suspect I’ll be referring to them for guidance and comfort. Another hymn chosen by my mother for the program was “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_of_the_Dance_(hymn)">Lord of the Dance</a>,” sung to the Shaker tune of “Simple Gifts.” My dad loved Elvis and the oldies, and the ideals of being simple and free seem perfectly suited to this moment in time. </p>
<p>I’ll be keeping an eye out for bluebirds and sunflowers dad. I miss you.</p>
<p>Psalm 121</p>
<p>I lift up my eyes to the mountains – where does my help come from? My help comes from the Lord, the maker of heaven and earth. He will not let your foot slip – he who watches over you will not slumber; indeed, he who watches over Israel will neither slumber nor sleep. The Lord watches over you – the Lord is your shade at your right hand; the sun will not harm you by day, nor the moon at night. The Lord will keep you from all harm – he will watch over your life; the Lord will watch over your coming and going both now and forevermore.</p>
<p>Psalm 139: 1-18</p>
<p>O Lord, you have searched me and known me! You know when I sit down and when I rise up; you discern my thoughts from afar. You search out my path and my lying down and are acquainted with all my ways. Even before a word is on my tongue, behold, O Lord, you know it altogether. You hem me in, behind and before, and lay your hand upon me. Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high; I cannot attain it. Where shall I go from your spirit? Or where shall I flee your presence? If I ascend to heaven, you are there! If I make my bed in Sheol, you are there! If I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea and even there your hand shall hold me. If I say, “Surely the darkness shall cover me, and the light about me be night,” even the darkness is not dark to you; the night is bright as the day for darkness is as light with you.</p>
<p>For you formed my inward parts; you knitted me together in my mother’s womb. I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Wonderful are your works. My soul knows it very well. My frame was not hidden from you, when I was being made in secret, intricately woven in the depths of the earth. Your eyes saw my unformed substance; in your book were written, every one of them, the days that were formed for me, when as yet there was none of them. How precious to me are your thoughts, O God! How vast is the sum of them! If I would count them, they are more than the sand. I awake, and I am still with you.</p>
<p>Isaiah 40</p>
<p>Hast thou not known? Hast though not heard that the everlasting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the Earth, fainteth not, neither is weary? There is no searching of his understanding. He giveth power to the faint, and to them that have no might he increaseth strength. Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall: but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.</p>
<p>2 Corinthians 4: 7-10 </p>
<p>But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us. We are hard pressed on every side, but not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed. We always carry around in our body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body.</p>
<p>2 Corinthians 4: 16-5</p>
<p>Therefore, we do not lose heart. Though outwardly we are wasting away, yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day.</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 16: 13-14</p>
<p>Be on your guard; stand firm in the faith, be courageous; be strong. Do everything in love.</p>
<p>Revelation 21: 1-6</p>
<p>Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea. I saw the Holy city, the new Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Look! God’s dwelling place is now among the people, and he will dwell among them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God. He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away. He who was seated on the throne said, ” I am making everything new!” Then he said, “Write this down for these words are trustworthy and true.” He said to me: “It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. To the thirsty I will give water without cost from the spring of the water of life.”</p>
<p>Proverbs 10:9</p>
<p>Whoever walks in integrity walks security, but whoever takes crooked paths will be found out.</p>
<p>Proverbs 16:3</p>
<p>Commit to the Lord whatever you do, and he will establish your plans.</p>
<p>Proverbs 16: 6</p>
<p>By mercy and truth iniquity is purged, and by the fear of the Lord men depart from evil.</p>
<p>Proverbs 20: 6</p>
<p>Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness; but a faithful man, who can find?</p>
<p>Galatians 6: 9-10</p>
<p>And let us not be weary in well doing for in due season, we shall reap if we faint not. As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good to all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith.</p>

<p>In April, I <a href="https://blog.joeandrieu.com/2023/04/12/fighting-for-consensus-at-the-w3c/">appealed</a> a decision by the W3C Chairs to place DID Methods in scope in the next DID WG Charter. </p>



<p>That appeal was <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-did-wg/2023Jul/0000.html">ignored</a> and the charter advanced to AC Review.</p>



<p>This is our Formal Objection to that charter.</p>



<p>We oppose this charter on several grounds.</p>



  Process  Collaboration  Technical Fundamentals  Interoperability Goals  



 PROCESS 



<p>We stand by our appeal (<a href="https://blog.joeandrieu.com/2023/04/12/fighting-for-consensus-at-the-w3c/">https://blog.joeandrieu.com/2023/04/12/fighting-for-consensus-at-the-w3c/</a>), which we feel was improperly handled. The Process rules, about consensus, appeals, and Formal Objections, in our opinion, were ignored.</p>



<p>The incident (and the appeal) were filed under Process 2021; the current process is Process 2023. Staff’s response meets the requirements of neither Process. Since Philippe Le Hegaret cited Process 2023 in his response to my appeal, let’s look at what Process 2023 requires.</p>



<p>Process 2023 requires Groups to formally address issues with a response that includes a rationale for decisions that “a W3C reviewer would generally consider to be technically sound”. Neither Philippe Le Hegaret’s nor the Chairs’ responses met that standard. Philippe simply claimed that “this charter is the most acceptable for the majority of the group (an assessment that was confirmed by a recent poll); and that 2) the charter is not a WG deliverable, and consensus must be reached at the AC level anyway, so Joe’s argument should be raised during AC review, not prior to it.”</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the cited poll did not even attempt to gauge consensus. It merely gauged the popularity of advancing the WG, without consideration of the multiple options under consideration by members of the group. Rather than attempting to establish a legitimate vote, Staff created a poll that, like a Politburo election, only offered one candidate to vote on, where, in fact, it should have been inquiring about any objections to best understand the proposal with the weakest objections, instead of blatantly attempting to rubber stamp the offending decision.</p>



<p>More problematic is that the rules for Formal Objections were not followed. There should have been a W3C Council formed to evaluate the objection on its own merits, prior to AC Review.</p>



<p>Staff’s assertion that “consensus must be reached at the AC level anyway” is fundamentally in error. The AC is not involved in resolving formal objections. Councils are.</p>



<p>According to Process 2023, a Council MUST be formed to consider the merits of the objection.</p>



<p>Given that the objection was filed April 12, Staff should have started a council no later than July 11, 2023. PRIOR to sending the Charter to review by the AC. Unfortunately, no council was formed. Instead, on July 26, Philippe finally responded to the appeal by saying Staff is going to ignore it. On August 8, the charter was proposed, unchanged, to the AC for review.</p>



<p>One may raise the concern that the new process was not adopted until June 12, leaving Staff only a month before the deadline. However, Staff did not have to wait until the process was adopted. They could have responded under the previous process any time before June 12 or, realizing that the process was likely to be adopted, they could have begun the prep work to start the council in a timely manner, as required. The idea of councils had been extensively debated and iterated on months before I filed my appeal to the chair decision. And yet, we still have no council.</p>



<p>Further as part of its obligations under Process 2023 when there are Formal Objections, Staff is tasked with investigation and mediation. Since Staff’s efforts in that regard did not lead to consensus–by Staff’s own acknowledgement–its only option is to form a council and prepare a report:<br>“Upon concluding that consensus cannot be found, and no later than 90 days after the Formal Objection being registered, the Team must initiate formation of a W3C Council, which should be convened within 45 days of being initiated. Concurrently, it must prepare a report for the Council documenting its findings and attempts to find consensus.”</p>



<p>As a result, the AC is reviewing not the legitimate continuation of the DID Working Group, but rather a hijacking of the work that I and others have given years of time and effort to advance.</p>



 



 COLLABORATION 



<p>Taking the charitable position that everyone involved continues to act in good faith and the process as defined was properly followed (even if its documentation might be inadequate), then we still oppose this charter on the grounds that the development of the charter violated the fundamental purpose of the W3C: collaboration through consensus.</p>



<p>The question we ask is this: should WG chairs be able to propose a continuation of that WG without consensus from the WG itself? Should anyone?</p>



<p>This is the situation we’re in and I did not expect that collaboration at the W3C would look like this.</p>



<p>I first got involved with W3C work by volunteering feedback to the Verifiable Credentials Task Force on their draft use case document. From those early days, I was asked to join as an invited expert and have since led the use case and requirements efforts for both Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized Identifiers, where I remain an editor. I also developed and continue to edit the DID Method Rubric a W3C NOTE. Somewhere in that tenure I also served as co-chair of the W3C Credentials Community Group.</p>



<p>During this time, I have been impressed by the organizations’ advocacy for consensus as something unique to its operations. The idea of consensus as a foundational goal spoke not only to my heart as a human being seeking productive collaborations with others, but also to my aspirations as a professional working on decentralized identity.</p>



<p>And then, citing a non-binding recommendation by the then-acting director in response to previous Formal Objections, the chairs of the DID WG turned that narrative of consensus upside down.</p>



 



<p>Here’s what happened:</p>



<p>June 30, 2022 – DID Core decision by Director “In its next chartered period the Working Group should address and deliver proposed standard DID method(s) and demonstrate interoperable implementations. The community and Member review of such proposed methods is the natural place to evaluate the questions raised by the objectors and other Member reviewers regarding decentralization, fitness for purpose, and sustainable resource utilization.” Ralph Swick, for Tim Berners-Lee<br><a href="https://www.w3.org/2022/06/DIDRecommendationDecision.html">https://www.w3.org/2022/06/DIDRecommendationDecision.html</a></p>



<p>July 19, 2022 – DID WG Charter extended, in part “to discuss during TPAC the rechartering of the group in maintenance mode.” Xueyuan xueyuan@w3.org <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-did-wg/2022Jul/0023.html">https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-did-wg/2022Jul/0023.html</a></p>



<p>August 18, 2022 – Brent Zundel proposed to add DID Methods in PR#20 <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/20">https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/20</a></p>



<p>September 1, 2022 – Group email from Brent Zundel about TPAC “We plan to discuss the next WG charter and will hopefully end up with a draft ready to pass on to the next stage in the process.” Brent Zundel <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-did-wg/2022Sep/0001.html">https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-did-wg/2022Sep/0001.html</a></p>



<p>The Charter at the time of announcement <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/blob/af23f20256f4107cdaa4f2e601a7dbd38f4a20b8/index.html">https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/blob/af23f20256f4107cdaa4f2e601a7dbd38f4a20b8/index.html</a></p>



<p>September 12, 2022 – Group meeting at TPAC “There seems to be strong consensus that we’d rather focus on resolution” <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/Meetings/Minutes/2022-09-12-did">https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/Meetings/Minutes/2022-09-12-did</a></p>



<p>September 20, 2022 – Summary of TPAC. Manu Sporny <a href="mailto:msporny@digitalbazaar.com">msporny@digitalbazaar.com</a> “The DID Working Group meeting had significant attendance (40-50 people). The goal was to settle on the next Working Group Charter. […] There were objections to standardizing DID Methods. […] There didn’t seem to be objections to DID Resolution or maintaining DID Core.”<br><a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2022Sep/0177.html">https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2022Sep/0177.html</a></p>



<p>September 21, 2022 – PR#20 from Brent Zundel merges, without discussion or any notice to the WG, PR#20 DID Method resolution into spec, saying “I am merging this PR over their objections because having the flexibility to go this route could be vital should our efforts to move DID Resolution forward be frustrated.”</p>



<p>October 18, 2002 – DID Resolution PR #25 created to add DID Resolution</p>



<p>October 24, 2002 – DID Resolution PR #25 merged, adds DID Resolution</p>



<p>October 25, 2022 – Reviewing other work, I discovered the unannounced merge of #20 and commented asking to revert. <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/20#issuecomment-1291199826">https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/20#issuecomment-1291199826</a></p>



<p>December 14, 2022 – Brent Zundel created PR #27 to add DID Methods and DID Resolution to the deliverables section.</p>



<p>December 15, 2022 – DID WG Charter extended to “allow the group to prepare its new charter” Xueyuan xueyuan@w3.org <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-did-wg/2022Dec/0000.html">https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-did-wg/2022Dec/0000.html</a></p>



<p>The Charter at the time of the December 15 extension <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/blob/b0f79f90ef7b8e089335caa301c01f3fc3f8f1ef/index.html">https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/blob/b0f79f90ef7b8e089335caa301c01f3fc3f8f1ef/index.html</a></p>



<p>December 15, 2022 – Brent Zundel asserts consensus is not required. “There are no WG consensus requirements in establishing the text of the charter.” And “The time and place to have the conversation about whether the charter meets the needs of the W3C is during AC review.” <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/27#issuecomment-1353537492">https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/27#issuecomment-1353537492</a> </p>



<p>January 19, 2023 — Christopher Allen raised issue #28 suggesting DID Resolution WG instead of DID WG. <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/issues/28">https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/issues/28</a> </p>



<p>January 23, 2023 – Brent Zundel initially welcomes seeing a DID Resolution WG charter. <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/issues/28#issuecomment-1401211528">https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/issues/28#issuecomment-1401211528</a> </p>



<p>January 23, 2023 – Brent Zundel continues to argue that consensus does not apply: “This charter is not a DID WG deliverable. It is not on the standards track, nor is it a WG Note, nor is it a registry. Thus, the strong demands of WG consensus on its contents do not apply. Consensus comes into play somewhat as it is drafted, but primarily when it is presented to the AC for its consideration.” <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/27#issuecomment-1401199754">https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/27#issuecomment-1401199754</a></p>



<p>January 24, 2032 — Brent Zundel creates PR #29 offering an alternative to PR #27, excluding the offending language. <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/29">https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/29</a></p>



<p>March 13, 2023 — Christopher Allen raises Pull Request #30 proposing a DID Resolution WG charter. <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/30#issue-1622126514">https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/30#issue-1622126514</a></p>



<p>March 14, 2023 — Brent Zundel admits he never actually considered PR #30 “It was never my understanding that a DID Resolution WG would replace the DID WG. I do not support that course of action. If folks are interested in pursuing a DID Resolution WG Charter separate from the DID WG Charter, the place to do it is not here.” <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/30#pullrequestreview-1339576495">https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/30#pullrequestreview-1339576495</a></p>



<p>March 15, 2023 – Brent Zundel merged in PR #27 over significant dissent “The DID WG chairs have met. We have concluded that merging PR #27 will produce a charter that best represents the consensus of the DID Working Group participants over the past year.” “The inclusion of DID Methods in the next chartered DID WG was part of the W3C Director’s decision to overturn the Formal Objections raised against the publication of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0. The chairs feel that that decision represents the consensus of the W3C and as such the inclusion of DID Methods as optional work in this charter is absolutely necessary.” <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/27#issuecomment-1470920464">https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/27#issuecomment-1470920464</a></p>



<p>March 21, 2023 – Announcement of intention to Appeal Joe Andrieu joe@legreq.com <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/27#issuecomment-1478595775">https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/27#issuecomment-1478595775</a></p>



<p>March 23, 2023 – Clarification from Philippe Le Hegaret<br>‘The “should” is NOT a “must”, otherwise it would say so explicitly in the Director’s decision. In other words, the Working Group is allowed to disagree with the direction set by the Director.’ Personal email from Philippe</p>



<p>March 30, 2023 – DID WG Charter extended. “The goal of this extension is to allow the group to propose its new charter [2], which the chairs consider reasonably stable now. ” xueyuan xueyuan@w3.org<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-did-wg/2023Mar/0000.html"> https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-did-wg/2023Mar/0000.html</a></p>



<p>April 12, 2023 — Appeal of Chair Decision filed <a href="https://blog.joeandrieu.com/2023/04/12/fighting-for-consensus-at-the-w3c/">https://blog.joeandrieu.com/2023/04/12/fighting-for-consensus-at-the-w3c/</a></p>



<p>June 12, 2023 — A new process document is adopted. Removes Director. Rather than the “Director, the W3C Council, which is composed of TAG+AB+CEO, will now hear and resolve formal objections.” “Merge Chair Decision Appeal, Group Decision Appeal, and Formal Objection; clarify what can be objected to.” <a href="https://www.w3.org/2023/Process-20230612">https://www.w3.org/2023/Process-20230612</a> </p>



<p>May 9-10, 2023 – Advisory Committee meeting in Sophia Antipolis. Joe Andrieu attended. Neither co-chair attended.</p>



<p>May 11, 2023 — Joe Andrieu reports success on conversations with prior formal objectors ‘There was exceptional support for focusing on resolution rather than DID methods as the route to interoperability. “That would go a long way to addressing our concerns” and “Yep, that seems like the better way to do it” and “That seems reasonable, but I need to think on it a bit more [before I say it resolves the issues of our FO].” I think it’s fair to say that a focus on resolution (without any DID methods) would likely avoid a FO from 2 out of 3 and, quite possibly all 3. <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/issues/28#issuecomment-1543579206">https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/issues/28#issuecomment-1543579206</a></p>



<p>May 11, 2023 — Brent Zundel claims confidence that we can “move through the charter development process and end up with something that no one objects to.“ <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/issues/28#issuecomment-1544358479">https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/issues/28#issuecomment-1544358479</a></p>



<p>May 22, 2023 – Pierre-Antoine Champin published survey to did-wg charter.<br>“Would you agree to  sending the current version of the charter proposal to the Advisory Committee for review?”<br>This questionnaire was open from 2023-05-22 to 2023-06-20.<br>40 yes (85%)<br>6 no (15%)<br><a href="https://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/117488/rechartering_survey/">https://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/117488/rechartering_survey/</a></p>



<p>July 26, 2023 — Philippe Le Hegaret dismisses appeal. “W3C team concurs there is no consensus” <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-did-wg/2023Jul/0000.html">https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-did-wg/2023Jul/0000.html</a></p>



<p>August 8, 2023 – Proposed DID WG Charter Call for Review “There is not consensus among the current working group participants as to whether the charter should permit work on the specification of DID methods. This charter proposal includes the option for the group to do that work if there is sufficient interest. This follows the director’s advice in the DID Core 1.0 Recommendation decision [3] to include the specification of DID methods in the future scope of the work.” <a href="https://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/33280/did-wg-2023/">https://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/33280/did-wg-2023/</a></p>



<p>August 8, 2023 – Brent Zundel asserts in W3C Credentials Community Group meeting that “In my experience, Formal Objections are noted and are usually overridden…” <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/meetings/2023-08-08/">https://w3c-ccg.github.io/meetings/2023-08-08/</a></p>



<p>No DID WG Meetings whatsoever after January of 2022.</p>



<p>These, I believe, are the relevant facts of the situation, covering the thread of this debate from its beginning through to today.</p>



 



<p>Why does it matter?</p>



<p>Because consensus is how the W3C delivers legitimate technical specifications.</p>



<p>Because the record clearly shows that the chairs never intended nor attempted to seek consensus and resolve objections to their initial proposal. In their defense, they argue consensus doesn’t apply, which if correct, would justify their behavior. However, we can’t see anything–neither in the member agreement nor in the process document–that constrain’s the requirement that chairs seek consensus to any particular activity.</p>



<p>We believe three points should prevail in this discussion:</p>



<p>First, we see the deference to the past director’s comments as completely outside the Process.</p>



<p>Second, regardless of intent or process, we believe that charter development for an existing working group MUST achieve consensus within that WG before advancing to AC Review.</p>



<p>Third, we see the chairs’ argument regarding the inapplicabilty of consensus to violate the fundamental point of the organization: consensuse-based collaboration.</p>



<p>Let’s look at each of these in terms of what it would take to deny these points.</p>



 



<p>For the first point, we could interpret the will of “The Director” in his response to the prior Formal Objections as a mandatory requirement.</p>



<p>As we asked formally in our appeal, it may well be that this outcome was always the intention of Staff. “Since the chairs are claiming a mandate from the Director as the justification for their decision, I am directly asking the Director if what is happening is, in fact, what the Director required.”</p>



<p>Staff answered this question by endorsing the Chairs’ decision, relying on the “Director’s comments” as justification. Staff and the chairs believe that it is appropriate for a past decision by the past Director to bind the future work of a Working Group.</p>



<p>I find this unreasonable and contrary to Process. Nowhere in any Process document does Staff or the Director get the right to mandate the work of working groups. Nor does the Process give Staff, Director or otherwise, the right to bind future work of WGs. </p>



<p>Even Phillippe Le Hegaret acknowledged that the Director’s comments did not require the group adopt that recommendation: “It’s a SHOULD not a MUST.” And yet, he claims that his decision to advance the current Charter “follows the director’s advice in the DID Core 1.0 Recommendation decision”.</p>



<p>Working Groups should be the sole determinant of the work that they perform. It is not Staff’s role to direct the technical work of the organization. It’s Staff’s role to support the technical work of the organization, by ensuring the smooth operation of Process.</p>



<p>We do not buy the argument that Ralph Swick, acting on behalf of the past Director in a decision made about a previous work item, appropriately justifies the willful denial of consensus represented by this charter.</p>



<p>The fact of the matter is that DID interoperability is a subtle challenge, not well understood by everyone evaluating the specifications. If we could have had a conversation with the Director–which I asked for multiple times–perhaps we could have cleared up the confusion and advanced a proposal that better resolves the objections of everyone who expressed concerns. But not only did that conversation not happen, it CANNOT happen because of the change in Process. We no longer have a Director. To bind the future work of the DID WG to misunderstandings of Ralph Swick, acting as the Director, is to force technical development to adhere to an untenable, unchallengeable mandate.</p>



<p>What we should have had is a healthy conversation with all of the stakeholders involved, including the six members of the WG who opposed the current charter as well as anyone other participants who cared to chime in. The chairs explicitly prevented this from happening by cancelling all working group meetings, failing to bring the matter to the groups attention through the mailing list, or otherwise attempting to arrange a discussion that could find a proposal with weaker objections as required by process.</p>



<p>Failing that, we should have had a W3C Council to review my appeal as per Section 5.5 and 5.6 of the current Process. That council may well have been able to find a proposal that addressed everyone’s concerns. That also did not happen. Rather than respond to my objection in a timely manner, staff advanced the non-consensual charter to AC review.</p>



<p>Finally, even if we accept that Ralph Swick, acting as the Director, in fact, officially represented the consensus of the W3C in the matter of the DID Core 1.0 specification (for the record, we do), the recommendation that resulted represents the formal W3C consensus at the time of the DID Core 1.0 specification, solely on the matter of its adoption as a Recommendation. It cannot represent the consensus of the W3C on the forced inclusion of unnamed DID Methods in the next DID WG Charter, because the organization has not engaged in seeking consensus on this matter yet. Not only did the chairs ignore their responsibility to seek consensus, Staff has as well.</p>



<p>I would like to think that every WG at the W3C would like to be able to set their own course based on the consensus of their own participants, rather than have it mandated by leadership.</p>



 



 



<p>For the second point, you could endorse that charter development is not subject to consensus, as argued by the Chairs.</p>



<p>The chairs claim that “This charter is not a DID WG deliverable. […] Thus, the strong demands of WG consensus on its contents do not apply.”</p>



<p>I find this untenable on two different grounds.</p>



<p>First, the Process does not restrict the commitment to consensus to just Working Group deliverables. The language is broad and unambiguous: “To promote consensus, the W3C process requires Chairs to ensure that groups consider all legitimate views and objections, and endeavor to resolve them, whether these views and objections are expressed by the active participants of the group or by others (e.g., another W3C group, a group in another organization, or the general public).”</p>



<p>The Process in fact, includes examples of seeking consensus that have nothing to do with formal deliverables.</p>



<p>Second, this interpretation would mean that, according to process, ANYONE could propose a new Working Group charter, with the same name and infrastructure as a current Working Group, WITHOUT seeking the consensus of the Working Group involved. All one needs is for Staff to support that effort. On their own initiative, Staff can simply hijack the work of a working group by recruiting chairs willing to propose a new charter without the input of the current group.</p>



<p>This is untenable. If a Working Group is still in existence, it should be a fundamental requirement that any charter proposals that continue that work achieve the consensus of the working group. Of course, if the WG is no longer operating, that’s a different situation. But in this case, the WG is still active. We even discussed the Charter in our meeting at TPAC where upon its first presentation no fewer than five participants objected to including DID Methods in scope.</p>



<p>Frankly, if a Charter proposal does not represent consensus of the group selected by staff to develop the charter… it should not advance to AC Review. Full stop.</p>



<p>That’s the whole point of charter development: for a small group of motivated individuals to figure out what they want to do together and propose that to the organization. If that small group can’t reach consensus, then they haven’t figured it out enough to advance it to AC Review. They should go back to the drawing board and revise the proposal until it achieves consensus. THEN, and only then, should it be proposed to Staff for consideration. When Staff receives a charter proposal that lacks consensus, it should reject it as a matter of course, having not met the fundamental requirements.</p>



 



 



<p>For the third point, you could accept the position that the chairs met their duty to seek consensus simply by asserting that there is no consensus.</p>



<p>This argument was raised by other W3C members (not the chairs or staff): the W3C has historically given broad remit to chairs to determine consensus, so whatever they do for “consensus” is, by definition, canon. This disposition is noted in the process itself “Chairs have substantial flexibility in how they obtain and assess consensus among their groups.” and “If questions or disagreements arise, the final determination of consensus remains with the chair.”</p>



<p>As the current discussion has shown, that latter statement is, as a matter of fact, incorrect. The chairs asserted a determination of consensus in this matter “PR #27 will produce a charter that best represents the consensus of the DID Working Group participants over the past year” which Staff judged inadequate: “There is not consensus among the current working group participants as to whether the charter should permit work on the specification of DID methods.” So, either the policy is in error because, in fact, the Staff is the ultimate determiner of consensus, or, Staff ignored process to impose their own determination.</p>



<p>However, even if Chairs have wide remit to determine consensus, the process unequivocally requires chairs to do two things:</p>



  ensure that groups consider all legitimate views and objections  endeavor to resolve [those objections]  



<p>In short, the chairs must actively engage with objectors to resolve their concerns.</p>



<p>The chairs did not do this.</p>



<p>First, they did not do any of the following suggestions in the process document about how to seek consensus:</p>



  Groups should favor proposals that create the weakest objections. This is preferred over proposals that are supported by a large majority but that cause strong objections from a few people. (5.2.2. Managing Dissent https://www.w3.org/2023/Process-20230612/#managing-dissent)  A group should only conduct a vote to resolve a substantive issue after the Chair has determined that all available means of reaching consensus through technical discussion and compromise have failed, and that a vote is necessary to break a deadlock. (5.2.3 Deciding by Vote) https://www.w3.org/2023/Process-20230612/#Votes  A group has formally addressed an issue when it has sent a public, substantive response to the reviewer who raised the issue. A substantive response is expected to include rationale for decisions (e.g., a technical explanation, a pointer to charter scope, or a pointer to a requirements document). The adequacy of a response is measured against what a W3C reviewer would generally consider to be technically sound. (5.3 Formally Addressing an Issue https://www.w3.org/2023/Process-20230612/#formal-address )  The group should reply to a reviewer’s initial comments in a timely manner. (5.3 Formally Addressing an Issue https://www.w3.org/2023/Process-20230612/#formal-address )  



<p>The record shows that chairs, rather than doing any of the above recommended actions for consensus, consistently avoided seeking consensus by dismissing concerns and merging PRs without actually seeking to address objectors’ concerns.</p>



<p>PR #20 still has no comments from either Chair. It was merged in over objections despite the working groups exceptionally consistent practice that unless there is consensus for a given change, PRs don’t get merged in.</p>



<p>In fact, controversial edits in this working group regularly receive a 7-day hold with, at minimum, a Github label of a pending action (to close or merge), and often an explicit mention in minutes of the meeting in which the change was discussed. PR #20 was merged by executive fiat, without adherence to the norms of the group and the requirements of process. If you feel charters don’t need consensus, maybe you’re ok with that. We’re not.</p>



<p>It’s clear that in the case of PR #20, Brent Zundel made an executive decision that was contrary to the groups established norms of requiring consensus before merging. Given that Brent never wavered in his commitment to the specific point of including DID Methods in scope as the “only option”, it’s clear that, at least on that point, he never intended to seek consensus.</p>



<p>In PR #27 Brent Zundel and Pierra-Antoine Champin (team contact) dismissed the concerns of objectors rather than “endeavoring to address” them.</p>



<p>Brent asserts that “flexibility in the charter does not require a group to perform any work” And “a future charter that doesn’t include possible DID Methods will be rejected” and “the strong demands of WG consensus on its contents do not apply.”</p>



<p>Pierre-Antoine asserts that “Considering the two points above, the chairs’ decision is in fact quite balanced.” and “But I consider (and I believe that others in the group do as well) that plainly ignoring this recommendation from the director amounts to painting a target on our back.”</p>



<p>Not once did Brent, Dan, or Pierre-Antoine acknowledge the merit of the concerns and attempt to find other means to address them.</p>



<p>PR #29 Remove mention of DID Methods from the charter was ostensibly created to seek input from the WG on the simplest alternative to #27. Unfortunately, not only did the chairs fail to make any comments on that PR, there remain four (4) outstanding change requests from TallTed, kdenhartog, Sakurann, and myself. This PR was never more than a distraction to appear magnanimous without any actual intention to discover a better proposal. If the chairs had been actually exploring PR #29 as a legitimate alternative to PR #27, they would have engaged in the conversation at a minimum, and at best, actually incorporated the suggested changes so the group could reasonably compare and discuss the merits of each approach.</p>



<p>PR #30 Charter for the DID Resolution WG was created in response to a request from TallTed, and initially supported by Brent Zundel, only to see him reverse course when he understood it was an alternative proposal to the DID WG Charter: “I do not support that course of action. … the place to [propose an alternative] is not here.”</p>



<p>Not once, at any time, did Brent, Pierre-Antoine, or Dan Burnett acknowledge the merit of our concerns. They did not ask objectors how else their concerns might be addressed. Not once did they attempt to address my (and others’) concerns about DID method over-centralization caused by putting DID Methods in scope.</p>



<p>Instead, they simply refused to engage objectors regarding their legitimate matters of concern. There were no new proposals from the chairs. There were no inquiries about the “real motivation” behind our objections in an effort to understand the technical arguments. There weren’t even rebuttals from leadership to the technical arguments made in opposition to DID Methods being in scope. It was clear from ALL of their correspondence that they simply expected that the rest of the WG would defer to their judgment because of the prior Director’s comments.</p>



<p>It is our opinion that in all their actions as chairs, WG Chairs MUST seek consensus, whether it is a WG deliverable, a charter, or any W3C matter. That’s the point of the W3C. If chairs can ignore process, what good is process? If staff can ignore the process, how are we to trust the integrity of the organization?</p>



<p>Finally, on the matter of the chairs and process, I find Brent Zundel’s assertion in the August presentation to the Credentials Community Group particularly problematic: “In my experience, Formal Objections are noted and are usually overridden”.</p>



<p>In other words, Brent believes that the Process, which describes in great detail what is to happen in response to a Formal Objection, doesn’t usually apply.</p>



<p>The fact is, he may end up being right. Given the improper dismissal of my appeal, the Process, in fact, does not appear to matter when it comes to the DID WG charter.</p>



 



 TECHNICAL FUNDAMENTALS 



<p>The primary technical objection to putting DID Methods in scope is simple conflict of interest. By empowering the DID WG to develop specific DID Methods, it would result in the group picking winners and losers among the 180+ DID Methods currently known. Not only would that give those methods an unfair advantage in the marketplace, it would affect WG deliberations in two important ways. First, the working group would, by necessity, need to learn those selected methods, placing a massive burden on participants, and elevating the techniques of that particular method to accepted canon–which will inevitably taint the DID Core specification with details based on those techniques. Second, this will require the group to evaluate, debate, and select one or a few of those 180+ methods, which will suck up the available time and energy of the working group, forcing them to work on “other people’s methods” rather than advancing the collective work that all DID Methods depend on. Those who want to pursue DID Methods at theW3C should propose their own charter based on a specific DID method.</p>



<p>Our second technical objection is more prosaic: there are no DID Methods ready for W3C standardization, as evidenced by the blank check in the current charter request. It may be within the bounds of the W3C process to authorize such an open ended deliverable, but we believe it is a fundamental problem that the chairs cannot even recommend a specific method for inclusion in the charter. Frankly, this weird hack of not specifying the method and restricting that work to First Public Working Draft (FPWD) status lacks integrity. If it is important for the group to develop a method, name it and make it fully standards track, without restriction. This middle-way is a false compromise that will satisfy no one.</p>



 INTEROPERABILITY GOALS  



<p>A significant failing of the initial DID Core specification was a failure to develop interoperability between DID Methods. This lack of interoperability was cited as a reason for multiple Formal Objections to that specification. We concur, it’s problem. </p>



<p>However, the problem was not a result of too many DID Methods, nor would it be resolved by forcing the standardization of one or more exemplars. It was a problem of scope. DID core was not allowed to pursue protocols and resolution was intentionally restricted to a mere “contract” rather than a full specification. </p>



<p>The result of those restrictions meant the WG could NOT achieve the kind of interoperability we are all seeking.</p>



<p>We believe the answer is simple: standardize DID Resolution. Not restricted to FPWD status, but actually create a normative global standard for DID Resolution as a W3C Recommendation.</p>



<p>By defining a common API that all DID Methods can implement to provide an interface for a back-end verifiable data registry, we allow any system that can support those implementations an equal opportunity to interoperate with any other, just like HTTP allows any browser to reach any website, regardless of the back-end technology that does the heavy lifting. </p>



<p>That’s how we get to interoperability.</p>



<p>Distracting the group with DID Method specifications would just limit the time and resources the DID WG can bring to bear on solving the real issue of interoperability between methods.</p>



<p>More technical and interoperability details are discussed in our <a href="https://blog.joeandrieu.com/2023/04/12/fighting-for-consensus-at-the-w3c/">appeal</a>.</p>



 RESPONDING TO CRITISMS  



<p>Finally, for those still reading, I’d like to address some criticisms that have been raised about my approach to this problem.</p>



<p>First, the assertion that this debate is going to end up in AC Review, so we should have it there and not in the WG.</p>



<p>The debate was not predestined to go to AC review. Like all objections under Process 2023, it should have been resolved in a council. Staff inappropriately accelerated the charter to AC Review despite an ongoing objection and requests by the objector to delay advancement until the matter could be resolved.</p>



<p>Second, the AC is not the appropriate place for a working group to work out its internal disagreements. The AC is the place where other member organizations have a chance to review and comment on proposed work done by the organization as a whole. This is a fundamental principle that, in other contexts, is known as federalism. It isn’t the job of the AC to tell every WG what to do. It’s the job of the AC to vet and confirm the work actually done by the WG. For staff and chairs to deny due process to my objection is, in fact, denying the ability for the AC to review the best proposal from the Working Group and instead requiring the AC to have a meaningless debate that will absolutely result in a council.</p>



<p>To reflect Philippe’s argument back, since the underlying objection is going to be decided in a council anyway, why didn’t we start there? Especially since that is what process requires.</p>



<p>Third, Philippe quoted the following Process section in his discussion of my appeal, despite ignoring the first part of the sentence.</p>



<blockquote><p>“When the Chair believes that the Group has duly considered the legitimate concerns of dissenters as far as is possible and reasonable, the group SHOULD move on.” [emphasis mine]</p></blockquote>



<p>The group did NOT duly consider the legitimate concerns of objectors. Instead, the chairs intentionally avoiding any substantive discussion on the topic. There is no evidence at all that the chairs ever considered the legitimate concerns of objectors. They dismissed them, ignored them, and argued that the WG’s github is not the place to have this debate, the AC is.</p>



<p>So, because Staff and the chairs believed it was ultimately going to AC Review, they collectively decided to ignore their obligations: of Chairs to seek consensus within the WG and of Staff to seek consensus through a W3C Council after my appeal.</p>



<p>Finally, I’ll note that my disagreement has been described by one of the chairs as “Vociferous”, “Haranging”, and “Attacking”. I find this characterization to be inappropriate and itself a CEPC failure. “When conflicts arise, we are expected to resolve them maintaining that courtesy, respect, and dignity, even when emotions are heightened.”</p>



<p>The civil exercise of one’s right to challenge authority is fundamental to a free society and vital to any collaborative institution. To be attacked because I chose to engage in conversations that the chairs were trying to avoid, is inappropriate. To be attacked because I filed an appeal, as clearly allowed in the Process, is inappropriate. To attack those who disagree with you is neither collaborative, nor is it an effective mechanism to seek consensus.</p>



 SUMMARY 



<p>This charter never should have made it to the AC. It unfairly hijacks the DID WG name and its work, without the consent of the current DID WG. Worse, it does so in a way that fundamentally undermines the decentralized nature of Decentralized Identifiers. </p>



<p>This charter should be rejected and returned to the DID WG to find a proposal with weaker objections, one that represents the collective will of the working group and legitimately continues the work in which we all have invested our professional careers.</p>

 SAML 2.0 Holder-of-Key Assertion Profile – Not exactly OAuth 
 OAuth 1.0 used PoP – But message signing too complicated 
 OAuth 2.0 MAC draft – Used similarly complicated signing 
 OAuth 2.0 HTTP Signing draft – Abandoned due to complexity

<p>I’ve had two different IETF specifications adopted by two different working groups in the last two days – a pleasant coincidence!  Yesterday, the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-cose-typ-header-parameter-00.html">COSE “typ” (type) Header Parameter</a> specification was adopted by the COSE working group.  Today, the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-resource-metadata-00.html">OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata</a> specification was adopted by the OAuth working group.  Their journeys from individual drafts to working group drafts couldn’t have been more different!</p>
<p>As I was musing with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/phunt/">Phil Hunt</a>, who wrote the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-jones-oauth-resource-metadata-00">original individual draft of OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata</a> with me, I’m pretty sure that this is the longest time from writing an individual draft to it becoming a <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-resource-metadata-00.html">working group draft</a> in my experience:  August 3, 2016 to September 6, 2023 – seven years and a month!</p>
<p>Whereas, the time from the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-jones-cose-typ-header-parameter-00.html">individual draft of COSE “typ” (type) Header Parameter</a> to the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-cose-typ-header-parameter-00.html">first working group draft</a> was only three months:  July 8, 2023 to September 5, 2023.  Which got me thinking…  Is that the fastest progression I’ve had?</p>
<p>It turns out that my fastest time from individual draft to working group draft was for the JWK Thumbprint URI specification which I wrote with <a href="https://twitter.com/kristinayasuda">Kristina Yasuda</a>.  It went from <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-jones-oauth-jwk-thumbprint-uri-00.html">individual draft</a> to <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-jwk-thumbprint-uri-00.html">working group draft</a> in only two months:  November 24, 2021 to January 28, 2022.  (And it became <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9278.html">RFC 9278</a> on August 9, 2022 – less than nine months from start to finish, which I believe is also a personal record.)</p>
<p>Ironically, while OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata took over seven years from individual to working group drafts, a closely-related draft, OAuth 2.0 Discovery (which became <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8414.html">RFC 8414</a>) was previously my fastest from <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-jones-oauth-discovery-00.html">individual draft</a> to <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-discovery-00.html">working group draft</a>: 2.5 months!  (The journey to becoming an RFC took 2.5 years.)</p>
<p>The other relative speed demon was Proof-Of-Possession Semantics for JSON Web Tokens (JWTs): 3.5 months from <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-jones-oauth-proof-of-possession-00.html">individual draft</a> to <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-proof-of-possession-00.html">working group draft</a> and two years from start to <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7800.html">RFC 7800</a>.</p>
 
<p>What are my takeaways from all these musings about starting things?</p>
 
 Starting things is something to celebrate.  It’s a creative process to go from an idea to something concrete and useful.  But as my COSE co-chair <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivaylo-petrov-a0b17241/">Ivaylo Petrov</a> wrote, “We would also like to remind you that adoption does not mean a document is finished, only that it is an acceptable starting point.” 
 Perseverance is essential.  Progressing things can take dedication and persistence.  My most-referenced specification, <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519.html">JSON Web Token (JWT) – RFC 7519</a>, <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/person/michael_b_jones@hotmail.com">referenced from 45 RFCs</a>, <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=1387">took 4.5 years</a>. 
 Focused specifications that do one thing well can progress quickly.  <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7800.html">Proof-Of-Possession Semantics for JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) – RFC 7800</a> and <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9278.html">JWK Thumbprint URI – RFC 9278</a> are prime examples.  I’m hoping that <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-cose-typ-header-parameter-00.html">COSE “typ” (type) Header Parameter</a> will be one of these – a sentiment I shared with co-author <a href="https://twitter.com/OR13b">Orie Steele</a>. 
 Finishing things matters.  That speaks for itself, but it’s sometimes easier said than done.  Finished things get used!

<p>While I usually reserve my time and energy for advancing good ideas, I’m making an exception to publicly state the reasons why I believe “<a href="https://github.com/msporny/charter-ietf-multiformats/">multiformats</a>” should not be considered for standardization by the IETF.</p>
<p>1. Multiformats institutionalize the failure to make a choice, which is the opposite of what good standards do.  Good standards make choices about representations of data structures resulting in interoperability, since every conforming implementation uses the same representation.  In contrast, multiformats enable different implementations to use a multiplicity of different representations for the same data, harming interoperability.  <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-multiformats-multibase-03#appendix-D.1">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-multiformats-multibase-03#appendix-D.1</a> defines 23 equivalent and non-interoperable representations for the same data!</p>
<p>2. The stated purpose of “<a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-multiformats-multibase-08.html">multibase</a>” is “Unfortunately, it’s not always clear what base encoding is used; that’s where this specification comes in. It answers the question: Given data ‘d’ encoded into text ‘s’, what base is it encoded with?”, which is wholly unnecessary.  Successful standards DEFINE what encoding is used where.  For instance, https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7518.html#section-6.2.1.2 defines that “x” is base64url encoded.  No guesswork or prefixing is necessary or useful.</p>
<p>3. Standardization of multiformats would result in unnecessary and unhelpful duplication of functionality – especially of key representations.  The primary use of multiformats is for “publicKeyMultibase” – a representation of public keys that are byte arrays.  For instance, the only use of multiformats by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">W3C DID spec</a> is for publicKeyMultibase.  The IETF already has several perfectly good key representations, including X.509, JSON Web Key (JWK), and COSE_Key.  There’s not a compelling case for another one.</p>
<p>4. publicKeyMultibase can only represent a subset of the key types used in practice.  Representing many kinds of keys requires multiple values – for instance, RSA keys require both an exponent and a modulus.  By comparison, the X.509, JWK, and COSE_Key formats are flexible enough to represent all kinds of keys.  It makes little to no sense to standardize a key format that limits implementations to only certain kinds of keys.</p>
<p>5. The “<a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-multiformats-multihash-07.html">multihash</a>” specification relies on a non-standard representation of integers called “Dwarf”.  Indeed, the referenced Dwarf document lists itself as being at http://dwarf.freestandards.org/ – a URL that no longer exists!</p>
<p>6. The “Multihash Identifier Registry” at <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-multiformats-multihash-07.html#mh-registry">https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-multiformats-multihash-07.html#mh-registry</a> duplicates the functionality of the IANA “Named Information Hash Algorithm Registry” at <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/named-information/named-information.xhtml#hash-alg">https://www.iana.org/assignments/named-information/named-information.xhtml#hash-alg</a>, in that both assign (different) numeric identifiers for hash functions.  If multihash goes forward, it should use the existing registry.</p>
<p>7.  It’s concerning that <a href="https://msporny.github.io/charter-ietf-multiformats/">the draft charter</a> states that “Changing current Multiformat header assignments in a way that breaks backward compatibility with production deployments” is out of scope.  Normally IETF working groups are given free rein to make improvements during the standardization process.</p>
<p>8. Finally, as a member of the W3C DID and W3C Verifiable Credentials working groups, I will state that it is misleading for the draft charter to say that “The outputs from this Working Group are currently being used by … the W3C Verifiable Credentials Working Group, W3C Decentralized Identifiers Working Group…”.  The documents produced by these working groups intentionally contain no normative references to multiformats or any data structures derived from them.  Where they are referenced, it is explicitly stated that the references are non-normative.</p>

<p>Well, this is a big one for the identity industry. Two stalwarts becoming one.</p>

<p>As someone who was there and in the thick of it during the last big merger of identity players, I wish all my (too many to tag) friends at ForgeRock and Ping Identity all the best, good luck, and a strong stomach. </p>



<p>Combining two product suites that have this much history and strength isn’t easy. There will be difficult decisions and even more difficult conversations ahead. The key is to have strong leadership with a clear vision for the future and a relentless commitment to helping your customers. Few would be up to that task, but Andre Durand is one of the few in this world who could.</p>



<p>Cheers to all of you, buckle up, and enjoy the ride!</p>

<p>This is the first of (I hope) numerous posts that I hope to write for tomi, where I’ll share my journey as the Project Manager for the first phase of specification writing for the tomiDAO. Actually, I wrote a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pVEuI6YgrWDYC4F0LIKwaehhGIlDbAT19N_GBiPK6V4/edit">summary of my Metafest experience</a> representing tomi, and I’ll have more to say about that later. But first, I want to start out with a quick introduction of why I’ve decided to devote my time to this project (other than that they’re paying me) and why you should join me (because they’ll pay you too, and I can’t do it&nbsp;alone).</p><p>For those of you who don’t know me, you might want to check out my work at <a href="http://www.daoleadership.com/">www.daoleadership.com</a> or my general everything website <a href="http://www.gracerachmany.com/">www.gracerachmany.com</a>. For those of you who do know me, you probably think of me as a contrarian who has been in the DAO space for half a decade, but I’ve never strongly associated myself with one project. So why has tomi captured so much of my time and attention?</p><p>I first came into contact with tomi when they were writing their whitepaper in September 2022. I knew nobody’s names, but from the outset it was clear that the team is serious about creating an alternative to the censored World Wide Web. But it was also obvious that most of them had no experience with public goods or the commons. Fortunately, around that time, they brought on DAOwl who explained to them that it would be impossible to expect a traditional DAO to set and enforce content moderation policies. “Hoo would want to look at the world’s most obscene content every day?” asked DAOwl. But that was just the start of the rabbit&nbsp;hole.</p> Who are these tomi people? (Spoiler, I don’t&nbsp;know.) <p>Every now and again, DAOwl would ask me about some particular part of DAO tooling. What did I think about JokeDAO for ranked voting? What did I think about copyright violations? The conversations were always interesting and insightful. But let’s face it, the tomiDAO itself is a simple yes/no voting mechanism for distributing a pot of tokens. I wasn’t impressed at all until <a href="https://twitter.com/DrNickA">Dr. Nick</a> said to me that this was one of the first DAOs he’d heard of with a working NFT voting implementation. “I’ve been talking about NFT voting for a while,” he said, “but this is the first time I’ve seen it working on a real project.” So it turns out the tomi team had pulled off something innovative after&nbsp;all.</p><p>Look, I’m a skeptic. I’ve been in the Web3 space for 5 years. Heck, I’ve been in tech for 35 years. It’s always a good bet that a project will fail, I say, because 98% of them&nbsp;do.</p><p>In January, the tomi team asked me to set up a panel for them to discuss the DAO. DAOwl says they refuses to show in person, so they asked me to moderate and bring in the panelists, and fortunately I got the wonderful Daniel Ospina from RnDAO, Esther Galfalvi from SingularityNET DAO, and Evin McMullen from Disco.xyz, and we had a fabulous time in Marrakesh, including an ATV tour and a hotel with a fabulous&nbsp;spa.</p><p>Most importantly, I finally got to meet the tomi team — and some of them even used real names! Apparently the video footage was great, but the videographer didn’t know it was illegal to fly a drone over the fancy hotel where the event was held, and now he and all the footage are in jail. You can’t make this stuff&nbsp;up!</p> Privacy is rapidly becoming&nbsp;illegal <p>Which brings us to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-charges-two-founders-sanctioned-virtual-currency-mixer-tornado-cash-with-2023-08-23/">Tornado Cash</a> and the way in which privacy is under attack by governments worldwide. If you join the tomi Discord or the tomiArmy, it might seem a bit sketchy. Like another one of those “wen moon projects”, but…</p><p>Boy, am I sick of open-source revolutionaries with no funds and no marketing and great code that nobody can use. How are underfunded projects like <a href="https://handshake.org/">Handshake</a> ever going to take off? They even call themselves an “experiment”. How are we going to have censorship resistance when <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/10/14/censored-ethereum-blocks-hit-the-51-threshold-over-the-past-24-hours/">most of the Ethereum nodes are hosted in countries that have made privacy illegal</a>? How are we going to have public goods when VCs own a big chunk of the&nbsp;project?</p><p>The tomi founders, apparently 8 of them, have put their money where their heart is. From what I could surmise from the amount of working code they’ve released, and from the first “Nakamoto Forum”, as they called their conference in Marrakesh, they are a bunch of successful crypto founders who have invested their own money (and a lot of it) to lift this project off the ground. When they launched the token, they simultaneously released the DAO, a testnet browser, an NFT collection, and hardware nodes. Since then, they’ve launched (and spun off) a privacy layer, a DNS NFT auction and marketplace, a marketing “army”, and a staking&nbsp;pool.</p><p>Another reason I was impressed with tomi is that they are committed to usability for everyone. The tomiNET is going to be accessible through a normal browser with normal URLs. It’s about time Web3 started to produce something that actually solves a problem for “normies”. So far, everything I’ve seen from tomi points to them making their interfaces intuitive and offering products that can be used without needing blockchain expertise. (Other than storing your private keys, and I expect MPC to solve that in the next&nbsp;year.)</p><p>The product team just seems to spew out product after product. Are these products ready for mainstream use? Not at all. Why are the founders putting in so much time and effort? Maybe they want to keep their money private. Or maybe they’ve made enough money that they figure it’s time to give back to the community. Maybe they are putting it in a DAO to avoid legal liability. Who&nbsp;knows?</p><p>Here’s what I do know. These guys are absolutely serious about building products and they are absolutely serious about empowering the community through the DAO. They just don’t know how. Neither do I, come to think of&nbsp;it.</p> Cold start <p>When tomi asked me to represent them at Metafest, I took up the challenge because, as I said, I think privacy is everyone’s right, and this is the first time I’ve seen such a comprehensive and well-funded project come together. I think that tomi is right that having a native cryptocurrency and governing DAO is necessary for the project’s success.</p><p>One of the main takeaways from Metafest was how hard it is to go from cold start (nobody) to a functioning DAO. The DAO is now made up of approximately 500 wallets of tomi Pioneers who purchased the initial NFTs granting them voting rights. In other words, they are the investors in the project, not the users. The tomi team is aware that this should change gradually over time — but they want experts and aligned people to join, which is why they invited me and why I’m inviting you, but it’s still hard. They probably need at least 5 different teams to run these DAOs, and theoretically, the teams should be made up of people all over the world who want an alternative WWW. But right now it’s you, me, and our friends. Meaning that a cold start DAO is not&nbsp;easy.</p> The tomi opportunity <p>When I accepted the challenge to approach the tomiDAO specifications documentation, there were two aspects that impressed me. First of all, they asked me to seek out multiple providers for the specifications. I’ll say more about that below, but in the end, they weren’t satisfied with any of the proposals, and they ended up <a href="https://dao.tomi.com/proposal/16">writing their own</a>, which combined elements from two existing proposals while also incorporating several of their own unique innovations. DAOwl said: no offense, I want to work with all the people who made proposals, but we will work on our terms until there is a solid and trusted team that can take over the&nbsp;project.</p><p>Even more promising, they recently approved the specification for a self-sovereign identity wallet integrated into their crypto wallet. The winner of the proposal, <a href="https://walt.id/">walt.id</a>, also wrote a <a href="https://dao.tomi.com/proposal/12">very impressive DAO proposal</a> and they are highly respected in the SSI industry. I didn’t know them before tomi, but their credentials checked out and it’s all open source, which I think is important. This shows me that the team has really gone down to the fundamentals of what has caused the WWW to become centralized and exploitative, and they are interested in integrating the essential components that give the project potential to actually transform the internet back into a place where people can have freedom of expression, including freedom to dissent and freedom to develop connections and commerce with anyone, anywhere.</p> Challenges for the DAO industry as a&nbsp;whole <p>Another exciting aspect of tomi is that they are grappling with specific instances of generalized problems. Everyone from X (formerly twitter), through Lens Protocol and Handshake, to ENS is dealing with the problems of naming and/or the problem of content moderation. DAO tooling is completely inadequate to touch any of these processes. And frankly, I’m frustrated with DAO solutions looking for problems. I want to start designing a solution based on a specific challenge, and tomi has plenty of&nbsp;them.</p><p>What tomi is trying to do is going to put them up against tremendous challenges. Some of them are straightforward, like the fact that the default language of tomi is English, but that’s probably not the default language of the people who are being oppressed and need an alternative internet. Other problems are more complex, such as preventing spam and denial of service attacks from rendering the network useless. Some are legal, for example, if tomi succeeds and its domain name system becomes the one everyone wants to use, they may open themselves up to lawsuits from everyone, from celebrities to corporations and governments.</p><p>But even if tomi doesn’t manage to complete its entire vision, the DAO tooling we can create together will resonate throughout Web3. DAOs for content moderation, DAOs for name services, DAOs for strategy-building, Verifiable Credentials and DIDs for DAOs, reputation for DAOS, accountability for fulfilling DAO proposals… All of these are part of tomi’s agenda for the next year’s planning.</p><p>And tomi has the budget to pull this off. The DAO is currently funded with an initial amount equivalent to $20 Million. According to what DAOwl told me, a portion of all the tomi domain name sales will continue to feed into the DAO. And it will be up to the DAO itself to create the business models on top of tomi that will allow it to be self-sustaining. Any one of the tools that I mentioned above could be implemented in dozens of DAOs today. So the suite of DAO tools could represent a comprehensive starter kit for just about any project. And best of all for me, I get the chance to demonstrate how communities can develop tools that are more collaborative and complex than simple yes-no and ranked&nbsp;voting.</p> Get on board: tomi needs&nbsp;you <p>One of the conditions I set for tomi was that, given the fact that there is a budget, we should not expect people to work for free and/or campaign to join. DAOwl said this was fine, but that they expect accountability for producing the work that is needed for the DAOs. Sometimes I think this is an emergent phenomenon: DAOs with limited funds waste a lot of time on meetings and give out little bounties that get distributed in a “nice” way where everyone gets something regardless of talent. In other words, many DAOs have been prioritizing inclusion over execution, partially because they can’t really afford highly professional work.</p><p>The first step that we’re taking is to create the DAO specifications. Together we <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a_EmXwsnQM0jQMaty72Ez3v316cqRKckVAIwEPhvX4o/edit">wrote this plan</a> and DAOwl and tomi’s CTO, Camel, have approved it. My goal is to include as many people as possible in the discussions, with those contributing significant time being compensated reasonably. In other words, if you are qualified, apply, and you’ll be paid for your work. This isn’t short-term either. Once the specifications are done, we need to actually staff these DAOs. It looks like there will be a dozen different processes and committees needed for the initial launch in May&nbsp;2024.</p><p>To get involved, join the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/tomi">tomi Discord</a> server and introduce yourself on the DAO channels. DAOwl and myself will be monitoring and welcoming people. Announcements will be made of the times and places of the discussions, and you’ll be able to join and participate in various&nbsp;ways.</p><p>Those of you who know me are aware that for the last 3 years I’ve been blathering on about how we are going to need a parallel network of passports, network infrastructure, and commerce because the authorities are becoming increasingly authoritarian worldwide. Although I’m mostly vegetarian, I wouldn’t want a world authority telling me I must be vegan and enforcing it through their CBDCs and supply chains. What tomi is providing can be an essential set of tools for those of us who want our freedom and are willing to pay the&nbsp;price.</p> How (not) to impress the tomi free&nbsp;birds <p>I’ve teamed up with my buddy <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/moritzbierling/">Moritz Bierling</a> to put together this project and we want you to join if you care about internet freedom or about the development of DAO&nbsp;tooling.</p><p>It’s a well-known secret that I spent a lot of years in fairly corporate environments and that I believe in some of the more structured ways of getting things done. So when tomi asked me to do this work, I said we should at least get three proposals and not just hire me because they know me. They said: ok, go ahead. But I&nbsp;failed.</p><p>I failed because most of the DAO experts are&nbsp;either:</p>  Super busy on multiple&nbsp;projects  More interested in promoting/integrating their technology than joining someone else’s&nbsp;projects  Inexperienced when it comes to presenting themselves to a&nbsp;client  More interested in having intellectual and cool conversations than getting stuff&nbsp;done  <p>DAOwl told me several people ghosted them, joined the Discord but didn’t follow the comments even when they were mentioned, promised to submit proposals and then disappeared, failed to invoice for work done, and needed multiple reminders of things they agreed to. In other words, they seemed to Owl to be discourteous (as if they were doing tomi a&nbsp;favour).</p><p>I won’t lie. I was embarrassed. I gave the names of several people I respected and I felt it reflected poorly on me when tomi didn’t get responses. Some people told me explicitly that they were uncomfortable with the tomi project and wouldn’t join because it seemed to “scammy”. I respect that, just as I respect the whole Gitcoin-Shell conversation. But I don’t respect it when my client is ignored, has to chase people down, or receives empty promises.</p><p>So if you do want to impress myself and DAOwl, please take a few simple&nbsp;steps:</p>  Do what you said you would do. If you say you’ll send a proposal or join the Discord channel, do&nbsp;it.  Be interested. If you write something on the Discord, check at least once to see what happened or answer&nbsp;DMs.  If you want to get paid for your work, take appropriate steps. Send a price proposal if appropriate. Make your payment terms known in advance. Send an invoice or at least an ETH address to the DAOwl or myself when you complete&nbsp;work.  Be proactive. For the DAO to function, we all need to take responsibility. If I have to remind people of what they promised and micromanage when people post to the Discord, it’s not a DAO. If you think we should be using Wonderverse or Jira or any of that, say so and be the one to initiate the project and ask to get paid for implementation.  Bring people in who need the work. Many of us are overwhelmed with work offers and sometimes we take it for granted. If this is not the project for you, or you don’t have the bandwidth, say so and find someone who does need the&nbsp;work.  Be courteous.  <p>Oh, and one more thing. If you can bring an equal number of men and women (or more women than men), that will be greatly appreciated. The specifications for the DAO discussions stipulate that all discussions require a minimum 40%&nbsp;women.</p> Let’s get decentralization right <p>We’ve all seen successful DAOs with multiple functioning sub-DAOs. The tomi project has the potential to provide infrastructure both for Web3 and for end users. My hope is that within 6 months there will be multiple project managers and team leads, and that this Medium blog will be filled with articles from the best of us discussing the solutions we’ve developed and the tradeoffs we’ve&nbsp;made.</p><p>So what are you waiting for? <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a_EmXwsnQM0jQMaty72Ez3v316cqRKckVAIwEPhvX4o/edit">Check out the plan</a>, and the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1OpYksmPAXGKSyvUmrQIzcaEdr3hQLif8v85_oKsUPwc/edit">Governance specifications workflow</a>, the next step is to <a href="https://discord.com/invite/tomi">introduce yourself on the tomi Discord channels</a>, under the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/983854078285201408/1144628687413723136">DAO channel</a> for introductions, and join us by helping us build a better World Wide&nbsp;Web.</p><p>See you&nbsp;there!</p><p>Follow us for the latest information:</p><p><a href="https://tomi.com/">Website</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/tomipioneers">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://discord.gg/tomi">Discord</a> | <a href="https://t.me/tomipioneers">Telegram Announcements</a> | <a href="https://t.me/tomi_official_chat">Telegram Chat</a> | <a href="https://tomipioneers.medium.com/">Medium</a> | <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tomipioneers/">Reddit</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tominetwork">TikTok</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/tomipioneers/why-i-took-on-the-tomi-challenge-and-you-should-too-dao-expert-opinion-bc60bc505bb7">Why I took on the tomi challenge and you should too: DAO expert opinion</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/tomipioneers">tomipioneers</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/OR13b">Orie Steele</a> and I have written a new specification creating algorithm identifiers for JOSE and COSE that fully specify the cryptographic operations to be performed – something we’d promised to do during <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/117/materials/slides-117-jose-fully-specified-algorithms-for-jose-and-cose-00">our presentation to the JOSE working group</a> at IETF 117.  The introduction to the specification (quoted below) describes why this matters.</p>
 
<p>The IANA algorithm registries for JOSE [<a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/jose/jose.xhtml#web-signature-encryption-algorithms">IANA.JOSE.Algorithms</a>] and COSE [<a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/cose/cose.xhtml#algorithms">IANA.COSE.Algorithms</a>] contain two kinds of algorithm identifiers:</p>
 
 Fully Specified: Those that fully determine the cryptographic operations to be performed, including any curve, key derivation function (KDF), hash functions, etc. Examples are <code>RS256</code> and <code>ES256K</code> in both JOSE and COSE and <code>ES256</code> in JOSE. 
 Polymorphic: Those requiring information beyond the algorithm identifier to determine the cryptographic operations to be performed. Such additional information could include the actual key value and a curve that it uses. Examples are <code>EdDSA</code> in both JOSE and COSE and <code>ES256</code> in COSE. 
 
<p>This matters because many protocols negotiate supported operations using only algorithm identifiers. For instance, OAuth Authorization Server Metadata [<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8414.html">RFC8414</a>] uses negotiation parameters like these (from an example in the specification):</p>
<p><code>"token_endpoint_auth_signing_alg_values_supported": ["RS256", "ES256"]</code></p>
<p>OpenID Connect Discovery [<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html">OpenID.Discovery</a>] likewise negotiates supported algorithms using <code>alg</code> and <code>enc</code> values. W3C Web Authentication [<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2021/REC-webauthn-2-20210408/">WebAuthn</a>] and FIDO Client to Authenticator Protocol (CTAP) [<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-v2.1-ps-20210615/fido-client-to-authenticator-protocol-v2.1-ps-20210615.html">FIDO2</a>] negotiate using COSE <code>alg</code> numbers.</p>
<p>This does not work for polymorphic algorithms. For instance, with <code>EdDSA</code>, you do not know which of the curves <code>Ed25519</code> and/or <code>Ed448</code> are supported! This causes real problems in practice.</p>
<p>WebAuthn contains this de-facto algorithm definition to work around this problem:</p>
<p><code>-8 (EdDSA), where crv is 6 (Ed25519)</code></p>
<p>This redefines the COSE <code>EdDSA</code> algorithm identifier for the purposes of WebAuthn to restrict it to using the <code>Ed25519</code> curve – making it non-polymorphic so that algorithm negotiation can succeed, but also effectively eliminating the possibility of using <code>Ed448</code>. Other similar workarounds for polymorphic algorithm identifiers are used in practice.</p>
<p>This specification creates fully-specified algorithm identifiers for all registered polymorphic JOSE and COSE algorithms and their parameters, enabling applications to use only fully-specified algorithm identifiers. It furthermore deprecates the practice of registering polymorphic algorithm identifiers.</p>
 
<p>The specification is available at:</p>

Websockets were running at home on port 3000, and this needs to be shifted over&nbsp; to port 80 to be on the same port as the HTTP server.<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgDAY_H01-nA2C4y10kS87ta_GgQJfR0-64fW_vrofIlKTxryVilowxGkHUTw8drbTFczt0dDpY_aPDCQ31arSLzmBlyl8usvq6GIr-0vx_vRM-OVYxe8Y6H3UVXzutP92BtxXf0ZNs4qK5awQOFzxW6twbr4UUKHoHDteDlcAcV_W5b_wIgo6V0YqDeuPC/s4608/DSC_0188.JPG"><br></a><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgDAY_H01-nA2C4y10kS87ta_GgQJfR0-64fW_vrofIlKTxryVilowxGkHUTw8drbTFczt0dDpY_aPDCQ31arSLzmBlyl8usvq6GIr-0vx_vRM-OVYxe8Y6H3UVXzutP92BtxXf0ZNs4qK5awQOFzxW6twbr4UUKHoHDteDlcAcV_W5b_wIgo6V0YqDeuPC/s4608/DSC_0188.JPG"></a><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgDAY_H01-nA2C4y10kS87ta_GgQJfR0-64fW_vrofIlKTxryVilowxGkHUTw8drbTFczt0dDpY_aPDCQ31arSLzmBlyl8usvq6GIr-0vx_vRM-OVYxe8Y6H3UVXzutP92BtxXf0ZNs4qK5awQOFzxW6twbr4UUKHoHDteDlcAcV_W5b_wIgo6V0YqDeuPC/s4608/DSC_0188.JPG"><br></a>Circle of people meeting for an unconference session<br>   <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgYdCZGFsBrhjAISFFQK1AEXWxNDj8iCTwK7oXjFkcniYhxWKCPKmepM_kcUIJB8BSdORMYP74T8XxviIx7BcsiE7T7seYur3DF4rKYi80Jub9k1ozlRpzLlQey95OvAEfRU16uxwGqna67Z4TdOYsh4yUZhtZpE60usoLBjzmVnl3VMX12j4i3o0q3z7HL/s4608/DSC_0194.JPG"></a>  Circle, perhaps closing, at the Internet Identity Workshop <br>   <br>Justin Richer, long time IIW veteran<br><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgYBZAJq9-naS1QVYnaItW_CZdeAUzGK6uyWE0lonTl-Mn5K5-b4ljA9Idq6-4OSkwsVy_1j_fvSLTW8AkuD_9Ef5J3azxuqAtHtCoZoPIVsJ5I68_8RzfacK-kDTn1vD1Om5yKsobCqptHwHveNBAtVfUdLjZlu7OrxofUDnWQbcE5_aVz4gLZAJTIrg4O/s4608/DSC_0253.JPG"><br></a>Pedestrian street in Mountain View, CA<br><br>Bar near the Computer History Museum<br><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhPDaRT6IpaTU-Ho5rOXJBVSbdiEsnIK15zLUJESLmD_X9Wyr50cVIwPOxfiRIh-TjrdZzJz6TBRWVLU7lysx1errzshk5hH3PvIyvaqrolNqnMZcO1W18N8_SEutws3W2jcZWT7PSVeIWBQGELSzV6quJy3DwfbrC_fyKwKnQmxgPQionlCXEVMpGAbETt/s4608/DSC_0258.JPG"></a><br>Caltrain leaving from Mountain View and headed toward San Jose, CA<br><br>Greyhound bus leaving to depart to Oklahoma City from San Jose<br><br>San Jose Diridon Transit Center that has the Greyhound ticket counter<br><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhfMu25gXvY8smY7t8czapD0MBJJ-X8ZKCp0jGmR-tncpdxxCx3mTa8naAEfTi2q9hBvmEPch20ADIE7ACE3yGyc1MYUXk6sFmuSEGYWlN6Px8pbeA_jZbubmoV_BS_pXfI4yTEO-Cr5ypKiGi-4RktgKnmrlsyyzeJIwM18a4z_Wv7JN37ju3ujPsW5s-7/s4608/DSC_0260.JPG"></a><br>Hilton Hotel room I stayed in because the Greyhound site would no longer acknowledge my ticket purchase, but the front desk at the Hilton would acknowledge my presence. I gambled with low phone power and lost when choosing talk to the bus driver instead of Greyhound's help hotline. With hindsight, since I called home before booking the Hilton explaining that I was afraid of the cold night and for my safety, I did have the phone power for both actions with Greyhound. Due to this and following experiences, I now own a backup battery charger. Also, I now prefer to fly due to less expensive tickets, zero cost cancellation fees, and generally better customer service. Yay to Southwest (although I'll sometimes mix it up). To Greyhound's credit though, I did get an updated ticket the next day with no penalty and for the same price as paid in July, 5 months before. <br><br>This might be Santa Barbara, CA<br><br>Perhaps this is a cactus at an Arizona rest stop in the higher desert a little while after leaving Phoenix, AZ?<br><br> In late February of 2023, I went to <a href="https://www.ethdenver.com/">EthDenver</a>. I really wasn't feeling like going after feeling financial strain, but Derrek the Community Steward gave me the encouragement to come. I do confess that I do spend money on : (1) travelling a lot looking for opportunity because I get a feeling of not fitting in and feel I am missing out, (2) buying a fair amount of electronics on AliExpress (and sometimes from HAM Radio people) trying to educate myself after wanting but not obtaining an electronics education earlier and within a comfortable budget. I probably should work more but I tend to be more productive and keep it together mentally when I pursue projects that I want to see in the world, rather than work with those who may not share my long term goals, interests, or beliefs.<br>Anyway, I ended up applying for the EthDenver Scholarship and the Antalpha Hackerhouse and was ultimately being accepted for both. I chose the Hackerhouse and it was generally a great experience except for being so far from the EthDenver venues that it would be hundreds of dollars in transportation fees if a car was not available. The quality of the people selected at the house was excellent as were the speakers. I got to meet Kostas Kryptos who worked on Meta's (formerly Facebook) Libra project as the lead cryptographer. I was lucky to have brought David Wong's book on Real World Cryptography because it brought joy to him (<a href="https://twitter.com/kostascrypto/status/1629722559783780352">https://twitter.com/kostascrypto/status/1629722559783780352</a>).

This was probably close to the time when I had a mental breakdown and received the unexpected comfort of one the house organizers. They told me, if I recall, that I just have to accept things and move forward and sometimes that means that things don't work out. They loved all my links about decentralized identity and my hardware work and were impressed that I completed a Masters in Chemical Engineering. I hadn't been that productive during my stay at the hackerhouse. I messed up on the first night of the hackathon. I stayed out too late trying to mend a relationship with someone who I had worked with previously at EthDenver and by chance ran into in the registration line and who helped me through it and made the mistake of going to a party on the way back that some from the hackerhouse, but not the core people who formed the team I missed out on, were at. The person I was trying to mend a relationship with chose to abandon me by the next morning because I mentioned in a text that morning that that I had talked about our project idea, even in the vaguest of forms I thought because I knew they were sensitive, to another hacker in the space and they were afraid of having their ideas stolen and were not open to working with others besides me. The next morning was too late as the team had materialized with one person arriving late at night just as I was finishing entertaining them. Ultimately this led me to project to others that I had already found a team and miss out on working as an official team member with the four member team that formed the first night. This of course did not hit home for me till the following morning. Like the game of musical chairs, I ended being the odd guy out and worked and struggled as a one member team. I also had some belief in my mind that some in the hackerhouse would 
rather work with some people smarter or more talented or something else, but it turned out they would have had me on their team and we sustained a healthy relationship. I could have traveled into the EthDenver hackerbase, but I chose instead to be beside Jason and EZKL. I tried running a model on ezkl and hastily trying to learn machine learning. Late in the game I gained a team member when another showed up, and some attempt was made. It turns out the model I was trying wouldn't have worked at the time? The later <a href="https://github.com/zkonduit/ezkl/discussions/164#discussioncomment-5886750">fix</a>. Ahh, hackathons. My coffee insomnia that struck during the first week, and following brain haze withdrawal didn't help my focus. But wow. People at the hackerhouse were smart, skilled, and dedicated. I'm blessed.<br><br>Also, I think this is important.

If it wasn't for the unexpected generosity of a friend, I probably would have decided it wasn't worth the risk to go. While there I got to meet the highly accomplished Brooklyn Zelenka whom I had interacted with months earlier on Twitter with the arrangement of Boris Mann. (comment: It turns out I had previously been at a techlahoma event, was it a mixer called OKCTech++?, where I ran into Lawrence Kincheloe ,a guy I first met at OhmSpace hackerspace in the later months of 2011, who asked a pertinent question about the Blinky Project, "What happens if you lose network connectivity?". This question unexpectedly led me to learn about UCANs which are object based access control tokens that require no network connectivity (<a href="https://ucan.xyz/">https://ucan.xyz/</a>). Too much untamed complexity, and I suppose delirum, has delayed me from trying UCANs with Blinky, but I can say now that the data payload may be too cumbersome for my hardware.)

My intention was to use it to host software projects for the workshop while my laptop (which has a very noisy fan) was shut down. If I recall correctly I may have been able to install the zome for <a href="https://github.com/h-REA/hREA">https://github.com/h-REA/hREA</a> but there was no version of HoloChain that was going to run on my architecture <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/quick-start/">https://developer.holochain.org/quick-start/</a> .

I'd like to introduce those from the FISSION community to the project to see if they may be able to enhance the activity. I may also seek out the Internet Identity Workshop community again and seek discussion about peer production and how identity would play a part. (Not to mention, I'm a co-chair with <a href="https://identity.foundation/interop/">https://identity.foundation/interop/</a> and IIW might be ideal to move interoperability efforts forward. It could help if I was a commercial builder and traveled to all of the identity events). Maybe it could be special kinds of verifiable credentials that help with connecting trusted parties for peer production. Since these verifiable credentials might be irregular, like <a href="http://adistributedeconomy.blogspot.com/2012/03/knowledge-discovery-with-semantic-web.html">http://adistributedeconomy.blogspot.com/2012/03/knowledge-discovery-with-semantic-web.html</a> mapping techniques mentioned in Benjamin Braatz paper might help. I also would like to finish the Blinky Project and apply it as a Sensorica project as Tibi suggested. Lastly, I cannot forget the laser and shift register projects with Arduino. These might lead to some pretty epic visualizations that could be synchronized to music, or rather driven by the sound itself!<br><br>If you'd like to help, feel free to reach out or donate. I think for IIW alone, I need to pull in between $400 to $800. If Sam came, this could be more. A couch to crash on would be worth at least $200. Alternatively, or in addition, I could try busking. I already translated a tune to sheet music from audio that I came up with using <a href="https://www.lunaverus.com/">AnthemScore</a>:<br><br><br>  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiBL5j8vRnp6c2xrQCh38Gq2bhn0PEuU9gHozkUO8MRklf3x2AvQg8u3H_ST83jkB_8cpjnZtoBvDL5ggWgnaRwLD1WmEv3FZClJEcx5AxHngyB_NozbM2pkamh4q3_scs1h96XG_ncCa_bN7rmFJg4Iijo7GpMMZNtX3XXBOzFbvPfi9DyWSspFmHdHKNo/s3508/NR24print.png"></a> <br><br> <br><br><br>

 The kind organizations will&nbsp;require. <p>The current Verifiable Credentials (VCs) data model <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/WD-verifiable-claims-data-model-20170803/">originated in 2017</a>, when it was called “Verifiable Claims”. There have been many sustaining innovations since that time but none disruptive¹ until now, for a new field of application for VCs: Organizational Identity&nbsp;(OI).</p><p>In <a href="https://rufftimo.medium.com/the-dawn-of-decentralized-organizational-identity-part-2-organizational-credentials-d8baf5fd9114">The Dawn of Organizational Identity, Part 2: Credentials</a>, Stephan Wolf, GLEIF’s CEO and the piece’s co-author, and I introduced what we consider to be second-generation VCs. We made the case why they’re ideally suited for Organizational Credentials (OCs), and why they’re required for many, if not most, of the use cases for organizations.</p><p>That argument is reproduced here, along with a few additions and modifications, as second-generation VCs represent an important advancement in verifiable credentials generally, separate from and in addition to their importance for OI and&nbsp;OCs.</p> Second-Generation Verifiable Credentials <p>First-generation VCs, like the current VC JSON-LD standard at W3C or the emerging JWT standard at IETF, were developed with utility for individuals in mind, for proving things like identity, age, and academic credentials. They were and are a major breakthrough in digital identity, they’re what make ‘self-sovereign identity’ actually self-sovereign and ‘decentralized identity’ actually decentralized, by giving individuals a high degree of digital autonomy for the first&nbsp;time.</p><p>Second-generation VCs were developed with organizational use cases in mind, with all the capabilities of first-generation credentials plus sophisticated new capabilities that individuals don’t often need but organizations typically do, such as key rotation and recovery, delegability, multi-signature (“multi-sig”), contractually protected disclosure, freedom from blockchain/‘ledger lock’, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>These new organizational capabilities are made possible by a form of VCs called “Authentic Chained Data Containers” (<a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ssmith-acdc-02.html">ACDCs</a>), with signing and verification using an open key management protocol that replaces the need for blockchain or vulnerable web-based security: Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (<a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/ietf-keri">KERI</a>). These two decentralizing protocols together — ACDCs for VCs and KERI for signing — deliver significant advances for VCs, the kind that organizations require and that justify the ‘second-generation’ moniker.</p><p>Here are seven highlights:</p><p>1. Extraordinary advances in security:</p>  Recovery from private key compromise (suspected or actual) without reissuance of previously signed&nbsp;items*  Key rotation without re-issuance of previously signed&nbsp;items*  No reliance on web&nbsp;security  Privacy-respecting verifiable revocation  Non-repudiable signing with&nbsp;logging  Post-quantum proof*  Natively supports weighted ‘m-of-n’ multi-sig schemes with fractionally weighted thresholds (e.g., 2-of-3’, or 1-of-3 when the 1 has sufficient ‘weight’, etc.)  <p>2. No reliance on blockchain (and its limitations: “ledger-lock”/centralization, scalability, cost, complexity, interoperability, performance, privacy, security, etc.)</p><p>3. Use of existing cloud infrastructure and&nbsp;APIs</p><p>4. Multi-level issuance with chaining and delegation (anyone having authority can delegate and extend a chain of authority, rather than all delegates returning to the ‘mother ship’ for single-level, single-signer issuance)</p><p>5. Extraordinary advances in privacy with graduated disclosure (granular, legally enforceable privacy and disclosure capabilities, covered in greater detail later in this article):</p>  Selective disclosure (with or without Zero Knowledge Proofs)*  <a href="https://iang.org/papers/ricardian_contract.html">Ricardian Contract</a> capabilities through contractually protected disclosure (counterparties verifiably consent to terms of disclosure prior to disclosure)  Contingent disclosure (i.e., escrowed)  <p>6. Interoperable with anything using the same underlying protocols (without sharing blockchains, vendors, registries, databases, etc.)</p><p>7. Simpler; technically lighter-weight (not verbose, compared to first-gen VCs)</p><p>*Individuals need these,&nbsp;too.</p> Security First,&nbsp;Always <p>With second-generation VCs, security comes first, always, no exceptions. The security advances with second-generation VCs are stunning when you consider that key recovery and rotation are still the Achilles Heel not only of first generation VCs, but also of blockchain and existing web infrastructure generally. Second-generation VCs using KERI don’t just fix <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/VC_Enhancement_Strategy.md">security flaws for VCs</a> (especially web-based VCs), they’re a significant advance in digital security, period.</p> Come on In, the Water’s&nbsp;Warm <p>There are no significant technical reasons we are aware of not to advance to second-generation VCs — no notable trade-offs other than familiarity and switching costs from legacy systems. In fact, the complexity of blockchain-based first-generation VCs may be at least an order of magnitude greater than the more elegant, advanced, and blockchain-less second-generation VCs.</p><p>That said, some will reasonably argue that a second-generation of VCs that doesn’t directly and fully interoperate with first-generation VCs — which is true — is a step backward rather than forward. However, we feel that achieving interoperability of VCs that are insecure, reliant on blockchain or web infrastructure, and not stress tested in production at scale is a hollow victory and premature; it is not meaningful interoperability. Security — in the form of proper key management — must come first, it cannot be bolted onto the current VC model just like it cannot be bolted onto the internet after the fact. There is no way around&nbsp;this.</p><p>However, the good news is, with second-generation VCs we can have all the robust security capabilities described above plus <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/SPAC_Message.md">advances in privacy</a> simply not possible with first-generation VCs, and gain real, global, fully decentralized interoperability that only standardized non-platform-based protocols can deliver. Even then, serious work on interoperability should be undertaken only after some use cases have made it into production and demonstrated that all these things work well, at scale. Otherwise that would be premature interoperability, too.</p> The Unprecedented Power of Organizational Credentials (OCs) Using Second-Generation VCs <p>Some of the dreamy use cases for OCs [listed in <a href="https://rufftimo.medium.com/the-dawn-of-decentralized-organizational-identity-part-2-organizational-credentials-d8baf5fd9114">Part 2</a>] are already possible, you say…&nbsp;but:</p>  Unlike most current identity technologies, including numerous high-profile implementations of first-gen VCs, OCs require no surveillance-enabling, privacy-killing ‘phone home’ to an intermediary for verification, do not rely on DNS/web security, and do not use shared ledgers/blockchains; OCs sacrifice neither security nor&nbsp;privacy.  OCs can convey the full provenance and details of authority — unlimited levels — in-band with strong verification, proving not only the authority of the representative, but the full chain of authority and where it originated.  OCs are B2C, helping prevent phishing by proving to customers and constituents that the company or government representative they’re interacting with really represents whom they claim to represent.  OCs are C2B, enabling customers and constituents to prove their identity, status, and entitlements to the businesses and governments they’re aligned with when they call in, log in, or walk&nbsp;in.  OCs can prove provenance not only back to the top of an organization, but to GLEIF (described in <a href="https://rufftimo.medium.com/the-dawn-of-decentralized-organizational-identity-part-1-identifiers-ffb9091fd47a">Part 1</a>) and/or to any other chained root of trust such as a city, state, nation, or group of&nbsp;nations.  OCs can also make verifiable any other analog identifiers in addition to or instead of the LEI. For example, a national ID, regional ID, local ID, employee ID, and any other identifiers could become cryptographically verifiable with OCs (provided their inclusion is governed by rules and safeguards similar to GLEIF’s <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/vlei/introducing-the-vlei-ecosystem-governance-framework">Ecosystem Governance Framework</a>, see <a href="https://rufftimo.medium.com/the-dawn-of-decentralized-organizational-identity-part-2-organizational-credentials-d8baf5fd9114">Part 2</a> for&nbsp;more).  <p>When an authorized representative of an organization delegates some authority to a person or a thing, whether an employee, director, contractor, partner, customer, constituent, device or piece of software — no matter how many levels deep in the organization — OCs enable that person or thing to prove it digitally, instantly, securely, and globally. OCs are a game-changer.</p> Proof of Delegated Authority <p>It’s one thing to have authority, quite another to prove it. OCs enable global verification of a representative’s delegated authority — through unlimited levels of delegation — using a powerful capability of second-generation VCs: chaining.</p><p>Chaining enables multiple levels of signatures for the same credential, and also for authority to be conveyed from signature to signature and/or credential to credential, enabling the very last link in the chain of delegated authority to be as strongly provable as the&nbsp;first.</p><p>A janitor can prove his authority with a cryptographic chain of delegated authority in the OC he carries. When verified by someone (or something) he’s presented his OC to, the chain might look like&nbsp;this:</p>  the janitor got his authority to do X and Y&nbsp;from  the facilities manager, whose authority came&nbsp;from  the regional manager, whose authority came&nbsp;from  the vice president, whose authority came&nbsp;from  the president/COO, whose authority came&nbsp;from  the CEO, who was issued a vLEI credential* by  the Qualified vLEI Issuer (QVI)* that vetted the organization, who was qualified by  the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF), a global root of trust for legal entity identification.  <p>* Described in Part&nbsp;2.</p><p>The authority for the janitor begins with the CEO of the organization, originating from a special root-level OC that he/she holds, and not with GLEIF or its QVI. A CEO credential received from a QVI is not a delegation of authority; it is a digitally signed, non-repudiable attestation that the holder of that credential really is the CEO, issued by an accredited QVI or other reputable issuer after a rigorous vetting process. What the CEO does with the credential from thereon has nothing to do with the fact that an external entity asserts that he/she really is the CEO, and has digitally signed that assertion so that it’s verifiable anywhere.</p> OCs, Privacy, and Self-Sovereignty  Personal Privacy and Graduated Disclosure <p>With OCs the personal privacy of the holder — a representative of the organization — is of less relevance when that representative is an employee or contractor and they are acting within that context; the organization gets to decide what that representative should be disclosing or keeping private, which they can do quite powerfully with Graduated Disclosure as described below. When an OC holder is a customer or constituent, however, personal privacy becomes critically and legally important, magnifying the need for robust selective disclosure capabilities.</p><p>As with all ACDC VCs, OCs have three granular, legally enforceable “Graduated Disclosure” capabilities highly relevant to and needed by organizations:</p><p>Selective disclosure — the ability to provably disclose only some information without disclosing the rest, such as one’s authority but not their name, or their name but not their authority, or only one aspect of their authority such as their financial ceiling for signing purchase orders. This capability does not use Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) by default, but can take advantage of ZKPs when&nbsp;desired.</p><p>Contractually protected disclosure — when counterparties verifiably consent to the terms of disclosure prior to disclosure. The provided consent is non-repudiable, providing a path for recourse if the terms of disclosure are not&nbsp;honored.</p><p>Contingent disclosure — disclosure is possible only when certain conditions are met, such as keeping an identity encrypted and in a form of escrow for business purposes and interactions, but enabling that identity to be discoverable by law enforcement or regulators if it becomes necessary. Contingent disclosure solves tricky problems in telecommunications, for example, when the originator of a communication may not wish to be identifiable to network operators, but must become identifiable to authorities if their traffic turns out to be fraudulent or&nbsp;spam.</p> Self-Sovereignty <p>When employees or contractors are acting in representation of an organization, the org is sovereign and not the individual; there is no self-sovereignty in this situation. There is autonomy, as the person can choose to behave however they please regardless of rules or expectations, but not self-sovereignty. Like privacy, however, the principle changes when the representative is a customer or constituent; then the sovereignty of the OC’s holder becomes relevant. Still, the customer’s or constituent’s OC was issued by the organization and can be revoked at the organization’s discretion.</p> About Blockchain… <p>Blockchain, from a data standpoint, results from implementing a centralizing protocol, as it inescapably results in a single, master set of data that all counterparties must agree to (unlike TCP/IP, HTTP, etc.). While a blockchain’s data is physically replicated across many physical locations, the only semi-decentralized aspect of blockchain is its governance, but only when that governance is permissionless, and even then it is questionable². Every aspect of permissioned blockchains is centralized, putting all data into a single logical ledger and governance into the hands of a chosen few. The point here is, blockchains in all their flavors are platforms, not protocols, and always result in data centralization, the opposite of what’s needed for globally verifiable OCs.</p><p>(Learn more about the centralizing aspects of platforms and decentralizing aspects of protocols in the seminal essay “<a href="https://knightcolumbia.org/content/protocols-not-platforms-a-technological-approach-to-free-speech">Protocols, Not Platforms</a>”, by Mike Masnick.)</p> In Conclusion <p>For those who’ve been involved with Verifiable Credentials since their official beginning in 2017, and even before that as Timothy has, the idea that a particular new flavor of VCs calls itself “second generation” would seem presumptuous, as there are several competing data models, each with their own adherents and arguments, each feeling that their favored flavor is superior to the others for one reason or&nbsp;another.</p><p>In this piece we’ve made detailed arguments as to why ACDCs are at a new, generational level compared to all other existing VC data models, and we invite reasoned arguments to the contrary.</p><p>¹ See Harvard Business Review’s <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/12/what-is-disruptive-innovation">What is Disruptive Innovation?</a></p><p>² See <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/crypto-isnt-decentralized-nft-bored-ape-yacht-club-buys-cryptopunks-2022-3">Crypto isn’t decentralized</a>, <a href="https://engineeringideas.substack.com/p/blockchain-is-not-decentralised">Blockchain is not decentralized</a>, and <a href="https://qz.com/2112965/web3-is-not-decentralized">Web3 is not decentralized</a></p>

This blog post shares some insights on how we secure DevRev APIs (north/south traffic) at the edge, and the service-to-service interactions (east/west traffic).</p><p>The DevRev platform is designed to scale up to 1 million dev organizations, and 1 billion rev users. At the time of this writing the DevRev APIs cater closer to 1 million API requests on daily basis even at the very early stage of the product. In terms of API performance, we emphasize that all the APIs should operate with a very low latency. With this in mind, we wanted our security design to bring in only the valid, legitimate traffic into the DevRev platform. Anything that does not look right, we reject at the&nbsp;edge.</p><p>At the edge, we use Fastly Next-Gen WAF (powered by Signal Sciences) to monitor for suspicious and anomalous API traffic and protect in real-time, against attacks directed at our public APIs and the origin servers. Once the requests pass through the WAF, we use Fastly Compute@Edge to validate each&nbsp;request.</p><p>Fastly provides us with the capability to execute our code at the edge through a WebAssembly module. We’ve developed an edge gateway in Rust, which compiles into a WebAssembly module. This Rust code is responsible for rejecting any API requests lacking a valid JWT. JWT verification is just one of the tasks we perform at the edge. The edge gateway responsibilities also encompass cache management, reporting API statistics to Google BigQuery, sending logs to Datadog, enforcing captcha, URL rewriting, CORS management, API allow-listing based on various parameters, and proxying traffic to secure S3 endpoints, among others. Furthermore, we are in the process of introducing coarse-grained authorization at the edge. This additional measure will assist in filtering only legitimate traffic to DevRev services. The entire Rust code executing at the edge takes no longer than 5 ms to complete its&nbsp;tasks.</p><p>Fastly Compute@Edge serves as the entry point at the edge for DevRev services. At the origin, an API gateway intercepts all incoming traffic. The responsibilities of this API gateway go far beyond the functionalities typically found in open source or commercial API gateways. In fact, it functions as both an API gateway and an integrator, developed in-house at DevRev. Throughout the remainder of this blog, we will refer to it as the DevRev&nbsp;gateway.</p><p>As a second level of defense, we perform JWT verification at the origin using the DevRev gateway, even though it is redundant. Ideally, we should not receive any 401 errors from the origin, and we actively monitor this using Datadog alerts. The verification of a JWT takes less than 2ms at the origin. Additionally, we have implemented a token-based authentication mechanism between the Fastly edge and the DevRev gateway. This, coupled with IP allowlisting, ensures that no request can bypass the Fastly edge to reach the DevRev&nbsp;gateway.</p><p>The JWT carries the identity of the API user. An API user can be one of the following types:</p>  An Auth0 user. We utilize Auth0 as the trusted Identity Provider for the DevRev platform. Auth0 authenticates users through methods such as OTP over email, social connections, and enterprise connections. To access the DevRev web app or mobile app, users must first authenticate via Auth0. Auth0 assigns a distinctive identification to each user known as the Auth0 user ID. This ID is formed by combining the connection name with the immutable identifier specific to the user within the associated connection.  A Dev user: A Dev user is a member of a Dev organization within the DevRev platform. All Dev users are Auth0 users; however, the reverse is not necessarily true. The DevRev web app and mobile app invoke APIs on behalf of Dev users, or the Dev users themselves can directly invoke DevRev&nbsp;APIs.  A Rev user: A Rev user is a customer of a Dev organization and has the authorization to access specific DevRev APIs. In most cases, the DevRev main app doesn’t actively authenticate Rev users; instead, it relies on the corresponding Dev organization for authentication. Based on a trust relationship with the Dev organization, Rev users are granted access to DevRev APIs. However, the DevRev support portal permits Rev users to log in directly. In an upcoming blog post, we will delve into the details of building this trust relationship and explain how we authenticate Rev users at both the edge and the&nbsp;origin.  A service account: A service account represents an application that communicates with the DevRev APIs. For instance, when you integrate the DevRev PLuG widget into your web app or use the PLuG mobile SDK in your mobile app, the PLuG functions as a service account. A service account can access DevRev APIs independently or on behalf of a Dev user or a Rev&nbsp;user.  <p>The DevRev gateway at the origin serves as the entry point to the DevRev microservices backend. Once it verifies the JWT accompanying the API request, the gateway dispatches the request to the appropriate service. All services are developed in Golang and communicate with each other using&nbsp;gRPC.</p><p>The gateway and all other services are deployed within a Kubernetes cluster. Each service operates within its own namespace and is deployed behind an envoy proxy. When a service spins up, it is provisioned with a key by Istio, which also manages key rotation. These keys are subsequently utilized by each service for mTLS authentication between services. The same applies to the&nbsp;gateway.</p><p>mTLS is good enough to identify a service, but it has its own challenges as well. We’ve built a service-to-service authentication mechanism that combines mTLS with JWT due to the following reasons.</p>  Flexibility and decoupling: JWT can be used in scenarios where you need more flexibility and decoupling between services. It allows you to issue tokens that can carry various claims and information about the user or entity. This can be useful in scenarios where you want to provide fine-grained access control or share specific user attributes between services.  Statelessness: JWT is a stateless authentication mechanism, meaning the server doesn’t need to store token-related information. This can be advantageous when scalability and performance are crucial, as the server doesn’t need to maintain session-related data.  Cross-Domain Communication: JWT can be used for cross-domain communication between different services. Since JWTs are self-contained and can carry service-related information, they can facilitate communication between services without requiring direct interaction or shared session&nbsp;state.  <p>When a service spins up within the DevRev platform, it talks to the STS (Security Token Service) deployed in the same Kubernetes cluster. Through mTLS authentication, the service requests a JWT. This particular JWT is referred to as the Application Access Token (AAT). The AAT’s subject is a system-generated identifier linked to the Kubernetes service name of the corresponding service making the AAT request. In simpler terms, an AAT is accompanied by a corresponding service account, and the AAT’s subject is the identifier of that service account, which we call a service account&nbsp;DON.</p><p>The URI field within the X509 certificate corresponding to each service (or workload), issued by Istio contains the SPIFFE ID linked to that specific service. When the STS issues a JWT for a service that authenticates with the STS through mTLS, it appends the same SPIFFE ID found in the incoming X509 certificate as a claim to the JWT it creates and subsequently shares with the service. This process effectively binds the JWT to the corresponding service identity connected to the mTLS connection.</p><p>Each microservice is linked to a predefined service account, and a particular service has the ability to establish its own access control policies for these service accounts. For instance, the Janus service might permit read operations from the gateway service account, while the codex service could enable the gateway service account to impersonate a specific group of Rev&nbsp;users.</p><p>At the end of the day, every service is provisioned with a JWT, which it utilizes to access upstream microservices. These JWTs are of short duration, and as they approach expiration, the corresponding service is required to communicate with the STS once more to obtain a fresh&nbsp;JWT.</p><p>One fundamental best practice when generating a JWT is to define a restrictive audience. For instance, referring back to the service-to-service authentication using JWT discussed in the preceding section, the token generated by the STS for the gateway’s communication with the Janus service should specifically carry ‘janus’ as the audience value. Consequently, the Janus service cannot utilize the same JWT received from the gateway to communicate with the STS. This is because the token’s audience is ‘janus’, while the STS anticipates a token with an audience value of&nbsp;‘sts’.</p><p>One drawback of this model is that it would lead to more frequent interactions between the STS and other services, resulting in increased communication overhead. Furthermore, each service would be required to manage distinct tokens for every upstream service it engages with. While we opted not to adopt this model with different audience values, we were still unwilling to take the risk of one service employing a token from another service to access an upstream service, essentially impersonating the original&nbsp;service.</p><p>Binding the JWT to the SPIFFE ID associated with the X509 certificate of a particular service proves beneficial in this context. Every upstream service not only verifies the JWT received from the downstream service but also confirms whether it is tied to the SPIFFE ID related to the underlying mTLS connection. This mechanism ensures that the Janus service cannot utilize the JWT acquired from the gateway to gain access to the STS as if it were the&nbsp;gateway.</p><p>Alongside the service context, the interactions between services also include the user context. The gateway forwards the JWT it receives from the client to the upstream services when necessary. This JWT carries the user context. In the current model, these client JWTs might originate from two different issuers: Auth0 and the STS. However, as we move forward, our goal is for all services to exclusively trust STS-issued tokens. This implies that clients will need to exchange the token they receive from Auth0 for an STS-issued token before gaining access to DevRev&nbsp;APIs.</p><p>Why would the client need to exchange the Auth0 token for an STS token, and why shouldn’t the gateway handle this conversion in the background, passing the STS-issued token to the upstream services? However, this approach would result in more frequent interactions between the gateway and the STS, requiring token exchange for each request. Such an approach introduces unnecessary overhead.</p><p>A given service possessing the JWT containing the user context will not have unrestricted access to any arbitrary service using that JWT. We enforce stringent access control policies at each service, ensuring that incoming requests are processed only after evaluating not only the user context but also the corresponding service&nbsp;context.</p><p>A token that has been previously issued to a client or user, whether by Auth0 or the STS, can be revoked for two reasons. The associated user or the organization to which the user belongs may no longer be part of the DevRev platform, or the user themselves or an admin of the organization could explicitly revoke a specific&nbsp;token.</p><p>To address the former, the DevRev gateway verifies the active status of a user or organization within the platform after each token validation. In order to reduce unnecessary service calls and database queries, the gateway maintains a cache of recognized users.</p><p>To explicitly revoke a token, the client can make use of the revoke API provided by the STS. After a token is revoked, the STS includes the metadata related to the revoked token in a cache accessible to the gateway for reading. The gateway then rejects any tokens corresponding to the token metadata found within the revoked token cache. We are currently working on making this list of revoked tokens available to the Fastly edge gateway, which will then reject any requests carrying a revoked token at the edge&nbsp;itself.</p><p>In this blog post, we provided a high-level overview of how we secure both north/south and east/west traffic at DevRev. In future blog posts, we will delve deeper into the key aspects of the DevRev microservices security&nbsp;design.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com/securing-north-south-and-east-west-traffic-devrev-2004b4397950">Securing north/south and east/west traffic @ DevRev</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com">FACILELOGIN</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Past practices included techniques like virtual private networks (VPNs) that tried to emulate the idea of an intranet where trusted computers and people were protected from hackers by a firewall that "kept the bad stuff out." As more and more work has gone remote and personal devices like phones, tablets, and even laptops are being used for work, a firewall—virtual or physical—offers less and less protection. Often the bad actors are hard to tell apart from your employees, partners, and customers.</p><p>Zero Trust operates on a simple yet powerful principle: "assume breach." In a world where network boundaries are increasingly porous and cyber threats are more evasive than ever, the Zero Trust model centers around the notion that no one, whether internal or external, should be inherently trusted. This approach mandates continuous verification, strict access controls, and micro-segmentation, ensuring that every user and device proves their legitimacy before gaining access to sensitive resources. If we assume breach, then the only strategy that can protect the corporate network, infrastructure, applications, and people is to authorize every access.</p> Defense in Depth <p>Zero Trust solutions offer a multifaceted defense against the evolving threat landscape, encompassing various aspects of network security, infrastructure protection, user authentication, and application security. These solutions collectively work together to uphold the "never trust, always verify" principle. Here are some of the different kinds of Zero Trust solutions that safeguard networks, infrastructure, people, and applications from malicious actors:</p>  <p>Network Security:</p>  <p>Micro-Segmentation: Dividing the network into smaller segments to limit lateral movement of threats and control access between different segments.</p>  <p>Software-Defined Perimeter (SDP): Creating an invisible perimeter around resources, allowing authorized users and devices to connect while remaining invisible to unauthorized entities.</p>    <p>Infrastructure Protection:</p>  <p>Identity and Access Management (IAM): Implementing strong identity verification and access controls to ensure that only authenticated users can access critical resources.</p>  <p>Endpoint Security: Employing solutions that monitor and secure devices (endpoints) to prevent malware infiltration and unauthorized access.</p>    <p>User Authentication:</p>  <p>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Requiring users to provide multiple forms of verification (e.g., password, fingerprint, OTP) before granting access.</p>  <p>Risk-Based Authentication: Assessing user behavior and context to dynamically adjust authentication requirements based on potential risks.</p>    <p>Application Security:</p>  <p>Application Whitelisting: Allowing only approved applications to run, preventing the execution of unauthorized or malicious software.</p>  <p>Application-Centric Authorization and Security: Implementing application-specific authorization policies and implementing security measures directly within applications, such as encryption, code signing, and runtime protection.</p>    <p>These Zero Trust practices collectively work to defend corporate assets in depth and implement a security architecture that assumes breach and enforces rigorous access controls. This not only reduces the attack surface, but also minimizes potential damage. By safeguarding networks, infrastructure, people, and applications, organizations can better defend against the increasingly sophisticated tactics employed by malicious actors in the digital realm. A comprehensive Zero Trust approach ensures that security is embedded at every layer, providing a robust defense against cyber threats.</p> Implementing Zero Trust <p>Some of the components of a zero trust strategy can be bought. For example, network equipment vendors offer products that make it easier to implement micro segmentation or define a perimeter. You can buy IAM solutions that make it easier to up your authentication game to simultaneously reduce phishing and the burden on your employees, partners, and customers (hint: <a href="https://www.passkeys.io/">use passkeys</a>). You can buy a endpoint security clients for devices that make it easier to manage corporate devices and to know the security posture of both corporate and personal devices. Authorization platforms like <a href="https://www.cedarpolicy.com/en">Cedar</a> are available to control access to your infrastructure and applications.</p><p><a href="https://www.technometria.com/p/zero-trust?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share">Share</a></p><p>While vendors provide ready-made solutions for many aspects of Zero Trust, you'll still need to tailor these solutions to your organization's unique needs and integrate them into a coherent strategy. Here's breakdown of the things you need to do on your own (i.e., you can't buy these):</p>  <p>Policy Development:</p>  <p>Access Policies: You'll need to design access policies that define who can access what resources and under what circumstances.</p>  <p>Authentication Policies: Developing policies for user authentication, device verification, and authorization.</p>  <p>Organizational Policies: The organization must define how it governs the various aspects of Zero Trust and the underlying identity infrastructure.</p>    <p>Identity and Access Management (IAM):</p>  <p>Identity Management Infrastructure: Building a user identity repository, user directories, and user profiles.</p>  <p>Access Control Logic: Developing the logic that enforces access controls based on user roles and permissions.</p>    <p>Custom Integrations:</p>  <p>Integration with Existing Systems: If you have legacy systems, you might need to develop custom integrations to ensure they adhere to the Zero Trust model.</p>    <p>Training and Awareness:</p>  <p>Security Awareness Programs: Creating training materials and programs to educate employees and stakeholders about Zero Trust principles and best practices.</p>    <p>Continuous Monitoring and Analysis:</p>  <p>Threat Detection Logic: Developing mechanisms to continuously monitor network traffic, endpoints, and applications for suspicious activities.</p>    <p>The Zero Trust components in the preceding list require internal expertise and a deep understanding of your organization's structure and workflows. You might need to change how your organization does authentication, develop a process for installing and maintaining device clients, perform numerous integrations, create authorization policies as well as organizational policies, build threat dashboards, and institute a training program. You can get help doing this, but ultimately it's up to you.</p><p>Zero Trust represents a big change for many organizations. Implementing a Zero Trust strategy involves not just changing the architecture of your network, infrastructure, and applications, but your organizational culture as well. In a hyper-connected digital landscape marked by relentless cyber threats and evolving attack vectors, the Zero Trust model is the best defense available. By challenging the conventional "trust but verify" approach, Zero Trust asks organizations to embrace an "assume breach" mindset, demanding continuous vigilance to authorize every access.</p>   <p>Photo Credit: <a href="https://pixabay.com/photos/shut-gate-open-message-security-2644555/">Open Gate</a> from aitoff (Pixabay License)</p>

 World ID&nbsp;Critique  OpenID Connect Implementation Antipatterns <p>On July 24th, Worldcoin <a href="https://worldcoin.org/blog/announcements/worldcoin-project-launches">publicly launched</a> World ID, and many friends and colleagues pinged me to get my opinion. I was attending <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/117/agenda">IETF 117</a> and this past weekend I finally had time to start exploring the service now that it has launched. There has been TONS of coverage on the orb, the biometrics, and the coin. I’m going to review their OpenID Connect implementation.</p><blockquote>This evaluation was made on August 7, 2023 using a production deployment of the Hellō app on Worldcoin; Worldcoin’s <a href="https://docs.worldcoin.org/reference/sign-in">Sign in with Worldcoin Reference</a>; and their <a href="https://docs.worldcoin.org/further-reading/oidc">OIDC Explainer</a>.</blockquote><blockquote>Update August 9: On August 8, I provided a draft of this document to Worldcoin prior to publication. They have addressed a number of issues as noted&nbsp;below.</blockquote> Tl;dr:   If you are a developer considering adding World ID to your project.&nbsp;Wait.  If you see an app using World ID. Be&nbsp;safe.  The <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-security-topics">OAuth Best Security Current Practices</a> have not been followed. Combined with the following point, applications using World ID may be vulnerable to&nbsp;attacks.  The implementation is not compliant with the <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html">OpenID Connect</a> specification. Times are in milliseconds instead of seconds, requests can be made without required parameters. Update Aug 9, these have been addressed.  The user’s privacy is being violated. The authorization page presents no information on what the application is requesting, nor on what worldcoin.org is releasing. There are no application terms of service and privacy policy&nbsp;links.   OpenID Connect Background <p>OpenID Connect (OIDC) is a popular identity protocol used by social login services such as Apple, Google, Facebook, and Microsoft. There are libraries in all popular programming languages, and plug-ins for all popular platforms.</p><p>The typical user experience with OpenID Connect starts with clicking on a button in the app, and then redirecting you to your provider — Apple, Google etc. If you don’t have an active session, you are prompted to login to your provider. If you have not used the app where you started, you will be shown what will be shared, and prompted if you want to continue. If you continue, you will be redirected back to the app sharing your information. There are a few variants on what is sent back and forth between the app and your provider, but the end result is usually an ID Token that is digitally signed by the provider. The contents of the token indicate who issued it, which user it is for, when it was issued, when it expires, which app requested it, and handshake data to ensure the token is for the user that started the&nbsp;flow.</p><p>OpenID Connect is built on top of <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749">OAuth 2.0</a>, the most popular authorization protocol on the internet. (I happen to have led the initial design, and am listed as the editor.) These protocols have been around for over a decade and have had significant security analysis and improvements including in the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/oauth/about/">IETF OAuth meetings</a>, the <a href="https://openid.net/">OpenID Foundation</a>, and <a href="https://oauth.net/workshop/">OAuth Security Workshop</a>. There are 28 published <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/oauth/documents/">IETF RFCs</a> and <a href="https://openid.net/developers/specs/">12 OpenID Connect specifications</a>.</p><p>Worldcoin launched with support for OpenID Connect, significantly lowering the barrier for developer adoption, and building on the decade of security and deployment experience. (My startup, <a href="https://hello.coop/">Hellō</a> chose to support OpenID Connect for the same reasons.)</p><p>There are two significant documents that have been under development for a couple of years: the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-security-topics/">OAuth 2.0 Best Security Practices</a>; and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1/">OAuth 2.1</a>. The latter does not introduce any new features, but compiles a dozen documents into a single coherent document that removes conflicting information.</p><p>Unfortunately it does not look like Worldcoin consulted them.</p> Adding World ID to&nbsp;Hellō <p>I have integrated all the popular OpenID Connect providers into <a href="https://hello.coop/">Hellō</a> (Apple, Facebook, GitLab, Google, Line, Microsoft, Twitch, Yahoo) and OAuth 2.0 providers (Discord, GitHub, Instagram, Mastodon, Reddit, Tumblr, Twitter, and WordPress). We also support Metamask, WalletConnect, and passkeys. Our code deals with how each of the providers is their own “special snowflake”, so I thought adding World ID would be straightforward, and we would have access to the unique “human” claim Worldcoin promised.</p> Signing up for World&nbsp;ID <p>To access the Developer Portal, you need a World ID which requires you to install the World App. I installed it on my iPhone, verified my phone number, and was then prompted to create a password. The app then crashed. Oops! After restarting, the app displayed “Creating World ID” and a counter that indicated it was going to take some time. I set my phone aside and when I checked it later it had crashed again. I restarted the app, was shown the passport-like display, and then once again displayed “Creating World ID”. As you can see from the screen grabs, some time passed between the initial install screen and the other screen shots included below. Eventually the World App was happy and I had a World&nbsp;ID.</p><blockquote>A password? It’s 2023. Why not support passkeys? All modern iOS and Android devices support it. I understand the desire to support older and less expensive devices, but it makes no sense to not support stronger, phishing resistant authentication when available. Passwords just increase the attack&nbsp;surface.</blockquote><blockquote>Face ID Opt in? The World App by default is able to log into a site without further authentication. There is no PIN or Face ID when you open the World App, or use it to log into another app. IE, if your phone is unlocked, someone can use it to login to a website just by scanning the QR code. If you poke around in the settings, you can enable Face ID, but I was not prompted to turn it&nbsp;on.</blockquote> World ID Developer Portal <p>To access the developer portal, you must log in with your World ID. The website shows a QR code that you scan with the World App on your phone. The process is smooth, and you see a logo verified mark beside Worldcoin Developer Portal giving me confidence I’m logging into the correct app with my World&nbsp;ID.</p> Developer Experience <p>If you are not a developer, you may be tempted to skip this section. Don’t. There is not much to it, and that is where the issues&nbsp;start.</p><p>After logging into the developer portal, I was prompted to enter and then verify my email address. Creating an app was straightforward. (Almost as straightforward as at the <a href="https://console.hello.coop">Hellō Console</a>&nbsp;;)</p><p>The initial delight of the simple experience disappeared when I realized key configuration was missing. There was no mechanism to upload a logo. No terms of service or privacy policy urls. No verification process so my app would show up verified like the Worldcoin Developer Portal.</p> register API <p>The Sign In Reference documents a <a href="https://docs.worldcoin.org/reference/sign-in#register-app:~:text=Copied!-,Register%20App,a%20new%20application%20for%20use%20with%20Sign%20In%20with%20World%20ID.,-Required%20attributes">Register App API</a>, an alternative to registering through the&nbsp;portal.</p><p>The one required parameter is “redirect_uris”, which is mislabelled as a string, despite the example showing it as an array of strings. The description:</p><blockquote>URLs the user will be redirected to after authentication. Must be HTTPS, and can always be updated in the Developer Portal.</blockquote><p>… is strange, as there is no authentication with the API, so how would Worldcoin know which application I can&nbsp;update?</p><p>The example curl code that you can copy to run yourself:</p> curl -X POST https://id.worldcoin.org/register \<br>    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \<br>    -d '{<br>        "client_name": "Example Application",<br>        "logo_uri": "https://app.example.com/logo.svg",<br>        "redirect_uris": ["https://app.example.com/callback", "https://app.example.com/redirect"],<br>        "application_type": "web",<br>        "grant_types": "authorization_code",<br>        "response_types": "code"<br>    }' <p>… shows an SVG file being provided as the logo. Wow. No providers allow SVG files due to the XSS security risks of an attacker embedding malicious JS in the image, which would then be loaded on id.worldcoin.org if the SVG was not run through a sophisticated filter.</p><blockquote>Worldcoin responded to this concern on Aug&nbsp;9:</blockquote><blockquote>Worldcoin developer portal is not vulnerable for the following reasons:</blockquote><blockquote>- The Worldcoin developer portal has a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) that prevents external images like a malicious SVG from loading entirely.</blockquote><blockquote>- The Worldcoin developer portal uses &lt;img&gt; tags to embed logo_url content, which prevents embedded scripts inside SVGs from executing.</blockquote><blockquote>- Additionally, apps must currently be manually verified to display logos, which has the added benefit of preventing impersonation scams.</blockquote><blockquote>UPDATE Aug 12: the example shows using a&nbsp;.png instead of a&nbsp;.svg file. The API provides the same error&nbsp;though.</blockquote><p>Unfortunately I was not able to test this (or fortunately given all the security risks of an anonymous registration API?) the API was not working. I tried a number of parameter permutations, but the server would always would return an HTTP 500 response code&nbsp;and:</p> {<br>  "code": "server_error",<br>  "message": "Internal server error. Please try again."<br>}  World ID Login Experience <p>With a configured app, I could now check out the World ID user experience on my own app. (See below for how I did this without writing&nbsp;code.)</p><p>Starting the flow in a browser looks similar to the login flow for the developer portal. Looking more carefully, it looks exactly the same. There is no indication that I am logging into my app vs the Worldcoin Developer Portal.</p><p>In the World App, the flow looks similar with the exception that Hellō is not a verified app. The only signals of which app is being logged into are the letter “H” as the logo, and “Hellō” as the app name. Note there is no terms or service or privacy policy links for Hellō anywhere, and no indication of what is being shared with&nbsp;Hellō.</p> Platform Detection <p>While resizing my browser window to access the developer tools, I noticed the web interface naively just looks at the window width to decide if it is on a mobile device. Pity the poor user trying to use their World ID on a web app where the browser window is&nbsp;narrow.</p> Developer Portal Session&nbsp;Length <p>I went back to the developer portal a day later, and my session was still active. I would have expected it to time out after an hour of inactivity at most. Sure, I should have logged out, but an attacker could take over a sloppy developer’s app.</p> Protocol Exploration <p>Ok, we are going to start to get a little more technical. If you have a some idea of how the web works, you should be able to follow&nbsp;along.</p><p>Given the nature of OpenID Connect, you don’t need to write any code to explore what a provider will do. You can open up a URL with the right parameters to make an authorization request, and then use the browser’s developer tools to see what was sent back. This is all I did in my exploration.</p><p>I started off with a simple and incomplete request to see what errors I got. (new lines are for readability)</p> https://id.worldcoin.org/authorize<br>  ?client_id=app_404ea2eb1e2d5155c05c3b2878ca1ade<br>  &amp;response_type=id_token<br>  &amp;redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwallet.hello.coop%2Foauth%2Fresponse%2Fworldcoin <p>To my surprise, this worked. I got back the following JSON in the ID&nbsp;Token.</p> {<br>  "header": {<br>    "alg":"RS256",  <br>    "typ":"JWT",<br>    "kid":"jwk_dad75cf7c4bc159276c2c748a196b11d"<br>  }, <br>  "payload": {<br>    "iss":"https://id.worldcoin.org",<br>    "sub":"0x233c7136721dd85256e936a6a0b5a67b0f904bed6d1ce91d6d7364e9064f9cc2",<br>    "jti":"7fcd4fb6-63c4-4019-9ed2-43b14af657e0",<br>    "iat":1691444766901,<br>    "exp":1691448366901,<br>    "aud":"app_404ea2eb1e2d5155c05c3b2878ca1ade",<br>    "scope":"",<br>    "https://id.worldcoin.org/beta": {<br>      "likely_human":"weak",<br>      "credential_type":"phone"<br>    },<br>    "nonce":"1691444748611"<br>  }<br>} <p>Why was I surprised? I should have gotten an error response.</p><p>The “scope” parameter is required per OpenID Connect, and must contain the “openid” scope to differentiate between an OpenID Connect request and an OAuth 2.0&nbsp;request.</p><blockquote>UPDATE: Aug 9<br>An error is now returned if the “openid” scope is not&nbsp;provided</blockquote><p>Either a “nonce” or a <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636">PKCE</a> “code_challenge” should be required per security best practices to prevent replay attacks per OAuth Security Best Practices. As this is an implicit flow, it would have to be a&nbsp;“nonce”.</p><blockquote>UPDATE: Aug 9<br>An error is now returned if a “nonce” is not provided<br>UPDATE: Aug 12<br>I only checked the “id_token” request type. Reading the docs I noticed they state the nonce is only required for the “id_token” request type, not the “code” request type. That is not spec compliant. It is required for the code request type as well since it is required to be in the “id_token” you get back when exchanging the code at the token endpoint.</blockquote><blockquote>UPDATE: Aug 12<br>I had only been testing the “id_token” response type. The “code” response type does NOT return a “nonce” in the ID token even if one is provided in the authorization request. IE, there is no way to check that the “id_token” you received is associated with the session that started the flow. While an attacker can inject a “code” and have you receive back a different ID Token. This is not a huge risk though since if you are validating the ID Token, it will fail since there is no&nbsp;“nonce”!</blockquote><p>Looking at the ID Token, I was even more surprised. The “iat” (issued at) and “exp” (expiry) claims are in milliseconds instead of seconds. Most validation libraries will consider the ID Token to be valid as it was issued in the far future. This online parser thinks the token was issued at November 10, 55569, over 53,000 years from&nbsp;now.</p><blockquote>UPDATE: Aug 9<br>This has been fixed. “iat” and “exp” are now in&nbsp;seconds</blockquote><p>Despite not providing a “nonce” in the request, I got back one with the value of “1691444748611”, a millisecond time stamp that is 18290 ms prior to when the ID Token was issued (1691444766901). A nonce should be a random value, so clearly there is some logic failure here as there should not be a “nonce” in the token as one was not provided.</p><p>My last surprise in the ID Token was the “https://id.worldcoin.org/beta" claim:</p> "https://id.worldcoin.org/beta": {<br>    "likely_human":"weak",<br>    "credential_type":"phone"<br> } <p>As a user, I had not been informed that this data was going to be shared. As a developer, I had not asked for it. I consider this a privacy&nbsp;issue.</p><p>Next I tried sending a valid request. The valid scopes are not documented, but poking around at the examples I saw that “openid”, “email”, and “profile” were being used. Here is what I sent next, that includes a “nonce” and “scope” parameters:</p> https://id.worldcoin.org/authorize<br>  ?client_id=app_404ea2eb1e2d5155c05c3b2878ca1ade<br>  &amp;response_type=id_token<br>  &amp;redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwallet.hello.coop%2Foauth%2Fresponse%2Fworldcoin<br>  &amp;nonce=nonce1<br>  &amp;scope=openid+email+profile <p>And I received the following JSON back in the ID&nbsp;Token:</p> {<br>   "header": {<br>      "alg":"RS256",<br>      "typ":"JWT",<br>      "kid":"jwk_dad75cf7c4bc159276c2c748a196b11d"<br>  }, <br>  "payload": {<br>      "iss":"https://id.worldcoin.org",<br>      "sub":"0x233c7136721dd85256e936a6a0b5a67b0f904bed6d1ce91d6d7364e9064f9cc2",<br>      "jti":"bc24c584-e061-4c62-aaa1-c85cbb38579e",<br>      "iat":1691443980673,<br>      "exp":1691447580673,<br>      "aud":"app_404ea2eb1e2d5155c05c3b2878ca1ade",<br>      "scope":"openid email profile",<br>      "https://id.worldcoin.org/beta":{<br>        "likely_human":"weak",<br>        "credential_type":"phone"<br>      },<br>      "nonce":"nonce1",<br>      "email":"0x233c7136721dd85256e936a6a0b5a67b0f904bed6d1ce91d6d7364e9064f9cc2@id.worldcoin.org",<br>      "name":"World ID User",<br>      "given_name":"World ID",<br>      "family_name":"User"<br>  }<br>} <p>We got back the “nonce” value we sent. The “email”, “name”, “given_name”, “family_name” claims are not useful. Based on the documentation, it looks like they included them because some library complained.</p> Directed Identifiers <p>Next up was checking what was different in ID Tokens between different applications. I was hoping to confirm a different identifier, specifically the “sub”, would be different for me across applications per the <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2022/05/10/laws-of-identity/#:~:text=4.%20Directed%20Identity">4th Law of Identity</a>.</p><p>My app was&nbsp;given:</p> "sub":"0x233c7136721dd85256e936a6a0b5a67b0f904bed6d1ce91d6d7364e9064f9cc2" <p>… and the developer portal was given a different identifier, which is what we&nbsp;want:</p> "sub":"0x29a6e7c076c0922e146e96c92b5d4c8833818cc89166f483903a731d2e757253" <p>… and the second production app I setup was given yet another identifier:</p> "sub":"0x2d20b5094a2e2f8be4542f40e7eca9b701b4763877cc4fede42dfa6ea756a31c" <p>The latter is going to be a problem for developers as they want to know it is the same user across apps. Many large providers that only allowed one app per developer have kludged together mechanisms for developers to get this common identifier. Wanting the same user identifiers across each of developer’s app will motivate them to use the same “client_id” and “client_secret” across apps, dissolving the separation of concerns.</p> Access Token <p>The next thing I explored was setting “response_type” to “token” instead of an “id_token”. This provides an access token that can be used to call the user_info endpoint, and potentially any other API exposed by the provider.</p><p>First of all, this should not have worked in an implicit flow where the “token” is returned as a redirect parameter. It is now in the browser history and available to any malicious code with access. (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-security-topics#name-access-token-in-browser-his">Security BCP&nbsp;4.3.2</a>)</p><p>The bigger issue is that the access token is an ID Token. There was no difference in the token format in conflict with <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8725.html">RFC 8752</a> section 3.11 and 3.12, conflating authorization with authentication.</p> response_mode <p>The default mechanism to return the results from an authorization request is to include them as query parameters. This has the downside of sensitive parameters such as tokens being captured in server logs that save the URL being requested, and potentially exposes the parameters to unencrypted wireless networks.</p><p>The “fragment” response mode returns the results in the URL fragment, which is not sent to the server by the browser. This allows a web app to access the results. The “form_post” mode passes the parameters to the server as a form post rather than as query parameters, keeping the parameters out of the server logs of the page&nbsp;request.</p><p>I tried getting results by passing the “response_mode” parameter set to both “fragment” and “form_post”. Unfortunately, Worldcoin ignores the “response_mode” parameter. All results are returned as query parameters.</p> Documentation Concerns <p>Developers depend on a provider’s documentation to guide them. Unfortunately, the Worldcoin documentation is lacking, leading to developer frustration, or worse, vulnerable applications.</p><p>The only explanation for how to start the OpenID Connect flow is in <a href="https://docs.worldcoin.org/further-reading/oidc">Further Reading | OIDC Explainer</a>, not where a developer would start. The Quickstart tells developers to following the Auth0 Integration.</p><blockquote>I’m surprised the Auth0 integration would work given the non-standard ID Token “iss” and “iat” claims — but perhaps it only uses a token flow? — I have not investigated.</blockquote> nonce <p>The OIDC Explainer casually mentions the “nonce”, does not say it is required (it should be), and provides no explanation what the developer should do to confirm the ID Token they have received is linked to the authorization request they started, which is one of the purposes of the&nbsp;”nonce”.</p> scope <p>No mention of the “scope” parameter, which is required. No list of valid scopes is provided. I figured out the “openid”, “email”, and “profile” scopes by looking at examples. While “openid” is required, the “profile” scope return generic information, the “email” claim is just the “sub” claim prepended to “@id.worldcoin.org”.</p><blockquote>UPDATE Aug 12: <br>The documentation has been updated to include the “scope” parameter and shows “openid%20profile%20email”, so one can more easily guess what scopes are allowed. The docs say that the default scope is “openid”, but it is now required to be spec compliant. The “nonce” parameter is now stated as required when using id_token response type, although best practice is for there to be a nonce in the id_token returned for “code” response types as well. The docs are moving in the right direction!</blockquote> Closing Thoughts <p>Given the <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/worldcoin">$125M raised</a> and the involvement of Sam Altman of Y Combinator and OpenAI fame, I had expected a robust OpenID implementation that would have lowered the bar for developers to adopt World ID and inspired innovation.</p><p>This disregard for following the standard and published best security practices is alarming. Not informing a user about what is being released about them displays a disregard for user privacy. A step backwards for the identity industry.</p>

 An open solicitation for high-volume wallet&nbsp;projects <p>If you have, work with, or are aware of a digital personal wallet project capable of onboarding and supporting hundreds of millions of individuals in a short period of time, we’d like to speak with&nbsp;you.</p><p>Digital Trust Ventures (DTV) has launched a startup, currently in stealth mode, that will generate up to hundreds of millions of wallet holders sometime around the middle of 2024. This startup will not provide personal wallet services, and instead will rely on partners to satisfy the near-instant strong demand that will be generated upon launch. We are seeking two partners to be part of this launch, who will offer competing wallets that are fully interoperable with each other and with the DTV startup’s KERI-based tooling.</p><p>A personal wallet partner&nbsp;must:</p>  Be capable of scaling to hundreds of millions of users in a short period of time (from 1 to 30&nbsp;days)  Provide appropriate self-service and other support for all&nbsp;users  Support KERI and&nbsp;ACDCs  Be thin/keys-at-the-edge, with ACDCs managed through hosted cloud&nbsp;agents  Support all ACDCs, regardless of project participation  Support simple messaging  Have an excellent, simple&nbsp;UI/UX  Be ready to go by Summer&nbsp;2024  <p>The wallet must support freemium pricing; a strong monetization model for the personal wallet along with other details of the project will be shared under NDA with qualified prospective partners.</p><p>In exchange for providing all of this, the partner will enjoy global recognition on a stage with no equal, and the chance to quickly onboard hundreds of millions of users. We are looking for strong, established companies with clear capabilities to handle a project this large, not startups.</p><p>If you are involved with or know of a project that has these capabilities, please get in touch to learn more by sending an email to <a href="mailto:wallets@digitaltrust.vc">wallets@digitaltrust.vc</a>.</p>

<p>We’ve spent decades building up systems that identify people and devices, and interconnect all of them. We’ve built systems that let us define and control accounts, assign access rights, and associate trust within and across boundaries. But today’s mobile, cloud, and distributed systems are complex beasts that defy the assumptions many of our architectures bring to the&nbsp;table.</p><p>Maybe it’s time to rethink what accounts and federation even mean. And for that, I’ve been thinking lately about&nbsp;bubbles.</p> Bubbles <p>A bubble is an interesting physical construct. A thin boundary that surrounds its contents. What’s part of the bubble is separated from what’s around the bubble by that boundary, creating a sub-entity that only exists and makes sense in a larger&nbsp;space.</p>Just some bubbles making a&nbsp;foam<p>In classical computer network systems, we liked putting hard boundaries up around things. Firewalls and even physical network cable separation let us define what was “in” and “out”. If you were on the network, you had to be good, because we made sure of that before you were allowed on the&nbsp;network.</p><p>While these approaches still have their uses, today we know that it’s not enough. Devices cross network boundaries all the time, and even our trusted API services dart around cloud data centers, pulling pieces and components and data from places we can’t fully predict and plan ahead of time. So the world has moved to a zero-trust approach, where we build security into every part of the architecture instead of assuming it’ll get stopped at the door. That is a very good thing, but it also turns out to not quite be&nbsp;enough.</p><p>Organizations want to be able to control policies in a central fashion, to define accounts and access in one dashboard. But on the other hand, cloud services need to make extremely local decisions in potentially ephemeral environments — do I start X image on Y network to process Z request? This dichotomy creates a tension in the system that only increases when you start to cross network and trust domain boundaries.</p><p>We need to address this, and that’s why I’ve been thinking about bubbles. Bubbles provide context, boundaries, and differentiation, and that’s what I think we need to consider in our identity and security&nbsp;systems.</p><p>Within a bubble, there’s a certain degree of trust, like the set of services within a pod on a shared virtual network. I can make hyper-local decisions about access and security, and I can do it in a way that doesn’t require me to talk outside the bubble. I can authenticate users directly, I can check policies that only apply to my systems, I can identify software and hardware, and I can do that all within the comfort of the bubble. It’s a small world that I can see and control. The bubble offers safety and familiarity, and we like&nbsp;that.</p> Foam <p>Bubbles don’t exist on their own, though, and that’s where the classical network thinking breaks down. It would be easy to say that a bubble is just a regular local network, disconnected from the world, but that doesn’t solve the most interesting problems. A single bubble might be a helpful concept, but it’s when we get a lot of bubbles together that things really get exciting, if you ask&nbsp;me.</p><p>Let’s take a user account as our example. We tend to think of an account as having a specific home, an authoritative source that binds the attributes and authenticators to a person (or other entity, if we’re feeling spicy). But those attributes and authenticators often come from somewhere, and that’s where the bubble concept really starts to&nbsp;shine.</p><p>I’m not just talking about just-in-time provisioning, where a central account database points to a new bubble and says “here is everyone that’s supposed to be in that bubble”. I do think that this kind of push is an important tool, but it can’t be the only one. Any developer will tell you that even the best distributed and delegated systems tend to accrete things like local accounts, group accounts, admin passwords, service keys, and other techniques that solve specific problems.</p><p>Instead of trying to engineer those kinds of things away, the bubble concept embraces the local-ness of them. Within the bubble, we want to authenticate and make our decisions locally. This lets us be fast and robust, and build in the kinds of things that we only care about here. But how do we balance that need against usability and account&nbsp;control?</p><p>When I’ve got a user in my system, they’ve got an account that exists only within the bubble. They can authenticate locally to an IdP or AS that is in charge of all the services within that bubble. The account has attributes and access controls that might only make sense to systems inside the bubble. But it would be obnoxious for a user to create a new local account by hand every time they needed to do something, even though that’s how we have solved this kind of thing in the past. This is the strength of federation technologies like OpenID Connect and credentialing systems like Verifiable Credentials — a user can show up and point back to an authoritative source for their attributes, and get an authenticated session out of the deal. We can use these to get the user inside the bubble, but instead of using these to log in every time, these technologies can be used to instantiate and bind an account within the bubble. From that point forward, the user can authenticate locally. If at any time in the future we need to verify the account with its source, we can re-run the same items we used at&nbsp;ingest.</p><p>And importantly, a bubble should be allowed to trust any other bubble as a source for information. There can be no strict hierarchy in reality. When my bubble is out in the world, I might have a very clear and immediate business need to trust people, information, and services from another bubble that I didn’t know about a few minutes ago. I should be able to make a local decision to trust a user that came from that bubble and bind them to an account in my own&nbsp;bubble.</p><p>This trust is also not linear. A user could have accounts, credentials, and artifacts from multiple places. It’s a common requirement in identity proofing to present evidence from multiple sources that corroborate your claims. In the same fashion, a user might show up with a VC from one issuer and an OIDC login from a different place. The combination of those things can be meaningful to the bubble in a unique&nbsp;way.</p><p>As the foam of distinct bubbles grows, it’s important to be able to trace provenance from these different bubbles. In our local policies, we need a way to say that “This is user A, they came to us from cloud B, but cloud B said they originally came from both cloud C and cloud D”, and be able to verify that chain. And since our bubble could be the authoritative source for some other bubble, we need a way to talk about that kind of chain downstream. These kinds of durable provenance artifacts aren’t simple, and they bring with them a whole host of privacy concerns — can an adversary use this to track an individual through a system that doesn’t want to be tracked? Can I troll around the network of bubbles and correlate all these points? It’s clear that being able to selectively disclose the provenance chain, as well as the data about the user themselves.</p> Turtles <p>A bubble can provide context for another bubble to exist. The bubbles can share part of their barriers, allowing specific trusted information to pass freely between them in a way that the external walls don’t, but stopping other information.</p><p>A bubble could also exist entirely within another bubble, acting as a sub-division. If we really do care about zero-trust security architectures, we’ll make our bubbles as small as possible and composable so we can stack concerns.</p><p>We’re starting to have this conversation on the IETF’s new <a href="https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/wimse">Workload Identity for Multi-System Environments (WIMSE)</a> mailing list. So if that kind of thing interests you, please join us&nbsp;there.</p> Flow <p>Bubbles offer us another helpful metaphor, in that they aren’t static. When you’ve got a bunch of bubbles floating around, they really don’t like to stay still. They move, connect, disconnect, and eventually even&nbsp;pop.</p><p>In a classical multi-lateral federation, the focus is always on getting all the online systems to talk to each other in a way that makes sense for the moment. A new university just signed the agreement? Get them into the directory! We’ve got a new deployable unit that’s heading into the field? Write down the serial number on that router and out the door you&nbsp;go.</p><p>But once we’re up and running, things change. New parties could get brought on locally, new services get pulled in as needed, and the entities that we once relied on cease to&nbsp;exist.</p><p>Disaster response gives us a great example here. In this case, we want to be able to stand up a new bubble of services in response to a specific event, time, and place. Specialists come in with qualifications. Some of these we can verify — you’re a doctor, I can see your medical license is good right now, triage tent is that way. You’re an electrician, your union card looks good, go jump on that truck. But sometimes people show up to help, and their presence in the situation is enough to warrant giving them access. You used to be a firefighter, ok grab an axe and make a firebreak up on that hill. You can answer phones and direct calls? Great, have a seat, here’s the switchboard and directory. We have a mix of accounts that get provisioned from the outside — the doctors and union electricians — and accounts that get provisioned locally — the firefighter and switchboard operator. All of these accounts are valuable for different reasons, and our systems need to have that level of flexibility.</p><p>And eventually, the disaster is over, and we need to clean up our data as much as the physical mess of the disaster. That firefighter went and accessed a bunch of stuff, were they supposed to see that? Those union electrical workers, were they actively in the union with valid licenses while they were down here, or had some of them been kicked out? And depending on what they did, does that matter to us? We need auditability and accountability for dynamic systems like this. We need to be able to call back to the union and say “hey someone used their credential from you and we let them do the following kinds of things, are you OK with that and are we OK with that?” It’s not an easy set of questions to answer, and it gets even more complex when we start chaining our systems together in unexpected ways.</p><p>These bubbles can also disconnect and re-connect to the greater foam. This is the value of the hyper-local decisions — once you’re on board, I don’t need to see your IdP all the time in order for you to log in. So if we go offline for a while, or your IdP goes offline for a while, that’s OK. But once we’re back online, I might want to check in with your IdP, especially if you’ve done something fishy inside my bubble. Cross-domain trust should come with cross-domain accountability.</p> It’s Not A Technology <p>I truly believe that no one technology will solve this, for the simple reason that we will never get the online world to agree to one standard to address things, no matter how good it is or how much nerds love it. Any solution that requires us all to speak the same single protocol is doomed to&nbsp;failure.</p><p>Reality is heterogeneous, and we need to build for that heterogeneous world. The real value, then, comes in defining the interconnects. Interoperability occurs for a purpose and in a context. I believe that we can use a family of standards and technologies in a common pattern to build our the future of internet connectivity.</p><p>As a consequence, in this space I see room for OpenID Connect, Verifiable Credentials, SCIM, Shared Signaling, TLS, SPIFFE, FIDO, and many other moving parts. The bubbles should provide a common set of connection points into the larger foam in which they exist. Not every bubble is going to use the same connection points, but each point provides a specific set of functionality and addresses a specific problem. Even inside the bubbles there’s room for a lot of flexibility and innovation — how do I connect and verify my internal services, how do I spin up subsystems, how do I know who’s there in the first&nbsp;place?</p><p>Some of you reading might be expecting the bottom of this article to be a pitch of my new stealthy start-up that solves all these problems with some magic product I’m trying to sell you, but I’m sorry to disappoint your CTO that it’s not going to just come off the shelf. In all truth, I don’t know exactly what this solution looks like, but I’m eager to start building it to see what’s out&nbsp;there.</p>

<p>My RSI (repetitive strain injury) struggles began 25 years ago, after an intensive push to build and ship the BYTE magazine website. The tendons in both wrists became badly inflamed, and I spent a couple of months in rehab: anti-inflammatory meds, alternating heat and ice, stretching. It mostly resolved, but my left thumb joint remained painful. One day, as I wondered what could possibly be the cause, I looked down at my hands as I was typing. I use the world’s <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2009/03/14/the-floating-arms-keyboard/">best</a> (and rarest) split keyboard so there’s a left spacebar and a right spacebar. Suddenly it was obvious. I was always hitting the left spacebar with my left thumb, an unconscious habit that was repeated hundreds or thousands of times a day. And I was really slamming it too, another habit that I still have to monitor. Thus began one of a series of interventions to remap the relationship between fingers and keys. In that case, I assigned my right thumb to the spacebar, intending to switch to an alternating pattern once things settled down. All these years later, I look down at my hands now and see that never happened. I’m still using the right spacebar exclusively. I should probably try to change that, but there’s a more pressing problem.</p>
<p>Over the years, I got bitten a few more times by the effects of asymmetry. When my left hand became painful again, I realized I was mousing exclusively with that hand, and switched the mouse to my right side. I think I’ve gone back and forth a few times, currently it’s again on the right.</p>
<p>Another time, when I was doing a lot of lap swimming, my right shoulder became painful. Once again, it was something that should have been obvious, but wasn’t to the medical people I consulted, and wasn’t to me either until, once again, I recognized another asymmetry: I was always breathing on the left side, which put extra strain on the right shoulder. When I switched to an alternating pattern, breathing every third stroke instead of every second, that problem resolved.</p>
<p>You’d think I’d have learned my lesson by now. But when the knuckle of my left pinky suddenly became inflamed two months ago, it was the same story all over again. I attributed it to playing more guitar than usual, but when laying off didn’t help I thought I might have triggered arthritis. An x-ray was negative, though. What could it possibly be?</p>
<p>Then last night, while typing, I felt a twinge and looked down at my hands. It was blindingly obvious: I use emacs key mappings; the CTRL key is part of many of the basic chords; my poor left pinky is overloaded. Amping up the guitar playing probably pushed me over the edge, but it seems clear that is the root cause.</p>
<p>So I’m typing this post in order to adjust to yet another remapping. On this keyboard, there’s also a right CTRL key but it’s not convenient to my right pinky, so I’ve recruited the right SHIFT key (which I apparently never use) to be my new CTRL key. It’s not going to be an easy adjustment, but I won’t complain, I’m just glad to know I’ve found the way forward.</p>
<p>Given these experiences, I’ve thought a lot about how we can unconsciously injure ourselves with repetitive and asymmetric patterns of movement. In my case, I don’t seem to receive any signals until damage is already done. I wish I could notice sooner, do the necessary remapping, and continue with less disruption. But it just doesn’t seem to work that way. </p>
<p>I really can’t complain, though. Recently I met a guy in a guitar shop whose left wrist and hand became so painful that he had to switch sides and learn to fret with his right hand. It’s hard for me to conceive of doing that kind of remapping, but you do what you have to do. And as a bonus, he’s now a switch-hitter: as he recovers some use of his left hand, he finds that he can achieve different effects as a right-handed and left-handed player.</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure I’ll get through this episode. The question will then become: how to avoid the next one? When we use computer keyboards or musical instruments, we need our hands to work unconsciously and automatically. It’s only when injuries happen that we have to surface what’s been unconscious, enter manual mode, and retrain until we can form new unconscious habits. I wish there were an early warning system.</p>

 A Eulogy for a&nbsp;Game <p>Family, friends, and fellow CT&nbsp;members,</p><p>Today, we bid a heartfelt farewell to a beloved game that won our hearts in 2018, TCR Party. This game managed to carve a niche, transforming how we looked at token-curated registries, incentive models, and abstracted on-chain interactions.</p><p>TCR Party was not just an ordinary game but a masterpiece of community spirit. As we remember and celebrate its existence — a noble quest to curate a list of the 100 most influential Crypto Twitter accounts — it wasn’t just about gaining followers or amassing likes, but about the friends we made along the way. Hell, we even got a CoinDesk article out of it (thanks,&nbsp;Leigh).</p><p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2019/02/08/tcr-party-the-cryptotwitter-popularity-contest-everyones-talking-about/">TCR Party: The #CryptoTwitter Popularity Contest Everyone's Talking About</a></p><p>TCR Party was not just about the numbers; it was about the people. Yet, as with all good things, the time has come to say goodbye to TCR Party. But let us not be saddened by its departure. Instead, let us cherish the memories of the camaraderie we shared, the knowledge we gained, and the impact it&nbsp;had.</p><p>Rest in peace, TCR Party. Your mark on the space shall never be forgotten.</p><p>Let me offer a brief introduction for those who don't know what any of this&nbsp;means.</p> Token Curated Registries (TCRs) <p>For those who are entirely new here, the first thing that should be explained are Token Curated Registries (TCRs).</p><p>TCRs were initially proposed by Mike Goldin as a way to have a decentralized set of actors essentially curate a list. This could be any form of information — be it something subjective such as a grocery list, a list of “noteworthy projects,” or even a more enforceable registry such as an allowlist or blocklist for a&nbsp;forum.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@ilovebagels/token-curated-registries-1-0-61a232f8dac7">Token-Curated Registries 1.0</a></p><p>Actions in this system involve nominating, voting, and challenging existing registry items, all controlled through token voting. The incentives and involved parties are structured as the following:</p>  Self-interested curators (token holders) create a valuable list to increase the value of their voting&nbsp;power.  Candidates that wish to be curated into “important” lists would effectively buy or petition their way onto the registry.  Consumers desire a trustworthy north star for curated information.  <p>There are also additional incentive systems that keep people from making bad decisions, such as a failed nomination slashing the bond put in place to make that nomination in the first place. In this case, token holders are incentivized to keep the information on the list as noteworthy and “valuable” as possible to keep the system running and their holdings worth something.</p><p>But what makes information “valuable?” Does it actually have to be truthful?</p> The Half-Truth in&nbsp;TCRs <p>Although TCRs set out to curate objective information for the sake of the value of the list, this is often marred by personal opinions, bribery, conspiracy, and plain old trolling. For a TCR to produce an objective list, you would need highly motivated specialists doing the curation&nbsp;that:</p>  Care enough about the issue and have a wide enough audience to broadcast to,  Are willing to put financial assets on the line in these&nbsp;cases,  And are willing to morally be above bribery in the case of short-term payouts at the expense of more significant long-term gains.  <p>I still think (considering the maturity of the technology and the general interest of folks) that TCRs aren’t an excellent idea for curating meaningful, objective truth. This is why projects like <a href="http://www.coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/02/media-startup-civil-shuts-down-team-absorbed-into-decentralized-id-efforts-at-consensys/">Civil</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/trustory-app/why-trustory-is-shutting-down-6d50175628eb">TruStory</a> were both dead on&nbsp;arrival.</p><p>In a wackier case, there was once even a proposal to name members voted onto a TCR as an oracle of an event’s outcome for a decentralized predictions market (in this case, not having a central reporting mechanism). However, due to a few more reasons around the scale of the event being reported on and plain old apathy, I wrote about this entire case a few years&nbsp;ago:</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/alpineintel/on-tcrs-and-predictions-markets-counterweights-and-collusion-408d03ab7090">On TCRs and Predictions Markets: Counterweights and Collusion</a></p><p>In short, I don’t believe TCRs can be helpful mechanisms for curating objective information. However, I believe they can play a part in making useful hyper-subjective lists, typically in art curation or even popularity contests. Subjectivity and opinions would make them practical for popularity contests because of how motivated people are in the case of low-stakes games for personal satisfaction. This is what sparked the idea for TCR&nbsp;Party.</p> TCR Party <p>I originally invented TCR Party while on the Alpine team at ConsenSys, led by <a href="https://twitter.com/wycdd">Wayne Chang</a>. I wanted to experiment with subjectivity and curation based on the above&nbsp;thesis.</p><p>My first thought was: “What’s the most contentious, opinionated, and drama-filled place on the internet with a relevant audience?” The answer was Twitter. In this case, we would use the entirety of Crypto Twitter to curate a list of the top 100 Crypto Twitter accounts to follow. We would also call it “TCR Party” to give it an air of exclusivity — or a party you wished to be invited&nbsp;to.</p><p>TCR Party had to be abstracted, encourage subjective opinions, and fuel a popularity contest. One of the first things we did was abstract away any need to interface with wallets or a public blockchain directly by instead using Twitter as the primary user interface.</p><p>Twitter was typically where all crypto discourse was happening, and users were quite familiar with existing design patterns on the site. Therefore, we used bots to be both the relay for the curated list, and to handle all the interactions that involved public blockchains. I still wonder if it could be considered the first experiment in account abstraction because it used Twitter accounts to control wallets and handle transactions on your&nbsp;behalf.</p> How it&nbsp;Looked <p>The first step in the process was interfacing with the @<a href="https://twitter.com/TCRPartyVIP">TCRPartyVIP</a> bot, which handled account generation and all on-chain actions on behalf of the user. This was initiated by Tweeting “Hey @TCRPartyVIP let’s party,” which would start the conversation with the bot. We figured this would initiate a fun viral feedback loop, where those who weren’t sure what was going on would Tweet the same message to join in on what was happening.</p><p>After that, the bot would set up your account, and you can then start nominating, challenging, or voting using simple DMs to the bot, such as “nominate @example” which would then initiate the&nbsp;action.</p><p>This bot was also responsible for continually posting updates about the on-chain activity. Any time there was a nomination, removal, or vote, the bot would Tweet the outcome or event as it happened.</p><p>We ultimately made the game’s asset inflationary to encourage continued participation (because voting with more strength required hitting the faucet daily). The bot would distribute 100 tokens daily if you told it “faucet.” We went with the Rinkeby testnet at the time because it was simple to use and easy to minimize all the on-chain transaction costs. In this case, the user could always continue to play the game without worrying about funding the generated wallet. We did consider a world where the game was on mainnet, and users could essentially “eject” from the system and control their own assets — but we felt it wasn’t necessary at the time to carry out the experiment.</p><p>Finally, the game was centered on popularity for a reason — it kept people coming back, and gave them the chance to be curated on a list alongside other popular accounts. For four years, <a href="https://twitter.com/TCRPartyBot">@TCRPartyBot</a> was responsible for amplifying each list member by retweeting any of their tweets. In this case, TCRPartyVIP could continue to post about challenges, nominations, and votes, while TCRPartyBot could be just the curation&nbsp;output.</p><p>The game ended up curating quite a decent list of characters over time, and even as the interest in TCR Party dried up, and we paused development on it, TCRPartyBot kept retweeting that&nbsp;list.</p> Not Dead Just&nbsp;Yet <p>The most important part of TCR Party’s development was making the <a href="https://gitlab.com/alpinefresh/tcr-party/contracts">contracts</a>, <a href="https://gitlab.com/alpinefresh/tcr-party/leaderboard">leaderboard</a>, <a href="https://gitlab.com/alpinefresh/tcr-party/tcrpartybot">Twitter bot</a>, and even the <a href="https://gitlab.com/alpinefresh/tcr-party/www.tcr.party">website</a> open source, so anyone can take TCR Party and make their own&nbsp;game.</p><p>All that would need to happen is a relaunch of all the components and someone to subsidize the testnet assets required to keep the machine running (or mainnet if someone is so generous). A new system launch would likely be smoother, considering how easy it is to spin up a new blockchain with enough speed and low enough cost to keep it&nbsp;simple.</p><p>I encourage anyone interested to pick it up and keep the party going. Who knows — maybe I’ll relaunch&nbsp;it.</p><p>Party on.</p>

reports
that: 
 
 User engagement on Threads has continued to fall after an initial surge in sign-ups …
the number of daily active users [has fallen] to 13 million, down about 70% from a

  <p>The Wall Street Journal
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/threads-user-engagement-continues-to-drop-adding-urgency-for-new-features-8ed2f384">reports</a>
that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>User engagement on Threads has continued to fall after an initial surge in sign-ups …
the number of daily active users [has fallen] to 13 million, down about 70% from a
July 7 peak, according to estimates from market intelligence firm Sensor Tower.
The average time users spend on the iOS and Android apps has also decreased to four minutes
from 19 minutes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s quite a bit different than the headlines of “fastest app growth in history”
and “more than 100 million accounts in a week”. It was always clear that only a fraction
of those initial users were going to stick around, but more concerning – from Meta’s point of
view – is that decrease in time spent with the app by the users that do continue to
use the app: from 19 minutes to four minutes is a very significant decline.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the (open) Fediverse, however, I think this is very good news:</p>
 
 At these numbers, Threads is still significantly larger than the rest of the Fediverse
combined, but far less so than it looked like a week ago. There was a possibility that
Meta would simply drop their plans to implement ActivityPub, or just do a very rudimentary
job, because why would you spend much attention on this if all you can connect to is
a network 1% the size of your own. At 10-20%, as it looks like right now, that
argument is very different. 
 Rather than leaning back, and celebrating its success, Meta now needs to work hard
to compete with Twitter. (And Twitter will have to compete back.) That is good for
the world in general, and indirectly good for the Fediverse as the “market” for text-based
microblogs is suddenly competitive again. People realize they have at least two
(well-marketed) choices; it’s not a foregone conclusion that “Twitter owns this”.
If there are two choices, maybe there are three of four, including the non-Meta Fediverse. 
 And perhaps, as a side effect of all of this, some of the dollars being spent may find
their way into the Fediverse. Certainly Meta is now even more incentivized to highlight
Threads’ differences with Twitter, and key to that is ActivityPub. I would think that
should make them more willing, rather than less, to spend a bit of money on Fediverse
infrastructure, like a test suite, that benefits the entire network. 
 Of course, it’s also good news for everybody who had been concerned that Threads would
overwhelm the culture of the Fediverse the same way AOL overwhelmed in the culture
of Usenet in the nineties. 
 
<p>(Note: I am in favor of Meta implementing ActivityPub in Threads; in fact I would like it to
implement it in all of its social media properties, and messenger services like WhatsApp
– or perhaps a similar protocol like Matrix. I believe the same for non-Meta apps like
LinkedIn, YouTube etc.</p>
<p>IMHO, the ability to interoperate across platforms is a major disinfectant, and can be a
major factor in reducing product lock-in, which can lead to better products, more
choices, and fewer “forced” policies like privacy invasions, because users have the
ability to go elsewhere. I understand those Fediverse users who do not want to
touch anything that Meta does and sympathize; the good news is that you, as a user,
have unprecedented control in the Fediverse over who you do and do not want to interact
with, and more power to you if you exercise that control.)</p>

Although I’ve spent decades working with software, and still regularly write code in one form or another, I’m only an average programmer. There’s no doubt that LLM assistants can help me be better. But how much better? In what ways exactly? That’s what I aim to find out. My day job embeds me in a fast-moving open-source project, <a href="https://steampipe.io">Steampipe</a>, to which I want to contribute as much as I can. That ambition was, until recently, tempered by my own limitations. Now, augmented by the collective knowledge embodied in LLM assistants, I’m raising my sights. Larry Wall famously said: “Easy things should be easy, and hard things should be possible.” It’s starting to look like even hard things can be easy. But the devil’s in the details, so in this series I’ll focus on concrete examples of how LLM assistants do (and don’t) help me become a better developer.</p>

<p>Dealing with privacy issues isn’t as simple as the tech (and all too often the security) industry thinks. There are some real challenges and ethical conundrums to deal with, and we ignore the reality of the society into which our products are going at our own peril. We are seeing this happen full force right now with AI. In their fear of being left behind, all too many companies are throwing AI into the mix with the old “build ship fast and break things” mentality. Especially surprising in the identity industry given that we have seen how much of a negative impact that can have.</p>



<p>Doing all we can to preventing tragedies like the one below requires multiple changes in how we build products. I can’t claim to know all the answers. But I do know it starts with putting together diverse teams (which means bringing those who live these threats into the design process). Incorporating abusability testing is key, and there is a clear need for applied ethics.</p>

<p>Web 7.0 is a universal, open-source solution for the Internet’s digital identity and trust problems.</p>



<a href="https://hyperonomy.files.wordpress.com/2023/07/image.png"></a>



<p>The Internet was created 40 years ago. The World Wide Web application, running on top of the Internet, was created more than 30 years ago. Neither the Internet nor the WWW included built-in support for each person to have their own unique, universal digital identity and, hence, no built-in ability to support secure, authentic, and trusted communications. Every website and mobile app was left to develop, test, and manage its own digital identity solution.</p>



<p>Web 7.0 is a universal, open-source solution for the Internet’s digital identity and trust problems.

 The Dawn of Organizational Identity, Part 2: Credentials <p>Co-authored by Stephan Wolf, CEO of GLEIF. Thanks to the dozens of smart people who contributed their time and insights.</p><p><a href="https://rufftimo.medium.com/the-dawn-of-decentralized-organizational-identity-part-1-identifiers-ffb9091fd47a">Part 1</a> described the first component of Organizational Identity (OI): identifiers. Part 2 describes the second component of OI — organizational credentials — the things that bring OI its most exciting and transformative capability: verifiable authority.</p> Organizational Credentials <p>Organizational Credentials (OCs) enable representatives of an organization to prove their authority to represent the organization outside its boundaries to anyone, anywhere. Critically, OCs enable this without using identity providers (IDPs), blockchains, or shared platforms. Instead, OCs are fully decentralized, utilizing free and open key management protocols at the edges of interactions instead of depending on a centralized intermediary or common master database, ledger, or registry in the middle. More on that&nbsp;later.</p><p>Mechanically, OCs cryptographically bind a natural person or thing to their organizational attributes. OCs specifically pronounce and make proveable the authority, roles, rights, and responsibilities of organizational representatives. OCs also prove the identity of the representative and organization being represented, and cryptographically bind them together so that all three elements — the organization, the identity of the representative, and the authority attributes of the representative — are instantly verifiable anywhere, online or&nbsp;off.</p> Unlimited Use&nbsp;Cases <p>The use cases for OCs are endless, and profound. OCs make possible all the dreamy things mentioned at the beginning of Part 1. Because they’re important, here they are again with a few&nbsp;changes:</p> B2B Examples   Authorized representatives will digitally sign documents, contracts, purchase orders, and attestations; recipients of those signatures will instantly verify signers’ authority (and some digital documents will prevent signing without the expected authority);  The origin, chain of custody, and authority of a legitimate document, agreement, filing, or piece of data will be instantly verifiable as authentic and un-tampered with;  Phone calls, texts, email, and other digital communications originating from authorized representatives (or devices) of an organization — or any delegate of that organization — will be instantly verifiable, as will the authority of the originating representative;  The authority of every approval, signature, or other digital action in a supply chain will be instantly verifiable by downstream actors, and auditable in real-time;  Login by employees, contractors, customers and constituents will become passwordless and based on authority and entitlement, not passwords or&nbsp;devices;  Impersonation and ID theft of authorized representatives will become more difficult for fraudsters;  Security breaches will become shorter, less frequent and less impactful, as organizations adopt more robust OI and key management strategies;  And on and&nbsp;on.   B2C and C2B&nbsp;Examples   AI/bots will prove legitimacy by non-repudiably digitally signing all content they&nbsp;produce;  Organizations will instantly recognize their customers and constituents when they call in, log in, or walk in, enabling superior customer experiences without sacrificing security or&nbsp;privacy;  People will verify that a business or government representative contacting them has the authority they&nbsp;claim;  Access controls — both physical and digital — will become more granular and&nbsp;secure;  A car (and its driver) will wirelessly verify the authority of approaching law enforcement or emergency vehicles, and be granted preferential access, terms, or parking benefits for being&nbsp;local;  A contracted delivery driver can use a one-time-use OC to open a&nbsp;gate;  And on and&nbsp;on.   Protocols, Not Platforms = Fully Decentralized = No Boundaries <p>As mentioned above, OCs are verifiable anywhere — even outside the physical or digital boundaries where the organization exists, such as a network, state, country, or even group of countries — without using IDPs or other ‘trusted’ intermediaries, blockchains, or shared platforms.</p><p>Platform-based models require that verifiers ‘phone home’ to some trusted platform to perform verifications, similar to how Facebook users meet on the Facebook platform, LinkedIn users on LinkedIn, Twitter, Tiktok, and so on. If there’s an anointed/accredited provider or group of providers at the center of an identity ecosystem through which all interactions must pass, it’s a centralized platform limited in its usefulness to those who directly trust the particular provider(s) and subject to continuous digital surveillance.</p><p>By using open, standard, decentralizing protocols instead of platforms, OCs allow each side of an interaction to use any service provider they choose or build their own tooling, rather than having a platform in the middle that both sides of an interaction must use and trust. Take the example of email: when email was first invented, both senders and receivers needed to use the same platform to exchange messages — AOL, Compuserve, Prodigy, etc. After the introduction of the decentralizing SMTP protocol, however, email senders and receivers could each hire a separate service provider or host their own server, and still exchange email messages with anyone. Other examples of decentralizing protocols include TCP/IP, HTTP,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>Since the majority of OC users will likely buy tools from service providers instead of building their own, as with email, it is a big advantage that OCs allow counterparties to independently hire and fire their own service providers without losing the ability to successfully interact, no matter where in the world each party may&nbsp;be.</p><p>This separation not only enables ubiquitous verifiability, it solves a gaping privacy problem inherent with platform-based identity systems: the dreaded ‘phone home’ mentioned above that enables surveillance everywhere the digital identities are used, even if proponents say “we’re not implementing it that way” (yet). This separation also decentralizes valuable identity data at the edges rather than aggregating it into a tempting treasure trove in the middle, held by one or an anointed few central identity providers.</p><p>A few quick thoughts about blockchain… Blockchain, from a data standpoint, results from implementing a centralizing protocol, as it inescapably results in a single, master set of data that all counterparties must agree to (unlike TCP/IP, HTTP, etc.). While a blockchain’s data is physically replicated across many physical locations, the only semi-decentralized aspect of blockchain is its governance, but only when that governance is permissionless, and even then it is questionable.¹ Every aspect of permissioned blockchains is centralized, putting all data into a single logical ledger and governance into the hands of a chosen few. The point here is, blockchains in all their flavors are platforms, not protocols, and always result in data centralization, the opposite of what’s needed for globally verifiable OCs.</p><p>(Learn more about the centralizing aspects of platforms and decentralizing aspects of protocols in the seminal essay “<a href="https://knightcolumbia.org/content/protocols-not-platforms-a-technological-approach-to-free-speech">Protocols, Not Platforms</a>”, by Mike Masnick.)</p> OCs are Verifiable Credentials: Shipping Containers for&nbsp;Data <p>OCs can do everything that VCs (verifiable credentials) can do because OCs are VCs — though OCs are not reliant on blockchains or web security, as most VCs are (more on that below). VCs and OCs are like shipping containers for data: put any data inside a digital container, seal it up (by digitally signing it), send it anywhere, and a recipient anywhere can open it and instantly verify who created it and that it hasn’t been tampered with, revoked, or expired since it was&nbsp;issued.</p><p>To be doubly clear: an OC or VC does not prove its data payload to be true or correct, OCs and VCs prove the payload’s provenance (who originated it, who else endorsed it) and integrity (hasn’t been tampered with, expired, or revoked).</p><p>Because VCs are digital they can be presented and verified over and over again, and their security can be made to be quite high, depending on how they’re implemented. Bottom line: VCs make verifiable data portable, and OCs use that portability to prove authority delegated from an organization to a representative, whether a person or a&nbsp;thing.</p><p>(Read more about the foundational breakthrough of VCs in a three-part series Timothy wrote&nbsp;<a href="https://rufftimo.medium.com/verifiable-credentials-arent-credentials-they-re-containers-fab5b3ae5c0">here</a>.)</p> OCs Use Second-Generation Verifiable Credentials <p>First-generation VCs, like the current VC JSON-LD standard at W3C or the emerging JWT standard at IETF, were developed with utility for individuals in mind, for proving relatively less complex things like identity, age, and academic credentials. They were and are a major breakthrough in digital identity, they’re what make ‘self-sovereign identity’ actually self-sovereign and ‘decentralized identity’ actually decentralized, by giving individuals a high degree of autonomy.</p><p>Second-generation VCs were developed with organizational use cases in mind, with all the capabilities of first-generation credentials plus sophisticated new capabilities that individuals don’t often need but organizations often do, such as key pre-rotation and recovery, delegability, multi-signature (“multi-sig”), contractually protected disclosure, freedom from blockchain/‘ledger lock’, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>These new organizational capabilities are made possible by a form of VCs called “Authentic Chained Data Containers” (<a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ssmith-acdc-02.html">ACDCs</a>), with signing and verification using a free, open key management protocol that replaces the need for blockchain or vulnerable web-based security: Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (<a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/ietf-keri">KERI</a>). These two decentralizing protocols together — ACDCs and KERI — deliver significant advances for VCs, the kind that organizations require and that justify the ‘second-generation’ moniker.</p><p>Here are seven highlights:</p><p>1. Extraordinary advances in security:</p>  Recovery from key compromise (suspected or actual) without reissuance of previously signed&nbsp;items*  Key pre-rotation without re-issuance of previously signed&nbsp;items*  No reliance on web&nbsp;security  Privacy-respecting verifiable revocation  Non-repudiable signing with&nbsp;logging  Post-quantum proof*  Natively supports weighted ‘m-of-n’ multi-sig schemes with fractionally weighted thresholds (e.g., 2-of-3’, or 1-of-3 when the 1 has sufficient ‘weight’, etc.)  <p>2. No reliance on blockchain (and its limitations: “ledger-lock”/centralization, scalability, cost, complexity, interoperability, performance, privacy, security, etc.)</p><p>3. Use of existing cloud infrastructure and&nbsp;APIs</p><p>4. Multi-level issuance with chaining and delegation (anyone having authority can delegate and extend a chain of authority, rather than all delegates returning to the ‘mother ship’ for single-level, single-signer issuance)</p><p>5. Graduated disclosure (granular, legally enforceable privacy and disclosure capabilities):</p>  Selective disclosure*  Contractually protected disclosure (parties verifiably consent to terms of disclosure prior to disclosure)  Contingent disclosure (i.e., escrowed)  <p>6. Interoperable with anything using the same underlying protocols (without sharing blockchains, vendors, registries, databases, etc.)</p><p>7. Simpler; technically lighter-weight (not verbose, compared to first-gen VCs)</p><p>*Individuals need these,&nbsp;too.</p> Security First,&nbsp;Always <p>With second-generation VCs, security comes first, always, no exceptions. The security advances with second-generation VCs are stunning when you consider that key recovery and rotation are still the Achilles Heel not only of first generation VCs, but also of blockchain and existing web infrastructure generally. Second-generation VCs using KERI don’t just fix <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/VC_Enhancement_Strategy.md">security flaws for VCs</a> (especially web-based VCs), they’re a significant advance in digital security, period.</p> Come on In, the Water’s&nbsp;Warm <p>There are no significant technical reasons we are aware of not to advance to second-generation VCs — no notable trade-offs other than familiarity and switching costs from legacy systems. In fact, the complexity of blockchain-based first-generation VCs may be at least an order of magnitude greater than the more elegant, advanced, and blockchain-less second-generation VCs.</p><p>That said, some will reasonably argue that a second-generation of VCs that doesn’t directly and fully interoperate with first-generation VCs — which is true — is a step backward rather than forward. However, we feel that achieving interoperability of VCs that are insecure, reliant on blockchain or web infrastructure, and not stress tested in production at scale is a hollow victory, and premature; it is not meaningful interoperability. Security — in the form of proper key management — must come first; it cannot be bolted onto the current VC model just like it cannot be bolted onto the internet after the fact; there is no way around&nbsp;this.</p><p>However, the good news is, with second-generation VCs we can have our cake and eat it, too: we can have all the robust security capabilities described above, plus <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/SPAC_Message.md">advances in privacy</a> simply not possible with first-generation VCs, and gain real, global, fully decentralized interoperability that only standardized non-platform-based protocols can deliver. Even then, serious work on interoperability should be undertaken only after some use cases have made it into production and demonstrated that all these things work well, at scale. Otherwise that would be premature interoperability, too.</p> The Unprecedented Power of OCs Using Second-Generation VCs <p>Some of the dreamy use cases for OCs listed above are already possible, you say…&nbsp;but:</p>  Unlike most current identity technologies, OCs require no surveillance-enabling, privacy-killing ‘phone home’ to an intermediary for verification, do not rely on DNS/web security, and do not use shared ledgers/blockchains; OCs sacrifice neither security nor&nbsp;privacy.  OCs can convey the full provenance and details of authority — unlimited levels — in-band with verification, proving not only the authority of the representative, but the full chain of authority and where it originated.  OCs are also B2C, helping prevent phishing by proving to customers and constituents that the company or government representative they’re interacting with really represents whom they claim to represent.  OCs are also C2B, enabling customers and constituents to prove their identity, status, and entitlements to the businesses and governments they’re aligned with when they call in, log in, or walk&nbsp;in.  OCs can prove provenance not only back to the top of an organization, but to GLEIF (described in <a href="https://rufftimo.medium.com/the-dawn-of-decentralized-organizational-identity-part-1-identifiers-ffb9091fd47a">Part 1</a>) and/or to any other chained root of trust such as a city, state, nation, or group of&nbsp;nations.  OCs can also make verifiable any other analog identifiers in addition to or instead of the LEI. For example, a national ID, regional ID, local ID, employee ID, and any other identifiers could become cryptographically verifiable with OCs (provided their inclusion is governed by rules and safeguards similar to GLEIF’s <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/vlei/introducing-the-vlei-ecosystem-governance-framework">Ecosystem Governance Framework</a>, see&nbsp;below).  <p>When an authorized representative of an organization delegates some authority to a person or a thing, whether an employee, director, contractor, partner, customer, constituent, device or piece of software — no matter how many levels deep in the organization — OCs enable that person or thing to prove it digitally, instantly, securely, and globally. OCs are a game-changer.</p> It’s All About Authority  Delegable Authority <p>An organization is a hierarchy of delegated authority, from the very top to the very bottom. When a legal entity is founded it appeals to the state or other jurisdiction where it exists, which grants it the authority to organize itself and operate legally under applicable regulations and the rules of its founding documents. An org’s founding documents provide the rules by which founders and top executives relate to each other and which roles have which authority; all other roles and authority are delegated from&nbsp;there.</p><p>Janitors have authority to enter buildings at times or in places others cannot, and fast food workers have authority to enter the building, wear the uniform, and use the equipment. Every role within an organization, whether public or private, has some degree of authority to represent that organization, no matter how small, that can be traced back to an organization’s top representatives and founding documents. Even customers have authority to log into their accounts, enter physical or virtual venues, or have other privileges bestowed by their virtue of being a customer, with elevated privileges for highly valued customers. Contractors have authority to perform the services for which they were contracted, which sometimes include access to certain systems or facilities, and on and&nbsp;on.</p><p>It’s all some form of delegated authority.</p><p>In a business context this proof of delegated authority is essential for engaging in business transactions. This is the major difference compared to identity schemes for individuals. In a business context you need to prove that Stephan Wolf is GLEIF’s CEO; age, eye color, private address etc. are not needed, evidence that he’s the CEO is. Quite likely, OCs will become more important than an individual’s digital identity alone, at least in a business&nbsp;context.</p> Proof of Delegated Authority <p>It’s one thing to have authority, quite another to prove it. OCs enable global verification of a representative’s delegated authority — through unlimited levels of delegation — using a powerful capability of second-generation VCs: chaining.</p><p>Chaining enables multiple levels of signatures for the same credential, and also for authority to be conveyed from signature to signature and/or credential to credential, enabling the very last link in the chain of delegated authority to be as strongly provable as the&nbsp;first.</p><p>A janitor can prove his authority with a cryptographic chain of delegated authority in the OC he carries. When verified by someone (or something) he’s presented his OC to, the chain might look like&nbsp;this:</p>  the janitor got his authority to do X and Y&nbsp;from  the facilities manager, whose authority came&nbsp;from  the regional manager, whose authority came&nbsp;from  the vice president, whose authority came&nbsp;from  the president/COO, whose authority came&nbsp;from  the CEO, who was issued a vLEI credential* by  the Qualified vLEI Issuer (QVI)* that vetted the organization, who was qualified by  the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF), a global root of trust for legal entity identification.  <p>* Described below.</p><p>The authority for the janitor begins with the CEO of the organization, originating from a special root-level OC that he/she holds, and not with GLEIF or its QVI. A CEO credential received from a QVI is not a delegation of authority; it is a digitally signed, non-repudiable attestation that the holder of that credential really is the CEO, issued by an accredited QVI or other reputable issuer after a rigorous vetting process. What the CEO does with the credential from thereon has nothing to do with the fact that an external entity asserts that he/she really is the CEO, and has digitally signed that assertion so that it’s verifiable anywhere.</p> Roots of&nbsp;Trust <p>A “root of trust” is a verifiable ultimate source of credibility for an OC that gives downstream verifiers confidence that the OC was really issued by the claimed organization.</p><p>As discussed in detail in Part 1, GLEIF makes an ideal global root of trust, but they aren’t the only one and the need for verifiability isn’t always global: any organization or authority can become its own root of trust and start issuing OCs without asking permission from anyone else; OCs are all open source and open standard under the hood. For OCs to become broadly acceptable within a state or province, for example, the root of trust for those OCs must be broadly trusted in the physical world throughout that state or province, and it must publish a comprehensive governance framework for its OC issuance process. (More on governance frameworks below.)</p><p>When downstream verifiers trust the root of a chain, they can more easily trust the OC presented at the end of the chain. If a state or province becomes its own root of trust, the example from above could continue like&nbsp;this:</p>  the CEO’s authority came&nbsp;from  the board of directors, whose authority came&nbsp;from  the most recent shareholder vote, which was authorized by  the articles of incorporation as attested&nbsp;by  a legal officer of the company, whose authority came&nbsp;from  the state or provincial registry of legal organizations, which  vetted the organization and issued the credential.  <p>Of course, the world sometimes is more complex than that and not as cleanly hierarchical, and OCs allow modeling of more complicated real-world scenarios, while still emanating from a trusted root. For example, a regional manager might be the CEO of a legal entity in Country A, but also report to a vice president of the parent company which is a legal entity in Country B. In this case, the CEO of the subsidiary would have the subsidiary’s LEI in its OC, which is linked to the LEIs of the direct and ultimate parent companies (using GLEIF lingo here). Chained OCs could easily be created to reflect this special delegation of authority, with each chain easily verifiable back to a GLEIF root of&nbsp;trust.</p><p>The same chaining flexibility for OCs applies to any chosen root of&nbsp;trust.</p> Binding Flesh to&nbsp;Digital <p>OCs are like ornaments on a tree: they hang from a branch attached to a trunk grown from a root. The root-level OCs are the first ones held by the organization, the highest level of authority from which all other lesser authority is delegated.</p><p>So how does the root start? How does an organization get its first, root-level OC?</p> The First/Root-Level OC: the&nbsp;vLEI <p>Organizational Credentials (OCs) are a specific kind of Verifiable Credential (VC), and the vLEI is a specific kind of OC, the first OC held by an organization that becomes the root of all others. So, the vLEI is an OC which is a VC. The relationships between them can be represented as concentric circles:</p><p>This means that OCs are compatible with and subject to VC standards such as those from IETF, W3C, and eventually, ISO. This also means that standards-compliant apps, wallets, and administrative tools should, eventually, work with OCs. We say “should” and “eventually” because the standards efforts are well underway but not yet concluded, and even when they are, some standards-compliant VCs and tools may not support all of the capabilities mentioned here, such as delegation (it’s possible to do OCs without delegation, but clumsy), multi-sig, key recovery, and key rotation. The OCs that will always have the capabilities mentioned here utilize second-generation VCs powered by KERI and ACDC protocols, as second-generation VCs were designed from the ground up to deliver these capabilities for organizations.</p> Stop! Before Issuing a Single&nbsp;OC… <p>A tree is only as secure as its root. This is why the issuance of an organization’s first, root-level credentials must be done with utmost care, with planning, preparation, and above all, security.</p><p>The open protocols underlying OCs do not force security to be done properly, but as described above, they enable the establishment of a foundational digital security posture for the organization that would be the envy of anything currently found in Web2, Web3, Web5,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>For example, GLEIF’s Ecosystem Governance Framework (described in the next section) recommends taking full-advantage of OC’s multi-sig capabilities by establishing signing thresholds with all root-level credentials. Otherwise, lost or compromised keys or a rogue representative at the root level could be catastrophic; it would be foolish to be exposed to this risk when avoiding it is relatively simple. These thresholds can be ‘m-of-n’, such as 1-of-2, 3-of-5, and so on, with added weighting for representatives with more authority. Sole proprietors can establish multi-sig across multiple devices, as can anyone else in a signing&nbsp;group.</p><p>The actual process of issuance to the multi-sig configuration of an organization must be done carefully. When a Qualified vLEI issuer (QVI) in the GLEIF ecosystem issues a vLEI, for example, it does so within a carefully orchestrated ceremony only after the organization has been fully vetted (through the LEI issuance process). Organizational representatives must also be rigorously vetted, both for their identity and their authority; a GLEIF QVI inspects company formation and other relevant documents to ensure this. Then there’s the use of secure video and audio connections, secure messaging, secure wallets, and&nbsp;more.</p> The Key to Trusting OCs: Governance Frameworks <p>In reviewing the draft of this post, Steven Milstein, the Vice Chair of the Governance Stack Working Group at the Trust over IP Foundation, made this insightful comment:</p><p>“OI &amp; OCs are only as strong as their published Governance Framework. And that framework is only as robust as the technologies that implement it. The more significant the gap between the framework and the underlying code, the greater the risk [Verifiers and Issuers]&nbsp;assume.”</p><p>Bold words, and we agree with them. The technology underpinning OCs makes the credential verifiable, but it’s the governance framework that makes it trustworthy. The distinction is&nbsp;crucial:</p><p>Verifiable: can cryptographically verify four things: 1. who issued by; 2. who issued to (optional); 3. not tampered with; 4. not revoked or expired. As mentioned earlier, verification does NOT provide any judgment about the data payload inside the OC, whether it is true, correct, complete, or anything else, it only confirms who issued it and that it hasn’t been changed or revoked since issuance. The data inside could be gibberish… authentic gibberish.</p><p>Trustworthy: trustworthy means that you know and trust the issuer of the OC, and/or you trust the process by which the OC was issued because the process itself has been vetted to meet a standard that you trust. That process is a governance framework.</p><p>For example, the first governance framework for OI in existence, GLEIF’s <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/vlei/introducing-the-vlei-ecosystem-governance-framework">Ecosystem Governance Framework</a> (EGF), provides guidance for vLEI issuance, which takes full advantage of the security capabilities of second-generation VCs. How these steps are followed and by whom is critically important to ensure the process is thorough and has integrity, because the security of financial, legal and other transactions performed digitally by representatives of the organization will depend on its successful execution.</p><p>GLEIF itself does not perform any vetting of the legal entity or its representatives and is not involved in the vLEI issuance process, but through the EGF they develop and manage the detailed rules for how it all gets done, and ensure their QVIs are following those rules. It is GLEIF’s QVIs — who’ve been extensively vetted themselves by GLEIF and must remain qualified annually — who vet representatives and issue vLEI credentials. GLEIF is the global guardian and compliance officer of these governance frameworks.</p> OCs, Privacy, and Self-Sovereignty  Personal Privacy and Graduated Disclosure <p>With OCs the personal privacy of the holder — a representative of the organization — is of less relevance when that representative is an employee or contractor and they are acting within that context; the organization gets to decide what that representative should be disclosing or keeping private, which they can do quite powerfully with Graduated Disclosure as described below. When an OC holder is a customer or constituent, however, personal privacy becomes critically and legally important, magnifying the need for robust disclosure capabilities.</p><p>As with all ACDC VCs, OCs have three granular, legally enforceable “Graduated Disclosure” capabilities highly relevant to and needed by organizations:</p><p>Selective disclosure — the ability to provably disclose only some information without disclosing the rest, such as one’s authority but not their name, or their name but not their authority, or only one aspect of their authority such as their financial ceiling for signing purchase&nbsp;orders.</p><p>Contractually protected disclosure — when counterparties verifiably consent to the terms of disclosure prior to disclosure. The provided consent is non-repudiable, providing a path for recourse if the terms of disclosure are not&nbsp;honored.</p><p>Contingent disclosure — disclosure is possible only when certain conditions are met, such as keeping an identity encrypted and in a form of escrow for business purposes and interactions, but enabling that identity to be discoverable by law enforcement or regulators if it becomes necessary. Contingent disclosure solves tricky problems in telecommunications, for example, when the originator of a communication may not wish to be identifiable to network operators, but must become identifiable to authorities if their traffic turns out to be fraudulent or&nbsp;spam.</p> Self-Sovereignty <p>When employees or contractors are acting in representation of an organization, the org is sovereign and not the individual; there is no self-sovereignty in this situation. There is autonomy of course, as the person can choose to behave however they please regardless of rules or expectations, but not self-sovereignty. Like privacy, however, the principle changes when the representative is a customer or constituent; then the sovereignty of the OC’s holder becomes relevant. Still, the customer’s or constituent’s OC was issued by the organization and can be revoked at the organization’s discretion.</p> An OC’s Superpower: Traversing Boundaries <p>Arguably the greatest capability of OCs — and all VCs that have a sufficiently strong root of trust — is the ability to traverse boundaries of all kinds. Boundaries are the killers of identity systems, seamless interactions, and digital trust generally. OCs are ground-breaking precisely because they are boundary-breaking.</p><p>Some example digital boundaries useful to traverse:</p>  Geographical/political borders (between countries)  Organizational boundaries (between companies/organizations)  Network/software boundaries (between software and hardware networks)  Hierarchical boundaries (any level of depth within an organization)  Heterarchical boundaries (every boundary between systems that isn’t hierarchical)  Communication channels (email, messaging apps, social media, calls, texts,&nbsp;etc.)  Cyberspace-to-physical space* (physical-to-digital)  <p>In each of these cases, OCs issued within one domain can be verified as authentic in another. Choosing to accept a verified OC becomes a matter of policy, not technology. For example, many countries have a national digital ID scheme, e.g. eIDAS in Europe, BankID in the Nordics, Compass and Singpass in Singapore. These schemes are incompatible with each other; in order to accept identity credentials in a cross-border fashion, participating countries must have a bespoke bilateral agreement and build bespoke technical infrastructure for each one they choose to accept, so it doesn’t happen often, with organizations ultimately suffering the&nbsp;most.</p><p>Such is the advantage of OCs using free and open standardized underlying protocols instead of shared platforms, even when implemented on a national scale: no bespoke agreements or technical infrastructure is required, just adoption of the same underlying standard key management, issuance, and verification protocols.</p> In Conclusion <p>As we said at the beginning, OCs enable representatives of an organization to prove their authority to represent the organization outside its boundaries to anyone, anywhere, without using identity providers, blockchains, shared platforms or other intermediaries. Never before has verifiable authority been possible across all boundaries and at global scale, and the underlying protocols that enable it are open and free to use, inviting anyone and everyone to commence as they please. A great many things are about to change, in a very positive&nbsp;way.</p><p>In this Part 2 we discussed the what and the why of OCs and verifiable authority, but not the how; we didn’t get technical, leaving readers to reasonably wonder exactly how all this is even possible. In Part 3 we’ll get technical by inviting the inventor of KERI key management and ACDC verifiable credentials, Dr. Samuel Smith, to explain in as business-friendly terms as he can, how OCs accomplish the things we’ve claimed in Part&nbsp;2.</p><p>Stay tuned.</p><p>¹ See <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/crypto-isnt-decentralized-nft-bored-ape-yacht-club-buys-cryptopunks-2022-3">Crypto isn’t decentralized</a>, <a href="https://engineeringideas.substack.com/p/blockchain-is-not-decentralised">Blockchain is not decentralized</a>, and <a href="https://qz.com/2112965/web3-is-not-decentralized">Web3 is not decentralized</a></p>

most likely reason why Meta is implementing
ActivityPub in its upcoming Twitter competitor “P92”, and that ActivityPub

  <p>In previous posts, I argued the EU’s Digital Services and Digital Markets Acts are the
<a href="https://reb00ted.org/tech/20230625-meta-why-activitypub/">most likely reason</a> why Meta is implementing
ActivityPub in its upcoming Twitter competitor “P92”, and that ActivityPub
is really <a href="https://reb00ted.org/tech/20230627-meta-activitypub-eu-digital-services-act/">the only game in town</a>
that meets Meta’s requirements for interop for “P92”, as they require protocols that
are proven to work and governed in a lawyer-vetted process by a legitimate standards
organization.</p>
<p>But if that line of reasoning is correct for for why Meta would pick ActivityPub to
meet its interoperability obligations under EU’s new rules, it is likely also
correct for all other social networking products, by Meta and others, that are required
to interop by the same new rules, notably:</p>
 
 Facebook (also Meta) 
 Instagram (also Meta) 
 Snapchat (Snap) 
 LinkedIn (Microsoft) 
 Twitter 
 and perhaps even YouTube (Google). 
 
<p>(The full list is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Services_Act#Very_large_online_platforms">here</a>
although I think the EU puts them in different markets. Update 2023-06-30: Actually, this
is the wrong list; the list of “gatekeepers” will only be established in a couple of months
under the Digital Markets Act. Chances are it’s very similar to this list of “Very large
on-line platforms”, however.)</p>
<p>Let me say this again. The product teams of all of those products are very likely
asking themselves the very same question right now that Meta asked itself: what are
we going to implement to meet our interop obligations, and when are we going to do it?</p>
<p>I believe most will arrive at the same conclusion: they will look for protocols
that can demonstrably work for these kinds of interop requirements, and that are
maintained by a well-understood standards organization. And will find that
ActivityPub is the only game in town that meets those requirements.</p>
<p>(It is possible that one or two of the organizations above come up with a “spoiler”
strategy developing or picking an alternate protocol. To make up a random example, say,
Microsoft might buy Bluesky and declare it to be its interop architecture. They would have
to turn that protocol over to a standards org, however, before its competitors would
even consider it. And that might not gain them much; sticking with ActivityPub is
simpler.)</p>
<p>(It is also possible that some of the above organization will choose to fight the EU in
court; Twitter comes to mind. I’m not a lawyer, I don’t know how likely this might
succeed; however, the EU has shown to be tenacious and unstoppably moving forward in
this direction, so I wouldn’t bet on that strategy if I were them.)</p>
<p>Which means a number of things – starting with the ActivityPub standardization process
in the W3C:</p>
 
 
<p>Meta, Microsoft and others will suddenly show up in the W3C ActivityPub community. It’s
easy for them to do, they already have been spending significant amounts of time
in the W3C.</p>
 
 
<p>They will show up with requirements currently considered out of scope by the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/cg/socialcg/">W3C SWICG</a>, but driven by the need that the
entire stack is standardized that is necessary to enable interop between, say LinkedIn
and Facebook. If they decide that real interop is actually necessary – my premise –
then an “assembly required” standard (like ActivityPub is today) is not sufficient for
them.</p>
 
 
<p>Therefore the official <a href="https://www.w3.org/Social/WG">Social Web Working Group</a> will
need to be re-constituted, and its charter will need to be broader than it was before.</p>
 
 
<p>There will be loud screaming in the existing W3C social community. (Because many of the
members of the current SWIGC are extremely strongly in opposed to surveillance capitalism
– the prevailing business model of most of the companies above – or, in some cases,
that any kind of business has any role in desirable forms of social media at all.)
An accommodation will have to be found, as the W3C as an organization wants to
serve all willing participants in a standards process, not just those with a
certain value system.</p>
 
 
<p>But there more intriguing, and exciting possibility is this:</p>
 
 When everything is said and done and my line of reasoning is reasonably correct,
interoperability via ActivityPub indeed might be “everywhere”: Facebook, Instagram,
P92, LinkedIn, Snapchat, even Twitter. 
 
<p>Social media would end up being a radically different beast. A potentially much better,
beast as I believe. Ponder this.</p>
<p>Updated 2023-06-30:</p>
 
 Added Digital Markets Act in addition to the Digital Services Act; it’s really both
and the intent behind them that drive this.

   Imagine you are Meta executive management, and one day your lawyers come to you and say: 
 
 “We assess it as very likely that within a year or two, Meta’s social networking products
will need to interoperate with social networks from other vendors, such as Twitter,
LinkedIn, Snapchat and the like. Europe’s Digital Services and Market Acts have come in effect,

  <p>Imagine you are Meta executive management, and one day your lawyers come to you and say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We assess it as very likely that within a year or two, Meta’s social networking products
will need to interoperate with social networks from other vendors, such as Twitter,
LinkedIn, Snapchat and the like. Europe’s Digital Services and Market Acts have come in effect,
they apply to us, and while we think we can delay enforcement for a while, ultimately we will
need to interoperate with other social networks if we don’t want to leave the entire
European market or get sued out of existence. These Europeans are not kidding.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You might argue with them for a bit, but if they insist that their assessment is correct,
and there are no viable legal options to avoid doing this, if you were the Meta executive
team, what would you do?</p>
<p>I think there are two key questions:</p>
 
 What exactly are you going to implement? 
 When are you going to implement it in which product? 
 
<p>Let’s start with the second question. Whatever you end up doing, it’s novel: nobody
has ever federated social networking products at the billion+ user population level.
And so nobody has any experience what kinds of problems might occur – whether technical,
moderation-wise, protocol governance, fixing interop problems by collaborating with
your competitors, cross-jurisdiction issues if content seeps from another social network
that’s banned there etc etc. Nobody even knows what the list of potential problems even
could be. So even if you are not trying to drag your feet, you will want to
start small, and gain some experience how to do this, before scaling up to billions
of users. I think even the most zealous regulator will probably accept that a gradual
approach is warranted.</p>
<p>But: your existing social networking products, notably Facebook and Instagram, have
billions of users. It’s not obvious how you can start small and not confuse the heck
out of everybody. Works only in the EU? What if people travel or move? And the EU
with its almost half a billion people is too large anyway as an initial user population.</p>
<p>As luck has it, you also just decided you were going to compete with Twitter. With
a completely new product which currently has a user population of … zero! And given
you haven’t really built it yet, you can architect it from the get-go to be
interop friendly. Much easier than to refactor Instagram at the billion user scale.
So why not start there?</p>
<p>Back to the other question: what exactly are you going to implement? Let’s assume the
lawyers have also advised to you that mere lip service is not going to be good enough,
the interop actually needs to work, work well, and be a reliable, supported feature,
for many years to come.</p>
<p>It also needs to work not just with one competitor, like, say, Twitter, but at least
a half dozen of them, and new ones show up from time to time you will need to interop with,
too. So bilateral deals won’t work, and it needs to be based on an industry standard;
either one that exists already or that is to be created. And that industry standard
needs to be maintained by some standards organization that you understand, that does not
give any one vendor outside influence, one whose process you have vetted and perhaps
have experience with.</p>
<p>Enter ActivityPub. It seems to work, at least at the million-user level. And it’s
the only social networking interop standard around that has been created by a bona-fide
standards organizations, the W3C. None of the other protocols – like Bluesky, Nostr
etc – meet those requirements; ActivityPub is really the only (existing) game in town
for what you need.</p>
<p>Ergo: you end up with ActivityPub in your upcoming Twitter competitor, pretty much from
the very beginning. Which is the most plausible reason I found
<a>in a previous post</a> why Meta might do this
completely out-of-character thing and implement ActivityPub in its new “P92” product.</p>
<p>Updated 2023-06-30:</p>
 
 Added Digital Markets Act in addition to the Digital Services Act; it’s really both. 
 Feedback from the Fediverse correctly points out that so far, only interop requirements
for messaging services (“Whatsapp” etc) are prescribed in detail (in the Digital Markets
Act). However, IMHO that misses the larger picture: I read the aim of the text of the
acts as applying to all “commonly used digital services  that mostly directly intermediate
between business users and end users” and “where concerns about weak contestability and
unfair practices by gatekeepers are more apparent and pressing from an internal market
perspective” which arguably applies more to social networking than messaging services.
Also, Twitter-like services are very much also used as direct messaging services
as well.

  <p>Meta has gradually <a href="https://snarfed.org/2018-08-03_rip-facebook-for-bridgy">locked down</a>
all of its apps. Now they are coming out with a
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/8/23754304/instagram-meta-twitter-competitor-threads-activitypub">Twitter competitor</a>
that, according to all reports, will have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub">ActivityPub</a>
standards support. This promises to make it interoperable with other social networking apps
like Mastodon in the broader <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse">Fediverse</a> decentralized
social network.</p>
<p>The Fediverse is in uproar, debating fiercely how to react to it, with a
<a href="https://fedipact.online/">sizable group</a> of operators already promising to block
them out of the gate, mostly on the grounds that Meta is the personification of everything
that the Fediverse is against: tracking, surveillance, manipulation, advertising.</p>
<p>But why would Meta support ActivityPub in the first place? It is
completely out of character for them. I would suggest that only if we understand
Meta’s goals with ActivityPub support can we make a rational assessment what, if
anything, we should do to react.</p>
<p>First, let’s dispense with this first commonly cited reason why they do this. It does
not pass muster.</p>
<p>1. Meta wishes to leverage today’s Fediverse to get started, and then embrace and
extinguish it.</p>
<p>No, it does not. Two good arguments:</p>
 
 
<p>Numbers: Alex Heath is <a href="https://mastodon.social/@alexeheath/110596226686316769">reporting</a>
that “Meta is hoping for at least tens of millions of users within the first few
months of availability”. The Fediverse currently has between 1 and 2 million active monthly
users. So Meta is expecting at least 10x of those numbers by the end of the year.</p>
<p>(If you think of it, of course they want those kinds of numbers. Both Facebook and
Instagram have far more than a billion users each. Why would they build another app if
they didn’t think they would get at least 100 million users?)</p>
<p>Embrace and extend is an entirely ineffective strategy if what you want to embrace and
extend has only a tenth of the users you want “in just a few months”. It is not worth
to embark on such a complex strategy if it only works for a month or two at best.</p>
 
 
<p>Would you really go to market focused on an initial customer segment that contains all
the people – and perhaps only those people – most actively hostile to you as a company?</p>
 
 
<p>Verdict: NO.</p>
<p>Let’s move on to a more likely reason:</p>
<p>2. Meta observed that Elon cut off many third-party apps from Twitter, and wants to
attract those third-party developers to the new app so the new app can more effectively
compete with Twitter.</p>
<p>This is a more compelling reason. Building an ecosystem of complementary apps and
services is a tried-and-true, successful strategy to compete against a product that
does not have them. And which just burned its bridges with the developer community
by cutting them off out of the blue.</p>
<p>However: if that was goal, why would they implement standardized ActivityPub, as opposed
to simply creating a (proprietary) API, like Meta has for its other products? It’s not
like the cut-off Twitter app developers will require a standard API to come to Meta:
not losing their business is good enough for them. Also, implementing a standard
protocol comes with substantial costs and risks to Meta, including its inability to
change it on a whim when Meta’s business circumstances should change.</p>
<p>Verdict: INSUFFICIENT as an explanation.</p>
<p>3. The European Union is coming down hard on Meta, demanding all sorts of interoperability
as part of its Digital Services and Digital Market Acts. By implementing a bona-fide W3C
interoperability standard as part of a new app, Meta can signal both cooperation with the
EU authorities, while delaying opening its core business as long as possible.</p>
<p>In the US, we tend to ignore changes in European law. We also seem to consider it
inconceivable that any meaningful jurisdiction would actually pass the kinds of laws
that they have been passing left and right. But they have, and the EU commission is not
kidding with enforcement either. While Meta may decide to
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/22/23770620/meta-news-facebook-instagram-canada-online-news-act">leave Canada</a>
to not have to comply with certain Canadian laws, they cannot afford to leave an affluent,
almost <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_single_market">half-billion people</a> market.</p>
<p>I’m sure Meta is embarking on a multi-pronged strategy to resist, including lobbying,
lawsuits, dragging their feet, and all sorts of other things. This multi-pronged strategy
probably also means they have to throw the regulators a bone, on occasion. What better than to
do this with a new product where there is no downside to an existing business, because
there is no existing business? And if that helps with improving brand image – which it
does – and appeal to 3rd-party developers, which the incumbent just turned against
themselves, why not?</p>
<p>Verdict: MOST PLAUSIBLE.</p>
<p>If this analysis is more or less correct, this has consequences both for what Meta will
doing going forward, and what today’s Fediverse should do to prepare and react.

<p>Once upon a time, there was a powerful landlord who owned much of the land. He had
lots of serfs working on that land. While the landlord was an absolute monarch and
profited from the work of the serfs more than he otherwise would have,  both landlord
and tenants were mostly happy with the arrangement.</p>
 
Reddit had lots of users, merrily posting links and having discussions. Reddit would
monetize this through ads.
 
<p>Then one day, the landlord decided to raise taxes. He didn’t talk to his serfs
first. He, just one day, out of the blue, announced that there would be taxes, and
specifically taxes on the tools that the serfs were using to make themselves more
productive.</p>
 
Reddit suddenly announced high charges for their API, making many external tools
financially non-viable.
 
<p>Not only were the unexpected taxes high, they were so high that it made it effectively
impossible for the serfs to continue using those tools, thereby reducing productivity
and happiness of the serfs.</p>
 
This made it effectively impossible for Reddit moderators to use external moderation tools
and users could no longer use 3rd-party clients.
 
<p>Guess what happened next?</p>
<p>Surprising absolutely nobody, the serfs – well, some of them – revolted. Some stopped
farming their fields. Some closed their markets and stores. Some planted signs all
over the land with directions to other lands not controlled by this landlord, suggesting
that everybody pack up and leave the lord’s land. Some ingenious serfs even started
mislabeling their produce, calling it “not safe”, thereby striking directly at the
revenue stream of the landlord.</p>
 
Some Reddit moderators took their subreddits private. Some directed their users over
into the Fediverse to <a href="https://join-lemmy.org/">Lemmy</a> and
<a href="https://kbin.pub/en">/kbin</a>. And some other labeled their subreddits
"not safe for work", striking directly at Reddit's advertising revenue
as fewer advertisers want to be seen in that context.
 
<p>So the landlord struck back. He fired foremen and village elders, inviting less scrupulous
others to take over their place. He forced stores to open again, and sent his goons to remove the “not safe” stickers.</p>
 
Reporedly some moderators were forcibly removed by Reddit, subreddits re-opened and
NSFW labels forcibly removed.
 
<p>I’m writing this in political terms, because the analogy is just so incredibly striking.</p>
<p>By that analogy, we all know history and what might come next. As in history, the
short-term outcome is uncertain. The longer-term trends, however, are clear.</p>

<p>
Last week I had to convert a table in a Google Doc to a JSON structure that will render as an HTML page. This is the sort of mundane task that burns staggering amounts of information workers’ time, effort, and attention. Until recently there were two ways to do it. For most, it’s a mind-numbing manual exercise. For some (like me) it can sometimes be possible to write a script to do the transformation, but that’s another mind-numbing exercise, and it’s always tough to decide in advance whether the time and effort saved will be worth the trouble.</p>
<p>
Tabular data is famously complex. Recently, I wrote a Steampipe plugin to find tables in web pages and transform them into Postgres tables. Then, naively, I tried to do the same for PDF files. It had been a while since I used any of the available libraries for parsing PDFs. Last time it hadn’t gone well,  I thought maybe things had improved since, but no, it remains an unsolved problem. Which is tragic for many reasons, not least that the corpus of scientific knowledge lives in PDF files, and the tabular info they contain remains unavailable to machine processing. That’s not just my opinion. I consulted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Murray-Rust">Peter Murray-Rust</a>, who has spent decades working on this problem, and he confirmed that as yet there’s no general solution.</p>
 An eye-opening outcome 
<p>
So you can imagine my surprise and delight when ChatGPT-4 accomplished the task. As usual, I first tried the Simplest Thing That Could Possibly Work. Rather than exporting the GDoc to one of the available formats, I just copied from the screen, pasted into the chat, and asked for a Markdown table. What you get, when you paste a copied GDoc table, is completely unformatted: one item per line, with no indication of what’s a table header, or a section header, or a normal row. There’s no apparent structure at all. And yet the tool was able to find the structure in that undifferentiated stream of items, and faithfully recreate the table. </p>
<p>
I then presented an example of the JSON format, and asked for a transformation of the Markdown table to that format. It was a big table with a dozen sections, each with a handful of rows, and that didn’t go well. What I’m learning, though, is that the same strategy we use as programmers — decompose big tasks into smaller chunks — works well with LLMs. That’s why I opted for Markdown as an intermediate format, instead of asking to transform the raw data directly to the target JSON format. </p>
<p>
The next part was especially interesting. I asked for a list of the section names, which it reported correctly. Then I asked to translate each section, by name, to the target format. That worked. It still required a dozen manual steps, because I had to append each generated JSON chunk to the final output, but that took a fraction of the time and effort that would otherwise be required.</p>
<p>
We are on the cusp of a new era of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_Surplus">cognitive surplus</a>. People shouldn’t be laboriously transposing document formats, as millions (maybe billions) of information workers spend minutes (maybe hours) doing every day. These are tedious chores; it’s impossible to overstate how taxing they are, or what a relief it is to outsource them to the machine. That said…</p>
 A few caveats 
<p>Beginner’s luck?: I was unable to reproduce the behavior exactly as described here. This seems typical so far with LLMs, and I sometimes wonder if some of the best outcomes are just beginner’s luck. But actually, I think it may have more to do with interaction boundaries. In ChatGPT (and friends), New Chat (or equivalent) doesn’t seem to reset in a way that enables me to reproduce a result. Maybe there is no way? </p>
<p>Context window: I tried prompting with docx and html exports of the GDoc, but they were too large. My guess is that more context headroom wouldn’t necessarily have enabled me to do the whole job in one go, versus multiple interactions, because the path from bigger prompt to a desired transformation becomes less likely to be followed. Again, who knows? We’re in a realm of experimention that’s full of such unknowns.</p>
<p>Verification: My first rule for effective use of an LLM to perform some well-defined task has been: It’s quick and easy to verify the result. Right away, simple bash and Python scripts met that criterion. A script that combines a bunch of isomorphic CSV files into one big file, while deduplicating the headers, either works or it doesn’t. That’s easy to verify. And it’s quick, too, even if you wind up iterating a few times. The table transformation described here falls into the same category. It did require a proofread, and I made a couple of tiny tweaks, but verification was quick and easy. Had it been 10x larger, though, the burden of verification would suck some of the value out of the LLM solution.</p>
<p>Other LLMs: None of the others did well on this task. I expect they’ll all improve, though, and as they do, it’ll become more and more feasible to ask for multiple results in parallel, and look for consensus among them.</p>
 PDF tables in the scientific record 
<p>
It’s my understanding that <a href="https://commoncrawl.org/">arxiv.org</a> is in the <a href="https://commoncrawl.org/">CommonCrawl</a>, so the LLMs are seeing zillions of tables in scientific papers. Tables are used there for layout, for data, or for a mixture of both purposes. Nowadays, when a conversation turns to the brokenness of scholarly publishing, and the perpetual dominance of data-unfriendly PDF formats, my eyes start to bleed. Semantic markup, smoothly implemented from inception to collaborative editing to HTML publication, was always the dream. Maybe it’ll never happen that way; instead, we’ll just use anything to write and edit, we’ll publish to PDF (but please not two-column!), and then we’ll extract document structure at the end of the toolchain. I never thought that might be possible, I’m not sure it’s a right answer, but this is a good time to be open to unconventional possibiliites. Whatever unlocks the data in the world’s corpus of scholarly PDFs is worth doing. </p>

Verified Permissions has been in gated preview since November, but now it's available to everyone.</p><p>My team worked on an integration between Verified Permissions and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/">Amazon Cognito</a>, Amazon's OpenID Connect service. The idea is pretty simple: if you're using Cognito to manage the people who use your application, then you will likely want to use the information that is stored in Cognito for your access control policies.</p><p>Our bit of code allows developers to just submit the tokens they get back from Cognito as a result of the authentication process to Verified Permissions. Verified Permissions uses the attributes they contain to perform a policy evaluation. I wrote a blog post for the AWS Security blog about how this works called <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/simplify-fine-grained-authorization-with-amazon-verified-permissions-and-amazon-cognito/">Simplify fine-grained authorization with Amazon Verified Permissions and Amazon Cognito</a>. I'll describe the basic idea here, but the blog post has details and links.</p><p>Suppose, you've got a policy that allows anyone to view any resource so long as their location is <code>USA</code>:</p> <code>permit(  
  principal,  
  action == Action::"view",  
  resource  
)
when {principal.location == "USA"};  
</code> <p>If <code>Alice</code> wants to view <code>VacationPhoto94.jpg</code>, then your call to Verified Permissions might look like this if you're not using the Cognito Token:</p> <code>//JS pseudocode  
const authResult = await avp.isAuthorized({  
    principal: 'User::"alice"',  
    action: 'Action::"view"',  
    resource: 'Photo::"VacationPhoto94.jpg"',  
    // whenever our policy references attributes of the entity, isAuthorized  
    // needs an entity argument that provides those attributes  
    entities: [  
        {
            "identifier": {  
                "entityType": "User",  
                "entityId": "alice"  
            },  
            "attributes": {  
                "location": {  
                    "String": "USA"  
                }
            }  
        ]
});  
</code> <p>You have to supply information about the principal and any relevant attributes so the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2023/04/minimal_vs_fully_qualified_access_requests.shtml">policy has the context it needs to evaluate correctly</a>. Now, suppose your Cognito token contains location information as an attribute:</p> <code>{
 ...  
 “iss”: “User”,  
 “sub”: “alice”,  
 “custom:location”: “USA”,  
 ...  
}
</code> <p>Assuming the token is stored in a variable named <code>cognito_id_token</code> you can make a call like this:</p> <code>const authResult = await avp.isAuthorizedWithToken({  
    identity_token: cognito_id_token  
    action: 'Action::"view"',  
    resource: 'Photo::"VacationPhoto94.jpg"'  
});  
</code> <p>Using <code>isAuthorizedWithToken</code>, you don’t have to supply the principal or construct the entities argument. Pretty slick.</p><p>Take a look at the blog post I mentioned earlier if you're interested in using this in your application. There's more information about the configuration process and how to add resource attributes to the call. This was a fun project.</p>   <p>Photo Credit: <a href="https://pixabay.com/photos/jigsaw-puzzle-puzzle-picture-pieces-712465/">Puzzle Pieces</a> from Erdenebayar (Pixabay Content License)</p>

<p>
Buoyed by the success of my <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2023/05/24/when-the-rubber-duck-talks-back/">LLM-assisted refactoring exercise</a>, I set a new and (for me) more ambitious goal. While the refactoring task was a bit challenging, I didn’t have to learn new concepts and syntax. The basic patterns and Go idioms for Steampipe plugins were already familiar, I just had to find the right way to rearrange things. </p>
<p>
Now, though, I wanted to tackle another project that I’d been blocked on: a slider widget for Steampipe <a href="https://steampipe.io/docs/dashboard/overview">dashboards</a>. Why? Well, there are million uses for an input control that reports continuously varying values. For example, the Mastodon dashboard currently limits results by means of a picklist with hardcoded values.</p>
 input "limit" {
  title = "Max results"
  type = "select"  
  sql = &lt;&lt;EOQ
    with limits(label) as (
      values
        ( '20' ),
        ( '40' ),
        ( '100' ),
        ( '200' ),
        ( '500' )
    )
    select
      label,
      label::int as value
    from
      limits
  EOQ
}
 
<p>
It would be nice, instead, to code a widget like this…</p>
 input "limit" {
  title = "Max results"
  type = "slider"
  sql = &lt;&lt;EOQ
    select
      20 as min,
      500 as max,
      40 as step,
      80 as default
  EOQ
}
 
<p>
…that renders something like this:</p>
<p>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/steampipe/minimal-slider-display.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>
Why was this an ambitious goal? In this case there were a whole bunch of new concepts and idioms to absorb. A Steampipe <a href="https://steampipe.io/docs/reference/mod-resources/overview">dashboard resource</a> touches many different aspects of the Steampipe system. The main components are: Steampipe itself, the base program that launches both Postgres and the dashboard server; the dashboard server that forwards queries to Steampipe and receives query results; and the dashboard app that defines widgets instantiated with query results. Multiple communication channels are in play, including a websocket connection from the dashboard server to the dashboard app, and event-driven message flow within the app. </p>
<p>
For aspiring plugin developers, there’s an SDK and documentation about common idioms and patterns. No such tooling or guidance is yet available to the widget developer. Parts of the dashboard system are written in Go code, parts in React-flavored TypeScript. I’d used TypeScript before, but had never touched React, so I not only needed to learn some key React concepts, I also had to grok how they look and feel in TypeScript. </p>
<p>
We’ve seen plenty of examples of LLMs writing Fibonacci generators, then writing tests for them, then translating from Python to JavaScript. Far more typical, I think, are tasks that require diving into an unfamiliar code base and learning just enough to make useful progress on some tactical goal.</p>
 Can you fly that thing? 
<p></p>
<p>
Here’s my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoAk7zBTrvo">favorite scene</a> in the Matrix.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Neo: Can you fly that thing?</p>
<p>

<p>
Trinity: Not yet. </p>
<p>

<p>
Tank: Operator.</p>
<p>
Trinity: I need a pilot progam for a B-212 helicopter. Hurry.</p>
<p>
(eyelids flutter briefly)</p>
<p>
Trinity: Let’s go.</p>
<p>
(they jump in the chopper and fly off the roof)
</p></blockquote>
<p>
That’s what I want, and what we all need, for coding (among many other things). Could LLM assistants help me rapidly learn what I needed to know to add a basic slider to Steampipe’s gallery of widgets? That was my experiment, and here’s my report.</p>
 An overly-optimistic first try 
<p>
I started by feeding examples of existing input widgets to ChatGPT-4 and Sourcegraph Cody, and asking how to modify the patterns for a new slider widet. Predictably that yielded confident but useless results. Although Sourcegraph has now indexed the <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe">Steampipe repo</a>, and is presumably making <a href="https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/cody-is-cheating#sourcegraph-platform-101">embeddings</a> available to Cody, it wasn’t clear to me whether, or to what extent, that made a difference. No big deal, I wasn’t really expecting this approach to work, but it never hurts to ask!</p>
<p>
Next I tried prompting with a José Reyes <a href="https://jreyesr.github.io/posts/steampipe-part-int-pi-mods/">blog post</a> that contains a detailed explanation of how he made a <a href="https://steampipe.io/blog/release-0-20-0#time-axis-charts">significant improvement</a> to the <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe/pull/3214">chart widget</a>. Would that material supply enough useful context? Not for ChatGPT-4 or Cody, evidently. If there’s a way to craft a prompt that uses José’s explanation to produce a working slider, I’d love to see it.</p>
<p>
If you haven’t seen José’s blog, by the way, I commend it to you. Over the past few months he’s shown an astonishing ability to jump into diverse code bases and do useful things with them. His <a href="https://jreyesr.github.io/tags/steampipe/">Steampipe series</a>, in six installments so far, covers a wide variety of Steampipe topics in great depth and provides a wealth of instructive examples. </p>
<p>
It’s humbling, to be honest. I’ve worked for a while now on the periphery of the Steampipe, building plugins and dashboards, but have barely scratched the surface as a contributor to the core. Although I’m wary of applying the 10x label to a developer, José clearly deserves it. Me, not so much, 1x at best. I’m a fountain of good ideas that I often struggle to implement quickly and well, especially in code bases that span unfamiliar languages, frameworks, and components. If LLM augmentation can get me even to 1.5x or 2x, never mind 10x, that’ll be a huge win for me — and for a whole lot of average developers like me.</p>
 A more realistic next try 
<p>
Programmers aim to decompose tasks into small, manageable chunks. The same discipline applies when working with LLM assistants. For starters, I lowered the goal post. I originally hoped to implement a two-handled slider, like the one I used in this <a href="https://jonudell.info/av/">AV editor</a>. But first I needed a basic understanding of how to wire up any kind of new dashboard widget, and for that I wanted the simplest possible slider. </p>
<p>
I asked both ChatGPT-4 and Cody, in various ways, for ideas. At one point, Cody proposed &lt;input type="range"&gt;. Oh? No kidding? I didn’t know that was a thing, thanks Cody! A native HTML element was just the right starter element. There would still be plenty to learn about Steampipe/React/TypeScript conventions for wiring such a thing into Steampipe’s dashboard system. No need to complicate matters with a library that implements a fancier slider but brings extra conceptual baggage.</p>
<p>
As a widget developer, you’re operating in an environment where the results of your widget’s query are magically available in a data property that you can unpack in the widget’s TypeScript code. How is that data made available to the widget? It’s complicated. I spent a good while spelunking to find out how exactly it’s done, I still can’t clearly articulate all the ingredients, or data flows that interconnect them, and I didn’t find a way for the LLMs to usefully aid the investigation. At one point I found myself in Chromium’s devtools, looking at websocket traffic and setting breakpoints to isolate event sources and handlers. I can envision LLMs enlisting debuggers, just as ChatGPT can now consult WolframAlpha via a plugin, but we’re not there yet. Manual debugging (where available!) will remain a critical skill for exploring unfamiliar code. </p>
<p>
Tracing that data flow wasn’t strictly necessary, though. For my purposes, it was OK to just accept that the data property magically holds the results of the query. Now I needed to work out how to use that data to initialize the widget, and then wire up a handler to set a new value when the slider’s handle moves. As a React/TypeScript newbie, though, even that was nontrivial. Last time I tried I got lost in the abstractions and came up empty-handed. This time, I hoped my pair of rubber ducks could help me break through.</p>
 Exploring examples 
<p>
I modeled the slider on another widget type, <a href="https://steampipe.io/docs/reference/mod-resources/input#example-usage">select</a>, which builds a picklist and reports the selected item. It wasn’t an ideal starting point because there’s a family of select widgets, interrelated in ways that require more complex coding than the slider would. Neither of the LLMs managed to distill the essence of a slider from those examples, but in the back-and-forth dialog with them I began to put the pieces together.</p>
<p>
It was straightford to put a slider onto the canvas. Then it took me a while to work out how to wire it into the React machinery. At one point, as multiple useEffect hooks came into play, I found myself wondering about why their dependency arrays were sometimes empty. Both LLMs gave the same answer: an empty array means the effect only runs once after the initial render.</p>
<p>
I’m an example-driven learner, though, so I wanted to see which of the useEffect hooks in the code base work that way. ChatGPT-4 can’t see the whole repo, so it doesn’t know. Cody, in VSCode, does see the repo, and is further enlightened by the embeddings in Sourcegraph’s indexed copy of the repo. Cody found some of the examples, but not all. Then it occurred to me to try Sourcegraph’s <a href="https://docs.sourcegraph.com/code_search/reference/structural">structural search</a>. Here’s the query that found all the examples.</p>
 context:global repo:^github\.com/turbot/steampipe$ useEffect(..., []) 
 
<p>
It’s interesting to see that, while Cody is joined at the hip to the Sourcegraph web app — and indeed even runs in a sidebar there, as well as in VSCode — it doesn’t yet seem to tap into structural search. Perhaps that will become the first external tool that plugs into Cody?</p>
 Controlled vs uncontrolled components 
<p>
At one point, as I worked out how to persist the slider’s selected value, I encountered what I now realize is a common React error.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Warning: A component is changing a controlled input to be uncontrolled.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Me: Huh?  </p>
<p>
Cody: This warning is occurring because you are setting a value prop on the element, but also listening for onChange events. This is conflicting – either the input should be controlled (by setting the value prop) or uncontrolled (by listening for onChange events). To fix this, you have a few options:</p>
 
 
Make the input controlled by setting value and handling changes with an onChange handler that calls setValue().<p></p>
  
Make the input uncontrolled by removing the value prop and keeping the onChange handler.<p></p>
  
Use a ref to access the DOM input and read its value when needed: const inputRef = useRef&lt;HTMLInputElement&gt;(null);
  
<p>
Eventually I worked out how to do it both ways. Then I asked ChatGPT-4 and Cody to compare them, evaluate tradeoffs, and weigh in on which approach to take. One favored uncontrolled’s simplicity, the other liked controlled’s flexiblity. Ultimately that’s for the maintainer to decide, if this turns into a pull request. For now I’m sticking with controlled, with a better sense of why than I could otherwise have easily gained.</p>
 A catalog of concepts 
<p>
Beyond the controlled/uncontrolled distinction, here (courtesy of ChatGPT-4) are some of the concepts and idioms that this exercise introduced me to:</p>
 
 
        Functional Component: <code>SliderInput</code> is defined as a functional component. In TypeScript, the props that this component accepts are explicitly typed as <code>InputProps</code>.
     
 
        Props and TypeScript Interfaces: In TypeScript, interfaces are used to ensure the props have the correct type. The <code>data</code> and <code>name</code> props are passed to the <code>SliderInput</code> component, and their types are defined by the <code>InputProps</code> interface.
     
 
        Destructuring Props: The props are destructured in the function parameter, allowing the properties to be accessed directly as variables (<code>data</code> and <code>name</code>) instead of as properties on a props object.
     
 
        useState Hook with TypeScript: The <code>useState</code> hook is used to add state to functional components. In TypeScript, you can provide a type argument to this hook to specify the type of the state variable. In this case, <code>value</code> is defined as a state variable with the type <code>number</code>.
     
 
        useEffect Hook: The <code>useEffect</code> hook lets you perform side effects in function components. In this case, it’s used for two purposes: <p></p>
 
 To update the <code>value</code> state when the <code>stateValue</code> prop changes. 
 To dispatch an action to set the initial value of the slider when the <code>defaultValue</code> changes.  
 
 
 
        Custom Hooks with TypeScript: Custom hooks are a mechanism to reuse stateful logic between components. The <code>useDashboard</code> hook is used to access the <code>dispatch</code> function and <code>selectedDashboardInputs</code> state from a dashboard context. These returned values also have their own types defined.
     
 
        Event Handling with TypeScript: Event handlers are used to handle user interactions with the component. In this case, the <code>sliderChange</code> function is triggered when the slider value changes. The type of the event object <code>e</code> is inferred from the context, but it could also be explicitly defined with <code>React.ChangeEvent&lt;HTMLInputElement&gt;</code> for stricter type checking.
     
 
        JSX and TypeScript (TSX): JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that is used to describe what the UI should look like. When using TypeScript, this syntax is referred to as TSX. TypeScript provides additional type safety in TSX code.
  
<p>
The output of this exercise was a few dozen lines of code involving all that conceptual stuff. But the result of the exercise feels bigger. As a developer of Steampipe dashboards, there are a few other affordances I’d like to have. Yes, it’s open source, so I can contribute, but I’m hard-pressed to justify climbing that learning curve. The LLM assistants ease that curve; I’m a better learner with them than without them; more feels possible than before. Doug Engelbart dreamed of <a href="https://www.dougengelbart.org/pubs/augment-3906.html">augmenting human intellect</a>. I wish he’d lived to see this moment. </p>

<blockquote><p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>
That’s how I met <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Iacobucci">Ed Iacobucci</a>. He left Citrix in 2000 to found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DayJet">DayJet</a>, a company that aimed to make real the vision of point-to-point air travel that James Fallows had championed in his book <a href="https://worldcat.org/title/881470297?oclcNum=881470297">Free Flight</a>.</p>
<p>
In 2007 I <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130729204438id_/http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail3278.html">interviewed Ed</a> for IT Conversations. It was one of the most memorable of the podcasts I made for that series.</p>
<p>
Ed died in 2013.</p>
<p>
The other day, Alan Levine <a href="https://cogdogblog.com/2023/05/changing-up-decripting-my-podcast-methods-eh-ai-eh/">pointed me</a> to <a href="https://descript.com">Descript</a>, a new tool for making podcasts with transcripts; it features a technique, first shown to me by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gridinoc">Laurian Gridinoc</a>, that uses <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2022/09/25/curating-the-studs-terkel-archive/">timecoded text as the interface for audio editing</a>. </p>
<p>
I’ve been waiting for that technique to appear in a mainstream podcast production app, so when I heard Descript was doing this I jumped right into a remake of the Ed Iacobucci podcast. It was a remarkable experience in many ways.</p>
<p>
There was no automatic transcription back then, so while I did a few experiments with Mechanical Turk, there were no transcripts of my shows. I uploaded the show’s MP3 file to Descript and it did a fantastic job of speech-to-text, faster and better than anything else I’ve tried. But that was just the start.</p>
<p>
I’m listed as the post-production engineer on that original podcast, which meant I edited the audio for clarity: eliding phrases or sentences, removing ums and likes. Doing that in a waveform editor was laborious to say the least. With Descript I was able to do much more of that kind of editing, better and faster, because text selection as the interface to audio editing is the absolute holy grail. </p>
<p>

There’s much more to say about Descript, which by the way deployed a significant upgrade in the middle of my project, but for now I’ll just say: Thank you! It’s a brilliant piece of software that enabled me to revisit one of my most treasured conversations and bring it to life in a way that people can now search for and read, as well as hear, with maximum fidelity. DayJet folded in 2008; it was a remarkable tale of innovation; here’s hoping Ed’s dream will come true.</p>

<p>Phil Windley: Up next on Interviews with Innovators, host Jon Udell talks with Ed Iacobucci, co-founder of Dayjet. Widely known in IT circles as the co-founder of Citrix, he left in 2000 to pursue his interest in aviation. In 2000 he co-founded DayJet, a company whose mission is to deliver on-demand jet travel services.</p>
<p>From IT Conversations. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: I have an ulterior and extremely selfish motivation for having this conversation. So you’ve been to Peterborough when you came to visit us at BYTE. You had to schlep to Manchester and then drive an hour, right?</p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: And getting to Manchester wasn’t even easy coming out of Florida.</p>
<p>Jon Udell: Now, what you probably didn’t know is that 20 miles west of Peterborough is the town I live in, which has a fabulous, and of course completely underutilized regional airport. We have in Keene an airport where we have, I think the third longest runway in the state.</p>
<p> It can land and does occasionally land Air Force One during political seasons. And back when you visited me, at BYTE in the, what was it like the late eighties, early nineties, we had commercial air service out of Keene that was subsidized by the essential air service program of the government. And so I was actually able to drive two minutes to my airport and I could be midtown Manhattan in an hour, quicker than anyone else could get there. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: But I bet it was hard to get to Huntsville, Alabama, though.</p>
<p>You can fix one degree of freedom, but not both. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: At some point I picked up on this emerging air taxi movement and I read the James Fallows book, and I just reread it the other day to prepare for this conversation and I’ve been basically just desperate for this to play out.</p>
<p>I’m just really curious to know, first of all, how you got into this and second of all how it’s going and, and third of all, most importantly for me, cause it’s all about me, you know, when can I be using my own airport again the way I’d like to? </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: (laughs) Well, that’s the objective.</p>
<p> I can’t tell you that we’re gonna achieve it all overnight. It’s one of those frontiers that’s never been properly addressed. You know, I spent most of my career, as you did yours, trying to elevate the computational and communication capabilities that businesses have through systems and networks and such. But one thing that we never really have addressed, on a broad scale, is the same interconnectivity from a physical standpoint. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: And of course architecturally it’s the exact same style, right? </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: It’s an awful lot of similarities.</p>
<p>Jon Udell: Yeah. It’s the peer-to-peer air travel network. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: That’s exactly what it is. I love talking to people that understand what I’m saying when I talk technology. It’s a different world that I’m involved in now, but basically, it is peer-to-peer versus hierarchical networks and all the same issues relating to efficiency and best routing in a dynamic environment.</p>
<p> That’s not the only issues, but those are some of the issues. That’s what attracted me to the project. I think if you remember when I left Citrix, one of the things that I wanted to do other than retire, which lasted about two months, that’s pretty boring actually. Retirement isn’t that’s cracked up to be. One of the things that I wanted to pursue, at least intellectually was where do we go with software as a service? Which remember we started exploring back in the late nineties. And Citrix, obviously that took on a life of its own.</p>
<p>And with ASPs and with a massively interconnected and computationally rich web, you know, one of the things that we’ve always done as technologists is focus on the evolution of infrastructure that people use for delivering things.</p>
<p>But there hasn’t been as much of a focus on vertically integrated, highly specialized systems, which, in many ways we always kind of poo-pooed. I mean, real technologists work on horizontal platforms, you know, kind of a macho attitude. In reality, that’s one step, but every pendulum swings.</p>
<p>And I think that the place where there’s a lot of value that can be added by a lot of smart people is, instead of building a highly horizontal platform that appeals to a lot of people, is go the other end of the spectrum and build a very highly specialized, vertical solution that solves one problem really well and leverage that platform not by making it available to a broad audience, cause almost by definition there isn’t one, but focus on the needs of a fully integrated service delivery. And that’s really what drove me to something that looks so different, like a service industry. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: The appeal of the air taxi idea though, is extremely broad. I mean, initially it’s not going to be something that most people, I guess, will be able to afford. But the idea can go extremely broad, right?</p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: Oh yeah. If we actually dive into the market itself, I like to joke with people, saying that Citrix was a lot of fun, but man, was it hard to explain to people why you’d wanna do remote computing when they didn’t think they needed it.</p>
<p>This on the other hand is the exact opposite. Everybody understands exactly what it is that we’re trying to achieve: seamless point to point travel on a cost efficient basis. And they grasp the concept very quickly, but very seldom do most people think deeply enough in terms of what the complexities are that are behind it, because, as a lot of appealing concepts are, it’s easy to come up with an idea, but it’s really hard to make it real.</p>
<p>A lot of people have had this idea for many, many years. In fact, that’s probably one tha t’s been kicked around for ages, but it’s not until recently — and by recently, I mean, I don’t know, 15 years, 20 years — that we’ve had the kind of tools that you need to really tackle the problem. Not solve it, but just tackle it. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: So let’s go through what the enablers are. Now the Fallows book lays out two broad categories of technological enabler. One is a new generation of general aviation craft, which are smarter, faster, lighter, and safer than what we’ve had, kind of unchanged really, for 30 or 40 years. </p>
<p>So that’s the airplane part of it. And he focuses a lot on that. In fact, a lot of the book is the story of, in particular, Cirrus. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: Sure.</p>
<p>Jon Udell: In parallel with that, and he talks less about it, but I’m hoping that we’ll talk a lot more about it, is this notion that you also have got now this thing called the internet. And one of the things that it can do is make demand visible and aggregate demand. </p>
<p>That if you could go to the internet and put a bid out that says, well, I’m here, and if there’s three or four other people within a 50 mile radius that wanna go to this other place, or various places within a 50 mile radius of some destination, then we can discover one another in a very dynamic way.</p>
<p>That was never conceivable until fairly recently. But I think that you’re talking about also operational routing capabilities. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: There’s a lot of complicating factors and, from a broad brush basis, I agree totally. It’s the hardware and the communications and software, obviously, that all come together. But I mean, at it’s very root, first of all, let’s talk about just general trends. What the real enabler in all this is really what we’ve been doing for 20 years.</p>
<p>It’s Moore’s law, it’s cheap memory and it’s good communications. I mean, that’s really what enables manufacturers to build airplanes better. That’s what essentially the glass cockpits are. I used to joke about it when we first started working on this is that it’s, you know, it’s a thin client.</p>
<p>It’s three pieces of glass up in the front and what used to be individual steam gauges all became applications that run an operating system. It’s highly redundant and, you know, multiple data buses and all sorts of enhancements to guarantee a certain level of reliability but at its core it’s an application running on an operating system. So the IT gains that we’ve made, or the technology gains, I should say, in the last 20 years, come very strongly to play in terms of how these new airplanes are designed.</p>
<p> Now having said that, let me back off for a second and say, I have a slightly different opinion that it’s not necessarily the airplane that’s revolutionary because this is something that I’ve learned in talking to a lot of manufacturers. There’s been a lot of hoopla about, you know, these VLJs (very light jets) are really what’s gonna change the world.</p>
<p> In reality, it isn’t really the airplane. Other than a few things like the integration of information systems, it’s still the same basic laws of physics that come to play. It’s still a wing, it’s two turbo fan engines, it’s one or two pilots. Structurally and aerodynamically it’s not a massive change from what existed before. The cost points are better. The manufacturing advantage that a modern manufacturer can do by intelligently engaging (with the) supply chain. Precision design and manufacturing are incremental improvements. But in the final analysis, a VLJ might give you 10, 20% better capability than a pre-existing design. </p>
<p> The other thing the VLJ lets you do is build volume because, as you’ll soon see, all these models are based on large, dense networks. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: You need a big fleet of taxis for this to make sense.</p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: You can’t do it with one or two, which is traditionally what people have done. And the problem traditionally is when people independently buy and then let out airplanes to the charter world is that they all wind up being personal things that are all different.</p>
<p>And if they’re all different, then you can’t optimize, you can’t do fleet maintenance programs, you can’t scale. So those are all barriers to scaling. So what you need is a large fleet of identical aircraft that are modern, that can be acquired in fleet quantities.</p>
<p>Part of what this revolution’s about, be it a VLJ or turbine or turboprop, I mean, the airplane technology isn’t as important as the fact that you can make them in large quantities. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: And you mean literally identical, or do you mean interoperable and interchangeable? </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: Literally identical. Well, it’s the same thing. From an operations standpoint, we abstract it a little bit and say, as long as they have the same operating characteristics, when you train on one, you can fly any of them. Whereas private aircraft on charter, every one of them is different because they have different instrument sets. </p>
<p>So on the aviation side, airplane design certainly benefited from technology, but it isn’t a revolution. It’s more of a rapid evolution, from a manufacturing standpoint. I think there’s a good shot that, you know, we can start seeing something that looks a little bit more like a revolution in that sense, that you can make a lot of them fast. Be that Honda, be that Eclipse, be that whoever, they’re all gonna wind up in the same place. </p>
<p>But the real revolution, I think, is often missed because it’s least understood. It’s in the business model. You and I have spent a lot of our lives in technology and we’ve seen the effect of creating or identifying new markets, new customers, new value propositions, and how things just spring up outta nowhere.</p>
<p>This is something that’s been part of our lives, our careers. But has not really played out very well , in many industries, one of which is aviation. The core business model of commercial aviation hasn’t changed at all. </p>
<p>They’re scheduled services. You can say they went to hubs and then Southwest did something a little bit less hubby, but it’s all about building a schedule and advertising and getting people to show up. Which is kind of like defining a big freight train that goes around on a schedule and and then you try to reach everybody possible.</p>
<p>And you have big wars in terms of who piles in and how many seats there are. And it’s a fixed market. I like to say, it’s the same one and a half million people that fly from Atlanta or Orlando every year. They fly on different airlines and they all fight each other over who gets the share.</p>
<p>But it’s not a growing market. It’s essentially the same zero sum game. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: And everyone’s going through the same hubs and those hubs are beyond capacity. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: And the charter world, nothing changes. The tax subsidies change from year to year, so it’s more attractive or less attractive for people of means to buy airplanes and then give them to somebody to manage them, to help offset costs.</p>
<p>But it isn’t a fundamental sea change in model. So what we tried to do was kind of abstract that, and I actually had a kind of a false start after I left Citrix. I feel very fortunate that I’ve been able to be in a position where I could actually buy my own airplane which to me, it isn’t so much the luxury of having an aircraft.</p>
<p>It’s really the luxury of being able to schedule your time. That’s really what it’s all about. It has nothing to do with carpeting and entertainment systems or gold plated anything or, cause I’m very down to earth when it comes to that. You know, I travel in blue jeans all the time and t-shirt cause that’s the way I lived most of my life.</p>
<p>Jon Udell: But you go when you go when and where you want. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: But I go when and where I want. That’s the real luxury. And that appeals to everybody. You don’t have to be wealthy to see the value. Everybody has an intrinsic value of time. </p>
<p>So when I first left, I engaged Nancy, my uh, I think when I first left Citrix, we were just married about then, so she was transitioning from fiance to wife, um, to manage our bigger airplanes while I tried to figure out a business plan to make it, you know, like business jets for the masses. And I’ve found out very quickly that that’s a really hard problem because the deck is stacked against you.</p>
<p> The aircraft are extremely expensive. You know, a Challenger 604 is about 25, 26 million new . It’s a very high capital cost. Everything is handbuilt. It’s very high level of service, very customized service. You can’t mass produce it in any reasonable way.</p>
<p> The expectations of the customers are high. The asset utilization’s low. And believe it or not, the competition is incredible because a lot of people have bought airplanes that, throw ’em at the charter to offset costs. So it’s just like all the elements of a crummy business all rolled up in one. And coming right outta software, to me it was a shock to see that this was really such a bad business environment. So basically I hung it up there, I said, nah, I don’t think I wanna spend a lot of time on this.</p>
<p>Then something happened. Two things actually, since you brought it up already. I read Fallows’ book and about the same time I went to Agenda 2001 and Vern Raburn who I knew from years past, most notably from Slate, although he was at Lotus and Symantec also, Vern Raburn was pitching his new sub- million -dollar jet for the masses.</p>
<p>That was his idea. I was skeptical, knowing a little bit about airplanes, but in the same panel we had Dr. Bruce Holmes who was the head of the NASA, well, one of the A’s in NASA is aeronautics, right, it’s not all just space.</p>
<p> He was the chief strategist for the aeronautics, the small airport systems and integration and technology to utilize underutilized assets that we have in our country. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: Just as an aside, for people who haven’t read the book, there’s a subplot about NASA and about Bruce Holmes and about Dan Goldin and about how these guys in a very, kind of underground way, were really seriously trying to figure out how to reinvent air travel and find a way to utilize these 5,000 regional airports that we have around the country.</p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: Which is a huge capital investment that our country’s made.</p>
<p>Jon Udell: Exactly. Exactly. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: And yet we’re still piling everything into 15 major airports. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: Exactly. I think Bruce Holmes is the guy who clocked all of his travel door to door, for a period of years. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: He still does.</p>
<p>Jon Udell: And he found out that …</p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: Bruce works for us now. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: He does? No kidding. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: I hired him this year </p>
<p>Jon Udell: Wow. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: To be our chief strategist for next generation air traffic systems. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: That’s awesome!</p>
<p> So the story is that he clocked all of his trips and he figured out that for anything under 500 miles, it was like just as fast to drive.</p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: Exactly. </p>
<p>Which was, to me was a tremendous epiphany. Of course, we all know that. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: Yeah. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: We just never really actually took the trouble to measure it all. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: Exactly. </p>
<p> So what did he say at Agenda that turned things around for you?</p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: So I went to Agenda, which was as you know, it’s a technology conference, always has been, first and foremost. There’s a panel there, it was about aviation and it was a real oddball panel. They had Fallows, they had Dr. Holmes and they had Vern on the panel. I was already in the middle of trying to investigate how to do aviation. I was on the verge of giving up and I was looking for other things to do. And it dawned on me that what we needed to make point to point travel a reality was a platform. That’s what we were missing. The platforms were big, expensive handbuilt creatures that were bought by very, very wealthy people and, as I said, underutilized expensive assets.</p>
<p>But what we needed was something that was more akin to what the PC was before we had explosions of local area network. So it dawned on me what Vern was saying about his Eclipse –which was still a concept, this was 2001, he hadn’t really built anything yet– was an approach to what he called making the model T of business jets, and in other words, being the first mass produced precision manufactured aircraft.</p>
<p> And so that got me thinking, so I gave Vern and his wife a lift back on our airplane after agenda, back to Albuquerque with Nancy. And we went and took a look at his new facilities and immediately started thinking of software, network operating systems, and so forth. And that set the wheel in motion. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: So when you use the word platform, you are not just referring to the equivalence of the plane to the pc, but you are referring to the software systems that animate that piece hardware. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: In the early days, I looked at the airplane as the pc. I mean, this is kind of oversimplification, but let’s say that the airplane was the mass produced pc, the engines were– originally Williams and then ultimately Pratt and Whitney was the Intel making the thing that had to be mass produced to make these things a reality.</p>
<p> It was incredibly important, high value component. And then I looked at ourselves as some kind of a blend of an operating system/ network operating system/ application that laid on top of all that and it delivered low cost, point to point travel. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: Because that’s what operating systems do is resource utilization. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: Resource management. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: Okay, so we’re getting down to it. Describe what kind of network operating system you are building. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: Okay, so here’s the thing. It didn’t take very long to look at the business models and say if you take a $25 million airplane and replace it with 25 $1 million airplanes, then it fixes a lot of problems. It gives you a lot of robustness in terms of being able to service individual demands. If you couple that also, by the way, with doing it by the seat instead of by the plane. That lets you interleave packets, or payloads. It became very clear that what we need to do is build a very large self optimizing network that would take a lot of other factors into consideration.</p>
<p>Like the physics of the airplane, the temperature, the loads. The beauty of aviation is that it’s like physics meets business. How much you can carry depends on what the temperature is. The altitude, the runway lengths. Safety is all expressed in terms of parameters that you can operate under, right?</p>
<p>But now the optimizer has to take it into account as it starts shuffling around different customers. So it’s not just a straight optimization, it’s an optimization that has to be done very quickly, real time, and it has an incredible number of constraints, many, many more than you would normally have.</p>
<p>So that’s why it’s so important. You have to eliminate all the optional constraints. Like the customers that want black jelly beans. Well they ain’t, they aren’t gonna be our customers. Right. You have to be willing to take any flight. With no special services. Cause special services complicate things.</p>
<p>Jon Udell: But that’s okay. Southwest has found that people are very happy to go along with that idea. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: It’s the same, it’s the same notion. It simplifies, but, but when you’re talking about a real time on demand network, it becomes even more important. So I had to hire mathematicians. I actually had a group of folks that I’d had previous experience with in adaptive compression algorithms.</p>
<p>Really smart guys. We brought them on, gave ’em a challenge of their lifetime and actually for the rest of their lives. The problem is you never find a solution to the problem cause it’s what mathematicians called NP Hard. Which means that you can take every computer on earth that’s ever gonna be manufactured between now and the end of our lives and put it to work on the project til the end of our solar system, and you’re not gonna find the optimal solution. So you have to move from traditional hard optimization into heuristics that are aided by optimization techniques. And so then we brought in Georgia Tech, who I’m alumni of, and I’m on their engineering board, advisory board, brought in the operations research group. And these are really heavy hitter guys that have been doing optimization. Actually, some of ’em were my professors when I was at school, it was funny to see ’em again. These guys did optimization routines for large air carriers. But the difference, the essential differences is in a fixed schedule, there is a fixed schedule.</p>
<p>And optimizing assets around a fixed schedule is a vastly different problem than trying to determine the most optimal solution in real time for something that doesn’t have any fixed schedule and that’s morphing every request that comes in. Basically their response was, nobody’s ever done this, and these are the, you know, smart OR guys, and since then, MIT guys have said the same thing, you know, a lot of people.</p>
<p> It really is a problem that hasn’t been very adequately addressed. So now it looks really exciting for me cause you know, if it was just like chartering airplanes, that is not very exciting. But now we’ve got new science, new math, it’s a lot of green fields in areas that we can get collaboration of some major universities.</p>
<p>Top-notch people want to work and want to assign PhD students to work with us. An opportunity to set up a group of really smart people. And so we did that. And that’s how we got started. And that was the beginnings of the optimization. And the idea is that every reservation that comes in, you have to figure out how how to value these things.</p>
<p>So we have invented a market model where the pricing is based on how you value your time. If you value your time highly, you don’t wanna waste any time at all, you want to say, I’m gonna tell you I’m gonna be there at nine and I’ve gotta be there by 10 :30. And we know that it’s about an hour and a half flight. That’s a very expensive ticket. </p>
<p>But then if you say, I’m willing to leave as early as six in the morning and be there by noon for something that nominally takes an hour, then we can afford to give a very large discount for that seat.</p>
<p> Without knowing whether we’re gonna match anybody up or not. Statistically, we can determine pricing models. And we did that through, uh, I’ll explain in a second another area of science that we have to bring in. But, with that flexible model, that gave us the degrees of freedom that the optimizers could build some really effective schedules. And so then we used Georgia Tech team to do traditional formulations and run what we would determine in real time. They would run it over the weekend on their mesh of computers and determine if they could improve upon it with adding a lot of computational time.</p>
<p>So we’ve kind of determined that our algorithms and heuristics are within 5% or less of what ultimately might be optimal solutions for problems that you can test. Which are smaller problems. I mean, they can’t use the traditional techniques for a typical network because like I said, it’s far too big.</p>
<p>So for problems of, I don’t know, 10 airports and 20 aircraft, or 50 aircraft, they can test our optimality. It doesn’t work for 300 aircraft… </p>
<p>That was half of the problem. I don’t wanna bore you with a lot of details here, so </p>
<p>Jon Udell: It’s not boring, believe me. But feel free to move along.</p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: The other side of the equation was that we also had to knock the problem of mesh and how you parallelize things cause these problems aren’t really well suited to be solved in parallel. So we had to build a strategy around that and build a mesh computing platform and all that stuff. That’s kind of like nuts and bolts, but that went on in parallel. But the big problem that we had then, which was one that had been nagging me from the beginning was, if we really succeed at building a new market, which I believe we are, is, how do I know how many people are gonna use a service that never existed before? Especially if it’s people that maybe hadn’t even flown before. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: Yeah, this is the the web 2.0 problem of, oops, I’m too successful. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: Or, how do you determine what is gonna be successful or not? Cause these are really big asset investment decisions you have to make, you have to lay out airplanes, you have to lay out bases and people, and you have to go places and you have to do marketing investments and, believe me, there’s far more ways you can go bankrupt than there are that you can make money because as it turns out, jump forward a little bit, that these value networks, which is really what we’re building, is a value network between regional points.</p>
<p>The composition of the value network determines the load of the value network. Which is, you know, I guess intuitive to somebody that looks at networks. But from a social standpoint, it’s all the same rules apply. If I have a network of nodes A, B, C, and D and I add E, that could have an impact on all the nodes at their various times of the day.</p>
<p>But if I add F it could have impact some nodes differently than other nodes. So it’s an interrelated loading. A problem that’s very, very difficult to determine. So for that, I thought, you know, we’ve got all these guys that are taking basically chaos and organizing it into order so we can file flight plans and make it all look organized or actually be organized on the back end.</p>
<p>But what I need is another group of people that creates organized chaos or organized complexity that mimics the social behaviors of a region of travelers that can be used to test how well we can reorganize that into order. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: So you mean you need to actually be able to model…</p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: …you need to model the markets and the demand. And that’s not a simple problem either cause it’s gonna depend on pricing and value, time/ value trade offs and density of your transportation network and what nodes you introduce and what the interactions between the nodes are, cause every city has a different effect than others.</p>
<p> For that, I thought, you know, I did study operations research way back when and never really used it heavily, but one of the things I always loved was modeling. And, in fact, before even did Citrix, my other alternative plan was doing something similar to what Maxis did, and that’s built a platform for large scale simulations and never did that.</p>
<p>They did a marvelous job, by the way. I’m thinking the kind of thing that Sim City represented in a generic sense is the kind of technology we wanna bring in. And that happens to be, the modern phraseology for that is complexity science.</p>
<p>When I was at school it was discrete time simulation, but then it got a biological twist to it. And so it became complexity science. At one point in time it was called chaos theory, but complexity science is more, uh, accepted terminology for it. And I had some people that I had done some work with, in fact, through one of my directors , we had both served on the board of a Bios institute in Santa Fe, which was an offshoot of the Santa Fe Institute, which was biological modeling or evolutionary modeling of large complex systems.</p>
<p>So we got in touch with some of those folks, and really, really smart guys that have been doing this all their lives, and we offered ’em a job. We said, Hey, come on board and we’re gonna build the most sophisticated regional traveler model that anybody’s ever built that’s gonna have a great deal of fidelity.</p>
<p>They were gonna use it not just for postulating the future, but actually for building a business. And integrating that as part of our long term planning systems. And so they came on and worked for about four years. And the result was this other piece of technology, which gets married to our system, which is called ABM.</p>
<p>We call it ABM. It’s not very imaginative. It’s agent based model. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: Not anti ballistic missile. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: No, no. And it’s basically, I mean, the simplest way to describe it is, it’s Sim City on steroids. A commercial grade Sim City on steroids. Very targeted on the specific problem of regional travel.</p>
<p> So we’ve got like nine different types of agents or sims that operate and they’re populated according to IRS statistics and 10 square mile zones in the country. And they all have different rules on how they book trips and what flexibility they have. </p>
<p>And then we loaded on top of that a bunch of demographic data. Some we bought, some we got from DOT, some we got from IRS. And then we loaded on top of that all the schedules for all the airlines between all the airports in the contiguous 48. And then we actually developed some driving algorithms so we can estimate driving times. Not great circle, but actual routes and added congestion, time of day congestion through various nodes when driving.</p>
<p>Then we added train schedules and basically had this very sophisticated, very high fidelity model of the transportation options that you would face if you lived in one 10 square mile region of the US and needed to go to another one. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: That’s pretty amazing, that’d be a useful service in and of itself.</p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: Well, the interesting thing is after we started developing that, that’s when we started doing a lot more work with the FAA, DOT, NASA, uh, actually not only Eclipse, but Pratt and Whitney, then GE when they came into the market, and Honda and Embraer. And so, you know, we’re a little startup company, but we’ve pretty much been in the business of trying to plot out the future, and the manufacturers started sending us design specs for power plants and hypothetical airplanes.</p>
<p> We actually found that we had to build some real Chinese firewalls. Cause we were getting all this confidential data from competitors to see how does this airplane design work in loading, you know? So we were able to make some really quantitative assessment. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: Well, this leads into another question I was getting ready to ask, which is that presumably you’re not gonna be the only such service operating on the planet. At some point there comes the need to federate these things, right?</p>
<p> It sounds like this other piece that you’ve built is potentially part of the answer to how you are able to make that happen.</p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: Well, lemme back up one second. One thing that I need to add that’s a complexity or actually a reality check, of this whole thing, that was the biggest curve that we had to handle as we went through this. As a technologist, longtime technologist, I’d like to look at the problem, break down in pieces, and then figure out, in this case, how could we build an ASP service? Or how do we get the federation of this across a bunch of people that are buying assets?</p>
<p>Cause I don’t really wanna buy airplanes and run ’em. But it turns out, interestingly and surprisingly, one of the constraints that we have to live with is the regulatory environment we’re in today. Which winds up being a great, big reality test. You can’t build a business that requires this kind of an investment having in your business plan an assumption that you’re gonna change regulations to make it happen.</p>
<p>There’s no investor in the world that’s gonna invest in that. So one of the constraints we had on our business from the beginning was, this has to operate in the regulatory domain and environment that we have today. We better get pretty darn good at understanding how that works.</p>
<p>So right from the beginning, I started making trips to Washington, meeting with senior FAA folks. Tell them, man, listen, this stuff that NASA’s doing that we want to do in kind of a practical implementation of it, it makes a lot of sense, and we also recognize you can’t change all the rules for something doesn’t exist yet.</p>
<p>So help us understand how we follow the rules so that you can at least not feel like you have to stand in our way. So that turned out to be a long road, a very rewarding road, we built some really good relationships with the regulators. But the punchline is because there is such an interwoven relationship between operating control and safety, it’s very hard to say you own the airplane, you guys over there own the pilots, and we’ll run it. </p>
<p>Almost to play by the rules, you have to vertically integrate across the board. So you have to own the airplanes, hire the crews, train the crews, manage all the concurrency of crews, cause there’s limitations of how much they can fly in a day, a month, a year and all that stuff. So you have to manage, that’s all safety aspects, which can be done. It’s all fairly well understood rules, but you have to kind of integrate the whole thing. </p>
<p>Same with the airplane. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: So you do have to kind of own it for now. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: You have to own it all, from the trip formation, the planning, and you have to do it fast. Because if you’re gonna build a system where 95% of the trips are managed by a computer, instead of vast rooms of human beings doing flight plans, which is non-scalable by the way, then you have to be able to embody all those business and regulatory processes in a system that uses the planning tools, and to develop stuff that conforms. So we wound up building a very vertically integrated company. We used our relationship with Eclipse to put in place a very long term, large scale order for airplanes.</p>
<p>We’re working with other manufacturers as well, but mostly Eclipse right now. This has been a long, long, long road that we’ve had to travel because not only do we have to build the core technology for routing and realtime optimization, but had to develop the market models, had to run market studies to back check the market models to make sure that we’re not inhaling our own exhaust or whatever the right metaphor is, right? We had the regulatory side that we had to develop a relationship over four years, and the culmination of all that is a system that we’re about to launch, and it’s gotten a lot of attention.</p>
<p>I’m trying not to hype it a lot. But it’s one of those things that everybody wants to talk about because it’s such a compelling story. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: We’ve been hearing about it for a long time now, it’s about to get switched on in some form that people can see and experience.</p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: So what this means to you is that you’ll be able to go to that airport, in your community, and be able to say, I need to go to some other airport in my value network. I don’t think it’s the model that says you can fly anywhere you want to fly, everybody flies where they want and it’s totally open.</p>
<p>I don’t think there’s enough scale to make that make business sense, cause there’s economics of flying the airplanes, so you have to focus on what we call day ports, which are kinda like preferred airports where we do the per-seat services between, we’ve identified five and we’re gonna grow that dramatically as we go along based on customer input, actually the reservations that they make themselves tell us a lot about what direction they want to go in. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: So what are those original five non hub airports? </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: They’re all in Florida. Because we wanted to keep it all close by here so we could watch the launch carefully. It’s one in South Florida in Boca Raton, which is between Palm Beach and Fort Lauderdale, basically on the east coast. Lakeland, which is between Orlando and Tampa in the central region. Gainesville, which is where the University of Florida is and the business hub, getting up towards the panhandle, and Tallahassee, state capital, and then Pensacola way out on the panhandle. So it’s kind of like a network that initially spans the center of Florida from the east coast.</p>
<p>Jon Udell: And these are all characteristic of that group of 5,000 airports that Fallows talks about.</p>
<p>The regional, underutilized, you know, you drive up to one and there’s not a parking problem and there’s Cessnas sitting on the runway and stuff.</p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: Absolutely. Two of ’em actually have commercial traffic, but it’s very limited traffic , very limited service I should say. They go mostly through Atlanta, like Tallahassee and Gainesville are the two. To get anywhere else in the network commercially, you go through Atlanta. </p>
<p>The value in this whole thing is saving time, right? I like to say that we’re really not an aviation company or a technology company or a marketing company. We’re in the business of time arbitrage. Some people sell us their time that they don’t need. And we resell it more expensively to other people that can use it. So we use the flexibility one customer has to give , another customer that doesn’t have flexibility a service and aggregate ’em in a way that makes the business make money. </p>
<p>And it comes together. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: When do you switch this thing on? What’s the first day? </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: We actually have started turning on some customers in a controlled fashion. Because what we want to do is guarantee service level. We discovered nobody wants to use this as a business critical service if they’re gonna get rejected frequently . They may not get accepted, you know, the capacity, then we may not be able to find a solution to their request in the prescribed time, which is 10 seconds now, by the way, from the time that you tell us what you wanna do, we’ll tell you whether we can do it or not in 10 seconds. And it’s all done virtually, right? Because there’s no real airplanes, or this is all done in advance. So we have a virtual mapping of what the capacity of the network is. And so we can construct a yea or a nay answer. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: So if you make a promise that you can do it, you don’t necessarily have complete knowledge at that moment about all of the components that are that are gonna satisfy that request, right?</p>
<p>You’re making a bet and, and it’s a good bet. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: Well, it’s more than a bet. We know we can do it. We don’t know with what assets, we know we’ve got 10 virtual airplanes that are gonna be available that day. And we know we’ve made X number of commitments for these windows.</p>
<p>And we know we’ve got the virtual crews. Now the reality of it is, which one is it gonna be and what the sequencing is gonna be, and when we pick you up and drop you off, and what order the airplanes fly around in that’s changing all the time.</p>
<p>And what the load will be and therefore what your profit will or won’t be. </p>
<p>And every request that comes in disrupts the previous schedule, but it gives us an opportunity to find a better schedule. It not schedule. It’s planned basically. Schedule implies that we publish it. We don’t, that’s one of the things we had to do that made this all hard, is to operate under the on-demand rules we couldn’t publish a schedule. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: So that also leads to this other question, which is, I heard Esther Dyson talking about this topic recently, and she said, like you said, it’s really not about the airplanes, it is though an awful lot about the customer experience. What’s your sense of how people react to this highly dynamic environment in which I’m presuming you might get a number of updates as to, well now you’re leaving at such and such time, right? </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: Well that, you know, this is what we’ve been grappling with for the last six months.</p>
<p>We know how to make it work. We know how to scale it. We know how to make the business work, and we know approximately the demand that we’re gonna see because we’ve been investing a lot in developing markets and customers in advance. What we’ve been grappling with is how do we take this basically entirely fluid system… </p>
<p>Jon Udell: …and present it to people…</p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: and present it in a way that people can reliably use it. And what that means is you just add more constraints and in other words, it’s not, you’re not gonna be flipped around all over the place. We start with, essentially, you negotiate as big a window as you can accept because the bigger the window, the cheaper the ticket, right? And it’s not a departure window. It’s a window in which we will complete the mission for you. And you basically have to block that outta your schedule. So if you have a lot of meetings during the day, you’re gonna necessarily be pushed to smaller windows, but that’s okay.</p>
<p>You’re more productive and then may cost a little more. But it allows you to be productive. If you don’t have any hard commitments one way or the other, you can give us a bigger travel window, and then somewhere in there, the flight will be generated.</p>
<p>Now, obviously you can’t say to somebody, you know, you negotiated all morning to get me from A to B, which is maybe an hour flight . People don’t feel comfortable with that, so you have to shrink that down. So then the next challenge operationally is, How do you shrink those windows down over time as you get closer to flight time?</p>
<p>Leaving enough space in the windows for disruption recovery, and not flooding on notifications. So there’s a fine balance and we’re learning that. And really what we’ve discovered is the night before we can crunch it down pretty much.</p>
<p> The big windows are useful for us in the days leading up to the travel because that’s when we’re doing most of our optimizing. When we get right before the day of travel, we can afford to crunch that down pretty far. So we crunch the window down to a much smaller size and we notify the customer the night before, that they have to be at the airport by time X, and they’ll be at their destination by time Y and leaving a little room for wiggling around for us in that. That’s our commitment and it’s a reasonable window, you know? So maybe an hour flight they may have to allocate two hours to get there. Which is far better than driving or anything else.</p>
<p>Jon Udell: Exactly, exactly. It’s like, what’s it compared to? So this is absolutely fascinating, Ed, this is so cool. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: Yeah, it’s fun because it’s like, I feel like we’re kind of inventing a market, not inventing, but we’re pioneering a market and a customer set and it’s all those things that we’ve learned over the years, all packaged up in something that doesn’t look like technology, but it is all about deployment and acceptance of technology. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: Wow. Thank you so much for making the time to do this and congratulations on getting to this point. I know you said it was a long road, but on the other hand, I mean what you’ve done in I think not much more than five years…</p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: right, it’s five years…</p>
<p>Jon Udell: seems like a hell of a lot.</p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: Well, it does when you look back on it, but you know, we’ll see. And the true test is gonna be the customers and I think they’re gonna be happy with it. So we’ll just stay tuned. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: All right. Well, thanks so much, Ed. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: Take care, Jon. </p>
<p>Yeah, you too. </p>

<p>Rule-based, actor model systems are a great match for IoT workloads.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a05cc98-7584-4caa-ba82-41754649a6b1_2904x2214.png">    </a>Temperature Sensor Network Built from Picos <p>Picos are a <a href="https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/overview">rule-based system for programming in the Internet of Things (IoT)</a>. Rules are a good fit for IoT programming because so much of what happens with things is event-based. Events say something happened. They are different from commands (telling) or requests (asking). A sensor might indicate the door opened, a light came on, or the temperature passed some threshold. An actuator might indicate its current status.</p><p>Rules, triggered by an event, determine what should be done to respond to the event. IoT rule-systems use event-condition-action (ECA) rules: when something happens, if this is true, do this. Multiple rules can be triggered by the same event. This allows functionality to be layered on. For example, an event that contains the temperature reported by a sensor might also report the sensor's batter level. One rule that responds to the event can handle the temperature report and another, independent rule can handle the battery level.</p><p>Picos are an actor-model programming system. Actors are a good match for IoT programming using rules. Actors keep state information and respond to events (messages) by changing their state, taking action, and possibly raising other events. Actors provide lock-free concurrency, data isolation, location transparency, and loose coupling. These are great features to have in IoT programming because devices are naturally decentralized, each acting independently.</p><p>Building a functional system usually involves multiple picos each with a number of rules to respond to the events that pico will handle. For example, I recently <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2023/03/monitoring_temperatures_in_a_remote_pump_house_using_lorawan.shtml">built a sensor network using picos for monitoring temperatures in a remote pump house using Lorawan</a>. There is one pico for each sensor and a community sensor that manages them. The temperature sensor pico acts as a digital twin for the sensor.</p><p>As the digital twin, the sensor pico does all the things that the sensor is too low-powered (literally) to do. For example, one rule receives the heartbeat event from the sensor, decodes the payload, stores values, and raises new events with the temperature values. Another rule processes the event with the new values and checks for threshold violations. If one occurs, it raises an event to the sensor community pico. Another rule sees the new value event and takes an action that plots the new value on an external site. And there are others. The point is that rules make it easy to break up the tasks into manageable chunks that can thread execution differently, and concurrently, depending what's happening.</p><p>I've been using picos to program IoT systems for over a decade now. Rule-based, actor model systems are a great match for IoT workloads.</p><p><a href="https://www.technometria.com/p/rule-based-programming-and-the-internet/comments">Leave a comment</a></p>

<p>Co-authored by Stephan Wolf, CEO of GLEIF, and Karla McKenna, Head of Standards for&nbsp;GLEIF.</p><p>In 2014, through its Financial Stability Board (<a href="https://www.fsb.org/">FSB</a>), the <a href="https://www.g20.org/en/">G20</a> carried out one of its decisions from the aftermath of the 2008 Financial Crisis: it formed GLEIF, the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/">Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation</a>. GLEIF is as neutral as can be: it is a Swiss non-profit <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/supranational">supranational</a> entity created by mandate of the G20 and governed by its newly formed Regulatory Oversight Committee; it has no ties to any industry or&nbsp;country.</p><p>There is only one GLEIF and there can only be one GLEIF, formed by the 20 largest countries on Earth to do one thing: manage the issuance of globally unique 20-character identifiers to legal entities anywhere that follow the stringent requirements to get one. But the FSB formed GLEIF only after exploring all other options, and after the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) had already been conceived; GLEIF was created to bring the LEI to the world, not the other way&nbsp;around.</p> Why Create a New Identifier? <p>The inspiration behind the LEI standard is fully captured in the <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1723298">“linchpin” paper</a> written in 2010 by John Bottega and Linda Powell, with contributions from many US and other regulators who would later join the Regulatory Oversight Committee (ROC), formed by the G20 to oversee GLEIF. To understand the many global factors that played into the decision by global regulators to conceive the LEI, and the detailed explanations of why existing identifiers would not be suitable, read that paper. For these reasons the regulatory community asked ISO to create a standard for a Legal Entity Identifier (LEI), and to establish a global business-register-like facility in an open, federated, non-proprietary operating model.</p><p>Instrumental for creating this ISO LEI standard was Karla McKenna, now head of standards for GLEIF. Well before the FSB’s decision to create the Global LEI System, Karla was helping regulators develop the business requirements for the LEI to address vulnerabilities discovered by the FSB’s post-financial crisis investigation. At that time she worked for Citibank, and happened to be the chair of the ISO technical committee responsible for financial standards including the Business Identifier Code (<a href="https://www.swift.com/standards/data-standards/bic-business-identifier-code">BIC</a>). This experience made Karla intimately familiar with the strengths and weaknesses of the BIC and other entity identifiers, and ideally suited to analyze the appropriateness of any system that would satisfy the FSB’s requirements.</p><p>In case it were feasible, it was initially considered for the FSB to adopt and tweak an existing identifier system rather than develop a new one, but the list of requirements made it clear early on that nothing existing would work. That list of requirements, detailed at length in the “linchpin” paper referenced above, included the following:</p>  International standard — the identifier must be an international standard  Unique — no duplicate identifiers  Permanent — identifiers must be permanently registered to their legal entities (also see Persistent below)  Persistent — identifiers and records will not be deleted from the registry; updates in status will be used for identifiers that have been retired, for&nbsp;example  No embedded intelligence — An identifier must not contain any embedded intelligence about the legal entity being identified. For example, embedding another identifier that identifies the legal entity within an identifier is not permitted. Identification is referential using the identifier reference data&nbsp;records.  Freely accessible — there must be no costs to data users, no licensing required, and no restrictions on copying, publishing, distributing, transmitting, citing or adapting identifiers and associated reference data.  <p>One by one these requirements eliminated existing identifier systems from consideration, and with Karla’s research and assistance the decision to develop a new kind of legal entity identifier was confirmed by the FSB, and the LEI — and GLEIF to manage it — were&nbsp;born.</p> LEI Adoption <p>GLEIF’s mandate from the FSB was straightforward:</p>  Develop an international standard (<a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/about-lei/iso-17442-the-lei-code-structure">ISO 17442</a>) for strongly verifying the existence and primary attributes of legal entities in any jurisdiction in the&nbsp;world;  Enlist Local Operating Units (LOUs) throughout the world to perform the standardized vetting process for a nominal fee (there’s now 40 LOUs globally, GLEIF itself does not perform the vetting, they just manage the&nbsp;rules);  Use the LOUs to issue a globally unique 20-character <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/about-lei/introducing-the-legal-entity-identifier-lei">Legal Entity Identifier</a> (LEI) to legal entities who are successfully vetted;  Maintain a free, publicly available registry of all LEI holders’ records that follows the requirements above, a veritable ‘registry of registries’.  <p>Any legal entity that pays the annual fee — which varies, it’s set by each Local Operating Unit and not mandated — will have their primary attributes strongly vetted: legal name, address, jurisdiction, and parent-child relationships to other legal entities. The result is the issuance of an LEI, a rigorous, standardized, neutral, globally acceptable legal entity identifier.</p><p>Here are some examples:</p><p>JP Morgan Chase Bank: <a href="https://search.gleif.org/#/record/8I5DZWZKVSZI1NUHU748">8I5DZWZKVSZI1NUHU748</a></p><p>Coca Cola: <a href="https://search.gleif.org/#/record/UWJKFUJFZ02DKWI3RY53">UWJKFUJFZ02DKWI3RY53</a></p><p>Halifax Hospital Medical Center: <a href="https://search.gleif.org/#/record/549300H6HDJUXLEMUW23">549300H6HDJUXLEMUW23</a></p><p>The Glen at Hiland Meadows: <a href="https://search.gleif.org/#/record/5493000F7PSK3TI9IH08">5493000F7PSK3TI9IH08</a></p><p>State of Washington: <a href="https://search.gleif.org/#/record/549300X3TODFMUKLQ364">549300X3TODFMUKLQ364</a></p><p>Bank of China: <a href="https://search.gleif.org/#/record/549300KIPGRYLXDQDD87">549300KIPGRYLXDQDD87</a></p><p>Dominos Pizza Australia: <a href="https://search.gleif.org/#/record/54930034RFI409JZ3179">54930034RFI409JZ3179</a></p><p>African Development Fund: <a href="https://search.gleif.org/#/record/549300GT4BDQ5463KW73">549300GT4BDQ5463KW73</a></p><p>United Nations: <a href="https://search.gleif.org/#/record/549300HYGYJKXU2J8X74">549300HYGYJKXU2J8X74</a></p><p>LEI adoption is accelerating. LEIs are now <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/lei-solutions/regulatory-use-of-the-lei">used</a> in the financial sector in every industrialized country, with rapidly growing adoption in other industries and global trade. An LEI is now <a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/library/esma74-362-388_lei_statement_sftr.pdf">required</a> for any company to be listed on any EU stock exchange, regardless of industry. 2.3 million LEIs have been issued so&nbsp;far.</p> The vLEI: Binding Flesh-to-Digital <p>The LEI is not an ‘authenticator’ or ‘authorizer’, it’s just a 20-character alphanumeric string. An LEI tells you precisely which organization someone claims to represent, but alone provides no way to verify that claim. An LEI is like a Social Security Number, birthday, or any other number that can be easily written onto a piece of paper: the binding between the identifier and the individual presenting it must be verified separately and manually.</p><p>Many governments globally try to solve this for citizens with unique ID cards equipped with a RFI-ready chip. This way a natural person could prove his/her existence and identity across many boundaries, but this is not possible for legal entities; national ID cards for citizens do not convey the binding between an entity and its representatives, and neither does any form of identity in the digital realm. Online or offline, you could prove that Steve Smith is Steve Smith, but not that he works for ACME Inc. or that he’s the CFO, authorized to sign financial statements on behalf of&nbsp;ACME.</p><p>For this reason GLEIF developed the “verifiable LEI” or “vLEI” using verifiable credentials and other open standards: to create a verifiable binding between an organization and its representatives, binding flesh to digital. When first learning of the vLEI some think that an entity that has an LEI can somehow now prove its existence, but that is only partly true; the vLEI is actually a verifiable credential that must be held by a person, a human being, because entities can act only through&nbsp;people.</p><p>We’ve found this point to be confusing to people, so we’ll say it again a different way: when a legal entity is required to make a regulatory filing, for example, it has no way to act for itself to make the filing, some human with authority must attest to its validity. Even if a submission process is automated, any filing with a regulator must be accountably signed by someone with the requisite authority. Organizations don’t make calls, send messages, or make statements; ultimately, people with authority to represent the organization do those things, or they don’t happen. Imagine the absurd opposite, a CEO saying, “I had no idea, none of us humans knew a thing about it, the company just did it by&nbsp;itself.”</p><p>Simply put, organizations can’t act for themselves, people act on an organization’s behalf, as representatives, and the vLEI makes it globally provable when they do, for the first&nbsp;time.</p> Decentralized Organizational Identity and Verifiable Authority <p>The vLEI acts as a first or root-level “organizational credential” (OC) for an entity, provably binding top-level authorized representatives to the legal entity. This first OC forms the basis of Decentralized Organizational Identity (OI), as now the organization has the power to delegate credentials and authority throughout the organization, enabling every authorized person (or thing) to prove the scope of their authority in the digital realm anywhere they please, inside or outside the organization’s boundaries.</p><p>Never before has it been possible for representatives of an organization to do this. The recent advent of verifiable credentials in the world of decentralized identity first made it possible for data to be portable across digital boundaries, and now the LEI and vLEI take that breakthrough capability and use it to convey a provable line of authority, from any representative back through unlimited levels of delegation all the way to the legal entity&nbsp;itself.</p><p>We call it “verifiable authority”. It’s gonna be&nbsp;big.</p><p>To learn more, see “<a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/the-dawn-of-decentralized-organizational-identity-part-1-identifiers-ffb9091fd47a">The Dawn of Decentralized Organizational Identity, Part 1: Identifiers</a>.”</p>

<p>
I’d been needing to refactor the pagination logic in the <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-mastodon">Mastodon plugin</a> for <a href="https://steampipe.io">Steampipe</a>. After a couple of abortive tries, I took another run at it this week with the help of the latest generation of LLM-powered coding assistants.</p>
<p>
Here was the problem. The pre-release version of the plugin consolidated pagination for many tables in one place. That was a good thing, but the downside was that there was only one Steampipe table which represented what should have been many of them. So you could say select * from mastodon_timeline but then you had qualify with where timeline = 'home' or where timeline = 'local' and so on. For a user of the plugin this was awkward, you’d rather say select * from mastodon_timeline_home or select * from mastodon_timeline_local, and reserve the where clause for more specific purposes. The v1 plugin made separate tables, but duplicated the pagination logic on a per-table basis. It worked, and was good enough to ship the plugin in time to demo at <a href="https://fediforum.org/2023-03/">FediForum</a>, but it obviously needed improvement. </p>
 ChatGPT-4 and Sourcegraph Cody 
<p>
Since then, Sourcegraph has released its new coding assistant, <a href="https://sourcegraph.com/cody">Cody</a>, which you can run as a VSCode extension or on sourcegraph.com. This set up the possibility for an interesting comparison. ChatGPT-4 builds on OpenAI’s LLM; Sourcegraph’s Cody, on the other hand, uses Anthropic’s <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/index/introducing-claude">Claude</a>.</p>
<p>
Another key difference is that ChatGPT only has the context you paste into it. Cody, sitting inside VSCode, can see your repository and has all that context. And if you index your repo, which is something Sourcegraph are willing to do for beta users on request, then Cody has access to what are called <a href="https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/cody-is-cheating#sourcegraph-platform-101">embeddings</a> that represent the structure of your code in various ways. These embeddings, according to Sourcegraph, can powerfully enhance your LLM prompts. Even without embeddings, Cody offers quite a range of assistance, from a high-level overview of what your repo does to line-level improvement. It’s all packaged, in the extension, as a set of recipes behind buttons with names like Explain selected code, Improve variable names, and Smell code. I haven’t yet used these recipes enough to form solid opinions, though. For this exercise I used Cody mostly in a ChatGPT-like conversational way. In that mode, it’s wonderful to be able to select the code you want to talk about, instead of pasting it into the chat.</p>
<p>
In both cases, as should be no surprise, it wasn’t enough to just ask the tools to consolidate the pagination logic. They were perfectly happy to propose solutions that could never work and might not even compile. So I began with a simpler version of the problem. Mastodon uses the same pagination machinery for APIs that return arrays of different kinds of results: Statuses (toots), Accounts, and Notifications. By focusing on these separately I reduced the duplicate pagination from 13 instances to three. Then, in a separate pass, I worked out how to collapse those into a single paginate function that accepted one of three data-fetching function parameters.</p>
<p>
I tried to pay careful attention to prompts and completions as I went along, but in the heat of the action I didn’t do a great job of that, partly because I was switching back and forth between the two tools. But I’m quite happy with the result. There was one key insight in particular which, fascinatingly, I am hard pressed to assign credit for. Was it me or one of the assistants? I think it was me, but in a way that doesn’t matter, and isn’t the point of this story.</p>
 The key insight 
<p>
Here was the insight. When I was building the transitional paginateStatus function, the first attempt returned results to the calling code in each table’s List function, which was responsible for streaming the data to Steampipe. This led to a series of detours to work around the problem that the returned data could be quite large, and chew up a lot of memory. That could probably be solved with a goroutine that would stream results back to the caller, instead of returning them as a batch. I tried prodding both LLMs to come up with that kind of solution, had no luck with several tries in both cases, but then came the insight. The helper functions could stream results directly to Steampipe, and just return nil or err to the calling List function. </p>
<p>
With that dramatic simplication I was able to complete the phase 1 refactoring, which yielded three pagination functions: paginateStatus, paginateAccount, and paginateNotification. Phase 2, which consolidated those into a single paginate function, was a bit more prosaic. I did need some help understanding how the necessary switch statements could switch on the timeline types passed into the paginate function. Both assistants had seen lots of examples of this pattern, and both helpfully augmented my imperfect knowledge of golang idioms.</p>
 Partnering with machine intelligence 
<p>
I came away with a profound sense that the real value of these assistants isn’t any particular piece of code that they get “right” or “wrong” but rather the process of collaborating with them. When you’re working alone, you have an ongoing conversation with yourself, usually in your own head. The point of talking to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">rubber duck</a> is to voice that conversation so you can more effectively reason about it. Externalizing your thinking in that way is intrinsically valuable. But when the rubber duck talks back, it’s a whole new game. As Garry Kasparov <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/07/11/working-with-intelligent-machines/">famously wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The winner was revealed to be not a grandmaster with a state-of-the-art PC but a pair of amateur American chess players using three computers at the same time. Their skill at manipulating and coaching their computers to look very deeply into positions effectively counteracted the superior chess understanding of their grandmaster opponents and the greater computational power of other participants. Weak human + machine + better process was superior to a strong computer alone and, more remarkably, superior to a strong human + machine + inferior process.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
I’m not worried about robot overlords. Instead, I look forward to collaborating with robot partners.</p>

 The Dawn of Organizational Identity, Part 1: Identifiers <p>Thanks to Stephan Wolf, CEO of GLEIF, who co-authored this article, and to Karla McKenna, Managing Director at GLEIF Americas, who contributed significantly, and to dozens of other smart people who contributed their time and insights.</p> Organizational Identity (OI)&nbsp;Defined: <p>The ability of a person or thing to prove their authority to represent an organization outside the boundaries of that organization.</p><p>We would add “without using identity providers, blockchains, or proprietary/shared platforms”, but it is still possible to accomplish OI using those things (just not as well). OI is powered by the breakthroughs of second-generation verifiable credentials (VCs), described in <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/the-dawn-of-decentralized-organizational-identity-part-2-organizational-credentials-d8baf5fd9114">Part&nbsp;2</a>.</p><p>OI is ultimately about “verifiable authority”, also described in <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/the-dawn-of-decentralized-organizational-identity-part-2-organizational-credentials-d8baf5fd9114">Part&nbsp;2</a>.</p> A Glimpse Into the&nbsp;Future <p>When the authority of a person or thing claiming it can be instantly verified, whether in the physical or digital realm, the world will be different…</p>  The authenticity of any digital document, agreement, purchase order, filing, or other piece of data will be instantly verifiable;  Phone calls, texts, email, and other digital communications originating from authorized representatives (or devices) of an organization — or any delegate from that organization — will be instantly verifiable;  Some documents will prevent signing and some systems won’t be accessible without the expected authority (a parallel to access control&nbsp;lists);  The authority of every approval, signature, or other digital action in a supply chain will be instantly verifiable by downstream actors, and irrefutably auditable in real-time;  Authority will be verified before identity in most interactions, and identity not at all in&nbsp;many;  <p>The examples above are B2B, but verifiable authority is equally beneficial B2C:</p>  Legitimate AI/bots will prove legitimacy by digitally signing all content they&nbsp;produce;  Phishing will become more rare and difficult for fraudsters, as proving authority becomes nearly impossible for impersonators;  Citizens and customers will use digital credentials rather than passwords to login to government and industry, and will be instantly authenticated when they call in, walk in, or&nbsp;login;  Secure, private, decentralized peer-to-peer messaging that’s more secure than Signal will replace most email and phone calls between individuals and organizations (or their operators/delegates), with each side using the messaging platform of their&nbsp;choice;  Irrefutable digital receipts will become ubiquitous;  A car (and its driver) will wirelessly verify the authority of approaching law enforcement or emergency vehicles;  <p>And on and on, limited only by one’s imagination. To put it simply: soon any person or thing will be able to prove the scope of their authority to represent an organization — anywhere — and it will be instant, expected, and commonplace.</p><p>And importantly, this future doesn’t require intermediaries: ‘identity providers’ (IDPs), blockchains, proprietary platforms, or shared platforms. Like email, we’ll need services that we can build ourselves or buy from someone else, but everyone will make this choice for themselves, without the need for or involvement of ‘trusted’ or ‘shared’ intermediaries.</p> Why People and&nbsp;Things? <p>If this new market category is called organizational identity, why is the definition about people and&nbsp;things?</p><p>Because organizations don’t act, people and things do (and that includes AI and&nbsp;bots).</p><p>Organizations don’t enter into agreements, send messages, make filings… people and things do, as authorized representatives for an organization. Imagine a CEO saying: “None of us did that, we didn’t know a thing about it, the company did that.” It’s nonsensical. People derive authority from an organization’s founding documents, then they delegate and use that authority. The organization may not disclose which representatives authorized a particular action, which makes it appear like the organization acted for itself, but there is always someone whose authority is responsible for the&nbsp;action.</p><p>With OI, an org’s representatives will be able to instantly prove that authority anywhere, no matter how many levels deep in the organization they may&nbsp;be.</p><p>Of course the first aspect of organizational identity (OI) is literally the identity of the organization, but that’s just the beginning; the thing that justifies OI as an important new category of digital identity is that it’s now possible to instantly verify the authority of an organization’s representatives outside the boundaries of the organization, which simply wasn’t possible until recently with the advent of verifiable credentials (VCs).</p><p>And OI is predicated on knowing precisely for which organization authority is being claimed, which is not as easy as it sounds. More on that&nbsp;later.</p> Why Only Legal Entities? <p>Many kinds of organizations may not technically be legal entities but are fully capable of being uniquely identified and issuing verifiable credentials to their members. These include government organizations, clubs, associations, syndicates, NGOs, mutual funds, tribes, family offices, and other groups that may not have legal status but are organizations in the truest sense of the&nbsp;word.</p><p>However… the problem with extending the definition of OI to include non-legal entities comes when attempting to verify a credential they’ve issued: until some vetting resource exists that can strongly attest to the existence of a non-legal organization to help verifiers differentiate it from imposters — like proxy identifiers do for legal entities globally, described in detail further down — we see no way for a verifier to be sure that an issued credential came from the organization claimed.</p><p>Until that time, OI — and the verifiable authority it enables — should be limited to strongly vetted legal entities.</p> Why Now? <p>Organizations and their representatives have existed for centuries, so why is now the ‘dawn’ of organizational identity?</p><p>It’s one thing to claim to represent an organization, quite another to prove it. Being ‘digital’ is not enough; many things are digital today but we still don’t have “B2B ID”, a way for representatives from one organization to instantly verify the digital claims, signatures, messages or other digital objects from another. We don’t have “B2C ID” either, where people can verify representatives of organizations rather than just the other way around. This ‘verifiable authority’ is now feasible through the use of organizational credentials (OCs), described in <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/the-dawn-of-decentralized-organizational-identity-part-2-organizational-credentials-d8baf5fd9114">Part&nbsp;2</a>.</p><p>But first things first: before authority can be strongly verified, its source must first be strongly identified; it does no good to prove representation of an organization without first uniquely identifying who that organization is.</p> Organizational Identity (OI) Components <p>OI has two components:</p>  Unique identifiers for the org and its representatives (described here, in Part&nbsp;1);  Authority credentials for representatives (described later, in <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/the-dawn-of-decentralized-organizational-identity-part-2-organizational-credentials-d8baf5fd9114">Part&nbsp;2</a>).  <p>The first component, Identifiers, includes two&nbsp;kinds:</p>  Legal Entity Identifier — An unambiguous and unique identifier of a legal entity externally assigned after a rigorous vetting&nbsp;process.  Unique Identifiers for Individual Representatives — Unique (within the entity) internally assigned identifiers for representatives.  <p>From this foundation of identifiers, Organizational Credentials (OCs) are now possible. OCs are what bring OI to life in the digital (and sometimes physical) realm: they’re how an organization’s representatives can instantly and digitally prove their authority to act on its&nbsp;behalf.</p> Strongly Vetted Legal Entity&nbsp;Identity <p>The first type of identifier — for the legal entity — is straightforward: it is a unique, unambiguous, usually alphanumeric identifier resulting from the strong vetting of an organization legally established somewhere in the world. It can be globally unique if it is a “proxy” identifier (described below) or it may be nationally or regionally unique if it is an “official” identifier, but in either case it must be strongly&nbsp;vetted.</p><p>Why? Because if the vetting isn’t done in a reliably consistent and rigorous manner, we cannot be sure, especially in the digital realm, that we’re dealing with the entity we think we are. And if a regionally unique identifier attempts to be used nationally or internationally, we could run into the same&nbsp;problem.</p> “Official” and “Proxy” Entity Identifiers <p>There are two types of legal entity identifiers: official and&nbsp;proxy.</p><p>Official identifiers are issued and required by government and cannot be replaced or substituted. These are the official identifiers entities need to pay taxes, register for programs, make regulatory filings, and so on. They are issued either regionally or nationally and are unique within the scope of their issuance, but may not be globally unique as they aren’t required to&nbsp;be.</p><p>Though required for use for official purposes, official identifiers can be problematic for use outside their intended scope, for several&nbsp;reasons:</p>  They may not be&nbsp;unique;  They do not cover all types of legal entities;  The associated data may not be current (moves, mergers, name changes,&nbsp;etc.);  There are over 1,000 official registries around the world, it can be difficult to know which one to verify&nbsp;against;  Each registry comes with own allocation rules (not consistent);  Records are in local language, making it difficult to use them in cross-border scenarios;  Not all official registries have strong tools for accessing their&nbsp;data;  Some registries charge for data&nbsp;access;  Multiple registries may have conflicting data for the same&nbsp;entity.  <p>Proxy identifiers are additional identifiers issued from reputable issuers for a given purpose (see the next section for a list of top issuers and purposes). Proxy identifiers may confirm and utilize data found in official, publicly available registries, but also may rely on self-attested data, depending on the purpose. Proxy identifiers are intended to be globally unique, unambiguous and useful across both regional and national&nbsp;borders.</p><p>Proxy identifiers are not official or authoritative; unlike official identifiers there is no authority behind them that can levy taxes or penalties or impose legal or regulatory requirements on the entity. Proxy identifiers are reference identifiers, enabling their users to uniquely refer to a particular entity within their intended purpose, though some proxy identifiers are required by regulators in specific industries, such as the BIC in banking, the GLN in supply chain, the TIN in customs, and the LEI in financial transactions.</p> Global Proxy Entity Identifier Registries <p>There are many regional and national official identifier registries, but only a few proxy identifier systems attempt global scale. This is where proxy identifiers really shine, each with a distinct makeup and purpose appropriate for how it’s&nbsp;used:</p><p><a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/about-lei/introducing-the-legal-entity-identifier-lei">Legal Entity Identifier</a> (LEI), <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/75998.html">ISO 17442</a>, managed by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gleif.org/">GLEIF</a></p>  Purpose: strongly, consistently vet and uniquely identify legal entities in all jurisdictions that can participate in financial transactions and international trade  <p><a href="https://www.gs1.org/standards/id-keys/gln">Global Location Number</a> (GLN), <a href="https://www.gs1.org/standards/gs1-application-standard-usage-isoiec-6523-international-code-designator-icd-0209/current-standard">ISO 6523</a>, managed by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gs1.org/">GS1</a></p>  Purpose: uniquely identify physical locations, operational locations, legal entities, and business functions primarily in supply chain and international trade  <p><a href="https://www.dnb.com/duns.html">Data Universal Numbering System</a> (DUNS), managed by <a href="https://www.dnb.com/">Dun &amp; Bradstreet</a></p>  Purpose: for businesses associated with a D&amp;B Live Business Identity (proprietary) for evaluation of the credit-worthiness  <p><a href="https://www.swift.com/standards/data-standards/bic-business-identifier-code">Business Identifier Code</a> (BIC), <a href="https://www.iso9362.org/">ISO 9362</a>, managed by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.swift.com/">SWIFT</a></p>  Purpose: addressing messages, routing business transactions and identifying business parties — “operations parties”, not necessarily legal entities — primarily in financial transaction messaging  <p><a href="https://www.wcoomd.org/-/media/wco/public/global/pdf/topics/facilitation/instruments-and-tools/tools/trader-identification-number/guidelines-on-trader-identification-number.pdf">Trader Identification Number</a> (TIN), managed by the <a href="https://www.wcoomd.org/">World Customs Organization</a></p>  Purpose: to uniquely identify exporters/economic operators in a country (the TIN uses official national identifiers as a prefix for uniqueness)   One of These is Not Like the Others: GLEIF’s&nbsp;LEI  Unique in&nbsp;Purpose <p>Each of these identifiers is useful for precisely the purpose it was designed, but the LEI is best suited as a root of trust for Organizational Identity because it is focused exclusively on the core attribute necessary to make Organizational Credentials authoritative: legal authority.</p><p>That is not a knock against other proxy identifiers, they are suited well for their stated purposes, but GLEIF’s purpose is directly aligned with the needs of OI: all legal entities that can participate in financial transactions — nothing more, nothing&nbsp;less.</p> Unique in Structure <p>GLEIF does not and has not issued any of the 2.3 million issued LEIs; they’ve all been issued by independent <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/about-lei/get-an-lei-find-lei-issuing-organizations/">Local Operating Units</a> (LOUs) who typically offer other, often adjacent products and services. GLEIF collects all LEIs and associated data from the LOUs, the decentralized origin of LEI data who must also publish it on their websites.</p><p>GLEIF is closer to a standards body, a keeper of the rigorous, detailed rules by which entities must be vetted before an LOU can issue an LEI to a legal&nbsp;entity.</p> Unique in Transparency <p>All LEI data for all 2.3 million issued LEIs is <a href="https://search.gleif.org/#/search/">publicly available</a> and can be used for any purpose and without the need to inform GLEIF, free of any copyright or intellectual property restrictions. The data is also available barrier-free on the GLEIF website as complete files or via&nbsp;API.</p><p>GLEIF also publishes two other critical things: the rules for entity vetting and the processes for maintaining data quality over time. Without published rules for entity vetting — which we’ve been so far unable to find for other proxy entity identifier systems — it would be unknown how it’s done or to what standard of rigor. GLEIF’s independent Local Operating Units (LOUs) are measured on how well they adhere to these published rules and are accredited for compliance, with the results aggregated into published data quality&nbsp;reports.</p><p>GLEIF also publishes 3,250+ forms (types) of legal entities in over 175 jurisdictions. The <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/about-lei/code-lists/iso-20275-entity-legal-forms-code-list#">list</a> contains legal forms/types in their native language, such as limited liability companies (Ltd), Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung (GmbH) or Société Anonyme&nbsp;(SA).</p> GLEIF Has No Authority Over&nbsp;Entities <p>As with all proxy identifiers, GLEIF has no authority to create, change, or influence any legal entities; it has authority only over its own LOUs and Qualified vLEI Issuers (QVIs). Regulatory or other authorities can and often do require LEIs for legal entities under their purview, but that is completely independent of&nbsp;GLEIF.</p><p>When an LEI is obtained by an entity, it is literally owned by that entity, permanently; it may be listed as ‘lapsed’ if the associated data is not annually maintained, but it will never be recycled and it cannot be revoked, by mandated the rules of the Regulatory Oversight Committee, which was formed by the G20 to oversee GLEIF. Owning an LEI does not give an organization any additional authority, it simply represents an attestation from a credible third party that their legal entity&nbsp;exists.</p><p>In contrast, identifiers issued by state-controlled authorities have all the power and authority of the government, from legal existence to taxes to rules of operation and&nbsp;more.</p> Unique In Neutrality <p>GLEIF is neutral, it favors no country, no industry, no company — it is the ‘Switzerland’ of proxy identifier systems, literally headquartered in Switzerland — and well suited as a foundational and globally acceptable root of trust for Organizational Identity.</p> Unique in Decentralization <p>Anyone familiar with cryptocurrencies and other Web3 innovations — NFTs, smart contracts, DAOs, blockchains — has undoubtedly heard a lot about the ideal of decentralization: the diluting of authority from one central actor to many participants in a given&nbsp;system.</p><p>The key word here is “authority”.</p><p>If LEIs conveyed or imbued some kind of authority, then it mIght be considered antithetical to the goals of decentralization; but LEIs are referencial, not authoritative. As mentioned above, GLEIF has no authority over any entity that has an LEI; it is simply a third-party attester that an entity exists, similar to how <a href="https://onfido.com/">Onfido</a> or <a href="https://www.jumio.com/">Jumio</a> vets identity for individuals, albeit a globally credible one by virtue of its neutral standing as a Swiss non-profit creation of the&nbsp;G20.</p><p>Actual authority begins not with GLEIF but with the entity’s own top-level representatives. Tracing an OC (Organizational Credential) back to an LEI simply references from which entity authority is derived, whose authority to exist comes from the state or province of registration, not from a third party like GLEIF who looks at the official government registry after registration has already occurred.</p><p>(Going forward, for simplicity we will refer only to the LEI, though other proxy or official identifiers may be used. Learn more about the unique short history of GLEIF and current LEI adoption in a separate post,&nbsp;<a href="https://rufftimo.medium.com/the-unique-short-history-of-the-lei-3af37b39ad69">here</a>.)</p> Unique Identifiers for Representatives  Who is&nbsp;It? <p>Now that we’ve identified the legal entity, we must also uniquely identify its vessels of authority: its representatives. These are the people (and things) authorized to represent the organization in interactions and transactions with others, such as entering into a contract, authorizing a payment, servicing a customer or constituent, declaring goods and services, and&nbsp;more.</p> How Unique? <p>Unique identifiers for representatives can be as simple as a name (e.g., “Steve Smith”) or as sophisticated as a digital identity number or code conferred under legal terms by government: eIDAS certificates in Europe, SingPass in Singapore, Aadhaar card in India, ICN or Identificação Civil Nacional in Brazil, and many&nbsp;more.</p><p>“Unique” is relative to what an organization requires. A person’s given name is a semi-unique identifier meant initially to be unique only within a family, and is usually unique enough within small companies. Uniqueness is also achieved with combinations of identifiers like name and number, name and title, multiple numbers, etc. ‘Unique’ may also have a time constraint: what is unique today might not have been in the past or will be in the future, a trait called “unambiguous”, which may or may not be required depending on the use&nbsp;case.</p><p>When the authorized representative is an inanimate object or location, such as an AI bot or process on a server, the GLN, GTIN and other identifiers from the GS1 family of identifiers have no equal. GS1 is the originator and global administrator of <a href="https://www.gs1.org/standards/barcodes">bar codes</a>, used to uniquely identify products worldwide. Over 2 million companies utilize GS1 Standards and 100 million products carry GS1 barcodes. When combined with the verifiable LEI or “vLEI”, GS1 identifiers could form a powerful global root of trust for cryptographically verifying both the provenance and authority of any person or thing representing or produced by an organization.</p> Identifiers Don’t Prove&nbsp;Anything <p>Identifiers are not ‘authenticators’ or ‘authorizers’, they’re just alphanumeric strings. Unique identifiers tell you precisely who or what someone or something claims to be, but alone provide no way to verify the authenticity of the claim. A hierarchical chain of identifiers is also no more verifiable than a lone identifier, though it does provide more information: a claim of a relationship between&nbsp;them.</p><p>Alone, the LEI and GLN are identifiers like Social Security Numbers, birthdays, or any other number that can be easily written onto a piece of paper: they must be verified separately and manually (when they must be verified at all, which is not always the case in physical&nbsp;space).</p> Binding People to&nbsp;Entities <p>Many governments globally provide strong identity binding for citizens with unique ID cards equipped with a RFI-ready chip. This way a natural person could prove his/her identity across many boundaries, but they cannot prove authority; national ID cards do not convey any bindings between entities and their representatives. For example, you could prove that Steve Smith is Steve Smith, but not that he works for ACME Inc. or that he’s the CFO, authorized to sign financial statements on behalf of the organization.</p><p>An easily verifiable binding between actor, action, and authority is a serious need for many use cases in physical space, but a critical need in cyberspace for B2B and B2C interactions if we want to end the too-easy impersonation of organizational representatives by fraudsters who steal billions annually. We also need to speed up or eliminate innumerable tedious verification processes that cost significant time and&nbsp;money.</p> What If… <p>What if people acting on behalf of an organization could instantly prove it? What if software or devices or equipment deployed by an organization could reliably prove their provenance, to undoubtedly signify from where they derive their claimed authority?</p><p>(continued in <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/the-dawn-of-decentralized-organizational-identity-part-2-organizational-credentials-d8baf5fd9114">The Dawn of Decentralized Organizational Identity, Part 2: Organizational Credentials</a>)</p>

(after the
<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/meta-mulls-a-twitter-competitor-codenamed-p92-that-will-be-interoperable-with-mastodon-10223961.html">first one</a>
back in March) that Meta is building a “text-based social app” for “creators and
public figures”, variously code-named P92, Barcelona, or “Instagram for your thoughts”
and which “could comes as soon as June”.</p>
<p>Why the nervous excitement? Because both leaks state it “will be compatible with
some other apps like Mastodon”.</p>
<p>Many commentators have jumped to the conclusion that Meta will implement ActivityPub
and participate in the Fediverse just like other ActivityPub-enabled app (even if it
might bring ads or such). I believe this conclusion is wrong.</p>
<p>Meta is much more likely to use this “compatibility” story as:</p>
 
 
<p>a public relations / positioning coup to create good vibes for the new app among
important thought leaders (it’s already working, see above!); and</p>
 
 
<p>to present itself as the good guy in its fight with Twitter, which is the real target
here.</p>
 
 
<p>Use it as an avenue to siphon of current (and prospective) Fediverse users into their
own app.</p>
 
 
<p>Let’s see what the evidence there is for my belief. I’m working mostly off the more recent
“primary” leak source <a href="https://liahaberman.substack.com/p/icymi-instagrams-new-app-could-be?">here</a>:</p>
 
 
<p>Last week’s leak does not say “will implement ActivityPub”. The term “ActivityPub” does not
appear at all. (The March leak does have the term, but it is unattributed and the Meta
spokesperson they quote does not mention it.)</p>
 
 
<p>The leak does not say “Meta will implement one (or more) standard protocols for
connecting social applications”. There is nothing about favoring a standards-based
approach in the leak, and certainly not a commitment to it, like they would have for
other standards in other areas.</p>
 
 
<p>The leak says “Will be compatible with some other apps like Mastodon”. Carefully
parse this, specifically:</p>
 
 It does not say how it will be compatible. It could be, for example, by using
the Mastodon-specific client API, or a combination of client and server/ActivityPub
API. That might be helpful to Mastodon (maybe?) but not the rest of the Fediverse. 
 It gives no hint as to what they mean by “compatible”. If you think nicely working,
bidirectional exchange of social media posts with everybody in the Fediverse you
are jumping to a conclusion that is not backed by what has been said. 
 Why do they say “compatible with some other apps like Mastodon”, instead of
“compatible with all other apps speaking ActivityPub”? This sounds far more
selective, and subject to bilateral business agreements, than “any app that
speaks the standard”. 
 
 
 
<p>And then there is this: “Users on other apps will be able search for, follow and interact
with your profile and content [on the Meta app]”. Were you looking for the inverse:
“Users on the Meta app will be able to search for, follow and interact with any
Fediverse profile?” Because it’s not there. Indeed it would have been much simpler
to say “Users in all compatible apps will be able to …” but they don’t say that.</p>
 
 
<p>This latter point is important: On Facebook, famously, you can post links “out” to any
web page on the internet. However, you cannot link “in” from any page on the internet
to an arbitrary Facebook post. Unlike other social networks like Twitter, Facebook
is very asymmetric.</p>
<p>Facebook/Meta has a history of asymmetric implementations of what everybody would
otherwise think are and should be symmetrical systems. This very much reads to me
like Fediverse users can follow Meta users, but Meta users cannot follow Fediverse
users. If they do this, it would wreck the value proposition of the Fediverse, I would think.</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>Now these are all leaks, and as such, we should have very limited confidence in
their truth, accuracy and completeness, and the accuracy of any analysis based on them
such as mine. The proof will be in the app when they
release it.</p>
<p>But: in the meantime, we should be asking ourselves the question: what if Meta
does not play a fair game here? What if they implement things to favor themselves
to the detriment of everybody else, such a asymmetric implementations, all under
the guys of playing nice with open-source apps such as Mastodon? Certainly
that’s what we should expect based on their behavior in the past.</p>

 What is “digital identity”&nbsp;? <p>It’s probably more than you&nbsp;think.</p>What is “digital identity” by Adrian&nbsp;Doerk<p>The term “digital identity” is used to describe a multitude of different concepts. This article provides a comprehensive overview of how different actors use the term and highlights aspects, which are relevant for an individual’s perspective.</p> It depends on the&nbsp;context! <p>The meaning of the term “digital identity” greatly depends on the context it is used in. In the following I will provide you with seven perspectives of how different stakeholders use the&nbsp;term.</p>Image source: <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-digital-identity_en">European Commission</a><p>Government stakeholders, but also regulated companies, which use or offer identification processes (“KYC — Know your customer”) primarily use the term to refer to the real world identity of a person. Mostly this is a credential issued by a government authority to a citizen, such as a passport, ID-card or driver licence. The credential contains a set of attributes describing and differentiating a person from another enabling the identification of a natural&nbsp;person.</p><p>The identification of a person in an online scenario highly depends on the eID-system, but uses a minimum of two authentication factors:</p><p>Inheritance (biometrics): Auto-ident or similar procedures and liveness checks aided by facial recognition<br>Knowledge: PIN, passwords or one-time factors (SMS) etc.<br>Ownership: Smart-cards (e.g. the eID-card) or secure elements on smartphones</p><p>While some governments recognise that digital identity is more than this single credential, the mental model is very much limited to attributes / credentials in&nbsp;general.</p>Image source:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6046815?hl=en">Google</a><p>Private sector companies and the traditional identity and access management (IAM) sector use the term to refer to user accounts under control of a single entity. Hence, the identity is an entry within a proprietary database (active directory) of an organisation, which grants identity subjects (customers or employees) rights to perform certain actions within the domain of the organisation.</p><p>This is a very limited perspective of a digital identity, which is only valid in the domain of the organisation in question. Every internet user has multiple different user accounts at different organisations, creating a fractured identity landscape for individuals and companies alike. Access to these user accounts is mostly enabled via email and password, single sign-on solutions by big-tech (“Sing-in with google”) or other approaches without password.</p>Image source:&nbsp;<a href="https://cheqd.io/web-3.0-and-digital-identity">cheqd.io</a><p>The WEB 3.0 community primarily uses the term to refer to user accounts, reputation systems, credentials and assets. The community frequently uses the term “decentralised identity” or “WEB3 identity” to describe their approach and differentiate it to government issued “real world” identities. WEB3 solutions differentiate their solutions by using distributed ledgers (blockchains) with public read and write access as a single source of truth. By using a shared infrastructure, WEB3 solutions aim to avoid centralised and proprietary systems.</p><p>When accessing WEB3 identity solutions it’s crucial to differentiate between on- and off-chain identities. On-chain identities are written directly to the ledger and therefore are public by default. Once written to the ledger they can’t be deleted, only declared invalid. These on-chain identities should be handled with great care when dealing with personal identifiable information. Examples are NFTs, Soulbound Tokens (SBT) and the Ethereum Name Systems&nbsp;(ENS).</p><p>This is in strong contrast to off-chain identities, for which only the public keys of issuers and other metadata is written to the public ledger. Examples include verifiable credentials and some zero-knowledge proof implementations.</p>Image source:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/09/26/self-sovereign-identity-taking-control-over-your-digital-identity/">Forbes</a><p>The Self-Sovereign identity (SSI) community uses the term for a variety of perspectives, but focuses on user accounts, credentialing and relationships as well as governance of identity frameworks. These frameworks aim to provide a foundation for digital trust — not only in cryptography, but also in humans, organisations and processes. The community sees SSI as a concept, which provides principles as a guideline to ensure an identity ecosystem in which the individual is empowered and protected. The solutions aim to provide a holistic answer, which is not only user-centric, but also enables people to assert control over their relationships / user accounts.</p><p>The community exclusively uses verifiable credentials in combination with decentralised identifiers controlled by the user from within a digital wallet. SSI integrations do work with centralised and decentralised public key infrastructure. Currently, most integration leverage distributed ledgers with permissioned writing and public reading rights to ensure regulatory compliance.</p>Image source: <a href="https://cybelangel.com/digital-identity-theft-is-within-everyones-reach-on-the-dark-web/">cybelangel.com</a><p>Service providers specialised in identity fraud prevention use the term to refer to the personal data of a person offered by data brokers or databases in the darknet. The data itself can range from email addresses and passwords to income level, postal addresses, credit card information or other behavioural and sensitive personal data. In the majority of cases this personal data is collected and distributed without consent of the person, or even worse without any kind of knowledge or control by the affected person nor watchdogs or governments. According to <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">haveibeenpwned.com</a> 12,485,202,808 user accounts (incl. Email and phone numbers) have been exposed to the darknet in March&nbsp;2023.</p>Image source:&nbsp;D<a href="https://www.deloitte.com/global/en/services/risk-advisory/perspectives/the-future-of-digital-identity.html">eloitte</a><p>Consulting companies see digital identity as a foundation to increase efficiency of business processes for organisations. Hence, they combine different perspectives, but focus on the needs of an organisation. Furthermore, they differentiate between organisational identities and personal identities, with the latter being a customer of a business, or a citizen of a&nbsp;country.</p>Image Source: <a href="https://www.hartware.de/2019/12/24/how-to-protect-your-digital-identity-with-vpn-for-windows/">hartware.de</a><p>Advertisement companies and virtual private network (VPN) providers see a digital identity as behavioural data of individuals. While advertisement companies aim to collect vast amounts of behavioural data of individuals, VPN providers try to help individuals to reduce this collection.</p><p>It’s noteworthy that not all behavioural data is directly connected to individuals. Some analytics and advertisement providers anonymise behavioural data to a certain extent with cohort models. These models group users who share common characteristics and behaviours in known cohorts to facilitate effective targeted campaigns for advertisers.</p> Mental Models: Providing a mental framework for different perspectives: <p>The following five mental models describe what people refer to, when speaking about identity and provide a useful structure of how these models can be executed in a digital environment. The five mental models were published by <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot7-toronto/blob/master/final-documents/mental-models.md">experts of the RWOT community</a> and are quoted within this paragraph.</p>Image Source: Adrian&nbsp;Doerk<p>Space-time: sees identity as resolving the question of physical continuity of an entity through space and time, answering if the physical body under evaluation has a continuous link through space and time to a known&nbsp;entity.</p><p>Presentation: sees identity as how we present ourselves to society, answering if this is how the subject chooses to be&nbsp;known.</p><p>Attribute: sees identity as the set of attributes related to an entity recorded in a specific system, answering who this data is&nbsp;about.</p><p>Relationship: sees identity emerging through interactions and relationships with others, answering how this person is&nbsp;related.</p><p>Capability: pragmatically defines identity in terms of an individual’s capability to perform some task, answering what the subject can actually&nbsp;do.</p> Overview of aspects of a digital&nbsp;identity Image source: Adrian Doerk, What is “digital identity”?<p>As illustrated in the graphic above, an individual’s digital identity comprises countless aspects from different categories. This includes public services provided by governments, regions or cities, which in most cases require the identification of a person. Identification is also required for some financial services and activities as well as a limited set of activities in the professional, educational, health, travel, home and family categories. Nevertheless, the vast majority of activities in the private sector currently don’t require the identification of a person. The categories data, communication and organisation do not contain any activities for which an identification is required.</p><p>Another notable distinction is the frequency of usage within certain categories. While we use tools for the communication and organisation of data as well as social activities on a daily basis, we rather rarely use public services.</p> Should we stop using the term “digital identity”? <p>No, however we need to be aware that other people might have a totally different understanding of what it means. Using the term “digital identity” exclusively for a limited sub-set of the above mentioned aspects isn’t wrong, but it neglects crucial parts of being a human. This is especially true for using the term solely for the identification process of a person using a government issued identity credential.</p> About the&nbsp;author: <p>Adrian Doerk focuses on providing user-centric digital identity services with digital wallets, which ensure privacy and empowerment of the individual.
