<p>I appreciated <a href="https://avc.com/2020/09/universal-access-and-choice/">Fred Wilson's post today about USV's thesis on expanding access to knowledge, wellness, and capital</a>. He also talks about universal basic income as a way to get there. It's a useful lens to think about the future, although perhaps inevitably, I see it a slightly different way.</p><p>Despite being a natural born American citizen, I grew up in a European context, went to state schools, and went to university for free. (I was actually part of the last cohort of university students to do so; the year afterwards, universities started to charge a whopping £1300 per year, except in Scotland.) I understand that free college does not entrench existing income disparities; my fellow students came from a very broad range of backgrounds and contexts.</p><p>Coming from that context, I don't see government services as monopolies in the business sense. They're services in the civil sense: social infrastructure for all. For example, I'm not sure we would want to have multiple police forces competing for business in a capitalist market (however we feel about our current ones). Or take healthcare: every time I walk into a doctor's office in the US I miss the simplicity and safety of the NHS.</p><p>So I go the other way. I strongly believe that private schools shouldn't exist, which is an alien idea to some. Every child should have the same opportunities. Every college should be free. Private schools, and private colleges, entrench existing power networks. Why shouldn't a kid who happened to be born poor, or in the wrong neighborhood, have access to them? It's not like rich people don't have a thousand other ways to convey privilege to their offspring - but at least access to the same institutions would give everyone else a fighting chance.</p><p><a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/education-k-12/reports/2017/07/12/435629/racist-origins-private-school-vouchers/">"School choice" has a racist history</a>, and <a href="https://hechingerreport.org/reformers-must-stop-whitewashing-choice/">a racist present</a>. It's not something we should knowingly advocate for without understanding and actively fighting to undermine its foundation in segregation.</p><p>Similarly, universal basic income that doesn't sit alongside other mechanisms for economic justice and support is just a way to undermine those kinds of programs. It's not either/or: all schools should be free and everyone should have access to a basic income. College should be available to all and a monthly stipend would have great ROI for the economy. We don't get to absolve ourselves of providing opportunities throughout society by simply cutting a check. In a vacuum, UBI is that most American idea: discrimination in the guise of equity.</p><p>With state support, we will still have a great market economy: one where everyone can start a business or participate in one. In fact, it'll be better, because more people will have access to networks and training. Providing social infrastructure isn't an anti-capitalist idea; it's an anti-racist, anti-discrimination one. It allows more people to access the resources they need to participate, rather than disproportionately shutting out people of color and people from poorer backgrounds. And if you don't think that's where we should be heading, I'm not sure we have much to say to each other.</p>

<p>Email newsletters are only succeeding because RSS failed.</p><p>I just subscribed to Casey Newton's new tech journalism newsletter, <a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/welcome-to-platformer">Platformer</a>. I appreciate his journalism, and I'm sure it'll become a regular must-read for me in the same way that <a href="https://stratechery.com/">Ben Thompson's Stratechery</a> is. The tech industry needs more analytical journalism, and I'm pleased to support it.</p><p>There's an interesting platform difference between the two. When you sign up and pay for Stratechery, you can certainly opt in to receiving daily emails - and I'm sure this is how most of his subscribers read his work. But you can also get access to a private RSS feed that you can plug into your reader.</p><p>My feed reader is an important part of my morning routine, but it also serves another purpose: to keep regular subscription content out of my inbox. I have enough trouble keeping on top of my email; I'm terrible at it. Adding more messages will not help me. But I also really want to subscribe! So having all my regular subscription content in one place, away from the desolation of my inbox, is useful. (Hundreds of you are reading this post in your inbox. I'm assuming you're all better at email than me! If not, you can always subscribe to my blog via a feed reader.)</p><p>In contrast to Stratechery, Platformer uses <a href="https://substack.com/">Substack</a>, which has made starting and subscribing to paid newsletters incredibly easy. As a subscriber, I plug in my email, hit the Apple Pay button, and I'm subscribed. It's kind of a brilliant way to support independent writers. Like RSS feeds, authors don't need to rely on social media for distribution; they have a more direct relationship with the reader. Unlike RSS feeds, it all piles into my horror show inbox.</p><p>My feed reader of choice is <a href="https://newsblur.com/">NewsBlur</a> (together with the beautiful <a href="https://reederapp.com/">Reeder</a> apps), in part because it allows me to forward email newsletters to an address it provides. <a href="https://feedbin.com/">Feedbin</a> and a few others do this too. I have a blanket filter that removes every Substack newsletter from my inbox and sends the messages to my feed reader, where they show up alongside the blogs I subscribe to. It works for me: I get to read all of my subscriptions in one place, and leave my inbox for all of those other messages that I'll get to eventually.</p><p>It's worth imagining another world, where the string and blu tack solution I made for myself is easy for everyone. What if everyone had an easy-to-use place to read their subscription content, away from the hustle and bustle of their regular emails? What if feed subscriptions had become mainstream, and payments had become an integral part of the specification? What if every author had the ability to use the platform that Ben Thompson had to build for himself, allowing each of them to make a living from their work as easily as publishing to the web?</p><p>The technology isn't there right now, but could it be?</p><p>Every journalist, artist, app builder, musician, author, podcaster, etc, should be able to make money independently on the web. And the web should help them do that.</p><p>Of course, RSS feeds haven't failed. The entire podcasting ecosystem heavily depends on them - <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/podcast-market">an $11 billion market</a>, all depending on open feeds. Even for written content, there are millions of people like me who use them every day. People in tech love to talk about <a href="https://killedbygoogle.com/">the death of Google Reader</a>, but nobody killed RSS.</p><p>For a year, I worked with Julien Genestoux, who had previously built the <a href="https://superfeedr.com/">Superfeedr</a> feed subscription and distribution engine, on <a href="https://unlock-protocol.com/">Unlock</a>, a protocol for independent, decentralized payments on the web. The startup didn't quite work out, but the open source protocol continues to find use. Most importantly, I think the idea (anyone should be able to take payments from their own website without a middleman) is very strong, even if the Ethereum blockchain it depended on turned out to not quite be ready for primetime. Not to mention the ability for payments to supplant <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/08/advertising-is-the-internets-original-sin/376041/">harmful targeted advertising</a>.</p><p>I believe that Substack, the Stratechery platform, and Patreon's subscription model are all evidence of a need for a decentralized marketplace of content, monetized through easy, recurring payments that don't require a content silo. By using the same feed ecosystem that powers the whole podcasting ecosystem (and my morning content routine), adding a payments layer on top of the RSS specification itself, and then making it insanely easy to read and subscribe, we could empower a new generation of creators, readers, and reader apps.</p><p>Some technical work has been done. <a href="https://about.radiopublic.com/2019/08/09/podpass-proposal-for-an-open-protocol-to-enable-direct-listener-relationships/">PodPass</a> is a proposal for an identity layer on top of RSS for podcasts. <a href="https://www.w3.org/Payments/WG/">Work is being done at the W3C on web payments</a>. Identity and payment mechanisms are both crucial parts of providing subscriptions as a first-class layer on the web. But there's a great deal more to do technically - and a huge amount more in terms of building a coherent user experience, particularly around payments.</p><p>Here's my final "what if". What if subscription payments were built into the browser or reader, with the vendor itself taking a small cut (in the same way that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2014/09/12/more-apple-pay-details/">Apple takes 0.15% of Apple Pay purchases</a>)?</p><p>For example: let's say I browse to a website using Mozilla Firefox. That website has some metadata in its HTML which indicates that (1) a feed is available, and (2) there are payment tiers.</p><p>Firefox lets me know that I can subscribe to that website's content with an unobtrusive icon or notification. When I click, it shows me the tiers available. When I hit subscribe, Firefox starts to pull feed content in a built-in reader. When it pulls feeds, it identifies me in the HTTP header with a pseudonymous hash code. For the purposes of this conversation, I'm user <code>123456</code> (the same combination I have on my luggage).</p><p>When I pay, funds are sent directly to the website owner, with a small cut going to Mozilla itself, and another small cut going to WordPress, which powers the site. Funds are transferred behind the scenes in stablecoins (probably), with Mozilla providing a credit card interface to me so I don't have to know or care about crypto. It tells the website owner that I'm user <code>123456</code>, and that I've paid. The website verifies the payment, and next time a feed is requested for user <code>123456</code>, it adds in any paid content. Unlock did this provably, using the blockchain: anyone can build an API which verifies independently that user A has access to paid content from user B.</p><p>From the user's perspective it looks like this: they can see that a website they're on has content that can be subscribed to. When they hit "subscribe" in the browser, they're prompted to choose a tier if paid tiers exist. And then they can read content and manage their subscriptions in a built-in reader.</p><p>For users like me, my existing feed reader can do the same thing: detect paid options, and pay for them if I want. The feed reader vendor gets the cut of the funds.</p><p>Cross-device syncing is taken care of by the browser vendor: my Firefox account already keeps my bookmarks and history up to date everywhere I have Firefox installed. Chrome and Safari users have a similar mechanism. Subscriptions would piggyback on these existing accounts.</p><p>The end result is a web where any creator can make money from their content and any reader can subscribe to it, without having it further clutter an email inbox that they already resent. Because browsers, feed readers, and content management platforms take a small cut of payments, they're incentivized to innovate around the model and build new products. Browser vendors like Mozilla can stop <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/sources-mozilla-extends-its-google-search-deal/">making most of their money from search engine deals</a>. Nobody is forced to rely on Facebook or Twitter for distribution. Targeted ads die. And the internet is more decentralized and healthier for everyone.</p>

  <p>Yesterday <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Sep/23/sqlite-advanced-alter-table/">I described</a> the new <a href="https://sqlite-utils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cli.html#transforming-tables">sqlite-utils transform</a> mechanism for applying SQLite table transformations that go beyond those supported by <code>ALTER TABLE</code>.

 The problem 
<p>Much of the data I work with in Datasette starts off as a CSV file published by an organization or government. Since CSV files aren’t relational databases, they are often denormalized. It’s particularly common to see something like this:</p>

<p>This is an extract from the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?channel=cus2&amp;client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;q=datassf+employee+salaries">San Francisco Employee Compensation</a> dataset from DataSF.</p>
<p>The <code>sqlite-utils extract</code> command-line tool, and the <code>table.extract()</code> Python method that underlies it, can be used to extract these duplicated column pairs out into separate tables with foreign key relationships from the main table.</p>
 How to refactor that data 
<p>Here's how to use <code>sqlite-utils</code> to clean up and refactor that compensation data.</p>
<p>First, grab the data. It's a 150M CSV file containing over 600,000 rows:</p>
 <code>curl -o salaries.csv 'https://data.sfgov.org/api/views/88g8-5mnd/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD'
</code> 
<p>Use <code>sqlite-utils insert</code> to load that into a SQLite database:</p>
 <code>sqlite-utils insert salaries.db salaries salaries.csv --csv
</code> 
<p>Fire up Datasette to check that the data looks right:</p>
 <code>datasette salaries.db
</code> 
<p>There's a catch here: the schema for the generated table (shown at the bottom of <code>http://localhost:8001/salaries/salaries</code>) reveals that because we imported from CSV every column is a text column. Since some of this data is numeric we should convert to numbers, so we can do things like sort the table by the highest salary.</p>
<p>We can do that using <code>sqlite-transform</code>:</p>
 <code>sqlite-utils transform salaries.db salaries \
  --type 'Employee Identifier' integer \
  --type Salaries float \
  --type Overtime float \
  --type 'Other Salaries' float \
  --type 'Total Salary' float \
  --type 'Retirement' float \
  --type 'Health and Dental' float \
  --type 'Other Benefits' float \
  --type 'Total Benefits' float \
  --type 'Total Compensation' float
</code> 
<p>Having run that command, here's the new database schema:</p>
 <code>$ sqlite3 salaries.db '.schema salaries'
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "salaries" (
   [rowid] INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
   [Year Type] TEXT,
   [Year] TEXT,
   [Organization Group Code] TEXT,
   [Organization Group] TEXT,
   [Department Code] TEXT,
   [Department] TEXT,
   [Union Code] TEXT,
   [Union] TEXT,
   [Job Family Code] TEXT,
   [Job Family] TEXT,
   [Job Code] TEXT,
   [Job] TEXT,
   [Employee Identifier] INTEGER,
   [Salaries] FLOAT,
   [Overtime] FLOAT,
   [Other Salaries] FLOAT,
   [Total Salary] FLOAT,
   [Retirement] FLOAT,
   [Health and Dental] FLOAT,
   [Other Benefits] FLOAT,
   [Total Benefits] FLOAT,
   [Total Compensation] FLOAT
);
</code> 
<p>Now we can start extracting those columns. We do this using several rounds of the <code>sqlite-utils extract</code> command, one for each duplicated pairs.</p>
<p>For <code>Organization Group Code</code> and <code>Organization Group</code>:</p>
 <code>sqlite-utils extract salaries.db salaries \
   'Organization Group Code' 'Organization Group' \
  --table 'organization_groups' \
  --fk-column 'organization_group_id' \
  --rename 'Organization Group Code' code \
  --rename 'Organization Group' name
</code> 
<p>This took about 12 minutes on my laptop, and displayed a progress bar as it runs. (UPDATE: <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils/issues/172">in issue #172</a> I improved the performance and knocked it down to just 4 seconds. I also removed the progress bar).</p>
<p>Here's the refactored database schema:</p>
 <code>$ sqlite3 salaries.db .schema
CREATE TABLE [organization_groups] (
   [id] INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
   [code] TEXT,
   [name] TEXT
);
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "salaries" (
   [rowid] INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
   [Year Type] TEXT,
   [Year] TEXT,
   [organization_group_id] INTEGER,
   [Department Code] TEXT,
   [Department] TEXT,
   [Union Code] TEXT,
   [Union] TEXT,
   [Job Family Code] TEXT,
   [Job Family] TEXT,
   [Job Code] TEXT,
   [Job] TEXT,
   [Employee Identifier] INTEGER,
   [Salaries] FLOAT,
   [Overtime] FLOAT,
   [Other Salaries] FLOAT,
   [Total Salary] FLOAT,
   [Retirement] FLOAT,
   [Health and Dental] FLOAT,
   [Other Benefits] FLOAT,
   [Total Benefits] FLOAT,
   [Total Compensation] FLOAT,
   FOREIGN KEY(organization_group_id) REFERENCES organization_groups(id)
);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX [idx_organization_groups_code_name]
    ON [organization_groups] ([code], [name]);
</code> 
<p>Now fire up Datasette to confirm it had the desired effect:</p>
 <code>datasette salaries.db
</code> 
<p>Here's what that looks like:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Note that the new <code>organization_group_id</code> column still shows the name of the organization group, because Datasette automatically de-references foreign key relationships when it displays a table and uses any column called <code>name</code> (or <code>title</code> or <code>value</code>) as the label for a link to the record.</p>
<p>Let's extract the other columns. This will take a while:</p>
 <code>sqlite-utils extract salaries.db salaries \
   'Department Code' 'Department' \
  --table 'departments' \
  --fk-column 'department_id' \
  --rename 'Department Code' code \
  --rename 'Department' name

sqlite-utils extract salaries.db salaries \
   'Union Code' 'Union' \
  --table 'unions' \
  --fk-column 'union_id' \
  --rename 'Union Code' code \
  --rename 'Union' name

sqlite-utils extract salaries.db salaries \
   'Job Family Code' 'Job Family' \
  --table 'job_families' \
  --fk-column 'job_family_id' \
  --rename 'Job Family Code' code \
  --rename 'Job Family' name

sqlite-utils extract salaries.db salaries \
   'Job Code' 'Job' \
  --table 'jobs' \
  --fk-column 'job_id' \
  --rename 'Job Code' code \
  --rename 'Job' name
</code> 
<p>Our finished schema looks like this:</p>
 <code>$ sqlite3 salaries.db .schema
CREATE TABLE [organization_groups] (
   [id] INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
   [code] TEXT,
   [name] TEXT
);
CREATE TABLE [departments] (
   [id] INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
   [code] TEXT,
   [name] TEXT
);
CREATE TABLE [unions] (
   [id] INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
   [code] TEXT,
   [name] TEXT
);
CREATE TABLE [job_families] (
   [id] INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
   [code] TEXT,
   [name] TEXT
);
CREATE TABLE [jobs] (
   [id] INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
   [code] TEXT,
   [name] TEXT
);
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "salaries" (
   [rowid] INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
   [Year Type] TEXT,
   [Year] TEXT,
   [organization_group_id] INTEGER REFERENCES [organization_groups]([id]),
   [department_id] INTEGER REFERENCES [departments]([id]),
   [union_id] INTEGER REFERENCES [unions]([id]),
   [job_family_id] INTEGER REFERENCES [job_families]([id]),
   [job_id] INTEGER,
   [Employee Identifier] INTEGER,
   [Salaries] FLOAT,
   [Overtime] FLOAT,
   [Other Salaries] FLOAT,
   [Total Salary] FLOAT,
   [Retirement] FLOAT,
   [Health and Dental] FLOAT,
   [Other Benefits] FLOAT,
   [Total Benefits] FLOAT,
   [Total Compensation] FLOAT,
   FOREIGN KEY(job_id) REFERENCES jobs(id)
);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX [idx_organization_groups_code_name]
    ON [organization_groups] ([code], [name]);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX [idx_departments_code_name]
    ON [departments] ([code], [name]);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX [idx_unions_code_name]
    ON [unions] ([code], [name]);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX [idx_job_families_code_name]
    ON [job_families] ([code], [name]);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX [idx_jobs_code_name]
    ON [jobs] ([code], [name]);
</code> 
<p>We've also shrunk our database file quite a bit. Before the transformations <code>salaries.db</code> was 159MB. It's now just 70MB - that's less than half the size!</p>
<p>I used <code>datasette publish cloudrun</code> to publish a copy of my final database here:</p>
<p><a href="https://sf-employee-compensation.datasettes.com/salaries/salaries">https://sf-employee-compensation.datasettes.com/salaries/salaries</a></p>
<p>Here's the command I used to publish it:</p>
 <code>datasette publish cloudrun salaries.db \
  --service sf-employee-compensation \
  --title "San Francisco Employee Compensation (as-of 21 Sep 2020)" \
  --source "DataSF" \
  --source_url "https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Employee-Compensation/88g8-5mnd" \
  --about "About this project" \
  --about_url "https://simonwillison.net/2020/Sep/23/sqlite-utils-extract/" \
  --install datasette-block-robots \
  --install datasette-vega \
  --install datasette-copyable \
  --install datasette-graphql
</code> 
 Bonus: explore salaries with GraphQL 
<p>You may have noticed my <code>datasette publish</code> line above finished with the line <code>--install datasette-graphql</code>. This installs the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql">datasette-graphql</a> plugin as part of the deployment to Cloud Run. Which means we can query the salary data using GraphQL as an alternative to SQL!</p>
<p>Here's a GraphQL query that shows the ten highest paid employees, including their various expanded foreign key references:</p>
  {
  salaries(sort_desc: Total_Compensation, first: 10) {
    nodes {
      Year_Type

   SQLite's ALTER TABLE has some significant limitations: it can't drop columns, it can't alter NOT NULL status, it can't change column types. Since I spend a lot of time with SQLite these days I've written some code to fix this - both from Python and as a command-line utility. 
 To SQLite's credit, not only are these limitations well explained in the documentation but the explanation is accompanied

  <p>SQLite's ALTER TABLE has some significant limitations: it can't drop columns, it can't alter NOT NULL status, it can't change column types. Since I spend a lot of time with SQLite these days I've written some code to fix this - both from Python and as a command-line utility.</p>
<p>To SQLite's credit, not only are these limitations <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/lang_altertable.html">well explained</a> in the documentation but the explanation is accompanied by <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/lang_altertable.html#making_other_kinds_of_table_schema_changes">a detailed description</a> of the recommended workaround. The short version looks something like this:</p>
 
 Start a transaction 
 Create a new temporary table with the exact shape you would like 
 Copy all of your old data across using INSERT INTO temp_table SELECT FROM old_table 
 Drop the old table 
 Rename the temp table to the old table 
 Commit the transaction 
 
<p>My <a href="https://sqlite-utils.readthedocs.io/">sqlite-utils</a> tool and Python library aims to make working with SQLite as convenient as possible. So I set out to build a utility method for performing this kind of large scale table transformation. I've called it <code>table.transform(...)</code>.</p>
<p>Here are some simple examples of what it can do, lifted from <a href="https://sqlite-utils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/python-api.html#python-api-transform">the documentation</a>:</p>
 # Convert the 'age' column to an integer, and 'weight' to a float
table.transform(types={"age": int, "weight": float})

# Rename the 'age' column to 'initial_age':
table.transform(rename={"age": "initial_age"})

# Drop the 'age' column:
table.transform(drop={"age"})

# Make `user_id` the new primary key
table.transform(pk="user_id")

# Make the 'age' and 'weight' columns NOT NULL
table.transform(not_null={"age", "weight"})

# Make age allow NULL and switch weight to being NOT NULL:
table.transform(not_null={"age": False, "weight": True})

# Set default age to 1:
table.transform(defaults={"age": 1})

# Now remove the default from that column:
table.transform(defaults={"age": None}) 
<p>Each time the <code>table.transform(...)</code> method runs it will create a brand new table, copy the data across and then drop the old table. You can combine multiple operations together in a single call, avoiding copying the table multiple times.</p>
<p>The <code>table.transform_sql(...)</code> method returns the SQL that would be executed instead of executing it directly, useful if you want to handle even more complex requirements.</p>
 The "sqlite-utils transform" command-line tool 
<p>Almost every feature in <code>sqlite-utils</code> is available in both the Python library and as a command-line utility, and <code>.transform()</code> is no exception. The <code>sqlite-utils transform</code> command can be used to apply complex table transformations directly from the command-line.</p>
<p>Here's an example, starting with the <a href="https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures">fixtures.db</a> database that powers Datasette's unit tests:</p>
 <code>$ wget https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures.db
$ sqlite3 fixtures.db '.schema facetable'
CREATE TABLE facetable (
    pk integer primary key,
    created text,
    planet_int integer,
    on_earth integer,
    state text,
    city_id integer,
    neighborhood text,
    tags text,
    complex_array text,
    distinct_some_null,
    FOREIGN KEY ("city_id") REFERENCES [facet_cities](id)
);
$ sqlite-utils transform fixtures.db facetable \
  --type on_earth text \
  --drop complex_array \
  --drop state \
  --rename tags the_tags
$ sqlite3 fixtures.db '.schema facetable'       
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "facetable" (
   [pk] INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
   [created] TEXT,
   [planet_int] INTEGER,
   [on_earth] TEXT,
   [city_id] INTEGER REFERENCES [facet_cities]([id]),
   [neighborhood] TEXT,
   [the_tags] TEXT,
   [distinct_some_null] TEXT
);
</code> 
<p>You can use the <code>--sql</code> option to see the SQL that would be executed without actually running it:</p>
 <code>$ wget https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures.db
$ sqlite-utils transform fixtures.db facetable \
  --type on_earth text \
  --drop complex_array \
  --drop state \
  --rename tags the_tags \
  --sql
CREATE TABLE [facetable_new_442f07e26eef] (
   [pk] INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
   [created] TEXT,
   [planet_int] INTEGER,
   [on_earth] TEXT,
   [city_id] INTEGER REFERENCES [facet_cities]([id]),
   [neighborhood] TEXT,
   [the_tags] TEXT,
   [distinct_some_null] TEXT
);
INSERT INTO [facetable_new_442f07e26eef] ([pk], [created], [planet_int], [on_earth], [city_id], [neighborhood], [the_tags], [distinct_some_null])
   SELECT [pk], [created], [planet_int], [on_earth], [city_id], [neighborhood], [tags], [distinct_some_null] FROM [facetable];
DROP TABLE [facetable];
ALTER TABLE [facetable_new_442f07e26eef] RENAME TO [facetable];
</code> 
 Plenty more tricks 
<p><code>sqlite-utils</code> has plenty more tricks up its sleeve. I suggest spending some time browsing the <a href="https://sqlite-utils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/python-api.html">Python library reference</a> and the <a href="https://sqlite-utils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cli.html">sqlite-utils CLI documentation</a>, or taking a look through through the <a href="https://sqlite-utils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changelog.html">release notes</a>.</p>

Atlanta Innovation Forum Live Event



 Program Abstract 



<p>Keeping Pace with the Explosion of Online Traffic… and the Surge of Online Threats Technology has always moved at an accelerating pace. But, since the start of the global pandemic, Internet usage has exploded at a never-before-seen pace, creating an equally explosive opportunity for cybercrime and online security risks. </p>



<p>In 2020: </p>



  Internet traffic has increased by 70% this year; streaming has increased by more than 12%  Ecommerce during the first six months increased more than 30% over online sales from the same time period last year (compared to the previous year to year same period growth of 13%)  Ecommerce sales for June 2020 were up 76% over June 2019 sales; for July 2020, they were up 56% from July 2019   10% of shoppers are making an online purchase for the first time this year, due to social distancing concerns  



<p>The increase is great news for Internet retailers and online service providers. But, it’s also a great opportunity for online criminals. It’s estimated that online crime in 2020 could result in over $6 trillion in losses this year. So what’s being done to address this? What steps are being taken to make online use by businesses and consumers more secure, to keep pace for with the bad guys? What new tech is being employed? How are businesses and technology vendors – many who are competitors – working together to protect their consumer and business customers to reduce losses, protect privacy and confidential data and to keep the ever-smarter bad guys from getting ahead? Join us as a panel of experts from B2B, B2C, Security and InfoSec explore what “high tech” is doing to thwart “high crime”</p>



 My Contribution  



<p>For my part, I’m going to speak about The Identity Nexus. The Identity Nexus is the elusive equilibrium point where mutual and equitable personal information value exchange between people, public, and private institutions can be had. I’ll discuss the <a href="https://identitypraxis.com/2020/08/26/iapp-releases-us-state-comprehensive-privacy-law-comparison-why-this-is-relevant-to-the-identity-nexus/">trinity of self-sovereignty</a> (Privacy, Security, Compliance) and the solutions needed to help us all thrive in the emerging personal information economy.</p>

<p>Katherine Eban, in a <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/09/jared-kushner-let-the-markets-decide-covid-19-fate" title="“That’s Their Problem”: How Jared Kushner Let the Markets Decide America’s COVID-19 Fate">deeply reported piece</a>, for Vanity Faire:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Those representing the private sector expected to learn about a sweeping
government plan to procure supplies and direct them to the places they were
needed most. New York, home to more than a third of the nation’s coronavirus
cases, seemed like an obvious candidate. In turn they came armed with specific
commitments of support, a memo on the merits of the Defense Production Act, a
document outlining impediments to the private-sector response, and two key
questions: How could they best help? And how could they best support the
government’s strategy?</p>
<p>According to one attendee, Kushner then began to rail against the governor:
“Cuomo didn’t pound the phones hard enough to get PPE for his state…. His
people are going to suffer and that’s their problem.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But wait, it gets worse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kushner, seated at the head of the conference table, in a chair taller than
all the others, was quick to strike a confrontational tone. “The federal
government is not going to lead this response,” he announced. “It’s up to the
states to figure out what they want to do.”</p>
<p>One attendee explained to Kushner that due to the finite supply of PPE,
Americans were bidding against each other and driving prices up. To solve
that, businesses eager to help were looking to the federal government for
leadership and direction.</p>
<p>“Free markets will solve this,” Kushner said dismissively. “That is not the
role of government.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seldom have falser words been spoken. These incompetents conflate their failure
to lead with their belief that the government cannot lead. The prophecy fulfills
itself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The same attendee explained that although he believed in open markets, he
feared that the system was breaking. As evidence, he pointed to a CNN report
about New York governor Andrew Cuomo and his desperate call for supplies.</p>
<p>“That’s the CNN bullshit,” Kushner snapped. “They lie.”</p>
<p>“That’s when I was like, We’re screwed,” the shocked attendee told Vanity

<p>This is a really interesting, relatively new database. It's kind of a weird hybrid between SQLite and PostgreSQL: it uses the PostgreSQL parser but models itself after SQLite in that databases are a single file and the code is designed for use as an embedded library, distributed in a single amalgamation C++ file (SQLite uses a C amalgamation). It features a "columnar-vectorized query execution engine" inspired by MonetDB (also by the DuckDB authors) and is hence designed to run analytical queries really quickly. You can install it using "pip install duckdb" - the resulting module feels similar to Python's sqlite3, and follows roughly the same DBAPI pattern.</p>

<p>I'm pretty conflicted about <a href="https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/">The Social Dilemma</a>.</p><p>On one hand, anything that contributes to the discourse around the harms knowingly committed in the name of engagement should be applauded. My friend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Jay">David Jay</a> works at the <a href="https://www.humanetech.com/">Center for Humane Technology</a> as their Head of Mobilization, and was involved in this film; I know the people who work there are coming from a genuine place. I think that is admirable.</p><p>On the other hand, I'll confess to some pretty hard reservations about <a href="https://conversationalist.org/2020/03/05/the-prodigal-techbro/">tech bros who make their fortune at companies like Facebook and then issue mea culpas</a>. The harmful impact of platforms like Facebook were knowable; I know because I, and people like me, knew them well. In 2004, when Facebook was just graduating from <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/04/11/channeling-the-social-network-lawmaker-grills-zuckerberg-on-his-notorious-beginnings/">being a way to rate the relative attractiveness of women on campus</a>, I was building decentralized social platforms with community health in mind. There were many people like me who understood that creating a centralized place controlled by a single corporate entity for most of the world would get their information was incredibly problematic. It was and is antithetical to both the web and democracy itself.</p><p>So coders have been working on these problems, but this isn't really about software. Crucially, the people who have been at the receiving end of these harms have not been silent. Women - <a href="https://time.com/5482390/twitter-online-abuse-women-amnesty-international-study/">particularly women of color</a> - have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/15/opinion/gamergate-twitter.html">been sounding the alarm about these harms</a> for years. That we're listening to men who worked to build these systems of abuse, rather than the people who have been calling out the problems this whole time, says a lot about who and what we value. It's not a problem we can code our way out of.</p><p>These conversations are vital. But let's be clear: they have been happening this whole time. If they're new to you, you've been listening to the wrong people. And we should consider whether we want to allow the tech bros who created this problem to whitewash their past.</p>

  <p>This week I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Sep/15/datasette-0-49/">released Datasette 0.49</a> and tinkered with datasette-seaborn, dogsheep-beta and polling data from FiveThirtyEight.</p>
 datasette-seaborn 
<p>Datasette currently has two key plugins for data visualization: <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-vega">datasette-vega</a> for line, bar and scatter charts (powered by <a href="https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/">Vega-Lite</a>) and <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-cluster-map">datsette-cluster-map</a> for creating clustered marker maps.</p>
<p>I'm always looking for other interesting visualization opportunities. Seaborn 0.11 <a href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/whatsnew.html">came out last week</a> and is a very exciting piece of software.</p>
<p>Seaborn focuses on statistical visualization tools - histograms, boxplots and the like - and represents 8 years of development lead by Michael Waskom. It's built on top of <a href="https://matplotlib.org/">Matplotlib</a> and exhibits meticulously good taste.</p>
<p>So I've started building <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-seaborn">datasette-seaborn</a>, a plugin which provides an HTTP interface for generating Seaborn charts using data stored in Datasette.</p>
<p>It's still very alpha but early results are promising. I've chosen to implement it as a <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/plugin_hooks.html#register-output-renderer-datasette">custom output renderer</a> - so adding <code>.seaborn</code> to any Datasette table (plus some querystring parameters) will output a rendered PNG chart of that data, just like how <code>.json</code> or <code>csv</code> give you that data in different export formats.</p>
<p>Here's an example chart generated by the plugin using the fabulous <a href="https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/">palmerpenguins</a> dataset (intended as a new alternative to <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris">Iris</a>).</p>
<p></p>
<p>I generated this image from the following URL:</p>
<p><code>https://datasette-seaborn-demo.datasette.io/penguins/penguins.seaborn?_size=1000&amp;_seaborn=kdeplot&amp;_seaborn_x=flipper_length_mm&amp;_seaborn_hue=species&amp;_seaborn_multiple=stack</code></p>
<p>This interface should be considered unstable and likely to change, but it illustrates the key idea behind the plugin: use <code>?_seaborn_x</code> parameters to feed in options for the chart that you want to render.</p>
<p>The two biggest issues with the plugin right now are that it <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-seaborn/issues/4">renders images on the main thread</a>, potentially blocking the event loop, and it passes querystring arguments directly to seaborn <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-seaborn/issues/3">without first validating them</a> which is almost certainly a security problem.</p>
<p>So very much an alpha, but it's a promising start!</p>
 dogsheep-beta 
<p><a href="https://github.com/dogsheep/dogsheep-beta">Dogsheep Beta</a> provides faceted search across my personal data from a whole variety of different sources.</p>
<p>I demo'd it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPQCD3Qxxik">at PyCon AU</a> a few weeks ago, and promised that a full write-up would follow. I still need to honour that promise! I'm figuring out how to provide a good interactive demo at the moment that doesn't expose my personal data.</p>
<p>I added sort by date in addition to sort by relevance in <a href="https://github.com/dogsheep/dogsheep-beta/releases/tag/0.7">version 0.7</a> this week.</p>
 fivethirtyeight-polls 
<p><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/">FiveThirtEight</a> have long published the data behind their stories in their <a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data">fivethirtyeight/data</a> GitHub repository, and I've been using that data to power <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.datasettes.com/">a Datasette demo</a> ever since I first released the project.</p>
<p>They run an index of their data projects at <a href="https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/">data.fivethirtyeight.com</a>, and this week I noticed that they list US election polling data there that wasn't being picked up by my <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.datasettes.com/">fivethirtyeight.datasettes.com</a> site.</p>
<p>It turns out this is listed in the GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/polls">as a README.md file</a> but without the actual CSV data. Instead, the README links to external CSV files with URLs like <code>https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls-page/president_primary_polls.csv</code></p>
<p>It looks to me like they're running their own custom web application which provides the CSV data as an export format, rather than keeping that CSV data directly in their GitHub repository.</p>
<p>This makes sense - I imagine they run a lot of custom code to help them manage their data - but does mean that <a href="https://github.com/simonw/fivethirtyeight-datasette">my Datasette publishing scripts</a> weren't catching their polling data.</p>
<p>Since they release their data as Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International I decided to start archiving it on GitHub, where it would be easier to automate.</p>
<p>I set up <a href="https://github.com/simonw/fivethirtyeight-polls">simonw/fivethirtyeight-polls</a> to do just that. It's a classic implementation of the <a href="https://github.com/topics/git-scraping">git-scraping pattern</a>: it runs <a href="https://github.com/simonw/fivethirtyeight-polls/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yml">a workflow script</a> four times a day which fetches their latest CSV files and commits them to a repo. This means I now have a <a href="https://github.com/simonw/fivethirtyeight-polls/commits/main">commit history</a> of changes they have made to their polling data!</p>
<p>I updated my FiveThirtyEight Datasette script to publish that data as a new <code>polls.db</code> database, which is now being served at <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.datasettes.com/polls">fivethirtyeight.datasettes.com/polls</a>.</p>
<p>And since that Datasette instance runs the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql">datasette-graphql</a> plugin, you can now use GraphQL to explore FiveThirtyEight's most recent polling data at <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.datasettes.com/graphql/polls">https://fivethirtyeight.datasettes.com/graphql/polls</a> - here's an <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.datasettes.com/graphql/polls?query=%7B%0A%20%20generic_ballot_polls(filter%3A%7Bpollster_rating_name%3A%7Beq%3A%22YouGov%22%7D%7D)%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20totalCount%0A%20%20%20%20nodes%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20pollster%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20sponsor_ids%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20sponsors%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20partisan%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20display_name%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20pollster_rating_name%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20fte_grade%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20population%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20population_full%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20methodology%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20office_type%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20start_date%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20end_date%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20tracking%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20created_at%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20notes%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20url%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20stage%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20dem%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20rep%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20ind%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20question_id%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20poll_id%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20cycle%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20state%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20pollster_id%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20pollster_rating_id%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20sample_size%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20seat_number%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20sponsor_candidate%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20nationwide_batch%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20rowid%0A%20%20%20%20%7D%0A%20%20%7D%0A%7D%0A">example query</a>.</p>
 github-to-sqlite get 
<p><a href="https://github.com/dogsheep/github-to-sqlite">github-to-sqlite</a> lets you fetch data from the GitHub API and write it into a SQLite database.</p>
<p>This week I <a href="https://github.com/dogsheep/github-to-sqlite/issues/50">added a sub-command</a> for hitting the API directly and getting back data on the console, inspired by the <code>fetch</code> subcommand in <code>twitter-to-sqlite</code>. This is useful for trying out new APIs, since it both takes into account your GitHub authentication credentials (from an environment variable or an <code>auth.json</code> file) and can handle <code>Link</code> header pagination.</p>
<p>This example fetches all of my repos, paginating across multiple API requests:</p>
 <code>github-to-sqlite get /users/simonw/repos --paginate
</code> 
<p>You can use the <code>--nl</code> option to get back the results as newline-delimited JSON. This makes it easy to pipe them directly into <code>sqlite-utils</code> like this:</p>
 <code>github-to-sqlite get /users/simonw/repos --paginate --nl \
  | sqlite-utils insert simonw.db repos - --nl
</code> 
<p>See <a href="https://sqlite-utils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cli.html#inserting-json-data">Inserting JSON data</a> in the <code>sqlite-utils</code> documentation for an explanation of what this is doing.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: This is posted by me and does not represent the position of my employer or the working groups of which I am a&nbsp;member.</p><p>In my never-ending quest to come up with super-simple models I came up with this diagram. This post is a slight editorial refactoring of my recent Twitter thread found&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/trbouma/status/1305852608087756802?s=20">here</a>.</p>A simple ecosystem model<p>The above illustration is not intended to be an architectural diagram — rather, it helps to 1) clarify conflations, 2) help define scope (the dotted box) and 3) understand motivations — of the parties that exist ‘outside of the&nbsp;system’</p><p>For example, ‘Issuer” usually gets conflated with ‘Authority’ — an authority merely ‘Attests’ — if you recognize it, then you can assume it is authoritative.</p><p>Anyone can attest to anything and issue something. The point of this model is that everything inside the box is neutral to that and solely focused on specific properties everyone needs regardless of intent or&nbsp;role.</p><p>The “Verifier” usually gets conflated with Relying Party. But a Verifier could be an off-the-shelf black box with the firmware baked in to verify against the right DIDs, challenging the holder with Bluetooth or NFC. The “Acceptor” could be logic that simply throws a switch to open a secure door. All done on behalf of a Relying&nbsp;Party.</p><p>The Holder can be anyone outside the system. An individual, organization or device, that is the ultimate ‘holder’ of secrets or cryptographic keys that is the basis of their power to convey intention.</p><p>Finally, the Registrar, is anyone or anything that is responsible for integrity of the ledger (doesn’t have to be blockchain). This ledger is responsible for two fundamental interactions: validation and transfer. In the case of a permissionless system, the ‘Registrar’ is actually an agreed-on set of rules, and proven (or not yet disproven) cryptographic primitives. For permissioned, or centralized systems, it could be a group of people, or even a single person in the back room with an Excel spreadsheet (not blockchain).</p><p>As for the dotted box — you need to determine who/what sits inside or outside of the box. For many outside the box, they may only care about a black box that they trust. This dotted box is also useful when you start thinking about the non-functional properties of the system — black or grey, should it be permissioned, permissionless, restricted access, globally available?</p><p>In the end, what I am trying to achieve is the expression of a simple conceptual model to help me express what could serve the wide range of use cases e.g.: opening a door, applying for university, letting someone across the border, etc. The model could also be used to express simply what we need to start building as a new digital infrastructure.</p><p>As always, this is a work-in-progress. Constructive comments&nbsp;welcome.</p>

  <p><a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-49">Datasette 0.49</a> is out. Some notes on what's new.</p>
 API for writable canned queries 
<blockquote>
<p>Writable canned queries now expose a JSON API, see <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/sql_queries.html#canned-queries-json-api">JSON API for writable canned queries</a>. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/880">#880</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wrote <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Jun/12/annotated-release-notes/">about writable canned queries</a> when they were introduced in Datasette 0.44 back in June. They provide a mechanism for defining a canned SQL query which can make writes (inserts, updates or deletes) to the underlying SQLite database. They can be protected by <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/authentication.html">Datasette authentication</a> or you can leave them open - for example if you want unauthenticated users to be able to post comments or leave feedback messages.</p>
<p>The missing feature was API support. Datasette 0.49 adds that, so now you can define a canned query that writes to the database and then call it as a JSON API - either without authentication or protected by a mechanism such as that provided by the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-auth-tokens">datasette-auth-tokens</a> plugin.</p>
<p>This feature works with <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Jul/1/datasette-045/">magic parameters</a>, so you can define an API that accepts API traffic and automatically logs things like the incoming IP address. Here's a canned query defined in a <code>metadata.yml</code> file that logs user agent and IP addresses:</p>
  databases:
  logs:
    queries:
      log:
        sql: |-
          INSERT INTO logs (
            user_agent, datetime
          ) VALUES (
            :_header_user_agent, :_now_datetime_utc
          )
        write: true  
<p>Create a SQLite database file called <code>logs.db</code> with the correct table like this:</p>
 <code>$ sqlite-utils create-table logs.db logs id integer user_agent text datetime text --pk=id
</code> 
<p>Confirm the created schema with:</p>
 <code>$ sqlite3 logs.db .schema
CREATE TABLE [logs] (
   [id] INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
   [user_agent] TEXT,
   [datetime] TEXT
);
</code> 
<p>Now start Datasette like so:</p>
 <code>$ datasette logs.db -m metadata.yml
</code> 
<p>And visit <code>http://127.0.0.1:8001/logs/log</code>. You can click the "Run SQL" button there to insert a new log row, which you can then view at <code>http://127.0.0.1:8001/logs/logs</code>.</p>
<p>Next, the API. You can request a JSON response by adding <code>?_json=1</code> to the URL, so try this with <code>curl</code>:</p>
 <code>$ curl -XPOST 'http://127.0.0.1:8001/logs/log?_json=1'
{"ok": true, "message": "Query executed, 1 row affected", "redirect": null}
</code> 
<p>You can also set the <code>Accept: application/json</code> header on your request, like so:</p>
 <code>$ curl -XPOST 'http://127.0.0.1:8001/logs/log' -H 'Accept: application/json'
{"ok": true, "message": "Query executed, 1 row affected", "redirect": null}                                                             ~ % 
</code> 
<p>Or by passing <code>_json=1</code> as part of a POST submission. Let's try that using <code>requests</code>:</p>
 <code>$ ipython
In [1]: import requests
In [2]: requests.post("http://127.0.0.1:8001/logs/log", data={"_json": "1"}).json()
Out[2]: {'ok': True, 'message': 'Query executed, 1 row affected', 'redirect': None}
</code> 
 Path parameters for custom page templates 
<blockquote>
<p>New mechanism for defining page templates with custom path parameters - a template file called <code>pages/about/{slug}.html</code> will be used to render any requests to <code>/about/something</code>. See <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/custom_templates.html#custom-pages-parameters">Path parameters for pages</a>. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/944">#944</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I added custom page support in <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html?highlight=pages#v0-41">Datasette 0.41</a> back in May, based on the needs of my <a href="https://www.niche-museums.com/">Niche Museums</a> site. I wanted an easy way to create things like an <code>/about</code> page that returned content from a custom template.</p>
<p>Custom page templates work as a fallback for Datasette 404s. If <code>/about</code> fails to resolve and Datasette was provided a <code>--template-dir</code> on startup, Datasette will check to see if a template exists called <code>templates/pages/about.html</code>.</p>
<p>Datasette 0.49 adds support for <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/custom_templates.html#path-parameters-for-pages">path parameters</a>, partially inspired by cookiecutter (which showed me that it's OK to create files with curly braces in their name). You can now create templates with <code>{slug}</code> style wildcards as part of their filenames, and Datasette will route matching requests to that template.</p>
<p>I shipped a new release of Niche Museums today that takes advantage of that feature. I wanted neater URLs for museum pages - to shift from <a href="https://www.niche-museums.com/browse/museums/101">https://www.niche-museums.com/browse/museums/101</a> to <a href="https://www.niche-museums.com/101">https://www.niche-museums.com/101</a>.</p>
<p>Here's how it works. I have a template file called <a href="https://github.com/simonw/museums/blob/master/templates/pages/%7Bid%7D.html">templates/pages/{id}.html</a>. That template takes advantage of the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-template-sql">datasette-template-sql</a> plugin, which adds a <code>sql()</code> function that can be called within the template. It starts like this:</p>
  &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
{% set rows = sql("select * from museums where id = :id", {"id": id}) %}
{% if not rows %}
    {{ raise_404("Museum not found") }}
{% endif %}
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
    {% set museum = rows[0] %}
    ... rest of the template here ...  
<p>Datasette made the variable <code>id</code> available to the context having captured it from the <code>{id}.html</code> template matching the incoming URL.</p>
<p>I then use the <code>sql()</code> function to execute a query, passing in <code>id</code> as a query parameter.</p>
<p>If there are no matches, I call the brand new <code>raise_404()</code> template function which cancels the rendering of this template and falls back to Datasette's default 404 handling.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I set the <code>museum</code> variable to <code>rows[0]</code> and continue rendering the page.</p>
<p>I've basically reinvented PHP and ColdFusion in my custom 404 handler. Hooray!</p>
 A few other notable changes 
<blockquote>
<p><code>register_output_renderer()</code> render functions can now return a <code>Response</code>. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/953">#953</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/plugin_hooks.html#register-output-renderer-datasette">register_output_renderer() plugin hook</a> was designed before Datasette had a <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/internals.html#response-class">documented Response class</a>. It asked your plugin to return a custom <code>{"content_type": "...", "body": "...", "status_code": 200, "headers": {}}</code> dictionary.</p>
<p>You can now return a <code>Response</code> instead, and I plan to remove the dictionary version before Datasette 1.0. I released new versions of <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-ics">datasette-ics</a>, <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-atom">datasette-atom</a>, <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-copyable">datasette-copyable</a> and the new <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-yaml">datasette-yaml</a> that use the new return format.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>New <code>--upgrade</code> option for <code>datasette install</code>. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/945">#945</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I added the <code>datasette install datasette-cluster-map</code> command as a thin wrapper around <code>pip install</code>.</p>
<p>This means you can install new plugins without first figuring out which virtual environment your Datasette is running out - particularly useful if you install Datasette <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/installation.html#using-homebrew">using Homebrew</a>.</p>
<p>I then realized that this could be used to upgrade Datasette itself - but only if you could run <code>pip install -U</code>. So now <code>datasette install -U datasette</code> will upgrade Datasette in place.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>New <code>datasette --pdb</code> option. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/962">#962</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is useful if you are working on Datasette itself, or a Datasette plugin. Pass the <code>--pdb</code> option and Datasette will start an interactive Python debugger session any time it hits an exception.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>datasette --get</code> exit code now reflects the internal HTTP status code. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/947">#947</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm excited about the pattern of using <code>datasette --get</code> for running simple soundness checks, e.g. as part of a CI suite. Now that the exit code reflects the status code for the page you can write test scripts that look like this:</p>
 <code># Fail if homepage returns 404 or 500
datasette . --get /
</code> 
<blockquote>
<p>New <code>raise_404()</code> template function for returning 404 errors. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/964">#964</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Demonstrated in the Niche Museums example above.</p>
<p>And the rest:</p>
<blockquote>
 
 
<code>datasette publish heroku</code> now deploys using Python 3.8.5 
 Upgraded <a href="https://codemirror.net/">CodeMirror</a> to 5.57.0. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/948">#948</a>) 
 Upgraded code style to Black 20.8b1. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/958">#958</a>) 
 Fixed bug where selected facets were not correctly persisted in hidden form fields on the table page. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/963">#963</a>) 
 Renamed the default error template from <code>500.html</code> to <code>error.html</code>. 
 Custom error pages are now documented, see <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/custom_templates.html#custom-pages-errors">Custom error pages</a>. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/965">#965</a>) 
 
</blockquote>
<p>In writing up these annotated release notes I spotted <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/967">a bug</a> with writable canned queries, which I have now fixed in <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-49-1">Datasette 0.49.1</a>.</p>

<p>Sophie Zhang worked as the data scientist for the Facebook Site Integrity fake engagement team. She gave up her severance package in order to speak out internally about what she saw there, and someone leaked her memo to BuzzFeed News. It's a hell of a story: she saw bots and coordinated manual accounts used to influence politics in countries all around the world, and found herself constantly making moderation decisions that had lasting political impact. “With no oversight whatsoever, I was left in a situation where I was trusted with immense influence in my spare time". This sounds like a nightmare - imagine taking on responsibility for protecting democracy in so many different places.</p>

<p>Every startup goes through the trough of sorrow. I've found it to be a useful way to describe the period that comes after initial enthusiasm and before things start to work out. It turns out it's quite a useful metaphor for non-startup life, too.</p><p>There are lots of drawings of it out there on the internet. Here's my interpretation:</p><p></p><p>Every new big endeavor comes with an initial rush of enthusiasm. You're elated by the possibilities. This is going to be amazing!</p><p>Then reality sets in, and the deep slide. "Oh fuck," you'll ask yourself. "What do I do now?"</p><p>And that's when you start to experiment. You have to. The thing you thought would work probably won't. Your initial ideas are probably wrong. The story you told yourself during that initial rush of enthusiasm was just that: a story.</p><p>You could stay in this trough of sorrow. Many startups, and many people embarking on creative projects, do just that. They cling too needily to their initial idea, or are ineffective in their experimentation. They run out of steam. Sometimes, when more than one person is involved, they start to fight with each other. (65% of early-stage startups fail because of preventable human dynamics. I would bet that more fail because they run out of hope.)</p><p>You've got to be willing to experiment more rapidly than you're probably comfortable with, using real people (not aggregate statistics or sales figures) as the arbiter of what will work. You've got to be willing to make decisions based on horribly imperfect, qualitative data. You've got to be willing to take a leap of faith. And you've got to be more invested in the journey than in the end product.</p><p>Then maybe - just maybe - you'll make it.</p><p>I've been through the trough of sorrow for virtually every startup I've ever worked at: the two I founded, the two where I was first employee, and the one with a hundred million dollars in the bank. Some made it; some didn't.</p><p>I've also been through the trough of sorrow for every creative project I've ever made. For some of them, I was able to persevere and make it work; others, I abandoned.</p><p>It's about experimentation, it's about luck, it's about treating yourself and your team well, and it's about being able to let go of your precious ideas. If you treat the endeavor as a fait accompli, or go about it as you might in a large organization where you've already found your feet, you will certainly fail.

And, if it’s time to refactor the Nobel Prize, what does that suggest for the prizes your learned society hands out? Adding an ecosystem of badges (to show off skills and accomplishments) to the recognition landscape helps to replace prizes as a central feature of open science. Since prizes celebrate brilliant work, and as celebrations as a whole add positive affect to your culture, let the prizes continue. But give them some new thought. What is your idea for Nobel 2.0?

<p>The <a href="https://info.braze.com/rs/367-GUY-242/images/BrazeDataPrivacyReport.pdf">Braze Privacy Data Report</a> provides useful insights toward understanding U.S. consumers’ (n=2,000) and marketer executives’ (n=500) opinions regarding personal data usage and privacy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The findings are insightful.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Marketers should start to take action now, and prepare themselves for the rise of the self-sovereign individual.&nbsp;</p>



 Individuals expect transparency 



<p>According to the study, individuals want transparency. They want to know,&nbsp;</p>



  
  how their data will be used (94%)  who it will be shared with (74%)  what will be done with it (74%)  what data has been collected (70%)  how long it will be retained (59%)  who is storing it (56%)  
  



<p>Marketers agree (99%), but what consumers and marketers don’t agree on is the value exchange and who should be in control of the policies and rules for privacy and personal information management &amp; oversight.</p>



 Ignoring privacy concerns will hurt the bottom line 



<p>Marketers beware!</p>



<p>The Braze report notes that 84% of U.S. adults have decided against engaging a brand due to personal information requests, and 71% did so more than once; and, 75% stopped engaging with a company all together over privacy concerns.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The message is clear, properly handling privacy will have a positive impact on the bottom line, and not doing so will be detrimental.&nbsp;</p>



 Value exchange is possible 



<p>People are open to exchanging their personal information, but they want something in return; 71% of consumers will share their personal information in exchange for value:&nbsp;</p>



  60% in exchange for cash; a 2018 study by SYZYGY suggested this could be as much as $150 USD (The Price of Personal Data, 2018)  26% for product and incentives  21% for free content.&nbsp;  



<p>We see a gap here between consumers and marketing executives, as only 31% of marketing executives believe consumers should receive cash in exchange for personal data.&nbsp;</p>



 The privacy expectation gap 



<p>Again, we have a privacy expectations gap in the U.S.; the report finds that 82% of U.S. adults say privacy is important to them, while only 29% of marketing executives hold the same opinion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is time for the market to listen and begin to respect the sovereignty of the individual.</p>



 Rules and regulations 



<p>As for who should set the rules and regulations for personal information management &amp; oversight and exchange and privacy protection, it’s not clear.</p>



<p>Marketing executives (88%) find the state-by-state sectoral approach in the US burdensome and believe that federal direction could provide clearer directions. And yet, just 52% of marketers and consumers believe the Federal governments should do more.&nbsp;</p>



 The Bottom line 



<p>The bottom line is clear. People are waking up to the fact that their personal information has value. They’re open to exchange, but they expect transparency and compensation. Clearly, from a consumer attitudinal perspective, the personal information economy is at hand, but it is also clear there are industry and regulatory gaps that must first start to close; moreover, we need to develop and deploy the tools to help people safely and securely engage in the exchange of their personal information. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Proactively managing your privacy is no longer a luxury, it is a must and it takes conscious effort. One step you may not have considered is blurring your house, face, car or license plate, or some other object on Google Maps? </p>



<p>Why would you want to do this, you might ask? Well, here are a few reasons; I’m sure there are more.</p>



  You have street-facing windows from your bedroom or living room  You’ve been a victim and want to minimize your digital footprint  You generally want to maintain your privacy&nbsp;  



<p>If you decide to do it, it is surprisingly easy. &nbsp;</p>



 Steps to Blur your house on Google Maps 



<p>You can follow the steps below to blur your house on Google Maps.</p>



<p>Warning: According to Google, the blurring of an image on Google Maps is permanent; you can’t reverse it. So, be sure this is what you want to do before you proceed.&nbsp;</p>







  Go to <a href="http://google.com/maps">Google Maps</a> and enter your home address  Click on the picture of your house to enter Street View mode  Click “Report a problem” link in the bottom-right corner of the screen  Center the red box on the object you want to blur, like your car or home  Click on the object type in the “Request blurring” list  Provide an explanation of why you want to blur the object, in the filed that appears  Enter your email address and hit Sumit.  



<p>Google will evaluate your request. The team (or systems) at Google will consider your request; it is not clear how long this will take. Once they’ve finished reviewing your request, they will let you know if it has been approved or rejected.&nbsp;</p>

   I'm delighted to say that
Spritely Goblins
v0.7
has been released!
This is the first release featuring
CapTP support
(ie, "capability-secure distributed/networked programming support"),
which is a huge milestone for the project! 
 Okay, caveat... there are still some things missing from the CapTP
stuff so far; you can …

<p>I'm delighted to say that
<a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/goblins/">Spritely Goblins</a>
<a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblins/-/tree/v0.7">v0.7</a>
has been released!
This is the first release featuring
<a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/goblins/captp.html">CapTP support</a>
(ie, "capability-secure distributed/networked programming support"),
which is a huge milestone for the project!</p>
<p>Okay, caveat... there are still some things missing from the CapTP
stuff so far; you can only set up a bidirectional connection between
two machines, and can't "introduce" capabilities to other machines
on the network.
Also setting up connections is an extremely manual process.
Both of those should be improved in the next release.</p>
<p>But still!
Goblins can now be used to easily write distributed programs!
And Goblins' CapTP code even includes such wild features as
distributed garbage collection!</p>
<p>As an example
(also mentioned in a <a>recent blogpost</a>),
I recently wrote a short
<a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblin-chat">chat program demo</a>.
Both the client and server "protocol" code were
<a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblin-chat/-/blob/master/chat-backend.rkt">less than 250 lines of code</a>,
despite having such features as authenticating users during
subscription to the chatroom and verifying that messages claimed by
the chatroom came from the users it said it did.
(The <a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblin-chat/-/blob/master/goblin-chat-gui.rkt">GUI code</a>,
by contrast, was a little less than 300 lines.)
I wrote this up without writing any network code at all and then
tested hooking together two clients over Tor Onion Services using
Goblins' CapTP support, and it Just Worked (TM):</p>
<p></p>
<p>What's interesting here is that
not a single line of code was added to the backend or GUI to accomodate networking;
the <a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblin-chat/-/blob/master/onion-gui-server.rkt">host</a>
and <a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblin-chat/-/blob/master/onion-gui-client.rkt">guest</a>
modules merely imported the backend and GUI files completely unchanged and
did the network wiring there.
Yes, that's what it sounds like: in Goblins you can write distributed
asynchronous programs </p>
<p>This is the really significant part of Goblins that's starting to
become apparent, and it's all thanks to the brilliant design of
<a href="http://erights.org/elib/distrib/captp/index.html">CapTP</a>.
Goblins continues to stand on the shoulders of giants; thank you to
everyone in the ocap community, but especially in this case
Michael FIG, Mark S. Miller, Kevin Reid, and Baldur Jóhannsson, all of
whom answered an enormous amount of questions (some of them very
silly) about CapTP.</p>
<p>There are more people to thank too (too many to list here), and you
can see some of them in this
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/cap-talk/xWv2-J62g-I">monster thread on the captp mailing list</a>
which started on May 18th (!!!) as I went through my journey of trying
to understand and eventually implement CapTP.
I actually started preparing a few weeks before which really means that
this journey took me about four and a half months to understand and
implement.
As it turns out, CapTP is a surprisingly simple protocol protocol
in its coneptualization once you understand what it's doing (though
implementing it is a bit more complex).
I do hope to try to build a guide for others to understand and
implement on their own systems... but that will probably wait until
Goblins is ported to another language (due to the realative simplicity
of the task due to the language similarities, the current plan is to
port to Guile next).</p>
<p>Anyway.
This is a big deal, a truly exciting moment for goblinkind.
If you're excited yourself, maybe join the
<a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=fossandcrafts">#spritely channel on irc.freenode.net</a>.</p>
<p>OH!
And also, I can't believe I nearly forgot to say this, but if you want
to hear more about Spritely in general (not just Goblins), we just
<a href="https://fossandcrafts.org/episodes/9-what-is-spritely.html">released a Spritely-centric episode of FOSS and Crafts</a>.
Maybe take a listen!</p>

   I just want to thank Alaska for alerting me to the fact that I will have earned triple miles on all flights that I took through the Summer. Really was very kind of them. Generous. Unexpected. 

 Just wondering if they’d noticed how empty their flights were through the Summer.

  <p>I spent some time this week digging into Python's sqlite3 internals. I also gave two talks and recorded a third, due to air at PyGotham in October.</p>
 sqlite-dump and datasette-backup 
<p>I'm running an increasing number of Datasette instances with mutable database files - databases that are updated through a variety of different mechanisms. So I need to start thinking about backups.</p>
<p>Prior to this most of my database files had been relatively disposable: they're built from other sources of data (often by scheduled GitHub Actions) so backups weren't necessary since I could always rebuild them from their point of truth.</p>
<p>Creating a straight copy of a SQLite database file isn't enough for robust backups, because the file may be accepting writes while you are creating the copy.</p>
<p>SQLite has various mechanisms for backups. There's an <a href="https://sqlite.org/backup.html">online backup API</a> and more recent SQLite versions support a <a href="https://sqlite.org/lang_vacuum.html#vacuuminto">VACUUM INTO</a> command which also optimizes the backed up database.</p>
<p>I figured it would be useful to expose this functionality by a Datasette plugin - one that could allow automated backups to be directly fetched from Datasette over HTTPS. So I started work on <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-backup">datasette-backup</a>.</p>
<p>For the first backup mode, I decided to take advantage of the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.Connection.iterdump">connection.iterdump()</a> method that's built into Python's sqlite3 module. This method is an iterator that outputs plain text SQL that can recreate a database. Crucially it's a streaming-compatible mechanism - unlike <code>VACUUM INTO</code> which would require me to create a temporary file the same as the database I was backing up.</p>
<p>I started experimenting with it, and ran into <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-backup/issues/5">a big problem</a>. I make extensive use of SQLite full-text search, but the <code>.sql</code> dumps generated by <code>.iterdump()</code> break with constraint errors if they include any FTS tables.</p>
<p>After a bit of digging I came across <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blame/v3.8.5/Lib/sqlite3/dump.py#L38-L45">a 13 year old comment about this</a> in the cPython source code itself!</p>
<p>The implementation for <code>.iterdump()</code> turns out to be entirely in Python, and way less complicated than I had expected. So I decided to see if I could get FTS table exports working.</p>
<p>In a classic case of yak shaving, I decided to create a Python library called <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-dump">sqlite-dump</a> to solve this problem. And since my existing cookiecutter templates only cover <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-plugin">Datasette Plugins</a> or <a href="https://github.com/simonw/click-app">Click apps</a> I first needed to create a new <a href="https://github.com/simonw/python-lib">python-lib</a> template in order to create the library I needed for my plugin.</p>
<p>I got it working! Install the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-backup">datasette-backup</a> plugin on any Datasette instance to get a <code>/-/backup/name-of-database.sql</code> URL that will produce a streaming SQL dump of any attached database.</p>
 A weird bug with SQLite FTS and triggers 
<p>While working on <code>datasette-backup</code> I noticed a weird issue with some of my SQLite full-text search enabled databases: they kept getting bigger. Way bigger than I would expect them to.</p>
<p>I eventually noticed that the <code>licenses_fts</code> table in my <a href="https://github-to-sqlite.dogsheep.net/">github-to-sqlite demo database</a> had 7 rows in it, but the accompanying <code>licenses_fts_docsize</code> table had 9,141. I would expect it to only have 7 as well.</p>
<p>I was stumped as to what was going on, so I <a href="https://sqlite.org/forum/forumpost/e05a261524">turned to the official SQLite forum</a>. I only recently discovered how useful this is as a resource. Dan Kennedy, one of the three core SQLite maintainers, replied within an hour and gave me some useful hints. The root cause turned out to be the way SQLite triggers work: by default, SQLite runs in <code>recursive_triggers=off</code> mode (for backwards compatibility with older databases). This means that an <code>INSERT OR REPLACE</code> update to a table that is backed by full-text search may not correctly trigger the updates needed on the FTS table itself.</p>
<p>Since there doesn't appear to be any disadvantage to running with <code>recursive_triggers=on</code> I've now set that as the default for <code>sqlite-utils</code>, as-of <a href="https://sqlite-utils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v2-17">version 2.17</a>.</p>
<p>I then added a <code>sqlite-utils rebuild-fts data.db</code> command in <a href="https://sqlite-utils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v2-18">version 2.18</a> which can rebuild the FTS tables in a database and fix the <code>_fts_docsize</code> problem.</p>
 Talks 
<p>I presented Build your own data warehouse for personal analytics with SQLite and Datasette at PyCon AU last week. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPQCD3Qxxik">video is here</a> and includes my first public demo of <a href="https://github.com/dogsheep/beta">Dogsheep Beta</a>, my new combined search engine for personal analytics data imported using my <a href="https://dogsheep.github.io/">Dogsheep</a> family of tools. I took questions in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q0sH954Iv83sctmB_sfHJg2zZMYZGhY_n2s38yOCpOU/edit#heading=h.b1b8d2228j9">this Google Doc</a>, and filled out more detailed answers after the talk.</p>
<p>I gave a talk at PyRVA a couple of days called Rapid data analysis with SQLite and Datasette. Here's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5U3RyzxTKtQ">the video</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1clxqE0xCqPw5baFLGKOr29iur1sV9ruMj8MNW-Xlzpo/edit">Google Doc</a> for that one.</p>
<p>I also pre-recorded my talk for PyGotham: <a href="https://2020.pygotham.tv/talks/datasette-an-ecosystem-of-tools-for-working-with-small-data/">Datasette - an ecosystem of tools for working with Small Data</a>. The conference is in the first week of October and I'll be hanging out there during the talk answering questions and chatting about the project, safe from the stress of also having to present it live!</p>

<p>The white mess in the image above is the <a href="https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/7152/">Bobcat Fire</a>, spreading now in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Gabriel_Mountains">San Gabriel Mountains</a>, against which Los Angeles’ suburban sprawl (that’s it, on the right) reaches its limits of advance to the north. It makes no sense to build very far up or into these mountains, for two good reasons. One is fire, which happens often and awfully. The other is that the mountains are geologically new, and falling down almost as fast as they are rising up. At the mouths of valleys emptying into the sprawl are vast empty reservoirs—catch basins—ready to be filled with rocks, soil and mud “downwasting,” as geologists say, from a range as big as the Smokies, twice as high, ready to burn and shed.</p>
<p>Outside of its northern rain forests and snow-capped mountains, California has just two seasons: fire and rain. Right now we’re in the midst of fire season. Rain is called Winter, and it has been dry since the last one. If the Bobcat fire burns down to the edge of Monrovia, or Altadena, or any of the towns at the base of the mountains, heavy winter rains will cause downwasting in a form&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McPhee">John McPhee</a> describes in <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1988/09/26/los-angeles-against-the-mountains-i">Los Angeles Against the Mountains</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The water was now spreading over the street. It descended in heavy sheets. As the young Genofiles and their mother glimpsed it in the all but total darkness, the scene was suddenly illuminated by a blue electrical flash. In the blue light they saw a massive blackness, moving. It was not a landslide, not a mudslide, not a rock avalanche; nor by any means was it the front of a conventional flood. In Jackie’s words, “It was just one big black thing coming at us, rolling, rolling with a lot of water in front of it, pushing the water, this big black thing. It was just one big black hill coming toward us.</p>
<p>In geology, it would be known as a debris flow. Debris flows amass in stream valleys and more or less resemble fresh concrete. They consist of water mixed with a good deal of solid material, most of which is above sand size. Some of it is Chevrolet size. Boulders bigger than cars ride long distances in debris flows. Boulders grouped like fish eggs pour downhill in debris flows. The dark material coming toward the Genofiles was not only full of boulders; it was so full of automobiles it was like bread dough mixed with raisins. On its way down Pine Cone Road, it plucked up cars from driveways and the street. When it crashed into the Genofiles’ house, the shattering of safety glass made terrific explosive sounds. A door burst open. Mud and boulders poured into the hall. We’re going to go, Jackie thought. Oh, my God, what a hell of a way for the four of us to die together.</p></blockquote>
<p>Three rains ago we had debris flows in Montecito, the next zip code over from our home in Santa Barbara. I wrote about it in&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2018/01/15/montecito/">Making sense of what happened to Montecito</a>. The flows, which destroyed much of the town and killed about two dozen people, were caused by heavy rains following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Fire">Thomas Fire</a>, which at 281,893 acres was biggest fire in California history at the time. The&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Fire_(2018)">Camp Fire</a>, a few months later, burned a bit less land but killed 85 people and destroyed more than 18,000 buildings, including whole towns. This year we already have two fires bigger than the Thomas, and at least three more growing fast enough to take the lead. You can see the whole updated list on the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/wildfires-map/">Los Angeles Times California Wildfires Map</a>.</p>
<p>For a good high-altitude picture of what’s going on, I recommend NASA’s&nbsp;<a href="https://firms2.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/map/">FIRMS (Fire Information for Resource Management System)</a>. It’s a highly interactive map that lets you mix input from satellite photographs and fire detection by orbiting&nbsp;<a href="https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/">MODIS</a> and <a href="https://ncc.nesdis.noaa.gov/VIIRS/">VIIRS</a>&nbsp;systems. MODIS is onboard the <a href="https://terra.nasa.gov/">Terra</a> and <a href="https://aqua.nasa.gov/">Aqua</a> satellites; and VIIRS is onboard the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/NPP/main/index.html">Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP)</a> spacecraft. (It’s actually more complicated than that. If you’re interested, dig into those links.) Here’s how the FIRMS map shows the active West Coast fires and the smoke they’re producing:</p>
<p></p>
<p>That’s a lot of cremated forest and wildlife right there.</p>
<p>I just put those two images and a bunch of others up on Flickr,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/albums/72157715920586418">here</a>. Most are of MODIS fire detections superimposed on 3-D Google Earth maps. The main thing I want to get across with these is how large and anomalous these fires are.</p>
<p>True: fire is essential to many of the West’s wild ecosystems. It’s no accident that the California state tree, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequoia_sempervirens">Coast Redwood</a>, grows so tall and lives so long: it’s&nbsp;adapted to fire. (One can also make a case that the state flower, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschscholzia_californica">California Poppy</a>, which thrives amidst fresh rocks and soil, is adapted to earthquakes.) But what’s going on here is something much bigger. Explain it any way you like, including strange luck.</p>
<p>Whatever you conclude, it’s a hell of a show. And vice versa.</p>

   15 rules for blogging, and my current streak 
 Matt Webb is on a 24 week streak of blogging multiple posts a week and shares his rules on how he's doing this. These are really good rules. A rule of thumb that has helped me a lot is to fight back against the temptation to make a post as good as I can before I publish it -  because that way lies a giant drafts folder and no actual published content.

<p>I just got this email today:<br>
</p>
<p>Which tells me, from a sample of one (after another, after another) that Zoom is to video conferencing in 2020 what Microsoft Windows was to personal computing in 1999. Back then one business after another said they would only work with Windows and what was left of DOS: Microsoft’s two operating systems for PCs.</p>
<p>What saved the personal computing world from being absorbed into Microsoft was the Internet—and the Web, running on the Internet. The Internet, based on a profoundly generative protocol, supported all kinds of hardware and software at an infinitude of end points. And the Web, based on an equally generative protocol, manifested on browsers that ran on Mac and Linux computers, as well as Windows ones.</p>
<p>But video conferencing is different. Yes, all the popular video conferencing systems run in apps that work on multiple operating systems, and on the two main mobile device OSes as well. And yes, they are substitutable. You don’t have to use Zoom (unless, in cases like mine, where talking to my doctors requires it). There’s still Skype, Webex, Microsoft Teams, Google Hangouts and the rest.</p>
<p>But all of them have a critical dependency through their&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codec">codecs</a>. Those are the ways they code and decode audio and video.&nbsp;While there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_open-source_codecs">some open source codecs</a>, all the systems I just named use&nbsp;proprietary (patent-based) codecs. The big winner among those is&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Video_Coding">H.264, aka AVC-1</a>, which Wikipedia says “is by far the most commonly used format for the recording, compression, and distribution of video content, used by 91% of video industry developers as of September 2019.” Also,</p>
<blockquote><p>H.264 is perhaps best known as being the most commonly used video encoding format on&nbsp;<a title="Blu-ray Disc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blu-ray_Disc">Blu-ray Discs</a>. It is also widely used by streaming Internet sources, such as videos from&nbsp;<a title="Netflix" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix">Netflix</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Hulu" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu">Hulu</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Prime Video" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Video">Prime Video</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Vimeo" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vimeo">Vimeo</a>,&nbsp;<a title="YouTube" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube">YouTube</a>, and the&nbsp;<a title="ITunes Store" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes_Store">iTunes Store</a>, Web software such as the&nbsp;<a title="Adobe Flash Player" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash_Player">Adobe Flash Player</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Microsoft Silverlight" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Silverlight">Microsoft Silverlight</a>, and also various&nbsp;<a title="HDTV" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDTV">HDTV</a>&nbsp;broadcasts over terrestrial (<a title="Advanced Television Systems Committee standards" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Television_Systems_Committee_standards">ATSC</a>,&nbsp;<a title="ISDB-T" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISDB-T">ISDB-T</a>,&nbsp;<a title="DVB-T" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVB-T">DVB-T</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a title="DVB-T2" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVB-T2">DVB-T2</a>), cable (<a title="DVB-C" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVB-C">DVB-C</a>), and satellite (<a title="DVB-S" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVB-S">DVB-S</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="DVB-S2" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVB-S2">DVB-S2</a>) systems.</p>
<p>H.264 is protected by&nbsp;<a title="Patent" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent">patents</a>&nbsp;owned by various parties. A license covering most (but not all) patents essential to H.264 is administered by a&nbsp;<a title="Patent pool" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_pool">patent pool</a>&nbsp;administered by&nbsp;<a title="MPEG LA" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG_LA">MPEG LA</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Video_Coding#cite_note-9">[9]</a></p>
<p>The commercial use of patented H.264 technologies requires the payment of royalties to MPEG LA and other patent owners. MPEG LA has allowed the free use of H.264 technologies for streaming Internet video that is free to end users, and&nbsp;<a title="Cisco Systems" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_Systems">Cisco Systems</a>&nbsp;pays royalties to MPEG LA on behalf of the users of binaries for its&nbsp;<a title="Open-source software" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">open source</a>&nbsp;H.264 encoder.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generativity">generative</a>, clearly, but <a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/9385626/Zittrain_Generative%20Internet.pdf?sequence=1">not as generative</a> as the Internet and the Web, which are both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_principle">end-to-end</a>&nbsp;by design. .</p>
<p>More importantly, AVC-1 in effect slides the Internet and the Web into the orbit of companies that have taken over what used to be telephony and television, which are now mooshed together. In the Columbia Doctors example, Zoom the new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_telephone_system">PBX</a>. The new classroom is every teacher and kid on her or his own rectangle, “zooming” with each other through the new telephony. The new TV is Netflix, Disney, Comcast, Spectrum, Apple, Amazon and many others, all competing for wedges our Internet access and entertainment budgets.</p>
<p>In this new ecosystem, you are less the producer than you were, or would have been, in the early days of the Net and the Web. You are the end user, the consumer, the audience, the customer. Not the producer, the performer. Sure, you can audition for those roles, and play them on YouTube and TikTok, but those are somebody else’s walled gardens. You operate within them at their grace. You are not truly free.</p>
<p>And maybe none of us ever were, in those early days of the Net and the Web. But it sure seemed that way. And it&nbsp;does seem that we have lost something.</p>
<p>Or maybe just that we are slowly losing it, in the manner of boiling frogs.</p>
<p>Do we have to? I mean, it’s still early.</p>
<p>The digital world is how old? Decades, at most.</p>
<p>And how long will it last? At the very least, more than that. Centuries or millennia, probably.</p>
<p>So there’s hope.</p>
<p>[Later…] For some of that, dig OBS—Open Broadcaster Software’s <a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS Studio</a>:&nbsp;Free and open source software for video recording and live streaming. <a href="https://twitter.com/jgro/status/1303519607236460544">HT</a>: Joel Grossman (<a href="https://twitter.com/jgro/">@jgro</a>).</p>

<p>This past July, we replaced our roof and at the same time updated our <a href="https://altmode.org/2009/06/14/photovoltaic-part-3-results/">solar panels and inverter</a> (I’ll write about the new solar equipment in the near future). I was monitoring the new equipment somewhat more closely than usual, and noticed on one warm August day that the inverter had shut down due to low line voltage. Having home solar generation shut down on a warm day with a high air conditioning load is the opposite of what the utility, <a href="https://www.pge.com">Pacific Gas &amp; Electric</a> (PG&amp;E), should want to happen. In addition to shutting down solar power inverters, low line voltage can be hard on power equipment, such as motors.</p>



<p>At a time when our voltage was particularly low, I opened a low line voltage case with PG&amp;E. This resulted in a call from a field technician that told me several things:</p>



  PG&amp;E has been aware of the voltage regulation problem in my neighborhood for some time  The problem is likely to be due to the older 4-kilovolt service in my part of town. Newer areas have 12-kilovolt service that would be expected to have about 1/9 the voltage drop with an equivalent load.  Another possible cause is the pole transformer that feeds our house and nearby neighbors that the technician told me is overloaded. [Other neighbors that aren’t as close are reporting these problems as well, so they would have to have similarly overloaded transformers.]  Line voltage at my home is supposed to be between 114 and 126 VAC.  



<p>Another technician from PG&amp;E came out a couple of days later to install a voltage monitor on the line. But it occurred to me that I have been collecting data since 2007 from my solar inverter that includes voltage data. A total of about 3.2 million data points. So I thought I’d check to see what I can find out from that.</p>



<p>My data are in a MySQL database that I can query easily. So asked it how many days there have been where the line voltage went below 110 VAC (giving PG&amp;E some margin here) and the solar inverter was fully operating. There were 37 such days, including very brief voltage dips (&lt;10 minutes) up to over 5 hours undervoltage on September 2, 2017. The line voltage that day looked like this:</p>







<p>A more recent representative sample is this:</p>







<p>Part of my concern is that this problem seems to be getting worse. Here is a table of the number days where &lt;110 VAC lasted for more than 10 minutes:</p>



YearDays with<br>UndervoltageUndervoltage<br>Minutes2007002008002009114201000201100201200201300201400201511920161102017141386201800201975612020 (to June 30)2160



<p>And as I mentioned above, the problem seems to occur on particularly hot days (which is when others run their air conditioners; we don’t have air conditioning). Fortunately, the <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/">NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information</a> provide good historical data on high and low temperatures. I was able to download the data for Los Altos and relate it to the days with the outages. Indeed, the days with the most serious voltage problems are very warm (high of 110 on 9/2/2017 and 100 degrees on 6/3/2020 shown above).</p>



<p>Does that mean we’re seeing purely a temperature effect that is happening more often due to global warming? It doesn’t seem likely because there have been very warm days in past years with little voltage drop. Here’s a day with a recorded high temperature of 108 in 2009:</p>







<p>My street, and the <a href="https://losaltosca.gov">City of Los Altos</a> more generally, has seen a lot of extensive home renovations and tear-down/rebuilds the past few years. The section of the street I live on, which has about 50 homes, currently has three homes being completely rebuilt and currently unoccupied. So this is only going to get worse.</p>



<p>The ongoing renovations and rebuilds in Los Altos are all considerably larger than the homes (built in the 1950s) that they replace, and I expect nearly all have air conditioning while the original homes didn’t. This is resulting in a considerably higher electrical load on infrastructure that wasn’t designed for this. While this is mitigated somewhat by the prevalence of solar panels in our area, the City needs to require that PG&amp;E upgrade its infrastructure before issuing new building permits that will exacerbate this problem.</p>

<p>In this tutorial we'll use a Raspberry Pi to build an RTMP server that plays out any video stream it receives over the Raspberry Pi's HDMI port automatically. This effectively turns a Raspberry Pi into a Blackmagic Streaming Bridge.</p>

<p>You can use this to stream from OBS or an ATEM Mini across your local network or the internet, and convert that to an HDMI signal in your studio to mix with other HDMI sources locally.</p>



 Parts 

<p>Here's a list of all the parts you'll need for this.</p>

<p>Of course, you'll need a <a href="https://geni.us/APX4YZa">Raspberry Pi</a>. It doesn't need a ton of RAM, I got one with 4GB but it would probably work fine with 2GB as well. I prefer to buy the parts individually rather than the full kits, but either way is fine. If you get the bare Raspberry Pi you'll need to make sure to get a good quality power supply like <a href="https://geni.us/qDB8E">this one</a>.</p>

<p>I have tested this on a Raspberry Pi 3, and it does work, but there's much more of a delay, so I definitely recommend doing this with a Raspberry Pi 4 instead.</p>

<p>Get a good quality SD card for the Pi. We won't be doing anything super disk intensive, but it will generally perform a lot better with an SD Card with an "A1" or "A2" rating. You don't need much disk space, 16gb, 32gb or 64gb cards are all good options. The "A1" or "A2" ratings mean the card is optimized for running applications rather than storing photos or videos. I like the Sandisk cards, either the <a href="https://geni.us/d3F5G4n">32gb A1</a> or the slightly faster <a href="https://geni.us/LOabG">64gb A2</a>.</p>

<p>You'll need a case for the Pi as well. I like <a href="https://geni.us/yu4Y">this one</a> which is also a giant heat sink so that it's completely silent.</p>

<p>The Raspberry Pi 4 has a Micro HDMI port rather than a full size, so you'll need a cable to plug that in to a regular size HDMI port like <a href="https://geni.us/s3rIb2">this one</a>.</p>

<p>Make sure you have your Raspberry Pi and whatever device you're streaming from connected via a wired network. While this will probably work over wifi, I wouldn't count on wifi to be reliable or fast for this.</p>

 Prepare the Raspberry Pi SD Card 

<p>First, head over to <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/">raspberrypi.org/downloads</a> to download the Raspberry Pi Imager app. This app makes it super easy to create an SD card with the Raspberry Pi OS.</p>

<p></p>

<p>When you choose the operating system to install, select "Other"</p>

<p></p>

<p>then choose "Lite"</p>

<p></p>

<p>We don't need a desktop environment for this so it will be easier to use the command line.</p>

<p>Go ahead and write this to the SD card, then take out the SD card and put it into the Raspberry Pi.</p>

 Configure the OS 

<p>The first time you boot it up it will take a few seconds and then it will prompt you to log in.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Log in using the default username and password. Enter the username "pi", and then type the password "raspberry". You won't see the password as you're typing it.</p>

<p>It's a good idea to change the password to something else, so go ahead and do that now. Type:</p>

 <code>sudo raspi-config
</code> 

<p>and choose the first option in the menu by pressing "Enter". When you type the new password, you won't see it on the screen, but it will ask you to type it twice to confirm. Press "tab" twice to select "Finish" to close out of this menu.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next we need to configure the video mode so we know what kind of signal the Raspberry Pi will be sending on the HDMI port. You'll need to edit a text file to make these changes.</p>

 <code>sudo nano /boot/config.txt
</code> 

<p>This will launch a text editor to edit this file. We need to change the following things in the file. These may be commented out with a <code>#</code> so you can delete that character to uncomment the line and make the necessary changes. These options are documented <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/config-txt/video.md">here</a>.</p>

 <code># Make sure the image fits the whole screen
disable_overscan=1

# Set HDMI output mode to Consumer Electronics Association mode
hdmi_group=1

# Enable audio over HDMI
hdmi_drive=2

# Set the output resolution and frame rate to your desired option

# 1920x1080 60fps
hdmi_mode=16 

# 1920x1080 25fps
hdmi_mode=33

# 1920x1080 30fps
hdmi_mode=34
</code> 

<p>To save your changes, press Ctrl+X and then "Y" to confirm, then "Enter". At this point we need to reboot to make the changes take effect, so type:</p>

 <code>sudo reboot
</code> 

<p>and wait a few seconds for it to reboot.</p>

 Install and Configure Software 

<p>We'll be using nginx with the RTMP module as the RTMP server, and then connect omxplayer to play out the stream over the HDMI port.</p>

<p>Install the necessary software by typing:</p>

 <code>sudo apt update
sudo apt install omxplayer nginx libnginx-mod-rtmp
</code> 

<p>We need to give nginx permission to use the video port, so do that with the following command:</p>

 <code>sudo usermod -aG video www-data
</code> 

<p>Now we need to set up an RTMP server in nginx. Edit the main nginx config file:</p>

 <code>sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
</code> 

<p>Scroll all the way to the bottom and copy the below text into the config file:</p>

 <code>rtmp {
  server {
    listen 1935;

    application live {
      # Enable livestreaming
      live on;

      # Disable recording
      record off;

      # Allow only this machine to play back the stream
      allow play 127.0.0.1;
      deny play all;

      # Start omxplayer and play the stream out over HDMI
      exec omxplayer -o hdmi rtmp://127.0.0.1:1935/live/$name;
    }
  }
}
</code> 

<p>The magic sauce here is the <code>exec</code> line that starts omxplayer. omxplayer is an application that can play an RTMP stream out over the Raspberry Pi's HDMI port. The <code>exec</code> line will run this command whenever a new RTMP stream is received. The stream key will be set to the <code>$name</code> variable. Note that this means any stream key will work, there is no access control the way we have it configured here. You can read up on the <a href="https://github.com/arut/nginx-rtmp-module/wiki/Directives">RTMP module</a> if you'd like to learn how to lock down access to only specific stream keys or if you want to enable recording the stream.</p>

<p>Save this file by pressing ctrl+X, then Y, then enter.</p>

<p>To test the config file for errors, type:</p>

 <code>sudo nginx -t
</code> 

<p>If that worked, you can reload nginx to make your changes take effect:</p>

 <code>sudo nginx -s reload
</code> 

<p>At this point the Raspberry Pi is ready! You can now stream to this box and it will output the received stream over HDMI! Any stream key will work, and you can stream using any sort of device or software like OBS. You'll need to find the IP address of the Raspberry Pi which you can do by typing</p>

 <code>hostname -I
</code> 

<p>To stream to the Raspberry Pi, use the RTMP URL: <code>rtmp://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS/live</code> and anything as the stream key.</p>

 Setting up the ATEM Mini 

<p>We'll now walk through setting up an ATEM Mini Pro to stream to the Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>If you're familiar with customizing your ATEM Software's <code>Streaming.xml</code> file, you can add a new entry with the Raspberry Pi's IP address. But there is another way which I like better, which is to create a custom streaming file that you can send to a remote guest and they can add it in their Software Control app without needing to edit any XML.</p>

<p>Create a new XML file with the following contents. This is the contents of one of the <code>&lt;service&gt;</code> blocks from the <code>Streaming.xml</code> file, wrapped with a <code>&lt;streaming&gt;</code> element.</p>

 <code>&lt;streaming&gt;
    &lt;service&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;Raspberry Pi&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;servers&gt;
            &lt;server&gt;
                &lt;name&gt;Primary&lt;/name&gt;
                &lt;url&gt;rtmp://RASPBERRY_PI_IP/live&lt;/url&gt;
            &lt;/server&gt;
        &lt;/servers&gt;
        &lt;profiles&gt;
            &lt;profile&gt;
                &lt;name&gt;Streaming High&lt;/name&gt;
                &lt;config resolution="1080p" fps="60"&gt;
                    &lt;bitrate&gt;9000000&lt;/bitrate&gt;
                    &lt;audio-bitrate&gt;128000&lt;/audio-bitrate&gt;
                    &lt;keyframe-interval&gt;2&lt;/keyframe-interval&gt;
                &lt;/config&gt;
                &lt;config resolution="1080p" fps="30"&gt;
                    &lt;bitrate&gt;6000000&lt;/bitrate&gt;
                    &lt;audio-bitrate&gt;128000&lt;/audio-bitrate&gt;
                    &lt;keyframe-interval&gt;2&lt;/keyframe-interval&gt;
                &lt;/config&gt;
            &lt;/profile&gt;
            &lt;profile&gt;
                &lt;name&gt;Streaming Low&lt;/name&gt;
                &lt;config resolution="1080p" fps="60"&gt;
                    &lt;bitrate&gt;4500000&lt;/bitrate&gt;
                    &lt;audio-bitrate&gt;128000&lt;/audio-bitrate&gt;
                    &lt;keyframe-interval&gt;2&lt;/keyframe-interval&gt;
                &lt;/config&gt;
                &lt;config resolution="1080p" fps="30"&gt;
                    &lt;bitrate&gt;3000000&lt;/bitrate&gt;
                    &lt;audio-bitrate&gt;128000&lt;/audio-bitrate&gt;
                    &lt;keyframe-interval&gt;2&lt;/keyframe-interval&gt;
                &lt;/config&gt;
            &lt;/profile&gt;
        &lt;/profiles&gt;
    &lt;/service&gt;      
&lt;/streaming&gt;
</code> 

<p>Replace the IP address with your own, and you can customize the <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> as well which will show up in the ATEM Software Control. Save this file with an <code>.xml</code> extension.</p>

<p>In the ATEM Software Control app, click "Stream" from the menu bar, choose "Load Streaming Settings", and select the XML file you created.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This will create a new option in the "Live Stream" section where you can stream to the Raspberry Pi instead of YouTube!</p>

<p></p>

<p>Go ahead and enter a streaming key now, it doesn't matter what you enter since there is no access control on the Raspberry Pi. Click "On Air" and in a few seconds you should see the image pop up on the Raspberry Pi!</p>

<p>Today in <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/creepy-geofence-finds-anyone-near-crime-scene/?bxid=5cc9e0b124c17c766aabcf24&amp;cndid=52111978&amp;esrc=Wired_etl_load&amp;source=EDT_WIR_NEWSLETTER_0_TRANSPORTATION_ZZ&amp;utm_brand=wired&amp;utm_campaign=aud-dev&amp;utm_mailing=WIR_FastForwardTopClickers%202020-09-07&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=nl&amp;utm_term=WIR_TopClickers_EXCLUDE_Transportation">Wired</a>, I read about geofencing warrants. </p>



<p>Geofence Warrants&nbsp;are a law enforcement practice. Law enforcement submits a request to tech companies, notably Google, Apple, Uber, Facebook, for a list of all the devices in, at, or near a location during a specific period of time. The objective of this practice is to identify people to be interviewed as part of an investigation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Example,</p>



  To identify devices within a few hundred yards to a mile of a murder scene, or accident.   



<p>As of the summer of 2020, this practice is coming under scrutiny, as some have raised privacy concerns about the practice; the practice could cause harm. It could have an adverse effect on individuals’ right to privacy and civil liberties.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, it could be used</p>



  
  to identify people during a protest in violation of the protesters’<a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/">&nbsp;First Amendment rights</a>, i.e. the right to free speech.  in densely populated areas in violation of individuals’&nbsp;<a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-4/">Fourth Amendment rights</a>, namely their right to “secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizure.”  



<p>I’m all for the development of technology and the use of technology to maintain societal safety and democracy, but I do have my concerns. I want to believe that most people and organizations have well-meaning intentions, that they want to create value for people and themselves, but capabilities like geofencing have so many applications that can be used for malign purposes. We need to be careful.</p>



<p>I think it is crucial that we develop a wide range of technology that leverages personal data, like an individual’s location, to generate value for both society and for the individual, but it is imperative that we find ways to ensure individual users of this technology have the ability to maintain their agency and self-sovereignty.  </p>

<p></p><p>Happy Labor Day. While the rest of the world celebrates its labor movements on May Day, America chose its date <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/01/opinion/kohn-labor-day/index.html">to disassociate with a massacre of labor protesters by police</a> in 1886. A further protest in Chicago's Haymarket Square devolved two days later: a bomb was exploded by an unknown person and killed a police officer, and the cops again indiscriminately opened fire. Ultimately, socialists were blamed, as they always are, and the country succumbed to martial law.</p><p>The one country to have not chosen May Day to commemorate what became known as the Haymarket Affair is the one it happened in. The reason we drink beer and eat summer picnic food on Labor Day instead of considering its meaning is not an accident: it was a deliberate choice to bury the past and redirect our energy towards a holiday that celebrates "the dignity of work".</p><p>What insane, radical, unworkable idea were the protesters taking to the streets to advocate? <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/views/2020/05/01/may-day-2020-worker-unity-age-pandemic">It turns out it was the eight hour workday</a> - something we think of as more or less normal today. In the cold light of 2020, it's hard to imagine guns being drawn over a 40-hour workweek.</p><p>Of course, that's how it works: what seemed radical then is normal now. What seems radical now will be completely normal in the future. While Labor Day itself is less a celebration of the labor movement and more a commemoration of an attempt to diffuse it, history shows that it tends to resist that diffusion. The march towards equality is not inevitable, but it has been unstoppable.</p><p>Unions are an important part of that struggle: a counter-balancing force to corporate power that allows workers to organize together and meaningfully negotiate for better working conditions. While not every union is good, the idea of unions is very good. <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/318980/approval-labor-unions-remains-high.aspx">65% of Americans continue to support unions</a>, but <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/265958/percentage-workers-union-members.aspx">only 10% are actually a member of one</a>. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/union-decline-lowers-wages-of-nonunion-workers-the-overlooked-reason-why-wages-are-stuck-and-inequality-is-growing/">the stagnation of worker wages is directly connected to the decline of unions</a>.</p><p>I have no doubt that unions have been intentionally scuppered since at least 1974, when <a href="https://psmag.com/economics/what-caused-the-decline-of-unions-in-america">the Taft-Hartley Act banned sympathy boycotts and made "right to work" laws possible</a>. But they've also been in need of the kind of change and innovation we've seen in other organizations over the last few decades. What does it mean to have a union for a remote workforce? Or for gig workers? And how does the idea of a union change when everyone is connected by the internet and can communicate instantly with one another?</p><p>Kati Sipp's excellent site <a href="http://www.hacktheunion.org/">Hack the Union</a> has been expertly covering these kinds of changes for years. I think it's also time for technologists - particularly open source and decentralization advocates - to think about how their skills could be brought to bear in order to create new kinds of transparent unions.</p><p>Movements like Occupy Wall Street and modern anti-fascists use a headless, non-hierarchical leadership structure rooted in transparency and consensus, making them harder to infiltrate or eradicate. What if unions learned from them and used tools inspired by <a href="https://opencollective.com/">Open Collective</a> to organize dues in the open?</p><p><a href="https://blockchainhub.net/dao-decentralized-autonomous-organization/">Decentralized Autonomous Organizations</a> (DAOs) were created to take this leaderless approach and apply it to new kinds of businesses. Here, a blockchain is used to keep track of "who" is a member (using pseudonymous tokens instead of real-world identities), who can vote, and items put to a vote. Resources can be allocated based on what the organization decides. Instead of leaders, rules are maintained by code.</p><p>While DAOs were built to support a kind of libertarian ideal for business, what if they could be harnessed to support modern unions? The privacy and anonymity of individual members could be maintained while allowing any member to vote. Available resources could be inspected by anybody. There would be little potential for embezzlement and corruption, because of the unbreakable rules governing resource allocation, and membership could be spread organically.</p><p>I'm not a blockchain zealot, and there's no hard need for a potential solution for unions to be decentralized in this way. (Crypto-unions are just one suggestion.) What I think is needed is a conversation about how best to organize in the 21st century, so that the labor movement can continue its good work, so that worker rights can improve, and wages can break free of their stagnation. What's needed is a stronger opposite force to corporate power that allows ordinary working people to once again have a voice. The result will be to break more people out of poverty and create a more equal society for all.</p><p>In the meantime, enjoy your lobster rolls.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Photo from <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/kheelcenter/5278847529">the Kheel Center archive</a>.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

  <p>This week I figured out how to populate Datasette from Airtable, wrote code to generate social media preview card page screenshots using Puppeteer, and made a big breakthrough with my Dogsheep project.</p>
 airtable-export 
<p>I wrote about <a href="https://www.rockybeaches.com/">Rocky Beaches</a> in my weeknotes <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Aug/21/weeknotes-rocky-beaches/">two weeks ago</a>. It's a new website built by Natalie Downe that showcases great places to go rockpooling (tidepooling in American English), mixing in tide data from NOAA and species sighting data from iNaturalist.</p>
<p>Rocky Beaches is powered by Datasette, using a GitHub Actions workflow that builds the site's underlying SQLite database using API calls and YAML data stored in the GitHub repository.</p>
<p>Natalie wanted to use Airtable to maintain the structured data for the site, rather than hand-editing a YAML file. So I built <a href="https://github.com/simonw/airtable-export">airtable-export</a>, a command-line script for sucking down all of the data from an Airtable instance and writing it to disk as YAML or JSON.</p>
<p>You run it like this:</p>
 <code>airtable-export out/ mybaseid table1 table2 --key=key
</code> 
<p>This will create a folder called <code>out/</code> with a <code>.yml</code> file for each of the tables.</p>
<p>Sadly the Airtable API doesn't yet provide a mechanism to list all of the tables in a database (a <a href="https://community.airtable.com/t/list-tables-given-api-key-and-baseid/1173">long-running feature request</a>) so you have to list the tables yourself.</p>
<p>We're now <a href="https://github.com/natbat/rockybeaches/blob/32a010292e7c1ba47db1a86523a61c666d977074/.github/workflows/deploy.yml#L31-L44">running that command</a> as part of the Rocky Beaches build script, and committing the latest version of the YAML file back to the GitHub repo (thus gaining a <a href="https://github.com/natbat/rockybeaches/commits/main/airtable">full change history</a> for that data).</p>
 Social media cards for my TILs 
<p>I really like social media cards - <code>og:image</code> HTML meta attributes for Facebook and <code>twitter:image</code> for Twitter. I wanted them for articles on my <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/">TIL website</a> since I often share those via Twitter.</p>
<p>One catch: my TILs aren't very image heavy. So I decided to generate screenshots of the pages and use those as the 2x1 social media card images.</p>
<p>The best way I know of programatically generating screenshots is to use <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/puppeteer">Puppeteer</a>, a Node.js library for automating a headless instance of the Chrome browser that is maintained by the Chrome DevTools team.</p>
<p>My first attempt was to run Puppeteer in an AWS Lambda function on <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>. I remembered seeing an example of how to do this in the Vercel documentation a few years ago. The example isn't there any more, but I found the <a href="https://github.com/vercel/now-examples/pull/207">original pull request</a> that introduced it.</p>
<p>Since the example was MIT licensed I created my own fork at <a href="https://github.com/simonw/puppeteer-screenshot">simonw/puppeteer-screenshot</a> and updated it to work with the latest Chrome.</p>
<p>It's pretty resource intensive, so I also added a secret <code>?key=</code> mechanism so only my own automation code could call my instance running on Vercel.</p>
<p>I needed to store the generated screenshots somewhere. They're pretty small - on the order of 60KB each - so I decided to store them in my SQLite database itself and use my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-media">datasette-media</a> plugin (see <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Jul/30/fun-binary-data-and-sqlite/">Fun with binary data and SQLite</a>) to serve them up.</p>
<p>This worked! Until it didn't... I ran into a showstopper bug when I realized that the screenshot process relies on the page being live on the site... but when a new article is added it's not live when the build process works, so the generated screenshot <a href="https://github.com/simonw/til/issues/23">is of the 404 page</a>.</p>
<p>So I reworked it to generate the screenshots inside the GitHub Action as part of the build script, using <a href="https://github.com/JarvusInnovations/puppeteer-cli">puppeteer-cli</a>.</p>
<p>My <a href="https://github.com/simonw/til/blob/3fca996228ad54ee433b25840fcd3682e9f7bbfd/generate_screenshots.py">generate_screenshots.py</a> script handles this, by first shelling out to <code>datasette --get</code> to render the HTML for the page, then running <code>puppeteer</code> to generate the screenshot. Relevant code:</p>
 def png_for_path(path):
    # Path is e.g. /til/til/python_debug-click-with-pdb.md
    page_html = str(TMP_PATH / "generate-screenshots-page.html")
    # Use datasette to generate HTML
    proc = subprocess.run(["datasette", ".", "--get", path], capture_output=True)
    open(page_html, "wb").write(proc.stdout)
    # Now use puppeteer screenshot to generate a PNG
    proc2 = subprocess.run(
        [
            "puppeteer",
            "screenshot",
            page_html,
            "--viewport",
            "800x400",
            "--full-page=false",
        ],
        capture_output=True,
    )
    png_bytes = proc2.stdout
    return png_bytes 
<p>This worked great! Except for one thing... the site is hosted on Vercel, and Vercel has a 5MB <a href="https://vercel.com/docs/platform/limits#serverless-function-payload-size-limit">response size limit</a>.</p>
<p>Every time my GitHub build script runs it downloads the previous SQLite database file, so it can avoid regenerating screenshots and HTML for pages that haven't changed.</p>
<p>The addition of the binary screenshots drove the size of the SQLite database over 5MB, so the part of my script that retrieved the previous database <a href="https://github.com/simonw/til/issues/25">no longer worked</a>.</p>
<p>I needed a reliable way to store that 5MB (and probably eventually 10-50MB) database file in between runs of my action.</p>
<p>The best place to put this would be an S3 bucket, but I ind the process of setting up IAM permissions for access to a new bucket so infuriating that I couldn't bring myself to do it.</p>
<p>So... I created a new dedicated GitHub repository, <a href="https://github.com/simonw/til-db">simonw/til-db</a>, and updated my action to store the binary file in that repo - using <a href="https://github.com/simonw/til/blob/1e29c3fe5e90c29b0e71d87dba805484ceb4393c/.github/workflows/build.yml#L80-L86">a force push</a> so the repo doesn't need to maintain unnecessary version history of the binary asset.</p>
<p>This is an abomination of a hack, and it made me cackle a lot. I <a href="https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1301029346614718465">tweeted about it</a> and got the suggestion to try <a href="https://git-lfs.github.com/">Git LFS</a> instead, which would definitely be a more appropriate way to solve this problem.</p>
 Rendering Markdown 
<p>I write my blog entries in Markdown and transform them into HTML before I post them on my blog. Some day I'll teach my blog to render Markdown itself, but so far I've got by through copying and pasting into Markdown tools.</p>
<p>My favourite Markdown flavour is GitHub's, which adds a bunch of useful capabilities - most notably the ability to apply syntax highlighting. GitHub <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/markdown">expose an API</a> that applies their Markdown formatter and returns the resulting HTML.</p>
<p>I built myself <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/tools/render-markdown">a quick and scrappy tool</a> in JavaScript that sends Markdown through their API and then applies a few DOM manipulations to clean up what comes back. It was a nice opportunity to write some modern vanilla JavaScript using <code>fetch()</code>:</p>
  async function render(markdown) {
    return (await fetch('https://api.github.com/markdown', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({'mode': 'markdown', 'text': markdown})
    })).text();
}

const button = document.getElementsByTagName('button')[0];
const output = document.getElementById('output');
const preview = document.getElementById('preview');

button.addEventListener('click', async function() {
    const rendered = await render(input.value);
    output.value = rendered;
    preview.innerHTML = rendered;
});  
 Dogsheep Beta 
<p>My most exciting project this week was getting out the first working version of <a href="https://github.com/dogsheep/beta">Dogsheep Beta</a> - the search engine that ties together results from my <a href="https://dogsheep.github.io/">Dogsheep</a> family of tools for personal analytics.</p>
<p>I'm giving a talk about this tonight at PyCon Australia: <a href="https://2020.pycon.org.au/program/73uk8x/">Build your own data warehouse for personal analytics with SQLite and Datasette</a>. I'll be writing up detailed notes in the next few days, so watch this space.</p>

<p>I've noticed more blog posts on my feeds talking about mental health, and more tweets talking about anxiety in the face of this year's challenges. I'm certainly feeling it too. This week I've been building a contingency plan for what happens if I have to take a leave of absence from work because of my mother's health, which has been an emotionally difficult task on top of an already emotionally challenging context.</p><p>2020 as a whole is a collective trauma. The thing about serious trauma is that it ripples. Its effects are felt in the lives of the people who lived through it; not just as they live through it, but forever. And then it's felt in their children. And finally, in their children.</p><p>My father is one of the youngest survivors of the Japanese concentration camps in Indonesia. He and his older siblings were kept alive by my grandmother. As a 12 year old, my aunt snuck out of the camp and swam through the sewers to find food for them to eat. My grandmother would gather snails and secretly cook them. Around them all - my grandmother, my aunts, my toddler father - was death and brutality. People in the camp were routinely tortured and murdered.</p><p>My grandmother wailed in her sleep every night until the day she died. The trauma certainly affected her children; my father has suffered from its effects in ways that he only became consciously aware of later in life. In turn, his anxieties affected his children - partially through the effect of his actions, but there is also significant evidence that <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/07/parents-emotional-trauma-may-change-their-children-s-biology-studies-mice-show-how">trauma can be passed down epigenetically</a>. My dad is both younger than most of his siblings and had children later in life, but I've seen the effects of this trauma spread to the fourth and fifth generations in my aunts' branches of the family.</p><p>The implications for families that have been split up through draconian immigration policies, or suffered at the hands of trigger-happy police, or been caught by a racist criminal justice system are obvious. The trauma of poverty, too, <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/poverty-linked-to-epigenetic-changes-and-mental-illness-1.19972">creates epigenetic changes that span generations</a>. But during this terrible year, more of us than ever before have seen our relatives die or had our homes destroyed at the hands of natural disasters. We've lived under a kind of fear we thought was a thing of the past.</p><p>So, no wonder we're all feeling kind of terrible. The thing is, it won't just be for the moment. The impact of 2020 - and, yes, I'm afraid to say, 2021 too - is likely to be with many of us for the rest of our lives. If we're not careful, it'll be with our children, too, and their children.</p><p>The good news is that these traumatic effects can be reversed. <a href="https://www.icaad.com/blog/shadows-of-the-past-epigenetics-and-patterns-of-inherited-trauma">Exercise, intense learning, and anti-depressants can help</a>. But that implies that we'll all need systemic help: mental wellness support and a far stronger social safety net. Without this support, the hidden effects of the pandemic (and everything else that's happened this year) may be with us for a very long time to come.</p>

<p>Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) over the time has become a bit of an overloaded term. There are multiple articles, blogs, analyst reports explaining what CIAM is and defining it in different ways. The objective of this blog is to provide my perspective of CIAM in one-line definition.</p><p>Before defining what it is, let’s be clear on why we need to worry about&nbsp;CIAM.</p> Why CIAM? <p>Transforming the customer experience is at the heart of digital transformation. Digital technologies are changing the game of customer interactions, with new rules and possibilities that were unimaginable only a few years back. CIAM is a whole emerging area in the IAM, which is essentially an ingredient for digital customer experience.</p><p>The rest of the blog is based on the above statement. I believe that’s fair enough, and haven’t seen that been questioned much. We can safely assume that’s a well-accepted definition of the objective of CIAM. It might not be in the same words, but still, many who talk about CIAM, share a similar/closer view.</p> Gartner Definition <p>In one of it’s reports Gartner defines CIAM in a lighter way&nbsp;as,</p><p>In my view it’s not strong enough and does not carry enough depth to reach the objective of CIAM. CIAM is more than managing customer identities in a traditional way. It needs to be the facilitator to leverage identity data to catalyze business&nbsp;growth.</p> More CIAM Definitions <p>If you Google, you can find more definitions of CIAM. Not that all of them are wrong, but none of them IMO put enough weight on the objective of CIAM. Here I list few of them. Then again, these are different view points, and none of them are wrong or&nbsp;bad.</p> Customer-focused IAM <p>Rather calling CIAM, managing customer identities, I would like to call it customer-focused IAM. IAM is a well-defined term. As per&nbsp;Gartner,</p><p>The customer-focused IAM adds a lot of depth into the definition of IAM. For example, unlike traditional IAM, when you focus on customers, you probably start working with millions of impatient users, who get annoyed by filling lengthy forms, and cannot wait at least 2 seconds to log into a system. Even a small glitch in your system, they will take it to the social media and will make a big buzz. The slightest of leaked customer information could take a big slice of your share price&nbsp;down.</p><p>Yahoo!, for example, was in the middle of a series of data breaches a few years back, that exposed the PII data of more than 1 billion users. That did cost the company $350 million. They had to lower the sales price of its email and other digital services, which they sold to Verizon from $4.83 billion to $4.48 billion to account for the potential backlash from the data breaches.</p> Beyond Customer-focused IAM <p>Calling CIAM, the customer-focused IAM, still does not add enough weight on the emphasis that it should catalyze business growth. Unlike traditional IAM, a CIAM system should have the capability to integrate with customer relationship management (CRM) systems, marketing platforms, e-commerce platforms, content management systems (CMS), data management platforms and many more. A customer-focused IAM system, with no business integrations adds little value in terms of the business growth that we expect from having a CIAM solution.</p> What CIAM&nbsp;is? <p>Customer-focused IAM does not necessarily mean you only manage customer identities. That’s why I preferred customer-focused IAM instead of managing customer identities. In a typical CIAM solution in addition to direct customers, you also need to manage identities of employees who have direct access to the CIAM solution, or should integrate with an IAM system that manages employee identities. The latter is the preferred option. Also, not all the CIAM solutions are just B2C (business-to-consumer), it can also be B2B (business-to-business) or B2B2C (business-to-business-consumer) as&nbsp;well.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com/what-is-customer-iam-ciam-9f3d74c9632a">What is Customer IAM (CIAM)?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com">FACILELOGIN</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

   I always work across multiple machines and operating systems. I wrote up my laptop choices back in Feb 2020, and I ended up dipping my toes back into Windows with a laptop. Before that, I had bought two Chromebooks in a row, and I still think they are some of the best value.

  <p>I always work across multiple machines and operating systems. I wrote up my <a href="https://blog.bmannconsulting.com/laptop-choices/">laptop choices</a> back in Feb 2020, and I ended up dipping my toes back into Windows with a laptop. Before that, I had bought two Chromebooks in a row, and I still think they are some of the best value.</p>

<p>Ryan recently asked me a question about Chromebooks:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’m thinking of getting my 12 year old a Chromebook for back to school and wanted your input. For context, most of what they’ll be doing is google docs driven and she’s not a gamer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, the Chromebooks are solid. And now that you can put Linux on them as a built in feature, there’s lots more that can be done with it.</p>

<p>You can also game on it: with streaming services like Stadia or Geforce Now, or Steam and some Linux games.</p>

<p>I usually follow the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-chromebook/">Wirecutter recommendations</a> – I have personal experience with buying two ASUS Chromebooks and have been very impressed.</p>

<p>Looks like the <a href="https://www.londondrugs.com/asus-chromebook-flip-c434---touchscreen---14-inch---intel-m3---c434ta-dsm4t/L0568795.html">ASUS Flip C434 is available at London Drugs for $700CAD</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Lenovo-Chromebook-i3-10110U-Processor-82B80006UX/dp/B086383HC7">Lenovo model that is current WireCutter top rating</a> looks to be good and available for about $560CAD.</p>

<p>If you see Chromebooks for less than $500CAD – they are usually way too underpowered.</p>

 

<p>And then Greg emailed me, so I’m turning this whole thing into a little Chromebook FAQ:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We’re wanting/needing to get something for my kids to use for school, and since they use the GSuite at school a Chromebook seems like a good idea. However, they still want to be able to play Minecraft.</p>

<p>Is there a site you would recommend for me to go to, in order to figure out what Chromebook to order? What Chromebook are you running?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Today, you don’t need to “dual boot” into Linux any more. Like WSL for Windows, you run any flavour of Linux that you want and you can run graphical apps like Minecraft no problem. <a href="https://beebom.com/how-install-play-minecraft-chromebook/">This site on installing Minecraft for Chromebooks</a> has too many ads on it, but basically – Linux stuff installs directly on Chromebooks these days.</p>

<p>Having a really solid browser environment, plus basic apps you can install, makes for a good stable system that is very inexpensive for what you get. You need to pay more for a Windows or Mac laptop – approximately 2-4 times the price of a solid Chromebook – to get equivalent performance.</p>

<p>My current Chromebook is the <a href="https://www.asus.com/us/Commercial-Laptops/ASUS-Chromebook-Flip-C434TA/Tech-Specs/">ASUS C434</a>, but as I said at the top, I’m also switching between an ASUS Windows laptop and a Mac desktop.</p>

<p>I still wouldn’t pay more than $1000CAD for a Chromebook (and even that is pretty high).</p>

<!-- use 'smarter' algorithm for cutoff snippet text
   note: summary goes first; than try content -->

   I've identified a pattern for handling potentially-asynchronous callback functions in Python which I'm calling the "await me maybe" pattern. It works by letting you return a value, a callable function that returns a value OR an awaitable function that returns that value. 
 Background 
 Datasette has been built on top of Python 3 asyncio from the very start - initially using Sanic, and as-of Datase

  <p>I've identified a pattern for handling potentially-asynchronous callback functions in Python which I'm calling the "await me maybe" pattern. It works by letting you return a value, a callable function that returns a value OR an awaitable function that returns that value.</p>
 Background 
<p><a href="https://docs.datasette.io/">Datasette</a> has been built on top of Python 3 <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html">asyncio</a> from the very start - initially using <a href="https://sanic.readthedocs.io/">Sanic</a>, and as-of <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-29">Datasette 0.29</a> using a custom mini-framework on top of ASGI 3, usually running under Uvicorn.</p>
<p>Datasette also has a plugin system, built on top of <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pluggy/">Pluggy</a>.</p>
<p>Pluggy is a beautifully designed mechanism for plugins. It works based on decorated functions, which are called at various points by Datasette itself.</p>
<p>A simple plugin that injects a new JavaScript file into a page coud look like this:</p>

 from datasette import hookimpl

@hookimpl
def extra_js_urls():
    return [
        "https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.min.js"
    ] 
<p>Datasette can then gather together all of the extra JavaScript URLs that should be injected into a page by running this code:</p>

 urls = []
for url in pm.hook.extra_js_urls(
    template=template.name,
    datasette=datasette,
):
    urls.extend(url) 
<p>What's up with the <code>template=</code> and <code>datasette=</code> parameters that are passed here?</p>
<p>Pluggy implements a form of dependency injection, where plugin hook functions can optionally list additional parameters that they would like to have access to.</p>
<p>The above simple example didn't need any extra information. But imagine a plugin that only wants to inject jQuery on the <code>table.html</code> template page:</p>

 @hookimpl
def extra_js_urls(template):
    if template == "table.html":
        return [
            "https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.min.js"
        ] 
<p>Datasette actually provides several more optional argument for these plugin functions - see <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/plugin_hooks.html#extra-template-vars-template-database-table-columns-view-name-request-datasette">the plugin hooks documentation</a> for full details.</p>
 What if we need to await something? 
<p>The <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/internals.html#datasette-class">datasette object</a> that can be passed to plugin hooks is special: it provides an object that can be used for the following:</p>
 
 Executing SQL against databases connected to Datasette 
 Looking up Datasette metadata and configuration settings, including plugin configuration 
 Rendering templates using the template environment configured by Datasette 
 Performing checks against the Datasette <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/authentication.html#permissions">permissions system</a> 
 
<p>Here's the problem: many of those methods on Datasette are awaitable - <code>await datasette.render_template(...)</code> for example. But Pluggy is built around regular non-awaitable Python functions.</p>
<p>If my <code>def extra_js_urls()</code> plugin function needs to execute a SQL query to decide what JavaScript to include, it won't be able to - because you can't use <code>await</code> inside a regular Python function.</p>
<p>That's where the "await me maybe" pattern comes in.</p>
<p>The basic idea is that a function can return a value, OR a function-that-returns-a-value, OR an awaitable-function-that-returns-a-value.</p>
<p>If we want our <code>extra_js_urls(datasette)</code> hook to execute a SQL query in order to decide what URLs to return, it can look like this:</p>

 @hookimpl
def extra_js_urls(datasette):
    async def inner():
        db = datasette.get_database()
        results = await db.execute("select url from js_files")
        return [r[0] for r in results]

    return inner 
<p>Note that Python lets you define an <code>async def inner()</code> function inside the body of a regular function, which is what we're doing here.</p>
<p>The code that calls the plugin hook in Datasette can then look like this:</p>

 urls = []
for url in pm.hook.extra_js_urls(
    template=template.name,
    datasette=datasette,
):
    if callable(url):
        url = url()
    if asyncio.iscoroutine(url):
        url = await url
    urls.append(url) 
<p>I use this pattern in a bunch of different places in Datasette, so today I refactored that into <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/blob/26b2922f177caa4e147aaee28be0cff37a457802/datasette/utils/__init__.py#L55-L60">a utility function</a>:</p>

 import asyncio

async def await_me_maybe(value):
    if callable(value):
        value = value()
    if asyncio.iscoroutine(value):
        value = await value
    return value 
<p><a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/commit/26b2922f177caa4e147aaee28be0cff37a457802">This commit</a> includes a bunch of examples where this function is called, for example <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/blob/26b2922f177caa4e147aaee28be0cff37a457802/datasette/app.py#L702-L714">this code</a> which gathers extra body scripts to be included at the bottom of the page:</p>

 body_scripts = []
for extra_script in pm.hook.extra_body_script(
    template=template.name,
    database=context.get("database"),
    table=context.get("table"),
    columns=context.get("columns"),
    view_name=view_name,
    request=request,
    datasette=self,
):
    extra_script = await await_me_maybe(extra_script)
    body_scripts.append(Markup(extra_script))

Just like the product, all these connectors too, are released under the open source Apache 2.0&nbsp;license.</p><p>Identity Server supports passwordless authentication with FIDO 2.0 — and mobile push based authentication with Duo and mePin. Also, we have partnered with Veridium and Aware biometrics to support biometric authentication. In addition to that Identity Server also supports RSA SecurID, TOTP, which you can use with the Google Authenticator mobile app, and then OTP over SMS and&nbsp;Email.</p><p>During a login flow, you can orchestrate between these authenticators by writing an adaptive authentication script in JavaScript. With that you can define how you want to authenticate a user based on environmental attributes (e.g: any HTTP header, geo-location), user attributes / roles (e.g: admins always log with MFA), user behaviors (e.g.: number of failed login attempts, geo-velocity), a risk score and&nbsp;more.</p><p>In the above video, I discuss a set of use cases and show you how you can apply adaptive authentication policies to address advanced authentication requirements.

That’s because harassment and bullying are attempts to exert power over people with less of it.

  <p>I’ve just ordered myself a custom Timbuk2 messenger bag.</p>

<p>Custom? Yes, custom: you pick and choose fabrics and colours and various other options. <a href="https://www.timbuk2.com/pages/customizer#/bag/5009927">This is mine</a>.</p>

<p>I have had a great red/gray reversible messenger bag for many years that my sister Gaby gave me. First one of the inside clips broke so it needed to stay gray, now the outside closing clip broke.</p>

<p>I still use it while walking, but open bag flaps and biking don’t mix.</p>

<p>Asking the Internet about bags is hard, so I went to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/our-favorite-messenger-bags/">Wirecutter and they said Timbuk2</a>.</p>

<p>When I was looking earlier the custom options weren’t as obvious, and I kind of wandered off. Did I want a bag the same as everybody else, especially in drab colours?</p>

<p>Which led me over to <a href="https://www.freitag.ch/en/shop/bags/messenger">Freitag</a>, which my current bag is sometimes confused for.</p>

<p>Colourful, unique, up-cycled bags? Yes! Well, except for two things.
1. Fashion is pricey — about $350CAD before shipping
2. Did I really want to ship up-cycled bags across the ocean?</p>

<p>For a well-made, relatively unique bag that I intend to keep for a decade, price isn’t the barrier.</p>

<p>But (2) got me thinking: can we ship IP rather than products?</p>

<p>Especially as the pandemic has people thinking about supply chains and supporting the local economy, what would it take to collaborate with someone locally in Vancouver and make a bag?</p>

<p>Vancouver has lots of apparel, outer wear, and other gear designers, so that’s a plus.</p>

<p>And in fact, when I asked around and shared the idea a bit, both of the people I talked to had a 1-degree connection to people who had made bags. And then I even found a 1-degree connection of my own who had made his own bag and was making more.</p>

<p>So let’s say I budget $400-$500 for a customer one of a kind bag. Could I find 10 or 12 other people locally who would be interested?</p>

<p>And once I did this, could I make the design (and sourcing of materials and manufacturing/sewing, etc) available for others to do in their local areas?</p>

<p>Yes, I could. And we might just have a little network of locally made goods. Never mind connected links of makers and supporters interested in this sort of thing.</p>

<p>Are you interested in the Vancouver custom bag experiment? Is there another custom thing you’d like to see created locally? Let me know!</p>

<p>More on co-op models and small business peers and shipping IP another time.</p>

   Starting from the north end of Commercial Drive where we live, we did a grand loop and various adventures on the e-bike today. 

 We started at Woodland and Venables, going up Woodland to the 10th Ave bike route and headed west. 

 Federal Store, Quebec at 10th 

  

 First stop was at The Federal Store, on 10th just before Ontario.

  <p>Starting from the north end of Commercial Drive where we live, we did a grand loop and various adventures on the e-bike today.</p>

<p>We started at Woodland and Venables, going up Woodland to the 10th Ave bike route and headed west.</p>

 Federal Store, Quebec at 10th 

<p></p>

<p>First stop was at <a href="https://federalstore.ca/">The Federal Store</a>, on 10th just before Ontario.</p>

<p>Rachael’s tea latte cup had a lovely little stamp. My cappuccino just had “The Federal Store” stamp. Note: The Federal Store has <a href="https://allthebest.recipes/t/johnnys-pops-handmade-popsicles/455">Johnny’s Pops</a> and is open most days until 6pm.</p>

<p>Then headed south on Ontario Street.</p>

 Main at 28th 

<p></p>

<p>Rachael went across the street to <a href="https://allthebest.recipes/t/jasmine-mediterranean-foods-halal-meats/328/2">Jasmine Mediterranean Foods</a> for fresh limit (Turkish bagel) and picked up a few other things.</p>

 Riley Park (Ontario at 30th) 

<p></p>

<p>We lay in the grass at Riley Park. It was a gloriously sunny day, but with a bit of a breeze blowing. We had our coffee &amp; tea drinks with limit and hung out for a bit.</p>

<p>Looking at the map, it seemed like a pretty straight forward route south on Ontario and then east on Kent to the River District, which is a <a href="https://vanmuralfest.ca/festival/riverdistrict">new Van Mural Fest neighbourhood</a>.</p>

<p>Rachael and I have never been down in that area at all, so seemed like a good adventure destination.</p>

 East Kent Avenue 

<p>We drove down Ontario until we hit Marine Drive. We passed by <a href="https://coupland.com/infinite-tire/">Coupland’s Infinite Tire</a> and continued on a couple of blocks into an industrial area and a set of east - west train tracks. There’s a great bike path all along Kent Avenue.</p>

<p>It’s a bit confusing at times which side of the tracks you need to be on. Both are East Kent Avenue, labeled S or N. In some places there is a clearly marked and dedicated bike path, in others you’re going along the road.</p>

 Gladstone-Riverside Park 

<p></p>

<p>We stopped at <a href="https://covapp.vancouver.ca/ParkFinder/ParkDetail.aspx?inparkid=193">Gladstone-Riverside Park</a> – we made it to the Fraser River! Across the river is Richmond, so this is the southern edge of City of Vancouver.</p>

<p>There are a variety of both bike paths and walking paths, again on either a northern “road” path (which had bike paths, too), or a mixed pedestrian - bike path walk ways on parks and green space that is right next to the river. Several other bikers and e-scooters were stopping and looking at maps.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You can see in the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/azNyHaAbyGoNq94w5">map</a> the dotted green paths along the river, as well as East Kent N and S. We stayed on the road (which had a separated two way bike path), as the park paths had a lot of pedestrians.</p>

<p>It was very interesting to see the mix of single family homes but really quite a lot of condos and townhouses either newly built or under construction. This is an area that I know nothing about. It was nice to have bike paths, but it seemed like where we were there was no transit at all, and no retail either. I guess all of that runs along Marine Way.</p>

 River District Murals 

<p>Here’s a <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/euMn3uFswqrU5qAWA">custom Map label for roughly where the murals are</a> (you can see it in the screenshot above on the right hand edge).</p>

<p>It’s in the middle of a ton of construction, and there are detours and fences that will guide you in a loop through the construction. If you’re following audio map directions, they will be very confused and insist that you u-turn :)</p>

<p><a href="https://rachaelashe.com">Rachael</a> did a much better job capturing the murals and artists, so I’ll embed her Instagram here:</p>

<p></p><blockquote>  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CEh-FW8hF4v/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading">                    View this post on Instagram                            </a> <p> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CEh-FW8hF4v/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading">@bmann and I did an epic ride to the River District to see @vanmuralfest murals. A few are finished but most are still works in progress. They are all fantastic. It’s an area we’d never explored before along the Fraser River… . #getoutside #vancouvermuralfestival #vancouvermural #publicart #streetart #vancouverart #yvrart #vanmuralfest #explorevmf</a></p> <p>A post shared by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rachael_ashe/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading"> Rachael Ashe - Paper Artist</a> (@rachael_ashe) on Aug 30, 2020 at 3:48pm PDT</p> </blockquote> <p></p>

<p>The murals are great and many of the artists are at the end of their epic week or so of painting. Apparently they will be up in this temporary space for about a year or so – installed along fencing and the path that detours through the construction site.</p>

<p>The photos I captured below really were about me thinking about this construction and neighbourhood and some of the contrasts.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I asked this artist how they got here, and they said Uber. I continue to have questions about how we’re still building car oriented dense housing in Vancouver.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This and the next murals were along an east-west path, fencing off a construction site with a few abandoned industrial buildings still remaining.</p>

 Rachael looks at an unfinished mural 

<p></p>

<p>The sketched out design looked super cute!</p>

<p></p>

 Overhead Power and Construction 

<p></p>

<p>You see old, original poles, skinny and weathered brown, and the new, larger, treated greenish poles. And this ridiculous jumble of overhead wires that we have all throughout Vancouver. Even in this new area, I guess they’re not burying lines and laying fibre for Internet?!?!?</p>

 Van Mural Fest River District Sign 

<p></p>

<p>Lists all the artists. More discarded building materials and some sort of hangar or industrial building in the fenced off area.</p>

 Looking west, Rachael looks at a mural 

<p></p>

<p>The fence to the north (right in this photo) blocks off rail tracks, then East Kent Ave N, with condos, townhouses going up on the north side of that avenue.</p>

 Blackberries, Barbed Wire, Power, and Construction 

<p></p>

 Kerr Avenue 

<p>After seeing all the murals, it was time to head home. There are a couple of different south / east routes, the most straightforward looked to be heading back along East Kent, and then going north on Kerr Avenue.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Well, it turns out Kerr is an incredibly steep climb from East Kent to Marine Drive, and then keeps going up with Fraserview Golf Course on one side and Everett Crowley Park on the other. The area at the top is called Champlain Heights :)</p>

<p>Anyway, got off the bike and walked it up a good chunk of this. Not enough power for getting both of us up here. There are a couple of epic hills in Vancouver, where a slightly more powerful motor would really help.</p>

<p>We stayed on Kerr until it turns into Rupert next to Killarney Park, then west on East 45th which is a bike route.</p>

<p>Then right and north on Earles Street, crossing Kingsway at the Purdy’s Chocolate factory.</p>

<p>Left and west on Vanness, which turns into BC Parkway path, and a little left along the edge of Slocan Park.</p>

<p>Right and north on Slocan, which is a long down slope. You’ll pass <a href="https://allthebest.recipes/t/banana-grove-market-deli/441">Banana Grove Market</a> at 22nd, and keep going down and north until you hit South Grandview Highway.</p>

<p>Cross that, and you’ll hang a left and be heading west on North Grandview Highway, which is the Central Valley Greenway.</p>

<p>The CVG has been another common route for us, we’ll often head out to Burnaby Lake. But heading home and west we go to Lakewood, and then head right and south until we hit Adanac, and then turn left and west until we’re back at Commercial Drive and home.</p>

<p>We were at one bar of power by the time we made it home, so one of the longest trips we’ve made. Doing a rough map calculation shows about 30km. There are a couple of mega hills in there as well as just long continuous slopes that are rough with two of us on the bike.</p>

 Wesgroup 

<p>At home now, I’m doing a little research on this River District. This is a “planned community” being built by Wesgroup. Here’s <a href="https://wesgroup.ca/news/river-district-is-the-last-waterfront-neighbourhood/">one article</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The River District is located along the Fraser River, just off Marine Way, west of Boundary. It is a brand new, award-winning, master-planned community created by Wesgroup – a Vancouver based builder that has been building in the Lower Mainland for over 50 years. Wesgroup has spent the last decade carefully planning River District, the last waterfront development in the city.
Spanning 130 acres, it is three times the size of Granville Island and will soon become a vibrant destination for living and shopping when complete in 2017…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s now 2020, and there are lots of new homes completed, but as you can see from my photos, lots of new buildings still going up.</p>

<p>Transforming the customer experience is at the heart of digital transformation. Digital technologies are changing the game of customer interactions, with new rules and possibilities that were unimaginable only a few years back. Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) is a whole emerging area in the IAM, which is essentially an ingredient for digital customer experience.</p><p>Today’s increasingly sophisticated consumers now view digital interactions as the primary mechanism for interacting with brands and, consequently, expect deeper online relationships delivered simply and unobtrusively. CIAM turns customer data into Gold! Scalability, Security &amp; Privacy, Usability, Extensibility, and APIs &amp; Integration are the five pillars of CIAM. The following video talks about these five pillars in&nbsp;detail.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com/five-pillars-of-ciam-d5657a9e375b">Five Pillars of CIAM</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com">FACILELOGIN</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The other day I made a
<a href="https://octodon.social/@cwebber/104746037303599668">sadpost on the fediverse</a>
that said: "simultaneously regularly feel like people don't take the
directions I'm trying to push seriously enough and that I'm not worth
taking seriously".
(Similarly, I've also joked that "imposter syndrome and a Cassandra
complex are a hell of a combo" before.)
I got a number of replies from people, both publicly and privately, and
the general summary of most of them are, "We do care!  The stuff you're
working on seems really cool and valuable!  I'll admit that I don't
really know what it is you're talking about but it sounds important!"
(Okay, and I just re-read, and it was only a portion of it that even said
the latter part, but of course, what do I emphasize in my brain?)
That was nice to hear that people care and are enthusiastic, and I did
feel much better, but it did also kind of feel like confirmation that
I'm not getting through to people completely either.</p>
<p>But then <a href="https://mastodon.sdf.org/@jfred">jfred</a> made an
<a href="https://mastodon.sdf.org/@jfred/104747234928467298">interesting reply</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yeah, that feels familiar. Impostor syndrome hits hard. You're
definitely worth taking seriously though, and the projects you're
working on are the most exciting ones I've been following.</p>
<p>As for people not taking the directions you're pushing
seriously... I've felt the same at work, and I think part of it is
that there's only so much one person can do. But also part of it is:
<a href="http://habitatchronicles.com/2004/04/you-cant-tell-people-anything/">http://habitatchronicles.com/2004/04/you-cant-tell-people-anything/</a></p>
<p>...it's hard to get ideas across to someone until they can interact
with it themselves</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So first of all, what a nice post!
Second of all, it's kind of funny that jfred replied with this because
out of everyone, jfred is one of the people who's picked up and
understood what's happening in
<a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblins">Spritely Goblins</a>
in particular the most, often running or creating demos of things on
top of it using things I haven't even documented yet (so definitely
not a person I would say isn't taking me seriously or getting what the
work is doing).</p>
<p>But third, that link to <a href="http://habitatchronicles.com/">Habitat Chronicles</a>
is right on point for a few reasons: first of all, Spritely is hugely
influenced by the various generations of Habitat, from the original
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVpulhO3jyc">first-ever-graphical-virtual-worlds Habitat</a>
(premiering on the Commodore 64 in the mid 1980s, of all things!)
to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNiePoNiyvE">Electric Communities Habitat</a>,
especially because that's where the <a href="http://erights.org/">E programming language</a>
came from, which I think it's safe to say has had a bigger influence on
<a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblins">Spritely Goblins</a> than anything
(except maybe
<a href="http://mumble.net/~jar/pubs/secureos/secureos.html">this paper by Jonathan Rees</a>,
which is the first time I realized that "oh, object capability security
is just normal programming flow").
But also, that blogpost in particular was so perfect about this subject:
<a href="http://habitatchronicles.com/2004/04/you-cant-tell-people-anything/">You can't tell people anything</a>...!</p>
<p>In summary, the blogpost isn't saying that people aren't foolishly
incapable of understanding things, but that people in general don't
understand well by "being explained to".
What helps people understand is experiences:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Eventually people can be educated, but what you have to do is find a
way give them the experience, to put them in the
situation. Sometimes this can only happen by making real the thing
you are describing, but sometimes by dint of clever artifice you can
simulate it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This really congealed for me and helped me feel justified in an
approach I've been taking in the Spritely project.
In general, up until now I've spent most of my time between two
states: coding the backend super-engineering stuff, and coding
demos on top of it.
You might in the meanwhile see me post technobabble onto
<a href="https://octodon.social/@cwebber/">my fediverse</a> or
<a href="https://twitter.com/dustyweb">birdsite</a> accounts, but I'm not in
general trying too hard to write about the structurally interesting
things going on until it comes time to write documentation
(whether it be for <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/goblins/index.html">Goblins</a>,
or the <a href="https://gitlab.com/dustyweb/magenc/blob/master/magenc/scribblings/intro.org">immutable storage</a>
and <a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/crystal/blob/master/crystal/scribblings/intro.org">mutable storage</a> writeups).
But in general, the way that I'm convinced people will get it is not
by talk but by first, demonstration, and second, use.</p>
<p>Aside from the few people that have picked up and played with Goblins
yet, I don't think I've hit a sufficient amount of "use" yet in Spritely.
That's ok, I'm not at that stage yet, and when I am, it'll be fairly clear.
(ETA: one year from now.)
So let's talk about demonstration.</p>
<p>The first demo I wrote was the
<a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/golem/blob/master/README.org">Golem demo</a>,
that showed roughly that distributed but encrypted storage could be
applied to the fediverse.
Cute and cool, and that turned the heads of a few fediverse
implementers.</p>
<p>But let's face it, the best demo I've done yet was the
<a href="https://dustycloud.org/blog/goblins-time-travel-micropreview/">Terminal Phase time travel demo</a>.
And it didn't hurt that it had a cool looking animated GIF to go
with it:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Prior to this demo, people would ask me, "What's this Goblins thing?"
And I'd try to say a number of things to them... "oh, its a
distributed, transactional, quasi-functional distributed programming
system safe to run in mutually suspicious networks that follows object
capability security and the classic actor model in the style of the E
programming language but written in Scheme!"
And I'd watch as their eyes glaze over because
why wouldn't their eyes glaze over after a statement like that, and
then I'd try to explain the individual pieces but I could tell
that the person would be losing interest by then and
why wouldn't they lose interest but even realizing that I'd kind of
feel despair settling in... </p>
<p>But when you show them a pew pew space lasers game and oh wow why
is there time travel, how did you add time travel, is it using
functional reactive programming or something?
(Usually FRP systems are the only other ones where people have
seen these kinds of time travel demos.)
And I'd say nope!
It doesn't require that.
Mostly it looks like writing just straightahead code but you get
this kind of thing for free.
And the person would say, wow!
Sounds really cool!  How much work does it take to add the time
travel into the game?
And I just say: no extra work at all.
I wrote the whole game without testing anything about time travel or
even thinking about it, then later I just threw a few extra lines to
write the UI to expose the time travel part and it just worked.  And
that's when I see peoples' heads explode with wonder and the
connections start to be made about what Goblins might be able to do.</p>
<p>But of course, that's only a partial connection for two reasons.
One is that the time travel demo above only shows off a small,
minute part of the features of Goblins.
And actually, the least interesting of them!
It doesn't show off the distributed programming or asynchronous
programming parts, it doesn't show off the cool object capability
security that's safe to run in mutually suspicious networks.
But still: it gave a taste that something cool is happening here.
Maybe Chris hasn't just been blowing a bunch of time since
finishing the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">ActivityPub</a>
standardization process
<a href="https://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/6785">about two and a half years ago</a>.
(Yikes, two and a half years ago!?!)</p>
<p>To complete the rest of that demonstration of the other things
in the system requires a different kind of demo.
Terminal Phase was a demo to show off the synchronous half of Goblins,
but where Goblins really shines is in the asynchronous, distributed
programming stuff.
That's not ready to show off yet, but I'll give you the first taste
of what's in progress:</p>
<p></p>
<p>(Actually a bit more has progressed since I've recorded that GIF,
multiple chatrooms and etc, but not really worth bothering to show
off quite yet.)</p>
<p>Hmm, that's not really all that thrilling.  A chatroom that looks about
the same level of featureful, maybe less, than IRC?
Well, it could be more exciting if you hear that the
<a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblin-chat/-/blob/94207fd0f3290f8ec6b087cde167bc78a6329560/chat-backend.rkt">full chat protocol implementation</a>
is only about 250 lines of code, including authenticating users and
posts by users.
That's smaller even than its
<a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblin-chat/-/blob/94207fd0f3290f8ec6b087cde167bc78a6329560/goblin-chat-gui.rkt">corresponding GUI code</a>,
which is less than 300 lines of code.
So the exciting thing there is how much heavy lifting Goblins takes
care of for you.</p>
<p>But that's hardly razzle-dazzle exciting.
In order for me to hint at the rest of what's happening here, we need
to put out an asynchronous programming demo that's as or more
interesting than the time travel demo.
And I expect to do that.
I hope soon enough to show off stuff that will make people go,
"Oh, what's going on here?"</p>
<p>But even that doesn't complete the connection for people,
because showing is one thing but to complete the loop, we need
people to use things.
We need to get this stuff in the hands of users to play with and
experiment themselves.
I have plans to do that... and not only that, make this stuff
not intimidating for newcomers.
When Spritely guides everyday people towards extending Spritely from
inside of Spritely as it runs, that's when it'll really click.</p>
<p>And once it clicks sufficiently, it'll no longer become exciting,
because people will just come to expect it.
A good example of that comes from the aforementioned
<a href="http://habitatchronicles.com/2004/04/you-cant-tell-people-anything/">You can't tell people anything</a> article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Years ago, before Lucasfilm, I worked for <a href="http://xanadu.com/">Project Xanadu</a>
(the original hypertext project, way before this newfangled World
Wide Web thing). One of the things I did was travel around the
country trying to evangelize the idea of hypertext. People loved it,
but nobody got it. Nobody. We provided lots of explanation. We had
pictures. We had scenarios, little stories that told what it would
be like. People would ask astonishing questions, like “who’s going
to pay to make all those links?” or “why would anyone want to put
documents online?” Alas, many things really must be experienced to
be understood. We didn’t have much of an experience to deliver to
them though — after all, the whole point of all this evangelizing
was to get people to give us money to pay for developing the
software in the first place! But someone who’s spent even 10 minutes
using the Web would never think to ask some of the questions we got
asked.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eventually, if we succeed, the ideas in Spritely will no longer seem
exciting... because people will have internalized and come to expect
them.
Just like hyperlinks on the web today.</p>
<p>But to get there, in the meanwhile, we have to get people interested.
To become so successful as to be mundane, we have to first be
razzle-dazzle exciting.
And to that end, that's why I take the demo approach to Spritely.
Because it's hard to tell someone something... but showing them,
that's another matter.</p>
<p>PS: It's also not true that people don't get what I'm doing, and
that's even been reflected materially.
I've been lucky to be supported over the last few years from a
combination of
<a href="https://dustycloud.org/blog/samsung-stack-zero-grant/">a grant from Samsung's Stack Zero</a>
and
<a href="https://dustycloud.org/blog/spritely-nlnet-grant/">one from NLNet</a>,
not to mention quite a few <a href="https://www.patreon.com/cwebber">donors on Patreon</a>.
I do recognize and appreciate that people are supporting me.
In some ways receiving this support makes me feel more seriously about the
need to demonstrate and prove that what I'm doing is real.
I hope I am doing and will continue to do a sufficient job, and hope that
the upcoming demos contribute to that more materially!</p>
<p>PPS: If, in the meanwhile, you're already excited, check out
the <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/goblins/index.html">Goblins documentation</a>.
The most exciting stuff is coming in the next major release
(which will be out soon), which is when the distributed programming
tools will be made available to users of the system for the first time.
But if you want to get a head start, the code you'll be writing will
mostly work the same between the distributed and non-distributed
(as in, distributed across computers/processes) asynchronous stuff,
so if you start reading the docs today, most of your code will already
just work on the new stuff once released.
And if you do start playing around, maybe drop by the
<a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=spritely">#spritely channel on freenode</a>
and say hello!</p>

<p>The App Store is a problem.</p><p>As bought into the Apple ecosystem as I am - to be clear, its devices and operating systems are by far the best I've ever used - the way it polices its software ecosystem has become a barrier to innovation.</p><p>I don't really care about Fortnight, and I'm on the fence about whether allowing effectively another App Store inside an App Store is a good idea. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/28/apple-terminates-epic-games-developer-account/">But removing a developer's ability to publish anything on a platform</a>, regardless of whether it breaks the rules or not, seems like a big problem to me. And the rules around payments are worse.</p><p>If your app uses in-app payments of any kind, Apple takes a 30% cut. These payments can only be for virtual goods: you'll notice that if you take a Lyft ride or order a pizza, you'll be redirected to either enter your credit card or use Apple Pay for payment. (Apple takes a 0.15% cut of Apple Pay payments, regardless of the card you use.) The trick is that you can't use this latter method of payment if you could have used in-app payments: if you ask for a credit card for a digital good, but still allow the user to pay in-app, Apple still wants its 30%.</p><p>This is unequivocally digital <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent-seeking">rent-seeking</a>. There's literally no reason for Apple to do this, except to bolster <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/07/apple-app-store-had-estimated-gross-sales-of-50-billion-in-2019.html">the estimated $50B it made last year from the App store</a>. It's one major reason why it's the most valuable company in the world, with a $2.13 trillion market cap as of Friday.</p><p>It's a gatekeeper rather than a driver of innovation. As Francisco Tolmasky pointed out, Apple's App Store rules <a href="https://twitter.com/tolmasky/status/1297199788316692480">wouldn't have allowed for the invention of the web browser</a>. There are likely many other inventions that would have been amazing on mobile and tablet devices that will never see the light of day because they fall afoul of some rule or other.</p><p>Similarly, it's been disheartening to see these rules start to bleed over into macOS. That OS contains a technology - <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491">literally called Gatekeeper</a> - that prevents apps from running unless they're associated with an authorized developer ID. By default, the latest version will only open apps that have been notarized by Apple, which involves some extra software-driven checks in XCode. The only way to run an app that doesn't at least have a developer ID is to open up system preferences and reassure Gatekeeper that it's all going to be okay, on an individual basis - but macOS deliberately doesn't make it clear that you can do this.</p><p>Getting a developer ID costs a flat $99 a year. This heavily excludes developers from less wealthy regions of the world, as well as open source projects. And I strongly suspect that the rules will tighten up again - either formally or through interface changes - in the next version of macOS.</p><p>These are our devices; we bought them. We should be able to run the software we want on them. Anything else is heavily disempowering at best, and a barrier to trade and innovation at worst. And developers like Epic are experiencing firsthand where the chips fall.</p>

<p>Following is the summary of the CIAM maturity model, which I talk about in detail in <a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com/a-maturity-model-for-customer-iam-ef98dcf697de">this</a> blog — and now the question is how we get from level-0 to level-4 or from nonexistent to optimized. That’s where we see the need for a carefully designed integrated supply chain for&nbsp;CIAM.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/supplychain.asp">general</a>, a supply chain is a system of organizations, people, activities, information, and other resources involved in supplying a product or service to a consumer, from the inception to delivery. In the industrial supply chain, we see 5 main&nbsp;phases.</p>Source: <a href="https://thenewstack.io/a-successful-api-strategy-needs-a-digital-supply-chain-and-a-thriving-ecosystem/">https://thenewstack.io/a-successful-api-strategy-needs-a-digital-supply-chain-and-a-thriving-ecosystem/</a><p>Under sourcing you find the raw materials, machinery, labour which you need to build your product. In doing that, you will also find out the suppliers that you need to work with. One of the McKinsey <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/advanced-electronics/our-insights/reimagining-industrial-supply-chains#">reports</a> claims — on average, an auto manufacturer has around 250 tier-one suppliers</p><p>Then during the manufacturing phase you build the product, then distribute it, sell it and finally the consumers start using the&nbsp;product.</p><p>We can build a similar analogy in the digital supply&nbsp;chain.</p><p>If you are building a CIAM solution, then in the discovery phase, you need to figure out what you need to buy and what you need to build. You need not to build everything from&nbsp;scratch.</p><p>Uber for example, uses Google Maps, for navigation. It’s one of the most critical parts of Uber to build a smooth experience for its riders. From 2016 to 2018, Uber <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2019/04/12/uber-ipo-google-maps-goog-investment.html">paid</a> 58M USD to Google for using Google Maps. But, then again it’s a peanut, when you compare that with their revenue in 2019, which was 14.15 billion USD. So, you need to make the right decision and the discovery phase is critical to find out what’s best for&nbsp;you</p><p>In terms of CIAM, during the discovery phase, you need to find out what you want for your IAM system, CRM system, marketing platform, e-commerce platform, fraud detection system, risk engine, CMS, data management platform and so on. For each of these systems, you would need to pick a supplier or vendor. Once again, one of the McKinsey <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/advanced-electronics/our-insights/reimagining-industrial-supply-chains#">reports</a> claims — technology companies have an average of 125 suppliers in their tier-one&nbsp;group.</p><p>Then again you need not to pick everything at once. You can go for a phased approach.</p><p>In the development phase, you start building your CIAM solution, by integrating multiple systems together, which should finally result in the right-level of user experience that would help you to drive the revenue growth by leveraging identity data to acquire and retain customers.</p><p>Then during the deployment phase you need to come up with a model to address some of your non-functional requirements such as scalability, security and so on. Once the system is up and running — you start on-boarding customers. Now you need to start monitoring the customer experience — you need to see how the customers use your product, their pain points, and so on — and then the digital supply chain will continue.</p><p>Then, you go to the next phase, do the discovery based on the services you need, and keep&nbsp;going.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com/the-integrated-supply-chain-for-ciam-de06df281958">The Integrated Supply Chain for CIAM</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com">FACILELOGIN</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

   The first time I ever tried a shakshuka I cooked it from this recipe by J. Kenji López-Alt. It quickly became my favourite breakfast. 
 The only good thing about this pandemic is that I've got to spend more time cooking. I've developed a variant on Kenji's shakshuka that I'm calling a Mexican bean shakshuka. It's delicious. Here's how to make it.

<p>The only good thing about this pandemic is that I've got to spend more time cooking. I've developed a variant on Kenji's shakshuka that I'm calling a Mexican bean shakshuka. It's delicious. Here's how to make it.</p>

<p></p>

 Ingredients 
 
 Red bell pepper, chopped small 
 Medium-sized red onion, chopped small 
 Olive oil (3 tablespoons) 
 4 eggs 
 3 cloves garlic, minced 
 2 cans tomatoes (I use <a href="https://www.muirglen.com/products/fire-roasted-diced-tomatoes/">Muir Glen fire roasted diced tomatoes</a>) 
 Half a can of black beans 
 2 teaspoons cumin 
 1.5 tablespoons paprika 
 Some salt 
 A chipotle pepper in adobo sauce (or half a pepper depending on your spiciness tolerance) - finely chopped 
 
<p>The crucial ingredient here is the chipotle pepper in adobo sauce (I use <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Morena-LA-MOR-CH-24/dp/B0000GGQD4">this La Morena one</a>). If you've never encountered these before they are absolute magic: a total explosion of flavour, and I keep on finding new uses for them (most recently spaghetti bolognese). The can contains 6-8 peppers and I only use one for this recipe (finely chopped) - thankfully once opened it lasts in the fridge for a couple of months.</p>
 Directions 
<p>There are three phases: charring the peppers and onions, cooking the sauce and poaching the eggs. It takes 25-30 minutes total.</p>
 
 Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large frying pan (or cast iron pan) 
 Add the chopped bell pepper and onion 
 Cook without stirring for 6 minutes - the idea is to get the ingredients to char a little 
 Stir once, then cook for another 4 minutes 
 Stir in the minced garlic and cook for 30 seconds 
 Stir in the cumin and paprika 
 Add the two cans of diced tomatoes, half can of black beans and the finely chopped chipotle-in-adobo. Mix well. 
 Simmer for ten minutes, stirring occasionally. 
 Make four equally spaced indentations in the sauce using a large spoon, place an egg in each one, then sprinkle the yolk with some salt 
 Cover with a lid and allow the eggs to poach for six minutes. 
 Serve! 
 
<p><a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/09/shakshuka-north-african-shirred-eggs-tomato-pepper-recipe.html">Kenji's recipe</a> includes photos illustrating how the egg poaching step works.</p>
<p>The great thing about a shakshuka is that it's an incredibly flexible dish. Once you've mastered the basic form it's easy to come up with new tasty variants based around the key idea of poaching eggs directly in the sauce. I sometimes make breakfast "shakshukas" out of leftovers from the night before - bean chiles and Indian curries have worked particularly well for that.</p>

<p>I've been writing at least a post a day during my short social media hiatus. Although I'm a little bit worried about flooding the folks who subscribe via email - it's occurred to me to limit the mailing list to a couple of days a week and send as a digest - I find it meditative. I tend to write first thing in the morning, right after reading through my feeds in <a href="https://reederapp.com/">Reeder</a>. I compose on my iPad in markdown using <a href="https://ia.net/writer">iA Writer</a> and then copy to my site using its "copy as HTML" function. iA Writer uses <a href="https://indieweb.org/Micropub">micropub</a>, so theoretically I could publish directly, but I like the opportunity to read over the piece in context before I push the button.</p><p>As I mentioned on Monday, I've been <a href="https://werd.io/2020/another-day-in-hellsville">writing more fiction</a>, which has mostly meant fleshing out a book in <a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview">Scrivener</a>. I've also been submitting some short stories for publication - my rejection-proof skin has been thickening steadily - and taking part in a few competitions. My round one piece for the <a href="http://www.nycmidnight.com/Competitions/FFC/Challenge.htm">NYC Midnight flash fiction challenge</a> placed first in its group. To be honest, I needed the encouragement - and tonight I'll move on to round two with my head held high.</p><p>I have <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/">an iPad Pro</a> with <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad-keyboards/">a magic keyboard case</a>, which is strictly for creative work. My work accounts are nowhere to be seen, and notifications are switched off across the board. You can't develop software on an iPad - at least, not really - and I don't use it for coding projects. It's just for writing and drawing. While the OS is locked down to the extent that Apple may be legally forced to open it up sometime soon, I find it makes for a pretty good distraction-free environment. It's one of the best gadget purchases I've ever made. (Who would have thought I'd be so bought into the Apple ecosystem a decade ago? Not me.)</p><p>But even more importantly, cultivating the space to write and reflect has been an important habit for me. Like regular exercise and eating well, it sets me up for the rest of the day. In a world where we're expected to be always on and instantly reactive, some nearly-offline slow thinking time has proven to be a very good thing indeed. Getting that in first, over a cup of coffee while the morning is still quiet, has been lovely.</p>

Microtargeting of political messages on social media is theoretically simply a new frontier in political messaging; in reality it has allowed disinformation to be disseminated at scale. The irony is that this kind of behavioral advertising <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/20/dont-be-creepy/">isn't even that lucrative for most businesses</a>; the harms vastly outweigh the benefits.</p><p>This is not a rhetorical discussion. We have concentration camps on our borders, an uptick in hate crimes, and a prevalence of xenophobic, nationalist, and anti-science policies. The climate crisis is being ignored even as our country burns. And we are all responsible.</p>

  <p>This week I built a geospatial search engine for protected areas in California, shipped datasette-graphql 1.0 and started working towards the next milestone for Datasette Cloud.</p>

 California Protected Areas in Datasette 

<p>This weekend I learned about CPAD - the <a href="https://www.calands.org/cpad/">California Protected Areas Database</a>. It's a remarkable GIS dataset maintained by <a href="https://www.greeninfo.org/">GreenInfo Network</a>, an Oakland non-profit and released under a Creative Commons Attribution license.</p>

<p>CPAD is released twice annually as a shapefile. <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Feb/19/shapefile-to-sqlite/">Back in February</a> I built a tool called <a href="https://github.com/simonw/shapefile-to-sqlite">shapefile-to-sqlite</a>  that imports shapefiles into a SQLite or SpatiaLite database, so CPAD represented a great opportunity to put that tool to use.</p>

<p>Here's the result: <a href="https://calands.datasettes.com/">calands.datasettes.com</a></p>

<p>It provides faceted search over the records from CPAD, and uses my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-leaflet-geojson">datasette-leaflet-geojson</a> plugin to render the resulting geometry records on embedded maps.</p>

<p><a href="https://calands.datasettes.com/calands/superunits_with_maps?_search=golden+gate"></a></p>

<p>I'm building and deploying the site using <a href="https://github.com/simonw/calands-datasette/blob/main/.github/workflows/build-and-deploy.yml">this GitHub Actions workflow</a>. It <a href="https://github.com/simonw/calands-datasette/blob/99de39dd80a906f5c1f16724467b0cd55ba4ef36/download.sh#L1">uses conditional-get</a> (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/conditional-get">see here</a>) combined with the GitHub Actions cache to download the shapefiles as part of the workflow run only if the downloadable file has changed.</p>

<p>This project inspired some improvements to the underlying tools:</p>

 
 <code>datasette-leaflet-geojson</code> now <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-leaflet-geojson/issues/12">handles larger polygons</a> and is smarter about <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-leaflet-geojson/issues/14">knowing when to load additional JavaScript and CSS</a> 

 <code>shapefile-to-sqlite</code> can now <a href="https://github.com/simonw/shapefile-to-sqlite/issues/7]">create spatial indexes</a> and has a <a href="https://github.com/simonw/shapefile-to-sqlite/issues/9">new -c option</a> (inspired by <code>csvs-to-sqlite</code>) for extracting specified columns into separate lookup tables 
 

 datasette-graphql 1.0 

<p>I'm trying to get better at releasing 1.0 versions of my software.</p>

<p>For me, the most significant thing about a 1.0 is that it represents a promise to avoid making backwards incompatible releases until a 2.0. And ideally I'd like to avoid ever releasing 2.0s - my perfect project would keep incrementing 1.x dot-releases forever.</p>

<p>Datasette is currently at version 0.48, nearly three years after its first release. I'm actively working towards <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/milestone/7">the 1.0 milestone</a> for it but it may be a while before I get there.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql">datasette-graphql</a> is less than a month old, but I've decided to break my habits and have some conviction in where I've got to. I shipped <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/releases/tag/1.0">datasette-graphql 1.0</a> a few days ago, closely followed by a <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/releases/tag/1.0.1">1.0.1 release</a> with improved documentation.</p>

<p>I'm actually pretty confident that the functionality baked into 1.0 is stable enough to make a commitment to supporting it. It's a <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/blob/1.0.1/README.md">relatively tight feature set</a> which directly maps database tables, filter operations and individual rows to GraphQL. If you want to quickly start trying out GraphQL against data that you can represent in SQLite I think it's a very compelling option.</p>

<p>New <code>datasette-graphql</code> features this week:</p>

 
 Support for multiple reverse foreign key relationships to a single table, e.g. a <code>article</code> table that has <code>created_by</code> and <code>updated_by</code> columns that both reference <code>users</code>. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/blob/main/examples/related_multiple.md">Example</a>. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/issues/32">#32</a> 

 The <code>{% set data = graphql(...) %}</code> template function now accepts an optional <code>variables=</code> parameter. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/issues/54">#54</a> 

 The <code>search:</code> argument is now available for tables that are configured using Datasette's <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/full_text_search.html#configuring-full-text-search-for-a-table-or-view">fts_table mechanism</a>. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/issues/56">#56</a> 

 New example <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/blob/main/examples/fragments.md">demonstrating GraphQL fragments</a>. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/issues/57">#57</a> 

 Added GraphQL execution limits, controlled by the <code>time_limit_ms</code> and <code>num_queries_limit</code> plugin configuration settings. These default to 1000ms total execution time and 100 total SQL queries per GraphQL execution. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/blob/main/README.md#execution-limits">Limits documentation</a>. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/issues/33">#33</a> 
 

 Improvements to my TILs 

<p>My <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/">til.simonwillison.net</a> site provides a search engine and browse engine over the TIL notes I've been accumulating in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/til">simonw/til</a> on GitHub.</p>

<p>The site used to link directly to rendered Markdown in GitHub, but that has some disadvantages: most notably, I can't control the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> tag on that page so it has poor implications for SEO.</p>

<p>This week I switched it over to hosting each TIL as a page directly on the site itself.</p>

<p>The tricky thing to solve here was Markdown rendering. GitHub's Markdown flavour incorporates a bunch of useful extensions for things like embedded tables and code syntax highlighting, and my attempts at recreating the same exact rendering flow using Python's Markdown libraries fell a bit short.</p>

<p>Then I realized that GitHub provide <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/markdown/">an API</a> for rendering Markdown using the same pipeline they use on their own site.</p>

<p>So now the build script for the SQLite database that powers my TILs site <a href="https://github.com/simonw/til/blob/72036ade39616f5551f289e533162ebe726840b0/build_database.py#L46-L90">runs each document through that API</a>, but only if it has changed since the last time the site was built.</p>

<p>I wrote some notes on using their Markdown API in this TIL: <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/til/til/markdown_github-markdown-api.md">Rendering Markdown with the GitHub Markdown API</a>.</p>

<p>Storing the rendered HTML in my database also meant I could finally fix <a href="https://github.com/simonw/til/issues/12">a bug</a> with <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/til/feed.atom">the Atom feed</a> for that site, where advanced Markdown syntax wasn't being correctly rendered in the feed.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-atom">datasette-atom</a> plugin I use to generate the feed applies Mozilla's <a href="https://bleach.readthedocs.io/">Bleach</a> HTML sanitization library to avoid dynamically generated feeds accidentally becoming a vector for XSS. To support the full range of GitHub's Markdown in my feeds I released <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-atom/releases/tag/0.7">version 0.7</a> of the plugin with a deliberately verbose <code>allow_unsafe_html_in_canned_queries</code> plugin setting which can opt canned queries out of the escaping - which should be safe because a <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/sql_queries.html#canned-queries">canned query</a> running against trusted data gives the site author total control over what might make it into the feed.</p>

 Datasette Cloud 

<p>I'm spinning up work again on Datasette Cloud again, after several months running it as a private alpha. My next key milestone is to be able to charge subscribers money - I know from experience that until you're charging people actual money it's very difficult to be confident that you're working on the right things.</p>

<p>While <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/07/americas-health-crisis-is-becoming-a-housing-crisis/614149/">the pandemic certainly accelerated it</a>, the housing crisis in America has been, in large part, <a href="https://rortybomb.wordpress.com/2012/04/06/far-too-low-for-far-too-long-39/">the result of interest rates being held at zero for years</a>.</p><p>I'm far from an economist, but here's my attempt to explain the process:</p><p><a href="https://www.globalance-bank.com/en/themes-and-events/trends/politics/Tiefzinsen-treiben-spekulatives-Verhalten">Low interest rates encourage speculation</a>. It's essentially Santa Claus for investors: loans become incredibly cheap, so they have more net cashflow to deploy on riskier investments in order to pursue higher returns.</p><p>They have a similar effect on the stock market: deliberate changes to interest rates, rather than any kind of natural effect, are one of the main reasons the market has risen steadily for the last few decades. Of course, this stock market performance mostly benefits wealthier people, who then have more capital to deploy on riskier investments.</p><p>Finally, it's worth mentioning that <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/12/inflation-interest-rate-relationship.asp">low interest rates drive higher inflation</a>, reducing the value of the dollar and therefore the real value of the national debt.</p><p>In this environment of increased speculation, <a href="https://voxeu.org/article/housing-speculation-and-its-economic-consequences">investors put more money into housing, and prices are driven up</a>. This is great news for people who already own their own home, who also feel the Santa Claus effect. They receive enormous cash windfalls when they sell their homes, and they can get those low-interest loans using their inflated home values as collateral. But it's an absolute disaster for everyone else.</p><p>As home prices are driven up, it becomes harder and harder for people who aren't already on the ladder to buy in. This is more pronounced in some communities than others: historical racial disparities mean that <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/reports/2019/07/15/469838/racial-disparities-home-appreciation/">people of color are much less likely to own their own home and see the benefit of this appreciation</a>. Across ethnicities, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/06/why-millennials-cant-afford-buy-house/591532/">most younger generations can't afford to buy a home</a>, and those that do <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/annehelenpetersen/millennials-homeowners-mortgage-buying-house-apartment">generally get help from parents already on the property ladder</a>.</p><p>As more people rent, multi-family homes become more valuable investments, which encourages more speculation, and creates more value for people who already have wealth. And so the cycle continues.</p><p>Unfortunately, Bloomberg suggests that <a href="https://www.bloombergquint.com/global-economics/fed-seen-holding-rates-at-zero-for-five-years-plus-in-new-policy">the interest rate may again be held at zero for five or more years</a>. If this happens, we can expect home prices to continue to rise, and this raging inequality to deepen.</p><p>This will also have a profound (and deserved) effect on cities like San Francisco. In a world where remote working is not just accepted but required, and millennial workers can't afford to buy homes in these regions, they're going to find their way to more affordable markets very quickly. People on my team have asked me about the possibility of leaving the San Francisco area, and I'm sure this is a story that's rapidly repeating across the industry. It's impossible to drive through a residential area in San Francisco and not see multiple U-Haul trucks. <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/living-in-sf/article/2020-San-Francisco-exodus-is-real-and-historic-15484785.php">The historic exodus will continue</a>.</p><p>I've got skin in this game. I'm 41 years old and don't own my home. It's beyond time that I had a place of my own - but the Bay Area is looking like a worse and worse place to settle. I want to live in a diverse, progressive community where people across multiple industries and lifestyles can afford to live. That's going to be somewhere much cheaper.</p><p>I had hoped that we'd see some housing price depreciation, but it looks like policies will go the other way, regardless of who is the President next year. We've all got to prepare accordingly.</p>

<p>I’ve been spending a lot of time thinking about and drilling into the nature of personal information. I’ve been thinking about its role within society, and how we can find a risk-reward equilibrium (i.e., The Identity Nexus®) when it comes to the exchange of personal information between public institutions, private organizations, and people (i.e., data subjects).</p>



<p>To make this exercise manageable, I landed on three critical cornerstones that we should all consider to equitably manage and exchange personal information, namely privacy, security, and compliance.</p>



 Personal Information Management Cornerstones 



<p>The three cornerstones of personal information management are,</p>



  Privacy, the ability for a data subject to have agency over their phygital self, that is the ability to control the who, what, when, where, for how long, and for what purpose any entity can access and use their physical or digital self (aka personal information), or capital assets (i.e. the physical asset or any data produced by those assets, such as a connected car, house, clothes, phone, pet, etc.)  Security, the technologies and processes that ensure only authorized people, systems or services, etc. can access an individual’s physical and digital self or capital assets.   Compliance, the rules, the policies, the rights, and governance models that we all technologically and socially agree to follow when it comes to personal information management (e.g. collection, storage, aggregation, refinement, dissemination, exchange, valuation, etc.), and the punishment if any of these rules, policies, rights, and governance models are not followed or are breached.   



<p>I’ll write more on each of these cornerstones later, but I wanted to take a moment to talk about compliance briefly. </p>



 Personal Information Management Compliance 



<p>Without effective personal information management compliance, there will be little chance of achieving The Identity Nexus. People and their data will be “legally” abused (more than they are now), criminals will run amuck, and there will be a total loss of trust. We’ll be facing chaos, anarchy. </p>



<p>Regulations are an important and key element of personal information management compliance. Personal information management regulations are the society and industry laws and policies we all agree to and/or are subjected to to give people rights to their data and the guardrails we put on organizations’ to ensure that they properly steward people’s data.</p>



<p>For those whose job it is to write and manage regulations, wrapping one’s head around the nuances of all the personal information management regulations can be quite a challenge, and for the laymen, it can be nearly impossible. Luckily, we have organizations like the <a href="https://iapp.org">Intonational Association of Privacy Professionals</a> that does yeoman’s work in helping their members and the industry at large navigate the personal information regulatory landscape. </p>



 IAPP US State Comprehensive Privacy Law Comparison 



<p>On July 7, 2020, the IAPP released an update to its <a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/state-comparison-table/">US state comprehensive privacy law comparison</a>, a matrix that evaluates the personal information management regulations in the works across the states. The matrix lists the stage each relevant privacy legislative effort is in within a given state, and the eight most common rights each law affords individuals and the eight obligations that organizations must adhere to (see the image below).</p>



 People’s personal information management rights 



  Right of access  Right of rectification  Right of deletion (aka right to be forgotten)  Right of restrictions  Right of portability  Right of opt-out  Right against automated decision making  Private right of actions  



 Organization’s obligations toward personal information stewardship 



  Strict age opt-in or opt-out or the prohibition on the sale of information   Notice/transparency requirement  Data breach notification  Risk assessments  Prohibition on discrimination when exercising rights  Purpose limitations  Processing limitations  Fiduciary duty  



<p>It is essential for every one of us to study and understand how these laws can benefit us personally and how they may affect our businesses, now and in the future. With this understanding we can then strive to find the equilibrium state for the flows of personal information within society, we can find The Identity Nexus. That is we can ensure that there is an equality of value exchange to risk amongst all those participating throughout the personal information management economy.</p>

 In the US, you normally have to be an accredited investor to invest in private companies like startups. In practice, this has meant that you've needed to earn $200K a year for the last two years running, or have a net worth of at least a million dollars excluding the value of your home.

In practice, this has meant that you've needed to earn $200K a year for the last two years running, or have a net worth of at least a million dollars excluding the value of your home. It's not quite as simple as this: <a href="https://www.sec.gov/smallbusiness/exemptofferings/regcrowdfunding">some crowdfunding</a> has been allowed for a while, and if a startup is raising under a million dollars, <a href="https://www.cooleygo.com/can-you-raise-money-from-unaccredited-investors/">it could include non-accredited investors under some circumstances</a>. Nonetheless, the effective rule has been: only rich people can buy into startups.</p><p><a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/peirce-accredited-investor-2020-08-26">The SEC announced an expansion to that definition today</a>. As an alternative to being rich, you can also be considered to be accredited if you've achieved Series 7, 65, or 82 certification. These exam-based certifications respectively qualify you to sell securities, provide general investment advice, or transact securities on behalf of clients.</p><p><a href="https://www.nasaa.org/exams/exam-faqs/">Taking a Series 65 exam costs $175.</a> It wouldn't surprise me if investment platforms started subsidizing that price in order to make it easier for individuals to invest in startups, making back the total from a cut in investment proceeds.</p><p>Of course, <a href="https://www.financialsamurai.com/just-say-no-to-angel-investing/">investing in startups is eye-wateringly risky</a>, and nobody should ever invest more money than they can comfortably lose. Nonetheless, for many investors from less high net worth backgrounds, the barrier to getting into the market has been lowered. Particularly for women founders and founders from communities of color, this may be a good thing. (Increased speculation, on the other hand, may not be.)</p>

  <p>Summary:      If your identity system doesn't use DIDs and verifiable credentials in a way that gives participants autonomy and freedom from intervening administrative authorities, then it's not SSI.</p>


<a></a>
 

A few days ago I was in a conversation with a couple of my <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/who-are-the-identerati">identerati</a> friends. When one used the term "SSI", the other asked him to define it since there were so many systems that were claiming to be SSI and yet were seemingly different. That's a fair question. So I thought I'd write down my definition in hopes of stimulating some conversation around the topic. 
<p></p>

<p>
    I think we've arrived at a place where it's possible to define SSI and get broad consensus about it. SSI stands for self-sovereign identity, but that's not really helpful since people have different ideas about what "sovereign" means and what "identity" means. So, rather than try to go down those rabbit holes, let's just stick with "SSI."1
</p>

<p>
    SSI has the following properties:
</p>
 
     SSI systems use <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/02/decentralized_identifiers.shtml">decentralized identifiers</a> (DIDs) to identify people, organizations, and things. Decentralized identifiers provide a cryptograhic basis for the system and can be employed so that they don't require a central administrative system to manage and control the identifiers. Exchanging DIDs is how participants in SSI create <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/authentic_digital_relationships.shtml">relationships</a>, a critical feature. 
     

     SSI participants use <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/12/verifiable_credential_exchange.shtml">verifiable credentials exchange</a> to share information (attributes) with each other to strengthen or enrich relationships. The system provides the means of establishing <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/10/fidelity_provenance_and_trust.shtml">credential fidelity</a>. 
     

     SSI supports <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/cogito_ergo_sum.shtml">autonomy for participants</a>. The real value proposition of SSI is autonomy—not being inside someone else's administrative system where they make the rules in a one sided way. Autonomy implies that participants interact as peers in the system. You can build systems that use DIDs and verifiable credentials without giving participants autonomy. 
     
 

<p>
    Beyond these there are lots of choices system architects are making. Debates rage about how specifically credential exchange should work, whether distributed ledgers are necessary, and, if so, how should they be employed. But if you don't use DIDs and verifiable credentials in a way that gives participants autonomy and freedom from intervening administrative authorities, then you're not doing SSI.
</p>

<p>
    As a consequence of these properties, participants in SSI systems use some kind of software agent (typically called a wallet for individuals) to create relationships and exchange credentials. They don't typically see or manage keys or passwords. And there's no artifact called an "identity." The primary artifacts are relationships and credentials. The user experience involves managing these artifacts to share attributes within relationships via credential exchange. This user experience should be common to all SSI systems, although the user interface and what happens under the covers might be different between SSI systems or vendors on those systems.
</p>

<p>
    I'm hopeful that, as we work more on interoperability, the implementation differences will fade away so that we have a single identity metasystem where participants have <a>choice about tools and vendors</a>. An identity metasystem is <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/08/youve_had_an_automobile_accident_multi-source_identity_to_the_rescue.shtml">flexible enough to support the various ad hoc scenarios that the world presents us</a> and will support <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/08/life-like_identity_why_the_internet_needs_an_identity_metasystem.shtml">digital interactions that are life-like</a>. 
</p>


 

 Notes 
 
     This is not to say I don't have opinions on what those words mean in this context. I've written about "sovereign" in <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/cogito_ergo_sum.shtml">Cogito, Ergo Sum</a>, <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2016/10/on_sovereignty.shtml">On Sovereignty</a>, and <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/10/self_sovereign_is_not_self_asserted.shtml">Self Sovereign is Not Self Asserted</a>.

 I used to have a simple ethical stance that influenced my career choices: I wouldn't work for a defense or arms company, and I wouldn't work for a bank.

<p>I used to have a simple ethical stance that influenced my career choices: I wouldn't work for a defense or arms company, and I wouldn't work for a bank.</p><p>In both cases, the idea was that I didn't want my work to result in someone's death. For defense or weapons, the connection to death is obvious. For banks, my argument was that traditional banking institutions work in a predatory way that actively harms people in poverty, worsening their situation at best, and exploiting it at worst.</p><p>While I stand by both lines, this stance is a little too simple. What about challenger banks, for example? Particularly those which seek to upend the status quo and provide real help for people who need it? What about other technology companies that provide essential technology platforms that are used to profile immigrants or activists? What about companies that further - or simply choose to ignore - gaping racial disparities?</p><p>My computer science degree taught me many things. I learned how to diagram finite state automata like nobody's business; I've got a pretty good handle on how to analyze the cost effectiveness of an algorithm; I got my head around Prolog, C, Java, and XSLT. While I believe we learned about ethical considerations around artificial intelligence - the trolley problem, for example - I don't recall being taught about the ethics of our own actions.</p><p>Over the last few years, it's become a more accepted idea that software is the reflection of the people who build it: engineering, product, and business decisions are all made by humans who use their own value systems and understanding of their ethical context. <a href="https://ethicalos.org/">Omidyar Network's Ethical OS</a> is one response to this challenge, allowing organizations to make better decisions as they build products. <a href="https://www.humanetech.com/">The Center for Humane Technology</a> has, to its credit, also been refining its approach to advocating for ethics, having launched amidst some <a href="https://librarianshipwreck.wordpress.com/2018/02/13/be-wary-of-silicon-valleys-guilty-conscience-on-the-center-for-humane-technology/">deserved criticism</a>. These endeavors, as well as the work of inclusion-minded organizations like <a href="http://www.code2040.org/">Code2040</a>, <a href="https://www.womenwhocode.com/">Women Who Code</a>, <a href="https://techqueria.org/">Techqueria</a>, <a href="https://www.transhack.org/">Trans*H4ck</a> and others, represent a great deal of progress. Of course, there's significantly more progress that still needs to be made.</p><p>But there are relatively few resources centered around making ethical decisions as an individual. How might you choose your next job in an ethical way? What kind of work should an engineer - or a product manager, designer, marketer, etc - feel comfortable doing? What are the codes of ethics we should live by and look for among our peers?</p><p>Ethics is, of course, a widespread area of study, and there are plenty of endeavors outside of tech to figure out how to apply them. Santa Clara University's Markkula Center for Applied Ethics hosts <a href="https://www.scu.edu/ethics/ethics-resources/ethical-decision-making/a-framework-for-ethical-decision-making/">a framework for considering ethical decisions</a> that is probably a good starting point. But I've found very little that dives specifically into the ethical challenges for individuals posed by building software on the internet. Not only do you need a framework for asking the right questions, which the Markkula Center's work helps provide, but you need to have the insight and knowledge to truly understand the implications of your work.</p><p>A few years ago, Chelsea Manning attended the New York demo day for Matter, the values-based accelerator where I was Director of Investments. She was on the board for Rewire, a startup that was attempting to build an easy-to-use encrypted email solution for journalists and activists. We had worked hard to select teams that we believed had the potential to make the world more informed, inclusive, and empathetic. Chelsea is very smart indeed, and doesn't hold her opinions back; I was eager to get her feedback on the teams.</p><p>It was a shock to me when she explained which technologies could be used for surveillance, which could be used for weapons, and so on. The teams were absolutely not building technology for those use cases, but at the hands of the wrong investors or acquirers, they could be used to cause harm. She was right. While we had invested in some genuinely incredible people, I realized I hadn't done enough to discuss the implications of the work the teams were doing and ensure that it was impossible for them to cause harm in the wrong hands. Intention is not enough. I consider this to be one of the most important conversations of my life.</p><p>A similar conversation might be enlightening for engineers who build facial recognition software <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/07/08/739491857/ice-uses-facial-recognition-to-sift-state-drivers-license-records-researchers-sa">that is used by ICE to scan DMV records to build a corpus of data that can be used to track immigrants</a>. Or those who build <a href="https://sevenpillarsinstitute.org/fintech-payday-lending-the-case-of-wonga/">modern payday loans that plunge low income people into debt traps</a>. Or <a href="https://www.globest.com/2019/06/25/ai-screening-more-accurately-determines-high-risk-renters/">machine learning algorithms that predict "high risk renters"</a>, locking in historic racial disparities. Or engineers who find themselves agreeing with <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-pernicious-science-of-james-damores-google-memo/">James Damore's outrageous Google memo</a>. And we need to be having these conversations more openly, so that we can improve understanding and share knowledge and insights that will help everyone in the industry make better decisions.</p><p>Ethical challenges are subjective and non-deterministic, and it's difficult to build a hard and fast framework that encompasses them - which is a hard pill to swallow for engineers, who are used to living in a deterministic universe built out of discrete logic and testable outcomes. My "don't build weapons, don't work for a bank" rules simply don't cut it. It's tempting to reduce my stance to a pat motto like "do no harm", but like its obvious cousin "do no evil", too much wiggle room is left for work that could have less than positive implications.</p><p>There's no alternative to assessing each opportunity on its own terms and asking the right ethical questions, although we can help each other by making those assessments public and learning from each other. We need to be doing that for everything we assess, from job opportunities to business models to technology architectures. Technology is not amoral; neither is business. And we all have a responsibility to do the right thing.</p>

<p>The following letter from a group of UK parliamentarians rings alarm bells that should awaken all of us – I suspect similar things are happening in the shadows well beyond the borders of the United Kingdom…</p>
<p>The letter recounts the sad story of one more politician with no need for science or expertise – for him, rigorous attention to what systems do to data protection and privacy can simply be dismissed as “bureaucracy”.&nbsp; Here we see a man in over his head – evidently unaware that failure to follow operational procedures protecting security and privacy introduces great risk and undermines both public trust and national security.&nbsp; I sincerely hope Mr. Hancock brings in some advisors who have paid their dues and know how this type of shortcut wastes precious time and introduces weakness into our technical infrastructure at a time when cyberattack by organized crime and nation states should get politicians to sober up and get on the case.</p>

<p>Dear Elizabeth Denham,</p>
<p>We are writing to you about the Government’s approach to data protection and privacy during the COVID-19 pandemic, and also the ICO’s approach to ensuring the Government is held to account.<br>
During the crisis, the Government has paid scant regard to both privacy concerns and data protection duties. It has engaged private contractors with problematic reputations to process personal data, as highlighted by <a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/opendemocracyuk/it-started-as-1-now-its-1-million-wheres-the-mandate-for-letting-palantir-into-our-nhs/">Open Democracy and Foxglove</a>. It has built a data store of unproven benefit. It chose to build a contact tracing proximity App that centralised and stored more data than was necessary, without sufficient safeguards, as <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/1284/documents/11453/default/">highlighted by the Human Rights Committee</a>. On releasing the App for trial, it failed to notify yourselves in advance of its Data Protection Impact Assessment – a fact <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/oralevidence/334/html/">you highlighted</a> to the <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/1037/documents/8502/default/">Human Rights Committee</a>.</p>
<p>Most recently, the Government has admitted breaching their data protection obligations by failing to conduct an impact assessment prior to the launch of their Test and Trace programme. They have only acknowledged this failing in the face of a threat of legal action by <a href="https://www.openrightsgroup.org/app/uploads/2020/07/200715-PAP-Response-Letter.pdf">Open Rights Group</a>.The Government have highlighted your role at every turn, citing you as an advisor looking at the detail of their work, and using you to justify their actions.</p>
<p>On Monday 20 July, Matt Hancock indicated his disregard for data protection safeguards, saying to Parliament that “I will not be held back by bureaucracy” and claiming, against the stated position of the Government’s own legal service, that three DPIAs covered “all of the necessary”.</p>
<p>In this context, Parliamentarians and the public need to be able to rely on the Regulator. However, the Government not only appears unwilling to understand its legal duties, it also seems to lack any sense that it needs your advice, except as a shield against criticism.<br>
Regarding Test and Trace, it is imperative that you take action to establish public confidence – a trusted system is critical to protecting public health. The ICO has p<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12/part/6/crossheading/information-notices/enacted">owers to compel documents to understand data processing, contractual relations and the like (Information Notices</a>). The ICO has powers to assess <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12/part/6/crossheading/assessment-notices/enacted">what needs to change</a> (Assessment Notices). The ICO can demand particular changes are made (Enforcement notices).&nbsp; Ultimately the I<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12/part/6/crossheading/enforcement-notices/enacted">CO has powers to fin</a>e Government, if it fails to adhere to the standards which the ICO is responsible for upholding.</p>
<p>ICO action is urgently required for Parliament and the public to have confidence that their data is being treated safely and legally, in the current COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.</p>

<p>事後報告ですが、金融庁と日本経済新聞の共催の『Fin/Sum | BG2C 2020』に出演しました。本来は3月に行う予定だったものですが、新型コロナ禍により延期になっていたものです。</p>



<p>会場は東京は日本橋のコレド室町テラス３階の「室町三井ホール＆カンファレンス」で、座席はありましたが、ソーシャルディスタンスを撮っておりましたし、参加人数的にはちょっと寂しい感じで、麻生大臣はビデオメッセージ、その他の登壇者も多くはリモートという形でした。</p>



    ビデオ出演の麻生大臣  キーノートのメインホールの様子  モデレータの佐古早稲田大学教授j以外はリモート参加  松尾ジョージタウン大学教授はこのために来日、２週間の隔離生活  ルーム２はこんな感じ  珍しく日本のパネリストのみのパネル  <a></a><a></a><a></a>   



<p>わたしのセッションは、11:20からのBG2Cの一環としての「ブロックチェーンとアイデンティティ」というパネルディスカッションでした。モデレータのわたしだけが部屋にいて、登壇者の</p>



  <a>アイリーン・ヘルナンデス</a><br>GATACA<br>創業者 兼 CEO  <a>マリア・ヴァッチーノ</a><br>Easy Dynamics Corp.<br>ディレクター  <a>キム・キャメロン</a><br>Convergence Tech<br>チーフアイデンティティオフィサー<br>www.identityblog.comモデレーター  



<p>は、当然のことながら、それぞれ、スペイン、アメリカ、カナダからのリモート参加です。アイリーンは午前３時２０分からというすごい時間帯でしたが、ビシッと服装も整えておしゃれして出てくれました。もちろん、マリアもです。総じて海外パネリストは男性陣は髪ボサボサに対して女性陣はビシッとしてた感じがします。</p>



<p>しかし、こういうリモートのパネルはやっぱり心臓に悪いですね。リモート側の音が会場ではリバーブがかかりすぎてよく聞こえなかったりなど、コンディションが良くないですし、それ以前に、ちゃんとコールインしてくれるか、その時の回線は大丈夫か、などいろいろ不安要素があります。</p>



<p>そんなこんなで、自分のセッションのスクショとか取るの忘れてしまいました。主催者からそのうち写真や録音が出てくるのではないかと期待して…。</p>



<p>なお、Fin/Sum | BG2C では、他に２つのアンカンファレンスセッションにも出て、そのうち一つではファシリテーターをやらせていただきました。リモートのアンカンファレンスもなかなかおもしろい経験でした。</p>

<p>I host a <a href="https://forum.dgov.foundation/c/weekly-dgov-calls">weekly call on distributed governance</a>. This blog provides my personal opinions but by all means view the <a href="https://youtu.be/Rb_HzFjBj4A">entire discussion here</a>&nbsp;.</p><p>One of the big debates in the Genesis DAO started by DAOstack was the question of anonymity. Should people be able to make proposals and ask for budgets without providing a real identity?</p><p>Part of the problem was a structural problem with DAOstack at the time: there was no escrow system. You could allocate funds to a project, but you could not hold the funds until the project was complete. In other words, everyone was paid up front for their project as soon as the group approved&nbsp;it.</p><p>Another aspect of the problem was human: we all feel a little weird chatting with someone faceless. On the discussion boards, one person could potentially have multiple pseudonyms. If we were discussing something controversial, it would be fairly easy for someone to pretend to be multiple people arguing for or against the proposal. It was also fairly easy to troll the system anonymously. It wasn’t as easy to game the voting, though it was certainly possible.</p> It Ain’t&nbsp;Real <p>The example of the Genesis DAO was somewhat trivial, because it was a small number of people who actually did know one another. None of the anonymous people seriously asked for budget (though there was an anonymous troll), the amounts of money in question weren’t huge, and it was a small enough community that everyone pretty much knew one&nbsp;another.</p><p>In real life, identity is fundamental to democracy. It amazes me how many people cherish their anonymity so much that this is under debate. <a href="https://forum.dgov.foundation/c/weekly-dgov-calls">Our weekly chat</a> about anonymity was wide-ranging, and as usual, we came to the conclusion that “it depends.”</p> Does It Really&nbsp;Depend? <p>Personally, I think it doesn’t depend on the situation at all. At almost all stages of governance, you need to know some information about the person. You almost never need to know their actual name, but you almost always need to know, at a minimum, whether they have the right to influence a particular situation.</p><p>My minimum viable values statement about governance is: If the decision will impact you, you should have the ability to influence the decision. How much influence you should have is a different question. For example, if you are not an expert on hydroelectric dams, maybe you don’t get to decide where to build the dam, but if you live near the river, your perspective should be taken into&nbsp;account.</p><p>This isn’t the way democracy runs today. Corporations make decisions that impact their workers, customers and the environment with no regard for their opinions. Governments determine foreign policy without having any responsibility for the citizens of foreign countries who will be impacted by those policies. Lawmakers in one state make laws that influence neighboring states. We call that democracy. I digress but it’s important. We are completely normalized to a situation in which, as long as we feel fairly treated inside our organization, the external people’s feelings are irrelevant to what we call fair&nbsp;process.</p> What’s in a&nbsp;Name? <p>Throughout most of the decision-making process, therefore, full anonymity is not appropriate. Knowing people’s name isn’t particularly important, but in each stage of the process, some identifying information is helpful to democracy.</p>  In discussions and sentiment signalling, you need to know a person’s affiliation and expertise. Are they a resident? Do they work for the solar panel company? Are they an expert in urban planning? Is the electric company going to make a bid to buy up their land if this project is approved? Did they educate themselves and read multiple perspectives on the issue at hand? In the best of cases, you would also show an indicator of their reputation in the domains being discussed.  In problem definition, you need to know the person’s sentiment and perspective on the issue as well as something about their cognitive abilities. Are they good at detail or systems-wide analysis? Can they integrate multiple perspectives and listen well to others? Does the makeup of the problem-definition team appropriately represent enough different perspectives on the problem? Are they good at asking deeper questions, or do you use a highly-facilitated problem-definition process?  For proposal-making, while it is often optimal to let everyone propose ideas, it’s equally important to have the right experts in the room. Is this person an electrician or architect? Have they done other successful projects in this specific area? Again, the best ideas might come from someone who doesn’t have the proper background, but the process of solidifying the proposal needs to be grounded in&nbsp;reality.  For voting you need to know that this is the individual they said they were, and that they are voting in accordance with the rules of the voting&nbsp;system.  For execution of the decision, you need to know the qualifications of the people carrying out the&nbsp;work.  For accountability, oversight and assessment of the process, you need to know the qualifications and the vested interests of the&nbsp;people.  Finally, for whistle-blowing, you need some level of anonymity but you may also need verifiable evidence. Throughout the entire process, there needs to be some mechanism for people to give feedback safely when their own self-interest might be endangered. Scientists at a chemical company are the best qualified to expose if there might be unpublished side-effects to some new product. If there are good enough privacy and anonymity controls, such information could be leaked more transparently while verifying the reliability of the&nbsp;sources.   Collapsing reality and&nbsp;desire <p>One of the reasons people clamor for anonymity is that the tech collapses our identity and name and private data. Identity isn’t just your name. All of your data doesn’t have to be identified in every transaction — collapsing these concepts is sloppy and leads people to think there are only two possibilities: complete anonymity and complete exposure.</p><p>Identifying yourself by your name is the easiest way for people to eliminate anonymity, but it exposes more information than is necessary. I think that most of the debate over anonymity is due to the fact that we haven’t found creative ways to de-couple someone’s actual name from other attributes about&nbsp;them.</p><p>Technically, it would be possible to create a system where someone has a different name to different people. I would look at all of Alice’s posts and develop an opinion of her. You might be looking at Andrea’s posts — not knowing that Andrea and Alice were actually the same person, but anonymized so that when we met this person in real life, let’s say it’s really Alexa, we wouldn’t be able to attribute that information to her unless she wanted us to. She might appear differently on different forums, because she’s more of an expert in oceanography than in architecture. That’s an extreme implementation, but it’s just one example of how technology can be used to provide us the information we need to form opinions online without compromising someone’s identity.</p><p>As soon as we recognize that we can develop solutions for allowing different levels of participation and providing the data we need without exposing something sensitive, we can start to have a conversation about the need for anonymity in specific situations.</p><p>Enjoy our <a href="https://youtu.be/Rb_HzFjBj4A">talk about anonymity and democracy</a>. Most people don’t agree with me on the call! Feel free to join us. We have new topics every week, and <a href="https://forum.dgov.foundation/c/weekly-dgov-calls">the call is open to&nbsp;all</a>.</p>

Around the world, activists fighting for equality and democracy need the same.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Bridgefy app <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2019/09/04/hong-kong-protesters-are-using-this-mesh-messaging-app--but-should-they-trust-it/#3438798d18b4">that was widely used in the Hong Kong protests</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2020/08/bridgefy-the-app-promoted-for-mass-protests-is-a-privacy-disaster/">has been shown to be a privacy nightmare</a>: easy to take down, compromise, and deanonymize. Choosing the wrong tool can have consequences. So what's safe?</p><p>Open source software allows anyone to view and share the source code. It can be audited by anyone who wants to verify that it is seucre and fit for purpose. The result is applications that are more trustworthy.</p><p>Here are a few auditable, open source tools that I believe activists can rely on.</p> <a href="https://signal.org/en/">Signal</a> <p>Easy to use and end-to-end encrypted, Signal is recommended by both Edward Snowden and security guru Bruce Schneier. It behaves like a slick instant messaging app you might download from Google or Facebook, but you know your messages are end-to-end encrypted.</p><p>I use Signal every day to communicate with people all over the world. It just works.</p><p>It's worth saying that <a href="https://signal.org/blog/whatsapp-complete/">while the Signal protocol is also used to secure WhatsApp messages</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@gzanon/no-end-to-end-encryption-does-not-prevent-facebook-from-accessing-whatsapp-chats-d7c6508731b2">it is technically possible for messages saved on that app to be shared with Facebook, its corporate parent</a>. They can also be technically shared with governments and law enforcement.</p> <a href="https://element.io/">Element</a> <p>While Signal is best at one-to-one communication, Element is a bit like an open source, end-to-end encrypted Slack. Based on <a href="https://matrix.org/">the decentralized Matrix network</a>, which can theoretically support an infinite number of different apps, it combines a commercial quality user experience with fully open source code, a decentralized back-end, and end-to-end encryption.</p><p>Like Slack, it can be extended using bots and integrations. For example, an upload to a&nbsp; SecureDrop endpoint could notify an Element channel (or a channel on any other Matrix-powered app). In the same way Slack can be turned into a notification center for commerical teams, Element or Matrix can be used to be an activist group's control center. And it runs behind Tor.</p> <a href="https://securedrop.org/">SecureDrop</a> <p>Created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz">Aaron Swartz</a> and currently managed by <a href="https://freedom.press/">the Freedom of the Press Foundation</a>, SecureDrop allows any organization to securely and anonymously accept documents.</p><p>Organizations like The New York Times, the anti-corruption NGO Global Witness, and the Center for Public Integrity run SecureDrop instances on their own infrastructure to maintain the safety and anonymity of whistleblowers. Any organization can do the same.</p> <a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a> <p>The InterPlanetary File System is a censorship-resistant way to publish content on the internet without having to rely on a central provider. When used with the Tor Browser, it's anonymous, too.</p><p>IPFS's distributed architecture allows content to be published without easily being removed. Content is hosted by other IPFS users. Unlike the web, there's no central DNS registry, so domains can't be pulled down. And content at one IPFS location can easily be forked and copied to another.</p><p><a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/usage-ideas-examples/">A growing number of end-user IPFS apps are available</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor Browser</a> <p>Tor is the most secure way to browse the web. It blocks trackers and prevents <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/internetcitizen/2018/07/26/this-is-your-digital-fingerprint/">browser fingerprinting</a>: the process by which tracking networks can identify you by your browser configuration alone, whether you have cookies enabled or not.</p><p>Most importantly, though, it uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(anonymity_network)">Tor network</a>, which is designed to anonymize your internet traffic. (TOR stands for The Onion Router, and its anonymous architecture is built in layers, like an onion.) There are lots of sites that only exist on the network, and these "dark web" nodes aren't as rife with criminality as reports suggest. DuckDuckGo operates a Tor node; so does everything from Medium to Facebook. In every case, it's to establish greater security for users around the world.</p><p>Tor allowed protesters in the Arab Spring to escape censorship or retaliation, and is used to bypass China's Great Firewall. It can do the same for today's protesters. Chrome and Firefox users in free countries <a href="https://snowflake.torproject.org/">can download the Snowflake plugin</a> to help host layers of the Tor network without implicating yourself.</p> <a href="https://bitmask.net/en">Bitmask</a> <p>Bitmask is a cross-platform VPN built specifically for activists. Most people use a VPN to create a secure connection to protected infrastructure: for example, to access production servers. Some commercial VPNs are designed to allow people to access streaming services in other countries. In both cases, anti-surveillance isn't the goal; they tend to have centralized architectures where traffic travels through servers monitored and controlled by a single company.</p><p>Conversely, Bitmask gives you access to multiple networks designed to circumvent surveillance and network monitoring. Its parent, the <a href="https://leap.se/">LEAP Encryption Access Project</a>, wants to provide high quality encryption to everyone. (<a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/27/trump-officials-weigh-encryption-crackdown-1385306">The Trump administration has considered banning end-to-end encryption</a>.)</p> What else? <p>This list is a starting point: I'd love to hear about other software you think should be included. If you're aware of an open source, easy to use, cross-device encrypted email solution, I would particularly like to know - mostly so I can switch to it immediately.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@xteemu?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Teemu Paananen</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/protest?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p>

 There are 20 pages of requests for multiple discounts for Shopify to be able to apply free shipping. 

 The way to do it without a plugin, is to add a new rate, label it “Free Shipping”, and set the conditions to only apply when the min and max are both $0.

<p>There are <a href="https://community.shopify.com/c/Shopify-Discussion/Apply-discount-together-with-free-shipping/td-p/453890">20 pages of requests for multiple discounts for Shopify to be able to apply free shipping</a>.</p>

<p>The way to do it without a plugin, is to add a new rate, label it “Free Shipping”, and set the conditions to only apply when the min and max are both $0.</p>

<p>Any other paid shipping options will still display – and be selectable by the customer! – but obviously they can just pick free shipping and there won’t be a charge.</p>

<p>So to give a “free” item to someone, make a dollar value discount code of the price of the item, so that the cost is zero, and then this free shipping rate will appear. Note: if you are dealing with multiple currencies, sometimes the conversion means that your dollar value discount code makes it not quite $0. You’ll need to experiment and set a discount $ value appropriately.</p>

<p>Many readers will already know that I retired from Microsoft after twenty years working as Chief Architect of Identity and other related roles. I had a great time there, and Microsoft adopted the Laws of Identity in 2005 at a time when most tech companies were still under dark influence of “Privacy is Dead”, building systems destined to crash at endless cost into a privacy-enabled future. Microsoft is a big complicated place, but Bill Gates and Satya Nadella were as passionate as me about moving Microsoft and the industry towards digital identity respectful of the rights of individuals and able to empower both individuals and organizations.  I thank them and all my wonderful colleagues and friends for a really great ride. </p>
<p>In the last years I led Microsoft to support Decentralized Identity as the best way to recognize the needs and rights of individual people, as well as the way to move enterprises and governments past the security problems, privacy roadblocks and dead ends that had resulted from the backend systems of the last century.  Truly exciting, but I needed more time for my personal life.</p>
<p>I love being completely in control of my time, but my interest in digital identity is a keen as ever. So besides working with a small startup in Toronto called Convergence Tech on exciting innovation around Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized Identity, I’ve decided to start blogging again.  I will, as always, attempt to dissuade those responsible for the most egregious assaults on the Laws of Identity.  Beyond that, I share my thoughts on developments in the world of Decentralized Identity and technology that enfranchises the individual person so each of us can play our role in a democratic and secure digital future.</p>

<p>Cloud security is about much more than security functionality. The top cloud providers all seem to have a capable suite of security features and most surveyed organizations report that they see all the top cloud platforms as generally secure. So, why do 92% of surveyed organizations still <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/cloud-threat-report/">report</a> a cloud security readiness gap? They’re not comfortable with the security implications of moving workloads to cloud even if they believe it’s a secure environment and even if the platform offers a robust set of security features.&nbsp;</p><p>Two contributing factors to that gap include:</p>  78% reported that cloud requires different security than on-prem. With security skills at a shortage, the ability to quickly ramp up on a new architecture and a new set of security capabilities can certainly slow progress.<br>  Only 8% of respondents claimed to fully understand the cloud security shared responsibilities model; they don’t even know what they’re responsible for; never mind how to implement the right policies and procedures, hire the right people, or find the right security technologies.  <p>I recently posted about how Oracle is addressing the gap  on the <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/cloudsecurity/dao-research-examines-how-oracle-is-addressing-the-cloud-security-readiness-gap">Oracle Cloud Security blog</a>. There's a link in the post to a new whitepaper from Dao Research that evaluates the cloud security capabilities offered by Amazon AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.</p><p>Oracle took some criticism for arriving late to the game with our cloud infrastructure offering. But, several years of significant investments are paying off. Dao's research concludes that “Oracle has an edge over Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, as it provides a more centralized security configuration and posture management, as well as more automated enforcement of security practices at no additional cost. This allows OCI customers to enhance overall security without requiring additional manual effort, as is the case with AWS, Azure, and GCP.”<br></p><p>A key take-away for me is that sometimes, the competitive edge in security in delivered through simplicity and ease of use. We've <a href="https://www.schneier.com/news/archives/2012/12/complexity_the_worst.html">heard</a> over and over for several years that complexity is the enemy of security. If we can remove human error, bake-in security by default, and automate security wherever possible, then the system will be more secure than if we're relying on human effort to properly configure and maintain the system and its security.<br></p><p><a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/cloudsecurity/dao-research-examines-how-oracle-is-addressing-the-cloud-security-readiness-gap">Click here to check out the post and the Dao Research whitepaper</a>.<br></p>

<p>I've decided to take a short hiatus from social media - which, really, is a hiatus from learning about the world in staccato, where each dopamine hit brings a payload of horror. I want to be informed, but I want to be informed on my schedule.</p><p>I'm writing this update from Santa Rosa, which sits nestled between two raging fires. The smoke hangs thickly in the air, turning the sky red. This year seems to ratchet up month by month, the pressure slowly increasing, as if to dare us to cry that we've had enough.</p><p>Here is what my day in the pandemic looked like:</p><p>I brought an air purifier to an elderly friend in Berkeley. Then I brought a second air purifier to my sister in Richmond, who is disabled with chronic pain and spends most of her day in bed. I drove myself through the orange haze to be with my parents. My mother is weaker than she's probably ever been. She can barely walk. I made dinner for them both, and washed up, and gave her a ginger hug in bed and told her I hoped tomorrow would be a better day.</p><p>It's a lot.</p><p>I'm finding it really difficult to work on extracurricular coding in this context, so I've given up. Known is chugging along without me, which is lovely to see, and it turns out that my Life on the Ground questions don't need a software platform to empower people to share their stories. I work with code and software in my day job, and that turns out to be more than enough.</p><p>Instead, I'm writing a book. Finally. It's a pandemic cliché, I'm fully aware of it, but it's also something I've been called towards for decades. I've decided to approach it with the seriousness I would any software project: I'm learning new skills and researching the best approaches. It's not a whim - but it's also liberating to work on something that doesn't need to be a business. More than anything, it's something that's mine: an escape, a place to channel all the things I'm feeling, and something to work on that doesn't need to be about productivity. It can just be. Not a venture novel; a lifestyle novel.</p><p>There are silver linings to this pandemic. Remote work means I can support my parents without having to consider the impact on my job. I've found the mental and actual space to write. Not going into an office means I haven't been eating trash from the neighborhood for lunch, and I've been able to use some of the extra time to exercise. I'm healthier than I've been in years.</p><p>I just wish we weren't in the midst of an epidemic, and that California wasn't on fire, and that we had a compassionate government, and that police weren't murdering Black people, and that my mother wasn't dying.</p><p>Some of these things will change. The epidemic will end. The fires will be put out, and we will eventually enact laws to deal with the climate crisis. The government will leave office, and potentially go to jail. The police will be defunded and remade.</p><p>As for the last thing on the list? All I can do is be here, do my best, try and remember to take care of myself, and hope.</p>

<p>Back in 2019, the <a href="http://www.datumfuture.org">Datum Future</a> and <a href="http://www.globalwebindex.com">GlobalWebindex</a> released a study, <a href="https://www.datumfuture.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Data-Confidence-Index-Datum-Future-and-GWI-2019.pdf">The Data Confidence Index</a>. This study is as relevant today as when it was released. According to Catherine Mayer of Datum Future, with this study, they set out to explore the differences between people’s privacy attitudes and their privacy protection behaviors.</p>



<blockquote><p>The Data Confidence Index is a measure of expressed privacy concerns against online privacy behaviours</p></blockquote>



<p>When calculating the data confidence index, the researchers assessed people’s attitudes toward data usage and safety across three privacy concerns: 1) concerns related to how companies use data, 2) concerns about the Internet eroding privacy, and 3) the desire for anonymity online. The authors then indexed these privacy concerns against five privacy protection behaviors, 1) deleting cookies, 2) using a private browser, 3) using an ad-blocker, and 4) VPN use to stay anonymous online and for hiding browser activity.</p>



 The Findings 



<p>The following figure shows the index across 41 countries with 0 representing the people with the most confidence in their ability to engage in privacy protecting-behaviors that are in line with their privacy concerns, and 2.0 representing those with the least confidence to do so; the study suggests that the Taiwanese are the least confident and the Swedes are the most confident about their data.</p>



    



 Discussion 



<p>This is a valuable study. It helps us better understand people’s privacy concerns in relation to their behaviors, and it can be useful for understanding market personas and for targeting specific countries with privacy-enhancing technologies.</p>



 Study limitations 



<p>The study, however, does have its limitations. The authors point out that individual cultures, demographics, and experiences influence people’s privacy attitudes and behaviors. Moreover, attitudes towards privacy and related behaviors are impacted by a country’s collectivist or individualist orientation, with individualist cultures expecting individuals to take more responsibility for themselves, while collectivist cultures look to society, e.g. government, to do so. In addition, the level of Internet penetration in a country and the extent to which digital behaviors are more tightly aligned to social and media behaviors vs. lifestyle activities, like communications and paying the bills, are important to consider. All these factors may play a role in privacy attitudes and behaviors but are not taken into consideration by the researchers in this study.</p>



 Other privacy protection behaviors to consider 



<p>In addition to the limitations above, I’d like to add one of my own. The study only looks at five privacy protection behaviors; however, there are many <a href="https://identitypraxis.com/2019/04/27/youre-being-scored-what-it-means-for-your-privacy/">other considerations and behaviors</a> that users can and should engage in if they truly want to take control of their data and privacy.</p>



<p>A summary of just a few of the leading privacy-protecting behaviors, including those above, are,</p>



  Using an independent cross-platform password manager, and most importantly not reusing usernames and passwords across accounts, or sharing passwords  Sharing an alias name, provide false data, when appropriate  Limit information sharing on social media and in other apps  Employing an identity aliasing tools, such as email, credit card, and phone number aliasing solution  Installing a tracker manager (aka ad-blocker)  Turning on and using MFA (multi-factor authentication) on accounts  Activating and keeping current anti-virus on computers and mobile devices: block viruses, malware, ransomware, phishing  Installing and using anti-keylogger software on your computer  Installation and using Webcam blocker software, or take the easier route and put on and use a webam cover  Private, “safe”, browser (NOT incognito mode)  Enabling mobile SIM card protection with a PIN code  Installing and keeping current an Internet network monitoring solution  Using a VPN whenever connected to a public WiFi network  Monitoring credit scores and accounts  Subscribing to a darknet monitoring service  Using services like Apple Pay and Google Pay  Communicating through encrypted messaging or email apps  Having identity insurance and access to fraud restoration services  Enacting regulatory rights and asking companies for a copy of their data  Being wary of phishing and other common fraud, never giving out sensitive information  Reading terms &amp; conditions and privacy policies before signing up for a service or downloading and installing apps  Use anonymous payment methods  Delete or cancel unused social media and other accounts  Cancel or don’t go through with a transaction if the site or vendor does not “feel” trustworthy  Change default privacy settings on a device or application  Validate tax information on file at <a href="http://www.ssa.gov">www.ssa.gov</a>  Keeping an eye out for the emergence of personal information management solutions (more on this later in future articles)  



<p>These are just a handful of the many behaviors that people can engage in to safely and securely navigate the Internet and build their data confidence and peace-of-mind.</p>



<p>In summary, there is so much more we can do. When looking at the data confidence index, only 2 of 41 countries are generally confident the vast majority of people of moderate to high concerns.</p>



 Study Methodology 



<p>The study is based on GlobalWebIndex’s data from the Q1 – Q4 2018 research waves among a sample of 391,130 internet users aged 16 – 64 across 41 markets in which GlobalWebIndex tracks online privacy behaviors.</p>

<p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://shorensteincenter.org/new-digital-realities/">New Digital Realities; New Oversight Solutions</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Wheeler">Tom Wheeler</a>, <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=Phil+Verveer">Phil Verveer</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Kimmelman">Gene Kimmelman</a>&nbsp;suggest that “the problems in dealing with digital platform companies” strip the gears of antitrust and other industrial era regulatory machines, and that what we need instead is “a new approach to regulation that replaces industrial era regulation with a new more agile regulatory model better suited for the dynamism of the digital era.” For that they suggest “a new Digital Platform Agency should be created with a new, agile approach to oversight built on risk management rather than micromanagement.” They provide lots of good reasons for this, which you can read in depth <a href="https://shorensteincenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/New-Digital-Realities_Aug-2020.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>I’m on a list where this is being argued. One of those participating is Richard Shockey, who often cites his eponymous law, which says, “The answer is money. What is the question?” I bring that up as background for my own post on the list, which I’ll share here:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Digital Platform Agency proposal seems to obey a law like Shockey’s that instead says, “The answer is policy. What is the question?”</p>
<p>I think it will help, before we apply that law, to look at modern platforms as something newer than new. Nascent. Larval. Embryonic. Primitive. Epiphenomenal.</p>
<p>It’s not hard to think of them that way if we take a long view on digital life.</p>
<p>Start with this question: is digital tech ever going away?</p>
<p>Whether yes or no, how long will digital tech be with us, mothering boundless inventions and necessities? Centuries? Millenia?</p>
<p>And how long have we had it so far? A few decades? Hell, Facebook and Twitter have only been with us since the late ’00s.</p>
<p>So why start to regulate what can be done with those companies from now on, right now?</p>
<p>I mean, what if platforms are just castles—headquarters of modern duchies and principalities?</p>
<p>Remember when we thought IBM, AT&amp;T and the PTTs in Europe would own and run the world forever?</p>
<p>Remember when the BUNCH was around, and we called IBM “the environment?” Remember EBCDIC?</p>
<p>Remember when Microsoft ruled the world, and we thought they had to be broken up?</p>
<p>Remember when Kodak owned photography, and thought their enemy was Fuji?</p>
<p>Remember when recorded music had to be played by rolls of paper, lengths of tape, or on spinning discs and disks?</p>
<p>Remember when “social media” was a thing, and all the world’s gossip happened on Facebook and Twitter?</p>
<p>Then consider the possibility that all the dominant platforms of today are mortally vulnerable to obsolescence, to collapse under their own weight, or both.</p>
<p>Nay, the certainty.</p>
<p>Every now is a future then, every is a was. And trees don’t grow to the sky.</p>
<p>It’s an easy bet that every platform today is as sure to be succeeded as were stone tablets by paper, scribes by movable type, letterpress by offset, and all of it by xerography, ink jet, laser printing and whatever comes next.</p>
<p>Sure, we do need regulation. But we also need faith in the mortality of every technology that dominates the world at any moment in history, and in the march of progress and obsolescence.</p>
<p>Another thought: if the only answer is policy, the problem is the question.</p></blockquote>
<p>This suggests yet another another law (really an aphorism, but whatever): “The answer is obsolescence. What is the question?”</p>
<p>As it happens, I wrote about Facebook’s odds for obsolescence two years ago <a href="https://medium.com/@dsearls/the-human-solution-to-facebooks-machine-produced-problems-also-won-t-work-3364656bc257">here</a>. An excerpt:</p>
<blockquote><p>How easy do you think it is for Facebook to change: to respond positively to market and regulatory pressures?</p>
<p>Consider this possibility:&nbsp;it can’t.</p>
<p>One reason is structural. Facebook is comprised of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.quora.com/How-many-data-centers-does-Facebook-have-and-where-are-they-located">many data centers</a>, each the size of a Walmart or few, scattered around the world and costing many $billions to build and maintain. Those data centers maintain a vast and closed habitat where more than two billion human beings share all kinds of revealing personal shit about themselves and each other, while providing countless ways for anybody on Earth, at any budget level, to micro-target ads at highly characterized human targets, using up to millions of different combinations of targeting characteristics (including ones provided by parties outside Facebook, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Analytica">Cambridge Analytica</a>, which have deep psychological profiles of millions of Facebook members). Hey, what could go wrong?</p>
<p>In three words,&nbsp;the whole thing.</p>
<p>The other reason is operational. We can see that in how Facebook has handed fixing what’s wrong with it over to thousands of human beings, all hired to do&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-worst-job-in-technology-staring-at-human-depravity-to-keep-it-off-facebook-1514398398">what&nbsp;The Wall Street Journal&nbsp;calls</a>&nbsp;“The Worst Job in Technology: Staring at Human Depravity to Keep It Off Facebook.” Note that this is not the job of robots, AI, ML or any of the other forms of computing magic you’d like to think Facebook would be good at. Alas, even Facebook is still a long way from teaching machines to know what’s unconscionable. And can’t in the long run, because machines don’t have a conscience, much less an able one.</p>
<p>You know Goethe’s (or hell, Disney’s) story of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sorcerer%27s_Apprentice">The Sorceror’s Apprentice</a>? Look it up. It’ll help. Because Mark Zuckerberg is both the the sorcerer&nbsp;and&nbsp;the apprentice in the Facebook version of the story. Worse, Zuck doesn’t have the mastery level of either one.</p>
<p>Nobody,&nbsp;not even Zuck, has enough power to control the evil spirits released by giant machines designed to violate personal privacy, produce echo chambers beyond counting, amplify tribal prejudices (including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/world/asia/myanmar-government-facebook-rohingya.html">genocidal ones</a>) and produce many $billions for itself in an advertising business that depends on all of that—while also trying to correct, while they are doing what they were designed to do, the massively complex and settled infrastructural systems that make all if it work.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m not saying regulators should do nothing. I am saying that gravity still works, the mighty still fall, and these are facts of nature it will help regulators to take into account.</p>

   California Protected Areas Database in Datasette 
 I built this yesterday: it's a Datasette interface on top of the CPAD 2020 GIS database of protected areas in California maintained by GreenInfo Network. This was a useful excuse to build a GitHub Actions flow that builds a SpatiaLite database using my shapefile-to-sqlite tool, and I fixed a few bugs in my datasette-leaflet-geojson plugin as well.

  <p>This week I helped Natalie launch <a href="https://www.rockybeaches.com/">Rocky Beaches</a>, shipped Datasette 0.48 and several releases of <code>datasette-graphql</code>, upgraded the CSRF protection for <code>datasette-upload-csvs</code> and figured out how to get a commit log of changes to my blog by backing up its database to a GitHub repository.</p>
 Rocky Beaches 
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/natbat">Natalie</a> released the first version of <a href="https://www.rockybeaches.com/">rockybeaches.com</a> this week. It's a site that helps you find places to go tidepooling (known as rockpooling in the UK) and figure out the best times to go based on low tide times.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I helped out with the backend for the site, mainly as an excuse to further explore the idea of using Datasette to power full websites (previously explored with <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2019/Nov/25/niche-museums/">Niche Museums</a> and <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Apr/20/self-rewriting-readme/">my TILs</a>).</p>
<p>The site uses a pattern I've been really enjoying: it's essentially a static dynamic site. Pages are dynamically rendered by Datasette using Jinja templates and a SQLite database, but the database itself is treated as a static asset: it's built at deploy time by <a href="https://github.com/natbat/rockybeaches/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml">this GitHub Actions workflow</a> and deployed (currently to <a href="https://www.vercel.com/">Vercel</a>) as a binary asset along with the code.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/natbat/rockybeaches/blob/main/scripts/build.sh">build script</a> uses <a href="https://github.com/simonw/yaml-to-sqlite">yaml-to-sqlite</a> to load two YAML files - <a href="https://github.com/natbat/rockybeaches/blob/4127c0f0539178664cefed4aca00db2b5c00c855/data/places.yml">places.yml</a> and <a href="https://github.com/natbat/rockybeaches/blob/4127c0f0539178664cefed4aca00db2b5c00c855/data/stations.yml">stations.yml</a> - and create the <code>stations</code> and <code>places</code> database tables.</p>
<p>It then runs two custom Python scripts to fetch relevant data for those places from <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/">iNaturalist</a> and the <a href="https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/web_services_info.html">NOAA Tides &amp; Currents API</a>.</p>
<p>The data all ends up in the Datasette instance that powers the site - you can browse it at <a href="http://www.rockybeaches.com/data">www.rockybeaches.com/data</a> or interact with it using GraphQL API at <a href="http://www.rockybeaches.com/graphql">www.rockybeaches.com/graphql</a></p>
<p>The code is a little convoluted at the moment - I'm still iterating towards the best patterns for building websites like this using Datasette - but I'm very pleased with the productivity and performance that this approach produced.</p>
 Datasette 0.48 
<p>Highlights from <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-48">Datasette 0.48</a> release notes:</p>
 
 Datasette documentation now lives at <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/">docs.datasette.io</a> 
 The <code>extra_template_vars</code>, <code>extra_css_urls</code>, <code>extra_js_urls</code> and <code>extra_body_script</code> plugin hooks now all accept the same arguments. See <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/plugin_hooks.html#plugin-hook-extra-template-vars">extra_template_vars(template, database, table, columns, view_name, request, datasette)</a> for details. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/939">#939</a>) 
 Those hooks now accept a new <code>columns</code> argument detailing the table columns that will be rendered on that page. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/938">#938</a>) 
 
<p>I released a new version of <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-cluster-map">datasette-cluster-map</a> that takes advantage of the new <code>columns</code> argument to only inject Leaflet maps JavaScript onto the page if the table being rendered includes latitude and longitude columns - previously the plugin would load extra code on pages that weren't going to render a map at all. That's now running on <a href="https://global-power-plants.datasettes.com/">https://global-power-plants.datasettes.com/</a>.</p>
 datasette-graphql 
<p>Using <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql">datasette-graphql</a> for Rocky Beaches inspired me to add two new features:</p>
 
 A new <code>graphql()</code> Jinja custom template function that lets you execute custom GraphQL queries inside a Datasette template page - which turns out to be a pretty elegant way for the template to load exactly the data that it needs in order to render the page. Here's <a href="https://github.com/natbat/rockybeaches/blob/70039f18b3d3823a4f069deca513e950a3aaba4f/templates/row-data-places.html#L29-L46">how Rocky Beaches uses that</a>. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/issues/50">Issue 50</a>. 
 Some of the iNaturalist data that Rocky Beaches uses is stored as JSON data in text columns in SQLite - mainly because I was too lazy to model it out as tables. This was coming out of the GraphQL API as strings-containing-JSON, so I added a <code>json_columns</code> plugin configuration mechanism for turning those into Graphene <code>GenericScalar</code> fields - see <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/issues/53">issue 53</a> for details. 
 
<p>I also landed a big performance improvement. The plugin works by introspecting the database and generating a GraphQL schema that represents those tables, columns and views. For tables with a lot of tables this can get expensive, and the introspection was being run on every request.</p>
<p>I didn't want to require a server restart any time the schema changed, so I didn't want to cache the schema in-memory. Ideally it would be cached but the cache would become invalid any time the schema itself changed.</p>
<p>It turns out SQLite has a mechanism for this: the <code>PRAGMA schema_version</code> statement, which returns an integer version number that changes any time the underlying schema is changed (e.g. a table is added or modified).</p>
<p>I built a quick <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-schema-versions">datasette-schema-versions</a> plugin to try this feature out (in less than twenty minutes thanks to my <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Jun/20/cookiecutter-plugins/">datasette-plugin cookiecutter template</a>) and prove to myself that it works. Then I built a caching mechanism for <code>datasette-graphql</code> that uses the current <code>schema_version</code> as the cache key. See <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/issues/51">issue 51</a> for details.</p>
 asgi-csrf and datasette-upload-csvs 
<p><a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-upload-csvs">datasette-upload-csvs</a> is a Datasette plugin that adds a form for uploading CSV files and converting them to SQLite tables.</p>
<p>Datasette 0.44 <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/changelog.html#csrf-protection">added CSRF protection</a>, which broke the plugin. I fixed that this week, but it took some extra work because file uploads use the <code>multipart/form-data</code> HTTP mechanism and my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/asgi-csrf">asgi-csrf</a> library didn't support that.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://github.com/simonw/asgi-csrf/issues/1">fixed that</a> this week, but the code was quite complicated. Since <code>asgi-csrf</code> is a security library I decided to aim for 100% code coverage, the first time I've done that for one of my projects.</p>
<p>I got there with the help of codecov.io and <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pytest-cov/">pytest-cov</a>. I wrote up what I learned about those tools in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/til/blob/main/pytest/pytest-code-coverage.md">a TIL</a>.</p>
 Backing up my blog database to a GitHub repository 
<p>I really like keeping content in a git repository (see Rocky Beaches and Niche Museums). Every content management system I've ever been has eventually desired revision control, and modeling that in a database and adding it to an existing project is always a huge pain.</p>
<p>I have 18 years of content on this blog. I want that backed up to git - and this week I realized I have the tools to do that already.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/simonw/db-to-sqlite">db-to-sqlite</a> is my tool for taking any SQL Alchemy supported database (so far tested with MySQL and PostgreSQL) and exporting it into a SQLite database.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-diffable">sqlite-diffable</a> is a very early stage tool I built last year. The idea is to dump a SQLite database out to disk in a way that is designed to work well with git diffs. Each table is dumped out as newline-delimited JSON, one row per line.</p>
<p>So... how about converting my blog's PostgreSQL database to SQLite, then dumping it to disk with <code>sqlite-diffable</code> and committing the result to a git repository? And then running that in a GitHub Action?</p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog-backup/blob/main/.github/workflows/backup.yml">the workflow</a>. It does exactly that, with a few extra steps: it only grabs a subset of my tables, and it redacts the <code>password</code> column from my <code>auth_user</code> table so that my hashed password isn't exposed in the backup.</p>
<p>I now have <a href="https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog-backup/commits/main">a commit log</a> of changes to my blog's database!</p>
<p>I've set it to run nightly, but I can trigger it manually by clicking a button too.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://iapp.org/">International Association of Privacy Professionals</a> (IAPP) has an open call for submissions for their IAPP Privacy Tech Vendor Report. The deadline for submission for the next report is Friday, August 21, 2020. You have 2 days left. Here are the <a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/privacy-tech-vendor-report/#guidelines">guidelines</a> and the <a href="https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/59d51c960fc1400b96893e50554f91c8">submission form</a> for you to submit your entry for the report.</p>



<blockquote><p>IAPP has yet to recognize self-sovereign identity (SSI) as an independent category for privacy management.</p></blockquote>



<p>Don’t worry; the submission process is easy; you just have to fill out a few fields. It should only take a few minutes. </p>



  Company name  Company website  New or Existing Vendor  Location  Number of employees  Founded Year  Leadership (top executives, with full names and titles)  How is your organization is funded?  Privately held or Publicly traded  Best fit category (Activity monitoring, Assessment manager, Consent management, Data discovery, Data mapping, Data Subject Requests, De-identification, Enterprise communications, Incident response, Information privacy manager, or Website scanning)  100-word description  Logo and screenshot of tech solution  Contact name  Contact email address  



 About the IAPP 



<p>According to the IAPP “The International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP) is a resource for professionals who want to develop and advance their careers by helping their organizations successfully manage these risks and protect their data. In fact, we’re the world’s largest and most comprehensive global information privacy community.”</p>



 Why SSI Players Should Submit 



<p>The surveillance economy has gotten out of hand. </p>



<p>It is time to help privacy professionals and the establishment recognize that they can help their organizations successfully manage risks and protect data by putting identity and personal information and controls in the hands of the people, the data subjects, from which the data (inc. attribute data, labor data, and capitol data) are derived.  </p>



<p>The risks of identity and personal data mismanagement for organizations and individuals alike are no longer just a simple annoyance; the mismanagement and ineffective stewardship of identity and personal data can lead to meaningful lost opportunity and lasting emotional, financial,  social, professional, reputational, and physical harm for everyone. </p>



<p>SII solutions (in all their glory) are part of the answer: SSI players have the power to help organizations reduce risk and people to securely and safely collect, manage, gain insight from, and exchange their identities and personal information.</p>



<p>Empowering people with privacy is important. Privacy is the ability for an individual to control the who, what, when, where, for how long, and for what purpose an entity can access and use their identity or personal information. </p>



<p>Most privacy tech does not help with this, SSI can. </p>



<blockquote><p>Individuals should have agency over their identity and personal information. </p></blockquote>



 Let’s get recognized by the IAPP and the industry at-large 



<p>Since the IAPP does not have an SSI category, I’d recommend that SSI players use the “Consent Management” and any other category they deem relevant to their product when making their submission. Remember, in your description, be sure to refer to your solution as being SSI related so as to help the IAPP connect the dots.</p>



<p>I have reached out to the IAPP and will be working with them to help them understand the importance of SSI “privacy technologies” and to recognize SSI as an independent category in future reports.</p>



<p>Please, be sure to submit your solution to this year’s report. If we get enough submissions, there is a chance that we can persuade the IAPP to carve our a specific SSI section in the next or future reports.</p>

 Interesting effort to unify the fragmented DataFrame API ecosystem, where increasing numbers of libraries offer APIs inspired by Pandas that imitate each other but aren't 100% compatible.

  What you see there is a flammagenitus cloud rising to the north above Ranch 2, a wildfire about fifteen miles east of here in the San Gabriel Mountains, just north of Asuza (one of too many towns to remember, in greater Los Angeles).

<p>What you see there is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flammagenitus_(cloud)">flammagenitus cloud</a> rising to the north above <a href="https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/6961/">Ranch 2</a>, a wildfire about fifteen miles east of here in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Gabriel_Mountains">San Gabriel Mountains</a>, just north of Asuza (one of too many towns to remember, in greater Los Angeles). If the video works, you’ll see how how the clouds give shape to the heat from the fire, even as smoke (darker and with a gray/magenta color) stopping at a lower elevation, spreads northward in the same direction.</p>
<p>The fire was caused by arson, <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/person-of-interest-possibly-connected-to-1500-acre-blaze-in-azusa/2413265/">says the guy</a> who confessed to starting it.</p>
<p>It’s interesting to see how much reporting on fires has changed in the time I’ve been <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=doc+searls+%23fire+inciweb&amp;ia=web">following stories like this</a> in Southern California. <a href="https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/">Inciweb</a>, the canonical close-to-live running catalog of wildfires in the U.S. has moved from the .org where it started to <a href="https://www.nwcg.gov/">NCWG.gov</a>, the National Coordinating Wildfire Group. When I <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/lets-do-news-what-we-did-software">first wrote about</a> Inciweb, back in ’06, I didn’t mention that it was entirely the heroic work of one Linux hacker at the Forest Service who didn’t wish to be identified.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you want to catch up on the Ranch2, one of <a href="https://fsapps.nwcg.gov/afm/data/activefiremaps/cgb2020230_1700.jpg">too many wildfires</a> clouding the western skies right now, <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=ranch2&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live">here’s the Twitter search for the latest</a>.</p>

<p>It has been quite some time since I’ve been inspired to write. This is my first Medium story. What finally broke through the noise and my inertia was the launch of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.humanitypower.co/">Humanity&nbsp;Power</a>, an initiative released today by my friend Charisse.</p>



<blockquote><p>The Humanity Power message:<br>There is “unity” within humanity.</p></blockquote>



 Understanding the Humanity Power Message 



<p>What the message of Humanity Power teaches me is that through an understanding and respect for our humanity we can all come together regardless of ethnicity, age, skin color, religion, ability, sexual orientation, gender, class, social status, or national origin, to achieve greatness. In other words, it is through unity, and the mindful eradication of the “isms” in our lives — racism, sexism, ableism, ageism, colroism, classism, etc. — that we can be of service to each other, to ourselves, and strive to achieve, and maintain a world and a life filled with achievement, rich experiences and lessons, and most importantly gratitude and joy.</p>



  



<p>The concept of Humanity Power is hugely relevant to my passions and area of commercial and academic focus — the empowerment of people so that they can achieve digital sovereignty; so that they can achieve agency of their phygital self.</p>



<p>The message of Humanity Power is essential; understanding and embracing it is an important step toward our achieving digital sovereignty.</p>



<p>I invite you all to join me in spreading the Humanity Power message. I encourage you to think about the concept. Share it. Write about it. And, for you to buy Humanity Power t-shirts for yourself or as a gift for your family members, friends, and colleagues.</p>



<p>Humanity Power t-shirts are available at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.humanitypower.co/">www.humanitypower.co</a>&nbsp;for $25.00 + shipping. They are super comfy black tees with “unity” depicted in white, teal, orange, or rainbow text.</p>



<p>Let’s all work together to spread the message of unity through our humanity.</p>



<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/"></a></p><p>Firefox matters. The other major browsers are all subject to a larger corporation's business interests: Safari is built in the context of the App Store, Chrome must support Google's ad targeting business, and Edge fills a gap in the Windows ecosystem. But Firefox is here to fight for the users: it supports web standards and user privacy as public goods in their own right. <br><br>It also happens to be the best browser. It's the one I choose to make my default at home and at work, not for ideological reasons, but because it works the way I want it to. It's fast, private, functional, and more resource efficient.<br><br>Even if it wasn't, its existence would be important. In the same way that it's harmful for most people to get their news from Facebook, giving that corporation undue power over the flow of information that informs voters and underpins democratic society, it's dangerous for most of us to access the web through Chrome. In a world where so much of our lives are threaded through the web (particularly during the pandemic), giving one corporation control over the way the web works hands them the same kind of undue power.<br><br>And, of course, it's open source. Firefox is built in the open, <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">using a community-driven approach</a>. That alone makes it unique among the big browsers.<br><br>Mozilla is one of the few unabashed forces for good in the tech industry, <a href="https://civilityandtruth.com/2020/08/13/mozillas-uncertain-future/">which is why the news that it had laid off a quarter of its workforce hit me hard</a>. It deserves our support.<br><br>But these two things can be true at once: Firefox is an important force for good, and it's a squandered opportunity that has not shown the way on the web as often as it should have. In service to Mozilla's desire to provide it for free - perhaps remembering <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars">the paid-for Netscape's loss to Microsoft's free Internet Explorer</a> long ago - it has been funded by a small handful of default search engine agreements. There has been no revenue innovation; very little feature innovation that would rock the boat of those lucrative agreements.<br><br>It seems odd for a privacy-aligned, community-driven web browser to be largely funded by targeted advertising. <a href="https://www.isc.hbs.edu/strategy/business-strategy/pages/the-five-forces.aspx">It's also a textbook business risk</a>: all Google needs to do is withdraw its check, and Firefox is toast. Something more diversified and reliable is clearly needed.<br><br><a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/02/27/mozilla-acquires-pocket/">Mozilla's acquisition of Pocket</a> was a foot in the door for subscription revenue models. Its <a href="https://vpn.mozilla.org/">new privacy-orientated VPN</a> -&nbsp; sadly not available on macOS yet - is an expansion of that strategy. But it's been executed far from perfectly, and an unanticipated revenue gap <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/mozilla-lays-off-70-as-it-waits-for-subscription-products-to-generate-revenue/">was the declared reason for Mozilla's first layoff this year</a>, back in January.<br><br>I make a donation to <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/">the Mozilla Foundation</a> every month, but I don't pay for Pocket (which I use every day) or the VPN product (which I can't use yet). I suspect many users are like me: we deeply appreciate Mozilla's work, but we're not that excited about the subscription products. Mozilla has done a bad job at targeting us: I'm not sure why it hasn't been possible to become a patron from within Firefox, or to pay an all-in Mozilla Subscription analogous to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-13/apple-readies-apple-one-subscription-bundles-to-boost-services">the rumored Apple One</a>, but I would have jumped on those chances.<br><br>Over the last few years, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/may/01/guardian-breaks-even-helped-by-success-of-supporter-strategy">the Guardian has broken even because of reader patronage</a>. Unlike a paywalled site, where only subscribers could access content, readers like me pay to allow everyone to access its journalism. We do it because we find its existence valuable. Wikipedia is another organization that makes a patronage model work. Mozilla occupies a similar place in the world: a socially-positive organization with a minority of users who are affluent enough to pay for the rest, and will do so because they believe it's the right thing to do. There hasn't been a unified strategy to pursue this, but there should be.<br><br>There's no need to create a bazillion new revenue-generating products. A VPN is great, but there are lots of VPNs to choose from; a reading app is fine, but there are loads. There is only one community-driven vendor of privacy-preserving internet tools with a focus on keeping their users safe. Mozilla needs to focus on what it does best and do better at letting its community support it. We understand its importance, and we're here for it.<br><br><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browsers/">You should install Firefox today.</a></p>

 Introducing Self-Sovereign Student&nbsp;ID <blockquote>Part 2 of 2: ID Is Only the Beginning.</blockquote> Achievements, Skills, &amp; Competencies <p>For many working with SSI and VCs, exchanging achievements is the top-of-mind use case. By achievements, I mean any kind: diplomas, degrees, certificates, skills, <a href="https://www.stradaeducation.org/report/the-new-geography-of-skills/">skill shapes</a>, competencies, badges, milestones, grades, awards, commendations, micro-credentials, incremental achievements, and&nbsp;others.</p><p>Students will eventually share their achievements in pursuit of a job, but they also may want to transfer between schools, or <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeltnietzel/2019/02/19/reverse-transfer-a-second-chance-at-a-first-degree/#3ecc67bc7bea">reverse transfer</a> credits from their current school to a former one. SSI and VCs are the ideal means of receiving achievements in a form where they can be readily shared again, and instantly trustable without a manual verification process.</p><p>But unlike student ID, broadly useful achievements exchange among schools and employers not only requires them to become capable of issuing, holding, and verifying VCs, it also requires them to come to agreement about how the data payload should be arranged. This will happen, but it’s gonna take awhile. Thankfully, there is significant and growing momentum toward precisely that.</p><p>For example, serious efforts are underway at the <a href="https://www.uschamberfoundation.org/t3-innovation">T3 Innovation Network</a>, within the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, in developing <a href="https://lerhub.org/g/bqCgme2fQxDbgJ6D7">Learning and Employment Records</a>, or LERs. LERs are powered by the same VC standards and technologies that enable self-sovereign student ID, with the same issue, hold, verify model to/from an SSI wallet, which they call a “<a href="https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/preview/FeqEJI3S5KelmLv8XJss">learner wallet</a>” for simplicity. A learner wallet is the same as an SSI wallet, with one important addition: a learner wallet includes in its scope the capability for a student to store some VCs in a cloud-based container with a custodian, in place of or in addition to a personally held wallet, and retain self-sovereign control over them. This is useful with large data sets, infrequently used credentials, and as a backup, and is offered by the likes of ASU’s <a href="https://trust.asu.edu/">Trusted Learner Network</a> and the <a href="https://www.velocitynetwork.foundation/">Velocity Network Foundation</a>.</p><p>An impressive piece was recently released that everyone interested in interoperable achievements should read, whether in the U.S. or abroad: <a href="https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/preview/9g21loK6RriHFkPRE4zJ">Applying Self-sovereign Identity Principles To Interoperable Learning Records</a>. The lead author of that piece, <a href="https://twitter.com/kimdhamilton">Kim Hamilton Duffy</a>, also leads a group called the <a href="https://openlearning.mit.edu/news/university-led-digital-credentials-consortium-explores-technology-digital-academic-credentials">Digital Credentials Consortium</a> (DCC). DCC includes 14 intrepid schools, including the likes of MIT and Harvard, developing interoperability of achievements that are literally carried by the achievers. They also <a href="https://digitalcredentials.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/white-paper-building-digital-credential-infrastructure-future.pdf">see VCs</a> as the basis for this interoperability, and are making exciting progress.</p><p>My conclusion: VCs are where “the puck is headed” for broad, even global academic interoperability, they are the containers referred to in these documents that can securely transport the achievement or LER “payload” between issuers and verifiers, via the achiever&nbsp;herself.</p><p>By using this same VC technology for student ID, a school does three critical things to lay the foundation for later exchanging achievements:</p>  It puts the tools necessary for exchanging achievements into schools’ and students’ hands.  It gets schools familiar with working with VCs: issuing, verifying, and managing.  It gets students familiar with using an SSI wallet: making connections, receiving VCs, sharing VCs, communicating, giving consent,&nbsp;etc.  <p>After self-sovereign student ID is in place, issuing an achievement or LER to a student means simply clicking a different button (or&nbsp;two).</p> The “Digital Experience” <p>Education is increasingly engaged in digital transformation, from enrollment to instruction to achievement and employment. Through all the schools, programs and other experiences you might have, there is one thing that’s constant: you. You are the ideal courier of your own data whenever it’s useful to prove or qualify for something, if only you could receive your data, have a way to hold it and present it, and it was verifiable when presented. That is precisely what this technology does.</p><p>When you realize that self-sovereign student ID is simply a school-issued digital VC held inside a secure wallet capable of also storing verifiable achievements, and that wallet ideally belongs to the student and not the school, it becomes clear how it can become foundational to a lifetime digital learning experience for that learner. In this context, the “Digital Student ID” becomes a part of the digital experience rather than the whole of&nbsp;it.</p><p>This also ties into the <a href="https://www.stradaeducation.org/network/institute-for-the-future-of-work/">future of work</a>, where lifelong achievements can be accumulated by the student and later used to prove skills and competencies to prospective employers at a granular level, with the power of selective disclosure enabling strong privacy to avoid oversharing.</p><p>Taken together, this is direct application of the “Internet of Education” from the <a href="https://www.learningeconomy.io/">Learning Economy Foundation</a>, a vision that is now feasible and with which self-sovereign student ID is&nbsp;aligned.</p> Privileges, Perks, &amp;&nbsp;Freebies <p>Unlike typical digital credentials or even digital student ID, with self-sovereign student ID students can prove their ID and status anywhere, not just in school-approved or school-connected systems. This independence opens up the entire internet and the world itself, to embrace your school’s students as verifiably what they claim to be, and give them whatever benefits and privileges that status might conceivably afford. This could mean, at any non-school organization, online or&nbsp;off:</p>  Formless onboarding &amp; passwordless authentication at&nbsp;websites  Freebies, discounts and special deals&nbsp;anywhere  Access to students-only facilities and events from multiple&nbsp;schools  Access to special loans, grants, scholarships and&nbsp;more  <p>Intuitively, the more benefits you can arrange for your students, the more they will want to become your students; with self-sovereign student ID, you can unlock more benefits than ever&nbsp;before.</p> Communication &amp; Interaction <p>This category of capabilities is often overlooked in SSI, but I believe it could become the most used and beneficial class of capabilities that self-sovereign student ID enables. If you think about how much time we spend communicating versus how much time we spend authenticating, you’ll get where I’m coming&nbsp;from.</p><p>Before issuing a VC to a student, a direct connection must be established between the student’s chosen wallet and the school. This connection is unlike other connections the school may have with the student, and unlike the connections people have with each other; it is peer-to-peer, private, and encrypted end-to-end.</p><p>This connection between school and student isn’t ephemeral; it persists until either side breaks it, even for alumni who’ve long since left the school (useful for helping keep track of grads for annual IPEDS and other accreditation reporting), It is a new, private, digital relationship between school and student that enables interactions of many forms: messages, phone calls, video calls, file exchange, playing games, taking polls, voting, gathering permission or consent (digitally signed by the student), granting the school’s consent (digitally signed by the school), and&nbsp;more.</p><p>A bit like email, both your school and the student can use different services to help with your/their end of the connection. And these services are substitutable; there is no single vendor in the middle that is connecting both sides, as there is with popular messaging services today. If there were, then self-sovereign independence is lost and most of the benefits listed in this article along with it, replaced with dependence on that intermediary.</p><p>Using this capability, schools could do away with proprietary messaging systems they’ve installed to ensure <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html">FERPA</a>-protected data, for example, is not shared incorrectly, and instead use a standards-based system that comes for free with self-sovereign student&nbsp;ID.</p><p>This communication channel must be respected and not overused, because either side can choose to break it; it’s not like email or a phone number where the other party can simply resume sending messages from another address or device. Reconnection can happen at any time, but both parties must opt in. I particularly love this aspect of SSI, because it is the beginning of the end to spam and phishing, and encourages considerate communications behavior on all&nbsp;sides.</p> Preventing Fraud &amp;&nbsp;Phishing <p>Once issued to the student by the school, self-sovereign student ID helps prevent <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/college-identity-theft-a-growing-problem-1947515">student-related fraud</a>, including with student AID programs the student may apply for with outside organizations, such as government, scholarship programs, and others. Once these organizations realize they can receive cryptographic proof directly from the student, they can lessen their reliance on passwords, social security numbers, and other personal information, bringing us closer to a world devoid of identity theft, where having someone’s personal information — even their passwords — is no longer sufficient to impersonate them.</p><p>When a student applies and presents their VCs for verification, the benefits offeror, such as FAFSA in the U.S., can instantly and digitally verify, either remotely or in person, the student’s ID and status as a student, even when the organization isn’t connected to the school’s systems. Eventually, as VCs become more prevalent and the student acquires more VCs as they progress in their learner journey, they’ll be able to prove things like their citizenship or visitor status, high school diploma, GED, academic progress, and more, further preventing fraud and accelerating the process of applying for student&nbsp;aid.</p><p>Of course this use case requires the benefits offeror to gain the ability to verify VCs, which they could do tomorrow, but in reality may take&nbsp;awhile.</p><p>Phishing attempts to impersonate the school in communications with the student can also be detected and prevented, by sending school communications through the private SSI connection or by using it to validate communications sent via other means. And the school isn’t the only one fraudsters may try to impersonate: faculty, staff, tutors, proctors, authorized partners, service providers and more can be strongly and mutually authenticated by using this same capability.</p> Why Not Embed An SSI Wallet Into Your School’s Existing&nbsp;App? <p>We hear questions about “embedded wallets” a lot, and for good reason: your school has worked hard to get your official app into as many hands as possible, so adding functionality to it makes sense, whereas asking students to get another ‘app’ — even though an SSI wallet isn’t really an app — seems almost a non-starter.</p><p>Well, if a self-sovereign ‘wallet’ were just another app, and intended solely for interacting with your school, this sentiment would make perfect sense. But it isn’t, so it doesn’t, at least in the longer term. But it might in the short&nbsp;term.</p><p>We should unpack that a&nbsp;bit.</p><p>‘Wallet’ is a woefully inadequate term for what SSI is and does for a person; it is useful because it is an <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/when-explaining-ssi-start-with-the-wallet-bee5d2af6696">easy to understand</a> metaphor for the most basic building blocks of SSI, but it is ultimately misleading, like mistaking the trunk of an elephant <a href="http://www.simoncamilleri.com/the_truth_of_the_elephant/">for a snake</a>. SSI is more like a self-sovereign cockpit for consolidating all your relationships, not just your academic ones, and certainly not just one school. SSI consolidates, under your ultimate control, your connections, communications, interactions, agreements, preferences and data, even data not in your physical possession like medical data, which might be best physically stored with a healthcare provider or other custodian. Leaving all that in bespoke, embedded wallets from each provider brings you right back to the status quo, with your relationships, interactions, and data spread out and under the ultimate control of third parties, with all that entails: vendor lock-in; privacy, security, and compliance issues; ID theft; surveillance capitalism; duplicate relationships and data;&nbsp;etc.</p><p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity/own-your-identity">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2018/12/03/mastercard-microsoft-join-forces-to-advance-digital-identity-innovations/">Mastercard</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/solutions/identity/networks">IBM</a>, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/samsung-telcos-banks-to-collaborate-on-blockchain-mobile-authentication/">Samsung</a>, the <a href="https://www.culedger.com/">US Credit Union industry</a> and hundreds of others globally are now developing SSI/VC tech for use in many industries, so your school will soon not be the only entity offering SSI-powered benefits to your students, faculty and staff. Imagine if every organization embedded wallets into their own apps rather than working with an external one, or if every payment, ID, and loyalty card you carried required its own separate physical wallet… people would begin to get annoyed, to say the least, and prefer schools and organizations that made life easier, not&nbsp;harder.</p><p>All that said, an embedded wallet could be a reasonable tradeoff early on, when SSI is new and its first uses for your students may be limited to your school. So if you jump on self-sovereign student ID quickly as an early adopter, you could embed SSI/VC/wallet tech into your existing app, foregoing self-sovereignty for now without too much of a tradeoff, and still gain several of the key benefits mentioned. Then, as students, faculty, and staff begin to receive SSI connection requests and VC offers from their other relationships in life, and they start wanting to consolidate things, you can make moves toward greater self-sovereignty with less of a dilemma, counting on SSI’s standards-enabled portability.</p> What’s Ready&nbsp;Now?  What’s Ready   Code, Products, &amp; Services — Open source <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">code</a>; VC-oriented products from <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/identity-standards-blog/ion-booting-up-the-network/ba-p/1441552">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://credentials.workday.com/docs/overview/">Workday</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/solutions/identity">IBM</a>, and dozens of startups.  Compatibility With Existing Federated ID — CAS, Okta, Ping, ForgeRock, etc. for connecting with SAML, OAuth, OIDC and other federation protocols for passwordless login, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2018/01/22/everybody-knows-how-knowledge-based-authentication-died/">KBA</a>-free call-in, and cardless walk-in authentication.  Standards Work — <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/vc/participants">W3C</a>, <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust over IP Foundation</a>, <a href="https://identity.foundation/">DIF</a>  Custodial Solutions — <a href="https://trust.asu.edu/">Trusted Learner Network</a>, <a href="https://www.velocitynetwork.foundation/">Velocity Network Foundation</a>  Broad Consensus About VCs — The Verifiable Credential is the only <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/verifiable-credentials-arent-credentials-they-re-containers-fab5b3ae5c0">container</a> I’m consistently seeing under consideration for <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/how-verifiable-credentials-bridge-trust-domains-97155d0f3c17">transporting verifiable data between trust domains</a>, which self-sovereign control and trust require, from academia to healthcare to finance and&nbsp;beyond.  Broad Consensus About Individual Control of Data — From academia to healthcare to Europe’s GDPR and the current disdain for big tech and surveillance capitalism, I see broad consensus that control over data must move more and more into the hands of individuals, even data not in their physical possession.  Momentum — Years of global open-source development and standards work for SSI; orgs large and small in many industries are actively participating in developing VC code, standards, use cases and business models; strong support from the T3 Innovation Network in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.   What’s Not Ready&nbsp;(Yet)   User Experience — The SSI space knows the basics — issue, hold, and verify VCs — but does not yet have the UX figured out. Honestly, the existing SSI wallets I’ve seen are all still a bit clunky and confusing (even though it’s still a much better experience than passwords or answering personal questions), but they do work. Usability must be smoothed and complexity hidden, and access for the disabled, older devices, and more, has yet to be addressed.  Interoperability — Today, standards are ahead of implementations. All the players know the importance of interop but haven’t gotten there yet, though there are serious multi-org testing and development efforts underway to get it resolved. I like the alignment of incentives here: any vendor not interoperable with others will be left on its own technology island.  Communications — While these private, peer-to-peer connections can support any kind of communication, so far I’ve not seen anything other than simple messaging.  Passive Authentication — I look forward to the day when I can be authenticated by those I know and trust passively, by policy, by automatically sharing the appropriate proofs when prompted, without touching my device. As far as I know, only active authentication is now&nbsp;offered.  Embedded Agents in Door Access Readers — Another missing element is embedded SSI agents into NFC (or other tap technology) readers, to make door access compatible and performant.  Ancillary &amp; Rainy Day Use Cases — Most new tech must first nail sunny day scenarios before tackling the rainy day ones. For example, VCs could be used for guardian relationships, children, pets, things, and complex organizational hierarchies, but those haven’t been done anywhere that I’m aware of. VCs could work off-line or from a QR code on a card or piece of paper, but no one has gone there yet either, to my knowledge.  <p>Considering what’s ready today, what’s not ready, the long list of benefits for both schools and students, the fraud with existing credentials, and the possibility of eliminating existing costs (see next section), I think it adds up to a compelling case that self-sovereign student ID is ready for piloting.</p><p>That said, the pieces that enable self-sovereign student ID are nascent and only recently available; it is a new application of SSI that itself has only been around for about four years, and mostly in the lab and not much in production, though that is changing. Schools considering this in 2020 would be the first, which for those that prefer to lead rather than follow makes for a wonderful opportunity, especially during a pandemic.</p><p>Cue the <a href="https://ondigitalmarketing.com/learn/odm/foundations/5-customer-segments-technology-adoption/">Technology Adoption Lifecycle</a>… welcome, Innovators!</p> Where to&nbsp;Begin <p>To get started with self-sovereign student ID, a school needs capabilities to issue and verify VCs, and students need wallets to hold&nbsp;them.</p><p>Code for simple issuance tools is available open source, more advanced tools are offered by various SSI service providers, and standards-compliant SSI wallets are available for free in both Apple and Google app stores. Verification is the tricky part, as it requires existing school systems to be adapted to accept VCs for authentication, and later for other purposes¹. Thankfully, some IAM systems commonly found in higher ed are adaptable now:</p><p>For schools running <a href="https://www.apereo.org/projects/cas">CAS</a>, <a href="https://www.okta.com/">Okta</a>, or any IAM system that facilitates an external Identity Provider, self-sovereign student ID can be integrated relatively painlessly, enabling students to immediately use it in place of passwords, and potentially eliminating the need for a dedicated 2FA provider. For contact centers running Salesforce Service Cloud, the StudentPass product that <a href="https://www.credentialmaster.com/">Credential Master</a> is developing will integrate natively, enabling students to use their VCs to authenticate when calling in, without answering personal questions.</p><p>Of course, integrations can be made with any existing system.

 Introducing Self-Sovereign Student&nbsp;ID <blockquote>Part 1 of <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/introducing-self-sovereign-student-id-part-2-of-2-a566ed414d75">2</a>: Strong, flexible, digital student ID that’s not bound to your campus, network, or&nbsp;vendor.</blockquote><p>Full Disclosure: The benefits discussed here apply to self-sovereign student ID generally and are not specific to any vendor or product, and do not result in vendor lock-in; any standards-compliant SSI tools for issuance, holding, and verification could deliver these results. As a partner of venture studio <a href="https://digitaltrust.vc/">Digital Trust Ventures</a>, I am a co-founder of <a href="https://www.credentialmaster.com/">Credential Master</a>, a startup now developing a self-sovereign student ID&nbsp;product.</p> TL;DR:   Digital student ID: doesn’t exist yet for most students.  Self-sovereign student ID: students independently store verifiable data, and strongly prove things about themselves anywhere, online or&nbsp;off.  Many uses: strong, passwordless login, KBA-free call in, &amp; cardless walk in; secure, keyless facility and systems access; prove skills, competencies and achievements; secure peer-to-peer communication and interaction; breakthrough fraud prevention; student-controlled privacy; digitally signed consent; and&nbsp;more.  Open standards: not tied to a specific vendor, usable outside the school’s&nbsp;network.  Schools can start with self-sovereign student ID today, without waiting for collaboration with or agreement from other institutions.  <a href="https://link.medium.com/W3o6duQc19">Part 2: ID is Only the Beginning</a>  <p>Note: This article assumes a basic understanding of the concepts of <a href="https://sovrin.org/faq/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity (SSI)</a>, especially <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a> (VCs). The technical specifics of how VCs are issued, revoked, held, verified, and trustworthy are covered extensively across the SSI industry. Basic VC mechanics can be found in my other post: <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/how-verifiable-credentials-bridge-trust-domains-97155d0f3c17">How Verifiable Credentials Bridge Trust&nbsp;Domains</a>.</p> Digital Student&nbsp;ID <p>For most students, digital student ID still doesn’t&nbsp;exist.</p><p>I’ve been asking experts in academia what comes to mind when I say “digital student ID,” and here is what I learned: other than login credentials for a student portal — which don’t count — a digital student ID still doesn’t exist, at least not for most students in most&nbsp;schools.</p><p>The first, still obscure attempts at what I would call real digital student ID have cropped up fairly recently, enabling students to prove their identity in multiple environments and granting them access to electronic systems, software, and even physical facilities. Apple has introduced <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/08/apple-brings-contactless-student-ids-on-iphone-and-apple-watch-to-more-universities/">their version</a> of digital student ID that works exclusively with Apple software and devices, and various smaller companies have launched similarly proprietary software platforms with corresponding apps. Search “student ID” in the Apple or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/search?q=%22student%20ID%22&amp;c=apps">Google app stores</a> and you’ll find dozens of similar offerings.</p><p>So why hasn’t digital student ID caught on? I think it’s because available offerings are tied to a single vendor, usable only in systems and facilities where that vendor is installed, and verifiable only by that vendor’s app. In Apple’s case it’s tied to their hardware, too. Even a homegrown digital student ID solution can be verified only by an associated homegrown app. It is vendor lock-in to the extreme, even if that ‘vendor’ is the school&nbsp;itself.</p><p>For a school to confidently roll out a more broadly useful digital student ID, it must be with technology that can traverse boundaries between vendors, both within the school’s network and external to it, such as when a student applies for aid. Such technology now exists, and it can do a heckuva lot more than&nbsp;ID.</p><p>Introducing a powerful new model for student ID: “self-sovereign” student&nbsp;ID.</p> Self-Sovereign Student&nbsp;ID <p>You may have heard of self-sovereign identity, or SSI¹. In this article I’ll explore how self-sovereign student ID can apply SSI capabilities and principles for students, faculty, and staff in an educational environment, primarily higher education.</p><p>I recognize that the term “self-sovereign” may not resonate as well with some in academia, which is often dominated by institutions preferring to expand their scope of control and influence, and perceiving self-sovereignty as a threat. However, it is the very act of giving greater control and independence to students that yields most of the benefits listed in this article, and counter intuitively, a closer, richer relationship with those students.</p><p>I’ll discuss this more in “Why Self-Sovereign” below.</p> What Is&nbsp;It? <p>The term “self-sovereign” is unfortunately not self-explanatory, but when properly understood should feel like a familiar analog to physical identity and credentials, which we already use in a self-sovereign manner well beyond the physical and digital bounds of the organization that issued them to&nbsp;us.</p><p>In short, self-sovereign student ID gives students the ability to independently and securely store tamper-resistant, verifiable data related to themselves, and to prove things wherever they want by privately sharing cryptographic (mathematical) proofs from that data, online or off. Importantly, it also enables students to securely, directly, and privately communicate and interact with the&nbsp;school.</p><p>Technically, the student has self-sovereign control over three²&nbsp;things:</p>  A standardized digital container, for holding verifiable data;  Peer-to-peer connections between their container and the containers of other people, organizations, and&nbsp;things³;  Verifiable Credentials (VCs) that the student accepts into their wallet, and shares proofs of with others when&nbsp;desired.  <p>Today, that self-sovereign container is typically a standardized digital SSI “wallet”⁴ within a compliant app that the student can see and interact with on a smart device; eventually, wallets will be found anywhere digital things are stored and become part of the everyday life of people, organizations, and things, hidden and integrated into our devices and experiences in a way where we no longer notice or think of&nbsp;them.</p><p>One important point that will help readers better understand VCs, both in this document and generally: I believe VCs are misnamed, they are not credentials, they are verifiable containers capable of transporting any data payload, which may or may not be typically considered a “credential.” This means that VCs held in a wallet are containers within a larger container, but this is a feature, not a bug; it is how physical goods are transported in <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=meatspace">meatspace</a> and is very useful. I’ve written about these points in greater detail&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/verifiable-credentials-arent-credentials-they-re-containers-fab5b3ae5c0">here</a>.</p> Why Self-Sovereign? <p>Self-sovereignty implies giving students control over their data and how it’s shared. That may seem counter intuitive to the traditional academic notion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_loco_parentis">in loco parentis</a>, but the truth is that it not only mirrors how physical student IDs work, it simplifies the IT integration work while expanding the possible use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>Importantly, an SSI-based student ID binds the school-issued (and verifiable) information in the ID to a student’s right to use it. Through this binding, students can prove, at their own discretion, that they are enrolled, taking classes, receiving or received grades (and what they are), received a degree, and so on. Giving these facts to students in digital form can make their lives easier, reducing friction and fraud for both students and the school. ID is only one of many VCs that will be issued to the student by the school for various&nbsp;uses.</p><p>And once the student has an SSI wallet, it’s not just the school that can now exchange VCs with them. The student might want to connect and exchange VCs with multiple schools, their church, their gym club, their favorite sandwich shop or other entities they interact with. You might think that sounds like an Apple or Samsung wallet, and it kinda does,&nbsp;except:</p>  SSI wallets are portable between vendors, devices, and device types (ie, move from iPhone to Samsung and back&nbsp;again)  VCs are portable between&nbsp;wallets  VCs can hold any kind of data (ie, identity, location, degree, favorite&nbsp;pizza)  VCs are cryptographically verifiable  Holders can share only part of a VC, metadata about a VC, or just proof that they have one, without revealing anything&nbsp;else  The protocols that make wallets and VCs portable and interoperable are open and standardized  <p>And of course, Apple and Android wallets don’t enable persistent, encrypted connections with other people, organizations and things for secure peer-to-peer communication and interaction, but I’m getting ahead of&nbsp;myself…</p> A Thousand&nbsp;Uses <p>By “useful” I mean it can be used for many important, new, relevant purposes and also make expected and ordinary uses&nbsp;better.</p><p>I’ll organize the usefulness of self-sovereign student ID into six categories:</p>  Identity &amp;&nbsp;Access  Achievements, Skills, &amp; Competencies  The “Digital Experience”  Privileges, Perks &amp;&nbsp;Freebies  Communication &amp; Interaction  Preventing Fraud &amp;&nbsp;Phishing  <p>The first category, Identity &amp; Access, will be covered within this Part 1 and is where I’ll delve the most deeply. I’ll touch on the remaining categories in <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/introducing-self-sovereign-student-id-part-2-of-2-a566ed414d75">Part&nbsp;2</a>.</p><p>Note: As mentioned above, it is outside the scope of this article to explain the basic mechanics of SSI and VC exchange, such as how the initial encrypted connections are offered and accepted, how VCs are offered and accepted using those connections, how VC presentation and verification occurs, or how those verifications can be trustworthy. Those subjects are covered amply by many other documents, papers, and websites throughout the SSI industry, and are the reason for the industry’s abundant standards activity. Refer to links at the beginning of this article for more information.</p> Identity &amp;&nbsp;Access <p>The primary use of self-sovereign student ID — and the gateway to limitless other uses — is as a digital, and therefore more powerful, version of a student ID card, enabling students to instantly and strongly prove their identity and status as a student, online or off, without passwords.</p> Password Replacement <p>Perhaps the simplest starting point for self-sovereign student ID is to replace passwords. Passwords have many known problems with both security and UX, and can be replaced with a quick ping to a student’s smartphone. The student responds with a tap, which cryptographically shares their school-issued ID, which is instantly verifiable by the&nbsp;school.</p><p>This is a big step-up in both security and user experience over passwords, and social login, and can be used in conjunction with or as a substitute for&nbsp;2FA.</p><p>For schools running CAS, Okta, or any ID system supportive of a “custom IDP” or “external authentication handler,” password replacement can be implemented quickly.</p> Identity+ <p>Self-sovereign student ID starts with a student-controlled wallet into which the school can issue VCs containing any kind of data, identity or otherwise. So typical student ID data — name, photo, ID number, etc. — can be supplemented with any other desired information: classes registered for or taken, status and authority as a student leader, entitlements, permissions, preferences, allergies, relationships to other students, contact information, family information, achievements (more on that below), and on and&nbsp;on.</p> Multi-Factor Authentication+ (MFA+) <p>The plus in MFA+ means the ability to exchange more factors than is feasible with current tech, while not impairing the user experience, and likely improving it.</p><p>Because shared secrets (something the student knows, like a username or password) are replaced with cryptographically secure, digitally signed VCs (something the student has, like a unique key), you can exchange much stronger credentials than passwords. Because they’re digital and easily shared, you can exchange more of them, even dozens. Biometrics, location and more can also be incorporated, either as payloads within VCs or in conjunction with&nbsp;them.</p><p>Because VCs can be exchanged actively or passively behind the scenes, they are useful within <a href="https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cyberpedia/what-is-a-zero-trust-architecture">Zero Trust Architecture</a> (ZTA). For higher-risk applications, multiple signatures can be required from multiple devices and/or multiple individuals. Combining MFA+, ZTA, and multi-device and multi-signature capabilities results in a formidable approach to protecting sensitive systems and facilities.</p> Vendor Independence <p>SSI is based on standards, so tools from different vendors can be interoperable. This means that your school isn’t locked into a single vendor and can replace a vendor without reissuing IDs (try that with a traditional ID system). Students, faculty, and staff can choose from multiple wallets to store their credentials, which are portable if they later decide to switch. You might use one vendor to help issue student IDs, another to integrate with the student information system for registration and transcript data, and a third to verify student or staff status at the campus bookstore POS. You don’t have to worry that any vendor selected for digital student IDs can’t support your diverse campus needs, or that you’re stuck with lousy quality or&nbsp;service.</p><p>Use of student ID becomes no longer constrained digitally or physically by the boundaries of the school’s trust domain, or the presence of any particular vendor, removing what I believe is the #1 barrier for digital student ID adoption&nbsp;today.</p> Digital First, Then&nbsp;Physical <p>Self-sovereign student ID is digital first, but not digital only. With self-sovereign student ID you can have both digital and physical forms in several varieties.</p><p>A ‘smart’/chipped student ID card could hold an SSI wallet (note the irony) with some of a student’s VCs, greatly expanding the types of credentials, entitlements, tickets or other items the student can carry and benefit from, and making it much harder for a fraudster to get away with swapping out the name, photo, ID number,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>A student could also present a card or a paper with a QR code on it. Scanning the QR code could pull up a verified student ID, including a photo, either from a school-controlled database or from student-controlled storage. QR code-based verification could be restricted to authorized personnel, who could also be required to digitally prove their ID before gaining&nbsp;access.</p><p>Combining these capabilities, a school could issue a physical ID card with only three elements: a photo, a QR code, and an embedded chip— no name, no ID number, nothing else. If the chip and QR code worked as described above, even this extreme approach could be more useful than existing student ID cards while being more private for students and more difficult to hack for fraudsters.</p> Access+ <p>Whether for accessing digital systems, physical facilities or events, self-sovereign student ID can begin to support digital versions of key cards, vouchers, receipts and more, all uniquely associated with the student. A VC can also be issued as a bearer instrument not associated with any individual, like a movie ticket or a coupon. Using geofencing, students could be passively authenticated when entering a secure area, of course subject to their consent to the practice.</p> Mutual Authentication <p>Because it enables a bi-directional exchange of VCs, self-sovereign student ID may be the first technology that enables students to authenticate schools as strongly as schools authenticate students, preventing impersonation and phishing.</p> User Experience <p>Who doesn’t want fewer usernames and passwords to deal with? With self-sovereign student ID, the student can digitally present their ID and other entitlements and be authenticated more strongly, safely, and quickly than with usernames and passwords. This reduces the incidence of fraud, account take-over, and password reset requests.</p><p>Because the school maintains a secure, peer-to-peer connection with the student, it can use this connection to prompt the student for ID when the student calls in or walks in⁵. When calling in, this eliminates the need for knowledge-based authentication questions (birthday, mother’s maiden name, etc.) and speeds up the call; when walking in, this eliminates the need to pull out a physical student ID (useful during a pandemic).</p><p>Whether calling in, walking in, or logging in, a student can feel recognized by the school rather than repeatedly treated as a stranger.</p> Privacy &amp; Compliance <p>Today, when presenting a physical student ID card, the student divulges everything on it; there’s no way to present only part of it. With <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/a-solution-for-privacy-preserving-verifiable-credentials-f1650aa16093">selective disclosure</a> enabled by self-sovereign student ID, a student can share only the data required and nothing more, or prove something about their credentials without disclosing any of the data, or just prove that they have it. Some examples are&nbsp;helpful:</p>  Prove status as a currently enrolled student, without revealing name, ID number, or other personal&nbsp;info  Prove age is over a threshold, without revealing actual age or&nbsp;birthday  Prove address on file is within a certain area, city, or building, without revealing the exact&nbsp;location  <p>Selective disclosure is useful for many things, including voting, and can be used online or off. It affords whatever level of privacy the student desires, and satisfies both the spirit and the letter of aggressive privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA, while remaining auditable for all interactions between students and the school. And by minimizing the presentation of identity to only the attributes needed, selective disclosure curtails the unchecked growth in the ‘grey market’ of personal data, worth billions of dollars and&nbsp;growing.</p><p>And when data is shared, it is shared directly by the student with digitally signed evidence that they did so, a veritable get-out-of-jail free card in today’s PII-sensitive privacy&nbsp;climate.</p> Consolidation &amp; Simplification <p>As it scales, federated ID has a tendency to grow into a complex, tangled web of identities, identifiers, vendors, integrations, synchronizations, and registries. Self-sovereign student ID can begin a process of consolidation around a coherent identity meta system, with a reduction in vendors, a reduction in identifiers, and an overall reduction in complexity, without consolidating around a single&nbsp;vendor.</p><p>And that’s not a&nbsp;joke.</p><p>That said, I’m taking the advice of my business partner, SSI pioneer <a href="https://digitaltrust.vc/team-and-contact/">Dr. Sam Smith</a>, and avoiding diving into how this can occur within this piece. He is the better author for it anyway, as it quickly gets into a technical discussion about self-certifying identifiers, which SSI uses, versus administrative identifiers, which federated ID uses, which is his area of study and expertise. So, Sam can write a separate piece if there is sufficient interest. For readers having a pressing need related to this topic, please get in&nbsp;touch.</p> ID Is the Low-Hanging Fruit <p>For most, ID may be the best place to start with VCs. There’s far less complexity than something like achievements, and no other entities need to be consulted before adopting a particular approach; a school catches what it pitches. Plus, the benefits can be broadly and immediately felt, and readily integrated into most IAM systems. And of course, ID is a prerequisite for most other use cases; even if those feel more important or urgent, you usually need to begin by verifying who you’re dealing&nbsp;with.</p><p>If you read no further, this should already be apparent: though ID and Access may be a fraction of what self-sovereign student ID can do, it is more than enough to justify serious consideration. The uses discussed in <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/introducing-self-sovereign-student-id-part-2-of-2-a566ed414d75">Part 2</a> are cool and exciting, but just icing on the&nbsp;cake.</p><p>If you’re not planning to read Part 2 and are wondering how to operationalize self-sovereign student ID, open <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/introducing-self-sovereign-student-id-part-2-of-2-a566ed414d75">Part 2</a> and skip down to “Where to&nbsp;Begin.”</p><blockquote><a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/introducing-self-sovereign-student-id-part-2-of-2-a566ed414d75">Part 2: ID is Only the Beginning</a></blockquote><p>¹ One of the earliest/best pieces about SSI, from Christopher Allen: <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html</a></p><p>² Technically there is a fourth thing a student controls: self-certifying identifiers provide the root of trust, the crypto magic that makes it possible to traverse trust domain boundaries, but they’re “deeper under the hood” and out of scope for this piece.

I don't know how many conversations like this are happening behind the scenes, away from other peoples' eyes, but I found it alarming to the core. It's not just that democracy is the declared defining value of this country, although it is; it's that we're so far past being able to find any kind of consensus that the conversation is turning away from it. The President himself isn't particularly subtle about his predilections. I have no doubt that there is a solid contingent of conservatives who would prefer to do away with democracy itself than allow Trump to be a one-term President, and I'm certain that Trump is among their number.<br><br>Perhaps - hopefully - this conversation was an outlier. The fact remains that our primary means for voting this November is being dismantled with very little outcry. The President's demonstrably false claims about mail voter fraud have been largely unchallenged. And in a year that saw <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/7/20/21328387/portland-protests-unmarked-arrest-trump-wold">unmarked federal officers</a> under <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/08/14/top-dhs-officials-wolf-cuccinelli-are-not-legally-eligible-serve-their-current-roles-congressional-watchdog-agency-finds/">illegally-appointed leadership</a> wreak unchecked havoc on civil rights protests, not to mention the deadly <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/07/trumps-lies-about-coronavirus/608647/">mishandling of the nation's Covid-19 outbreak</a>, it's more important that citizens have their votes counted than ever.<br><br>What can we do?<br><br>First, if you're a citizen, <a href="https://www.damemagazine.com/2020-voter-info/">you need to make sure you're registered to vote</a>. Even if you think you are, it's worth checking, and it's worth doing the same for your loved ones.<br><br>Second, call your representative. Let them know that saving the post office is a priority for you. <a href="https://apwu.org/savepostoffice">The American Postal Workers Union has a great resource.</a><br><br>Third, and most importantly: vote. Vote your conscience, vote your ideals, but preferably, vote out this <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/fascist-tactics-trump-wisconsin/">anti-democratic, fascist administration</a>.<br><br>Fourth, be public about where you stand. Declare what you stand for. This year is not a good time for silence.<br><br>For the record, here's what I stand for:<br><br>I stand for socialized healthcare, free education, radical criminal justice reform, defunding the police, establishing a strong social safety net, bringing mass shootings to an end, solving the climate crisis, a democratic foreign policy, and a global, cosmopolitan, educated society where anyone can live well regardless of their background, ethnicity, orientation, or religion. A world where poverty is not a death sentence and everyone has the potential to do well - but nobody does badly. An end to the exploitation of the super-poor, and therefore the existence of the super-rich.<br><br>I stand for equal rights and opportunities for all, a guiding light based on compassion rather than capitalism, and an understanding that America is just one country on a very big planet.<br><br>I stand against concentration camps, border walls, unmarked federal forces curtailing the freedom to protest, theocracy,&nbsp; police brutality, American exceptionalism, traditional gender roles and "traditional values", corruption, racism, homophobia, sexism, capital punishment, privatized infrastructure, mass incarceration, and anti-intellectualism. The garbage culture of the current administration.<br><br>We're not going to get to where we need to be overnight. But of the choices available to us, only one will get us closer.<br><br>It's past time to turn around and start heading in the right direction.<br><br>I believe we can get there. I really do.<br><br>But we've got to work for it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@tiffanytertipes?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Tiffany Tertipes</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/vote?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p>

  Sqitch v0.9998: Now with Snowflake support, an improved Homebrew tap, and the quickest way to get started: the new [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/sqitch/sqitch/).

<p>I released <a href="https://sqitch.org/">Sqitch</a> v<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/DWHEELER/App-Sqitch-0.9998" title="App-Sqitch v0.9998">0.9998</a> this week. Despite the <a href="https://metacpan.org/source/DWHEELER/App-Sqitch-0.9998/Changes" title="Sqitch v0.9998 Changes">long list of changes</a>,
only one new feature stands out: support for the <a href="https://www.snowflake.net/">Snowflake Data Warehouse</a>
platform. A major <a href="https://iovation.com/" title="iovation, Inc.">work</a> project aims to move all of our reporting data from
Postgres to Snowflake. I asked the team lead if they needed Sqitch support, and
they said something like, “Oh hell yes, that would save us months of
work!” Fortunately I had time to make it happen.</p>
<p>Snowflake’s SQL interface ably supports all the functionality required for
Sqitch; indeed, the <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/sqitch/blob/master/lib/App/Sqitch/Engine/snowflake.pm" title="App::Sqitch::Engine::snowflake">implementation</a> required fairly little customization. And
while I did report a number of issues and shortcomings to the Snowflake support
team, they always responded quickly and helpfully — sometimes revealing
undocumented workarounds to solve my problems. I requested that they be
documented.</p>
<p>The work turned out well. If you use Snowflake, consider managing your databases
with Sqitch. Start with <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/sqitchtutorial-snowflake" title="A tutorial introduction to Sqitch change management on Snowflake">the tutorial</a> to get a feel for it.</p>
 Bundle Up 
<p>Of course, you might find it a little tricky to get started. In addition to long
list of Perl dependencies, each database engines requires two external
resources: a command-line client and a driver library. For Snowflake, that means
the <a href="https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/user-guide/snowsql.html" title="SnowSQL Client for Snowflake">SnowSQL</a> client and the <a href="https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/user-guide/odbc.html" title="ODBC Driver for Snowflake">ODBC driver</a>. The PostgreSQL engine requires
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-psql.html">psql</a> and <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/DBD::Pg">DBD::Pg</a> compiled with <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/libpq.html">libpq</a>. MySQL calls for the <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysql.html">mysql client</a>
and <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/DBD::mysql">DBD::mysql</a> compiled with the MySQL connection library. And so on. You
likely don’t care what needs to be built and installed; you just want it to
work. Ideally install a binary and go.</p>
<p>I do, too. So I spent the a month or so building Sqitch bundling support, to
easily install all its Perl dependencies into a single directory for
distribution as a single package. It took a while because, sadly, Perl provides
no straightforward method to build such a feature without also bundling unneeded
libraries. I plan to write up the technical details soon; for now, just know
that I made it work. If you <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>, you’ll reap the benefits in your next
<code>brew install sqitch</code>.</p>
 Pour One Out 
<p>In fact, the bundling feature enabled a complete rewrite of the <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/homebrew-sqitch">Sqitch Homebrew
tap</a>. Previously, Sqitch’s Homebrew formula installed the required modules in
Perl’s global include path. This pattern violated Homebrew best practices, which
prefer that all the dependencies for an app, aside from configuration, reside in
a single directory, or “cellar.”</p>
<p>The new formula follows this dictum, bundling Sqitch and its CPAN dependencies
into a nice, neat package. Moreover, it enables engine dependency selection at
build time. Gone are the separate <code>sqitch_$engine</code> formulas. Just pass the
requisite options when you build Sqitch:</p>
  <code>brew install sqitch --with-postgres-support --with-sqlite-support
</code>  <p>Include as many engines as you need (<a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/homebrew-sqitch#supported-database-engines" title="Sqitch Homebrew: Supported Database Engines">here’s the list</a>). Find yourself with only
Postgres support but now need Oracle, too? Just reinstall:</p>
  <code>export HOMEBREW_ORACLE_HOME=$ORACLE_HOME
brew reinstall sqitch --with-postgres-support --with-oracle-support
</code>  <p>In fact, the old <code>sqitch_oracle</code> formula hasn’t worked in quite some time, but
the new <code>$HOMEBREW_ORACLE_HOME</code> environment variable does the trick (provided
you <a href="https://www.imore.com/how-turn-system-integrity-protection-macos">disable SIP</a>; see <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/homebrew-sqitch/#--with-oracle-support" title="Sqitch Homebrew Oracle support">the instructions</a> for details).</p>
<p>I recently became a Homebrew user myself, and felt it important to make Sqitch
build “the right way”. I expect this formula to be more reliable and better
maintained going forward.</p>
<p>Still, despite its utility, Homebrew Sqitch lives up to its name: It downloads
and builds Sqitch from source. To attract newbies with a quick and easy method
to get started, we need something even simpler.</p>
 Dock of the Bae 
<p>Which brings me to the installer that excites me most: The new <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/sqitch/sqitch/" title="Sqitch on Docker Hub">Docker image</a>.
Curious about Sqitch and want to download and go? Use Docker? Try this:</p>
 <code>curl -L https://git.io/JJKCn -o sqitch &amp;&amp; chmod +x sqitch
./sqitch help
</code> <p>That’s it. On first run, <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/docker-sqitch/blob/master/docker-sqitch.sh" title="Sqitch Docker Shell Script">the script</a> pulls down the Docker image, which
includes full support for PostgreSQL, MySQL, Firebird, and SQLite, and weighs in
at just 164 MB (54 MB compressed). Thereafter, it works just as if Sqitch was
locally-installed. It uses a few tricks to achieve this bit of magic:</p>
 
 It mounts the current directory, so it acts on the Sqitch project you
intend it to 
 It mounts your home directory, so it can read the usual configuration files 
 It syncs the <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/sqitch-environment" title="Environment variables recognized by Sqitch">environment variables</a> that Sqitch cares about 
 
<p>The script even syncs your username, full name, and host name, in case you
haven’t configured your name and email address with <a href="http://metacpan.org/pod/sqitch-config"><code>sqitch config</code></a>. The only
outwardly obvious difference is the editor:<a>1</a> If you add
a change and let the editor open, it launches <a href="https://www.nano-editor.org" title="Nano Text Editor">nano</a> rather than your preferred
editor. This limitation allows the image ot remain as small as possible.</p>
<p>I invested quite a lot of effort into the Docker image, to make it as small as
possible while maximizing out-of-the-box database engine support — without
foreclosing support for proprietary databases. To that end, the <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/docker-sqitch" title="Sqitch Docker Packaging on GitHub">repository</a>
already contains <code>Dockerfile</code>s to support <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/docker-sqitch/tree/master/oracle/" title="Sqitch Oracle Docker instructions">Oracle</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/docker-sqitch/tree/master/snowflake/" title="Sqitch Snowflake Docker instructions">Snowflake</a>: simply
download the required binary files, built the image, and push it to your private
registry. Then set <code>$SQITCH_IMAGE</code> to the image name to transparently run it
with the magic <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/docker-sqitch/blob/master/docker-sqitch.sh" title="Sqitch Docker Shell Script">shell script</a>.</p>
 Docker Docket 
<p>I plan to put more work into the Sqitch Docker repository over the next few
months. <a href="https://www.exasol.com/">Exasol</a> and <a href="https://my.vertica.com/">Vertica</a> <code>Dockerfile</code>s come next. Beyond that, I envision
matrix of different images, one for each database engine, to minimize download
and runtime size for folx who need only one engine — especially for production
deployments. Adding <a href="https://alpinelinux.org/" title="Alpine Linux">Alpine</a>-based images also tempts me; they’d be even
smaller, though unable to support most (all?) of the commercial database
engines. Still: tiny!</p>
<p>Container size obsession is a thing, right?</p>
<p>At <a href="https://iovation.com/" title="iovation, Inc.">work</a>, we believe the future of app deployment and execution belongs to
containerization, particularly on Docker and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>. I presume that
conviction will grant me time to work on these improvements.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Well, that and connecting to a service on your
host machine is a little fussy. For example, to use Postgres on your local
host, you can’t connect to Unix sockets. The <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/docker-sqitch/blob/master/docker-sqitch.sh" title="Sqitch Docker Shell Script">shell script</a>
enables <a href="https://docs.docker.com/network/host/" title="Docker documentation: “Use host networking”">host networking</a>, so on Linux, at least, you should be able to
connect to <code>localhost</code> to deploy your changes. On <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/networking/#use-cases-and-workarounds" title="Docker documentation: “Networking features in Docker for Mac”">macOS</a> and <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/networking/#use-cases-and-workarounds" title="Docker documentation: “Networking features in Docker for Windows”">Windows</a>, use
the <code>host.docker.internal</code> host name. <a>↩︎</a></p>

  <p>This week I've been working on making Datasette easier to install, plus wide-ranging improvements to the Datasette GraphQL plugin.</p>
 Datasette and Homebrew 
<p>Datasette is now part of the <a href="https://github.blog/2020-05-06-new-from-satellite-2020-github-codespaces-github-discussions-securing-code-in-private-repositories-and-more/#discussions">GitHub Discussions</a> beta - which means the GitHub repository for the project now has a <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/discussions">Datasette discussions area</a>. I've been wanting to set up somewhere to talk about the project free of pressure to file issues or bug reports for a while, so I'm really excited to have this as a new community space.</p>
<p>One of the first threads there was about <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/discussions/921">Making Datasette easier to install</a>. This inspired me to finally take a look at <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/335">issue #335</a> from July 2018 - "Package datasette for installation using homebrew".</p>
<p>I used the <a href="https://github.com/saulpw/homebrew-vd">VisiData Homebrew Tap</a> as a starting point, along with Homebrew's <a href="https://docs.brew.sh/Python-for-Formula-Authors">Python for Formula Authors</a> documentation. To cut a long story short, <code>brew install datasette</code> now works!</p>
<p>I wrote up some detailed notes on <a href="https://github.com/simonw/til/blob/main/homebrew/packaging-python-cli-for-homebrew.md">Packaging a Python CLI tool for Homebrew</a>. I've also had my <a href="https://sqlite-utils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cli.html">sqlite-utils CLI tool</a> accepted into Homebrew, so you can now install that using <code>brew install sqlite-utils</code> as well.</p>
 datasette install, datasette uninstall 
<p>The updated <a href="https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html">Datasette installation instructions</a> now feature a range of different options: Homebrew, <code>pip</code>, <code>pipx</code> and Docker.</p>
<p><a href="https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/stable/plugins.html">Datasette Plugins</a> need to be installed into the same Python environment as Datasette itself. If you installed Datasette using <code>pipx</code> or Homebrew figuring out which environment that is isn't particularly straight-forward.</p>
<p>So I added two new commands to Datasette (released in <a href="https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-47">Datasette 0.47</a>): <code>datasette install name-of-plugin</code> and <code>datasette uninstall name-of-plugin</code>. These are very thin wrappers around the underlying <code>pip</code>, but with the crucial improvement that they guarantee they'll run it in the correct environment. I derived another TIL from these on <a href="https://github.com/simonw/til/blob/main/python/call-pip-programatically.md">How to call pip programatically from Python</a>.</p>
 datasette --get "/-/versions.json" 
<p>Part of writing a Homebrew package is defining <a href="https://github.com/simonw/til/blob/main/homebrew/packaging-python-cli-for-homebrew.md#implementing-the-test-block">a test block</a> that confirms that the packaged tool is working correctly.</p>
<p>I didn't want that test to have to start a Datasette web server just so it could execute an HTTP request and shut the server down again, so I added a new feature: <a href="https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started.html#datasette-get">datasette --get</a>.</p>
<p>This is a mechanism that lets you execute a fake HTTP GET request against Datasette without starting the server, and outputs the result to the terminal.</p>
<p>This means that anything you can do with the Datasette JSON API is now available on the command-line as well!</p>
<p>I like piping the output to <code>jq</code> to get pretty-printed JSON:</p>
 <code>% datasette github.db --get \
    '/github/recent_releases.json?_shape=array&amp;_size=1' | jq
[
  {
    "rowid": 140912432,
    "repo": "https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils",
    "release": "https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils/releases/tag/2.15",
    "date": "2020-08-10"
  }
]</code> 
 datasette-graphql improvements 
<p>I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Aug/7/datasette-graphql/">introduced datasette-graphql</a> last week. I shipped five new releases since then, incorporating feedback from GraphQL advocates on Twitter.</p>
<p>The most significant improvement: I've redesigned the filtering mechanism to be much more in line with GraphQL conventions. The old syntax looked like this:</p>
 <code>{
  repos(filters: ["license=apache-2.0", "stargazers_count__gt=10"]) {
    edges {
      node {
        full_name
      }
    }
  }
}</code> 
<p>This mirrored how Datasette's table page works (e.g. <a href="https://datasette-graphql-demo.datasette.io/github/repos?license=apache-2.0&amp;stargazers_count__gt=10">repos?license=apache-2.0&amp;stargazers_count__gt=10</a>), but it's a pretty ugly hack.</p>
<p>The new syntax is much, much nicer:</p>
 <code>{
  repos(filter: {license: {eq: "apache-2.0"}, stargazers_count: {gt: 10}}) {
    edges {
      node {
        full_name
      }
    }
  }
}</code> 
<p><a href="https://datasette-graphql-demo.datasette.io/graphql?query=%7B%0A%20%20repos(filter%3A%20%7Blicense%3A%20%7Beq%3A%20%22apache-2.0%22%7D%2C%20stargazers_count%3A%20%7Bgt%3A%2010%7D%7D)%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20edges%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20node%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20full_name%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%7D%0A%20%20%20%20%7D%0A%20%20%7D%0A%7D%0A">Execute this query</a>.</p>
<p>The best part of this syntax is that the columns and operations are part of the GraphQL schema, which means tools like GraphiQL can provide auto-completion for them interactively as you type a query.</p>
<p>Another new feature: <code>tablename_row</code> can be used to return an individual row (actually the first matching item for its arguments). This is a convenient way to access rows by their primary key, since the primary key columns automatically become GraphQL arguments:</p>
 <code>{
  users_row(id: 9599) {
    id
    name
    contributors_list(first: 5) {
      totalCount
      nodes {
        repo_id {
          full_name
        }
        contributions
      }
    }
  } 
}</code> 
<p><a href="https://datasette-graphql-demo.datasette.io/graphql?query=%7B%0A%20%20users_row(id%3A%209599)%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20id%0A%20%20%20%20name%0A%20%20%20%20contributors_list(first%3A%205)%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20totalCount%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20nodes%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20repo_id%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20full_name%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%7D%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20contributions%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%7D%0A%20%20%20%20%7D%0A%20%20%7D%20%0A%7D%0A">Try that query here</a>.</p>
<p>There are plenty more improvements to the plugin detailed in the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/releases">datasette-graphql changelog</a>.</p>
 Write-ahead logging in SQLite 
<p>SQLite's <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html">Write-Ahead Logging</a> feature improves concurrency by preventing writes from blocking reads. I was seeing the occasional "database is locked" error with my personal <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/dogsheep/">Dogsheep</a> so I decided to finally figure out how turn this on for a database.</p>
<p>The breakthrough realization for me (thanks to a question I asked <a href="https://sqlite.org/forum/forumpost/c4dbf6ca17">on the SQLite forum</a>) was that WAL mode is a characteristic of the database file itself. Once you've turned it on for the file, all future connections to that file will take advantage of it.</p>
<p>I wrote about this in a TIL: <a href="https://github.com/simonw/til/blob/main/sqlite/enabling-wal-mode.md">Enabling WAL mode for SQLite database files</a>. I also embedded what I learned in <a href="https://sqlite-utils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v2-15">sqlite-utils 2.15</a>, which now includes <code>sqlite-utils enable-wal file.db</code> and <code>sqlite-utils disable-wal file.db</code> commands (and accompanying Python API methods).</p>
 Datasette 0.46, with a security fix 
<p>Earlier this week I also released <a href="https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-46">Datasette 0.46</a>, with the key feature being a security fix relating to canned queries and CSRF protection.</p>
<p>I used GitHub's security advisory mechanism for this one: <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/security/advisories/GHSA-q6j3-c4wc-63vw">CSRF tokens leaked in URL by canned query form</a>. I've also included detailed information on the exploit (and the fix) in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/918">issue #918</a>.</p>
<p>Also new in 0.46: the <a href="https://latest.datasette.io/-/allow-debug">/-/allow-debug tool</a>, which can be used to experiment with Datasette's <a href="https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/stable/authentication.html#defining-permissions-with-allow-blocks">allow blocks</a> permissions mechanism.</p>

  <p>Summary: Self-sovereign identity, supported by a heterarchical identity metasystem, creates a firm foundation for rich digital relationships that allow people to be digitally embodied so they can act online as autonomous agents.</p>


<a></a>

<p>
    An earlier blog post, <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml">Relationships and Identity</a> proposed that we build digital identity systems to create and manage relationships—not identities—and discussed the nature of digital relationships in terms of their integrity, lifespan, and utility. You should read that post before this one. 
</p>

<p>
    In his article <a href="https://medium.com/@trbouma/architecture-eats-culture-eats-strategy-925c7f3fb74b">Architecture Eats Culture Eats Strategy</a>, Tim Bouma makes the point that the old management chestnut <a href="https://www.managementcentre.co.uk/culture-eats-strategy-for-breakfast/">Culture Eats Strategy</a> leaves open the question: how do we change the culture. Tim's point is that architecture (in the general sense) is the upstream predator to culture. Architecture is a powerful force that drives culture and therefore determines what strategies will succeed—or, more generally, what use cases are possible. 
</p>

<p>
    Following on Tim's insight, my thesis is that identity systems are the foundational layer of our digital ecosystem and therefore the architecture of digital identity systems drives online culture and ultimately what we can do and what we can't. Specifically, since <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml">identity systems are built to create and manage relationships</a>, their architecture deeply impacts the kinds of relationships they support. And the quality of those relationships determines whether or not we live effective lives in the digital sphere. 
</p>

 Administrative Identity Systems Create Anemic Relationships 

<p>
    I was the founder and CTO of iMall, an early, pioneering ecommerce tools vendor. As early as 1996 we determined that we not only needed a shopping cart that kept track of a shopper's purchases in a single session, but one that knew who the shopper was from visit to visit so we could keep the shopping cart and pre-fill forms with shipping and billing addresses. Consequently, we built an identity system. In the spirit of the early web, it was a one-off, written in Perl and storing personal data in Berkeley DB. We did hash the passwords—we weren't idiots1. 
</p>

<p>
    Early Web companies had a problem: we needed to know things about people and there was no reliable way for them to tell us who they were. So everyone built an identity system and thus began my and your journey to collecting thousands of identifiers as the Web expanded and every single site needed it's own way to know things about us.
</p>

<p>
    Administrative identity systems, as these kinds of identity systems are called, create a relationship between the organization operating the identity system and the people who are their customers, citizens, partners, and so on. They are, federation notwithstanding, largely self contained and put the administrator at the center as shown in Figure 1. This is their fundamental architecture. 
</p>


	  <a></a>
	  Figure 1: Administrative identity systems put the administrator at the center.   (click to enlarge)


<p>
    Administrative identity systems are owned. They are closed. They are run for the purposes of their owners, not the purposes of the people or things being administered. They provision and permission. They are bureaucracies for governing something. They rely on rules, procedures, and formal interaction patterns. Need a new password? Be sure to follow the password rules of what ever administrative system you're in. Fail to follow the company's terms of service? You could lose your account without recourse. 
</p>

<p>
    Administrative identity systems use a simple schema, containing just the attributes that the administrator needs to serve their purposes and reduce risk. The problem I and others were solving back in the 90's was legibility2. Legibility is a term used to describe how administrative systems make things governable by simplifying, inventorying, and rationalizing things around them. Identity systems make people legible in order to offer them continuity and convenience while reducing risk for the administrator. 
</p>

<p>
    Administrative identity systems give rise to a systematic inequality in the relationships they manage. Administrative identity systems create bureaucratic cultures. Every interaction you have online happens under the watchful eye of a bureaucracy built to govern the system and the people using it. The bureaucracy may be benevolent, benign, or malevolent but it controls the interaction. 
</p>

<p>
    Designers of administrative identity systems do the imaginative work of assigning identifiers, defining the administrative schemas and processes, and setting the purpose of the identity system and the relationships it engenders. Because of the systematic imbalance of power that administrative identity systems create, administrators can afford to be lazy. To the administrator, everyone is structurally the same, being fit into the same schema. This is efficient because they can afford to ignore all the qualities that make people unique and concentrate on just their business. Meanwhile subjects are left to perform the "interpretive labor" as <a href="https://www.haujournal.org/index.php/hau/article/view/hau2.2.007%22">David Graeber calls it</a> of understanding the system, what it allows or doesn't, and how it can be bent to accomplish their goals.  Subjects have few tools for managing these relationship because each one is a little different, not only technically, but procedurally as well. There is no common protocol or user experience. Consequently, subjects have no way to operationalize the relationship except in whatever manner the administrator allows. 
</p>

<p>
    Given that the architecture of administrative identity systems gives rise to a bureaucratic culture, what kinds of strategies or capabilities does that culture engender? Quoting <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Utopia-Rules-Technology-Stupidity-Bureaucracy-ebook/dp/B00MKZ0QZ2/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=utopia+of+rules&amp;qid=1596487542&amp;sr=8-1">David Graeber from The Utopia of Rules (pg 152)</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>Cold, impersonal, bureaucratic relations are much like cash transactions, and both offer similar advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand they are soulless. On the other, they are simple, predictable, and—within certain parameters, at least—treat everyone more or less the same.
</blockquote>

<p>
    I argue that this is the kind of thing the internet is best at. Our online relationships with ecommerce companies, social media providers, banks, and others are cold and impersonal, but also relatively efficient. In that sense, the web has kept its promise. But the institutionalized frame of action that has come to define it alienates its subjects in two ways:
</p>
 
     They are isolated and estranged from each other. 
     They surrender control over their online activity and the associated data within a given domain to the administrator of that domain.  
 

<p>
    The administrative architecture and the bureaucratic culture it creates has several unavoidable, regrettable outcomes:
</p>
 
     Anemic relationships that limit the capabilities of the systems they support. For example, social media platforms are designed to allow people to form a link (symmetrical or asymmetrical) to others online. But it is all done within the sphere of the administrative domain of the system provider. The relationships in these systems are like two-dimensional cardboard cutouts of the real relationships they mirror. We inhabit multiple walled gardens that no more reflect real life than do the walled gardens of amusement parks.
     
     A surveillance economy that relies on the weak privacy provisions that administrative systems create to exploit our online behavior as the raw material for products that not only predict, but attempt to manipulate, our future behaviors.3 Many administrative relationships are set up to harvest data about our online behavior. The administrator controls the nature of these relationships, what is allowed, and what is behavior is rewarded.
     
     Single points of failure where key parts of our lives are contained within the systems of companies that will inevitably cease to exist someday.  In the words of <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/07/its_the_autonomy_stupid.shtml">Craig Burton</a>: "It's about choice: freedom of choice vs. prescribed options. Leadership shifts. Policies expire. Companies fail. Systems decay. Give me the freedom of choice to minimize these hazards." 
 

 The Self-Sovereign Alternative 

<p>
    <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/06/what_is_ssi.shtml">Self-sovereign identity (SSI) systems</a> offers an alternative model that supports richer relationships. Rather than provisioning identifiers and accounts in an administrative system where the power imbalance assures that one party to the relationship can dictate the terms of the interaction, SSI is founded on peer relationships that are co-provisioned by the exchange of decentralized identifiers. This architecture implies that both parties will have tools that speak a common protocol. 
</p>



	  <a></a>
	  Figure 2: Self-Sovereign Identity Stack (click to enlarge)


<p>
    Figure 2 shows the self-sovereign identity stack. The bottom two layers, the Verifiable Data Repositories and the Peer-to-Peer Agents make up what we refer to as the Identity Metasystem. The features of the metasystem architecture are our primary interest. I have written extensively about the details of the architecture of the metasystem in other posts (see <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/03/the_sovrin_ssi_stack.shtml">The Sovrin SSI Stack</a> and <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/02/decentralized_identifiers.shtml">Decentralized Identifiers</a>). 
</p>

<p>
    The architecture of the metasystem has several important features:
</p>
 
     
        Mediated by protocol—Instead of being intermediated by an intervening administrative authority, activities in the metasystem are mediated through peer-to-peer protocol. Protocols are the foundation of interoperability and allow for scale. Protocols describe the rules for a set of interactions, specifying the kinds of interactions that can happen without being overly prescriptive about their nature or content. Consequently, the metasystem supports a flexible set of interactions that can be adapted for many different contexts and needs.
     
     Heterarchical—Interactions in the metasystem are peer-to-peer rather than hierarchical. The are <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2015/01/re-imagining_decentralized_and_distributed.shtml">not just distributed, but decentralized</a>. Decentralization <a>enables autonomy and flexibility</a> and to assure its independence from the influence of any single actor. No centralized system can anticipate all the various use cases. And no single actor should be allowed to determine who uses the system or for what purposes.
     
     
        Consistent user experience—A consistent user experience doesn’t mean a single user interface. Rather the focus is on the experience. As an example, consider an automobile. My grandfather, who died in 1955, could get in a modern car and, with only a little instruction, successfully drive it. Consistent user experiences let people know what to expect so they can intuitively understand how to interact in any given situation regardless of context.
     
     
        Polymorphic—The information we need in any given relationship varies widely with context. The content that an identity metasystem carries must be flexible enough to support many different situations. 
     
 

<p>
    These architectural features give rise to a culture that I describe as protocological. The protocological culture of the identity metasystem has the following properties:
</p>
 
     Open and permissionless—The metasystem has the same three virtues of the Internet that <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/">Doc Searls</a> and <a href="http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/">Dave Weinberger</a>  <a href="http://www.worldofends.com/#BM_8">enumerated</a>: No one owns it, everyone can use it, and anyone can improve it. Special care is taken to ensure that the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/05/the_impact_of_a_network_of_networks_on_censorship.shtml">metasystem is censorship resistant</a> so that everyone has access. The protocols and code that enable the metasystem are open source and available for review and improvement. 
     
     <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/agentic">Agentic</a>—The metasystem allows allows people to act as autonomous agents, under their <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/cogito_ergo_sum.shtml">self-sovereign authority</a>. The most vital value proposition of self-sovereign identity is autonomy—not being inside someone else's administrative system where they make the rules in a one sided way. Autonomy requires that participants interact as peers in the system, which the architecture of the metasystem supports.
     
     Inclusive—Inclusivity is more than being open and permissionless. Inclusivity requires design that ensures people are not left behind. For example, some people cannot act for themselves for legal (e.g. minors) or other (e.g. refugees) reasons. Support for <a href="https://sovrin.org/guardianship/">digital guardianship</a> ensures that those who cannot act for themselves can still participate. 
     
     Flexible—The metasystem allows people to select appropriate service providers and features. No single system can anticipate all the scenarios that will be required for billions of individuals to live their own effective lives. A metasystem allows for context-specific scenarios.
     
     Modular—An identity metasystem can’t be a single, centralized system from a single vendor with limited pieces and parts. Rather, the metasystem will have interchangeable parts, built and operated by various parties. Protocols and standards enable this. Modularity supports substitutability, a key factor in autonomy and flexibility.
     
     Universal—Successful protocols eat other protocols until only one survives. An identity metasystem based on protocol will have network effects that drive interoperability leading to universality. This doesn't mean that one organization will have control, it means that one protocol will mediate all interaction and everyone in the ecosystem will conform to it. 
     
 

 Supporting Authentic Relationships 
<p>
    Self-sovereign identity envisions digital life that cannot be supported with traditional identity architectures. The architecture of self-sovereign identity and the culture that springs from it support richer, more authentic relationships:
</p>

 
     Self-sovereign identity provides people with the means of operationalizing their online relationships by providing them the tools for acting online as peers and managing the relationships they enter into.  
     Self-sovereign identity, through protocol, allows ad hoc interactions that were not or cannot be imagined a priori. 
 
<p>
    The following subsections give examples for each of these.
</p>


 Disintermediating Platforms 
<p>
    Many real-world experiences have been successfully digitized, but the resulting intermediation opens us to exploitation despite the conveniences. We need digitized experiences that respect human dignity and don't leave us open to being exploited for some company's advantage.  As an example consider how the identity metasystem could be the foundation for a system that <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/06/held_hostage.shtml">disintermediates the food delivery platforms</a>. Platform companies have been very successful in intermediating these exchanges and charging exorbitant rents for what ought to be a natural interaction among peers. 
</p>

<p>
    That's not to say platforms provide no value. The problem isn't that they charge for services, but that their intervening position gives them too much power to make markets and set prices. Platforms provide several things that make them valuable to participants: a means of discovering relevant service providers, a system to facilitate the transaction, and a trust framework to help participants make the leap over the trust gap, as <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/rachel_botsman_we_ve_stopped_trusting_institutions_and_started_trusting_strangers">Rachel Botsman puts it</a>. An identity metasystem supporting self-sovereign identity provides a <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2017/01/a_universal_trust_framework.shtml">universal trust framework</a> for <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/02/building_identity_systems_on_the__sovrin_network.shtml">building systems</a> that can serve as the foundation for creating markets without intermediaries. Such a system with support for a token can even facilitate the transaction without anyone having an intervening position. 
</p>
<p>
    Disintermediating platforms requires creating a peer-to-peer marketplace on top of the metasystem. While the metasystem provides the means of creating and managing the peer-to-peer relationship, defining this marketplace requires determining the messages to be exchanged between participants and creating the means of discovery. These messages might be simple or complex depending on the market and could be <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/06/did_messaging_a_batphone_for_everyone.shtml">exchanged using DIDComm</a>, or even ride on top of a <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/12/verifiable_credential_exchange.shtml">verifiable credential exchange</a>. There might be businesses that provide discovery, but they don't intermediate, they sit to the side of the interaction providing a service. For example, such a business might provide a service that allows a restaurant to define its menu, create a shopping cart, and provide for discovery, but the merchant could replace it with a similar service, providing competition, because the trust interaction and transaction are happening via a protocol built on a universal metasystem. 
</p>
<p>
    Building markets without intermediaries greatly reduces the cost of participating in the market and frees participants to innovate. Because these results are achieved through protocol, we do not need to create new regulations that stifle innovation and lock in incumbents by making it difficult for new entrants to comply. And these systems preserve human dignity and autonomy by removing administrative authorities.
</p>


 Digitizing Auto Accidents 

<p>
    As an example of the the kinds of interactions that people have every day that are difficult to bring into the administrative sphere, consider the interactions that occur between various participants and their representatives following an auto accident. Because these interactions are ad hoc, large parts of our lives have yet to enjoy the convenience of being digitized. In <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/08/youve_had_an_automobile_accident_multi-source_identity_to_the_rescue.shtml">You've Had an Automobile Accident</a>, I imagine a digital identity system that enables the kinds of ad hoc, messy, and unpredictable interactions that happen all the time in the physical world. 
</p>

<p>In this scenario, two drivers, Alice and Bob, have had an accident. Fortunately, no one was hurt, but the highway patrol has come to the scene to make an accident report. Both Alice and Bob have a number of credentials that will be necessary to create the report:</p>

 
     Proof of insurance issued by their respective insurance companies 
     Vehicle title from the state 
     Vehicle registration issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) in different states (potentially) 
     Driver's license, potentially from a different agencies than the one who registers cars and potentially in different states 
 

<p>In addition, the police officer has a credentials from the Highway Patrol, Alice and Bob will make and sign statements, and the police officer will create an accident report. What's more, the owners of the vehicles may not be the drivers. </p>

<p>
    Now imagine you're building a startup to solve the "car accident use case." You imagine a platform to relate to all these participants and intermediate the exchange of all this information. To have value, it has to do more than provide a way to exchange PDFs and most if not all of the participants have to be on it. The system has to make the information usable. How do you get all the various insurance companies, state agencies, to say nothing of the many body shops and hospitals, fire departments, and ambulance companies on board? And yet, these kinds of ad hoc interactions confront us daily.
</p>


 Taking our Rightful Place in the Digital Sphere 

<p>
    Devon Leffreto <a href="https://www.moxytongue.com/2020/07/relationship-structures-matter.html">said something recently</a> that made me think:
</p>
<blockquote>
    You do not have an accurate operational relationship with your Government.
</blockquote>
<p>
    My thought was "not just government". The key word is "operational". People don't have operational relationships anywhere online.4  We have plenty of online relationships, but they are not operational because we are prevented from acting by their anemic natures. Our helplessness is the result of the power imbalance that is inherent in bureaucratic relationships. The solution to the anemic relationships created by administrative identity systems is to provide people with the tools they need to operationalize their self-sovereign authority and act as peers with others online. Scenarios like the ones envisioned in the preceding section happen all the time in the physical world—in fact they're the norm. When we dine at a restaurant or shop at a store in the physical world, we do not do so under some administrative system. Rather, as embodied agents, we operationalize our relationships, whether they be long-lived or nascent, by acting for ourselves. An identity metasystem provides people with the tools they need to be "embodied" in the digital world and act autonomously.
</p>

<p>
    Time and again, various people have tried to create decentralized marketplaces or social networks only to fail to gain traction. These systems fail because they are not based on a firm foundation that allows people to act in relationships with sovereign authority in systems mediated through protocol rather than companies. We have a fine example of a protocol mediated system in the internet, but we've failed to take up the daunting task of building the same kind of system for identity. Consequently, when we act, we do so without firm footing or sufficient leverage. 
</p>

<p>
    Ironically, the internet broke down the walled gardens of CompuServe and Prodigy with a protocol-mediated metasystem, but surveillance capitalism has rebuilt them on the web. No one could live an effective life in an amusement park. Similarly, we cannot function as fully embodied agents in the digital sphere within the administrative systems of surveillance capitalists, despite their attractions. The emergence of self-sovereign identity, agreements on protocols, and the creation of a metasystem to operationalize them promises a digital world where decentralized interactions create life-like online experiences. The identity metasystem and the richer relationships that result from it promise an online future that gives people the opportunity to act for themselves as autonomous human beings and supports their dignity so that they can live an effective online life.
</p>

 

 End Notes 
 
     Two of my friends at the time, Eric Thompson and Stacey Son were playing with FPGAs that could crack hashed passwords, so we were aware of the problems and did our best to mitigate them.  
     See Venkatesh Rao's <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/26/a-big-little-idea-called-legibility/">nice summary</a> of James C. Scott's seminal book on legibility and its unintended consequences, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00D8JJYWA/windleyofente-20">Seeing Like a State</a> for more on this idea.
      See <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N7UERGX/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</a> by Shoshana Zuboff for a detailed (705 page) exploration of this idea.  
     The one exception I can think of to this is email.  People act through email all the time in ways that aren't intermediated by their email provider. Again, it's a result of the architecture of email, set up over four decades ago and the culture that architecture supports.

<p>Firefox was very popular, and Google paid Mozilla a small fortune to make Google search the default in Firefox because it was so popular. But then came Chrome. Why should Google fund Mozilla when Chrome is about 10 times more popular than Firefox, other than out of the goodness of their heart?</p>

<p>It is a very good thing for the world and the web that a truly independent browser exists from a privacy-minded company, but there’s not much of a business model for it unless it’s popular enough to get the dominant search engine to pay for placement.</p>

<p>I pretty much felt the same in the early 2000s, facing down FUD from Microsoft vs. open source. And we … won? Sort of? Except now it’s time to reboot again, because the ad supported web and big tech owned open source is an awkward place to have ended up.</p>

<p>Shopify is an absolute massive ecosystem. Blending crowdfunding with straight up sales is a really powerful way to more directly own your platform for the long term, whereas one-off Kickstarters you immediately need to plan for off-platform websites, sales, communications, etc.:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Kickstarter is an excellent way to run a crowdfunding campaign. But if you already have a community built up, and have communication channels in place (via a newsletter, for example), and already run an online shop, then Kickstarter can be unnecessarily cumbersome. Kickstarter’s 10% fee is also quite hefty. By leaning on Shopify’s flexible Liquid templating system and reasonable CC processing fees, an independent publisher running a campaign can save some ~$7,000 for every $100,000 of sales by using Craigstarter instead of Kickstarter. That’s materially meaningful, especially in the world of books.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is particularly relevant because I’m in the midst of learning more about how to run and setup Shopify stores, both for work, and ideally for some side projects. Gathering interest from a group of people so we can collectively fund / buy things is exactly the kind of thing I want to do.</p>

   Responding to @Tobie’s thread on examining open source as a commons. 

 In the context of digital abundance, the open source code itself can be infinitely copied. 

 1) open source code = public good 

 2) support, maintenance, etc. = common good 

 3) paying customers = common good (assuming multiple consultants or hosting services etc.)

  <p>Responding to <a href="https://twitter.com/tobie/status/1292720548846469120">@Tobie’s thread on examining open source as a commons</a>.</p>

<p>In the context of digital abundance, the open source code itself can be infinitely copied.</p>

<p>1) open source code = public good</p>

<p>2) support, maintenance, etc. = common good</p>

<p>3) paying customers = common good (assuming multiple consultants or hosting services etc.)</p>

<p>From my understanding of <a href="https://dri.es/balancing-makers-and-takers-to-scale-and-sustain-open-source">@Dries’ Makers and Takers post</a>, the distinction between a public good which can’t be depleted and a common good which can be, and must be protected, is key.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The activity around open source code is a common good. It is provided by the maintainers and other contributors. @tobie mentions maintenance, but also documentation, marketing, communication, responding to issues, and so on.</p>

<p>The “consumers” of these activities may evolve into new contributors, so in one model providing this activity will grow the commons. And even the add to the public good of the code if the new contributors eventually provide code, too.</p>

<p>But taking time for these activities is a scarce resource, as Tobie points out. Sponsorship and similar types of funding can potentially “buy” more of a maintainer’s time, so they can provide more support for (2) – but isn’t really a business model or a commons management strategy on its own.</p>

<p>Finally, my third point from above. Dries made this point quite clearly: if you have multiple businesses built around an open source code base, the (paying) customers are a common good: they can (mostly) only be the customer of one business.</p>

<p>Approaches that restrict aspects of a project to paying users run the risk of making this no longer a common or public good, and yet <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/t/governing-the-commons-the-evolution-of-institutions-for-collective-action-elisabeth-ostrom-1990/46">Ostrom</a> mostly proved that “good fences make good neighbours”. This is the challenge we face that @tobie highlights, and the ongoing experimental phase that I see open source at large moving into.</p>

<p>For a sustainable commons that goes beyond code, we need more makers than takers.</p>

  <p>Summary: Sovereign is the right word for describing the essential distinction between our inalienable self and the administrative identifiers and attributes others assign to us online.</p>


<a></a>


<p>
    Descartes didn't <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum">say</a> "I have a birth certificate, therefore I am." We do not spring into existence because some administrative system provisions an identifer for us. No single administrative regime, or even a collection of them, defines us. <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/">Doc Searls</a> said this to me recently:
</p>
<blockquote>We are, within ourselves, what <a href="https://poets.org/poem/invictus">William Ernest Henley calls</a> “the captain” of “my unconquerable soul”, and what <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7200015-i-know-i-am-deathless-i-know-this-orbit-of">Walt Whitman meant</a> when he said “I know this orbit of mine cannot be swept by a carpenter's compass,” and “I know that I am august. I do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself or be understood.” Each of us has an inner essence that is who we are.
</blockquote>

<p>
    Even in the digital realm, and limiting ourselves to what <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot7-toronto/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/five-mental-models-of-identity.md">Joe Andrieu calls</a> "functional identity", we are more than any single <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml">relationship</a>. Our identity is something we are, not something we have. And it's certainly not what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_provider">someone else provides</a> to us. We are self-sovereign. 
</p>

<p>
    Some shrink from the self-sovereign label. There are some good reasons for their reluctance. Self-sovereignty requires some explanation. And it has political overtones that make some uncomfortable. But I've decided to embrace it. Self-sovereign identity is more than decentralized identity. Self-sovereign identity implies autonomy and inalienability. 
</p>

<p>
    If our identity is inalienable, then it's <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/inalienable">not transferable to another and not capable of being taken away or denied</a>. To be inalienable is to be sovereign: to exercise supreme authority over one’s personal sphere—Whitman’s “orbit of mine.” Administrative identifiers, what others choose to call us, are alienable. Relationships are alienable. Most attributes are alienable1. Who we are, and our right to choose how we present ourselves to the world, is not alienable.  The distinction between the inalienable and the alienable, the self-sovereign and the administrative, is essential. Without this distinction, we are constantly at the mercy of the various administrative regimes we interact with. 
</p>

<p>
    Self-sovereignty is concerned with relationships and boundaries. When we say a nation is sovereign, we mean that it can act as a peer to other sovereign states, <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/10/self_sovereign_is_not_self_asserted.shtml">not that it can do whatever it wants</a>. Sovereignty defines the source of our authority to act. Sovereignty defines a boundary, within which the sovereign has complete control and outside of which the sovereign relates to others within established rules and norms. Self-sovereign identity defines the boundary in the digital space, gives tools to people and organizations so they can assert control—their autonomy, and defines the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml">rules for how relationships are formed, authenticated, and used</a>. 
</p>

<p>
    In the opening chapter of her groundbreaking book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N7UERGX/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</a>, Shoshana Zuboff asks the question "Can the digital future be our home?" Not if it's based on administrative identity systems and the anemic, ofttimes dangerous, relationships they create. By starting with self-sovereignty, we found our digital relationships on principles that support and preserve human freedom, privacy, and dignity. So, while talking about trust, decentralization, credentials, wallets, and DIDs might help explain how self-sovereign identity works, sovereignty explains why we do it. If self-sovereignty requires explanation, maybe that's a feature, not a bug. 
</p>

 
 End Notes 
 
     I'm distinguishing attributes from traits without going too deep into that idea for now.

I loved technology - I learned to write in BASIC at the same time as English - but it was always at its best when it was in service of a story. I wrote small text adventure games and built simple animations.</p><p>Those were the programs that captured my imagination, too: <a href="https://www.usgamer.net/articles/i-actually-was-hunting-ewoks-lucasfilm-games-the-early-years">LucasArts</a> adventure games like <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/9bg7dv/the-secret-of-monkey-island-is-still-everything-i-want-in-video-games-049">The Secret of Monkey Island</a> and adventures like Infocom's <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/1g84m0sXpnNCv84GpN2PLZG/the-game-30th-anniversary-edition">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a>, which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy_(video_game)">Douglas Adams himself had helped write</a>. They were stories, first and foremost, which happened to be enabled by technology.</p><p>I wanted to be a writer.</p><p>I still do.</p><p>The pandemic has led to many changes in my life. I spend most of my time in Santa Rosa, working remotely as the Head of Engineering for <a href="https://forusall.com">ForUsAll</a> during the day and helping to care for my mother when I'm not behind my laptop. In some ways, I consider myself perversely lucky: her decline has coincided with a time that I'm able to work from anywhere. The hit to my personal life aside, it's worked out pretty well.</p><p>But I need something else - something that's mine, beyond the demands of my job and caring for my family. I've decided to give myself the gift of making space for my first love. I won't say exactly what I'm working on (I don't want to jinx it), but I've spent the summer taking classes and workshops on improving my plot and character skills. My aim is to have a first draft written by the end of November - and who knows what will happen after that.</p><p>It's been interesting to juxtapose the needs of plot and character with the product work I do every day. While the former is built from imagination, and the latter from research, they're oddly similar skills. Every product can be described in the framework of a three act structure; <a href="https://werd.io/2020/plot-and-startups">every target user has internal and external motivations</a> that form the basis of a compelling solution.</p><p>But that's not why I'm turning my attention to writing. I'm doing it because telling stories is something I find joy in. It's not to make a living or to improve my day job. It's not even because I think I'll be good at it (because, to be absolutely honest, I don't know).</p><p>It's none of those things. It's simply because I want to - and that's more than enough. It's something I can control, that allows me to be meditative and creative, that nobody can touch. And right now in particular, that couldn't be more valuable to me.</p>

  I’ve been systematically working through all the open issues filed about the OpenID Connect Logout specs in preparation for advancing them to Final Specification status.

<p>I’ve been systematically working through all the open issues filed about the OpenID Connect Logout specs in preparation for advancing them to Final Specification status.  I’m pleased to report that I’ve released drafts that address all these issues.  The new drafts are:</p>
 
 <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-rpinitiated-1_0-01.html">OpenID Connect RP-Initiated Logout 1.0 – draft 01</a> 
 <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-session-1_0-30.html">OpenID Connect Session Management 1.0 – draft 30</a> 
 <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-frontchannel-1_0-04.html">OpenID Connect Front-Channel Logout 1.0 – draft 04</a> 
 <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-backchannel-1_0-06.html">OpenID Connect Back-Channel Logout 1.0 – draft 06</a> 
 
<p>The OpenID Connect working group waited to make these Final Specifications until we received feedback resulting from certification of logout deployments.  Indeed, this feedback identified a few ambiguities and deficiencies in the specifications, which have been addressed in the latest edits.  You can see the certified logout implementations at <a href="https://openid.net/certification/">https://openid.net/certification/</a>.  We encourage you to likewise certify your implementations now.</p>
<p>Please see the latest History entries in the specifications for descriptions of the normative changes made.  The history entries list the issue numbers addressed.  The issues can be viewed in the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/openid/connect/issues?status=new&amp;status=open">OpenID Connect issue tracker</a>, including links to the commits containing the changes that resolved them.</p>
<p>All are encouraged to review these drafts in advance of the formal OpenID Foundation review period for them, which should commence in a few weeks.  If you believe that changes are needed before they become Final Specifications, please file issues describing the proposed changes.  Discussion on the <a href="mailto:openid-specs-ab@lists.openid.net">OpenID Connect mailing list</a> is also encouraged.</p>
<p>Special thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/RolandHedberg">Roland Hedberg</a> for writing the initial logout certification tests.  And thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/_panva">Filip Skokan</a> for providing resolutions to two of the thornier Session Management issues.</p>

  <p>This week I've mostly been building <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql">datasette-graphql</a>, a plugin that adds GraphQL query support to Datasette.</p>

<p>I've been <a href="https://simonwillison.net/search/?q=graphql">mulling this over</a> for a couple of years now. I wasn't at all sure if it would be a good idea, but it's hard to overstate how liberating Datasette's plugin system has proven to be: plugins provide a mechanism for exploring big new ideas without any risk of taking the core project in a direction that I later regret.</p>

<p>Now that I've built it, I think I like it.</p>

 A GraphQL refresher 

<p><a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a> is a query language for APIs, first promoted by Facebook in 2015.</p>

<p>(Surprisingly it has nothing to do with the Facebook Graph API, which predates it by several years and is more similar to traditional REST. A third of respondents to my <a href="https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1289381085181140992">recent poll</a> were understandably confused by this.)</p>

<p>GraphQL is best illustrated by an example. The following query (a real example that works with <code>datasette-graphql</code>) does a whole bunch of work:</p>

  Retrieves the first 10 repos that match a search for "datasette", sorted by most stargazers first  Shows the total count of search results, along with how to retrieve the next page  For each repo, retrieves an explicit list of columns  <code>owner</code> is a foreign key to the <code>users</code> table - this query retrieves the <code>name</code> and <code>html_url</code> for the user that owns each repo  A repo has issues (via an incoming foreign key relationship). The query retrieves the first three issues, a total count of all issues and for each of those three gets the <code>title</code> and <code>created_at</code>.  

<p>That's a lot of stuff! Here's the query:</p>

 <code>{
  repos(first:10, search: "datasette", sort_desc: stargazers_count) {
    totalCount
    pageInfo {
      endCursor
      hasNextPage
    }
    nodes {
      full_name
      description
      stargazers_count
      created_at
      owner {
        name
        html_url
      }
      issues_list(first: 3) {
        totalCount
        nodes {
          title
          created_at
        }
      }
    }

 datasette-graphql 

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql">datasette-graphql</a> plugin adds a <code>/graphql</code> page to any Datasette instance. It exposes a GraphQL field for every table and view. Those fields can be used to select, filter, search and paginate through rows in the corresponding table.</p>

<p>The plugin detects foreign key relationships - both incoming and outgoing - and turns those into further nested fields on the rows.</p>

<p>It does this by using table introspection (powered by <a href="https://sqlite-utils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/python-api.html#introspection">sqlite-utils</a>) to dynamically define a schema using the <a href="https://graphene-python.org/">Graphene</a> Python GraphQL library.</p>

<p>Most of the work happens in the <code>schema_for_datasette()</code> function in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/blob/main/datasette_graphql/utils.py">datasette_graphql/utils.py</a>. The code is a little fiddly because Graphene usually expects you to define your GraphQL schema using classes (similar to Django's ORM), but in this case the schema needs to be generated dynamically based on introspecting the tables and columns.</p>

<p>It has a solid set of unit tests, including some <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/tree/main/examples">test examples</a> written in Markdown which double as further documentation (see <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/blob/950ca0740a658780cdd3a91e4bbfdda4f48645ea/tests/test_graphql.py#L62-L74">test_graphql_examples()</a>).</p>

 GraphiQL for interactively exploring APIs 

<p><a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphiql">GraphiQL</a> is the best thing about GraphQL. It's a JavaScript interface for trying out GraphQL queries which pulls in a copy of the API schema and uses it to implement really comprehensive autocomplete.</p>

<p><code>datasette-graphql</code> includes GraphiQL (inspired by <a href="https://www.starlette.io/graphql/">Starlette's implementation</a>). Here's an animated gif showing quite how useful it is for exploring an API:</p>

<p></p>

<p>A couple of tips: On macOS option+space brings up the full completion list for the current context, and command+enter executes the current query (equivalent to clicking the play button).</p>

 Performance notes 

<p>The most convenient thing about GraphQL from a client-side development point of view is also the most nerve-wracking from the server-side: a single GraphQL query can end up executing a LOT of SQL.</p>

<p>The example above executes at least 32 separate SQL queries:</p>

  1 select against repos (plus 1 count query)  10 against issues (plus 10 counts)  10 against users (for the <code>owner</code> field)  

<p>There are some optimization tricks I'm not using yet (in particular the <a href="https://docs.graphene-python.org/en/latest/execution/dataloader/">DataLoader pattern</a>) but it's still cause for concern.</p>

<p>Interestingly, SQLite may be the best possible database backend for GraphQL due to the characteristics explained in the essay <a href="https://sqlite.org/np1queryprob.html">Many Small Queries Are Efficient In SQLite</a>.</p>

<p>Since SQLite is an in-process database, it doesn't have to deal with network overhead for each SQL query that it executes. A SQL query is essentially a C function call. So the flurry of queries that's characteristic for GraphQL really plays to SQLite's unique strengths.</p>

<p>Datasette has always featured arbitrary SQL execution as a core feature, which it protects using query time limits. I have an <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/issues/33">open issue</a> to further extend the concept of Datasette's time limits to the overall execution of a GraphQL query.</p>

 More demos 

<p>Enabling a GraphQL instance for a Datasette is as simple as <code>pip install datasette-graphql</code>, so I've deployed the new plugin in a few other places:</p>

 Future improvements 

<p>I have a bunch of <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/issues">open issues</a> for the plugin describing what I want to do with it next. The most notable <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/issues/16">planned improvement</a> is adding support for Datasette's canned queries.</p>

<p>Andy Ingram <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewingram/status/1289624490037530625">shared the following</a> interesting note on Twitter:</p>

<blockquote><p>The GraphQL creators are (I think) unanimous in their skepticism of tools that bring GraphQL directly to your database or ORM, because they just provide carte blanche access to your entire data model, without actually giving API design proper consideration.</p></blockquote>

<p>My plugin does exactly that. Datasette is a tool for publishing raw data, so exposing everything is very much in line with the philosophy of the project. But it's still smart to put some design thought into your APIs.</p>

<p><a href="https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/stable/sql_queries.html#canned-queries">Canned queries</a> are pre-baked SQL queries, optionally with parameters that can be populated by the user.</p>

<p>These could map directly to GraphQL fields. Users could even use plugin configuration to turn off the automatic table fields and just expose their canned queries.</p>

<p>In this way, canned queries can allow users to explicitly design the fields they expose via GraphQL. I expect this to become an extremely productive way of prototyping new GraphQL APIs, even if the final API is built on a backend other than Datasette.</p>

 Also this week 

<p>A couple of years ago I wrote a piece about <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2018/Apr/25/register-members-interests/">Exploring the UK Register of Members Interests with SQL and Datasette</a>. I finally got around to automating this using GitHub Actions, so <a href="https://register-of-members-interests.datasettes.com/">register-of-members-interests.datasettes.com</a> now updates with the latest data every 24 hours.</p>

<p>I renamed <code>datasette-publish-now</code> to <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-publish-vercel">datasette-publish-vercel</a>, reflecting Vercel's name change from Zeit Now. Here's <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-publish-vercel/issues/26">how I did that</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-insert">datasette-insert</a>, which provides a JSON API for inserting data, defaulted to working unauthenticated. MongoDB and Elasticsearch have taught us that insecure-by-default inevitably leads to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/07/more-than-1000-databases-have-been-nuked-by-mystery-meow-attack/">insecure deployments</a>. I fixed that: the plugin now requires authentication, and if you don't want to set that up and know what you are doing you can install the deliberately named <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-insert-unsafe">datasette-insert-unsafe</a> plugin to allow unauthenticated access.</p>

 <p>Is this the way you want your brand to look?</p> 
<p>Digital advertising needs to sniff its own stench, instead of everybody’s digital butts.</p>
<p>A sample of that stench is wafting through the interwebs from&nbsp; the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ana.net/content/show/id/ResponsibleAddressableMedia">Partnership for Responsible Addressable Media</a>, an ad industry bullphemism for yet another way to excuse the urge to keep tracking people against their wishes (and simple good manners) all over the digital world.</p>
<p>This new thing is a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granfalloon">granfalloon</a> conjured by the <a href="https://www.ana.net/about">Association of National Advertisers</a>&nbsp;(aka the <a href="https://www.ana.net/">ANA</a>) and announced today in the faux-news style of the press release (which it no doubt also is) at the first link above. It begins,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AD INDUSTRY LAUNCHES “PARTNERSHIP FOR RESPONSIBLE ADDRESSABLE MEDIA” TO ENSURE FUTURE OF DIGITAL MEDIA FOR BUSINESSES &amp; CONSUMERS<br>
Governing Group of Industry Leaders Includes 4A’s, ANA, IAB, IAB Tech Lab, NAI, WFA, P&amp;G, Unilever, Ford, GM, IBM, NBCUniversal, IPG, Publicis, Adobe, LiveRamp, MediaMath, The Trade Desk</p>
<p>NEW YORK (August 4, 2020) — Leading trade associations and companies representing every sector of the global advertising industry today joined together to launch the Partnership for Responsible Addressable Media, an initiative to advance and protect critical functionalities like customization and analytics for digital media and advertising, while safeguarding privacy and improving the consumer experience. The governing group of the Partnership will include the most influential organizations in advertising.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I learned about this from&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/wendyndavis">@WendyDavis</a>, who wrote&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/354347/ad-industry-launches-new-organization-will-push-g.html">this piece</a> in <a href="https://www.mediapost.com/">MediaPost</a>.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/">NiemanLab</a> summarizes what she reports with a <a href="https://twitter.com/NiemanLab/status/1290690368573526016">tweet</a> that reads, “A new ad-industry group will lobby Google and Apple to let them track users just a wee bit more, please and thank you.”</p>
<p>Writes Wendy,</p>
<blockquote><p>The group will soon reach out to browser developers and platforms, in hopes of convincing them to rethink recent decisions that will limit tracking, according to Venable attorney Stu Ingis, who will head the legal and policy working group.</p>
<p>“These companies are taking huge positions that impact the entire economy — the entire media ecosystem — with no real input from the media ecosystem,” Ingis says.</p></blockquote>
<p>As if the “entire media ecosystem” doesn’t contain the billions of humans being tracked.</p>
<p>Well, here’s a fact: ad blocking, which was already the <a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2015/09/28/beyond-ad-blocking-the-biggest-boycott-in-human-history/">biggest boycott in world history</a>&nbsp;five years ago, didn’t happen in a vacuum. Even though ad blockers had been available since 2004, use of them didn’t hockey-stick until 2012-13, exactly when adtech and its dependents in publishing gave the middle finger to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track">Do Not Track</a>, which was nothing more than a polite request, expressed by a browser, for some damn privacy while we go about our lives online. See <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/11/ad-blockers-and-the-next-chapter-of-the-internet">this</a> in Harvard Business Review:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here’s another fact: the browser makers actually care about their users, some of whom are paying customers (for example with Apple and Microsoft). They know what we want and need, and are giving it to us. Demand and supply at work.</p>
<p>The GDPR and the CCPA also didn’t happen in a vacuum. Both laws were made to protect citizens from exactly what adtech (tracking based advertising) does. And, naturally, the ad biz has been working mightily to obey the letter of those laws while violating their spirit. Why else would we be urged by cookie notices everywhere to “accept” exactly what we’ve made very clear that we don’t want?</p>
<p>So here are some helpful questions from the world’s billions to the brands now paying to have us followed like marked animals:</p>
<p>Have you noticed that not a single brand known to the world has been created by tracking people and aiming ads at them—even after spending a $trillion or two on doing that?</p>
<p>Have you noticed that nearly all the world’s major brands became known through advertising that not only didn’t track people, but <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/advertising-30">sponsored</a> <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2019/09/01/journalism-2/">journalism</a> as well?</p>
<p>Have you noticed that tracking people and directing personalized messages at them—through “addressable media”—is in fact direct marketing, which we used to call junk mail?</p>
<p>Didn’t think so.</p>
<p>Time to get the clues, ad biz. Brands too.</p>
<p>Start with&nbsp;<a href="http://cluetrain.com">The Cluetrain Manifesto</a>, which says, if you only have time for one clue this year, this is the one to get…</p>
<p>we are not seats or eyeballs or end users or consumers.<br>
we are human beings — and our reach exceeds your grasp.<br>
deal with it.</p>
<p>That year was 1999.</p>
<p>If advertising and marketing had bothered to listen back then, they might not be dealing today with the GDPR, the CCPA, and the <a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/the-adblock-war/">earned dislike</a> of billions.</p>
<p>Next, please learn (or re-learn) the difference between real advertising and the junk message business. Find that lesson in&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@dsearls/separating-advertisings-wheat-and-chaff-47858adfcb20#.i6msx57rv">Separating Advertising’s Wheat and Chaff</a>. An excerpt:</p>
<blockquote><p>See, adtech did not spring from the loins of Madison Avenue. Instead its direct ancestor is what’s called&nbsp;direct response marketing. Before that, it was called&nbsp;direct mail, or&nbsp;junk mail. In metrics, methods and manners, it is little different from its closest relative, spam.</p>
<p>Direct response marketing has always wanted to get personal, has always been data-driven, has never attracted the creative talent for which Madison Avenue has been rightly famous.&nbsp;<a>Look up&nbsp;best ads of all time</a>&nbsp;and you’ll find nothing but wheat. No direct response or adtech postings, mailings or ad placements on phones or websites.</p>
<p>Yes, brand advertising has always been data-driven too, but the data that mattered was how many people were exposed to an ad, not how many clicked on one — or whether you, personally, did anything.</p>
<p>And yes, a lot of brand advertising is annoying. But at least we know it pays for the TV programs we watch and the publications we read. Wheat-producing advertisers are called “sponsors” for a reason.</p>
<p>So how did direct response marketing get to be called advertising ? By looking the same. Online it’s hard to tell the difference between a wheat ad and a chaff one.</p>
<p>Remember the movie “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_the_Body_Snatchers">Invasion of the Body Snatchers</a>?” (Or the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_the_Body_Snatchers_%281978_film%29">remake by the same name</a>?) Same thing here. Madison Avenue fell asleep, direct response marketing ate its brain, and it woke up as an alien replica of itself.</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s what had happened to the ANA in 2018, when it <a href="https://www.martechadvisor.com/news/display-and-native-advertising/ana-association-of-national-advertisers-to-acquire-data-and-marketing-association/">acquired</a>&nbsp;what had been the Direct Marketing Association (aka DMA) and which by then called itself the&nbsp;Data &amp; Marketing Association.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ana.net/content/show/id/ResponsibleAddressableMedia">Partnership for Responsible Addressable Media</a>&nbsp;speaks in the voice of advertising’s alien replica. It does not “safeguard essential values in advertising as a positive economic force.” Instead it wants to keep using “addressable” advertising as the primary instrument of surveillance capitalism.</p>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/theagency/what-if-we-don-t-need-advertising-at-all-cf8ae123f2d3#.r2dr769a8">Maybe it’s too late</a>&nbsp;to save advertising from its alien self. But perhaps not, if what’s left of advertising’s soul takes the writings of&nbsp;<a href="https://adcontrarian.blogspot.com/">Bob Hoffman</a>&nbsp;(<a href="https://twitter.com/adcontrarian">@AdContrarian</a>) to heart. That’s the only way I know for advertising to clean up its act.</p>

<p>Every so often, I'm asked to look over a startup pitch deck. I'm no longer investing, but if I have bandwidth and I think the elevator pitch is interesting, I'm happy to provide advice.<br><br>The team slide is, of course, the most important part of any pitch, because the people in your team are the most important part of any startup. Lately, I've seen the same problem again and again.<br><br>Here's a lesson I learned a long time ago, the hard way: in a startup, everyone has to bring something important to the table that meaningfully pushes the organization forward. The people who just want to tell people what to do, or who are there because having a startup is cool, add burn, slow you down, and reduce your chances for success.</p><p>That might sound like obvious advice, but over the years, I've encountered a lot of people who want to play-act working on a startup. They performatively hustle and talk the talk, looking and sounding the part, but when the rubber meets the road, they fall flat. They have the political and interpersonal skills, but they can't build.<br><br>Having an idea is not bringing to the table; neither is running a meeting; nor is strategy alone. You've got to make and build, bringing all of your skills and creativity together to actually create something from more or less nothing. Crafting a concrete experience is bringing something to the table. Building a process to repeatably sell is bringing something to the table. Writing and maintaining code is bringing something to the table. Telling other people what to do is not. And you've got to make sure those dynamics, that bias towards action and focus on execution, is a core part of your company culture and how you think about running the business.<br><br>It can get nasty. Sometimes, I've even seen non-builders actively try and subjugate the makers in an organization in order to cover for their own shortcomings. In larger companies, organizational politics are an inevitable if uncomfortable part of life, but these kinds of games can kill a startup very quickly. (65% of startups fail because of preventable human dynamics.) Founders need to watch for the politicians and the talkers, and optimize for the people who are not just willing and able to get their hands dirty, but willing and able to make that their entire job.<br><br>One of the most common mistakes I've seen in people who move from larger organizations to found startups is to build an organization out of people managers, and then outsource the making part. In effect, the blood and sweat and DNA of your service gets outsourced, while the only people in the office are talkers. It's absurd, and it belies a dismissive attitude towards building things that is orthogonal to success. At one startup I met, someone referred to the engineering team as "the back-room guys". Who would want to join that team?<br><br>If your team isn't able to make meaningful progress without outsourcing its work, it's the wrong team. That might not be true when you have a larger corporation's resources at your disposal - although I'm not convinced that it's not - but it's certainly true when you need to build something at speed.<br><br>Here's how it came out in the people slide of one deck I recently read. The entire founding team had MBAs and high-level management backgrounds, with no other applicable skills. (The best way to list those is describe what you've built in the past.) Inevitably, the team slide also proudly declared which schools they had graduated from. It couldn't be a bigger red flag: there was nothing to say they could actually build the startup they were proposing. Nobody had ever designed a user experience or written a line of code. To reiterate, it's not alone. This was far from the first startup I've seen - or the hundredth - that had the same problem.<br><br>The bottom line is: if you can't say definitively why you're the right team to build (not ideate, not strategize, not pitch, but build) this startup, then you need to stop kidding yourself and find something else to do. It's harsh advice, but in an environment where entrepreneurs are the new rock stars, a lot of people seem to want to cut corners and get famous (such as it is) without putting in the work. The truth is, there are no corners to be cut, and a startup made of people managers will inevitably fail. There is no alternative to building.</p>

<p>This post is just a record of the key insights I took away from Sam Harris’ enlightening <a href="https://samharris.org/podcasts/211-the-nature-of-human-nature/">talk with Robert Plomin</a>.</p>
<p>I sure wish it were easier to capture and embed these kinds of audio segments, and to do so more effectively — ideally with transcription. It was way too much work to construct the URLs that deliver these segments into the embedded players I’ve included here, even with the <a href="http://jonudell.net/av/audio.html?url=https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/wakingup/Making_Sense_211_Plomin2028Paywall29.mp3&amp;startmin=58&amp;startsec=52&amp;endmin=62&amp;endsec=0">tool I made</a> for that purpose. It’s nice to have a standard embedded player, finally, but since it doesn’t show the endpoints of the segments you can’t tell they’re each just a few minutes. It looks like they all run to the end.</p>
<p>I wound up going to more trouble than it’s probably worth to convey the most memorable parts of that excellent podcast, and I don’t have time to transcribe more fully, but for what it’s worth, here are the segments that I’ll be remembering.</p>
<p>1. “The most important thing we’ve learned from the DNA revolution in the last 10 years is that genetic influences on complex traits are due to thousands of tiny DNA differences.”<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>2. “These polygenic scores are perfectly normally distributed.”<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>3. “I’m saying there are no disorders, there are just quantitative dimensions.”</p>

<p>Zeynep Tufekci, in <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/07/why-arent-we-talking-more-about-airborne-transmission/614737/" title="We Need to Talk About Ventilation">a piece</a> for The Atlantic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jimenez also wondered why the National Guard hadn’t been deployed to set up
tent schools (not sealed, but letting air in like an outdoor wedding canopy)
around the country, and why the U.S. hadn’t set up the mass production of HEPA
filters for every classroom and essential indoor space. Instead, one
air-quality expert reported, teachers who wanted to buy portable HEPA filters
were being told that <a href="https://twitter.com/Poppendieck/status/1286300608836907009">they weren’t allowed</a> to, because the CDC wasn’t
recommending them. It is still difficult to get Clorox wipes in my
supermarket, but I went online to check, and there is no shortage of portable
HEPA filters. There is no run on them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s the profoundly irresponsible plan to reopen schools without any remotely
sufficient attempt to upgrade and modernize the air circulation systems of our
dilapidated public school buildings that disturbs me. Meanwhile, school
reopening proposals pay undue attention to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/07/scourge-hygiene-theater/614599/" title="Hygiene Theater Is a Huge Waste of Time">hygiene theater</a> to assuage fears,
while very real risks go largely unaddressed.<a>1</a> It simply won’t
work, and that means disastrous outcomes for communities.</p>
<p>And it’s not like there aren’t ways to get things under better control. Tufekci
continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, Japan masked up early, focused on <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32611985/" title="Cluster-based approach to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) response in Japan-February-April 2020">super-spreader events</a> (a strategy
it calls “<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-japan-beat-coronavirus-without-lockdowns-11594163172" title="How Japan Beat Coronavirus Without Lockdowns">cluster busting</a>”), and, crucially, trained its public to focus on
avoiding the three C’s—closed spaces, crowded places, and close conversations.
In other words, exactly the places where airborne transmission and aerosols
could pose a risk. The Japanese were advised not to talk on the subway, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-japan-has-long-accepted-covids-airborne-spread-and-scientists-say-ventilation-is-key/" title="Japan has long accepted COVID's airborne spread, and scientists say ventilation is key">where
windows were kept open</a>. Oshitani said they also developed guidelines that
included the importance of ventilation in many different settings, such as
bars, restaurants, and gyms. Six months later, despite having some of the
earliest outbreaks, ultradense cities, and one of the oldest populations in
the world, Japan has had about 1,000 COVID-19 deaths total—which is how many
the United States often has in a single day. Hong Kong, a similarly dense and
subway-dependent city, has had only 24 deaths.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The U.S. needs to get it shit together. We have the wealth and knowledge to do
this right, but need to put empathy for each other ahead of temporary political
and economic impacts to do so.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>In fairness, the <a href="https://www.schools.nyc.gov/school-year-20-21/return-to-school-2020/health-and-safety">Health and Safety</a> section the New York
City DOE’s <a href="https://www.schools.nyc.gov/school-year-20-21/return-to-school-2020">Return to School 2020-2021</a> plan says that the “DOE will make
improvements to HVAC systems, as well as air conditioning repairs, to improve
air circulation, as well as replacing regular air filters with higher
efficiency types.” Still, there’s a social failing here, national leaders
ought to fund the upgrading of air circulation systems to the highest
standards in every school and classroom in the United States. <a>↩︎</a></p>

   How a Cheese Goes Extinct 
 Ruby Tandoh writes for the New Yorker about the culture, history and anthropology of cheesemaking through the lens of the British cheese industry. I learned that two of my favourite British cheeses - Tymsboro and Innes Log, have sadly ceased production. Beautifully written.

  <p>Summary:      We build digital identity systems to create and manage relationships—not identities. We need our digital relationships to have integrity and to be useful over a specified lifetime. Identity systems should provide relationship integrity and utility to participants for the appropriate length of time. Participants should be able to create relationships with whatever party will provide utility. SSI provides improved support for creating, managing, and using digital relationships.</p>


<a></a>

<p>
    The most problematic word in the term <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/06/what_is_ssi.shtml">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)</a> isn't "sovereign" but "identity" because whenever you start discussing identity, the conversation is rife with unspoken assumptions. Identity usually conjures thoughts of authentication and various federation schemes that purport to make authentication easier. I frequently point out that even though SSI has "identity" in it's name, there's no artifact in SSI called an "identity." Instead the user experience in an SSI system is based on forming relationships and using credentials.
</p>

<p>
    I've been thinking a lot lately about the role of relationships in digital identity systems and have come to the conclusion that we've been working on building building systems that support digital relationships without acknowledging the importance of relationships or using them in our designs and architectures.  The reason we build identity systems isn't to manage identities, it's to support digital relationships. 
</p>
<p>
    I recently read and then reread a 2011 paper called <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2163241">Identities Evolve: Why Federated Identity is Easier Said than Done</a> from <a href="https://www.constellationr.com/users/steve-wilson">Steve Wilson</a>. Despite being almost ten years old, the paper is still relevant, full of good analysis and interesting ideas. Among those is the idea that the the goal of using federation schemes to create a few identities that serve all purposes is deeply flawed. Steve's point is that we have so many identities because we have have lots of relationships. The identity data for a given relationship is contextual and highly evolved to fit its specific niche. 
</p>

<p>
    Steve's discussion reminded me of a <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/samramji/darwins-finches-20th-century-business-and-apis/119">talk Sam Ramji used to give about speciation of APIs</a>. Sam illustrated his talk with a picture from <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/evolution-scientific-theory/Adaptive-radiation">Encyclopedia Britannica</a> to show adaptive radiation in Galapagos finches in response to evolutionary pressure. These 14 different finches all share a common ancestor, but ended up with quite different features because of specialization for a particular niche.
</p>

	<a></a>
	Adaptive radiation in Galapagos finches (click to enlarge)

<p>
    In the same way, each of us have hundreds, even thousands, of online relationships. They each have a common root but are highly contextualized. Some are long-lived, some are ephemeral. Some are personal, some are commercial. Some are important, some are trivial. Still, we have them. The information about ourselves, what many refer to as identity data, that we share with each is just as adapted to the specific niche that the relationship represents as the Galapagos finches are to their niches. Once you realize this, the idea of creating a few online identities to serve all needs becomes preposterous. 
</p>

<p>
    Not only is each relationship evolved for a particular niche, but it is also constantly changing. Often those changes are just more of what's already there. For example, my Netflix account represents a relationship between me and Netflix. It's constantly being updated with my viewing data but not changing dramatically in structure. But some changes are larger. For example, it also allows me to create additional profiles which makes the relationship specialized for the specific members of my household. And when Netflix moved from DVDs only to streaming, the nature of my relationship with Netflix changed significantly.
</p>

<p>
    I'm convinced that identity systems would be better architected if we were more intentional about their need to support specialized relationships spanning millions of potential relationship types. This article is aimed at better understanding the nature of digital relationships.
</p>

 Relationships 

<p>
    One of the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2017/10/fixing_the_five_problems_of_internet_identity.shtml">fundamental problems of internet identity</a> is proximity. Because we're not interacting with people physically, our natural means of knowing who we're dealing with are useless. <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot7-toronto/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/five-mental-models-of-identity.md">Joe Andrieu defines identity</a> as "how we recognize, remember, and respond" to another entity. These three activities correspond to three properties digital relationships must have to overcome the proximity problem: 
</p>
 
     Integrity—we want to know that, from interaction to interaction, we're dealing with the same entity we were before. In other words, we want to identify them. 
     Lifespan—normally we want relationships to be long-lived, although we also create ephemeral relationships for short-lived interactions.  
     Utility—we create online relationships in order to use them within a specific context. 
 

<p>
    We'll discuss each of these in detail below, followed by a discussion of risk in digital relationships.
</p>

 Relationship Integrity 

<p>
    Without integrity, we cannot recognize the other party to the relationship. Consequently, all identity systems manage relationship integrity as a foundational capability. Federated identity systems improve on one-off, often custom identity systems by providing integrity in a way that reduces user management overhead for the organization, increases convenience for the user, and increases security by eliminating the need to create one-off, proprietary solutions. SSI aims to establish integrity with the convenience of the federated model but without relying on an intervening IdP in order to provide autonomy and privacy. 
</p>

<p>
    A relationship has two parties, let's call them P1 and P2.1 P1 is connecting with P2 and, as a result, P1 and P2 will have a relationship. P1 and P2 could be people, organizations, or things represented by a website, app, or service. Recognizing the other party in an online relationship relies on being able to know that you're dealing with the same entity each time you encounter them. 
</p>

<p>
    In a typical administrative identity system, when P1 initiates a relationship with P2, P2 typically uses usernames and passwords to ensure the integrity of the relationship. By asking for a username to identify P1 and a password to ensure that it's the same P1 as before, P2 has some assurance that they are interacting with P1. In this model, P1 and P2 are not peers. Rather P2 controls the system and determines how and for what it is used. 
</p>

<p>
    In a federated flow, P1 is usually called the subject or consumer and P2 is called the relying party (RP). When the consumer visits the RP's site or opens their app, they are offered the opportunity to establish a relationship through an identity provider (IdP) whom the RP trusts. The consumer may or may not have a relationship with an IdP the RP trusts. RPs pick well-known IdPs with large numbers of users to reduce friction in signing up. The consumer chooses which IdP they want to use from the relying party's menu and is redirected to the IdP's identity service where they present a username and password to the IdP, are authenticated, and redirected back to the RP. As part of this flow, the RP gets some kind of token from the IdP that signifies that the IdP will vouch for this person. They may also get attributes that the IdP has stored for the consumer.2  
</p>

<p>
    In the federated model, the IdP is identifying the person and attesting the integrity of the relationship to the RP. The IdP is a third party, P3, who acts as an intervening administrative authority. Without their service, the RP may not have an alternative means of assuring themselves that the relationship has integrity over time. On the other hand, the person gets no assurance from the identity system about relationship integrity in this model. For that they must rely on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">TLS</a>, which is visible in a web interaction, but largely hidden inside an app on a mobile device.  P1 and P2 are not peers in the federated model. Instead, P1 is subject to the administrative control of both the IdP and the RP. Further, the RP us subject to the administrative control of the IdP. 
</p>

<p>
    In SSI, a relationship is initiated when P1 and P2 exchange <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/02/decentralized_identifiers.shtml">decentralized identifiers</a> (DID). For example, when a person visits a web site or app, they are presented with a connection invitation. When they accept the invitation, they use a software agent to share a DID that they created. In turn, they receive a DID from the web site, app, or service.  We call this a "connection" since DIDs are cryptographically based and thus provide a means of both parties mutually authenticating. The user experience does not necessarily surface all this activity to the user. To get a feel for the user experience, run through the <a href="https://try.connect.me">demo at Connect.me</a>3.
</p>

<p>
    In contrast to the federated model, the participants in SSI mutually authenticate and the relationship has integrity without the intervention of a third party. By exchanging DIDs both parties have also exchanged public keys. They can consequently use cryptographic means to ensure they are interacting with the party who controls the DID they received when the relationship was initiated. Mutual authentication, based on self-initiated DIDs provides SSI relationships with inherent integrity. <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2016/10/on_sovereignty.shtml">P1 and P2 are peers in SSI</a> since they both have equal control over the relationship. 
</p>

<p>
    In addition to removing the need for intermediaries to vouch for the integrity of the relationship, the peer nature of relationships in SSI also means that neither party has access to the authentication credentials of the other. Mutual authentication means that each party manages their own keys and never shares the private key with another party. Consequently, attacks, like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21326200/elon-musk-bill-gates-twitter-hack-bitcoin-scam-compromised">recent attack on Twitter accounts</a> can't happen in SSI because there's no administrator who has access to the credentials of everyone using the system. 
</p>

 Relationship Lifespan 

<p>
    Whether in the physical world or digital, relationships have lifespans. Some relationships are long-lived, some are short-term, and others are ephemeral, existing only for the duration of a single interaction. We typically don't think of it this way, but every interaction we have in the physical world, no matter for what purpose or how short, sets up a relationship. So too in the digital world, although our tools, especially as people online, have been sorely lacking. 
</p>

<p>
    I believe one of the biggest failings of modern digital identity systems is our failure to recognize that people often want, even need, short-lived relationships. Think about your day for a minute. How many people and organizations did you interact with in the physical world4 where you established a permanent relationship? What if whenever you stopped in the convenience store for a cup of coffee, you had to create a permanent relationship with the coffee machine, the cashier, the point of sale terminal, and the customers in line ahead and behind you? Sounds ridiculous. But that's what most digital interactions require. At every turn we're asked to establish permanent accounts to transact and interact online. 
</p>

<p>
    There are several reasons for this. The biggest one is that every Web site, app, or service wants to send you ads, at best, or track you on other sites, at worst. Unneeded, long-lived relationships are the foundation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism">surveillance economy</a> that has come to define the modern online experience. 
</p>

<p>
    There are a number of services I want a long-lived relationship with. I value my relationships with Amazon and Netflix, for example. But there are many things I just need to remember for the length of the interaction. I ordered some bolts for a car top carrier from a specialty place a few weeks ago. I don't order bolts all the time, so I just want to place my order and be done. I want an ephemeral relationship. The Internet of Things will increase the need for ephemeral relationships. When I open a door with my digital credential, I don't want the hassle of creating a long-term relationship with it; I just want to open the door and then forget about it. 
</p>

<p>
    Digital relationships should be easy to set up and tear down. They should allow for the relationship to grow over time, if both parties desire. While they exist, they should be easily managable while providing all the tools for the needed utility. Unless there's long term benefit to me, I shouldn't need to create a long term relationship. And when a digital relationship ends, it should really be over. 
</p>



 Relationship Utility 

<p>
    Obviously, we don't create digital relationships just so we can authenticate the other party. Integrity is a necessary, but insufficient, condition for an identity system.  This is where most identity models fall short. We can understand why this is so given the evolution of the modern Web. For the most part, user-centric identity really took off when the web gave people reasons to visit places they didn't have a physical relationship with, like an ecommerce web site. Once the identity system had established the integrity of the relationship, at least from the web site's perspective, we expected HTTP would provide the rest.
</p>

<p>
    Most Identity and Access Management systems don't provide much beyond integrity except possibly access control. Once Facebook has established who you are, it knows just what resources to let you see or change.  But as more and more of our lives are intermediated by digital services, we need more utility from the identity system than simple access control. The most that an IdP can provide in the federated model is integrity and, perhaps, a handful of  almost-always-self-asserted attributes in a static, uncustomizable schema. But rich relationships require much more than that.
</p>

<p>
    Relationships are established to provide utility. An ecommerce site wants to sell you things. A social media site wants to show you ads. Thus, their identity systems, built around the IAM system, are designed to do far more than just establish the integrity of the relationship. They want to store data about you and your activities. For the most part this is welcome. I love that Amazon shows me my past orders, Netflix remembers where I was in a series, and Twitter keeps track of my followers and past tweets. 
</p>

<p>
    The true identity system is much, much larger and specialized than the IAM portion. All of the account or profile data these companies use is properly thought of as part of the identity system that they build and run. Returning to <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot7-toronto/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/five-mental-models-of-identity.md">Joe Andrieu</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>Identity systems acquire, correlate, apply, reason over, and govern [the] information assets of subjects, identifiers, attributes, raw data, and context.
</blockquote>
<p>
    Regardless of whether or not they outsource the integrity of their relationships (and notice that none of the companies I list above do), companies still have to keep track of the relationships they have with customers or users in order to provide the service they promise. They can't outsource this to a third party because the data in their identity system has evolved to suit the needs of the specific relationship. We'll never have a single identity that serves all relationships because they are unique contexts that demand their own identity data. Rip out the identity system from a Netflix or Amazon and it won't be the same company anymore.
</p>

<p>
    This leads us to a simple, but important conclusion: You can't outsource a relationship. Online apps and services decorate the relationship with information they observe, and use that information to provide utility to the relationships they administer. Doing this, and doing it well is the foundation of the modern web. 
</p>

<p>
    Consequently, the bad news is that SSI is not going to reduce the need for companies to <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/02/building_identity_systems_on_the__sovrin_network.shtml">build, manage, and use identity systems</a>. Their identity systems are what make them what they are—there is no "one size fits all" model. The good news is that SSI makes online relationships richer. Relationships are easier and less expensive to manage, not just for companies, but for people too. Here's some of the ways SSI will enhance the utility of digital relationships:
</p>

 
     Richer, more trustworthy data—Relationships change over time because the parties change. We want to reliably ascertain facts about the other party in a relationship, not just from direct observation, but also from third parties in a trustworthy manner to build confidence in the actions of the other party within a specific context. <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/12/verifiable_credential_exchange.shtml">Verifiable credentials</a>, self-issued or from others, allow relationships to be enhanced incrementally as the relationships matures or changes. 
     
     Autonomy and choice through peer relationships—Peer relationship give each party more autonomy than traditional administrative identity systems have provided. And, through standardization and substitutability, SSI gives participants choice in what vendors and agents they employ to manage their relationships. The current state of digital identity is asymmetric, providing companies with tools that are difficult or unwieldy for people to use. People like <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/">Doc Searls</a> and organizations like <a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/vrm/2019/05/13/me2b-2/">Project VRM</a> and the <a href="https://www.me2b.us">Me2B Alliance</a> argue that people need tools for managing online relationships too. SSI provides people with tools and <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/07/its_the_autonomy_stupid.shtml">autonomy</a> to manage their online relationships with companies and each other. 
     
     Better, more secure communications—DID exchange provides a <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/06/did_messaging_a_batphone_for_everyone.shtml">private, secure messaging channel</a> using the <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html">DIDComm protocol</a>. This messaging channel is mutually recognized, authenticated, and encrypted. 
     Unifying, interoperable protocol for data transmission—DIDs and Verifiable Credentials, and DIDComm provides a standardized, secure means of interaction. Just like URLs, HTML, and HTTP provided for an interoperable web that led to an explosion of uses, the common protocol of SSI will ensure everyone benefits from the network effects. 
     
     Consistent user experience—Similarly, SSI provides a consistent user experience, regardless of what digital wallet people use. SSI's user experience is centered on relationships and credentials, not arcane addresses and keys. The user experience mirrors the experience people have of managing credentials in the physical world. 
     
     Support for ad hoc digital interactions—The real world is messy and unpredictable. <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/08/youve_had_an_automobile_accident_multi-source_identity_to_the_rescue.shtml">SSI is flexible enough to support the various ad hoc scenarios</a> that the world presents us and supports sharing multiple credentials from various authorities in the ways the scenario demands.
     
 

<p>
    These benefits are delivered using an architecture that provides a common, interoperable layer, called the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/08/life-like_identity_why_the_internet_needs_an_identity_metasystem.shtml">identity metasystem</a>, upon with <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/02/building_identity_systems_on_the__sovrin_network.shtml">anyone can build the identity systems they need</a>. A ubiquitous identity layer for the internet must be a metasystem that provides the building blocks and protocols necessary for others to build identity systems that meet the needs of any specific context or domain. An identity metasystem is a prerequisite for an online world where identity is as natural as it is in the physical world. An identity metasystem can remove friction, decrease cognitive overload, and make online interactions more private and secure.
</p>

 Relationships, Risk, and Trust 

<p>
    Trust is a popular term in the SSI community. People like Steve Wilson and <a href="https://identitywoman.net/about-kaliya/bio/">Kaliya Young</a> rightly ask about risk whenever someone in the identity community talks about trust. Because of the proximity problem, digital relationships are potentially risky. One of the goals of an identity system is to provide evidence that can be used in the risk calculation.

<p>
    In their excellent paper, <a href="https://philarchive.org/rec/NICTAR-2">Risk and Trust</a>, Nickel and Vaesen define trust as the "disposition to willingly rely on another person or entity to perform actions that benefit or protect oneself or one’s interests in a given domain." From this definition, we see why crypto-proponents often say "To trust is good, but to not trust is better." The point being that not having to rely on some other human, or human-mediated process is more likely to result in a beneficial outcome because it reduces the risk of non-performance. 
</p>

<p>
    Relationships imply a shared domain, context, and set of activities. We often rely on third parties to tell us things relevant to the relationship. Our vulnerability, and therefore our risk, depends on the degree of reliance we have on another party's performance.  Relationships can never be "no trust" because of the very reasons we create relationships. Bitcoin, and similar systems, can be low or no trust precisely because the point of the system is to reduce the reliance on any relationship at all. The good news, is the architecture of the SSI stack significantly limits the ways we must rely on external parties for the exchange of information via verifiable credentials and thus reduces the vulnerability of parties inside and outside of the relationship. The SSI identity metasystem clearly delineates the parts of the system that are low trust and those where human processes are still necessary. 
</p>

<p>
    The exchange of verifiable credentials can be split into two distinct parts as shown in the following diagram. SSI reduces risk in remote relationships using the properties of these two layers to combine cryptographic processes with human processes. 
</p>

<p>
    The bottom layer, labeled Identity Metasystem, comprises two components: a set of verifiable data repositories for storing metadata about credentials and a processing layer supported by protocols and practices for the transport and validation of credentials. Timothy Ruff <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/verifiable-credentials-arent-credentials-they-re-containers-fab5b3ae5c0">uses the analogy of shipping containers</a> to describe the identity metasystem. Verifiable credentials are analogous to shipping containers and the metasystem is analogous to the shipping infrastructure that makes intermodal shipping so efficient and secure. The Identity Metasystem provides a standardized infrastructure that similarly increases the efficiency and security of data interchange via credentials. 
</p>

<p>
    The top layer, labeled Identity Systems, is where people and organizations determine what credentials to issue, determine what credentials to seek and hold, and determine which credentials to accept. This layer comprises the individual credential exchange ecosystems that spring up and the governance processes for managing those credential ecosystems. In Timothy's analogy to shipping containers, this layer is about the data—the cargo—that the credential is carrying.
</p>

<p>
    The Identity Metasystem allows verifiable credentials can be cryptographically checked to ensure four key properties that relate to the risk profile. 
</p>
 
     Who issued the credential? 
     Was the credential issued to the party presenting it? 
     Has the credential been tampered with? 
     Has the credential been revoked? 
 
<p>
    These checks show the fidelity of the credential and are done without the verifier needing a relationship with the issuer. And because they're automatically performed by the Identity Metasystem, they significantly reduce the risk related to using data transferred using verifiable credentials. This is the portion of credential exchange that could be properly labeled "low or no trust" since the metasystem is built on standards that ensure the cryptographic verifiability of fidelity without reliance on humans and human-mediated processes. 
</p>

<p>
    The upper, Identity Systems, layer is different. Here we are very much relying on the credential issuer. Some of the questions we might ask include:
</p>
 
     Is the credential issuer, as shown by the identifier in the credential, the organization we think they are? 
     Is the organization properly accredited in whatever domain they're operating in?  
     What data did the issuer include in the credential? 
     What is the source of that data? 
     How has that data been processed and protected?  
 

<p>
    These questions are not automatically verifiable in the way we can verify the fidelity of a credential. They are different for each domain and perhaps different for each type of relationship based on the vulnerability of the parties to the data in the credential and their appetite for risk. Their answers depend on the provenance of the data in the credential. We would expect to see credential verifier's perform provenance checks by answering these and other questions during the process they use to establish trust in the issuer. Once the verifier has established this trust, the effort needed to evaluate the provenance of the data in a credential should cease or be greatly reduced.  
</p>

<p>
    As parties in a relationship share data with each other, the credential verifier will spend effort evaluating the provenance of issuers of credentials they have not previously evaluated. Once that is done, the metasystem will provide fidelity checks on each transaction. For the most part, SSI does not impose new ways of making these risk evaluations. Rather, most domains already have processes for establishing the provenance of data. For example, we know how to determine if a bank is a bank, the accreditation status of a university, and the legitimacy of a business. Companies with heavy reliance on properties of their supply chain, like pharmaceuticals, already have processes for establishing the provenance of the supply chain. For the most part, verifiable credential exchange will faithfully present digital representations of the kinds of physical world processes, credentials, and data we already know how to evaluate.  Consequently, SSI promises to significantly reduce the cost of reducing risk in remote relationships without requiring wholesale changes to existing business practices. 
</p>

 Conclusion 

<p>
    Relationships have always been the reason we created digital identity systems. Our historic focus on relationship integrity and IAM made modern Web 2.0 platforms and services possible, but has limited use cases, reduced interoperability, and left people open to privacy and security breaches. By focusing on peer relationships supported by an Identity Metasystem, SSI not only improves relationships integrity but also better supports flexible relationship lifecycles, more functional, trustworthy relationship utility, and provides tools for participants to correctly gauge, respond to, and reduce risks inherent in remote relationships.

 Notes 
 
     For simplicity, I'm going to limit this discussion to two-party relationships, not groups. 
     I've described federation initialization very generally here and left out a number of details that distinguish various federation architectures.  
     Connect.me is just one of a handful of digital wallets that support the same SSI user experience. Others vendors include <a href="https://trinsic.id/">Trinsic</a>, <a href="https://idramp.com/">ID Ramp</a>, and <a href="https://self-ssi.com/en/">eSatus AG</a>.

  Public Radio: What is the best NPR station in the country? That’s a question on Quora I thought needed answering. So I did, with this: Here’s a quantitative answer to your qualitative question:&nbsp;WVPS&nbsp;of&nbsp;Vermont Public Radio. Because, in&nbsp;Nielsen’s Audio Ratings, it scores a 12.6 in&nbsp;its home market of Burlington, and a 16.2 in its neighbor market […]

 <p>Radio is moving from these to servers of streams and podcasts.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.quora.com/Public-Radio-What-is-the-best-NPR-station-in-the-country">Public Radio: What is the best NPR station in the country</a>? That’s a question on Quora I thought needed answering. So I did, with this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Here’s a quantitative answer to your qualitative question:&nbsp;<a title="en.wikipedia.org" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WVPS">WVPS</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a title="www.vpr.org" href="https://www.vpr.org/#stream%2F0">Vermont Public Radio</a>. Because, in&nbsp;<a title="ratings.radio-online.com" href="https://ratings.radio-online.com/cgi-bin/rol.exe/arb_menu_rank">Nielsen’s Audio Ratings</a>, it scores a 12.6 in&nbsp;<a title="ratings.radio-online.com" href="https://ratings.radio-online.com/cgi-bin/rol.exe/arb505">its home market of Burlington</a>, and a 16.2 in its neighbor market of<a title="ratings.radio-online.com" href="https://ratings.radio-online.com/cgi-bin/rol.exe/arb432">&nbsp;Montpelier-Waterbury</a>. Far as I know, those are tops among all the country’s NPR-affiliated stations.</p>
<p>Honorable mentions go to WUOM&nbsp;<a title="ratings.radio-online.com" href="https://ratings.radio-online.com/cgi-bin/rol.exe/arb581">in Ann Arbor</a>&nbsp;with a 13.0, KCLU&nbsp;<a title="ratings.radio-online.com" href="https://ratings.radio-online.com/cgi-bin/rol.exe/arb591">in Santa Barbara</a>&nbsp;with a 10.2—plus others you’ll find if you follow the links in&nbsp;<a title="blogs.harvard.edu" href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2019/04/04/public/">Where Public Radio Rocks</a>, which I published in April of last year. All the numbers I sourced have changed since then, but they’re easy to find at the links I provided.</p>
<p>In the long run, however, “best” will come to mean&nbsp;which stations, producers and distributors are best at streaming and podcasting. Because that’s where listening is headed. Vermont Public Radio makes that clear on their own website, which appends “#stream/0” to its URL when you go there—and does its best, on the site, to encourage listening over-the-net rather than just over-the-air.</p>
<p>At this point in history, nearly all radio stations already stream, for a good reason: in the digital world, where every one of us with a smartphone and a data plan has the best radio ever made, antique broadcast virtues such as “range” and “coverage” have become bugs. This is why, when my family drove around Spain in a rental car last summer, we listened to KCLU from our home town of Santa Barbara, piped from one of our phones through the car’s entertainment system (which is no longer called a “radio”). It’s also why, when I’m up early on the West Coast, I often listen to WBUR from Boston or WNYC from New York, my other home towns. (I get around—or at least I did before the plague.)</p>
<p>The streaming numbers in Nielsen’s ratings are still low, but they are growing, and in many markets exceed the numbers for nearly all the remaining AM stations. For example, in&nbsp;<a title="ratings.radio-online.com" href="https://ratings.radio-online.com/content/arb015">the latest ratings for Washington, DC,</a>&nbsp;36 stations are listed: 33 FM, 2 streams and 2 AM. Those are drawn from a roster of 52 FM and 35 AM stations with listenable signals in Washington (according to&nbsp;<a title="radio-locator.com" href="http://radio-locator.com/">radio-locator.com</a>)—and 6 of those FM signals are translators for AM stations, including the two AMs that show in the ratings (which means that even the ratings for AM stations were likely for those stations’ FM signals).</p>
<p>Also, while&nbsp;streaming&nbsp;is the big trend for&nbsp;stations,&nbsp;podcasting&nbsp;is the big trend for&nbsp;programming, aka “content.” Podcasting is exploding now, and earning ever-larger slices of the listening pie, which is a finite sum of people’s time. Podcasting wins at this because it has far more optionality than live over-the-air radio. You can listen when you like, slide forward and backward through a show, jump past ads or skip over topics you’d rather miss, and listen at 1.5x or 2x the normal speed. Those are huge advantages.</p>
<p>It’s also not for nothing that SiriusXM just paid $325 for Stitcher (<a title="variety.com" href="https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/siriusxm-buys-stitcher-325-million-1234704617/#!">says Variety)</a>, and not long before that Spotify&nbsp;<a title="www.msn.com" href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/tv/news/joe-rogan-signs-exclusive-100-million-podcast-deal-with-spotify/ar-BB14jDHC">paid $100 million</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<a title="en.wikipedia.org" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Rogan">Joe Rogan</a>’s podcast and (<a title="www.businessinsider.com" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/spotify-ringer-deal-price-250-million-podcasting-bill-simmons-report-2020-2">according to Business Inside</a>r) nearly $200 million for&nbsp;<a title="www.theringer.com" href="https://www.theringer.com/">The Ringer</a>&nbsp;and “nearly $400 million in recent purchases of Gimlet Media, Anchor, and Parcast.”</p>
<p>For that kind of money you could buy every AM and FM station in New York or Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Noncommercial players are also looking pretty good in the podcasting world as well.&nbsp;<a title="analytics.podtrac.com" href="http://analytics.podtrac.com/industry-rankings/">According to Podtrac</a>, NPR is the #1 podcast publisher and PRX is #5. Also showing well are WNYC Studios, This American Life/Serial and American Public Media. NPR also has 9 of&nbsp;<a title="analytics.podtrac.com" href="http://analytics.podtrac.com/industry-rankings/">the top 20 podcasts</a>. In fact the majority (11) of those top 20 are from public radio sources.</p>
<p>Off the top of my head, the public stations with head starts in podcast production are WBEZ in Chicago, WBUR in Boston, WNYC in New York, KQED in San Francisco, KPCC and KCRW in Los Angeles and others you’ll hear credited when they open or close a show.</p>
<p>But it’s early. Expect lots of change in the coming months and years as many podcast creators, producers and distributors jockey for positions in two races. One is the free public one, syndicated by&nbsp;<a title="en.wikipedia.org" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</a>&nbsp;on the open Internet and ready to hear on any browser, app or device. The other is the private subscription one, available only through the owner’s services. This is clearly where SiriusXM and Spotify are both going. SiriusXM is audible only by subscription, while Spotify remains $free (for now) but exclusive. (For example, Michelle Obama’s&nbsp;<a title="open.spotify.com" href="https://open.spotify.com/show/71mvGXupfKcmO6jlmOJQTP">new podcast</a>&nbsp;is available only on Spotify.) This split, between free/open and paid/closed, will be a big story over the coming years.</p>
<p>So, in the meantime, hats off to Vermont Public Radio for being the top public radio operation in the country—at least in its markets’ ratings. And stay tuned for the fights among players in streaming and podcasting.</p></blockquote>
<p>I expect VPR will continue being the alpha broadcasting, streaming and podcasting service in its home state, both because it does a great job and because Vermont is very much a collection of communities that have come to depend on it.</p>
<p>And, if you want to know why I think journalism of the fully non-fake kind has a last (or first) refuge in the most local forms, dig <a href="https://tedxsantabarbara.com/2018/doc-searls/">The story isn’t the whole story</a>, my TEDx talk about that.</p>

<p>The topic of adding JWT support to Django core comes up occasionally - here's James Bennett's detailed argument for not doing that. The short version is that the JWT specification isn't just difficult to implement securely: it's fundamentally flawed, which results in things like five implementations in three different languages all manifesting the same vulnerability. Third party modules exist that add JWT support to Django, but baking it into core would act as a form of endorsement and Django's philosophy has always been to encourage people towards best practices.</p>

<p>This should have been a tweet. But the format was not&nbsp;fitting.</p><p>The promise of a personal decentralized identity is that the trust component involved in your use of credentials in the real world can be replicated online. In the real world, when you present your driving license to a law enforcement officer during a periodical check, the officer checks its validity and legitimacy by looking at specific features on your driving license. Since they are a trained eye, the error rate in verifying your document is lower than what a layman would have and the accuracy even better when the officer is aided by tools such as UV light to check for holograms and other security features. Once they are satisfied with your document, you can proceed with your business or transaction at&nbsp;hand.</p><p>It may seem straightforward that the scenario described is replicable digitally. If the interaction between you and an academic officer or a law enforcement officer was digital, you would send a scanned copy of your driving license or school leaving certificate over email or through an online portal. Once submitted, they verify security features on the documents and either involve a senior officer or send them to a verifying body to ascertain authenticity. This takes time and before you get a confirmation that your document was approved, and that you can proceed with your intended activity, days are gone not to mention the opportunity cost involved.</p><p>While that has been largely the case in our regular interactions involving using our identifying documents and issued credentials, the bottlenecks can be minimized to make processes smoother. We should note that the document, the primary actor in the entire interaction/exchange is not truly digital. It is a scan, an image or a photograph of your certificate or license. You and I (the humans) can read and make out the information contained there. Computers cannot. We are in 2020. Computers should. If your documents were machine readable, computer systems that handle them would be able to process the information, and heck, even verify the information by themselves. Some documents today are machine readable and make information systems very efficient. But there should be a way to make this the new&nbsp;normal.</p><p>Enter Verifiable Credentials (VCs). An open standard that forward thinking technologists and organizations, after facing the frustrations described and seeing the potential value being locked up in non-machine-verifiable documents, came up with under the World Wide Web Consortium (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C</a>). Verifiable Credentials support machine-to-machine communication and their proofs (security features) can be verified cryptographically using the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). Issuing and Verifying authorities have their work made easier as they can independently check a common registry for proofs regarding the individual and the credential presented. There is no need for a third party to countercheck where the Mathematical proofs are well implemented and the registry, once written on is tamper proof. Such a database could be a blockchain or a sufficiently consensus driven distributed ledger.</p>Figure 1: Exchange of Verifiable Credentials between Issuer, Holder, and Verifier.<p>Why should you care? Well, in this COVID-19 era, we are all trying to avoid unnecessary human contact. Because of Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt, even documents are being quarantined if physical copies are exchanged and more services now insist on digital forms of documents. That’s where Verifiable Credentials come in. It should be possible, once available, that a certificate proving you have been vaccinated against corona virus or that you graduated from university remotely, is shared as a Verifiable Credential. One noteworthy forward thinking initiative that is working on making this a reality is the <a href="https://www.covidcreds.com/">COVID-19 Credentials Initiative</a> (CCI). Vibranium ID is a part of it. The work of the initiative is not restricted to the pandemic as a reactive response but is a basis as to how we can unlock the promise of Verifiable Credentials.</p><p>Fun fact: After the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L7V2mXWUO5fjiwJODyq_wMvkL9EDSf3m7emLxLpvzTk/edit#">Governance Framework (GF) of the CCI</a> approved the CCI GF, three Kenyan software developers (Mbora Maina, Amos Kibet, Chris Achinga) and I translated the document into <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ejnylgHi-A_nZeZrnwBjaWzhjPIDq8ETMMJiiwKZbm0/edit?usp=sharing">Kiswahili</a>. The translation gives context as to the practicability of VCs in the real&nbsp;world.</p><p>Innovation waits for no man. The pandemic has proved so. The adjustment brought by this disease has surely made some processes redundant and will bring gamechanging technologies to the foreground.

  <p>This week I've been mainly experimenting with binary data storage in SQLite. sqlite-utils can now insert data from binary files, and datasette-media can serve content over HTTP that originated as binary BLOBs in a database file.</p>

<p>Paul Ford piqued my interest in this when he tweeted about loading thousands of PDF documents into a SQLite database:</p>

<blockquote><p>I made a shell script that loads thousands of PDF docs into SQLite databases. That means I can have a web server that produces infinite randomly chosen US Military PowerPoint slides that I can scroll on my phone when I'm around the house. <a href="https://t.co/n3zUlbCuBB">pic.twitter.com/n3zUlbCuBB</a></p>— Paul Ford (@ftrain) <a href="https://twitter.com/ftrain/status/1287183861785473027?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 26, 2020</a></blockquote>

<p>The SQLite documentation claims that serving smaller binary files from BLOB columns can be <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/fasterthanfs.html">35% faster than the filesystem</a>. I've done a little bit of work with binary files in SQLite - the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-render-binary">datasette-render-binary</a> and <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-render-images">datasette-render-images</a> both help display BLOB data - but I'd never really dug into it in much detail.</p>

 sqlite-utils insert-files 

<p>The first step was to make it easier to build database files that include binary data.</p>

<p><a href="https://sqlite-utils.readthedocs.io/">sqlite-utils</a> is my combination Python library and CLI tool for building SQLite databases. I've been steadily evolving it for a couple of years now, and it's the engine behind my <a href="https://dogsheep.github.io/">Dogsheep</a> collection of tools for personal analytics.</p>

<p>The new <a href="https://sqlite-utils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cli.html#inserting-binary-data-from-files">insert-files command</a> can be used to insert content from binary files into a SQLite database, along with file metadata.</p>

<p>The most basic usage looks like this:</p>

 <code>sqlite-utils insert-files gifs.db images *.gif</code> 

<p>By default, this creates a database table like so:</p>

 <code>CREATE TABLE [images] (
    [path] TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    [content] BLOB,
    [size] INTEGER
);</code> 

<p>You can customize this table to include other file metadata using the <code>-c</code> (short for <code>--column</code>) option:</p>

 <code>sqlite-utils insert-files gifs.db images *.gif \
    -c path -c md5 -c last_modified:mtime -c size --pk=path</code> 

<p>This creates a table with the following schema:</p>

 <code>CREATE TABLE [images] (
    [path] TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    [md5] TEXT,
    [last_modified] FLOAT,
    [size] INTEGER
);</code> 

<p>If you pass a directory instead of a file name the command will recursively add every file in that directory.</p>

<p>I also improved <code>sqlite-utils</code> with respect to outputting binary data. The new <code>--raw</code> option dumps the binary contents of a column directly to standard out, so you can read an image back out of one of the above tables like so:</p>

 <code>sqlite-utils photos.db \
    "select content from images where path=:path" \
    -p path 'myphoto.jpg' \
    --raw &gt; myphoto.jpg</code> 

<p>This example also demonstrates the new support for <code>:parameters</code> passed using the new <code>-p</code> option, see <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils/issues/124">#124</a>.</p>

<p><code>sqlite-utils</code> usually communicates using JSON, but JSON doesn't have the ability to represent binary values. Datasette outputs binary values <a href="https://datasette-render-images-demo.datasette.io/favicons/favicons.json?_shape=array&amp;_size=1">like so</a>:</p>

 <code>"data": {
  "$base64": true,
  "encoded": "iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABAAAAAQCAY..."
}</code> 

<p>I added support for the same format to <code>sqlite-utils</code> - so you can now query binary columns and get out that nested object, or pipe JSON with that nested structure in to <code>sqlite-utils insert</code> and have it stored as a binary BLOB in the database.</p>

 datasette-media 

<p><a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-media">datasette-media</a> is a plugin for serving binary content directly from Datasette on a special URL. I originally built it while working on <a href="https://github.com/dogsheep/dogsheep-photos">Dogsheep Photos</a> - given a SQLite file full of Apple Photos metadata I wanted to be able to serve thumbnails of the actual images via my Datasette web server.</p>

<p>Those photos were still stored on disk - the plugin lets you configure a SQL query like this which will cause hits to <code>/-/media/photos/$UUID</code> to serve that file from disk:</p>

 <code>{
    "plugins": {
        "datasette-media": {
            "photo": {
                "sql": "select filepath from apple_photos where uuid=:key"
            }
        }
    }
}</code> 

<p><a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-media/issues/14">Issue #14</a> added support for <code>BLOB</code> columns as well. You can now configure the plugin like this to serve binary content that was stored in the database:</p>

 <code>{
    "plugins": {
        "datasette-media": {
            "thumb": {
                "sql": "select content from thumbnails where uuid=:key"
            }
        }
    }
}</code> 

<p>This would serve content from a BLOB column in a <code>thumbnails</code> table from the URL <code>/-/media/thumb/$UUID</code>.</p>

<p>I really like this pattern of configuring plugins using SQL queries, where the returned column names have special meaning that is interpreted by the plugin. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-atom">datasette-atom</a> and <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-ics">datasette-ics</a> use a similar trick.</p>

<p>I expanded <code>datasette-media</code> with a few other related features:</p>

  Return a <code>content_url</code> column and it will proxy content from that URL  Set <code>"enable_transform": true</code> for a media bucket to enable <code>?w=</code> and <code>?h=</code> and <code>?format=</code> parameters for transforming the image before it is served to the user  Return a <code>content_filename</code> column to <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-media#setting-a-download-file-name">set a download file name</a> (in a <code>content-disposition</code> HTTP header) prompting the user's browser to download the file  

<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-media#readme">README</a> or <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-media/releases">release notes</a> for more details.</p>

 Also this week 

<p>I renamed <code>datasette-insert-api</code> to just <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-insert">datasette-insert</a>, reflecting my plans to add non-API features to that plugin in the future.</p>

<p>In doing so I had to figure out how to rename a PyPI package such that dependent projects would continue to work. I ended up building a <a href="https://github.com/simonw/pypi-rename">pypi-rename cookiecutter template</a> encoding what I learned.</p>

<p>I enabled PostgreSQL full-text search for my blog's Django Admin interface, and wrote <a href="https://github.com/simonw/til/blob/master/django/postgresql-full-text-search-admin.md">a TIL on how I did it</a>.</p>

<p>I <a href="https://github.com/simonw/db-to-sqlite/issues/26">added compound primary key support</a> to <code>db-to-sqlite</code>, so now it can convert PostgreSQL or MySQL databases to SQLite if they use compound primary keys.</p>

 TIL this week 

  <a href="https://github.com/simonw/til/blob/master/javascript/copy-button.md">Implementing a "copy to clipboard" button</a>  <a href="https://github.com/simonw/til/blob/master/django/postgresql-full-text-search-admin.md">PostgreSQL full-text search in the Django Admin</a>  <a href="https://github.com/simonw/til/blob/master/sqlite/blob-literals.md">SQLite BLOB literals</a>

 A DIF-hosted resource for community development  Introduction <p>It has been almost three years since DIF began working on the <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/a-universal-resolver-for-self-sovereign-identifiers-48e6b4a5cc3c">Universal Resolver</a> (GitHub: <a href="http://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver">Universal Resolver) </a>— a foundational piece of infrastructure for the Decentralized Identity ecosystem (see the <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/a-universal-resolver-for-self-sovereign-identifiers-48e6b4a5cc3c">original announcement</a>). Since then, our vision of being interoperable across ledgers and DID methods has seen a lot of support. Thanks to community contributions, the Universal Resolver now supports around 30 different DID&nbsp;methods.</p><p>Today, we are happy to announce an updated set of instances where the Universal Resolver is deployed. One stable and one experimental version will be iterated, maintained, and hosted by DIF as a service to the community!🎉</p><p>While this is undoubtedly a useful resource for research, experimentation, testing, and development, it is important that it not be mistaken for a production-grade universal resolver. It should be pointed out&nbsp;that:</p>  This infrastructure is neither intended or approved for production use cases and that nobody should rely on it for anything other than for development and testing purposes.  These two specific deployments are not production-ready. The preferred scenario continues to be that all DID-based information systems, run by a method operator or otherwise, production or otherwise, host their own instance of the Universal Resolver (or other DID Resolution tools).  DIF withholds the right to limit or modify the performance of this free service in case usage for production, commercial, and/or malicious purposes is detected.   Two Deployments <p>The following two deployments are now available as a community service:</p><p>* <a href="https://resolver.identity.foundation/">https://resolver.identity.foundation/</a> — Hosted on IBM Cloud by DIF (thanks IBM!). While not considered production-ready, this instance is expected to be relatively stable. It will be tested before and after manual updates from time to time, with versioned releases.<br>* <a href="https://dev.uniresolver.io/">https://dev.uniresolver.io/</a> — Hosted on AWS by DIF. This instance is more experimental, will be updated frequently, and is connected to CI/CD processes. It may be down from time to time or have unexpected functionality changes.</p><p>Note: For backward compatibility, the original URL <a href="https://uniresolver.io/">https://uniresolver.io/</a> will now redirect to <a href="https://dev.uniresolver.io/">https://dev.uniresolver.io/</a>.</p> Documentation <p>See the following links for more information about testing, release, and deployment processes of the Universal Resolver:</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@polarmermaid">Anne&nbsp;Nygård</a>  AWS Architecture: <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/dev-system.md">https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/dev-system.md</a>  CI/CD Process: <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/continuous-integration-and-delivery.md">https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/continuous-integration-and-delivery.md</a>  Branching Strategy: <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/branching-strategy.md">https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/branching-strategy.md</a>  Release process: <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/creating-releases.md">https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/creating-releases.md</a>  Periodically, this standing work item is discussed in the <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/identifiers-discovery.html">Identifiers and Discovery Working Group</a>, so that group’s recorded meetings and discussions on Slack and <a href="https://dif.groups.io/g/id-wg">mailing list</a> may contain further insight on the above&nbsp;topics.   <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/the-universal-resolver-infrastructure-395281d2b540">The Universal Resolver Infrastructure</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

   Some SQL Tricks of an Application DBA 
 This post taught me so many PostgreSQL tricks that I hadn't seen before. Did you know you can start a transaction, drop an index, run explain and then rollback the transaction (cancelling the index drop) to see what explain would look like without that index? Among other things I also learned what the "correlation" database statistic does: it's a measure of

Among other things I also learned what the "correlation" database statistic does: it's a measure of how close-to-sorted the values in a specific column are, which helps PostgreSQL decide if it should do an index scan or a bitmap scan when making use of an index.</p>

   sqlite-utils 2.12 
 I've been experimenting with ways of improving BLOB support in Datasette and sqlite-utils. This new version of sqlite-utils includes a "sqlite-utils insert-files" command, which can recursively crawl directories for files and add their contents to SQLite with configurable columns containing their metadata.

I was inspired by Paul Ford who has been creating multi-GB SQLite datab

<p>I've been experimenting with ways of improving BLOB support in Datasette and sqlite-utils. This new version of sqlite-utils includes a "sqlite-utils insert-files" command, which can recursively crawl directories for files and add their contents to SQLite with configurable columns containing their metadata.

I was inspired by Paul Ford who has been creating multi-GB SQLite databases of images and PDFs. It turns out that when disk space is cheap this is a pretty effective way of working with interesting corpuses of documents and images.</p>

    Organizations adopt microservices when the logistical overhead of coordinating teams against a monolith becomes so large that it starts affecting product velocity. Microservices are a way to release that organizational/logistical friction, at great technical cost.   — sagichmal

   pypi-rename 
 I wanted to rename a PyPI package (renaming datasette-insert-api to datasette-insert as it's about to grow some non-API features). PyPI recommend uploading a final release under the old name which points to (and depends on) the new name. I've built a cookiecutter template to codify that pattern.
