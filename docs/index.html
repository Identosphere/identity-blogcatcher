<p>The Overture Maps Foundation is a collaboration lead by Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and TomTom dedicated to producing "reliable, easy-to-use, and interoperable open map data".<br><br>Yesterday they put out their first release and it's pretty astonishing: four different layers of geodata, covering Places of Interest (shops, restaurants, attractions etc), administrative boundaries, building outlines and transportation networks.<br><br>The data is available as Parquet. I just downloaded the 8GB places dataset and can confirm that it contains 59 million listings from around the world - I filtered to just places in my local town and a spot check showed that recently opened businesses (last 12 months) were present and the details all looked accurate.<br><br>The places data is licensed under "Community Data License Agreement – Permissive" which looks like the only restriction is that you have to include that license when you further share the data.</p>

 A few days ago I shared around an idea for an ActivityPub API product. The response was enormous! Here's the link again.  If you're potentially interested in building on the fediverse using this tool, I'd love to know a little bit more. If you have 3 minutes, could you please give me some quick feedback?  If you’re a developer who is interested in building on the fediverse using this kind of API

 Isaiah Odhner built a full working clone of MS Paint that runs entirely in the terminal, using Textual and Python. It's worth trying this out to get a feel for quite how much you can get done with a CLI app these days - "pipx install textual-paint" worked for me.

<p>Website notifications are a blight. I never want a website to be able to notify me about updates; these messages are interruptive, and like the vast majority of app notifications, they tend to be part of some marketing team’s growth strategy rather than a conduit to actually useful information. (Product teams: if your notifications are there to drive traffic to a new feature or a promotion, you’re making the web worse. Stop it.)</p><p>Every browser allows you to prevent these notifications from showing up at all, but not all of them make it easy. For example, my primary browser is <a href="https://arc.net/">Arc</a>; I love it, but it doesn’t expose notification preferences in its Settings panel.</p><p>Luckily, every browser engine allows you to go straight to its full, advanced settings panel. Here’s how to do it:</p><p>In a Chromium-based browser (Chrome, Arc, Opera, Microsoft Edge):</p><p>Enter <code>about:settings</code> in the browser address bar.</p><p></p><p>Search for <code>notifications</code> and click on <code>site settings</code>.</p><p></p><p>Scroll down to <code>Notifications</code> and click through.</p><p></p><p>Then change the settings to the one you’d prefer.</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In Firefox:</p><p>Firefox does surface notifications in its settings panel.</p><p>Once you’re there, search for <code>notifications</code> and then hit the <code>settings</code> button next to the Notifications heading.</p><p></p><p>Then check the box that says <code>Block new requests asking to allow notifications</code>.</p><p></p><p>Et voila! No more annoying pop-up messages. Take that, marketing departments.</p>

I solved this by creating a dummy HTTP endpoint that simulates a hit to the OpenAI API, then configuring the Homebrew test to hit that instead.

<p></p><p>When I was fifteen, I ran a little “e-zine” called Spire that was distributed on the cover CDs of various real, paper magazines. I thought it was pretty cool, and that nobody could possibly have known that it was run by a fifteen-year-old. (In retrospect, it was pretty obvious.) I interviewed people like Nicholas Negroponte and Roger Ebert; I opined about tech in a very nineties, use-a-dollar-sign-to-spell-Micro$oft sort of way; I explored hypertext as a format.</p><p>Somewhere along the line, I got it into my head that the ninth issue would be the epitome of what I was trying to do. I decided to rebrand. I went for dark mode, putting everything on a black background with white and neon-highlight text. Instead of the colorful, friendly logo, I used a chrome rendering of the all-lowercase word “spire”. And I numbered each release like an event. Instead of issue 1, issue 2, etc., the new product would be called Spire One, Spire Two, and so on. And the first, coolest version of this would be Spire Nine.</p><p>I was fixated on this name and the whole vibe of what I was making. Spire Nine. I’d say it under my breath sometimes. Spire Nine. Even now, I get a funny feeling in my chest when I say it, probably because it’s just so cool. Spire Nine.</p><p>It’s a lame name.</p><p>I bet Elon Musk says “X” under his breath sometimes.</p><p>It’s a measure of how beloved Twitter was that so many people are emotionally invested in its rebranding to X. It was such a deep part of so many people’s lives — it was the backchannel to reality for a lot of people — that removing it feels like a wound. Or, at least, that’s one way to look at it. Let’s be real: it was a multi billion dollar public company, not a beloved community public square. It supported itself through advertising dollars made possible by optimizing for and monetizing our attention. If it hurts, it’s because we bought the product.</p><p>Long before it was sold, it was already tarnished goods: an imperfect place with timid management where women and people of color were regularly subjected to abuse, that was used by grifters of all political shades to exponentially grow their followings with a comparative lack of scrutiny. But it was also a place where genuinely positive movements like Black Lives Matter and MeToo could grow and thrive; where new writers and artists could find new audiences; where people from wildly different contexts and perspectives could meet.</p><p>Its sale solved a problem for its owners, who took Musk to court to complete the $44 billion transaction. It was already tanking. Not anywhere as fast as it has under his ownership, but the graphs were not going up and to the right.</p><p>And now the sale is long since done. Elon Musk, as Twitter’s sole proprietor and purchaser, is free to do as he wishes with it. Which, apparently, is to give it a name he thinks is cooler, repurpose its userbase to kickstart a completely different app modeled after China’s WeChat, give the hard right what appears to be free reign, and intentionally lose brand equity with the academics, activists, journalists, and artists who called it their home on the internet.</p><p>If you squint a bit, you could surmise that Musk decided he could use the sale to buy himself a few hundred million users with the app pre-installed on their phones in order to kickstart the thing he really wanted to build; his Spire Nine. (Spire Nine.) His original name for PayPal was X (Spire Nine) and he’s been sitting on the domain for years. This is a shortcut to getting to the equivalent of his teenage bedroom startup vision. That’s the kind of thing you can do if you’re a billionaire.</p><p>Of course, people have been leaving Twitter all over the place all year: nobody has to use Twitter, after all, and both Mastodon and Threads are providing a readily usable alternative for people who are sick of Musk’s apparently ego-driven changes.</p><p>It’s also possible that it’s a big tax write-off scheme, or that he’s high on his own supply (or just high) and is no longer capable of making rational business decisions, or that he’s trying to shake off his underwriters, or any number of other plausible and semi-plausible explanations. It’s hard to say for sure.</p><p>What we do know is that Twitter is gone, and each and every one of you reading this will be better off using a fediverse network like Mastodon or Threads instead. Or just posting to the web on your own website and reading other peoples’ updates using RSS. Or going outside and touching grass.</p><p>I’ve given Musk plenty of oxygen online, and I think I have to stop. The previous Twitter product was hyper-corporate and already broken and harmful. The new one is essentially irrelevant to my life. There are a lot of really good new things being made, and a lot of people doing great things, and a lot of good planning is happening in my own work, and I think it’s more productive to move forward than bog myself down in nostalgia for the past, let alone preoccupy myself with some billionaire’s teen-level ego trip.</p><p>So I’ll say it again: <a href="https://werd.social/@ben">join me on the fediverse</a>. <a href="https://werd.io">Follow my updates on my own site</a>. <a href="https://newsletter.werd.io">Subscribe to the newsletter</a>. Start your own one of each of these things because I want to read them. And let’s forget about that other place.</p><p>(Spire Nine.)</p>

I was previously running my own separate tap, but having it in core means that it benefits from Homebrew's impressive set of build systems - each release of LLM now has Bottles created for it automatically across a range of platforms, so "brew install llm" should quickly download binary assets rather than spending several minutes installing dependencies the slow way.</p>

<p><code>sqlite-utils</code> is my combination Python library and command-line tool for manipulating SQLite databases. It recently celebrated its fifth birthday, and has had over 100 releases since it first launched back in 2018.</p>
<p>The new plugin system is inspired by similar mechanisms <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/plugins.html">in Datasette</a> and <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/plugins/index.html">LLM</a>. It lets developers add new features to <code>sqlite-utils</code> without needing to get their changes accepted by the core project.</p>
<p>I love plugin systems. As an open source maintainer they are by far the best way to encourage people to contribute to my projects - I can genuinely wake up in the morning and my software has new features, and I didn't even need to review a pull request.</p>
<p>Plugins also offer a fantastic medium for exploration and experimentation. I can try out new ideas without committing to supporting them in core, and without needing to tie improvements to them to the core release cycle.</p>
<p>Version 3.34 adds <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/plugins.html#plugin-hooks">two initial plugin hooks</a>: <code>register_commands()</code> and <code>prepare_connection()</code>. These are both based on the equivalent hooks in Datasette.</p>
<p>I planned to just ship <code>register_commands()</code>, but Alex Garcia spotted my activity on the repo and submitted <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils/pull/573">a PR</a> adding <code>prepare_connection()</code> literally minutes before I had intended to ship the release!</p>
 register_commands() 
<p>The <code>register_commands()</code> hook lets you add new commands to the <code>sqlite-utils</code> command-line tool - so users can run <code>sqlite-utils your-new-command</code> to access your feature.</p>
<p>I've learned from past experience that you should never ship a plugin hook without also releasing at least one plugin that uses it. I've built two so far for <code>register_commands()</code>:</p>
 
 
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils-shell">sqlite-utils-shell</a> adds a simply interactive shell, accessed using <code>sqlite-utils shell</code> for an in-memory database or <code>sqlite-utils shell data.db</code> to run it against a specific database file. 
 
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-migrate">sqlite-migrate</a> is my first draft of a database migrations system for SQLite, loosely inspired by Django migrations and previewed by the migration mechanism I <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/blob/0.6.1/llm/migrations.py">added to LLM</a>. 
 
<p>Try out the shell plugin like this:</p>
  sqlite-utils install sqlite-utils-shell
sqlite-utils shell  
<p>The interface looks like this:</p>
 <code>In-memory database, content will be lost on exit
Type 'exit' to exit.
sqlite-utils&gt; select 3 + 5;
  3 + 5
-------
      8
sqlite-utils&gt;
</code> 
 prepare_connection() 
<p>This hook, contributed by Alex, lets you modify the connection object before it is used to execute any SQL. Most importantly, this lets you register custom SQLite functions.</p>
<p>I expect this to be the most common category of plugin. I've built one so far: <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils-dateutil">sqlite-utils-dateutil</a>, which adds functions for parsing dates and times using the <a href="https://dateutil.readthedocs.io/">dateutil</a> library.</p>
<p>It lets you do things like this:</p>
  sqlite-utils install sqlite-utils-dateutil
sqlite-utils memory "select dateutil_parse('3rd october')" -t  
<p>Output:</p>
 <code>dateutil_parse('3rd october')
-------------------------------
2023-10-03T00:00:00
</code> 
<p>This works inside <code>sqlite-shell</code> too.</p>
<p>Plugins that you install also become available in the Python API interface to <code>sqlite-utils</code>:</p>
  &gt;&gt;&gt; import sqlite_utils
&gt;&gt;&gt; db = sqlite_utils.Database(memory=True)
&gt;&gt;&gt; list(db.query("select dateutil_parse('3rd october')"))
[{"dateutil_parse('3rd october')": '2023-10-03T00:00:00'}]  
<p>You can opt out of executing installed plugins by passing <code>execute_plugins=False</code> to the <code>Database()</code> constructor:</p>
  &gt;&gt;&gt; db = sqlite_utils.Database(memory=True, execute_plugins=False)
&gt;&gt;&gt; list(db.query("select dateutil_parse('3rd october')"))
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
  File ".../site-packages/sqlite_utils/db.py", line 494, in query
    cursor = self.execute(sql, params or tuple())
  File ".../site-packages/sqlite_utils/db.py", line 512, in execute
    return self.conn.execute(sql, parameters)

 sqlite-ml by Romain Clement 
<p>I quietly released <code>sqlite-utils 3.34</code> on Saturday. The community has already released several plugins for it!</p>
<p>Romain Clement built <a href="https://github.com/rclement/sqlite-utils-ml">sqlite-utils-ml</a>, a plugin wrapper for his <a href="https://github.com/rclement/sqlite-ml">sqlite-ml</a> project.</p>
<p>This adds custom SQL functions for training machine learning models and running predictions, entirely within SQLite, using algorithms from <a href="https://scikit-learn.org">scikit-learn</a>.</p>
<p>Here's what that looks like running inside <code>sqlite-utils shell</code>:</p>
  sqlite-utils install sqlite-utils-shell sqlite-utils-ml

 SQLite extensions by Alex Garcia 
<p>Alex Garcia has <a href="https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-ecosystem">a growing collection</a> of SQLite extensions, many of which are written in Rust but are packaged as wheels for ease of installation using Python.</p>
<p>Alex released five plugins for SQLite corresponding to five of his existing extensions:</p>
 
 <code>sqlite-utils-sqlite-regex</code> 
 <code>sqlite-utils-sqlite-path</code> 
 <code>sqlite-utils-sqlite-url</code> 
 <code>sqlite-utils-sqlite-ulid</code> 
 <code>sqlite-utils-sqlite-lines</code> 
 
<p>Here's an example of <code>sqlite-utils-sqlite-ulid</code> in action:</p>
  sqlite-utils install sqlite-utils-sqlite-ulid
sqlite-utils memory 'select ulid() u1, ulid() u2, ulid() u3' | jq  
<p>Output:</p>
  [
  {
    "u1": "01h64d1ysg1rx63z1gwy7nah4n",
    "u2": "01h64d1ysgd7vx04sc9pncqh10",
    "u3": "01h64d1ysgz1sy7njkqt86dkq9"
  }
]  
<p>I've started a <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils-plugins">sqlite-utils plugin directory</a> with a list of all of the plugins so far.</p>
 Building your own plugin 
<p>If you want to try building your own plugin, the documentation includes a <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/plugins.html#building-a-plugin">simple step-by-step guide</a>. A plugin can be built with as little as two files: a Python module implementing the hooks, and a <code>pyproject.toml</code> module with metadata about how it should be installed.</p>
<p>I've also released a new <a href="https://pypi.org/project/cookiecutter/">cookiecutter</a> template: <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils-plugin">simonw/sqlite-utils-plugin</a>. Here's how to use that to get started building a plugin:</p>
  cookiecutter gh:simonw/sqlite-utils-plugin  
<p>Answer the form fields like this:</p>
 <code>plugin_name []: rot13
description []: select rot13('text') as a sqlite-utils plugin
hyphenated [rot13]: 
underscored [rot13]: 
github_username []: your-username
author_name []: your-name
</code> 
<p>Change directory into the new folder and use <code>sqlite-utils install -e</code> to install an editable version of your plugin, so changes you make will be reflected when you run the tool:</p>
  cd sqlite-utils-rot13
sqlite-utils install -e .  
<p>Run this command to confirm the plugin has been installed:</p>
  sqlite-utils plugins  
<p>You should see this:</p>
  [
  {
    "name": "sqlite-utils-rot13",
    "hooks": [
      "prepare_connection"
    ],
    "version": "0.1"
  }
]  
<p>Now drop this code into the <code>sqlite_utils_rot13.py</code> file:</p>
 import sqlite_utils


def rot13(s):
    chars = []
    for v in s:
        c = ord(v)
        if c &gt;= ord("a") and c &lt;= ord("z"):
            if c &gt; ord("m"):
                c -= 13
            else:
                c += 13
        elif c &gt;= ord("A") and c &lt;= ord("Z"):
            if c &gt; ord("M"):
                c -= 13
            else:
                c += 13
        chars.append(chr(c))

    return "".join(chars)


@sqlite_utils.hookimpl
def prepare_connection(conn):
    conn.create_function("rot13", 1, rot13) 
<p>And try it out like this:</p>
  sqlite-utils memory "select rot13('hello world')"  
<p>Output:</p>
  [{"rot13('hello world')": "uryyb jbeyq"}]  
<p>And to reverse that:</p>
 <code>sqlite-utils memory "select rot13('uryyb jbeyq')"
</code> 
<p>Output:</p>
  [{"rot13('uryyb jbeyq')": "hello world"}]  
<p>As you can see, building plugins can be done with very little code. I'm excited to see what else people build with this new capability!</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>My RSI (repetitive strain injury) struggles began 25 years ago, after an intensive push to build and ship the BYTE magazine website. The tendons in both wrists became badly inflamed, and I spent a couple of months in rehab: anti-inflammatory meds, alternating heat and ice, stretching. It mostly resolved, but my left thumb joint remained painful. One day, as I wondered what could possibly be the cause, I looked down at my hands as I was typing. I use the world’s <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2009/03/14/the-floating-arms-keyboard/">best</a> (and rarest) split keyboard so there’s a left spacebar and a right spacebar. Suddenly it was obvious. I was always hitting the left spacebar with my left thumb, an unconscious habit that was repeated hundreds or thousands of times a day. And I was really slamming it too, another habit that I still have to monitor. Thus began one of a series of interventions to remap the relationship between fingers and keys. In that case, I assigned my right thumb to the spacebar, intending to switch to an alternating pattern once things settled down. All these years later, I look down at my hands now and see that never happened. I’m still using the right spacebar exclusively. I should probably try to change that, but there’s a more pressing problem.</p>
<p>Over the years, I got bitten a few more times by the effects of asymmetry. When my left hand became painful again, I realized I was mousing exclusively with that hand, and switched the mouse to my right side. I think I’ve gone back and forth a few times, currently it’s again on the right.</p>
<p>Another time, when I was doing a lot of lap swimming, my right shoulder became painful. Once again, it was something that should have been obvious, but wasn’t to the medical people I consulted, and wasn’t to me either until, once again, I recognized another asymmetry: I was always breathing on the left side, which put extra strain on the right shoulder. When I switched to an alternating pattern, breathing every third stroke instead of every second, that problem resolved.</p>
<p>You’d think I’d have learned my lesson by now. But when the knuckle of my left pinky suddenly became inflamed two months ago, it was the same story all over again. I attributed it to playing more guitar than usual, but when laying off didn’t help I thought I might have triggered arthritis. An x-ray was negative, though. What could it possibly be?</p>
<p>Then last night, while typing, I felt a twinge and looked down at my hands. It was blindingly obvious: I use emacs key mappings; the CTRL key is part of many of the basic chords; my poor left pinky is overloaded. Amping up the guitar playing probably pushed me over the edge, but it seems clear that is the root cause.</p>
<p>So I’m typing this post in order to adjust to yet another remapping. On this keyboard, there’s also a right CTRL key but it’s not convenient to my right pinky, so I’ve recruited the right SHIFT key (which I apparently never use) to be my new CTRL key. It’s not going to be an easy adjustment, but I won’t complain, I’m just glad to know I’ve found the way forward.</p>
<p>Given these experiences, I’ve thought a lot about how we can unconsciously injure ourselves with repetitive and asymmetric patterns of movement. In my case, I don’t seem to receive any signals until damage is already done. I wish I could notice sooner, do the necessary remapping, and continue with less disruption. But it just doesn’t seem to work that way. </p>
<p>I really can’t complain, though. Recently I met a guy in a guitar shop whose left wrist and hand became so painful that he had to switch sides and learn to fret with his right hand. It’s hard for me to conceive of doing that kind of remapping, but you do what you have to do. And as a bonus, he’s now a switch-hitter: as he recovers some use of his left hand, he finds that he can achieve different effects as a right-handed and left-handed player.</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure I’ll get through this episode. The question will then become: how to avoid the next one? When we use computer keyboards or musical instruments, we need our hands to work unconsciously and automatically. It’s only when injuries happen that we have to surface what’s been unconscious, enter manual mode, and retrain until we can form new unconscious habits. I wish there were an early warning system.</p>

 A Eulogy for a&nbsp;Game <p>Family, friends, and fellow CT&nbsp;members,</p><p>Today, we bid a heartfelt farewell to a beloved game that won our hearts in 2018, TCR Party. This game managed to carve a niche, transforming how we looked at token-curated registries, incentive models, and abstracted on-chain interactions.</p><p>TCR Party was not just an ordinary game but a masterpiece of community spirit. As we remember and celebrate its existence — a noble quest to curate a list of the 100 most influential Crypto Twitter accounts — it wasn’t just about gaining followers or amassing likes, but about the friends we made along the way. Hell, we even got a CoinDesk article out of it (thanks,&nbsp;Leigh).</p><p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2019/02/08/tcr-party-the-cryptotwitter-popularity-contest-everyones-talking-about/">TCR Party: The #CryptoTwitter Popularity Contest Everyone's Talking About</a></p><p>TCR Party was not just about the numbers; it was about the people. Yet, as with all good things, the time has come to say goodbye to TCR Party. But let us not be saddened by its departure. Instead, let us cherish the memories of the camaraderie we shared, the knowledge we gained, and the impact it&nbsp;had.</p><p>Rest in peace, TCR Party. Your mark on the space shall never be forgotten.</p><p>Let me offer a brief introduction for those who don't know what any of this&nbsp;means.</p> Token Curated Registries (TCRs) <p>For those who are entirely new here, the first thing that should be explained are Token Curated Registries (TCRs).</p><p>TCRs were initially proposed by Mike Goldin as a way to have a decentralized set of actors essentially curate a list. This could be any form of information — be it something subjective such as a grocery list, a list of “noteworthy projects,” or even a more enforceable registry such as an allowlist or blocklist for a&nbsp;forum.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@ilovebagels/token-curated-registries-1-0-61a232f8dac7">Token-Curated Registries 1.0</a></p><p>Actions in this system involve nominating, voting, and challenging existing registry items, all controlled through token voting. The incentives and involved parties are structured as the following:</p>  Self-interested curators (token holders) create a valuable list to increase the value of their voting&nbsp;power.  Candidates that wish to be curated into “important” lists would effectively buy or petition their way onto the registry.  Consumers desire a trustworthy north star for curated information.  <p>There are also additional incentive systems that keep people from making bad decisions, such as a failed nomination slashing the bond put in place to make that nomination in the first place. In this case, token holders are incentivized to keep the information on the list as noteworthy and “valuable” as possible to keep the system running and their holdings worth something.</p><p>But what makes information “valuable?” Does it actually have to be truthful?</p> The Half-Truth in&nbsp;TCRs <p>Although TCRs set out to curate objective information for the sake of the value of the list, this is often marred by personal opinions, bribery, conspiracy, and plain old trolling. For a TCR to produce an objective list, you would need highly motivated specialists doing the curation&nbsp;that:</p>  Care enough about the issue and have a wide enough audience to broadcast to,  Are willing to put financial assets on the line in these&nbsp;cases,  And are willing to morally be above bribery in the case of short-term payouts at the expense of more significant long-term gains.  <p>I still think (considering the maturity of the technology and the general interest of folks) that TCRs aren’t an excellent idea for curating meaningful, objective truth. This is why projects like <a href="http://www.coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/02/media-startup-civil-shuts-down-team-absorbed-into-decentralized-id-efforts-at-consensys/">Civil</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/trustory-app/why-trustory-is-shutting-down-6d50175628eb">TruStory</a> were both dead on&nbsp;arrival.</p><p>In a wackier case, there was once even a proposal to name members voted onto a TCR as an oracle of an event’s outcome for a decentralized predictions market (in this case, not having a central reporting mechanism). However, due to a few more reasons around the scale of the event being reported on and plain old apathy, I wrote about this entire case a few years&nbsp;ago:</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/alpineintel/on-tcrs-and-predictions-markets-counterweights-and-collusion-408d03ab7090">On TCRs and Predictions Markets: Counterweights and Collusion</a></p><p>In short, I don’t believe TCRs can be helpful mechanisms for curating objective information. However, I believe they can play a part in making useful hyper-subjective lists, typically in art curation or even popularity contests. Subjectivity and opinions would make them practical for popularity contests because of how motivated people are in the case of low-stakes games for personal satisfaction. This is what sparked the idea for TCR&nbsp;Party.</p> TCR Party <p>I originally invented TCR Party while on the Alpine team at ConsenSys, led by <a href="https://twitter.com/wycdd">Wayne Chang</a>. I wanted to experiment with subjectivity and curation based on the above&nbsp;thesis.</p><p>My first thought was: “What’s the most contentious, opinionated, and drama-filled place on the internet with a relevant audience?” The answer was Twitter. In this case, we would use the entirety of Crypto Twitter to curate a list of the top 100 Crypto Twitter accounts to follow. We would also call it “TCR Party” to give it an air of exclusivity — or a party you wished to be invited&nbsp;to.</p><p>TCR Party had to be abstracted, encourage subjective opinions, and fuel a popularity contest. One of the first things we did was abstract away any need to interface with wallets or a public blockchain directly by instead using Twitter as the primary user interface.</p><p>Twitter was typically where all crypto discourse was happening, and users were quite familiar with existing design patterns on the site. Therefore, we used bots to be both the relay for the curated list, and to handle all the interactions that involved public blockchains. I still wonder if it could be considered the first experiment in account abstraction because it used Twitter accounts to control wallets and handle transactions on your&nbsp;behalf.</p> How it&nbsp;Looked <p>The first step in the process was interfacing with the @<a href="https://twitter.com/TCRPartyVIP">TCRPartyVIP</a> bot, which handled account generation and all on-chain actions on behalf of the user. This was initiated by Tweeting “Hey @TCRPartyVIP let’s party,” which would start the conversation with the bot. We figured this would initiate a fun viral feedback loop, where those who weren’t sure what was going on would Tweet the same message to join in on what was happening.</p><p>After that, the bot would set up your account, and you can then start nominating, challenging, or voting using simple DMs to the bot, such as “nominate @example” which would then initiate the&nbsp;action.</p><p>This bot was also responsible for continually posting updates about the on-chain activity. Any time there was a nomination, removal, or vote, the bot would Tweet the outcome or event as it happened.</p><p>We ultimately made the game’s asset inflationary to encourage continued participation (because voting with more strength required hitting the faucet daily). The bot would distribute 100 tokens daily if you told it “faucet.” We went with the Rinkeby testnet at the time because it was simple to use and easy to minimize all the on-chain transaction costs. In this case, the user could always continue to play the game without worrying about funding the generated wallet. We did consider a world where the game was on mainnet, and users could essentially “eject” from the system and control their own assets — but we felt it wasn’t necessary at the time to carry out the experiment.</p><p>Finally, the game was centered on popularity for a reason — it kept people coming back, and gave them the chance to be curated on a list alongside other popular accounts. For four years, <a href="https://twitter.com/TCRPartyBot">@TCRPartyBot</a> was responsible for amplifying each list member by retweeting any of their tweets. In this case, TCRPartyVIP could continue to post about challenges, nominations, and votes, while TCRPartyBot could be just the curation&nbsp;output.</p><p>The game ended up curating quite a decent list of characters over time, and even as the interest in TCR Party dried up, and we paused development on it, TCRPartyBot kept retweeting that&nbsp;list.</p> Not Dead Just&nbsp;Yet <p>The most important part of TCR Party’s development was making the <a href="https://gitlab.com/alpinefresh/tcr-party/contracts">contracts</a>, <a href="https://gitlab.com/alpinefresh/tcr-party/leaderboard">leaderboard</a>, <a href="https://gitlab.com/alpinefresh/tcr-party/tcrpartybot">Twitter bot</a>, and even the <a href="https://gitlab.com/alpinefresh/tcr-party/www.tcr.party">website</a> open source, so anyone can take TCR Party and make their own&nbsp;game.</p><p>All that would need to happen is a relaunch of all the components and someone to subsidize the testnet assets required to keep the machine running (or mainnet if someone is so generous). A new system launch would likely be smoother, considering how easy it is to spin up a new blockchain with enough speed and low enough cost to keep it&nbsp;simple.</p><p>I encourage anyone interested to pick it up and keep the party going. Who knows — maybe I’ll relaunch&nbsp;it.</p><p>Party on.</p>

   The Wall Street Journal
reports
that: 
 
 User engagement on Threads has continued to fall after an initial surge in sign-ups …
the number of daily active users [has fallen] to 13 million, down about 70% from a
July 7 peak, according to estimates from market intelligence firm Sensor Tower.

  <p>The Wall Street Journal
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/threads-user-engagement-continues-to-drop-adding-urgency-for-new-features-8ed2f384">reports</a>
that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>User engagement on Threads has continued to fall after an initial surge in sign-ups …
the number of daily active users [has fallen] to 13 million, down about 70% from a
July 7 peak, according to estimates from market intelligence firm Sensor Tower.
The average time users spend on the iOS and Android apps has also decreased to four minutes
from 19 minutes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s quite a bit different than the headlines of “fastest app growth in history”
and “more than 100 million accounts in a week”. It was always clear that only a fraction
of those initial users were going to stick around, but more concerning – from Meta’s point of
view – is that decrease in time spent with the app by the users that do continue to
use the app: from 19 minutes to four minutes is a very significant decline.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the (open) Fediverse, however, I think this is very good news:</p>
 
 At these numbers, Threads is still significantly larger than the rest of the Fediverse
combined, but far less so than it looked like a week ago. There was a possibility that
Meta would simply drop their plans to implement ActivityPub, or just do a very rudimentary
job, because why would you spend much attention on this if all you can connect to is
a network 1% the size of your own. At 10-20%, as it looks like right now, that
argument is very different. 
 Rather than leaning back, and celebrating its success, Meta now needs to work hard
to compete with Twitter. (And Twitter will have to compete back.) That is good for
the world in general, and indirectly good for the Fediverse as the “market” for text-based
microblogs is suddenly competitive again. People realize they have at least two
(well-marketed) choices; it’s not a foregone conclusion that “Twitter owns this”.
If there are two choices, maybe there are three of four, including the non-Meta Fediverse. 
 And perhaps, as a side effect of all of this, some of the dollars being spent may find
their way into the Fediverse. Certainly Meta is now even more incentivized to highlight
Threads’ differences with Twitter, and key to that is ActivityPub. I would think that
should make them more willing, rather than less, to spend a bit of money on Fediverse
infrastructure, like a test suite, that benefits the entire network. 
 Of course, it’s also good news for everybody who had been concerned that Threads would
overwhelm the culture of the Fediverse the same way AOL overwhelmed in the culture
of Usenet in the nineties. 
 
<p>(Note: I am in favor of Meta implementing ActivityPub in Threads; in fact I would like it to
implement it in all of its social media properties, and messenger services like WhatsApp
– or perhaps a similar protocol like Matrix. I believe the same for non-Meta apps like
LinkedIn, YouTube etc.</p>
<p>IMHO, the ability to interoperate across platforms is a major disinfectant, and can be a
major factor in reducing product lock-in, which can lead to better products, more
choices, and fewer “forced” policies like privacy invasions, because users have the
ability to go elsewhere. I understand those Fediverse users who do not want to
touch anything that Meta does and sympathize; the good news is that you, as a user,
have unprecedented control in the Fediverse over who you do and do not want to interact
with, and more power to you if you exercise that control.)</p>

In the 20th episode of my Mastodon series I pivoted to a new topic: LLM-assisted coding. After three posts in the new series, it got picked up by <a href="https://thenewstack.io">The New Stack</a>. Here’s the full list so far, I’ll update it here as the series continues there.</p>

<p>
Although I’ve spent decades working with software, and still regularly write code in one form or another, I’m only an average programmer. There’s no doubt that LLM assistants can help me be better. But how much better? In what ways exactly? That’s what I aim to find out. My day job embeds me in a fast-moving open-source project, <a href="https://steampipe.io">Steampipe</a>, to which I want to contribute as much as I can. That ambition was, until recently, tempered by my own limitations. Now, augmented by the collective knowledge embodied in LLM assistants, I’m raising my sights. Larry Wall famously said: “Easy things should be easy, and hard things should be possible.” It’s starting to look like even hard things can be easy. But the devil’s in the details, so in this series I’ll focus on concrete examples of how LLM assistants do (and don’t) help me become a better developer.</p>

  <p>The big news today is <a href="https://ai.meta.com/llama/">Llama 2</a>, the new openly licensed Large Language Model from Meta AI. It's a really big deal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Llama 2 is available for free for research and commercial use.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(swyy <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1681364325469143040">spotted</a> that it was rebranded from LLaMA 2 to Llama 2 <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama/commit/6d4c0c290aeec1fa4399694fefb864be5a153bb6">a few hours ago</a>.)</p>
<p>Facebook's original LLaMA model, released in February, kicked off a seismic wave of innovation in the world of open source LLMs - from fine-tuned variants to from-scratch recreations. I wrote about the impact this was having a few weeks after its original release in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Mar/11/llama/">Large language models are having their Stable Diffusion moment</a>. If anything I under-estimated how significant this was going to be.</p>
<p>There was just one catch: you couldn't use it for commercial purposes.</p>
<p>That's changed with Llama 2!</p>
<p>It does still have <a href="https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/">a couple of interesting limitations</a>, emphasis mine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You will not use the Llama Materials or any output or results of the Llama Materials to improve any other large language model (excluding Llama 2 or derivative works thereof).</p>
<p>If, on the Llama 2 version release date, the monthly active users of the products or services made available by or for Licensee, or Licensee’s affiliates, is greater than 700 million monthly active users in the preceding calendar month, you must request a license from Meta, which Meta may grant to you in its sole discretion[...]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This still makes it available for most commercial purposes. Let's try it out.</p>
 Accessing Llama 2 using LLM 
<p>My <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a> tool provides command-line access to a wide variety of language models, both via web APIs and self-hosted on your own machine.</p>
<p>Last week <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Jul/12/llm/">I added plugin support</a> for extending it to support new models. An independently released plugin can now add support for new models to the existing CLI tool.</p>
<p>The brand new <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-replicate">llm-replicate</a> plugin provides CLI access to models hosted on <a href="https://replicate.com/">Replicate</a>, and this morning a16z-infra released <a href="https://replicate.com/a16z-infra/llama13b-v2-chat">a16z-infra/llama13b-v2-chat</a> which provides Replicate API access to the new Llama 2 13B chat model.</p>
<p>You'll need a <a href="https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens">Replicate API key</a>.</p>
<p>Install LLM like this:</p>
  pip install llm  
<p>(I like to use <a href="https://pypa.github.io/pipx/">pipx</a>.)</p>
<p>Or if you don't have <code>pip</code> setup but can use <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>:</p>
  brew install simonw/llm/llm  
<p>Run <code>llm --version</code> to confirm it's installed.</p>
<p>Next, install the <code>llm-replicate</code> plugin:</p>
  llm install llm-replicate  
<p>The plugin adds a new <code>llm replicate</code> set of commands - see them with <code>llm --help</code>.</p>
<p>Configure your Replicate API key so the plugin can talk to the API:</p>
  llm keys set replicate  
 <code>Enter key: &lt;paste key here&gt;
</code> 
<p>Register the new <code>a16z-infra/llama13b-v2-chat</code> model with the plugin:</p>
  llm replicate add a16z-infra/llama13b-v2-chat \
  --chat --alias llama2  
<p>This tells the plugin that it's a "chat" model, which means you can have continuing conversations with it, rather than just sending single prompts.</p>
<p>Now we can send a prompt, using the <code>llama2</code> alias we configured there:</p>
 <code>llm -m llama2 "Ten great names for a pet pelican"
</code> 
<p>I get this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Certainly! Here are ten great names for a pet pelican:</p>
 
 Peanut: A cute and playful name for a small pelican. 
 Puddles: A fun and silly name for a pelican that loves to splash around in water. 
 Pete: A classic name that suits a friendly and outgoing pelican. 
 Penelope: A pretty and elegant name for a female pelican. 
 Percy: A charming and sophisticated name for a male pelican. 
 Pippy: A playful and affectionate name for a pelican with a lively personality. 
 Pelty: A fun and quirky name for a pelican with a unique sense of style. 
 Pip: A sweet and endearing name for a small pelican. 
 Plucky: A feisty and adventurous name for a pelican with a big personality. 
 Poppy: A lovely and delicate name for a female pelican with a sweet disposition. 
 
<p>I hope these suggestions help you find the perfect name for your pet pelican!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And because it's a chat model, we can send a follow-up prompt to the <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/usage.html#continuing-a-conversation">same conversation</a>:</p>
  llm -c "Five more and make them more nautical"  
<blockquote>
<p>Ahoy! Here be five more nautical names for yer pet pelican:</p>
 
 Seabird: A fitting name for a pelican that loves the ocean and all its wonders. 
 Captain Hook: A swashbuckling name for a pelican with a bold and fearless spirit. 
 Anchor: A sturdy and dependable name for a pelican that's always grounded and stable. 
 Finley: A fishy name for a pelican with a love for the sea and all its creatures. 
 Buoyant: A bouncy and cheerful name for a pelican with a lighthearted and carefree attitude. 
 
<p>Hope these suggestions float yer boat, matey!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>LLM logs every prompt and response sent through it to a SQLite database. I'm using <code>--truncate</code> here to shorten the output to include in this post:</p>

 What's next 
<p>I'm really excited about Llama 2. I expect we'll start seeing all kinds of innovation on top of it as the model weights themselves start to roll out.</p>
<p>I'm particularly looking forward to:</p>
 
 The fine-tuned models. Alpaca, Vicuna et-al did amazing things with fine-tuning on top of the original LLaMA. I expect we'll see dozens of fine-tuned models over the next few weeks. 
 Implementation of the <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/llms/python-react-pattern">reAct</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04761">Toolformer</a> patterns, which will enable Llama 2 to drive external tools in a similar way to <a href="https://openai.com/blog/function-calling-and-other-api-updates">OpenAI Functions</a>. The <a href="https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/llama-2-open-foundation-and-fine-tuned-chat-models/">Llama 2 paper</a> mentions testing against Toolformer prompts already, so this hopefully won't be too difficult. 
 
<p>Hopefully this time we'll start to see a concerted effort from people to document what kind of prompts work well with Llama 2 for practical purposes, since I expect this model will be an influential piece of the ecosystem for some time to come.</p>

<p>Dealing with privacy issues isn’t as simple as the tech (and all too often the security) industry thinks. There are some real challenges and ethical conundrums to deal with, and we ignore the reality of the society into which our products are going at our own peril. We are seeing this happen full force right now with AI. In their fear of being left behind, all too many companies are throwing AI into the mix with the old “build ship fast and break things” mentality. Especially surprising in the identity industry given that we have seen how much of a negative impact that can have.</p>



<p>Doing all we can to preventing tragedies like the one below requires multiple changes in how we build products. I can’t claim to know all the answers. But I do know it starts with putting together diverse teams (which means bringing those who live these threats into the design process). Incorporating abusability testing is key, and there is a clear need for applied ethics.</p>

<p></p>
<p>So I thought I’d give <a href="http://bing.com">Bing</a> a try at <a href="https://zapier.com/blog/chatgpt-vs-bing-chat/">using ChatGPT</a> to answer a question for which I knew the answer.</p>
<p>The question was, “What group sings the theme song to the podcast ‘A History of Rock Music in 500 Songs’?”</p>
<p>Bing search took me to a page of search results about the podcast itself, which didn’t help; but I saw a chat menu under its search bar. Clicking on that brought up a huge popover headlined, “Chat mode is only available when you have access to the new Bing.” For that I need to “unlock conversational search on Microsoft Edge.”</p>
<p>Which I already had, but had hardly used.&nbsp; So I went to Bing on Edge and clicked on the Chat link. Next, it wanted me to log into Microsoft itself. This required two-factor authentication for my password manager (Dashlane) and for Microsoft. Annoying, but we live in an annoying time.</p>
<p>Still, I got to engage Bing Chat, asking it the same question. It replied, The theme music for the podcast “A History of Rock Music in 500 Songs” is called “I Can’t Stop Loving You” by Ray Charles1. I hope that helps!</p>
<p>It didn’t help. In fact, it could hardly be farther off.</p>
<p>So I said, “No, it’s a female group, and the song was recorded in the 1930s.” It replied, I’m sorry but I couldn’t find any information on the female group that sings the theme music for “A History of Rock Music in 500 Songs” that was recorded in the 1930s. Would you like me to help you with anything else?</p>
<p>Nope. So then I tried ChatGPT, and got this answer:</p>
<p>The theme song for the podcast “A History of Rock Music in 500 Songs” is performed by a group called “The Men That Will Not Be Blamed for Nothing.” The band is known for their unique blend of punk rock and Victorian music hall influences, and they have a dedicated following within the alternative music scene. Their song “Margate Fhtagn,” which is used as the theme song for the podcast, captures the spirit of the show’s exploration of rock music history.</p>
<p>Wholly shit. Talk about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination_(artificial_intelligence)">hallucinating</a>.</p>
<p>Then I went to <a href="https://perplexity.ai">perplexity.ai</a>, which gave a correct answer, complete with sources:&nbsp;The theme song for the podcast “A History of Rock Music in 500 Songs” is called “Rock and Roll” [1]. It is a song from 1934 and is believed to be the very first song to use the phrase “rock and roll” in those words.</p>
<p>The “1” is a footnote going to <a href="https://500songs.com/podcast/bonus-question-and-answer-episode-1/">the source of the answer</a>. which is a post for the “500 Songs” podcast itself. Again, the song is called “Rock and Roll,” and it’s by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boswell_Sisters">Boswell Sisters</a>.</p>
<p>In that post,&nbsp;<a href="https://andrewhickey.info/">Andrew Hickey</a>, the amazing host and producer of ‘500 Songs’, writes,</p>
<blockquote><p>The song is called “Rock and Roll”, and it’s from 1934. It is, I believe, the very first song to use the phrase “rock and roll” in those words — there was an earlier song called “rocking and rolling”, but I think it’s the first one to use the phrase “rock and roll”.</p>
<p>It’s performed by the Boswell Sisters, a jazz vocal trio from the thirties whose lead singer, Connee Boswell, influenced Ella Fitzgerald among others, and it was written by Richard Whiting and Sidney Clare.</p>
<p>They actually wrote it for Shirley Temple — they’re the people who wrote “On the Good Ship Lollipop” — but it was turned down for use in one of her films so the Boswells did it instead.</p>
<p>The version I’m using is actually the version the Boswells sang in a film, Transatlantic Merry-Go-Round, rather than the proper studio recording. That’s just because the film version was easier for me to obtain.</p></blockquote>
<p>So there you have it.</p>
<p>I don’t know who does perplexity.ai, but it is by far the most useful AI chatbot I’ve found so far. (Though I’ve been briefed on another one in the works. Stay tuned for that.)</p>
<p>[Later…] I just asked Bard the same question, and got this answer:</p>
<p>The theme song to the podcast “A History of Rock Music in 500 Songs” is “Rock and Roll” by the Boswell Sisters. The song was released in 1934 and is considered to be the first song to use the phrase “rock and roll” in its lyrics. The Boswell Sisters were a jazz vocal trio from the 1930s who were known for their harmonies and their innovative arrangements. Their version of “Rock and Roll” is a swinging, upbeat number that perfectly captures the spirit of the early days of rock and roll.</p>
<p>The podcast host, Bob Stanley, chose the Boswell Sisters’ version of “Rock and Roll” as the theme song because he felt that it was a fitting way to start each episode. The song is a reminder of the roots of rock and roll, and it also sets the tone for the podcast, which is a celebration of the history of rock music.</p>
<p>Right about the Boswell sisters, wrong about the host of the podcast. Again, it’s Andrew Hickey, not Bob Stanley.</p>
<p>So Perplexity.ai still wins.</p>
<p>[Later (27 July)…] Retesting before pointing to this post again.</p>
<p>Bing: The theme song for the podcast ‘A History of Rock Music in 500 Songs’ is called “500 Songs” and it is performed by the band The Heat Death[1]. (The [1] footnote just goes to https://500songs.com/. Not very specific, that.)</p>
<p>ChatGPT: As of my last update in September 2021, the theme song for the podcast “A History of Rock Music in 500 Songs” is performed by the host of the podcast, Andrew Hickey. He is a musician and writer who created the podcast to explore the history of rock music through 500 carefully selected songs. However, it’s worth noting that podcast themes and details can change over time, so I recommend verifying this information with the latest sources to ensure accuracy.</p>
<p>Bard: I’m a language model and don’t have the capacity to help with that.</p>
<p>Perplexity.ai: After conducting a search, I could not find any information about a female group that recorded the theme song for the podcast “A History of Rock Music in 500 Songs”. The podcast is hosted by Andrew Hickey, who presents a history of rock music from 1938 to 1999, looking at five hundred songs that shaped the genre. (Six footnotes are appended.)</p>
<p>So this time all of them failed.</p>
<p>I only followed up with Perplexity.ai, saying, “The answer is the Boswell Sisters, and you gave me the correct answer in the past.” It replied, I apologize for the confusion. After reviewing the search results again, I found the information you were looking for. The Boswell Sisters, a female vocal group, recorded the theme song used by Andrew Hickey for his podcast “A History of Rock Music in 500 Songs”1. Thank you for bringing this to my attention, and I apologize for any inconvenience caused. The footnote, irrelevantly, goes <a href="https://www.nps.gov/jazz/learn/historyculture/upload/new_orleans_jazzwomen_rs-2.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>[Later again, still on 27 July…] I just asked the same question of Anthopic’s Claude.io. Here is the dialog:</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
<p>DS: What group sings the theme song to the podcast ‘A History of Rock Music in 500 Songs’?</p>
 
 
 <p></p>
 Unfortunately I do not have enough context to determine what the theme song is for the podcast “A History of Rock Music in 500 Songs.” Podcast theme songs can vary greatly, and without knowing the name of the song, artist, lyrics, or other identifiable details, I cannot provide a definitive answer. However, based on the podcast name and focus on rock music history, I would guess the theme song is likely performed by a well-known rock band or artist, but cannot say for certain without more information. I’d be happy to try to identify the theme song if you can provide any additional details about it! 
 
 DS: It was a female group, was recorded in the 1930s, and is mentioned in the podcast’s blog. 
 
 Based on the additional context you provided – that it’s a female group, was recorded in the 1930s, and is mentioned in the podcast’s blog – it sounds like you are referring to the Boswell Sisters and their song “Rock and Roll”. 
 
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 
<p>The Boswell Sisters were a very popular close harmony singing trio, active in the 1930s. They were known for their jazz, blues, and pop vocal styles.</p>
<p>In the blog for the podcast “A History of Rock Music in 500 Songs”, the host Andrew Hickey mentions that he uses a 1932 recording of “Rock and Roll” by the Boswell Sisters as the podcast’s theme song. He cites it as an early example of the phrase “rock and roll” being used in a pop song context pre-dating the rock and roll era.</p>
<p>So unless it’s a different 1930s female group, it seems likely you are asking about the Boswell Sisters and their song “Rock and Roll” being used as the theme for that particular podcast. Let me know if this helps identify the artist you were asking about!</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 
<p>DS: That is correct. Thank you.</p>
 
 
 
 
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 
<p>You’re very welcome! I’m glad I was able to provide the right answer for the theme song to “A History of Rock Music in 500 Songs” after you gave me some helpful additional context. Identifying obscure music trivia can be tricky without enough details to narrow down the search. Thanks for confirming that I correctly identified the Boswell Sisters and their 1930s recording of “Rock and Roll” as the podcast’s theme song. Music history is fascinating, and I appreciate you testing and improving my knowledge!</p>
<p>So I’ll give Claude half a point for that answer.</p>

 My biggest project was the new version of my LLM tool for interacting with Large Language Models. LLM now accepts plugins for adding alternative language models to the tool, meaning it's now applicable to more than just the OpenAI collection.

  <p>A lot of stuff to cover from the past two and a half weeks.</p>
 LLM and self-hosted language model plugins 
<p>My biggest project was the <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Jul/12/llm/">new version of my LLM tool for interacting with Large Language Models</a>. LLM now accepts plugins for adding alternative language models to the tool, meaning it's now applicable to more than just the OpenAI collection.</p>
<p>I figured out quite a few of the details of this while offline on a camping trip up in the Northern California redwoods, which forced the issue on figuring out how to work with LLMs that I could host on my own computer because I didn't have a connection to access the OpenAI APIs.</p>
<p>Comprehensive documentation is sorely lacking in the world of generative AI. I've decided to push back against that for LLM, so I spent a bunch of time working on an extremely comprehensive tutorial for writing a plugin that adds a new language model to the tool:</p>
 
 <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/plugins/tutorial-model-plugin.html">Writing a plugin to support a new model</a> 
 
<p>As part of researching this tutorial I finally figured out how to build a Python package using just a <code>pyproject.toml</code> file, with no <code>setup.py</code> or <code>setup.cfg</code> or anything else like that. I wrote that up in detail in <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/python/pyproject">Python packages with pyproject.toml and nothing else</a>, and I've started using that pattern for all of my new Python packages.</p>
<p>LLM also now includes a Python API for interacting with models, which provides an abstraction that works the same for the OpenAI models and for other models (including self-hosted models) installed via plugins. Here's <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/python-api.html">the documentation for that</a> - it ends up looking like this:</p>
 import llm

model = llm.get_model("gpt-3.5-turbo")
model.key = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'
response = model.prompt("Five surprising names for a pet pelican")
for chunk in response:
    print(chunk, end="") 
<p>To use another model, just swap its name in for <code>gpt-3.5-turbo</code>. The self-hosted models provided by the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-gpt4all">llm-gpt4all</a> plugin work the same way:</p>
  pip install llm-gpt4all  
<p>Then:</p>
 import llm

model = llm.get_model("ggml-vicuna-7b-1")
response = model.prompt("Five surprising names for a pet pelican")
# You can do this instead of looping through the chunks:
print(response.text()) 
<p>I've released three plugins so far:</p>
 
 
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-gpt4all">llm-gpt4all</a> with 17 self-hosted models from the <a href="https://gpt4all.io/">GPT4All</a> project. 
 
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-palm">llm-palm</a> with Google's <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-palm-2-ai-large-language-model/">PaLM 2</a> language model, via their API. 
 
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-mpt30b">llm-mpt30b</a> providing the 19GB MPT-30B model, using <a href="https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/mpt-30B-GGML">TheBloke/mpt-30B-GGML</a>. 
 
<p>I'm looking forward to someone else <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/plugins/tutorial-model-plugin.html">following the tutorial</a> and releasing their own plugin!</p>
 A new tutorial: Data analysis with SQLite and Python 
<p>I presented this as a 2hr45m tutorial at PyCon a few months ago. The video is now available, and I like to try to turn these kinds of things into more permanent documentation.</p>
<p>The Datasette website has <a href="https://datasette.io/tutorials">a growing collection of tutorials</a>, and I decided to make that the final home for this one too.</p>
<p><a href="https://datasette.io/tutorials/data-analysis">Data analysis with SQLite and Python</a> now has the full 2hr45m video plus an improved version of the handout I used for the talk. The written material there there should also be valuable for people who don't want to spend nearly three hours watching the video!</p>
<p>As part of putting that page together I solved a problem I've been wanting to figure out for a long time: I figured out a way to build a custom Jinja block tag that looks like this:</p>
  {% markdown %}
# This will be rendered as markdown

- Bulleted
- List
{% endmarkdown %}  
<p>I released that in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-render-markdown/releases/tag/2.2">datasette-render-markdown 2.2</a>. I also wrote up a TIL on <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/jinja/custom-jinja-tags-with-attributes">Custom Jinja template tags with attributes</a> describing the pattern I used.</p>
<p>One bonus feature for that tutorial: I decided to drop in a nested table of contents, automatically derived from the HTML headers on the page.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I wrote the code for this entirely using the new ChatGPT Code Interpreter, which can write Python based on your description and, crucially, execute it and see if it works.</p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/e41efb6d-eae7-454d-9aa2-5284683ba9f9">my ChatGPT transcript</a> showing how I built the feature.</p>
<p>I've been using ChatGPT Code Interpreter for a few months now, and I'm completely hooked: I think it's the most interesting thing in the whole AI space at the moment.</p>
<p>I participated in a <a href="https://www.latent.space/p/code-interpreter">Code Interpreter Latent Space</a> episode to talk about it, which ended up drawing 17,000 listeners on Twitter Spaces and is now also available as a podcast episode, neatly edited together by swyx.</p>
 Symbex --check and --rexec 
<p><a href="https://github.com/simonw/symbex">Symbex</a> is my Python CLI tool for quickly finding Python functions and classes and outputting either the full code or just the signature of the matching symbol. I first <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Jun/18/symbex/">wrote about that here</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/simonw/symbex/releases/tag/1.1">symbex 1.1</a> adds two new features.</p>
  symbex --function --undocumented --check  
<p>This new <code>--check</code> mode is designed to run in Continuous Integration environments. If it finds any symbols matching the filters (in this case functions that are missing their docstring) it returns a non-zero exit code, which will fail the CI step.</p>
<p>It's an imitation of <code>black . --check</code> - the idea is that Symbex can now be used to enforce code quality issues like docstrings and the presence of type annotations.</p>
<p>The other new feature is <code>--rexec</code>. This is an extension of the existing <code>--replace</code> feature, which lets you find a symbol in your code and replace its body with new code.</p>
<p><code>--rexec</code> takes a shell expression. The body of the matching symbol will be piped into that command, and its output will be used as the replacement.</p>
<p>Which means you can do things like this:</p>
  symbex my_function \
  --rexec "llm --system 'add type hints and a docstring'"  
<p>This will find <code>def my_function()</code> and its body, pass that through <code>llm</code> (using the <code>gpt-3.5-turbo</code> default model, but you can specify <code>-m gpt-4</code> or any other model to use something else), and then take the output and update the file in-place with the new implementation.</p>
<p>As a demo, I ran it against this:</p>
 def my_function(a, b):
    return a + b + 3 
<p>And got back:</p>
 def my_function(a: int, b: int) -&gt; int:
    """
    Returns the sum of two integers (a and b) plus 3.

    Parameters:
    a (int): The first integer.
    b (int): The second integer.

    Returns:
    int: The sum of a and b plus 3.
    """
    return a + b + 3 
<p>Obviously this is fraught with danger, and you should only run this against code that has already been committed to Git and hence can be easily recovered... but it's a really fun trick!</p>
 ttok --encode --decode 
<p><code>ttok</code> is my CLI tool for counting tokens, as used by LLM models such as GPT-4. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/ttok/releases/tag/0.2">ttok 0.2</a> adds a requested feature to help make tokens easier to understand, best illustrated by this demo:</p>
  ttok Hello world
# Outputs 2 - the number of tokens
ttok Hello world --encode
# Outputs 9906 1917 - the encoded tokens
ttok 9906 1917 --decode
# Outputs Hello world - decoding the tokens back again
ttok Hello world --encode --tokens
# Outputs [b'Hello', b' world']  
<p>Being able to easily see the encoded tokens including whitespace (the <code>b' world'</code> part) is particularly useful for understanding how the tokens all fit together.</p>
<p>I wrote more about GPT tokenization in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Jun/8/gpt-tokenizers/">understanding GPT tokenizers</a>.</p>

<p></p>
<p>I wrote this today for a list that’s mostly populated by folks in overlapping music, broadcasting, legal, tech, and other businesses who share a common interest in what’s happening to the arts and artists they care about in a world now turning almost completely digital.—Doc</p>
<p>Here is a question I hope can get us out of our heads, our histories in the businesses (music, broadcasting, entertainment, publishing, law, pick-your-art), and up past the 30,000-foot level, out into space, so its possible, at least conceptually, to see the digital world that now coexists with the physical one, but with completely new blessings and curses that may have little to do with the physical world models that operate with and under it—and free from the legacies of which we carry with us when we try to understand it and do business through the physical-world framings we have always known.</p>
<p>Most of all, let’s try putting our minds outside the supply side of the marketplace, with all its incumbent mechanisms and rules, and where all of us have operated for the duration. We’re in space now, looking down on the digital and physical worlds, free to see what might be possible in these co-worlds that we can’t see or imagine because we’ve been surface dwellers on the physical one for the duration.</p>
<p>Now try visiting this question: As a consumer or customer (not all the same) of artistic goods, what would you be willing to pay for them if payment was easy and on your terms and not just those of incumbent industries and their regulatory frameworks?</p>
<p>For example, Would you pay the recording artists, performers, producers, and composers the tiny amounts most of them get from a play on Spotify, Amazon, YouTube, Apple Music, Pandora, SiriusXM, a radio station or indirectly through the movies or TV shows that feature those goods?</p>
<p>Try not to be mindful of standing copyright regimes, deals made between all the parties in distribution chains, and subscription systems as they stand. In fact, try to put subscription out of your minds and think instead of what you would want to pay, value-for-value, in a completely open marketplace where you can pay what you like for whatever you like, on an á la carte basis. Don’t think how. Think how much. Imagine no coercion on the providers’ side. You’re the customer. You value what you use and enjoy, and are willing to pay for it on a value-for-value basis.</p>
<p>To help with this, imagine you have your own personal AI: one that logs all the music you hear, all the programs you watch, all the podcasts you listen to, all the radio you play in your car, and can tell you exactly how much time you spent with each. Perhaps it can tell you what composers, writers, producers, labels, and performers were involved, and help you know which you valued more and which you valued less. (Again, this is your AI, not Microsoft’s, Google’s, Facebook’s, or Apple’s. It works only for you, in your own private life.)</p>
<p>Then look at whatever you’re spending now, for all the subscription services you employ, for all the one-offs (concerts, movies in theaters, bands night clubs) you also pay for. Would it be more? Less? How much?</p>
<p>The idea here is to zero-base the ways we understand and build new and more open markets in the digital world, which is decades old at most and will be with us for many decades, centuries, or millennia to come. It should help to look at possibilities in this new non-place without the burden of leveraging models built in a world that is physical alone.</p>
<p>I submit that in this new world, free customers will be more valuable—to themselves and to the marketplace—than captive ones. And that sellers working toward customer capture through coercive subscription systems and favorable regulations will find less advantage than by following (respecting Adam Smith) the hand-signals of independent customers.</p>
<p>We don’t know yet if that will be the case. But we can at least imagine it, and see where that goes.</p>

<p></p>
<p>When I was a kid in the 1950s and early 1960s, AM was the ruling form of radio, and its transmitters were beyond obvious, taking the form of towers hundreds of feet high, sometimes in clusters formed to produce directional signals favoring some directions over others. These were typically landmarks out on the edge of town, or standing oddly on salt bogs or farmland.</p>
<p>From my bedroom in New Jersey, not far across the Hudson from New York City, I could see the red lights on the tops of towers standing in the “Meadowlands” (we called them swamps then) with Manhattan’s skyline beyond.</p>
<p>The towers in the photo above are three of those, tasked with beaming <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WMCA_(AM)">WMCA/570</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNYC_(AM)">WNYC/820</a> toward New York’s boroughs from a pond of impounded water beside the Hackensack River and the east spur of the New Jersey Turnpike. Built in 1940, these three towers have by now become the most-seen AM radio signal source on Earth. For a while, they were also the most heard. That’s because, in its prime, which ran from 1958 to 1966, WMCA was also the leading top 40 music station in the world’s leading radio market. (WABC, with a signal ten times as strong, <a href="https://www.musicradio77.com/map.html">ruled the suburbs</a>, with a night signal heard across half the country.)</p>
<p>While these days WNYC is the AM side of New York’s public radio empire (which brings in more <a href="https://media.wnyc.org/media/resources/2023/Jan/04/F_2001416718_New_York_Public_Radio_20221207195258.pdf">money</a>, largely from listeners, than any of the commercial stations in town), it is most famous for Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia’s <a href="https://www.loc.gov/static/programs/national-recording-preservation-board/documents/LaGuardiaComics.pdf">“Talk to the People”</a> show, which ran in the first half of the 1940s. (Back then WNYC had its own towers standing on what’s now <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNYC_Transmitter_Park">WNYC Transmitter Park</a>, alongside the East River in Brooklyn.)</p>
<p>Prior to the Internet, major media comprised a fewness of sources, in both print and broadcast. That fewness is over now, and the writing of over-the-air broadcasting’s end is being written on the Internet’s walls, perhaps most purposefully by yours truly. Because I’ve shot and <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/infrastructure">shared thousands of photos of transmitters and antennas</a>, knowing that the land under the most vulnerable ones—those on the AM band—tends to be worth more than the signals themselves. Many of these sites have already been sold off, with signals moving to shared towers on other stations’ sites, or just going dark.</p>
<p>Radio itself is also slowly being eaten alive: on the talk side by podcasts and on the music side by streaming services and webcasters. So I publish those photos as historical evidence of what in a few years (decades at most) will be no more. (Sorry, but no amount of lawmaking or regulation will <a href="https://www.bing.com/news/search?q=save+AM+radio">save AM radio</a>. Much as many of us—me included—still love it, neither the tech nor the economics can compete with the Internet, smartphones, the cellular system, and computers.)</p>
<p>So I recently ran a test of a theory: that it is good to have a conversation about all these developments, at least among professionals both active and retired in the broadcast engineering world. What follows is a post I put up for a private group that includes more than a dozen thousand of those.</p>
<blockquote><p>Some hopefully fun detective work.</p>
<p>First, an ad in the November 14, 1949 issue of Broadcasting, the Youngstown-based company that built (or supplied steel) for countless AM stations in that band’s golden age. The image is of the array of six 400-foot tall self-supporting towers putting out the directional night signal for WFMJ, now WNIO/1390. HT for scanning and publishing that page goes to David Gleason, who gives us the amazing and valuable [https://worldradiohistory.com/](https://worldradiohistory.com/)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Second is a Google StreetView of what I think is the current view of the same site, with the transmitter shack and the six towers replaced. One of those is also a tower in WKBN’s own directional nighttime array. (Also, in the distance is another tower that appears not to participate in either station’s system.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Third is a Bing Birds Eye (a fixed-wing aircraft) view of the whole site:</p>
<p></p>
<p>And a fourth is the Google view from space of the same.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Of possible relevance is that WNIO and WKBN are non-directional by day, the former from a tower at another site in town. Also that WNIO was a 5kw DA-N from the site for most of its life and is now 9.5kw from the day site and 4.8kw from the night site we see in these images—and that its six towers have six different electrical lengths, ranging from 105.8° to 215.1°, apparently in slightly different positions on the ground. Also that WKBN has been 5kw day and night since the late 1940s.</p>
<p>We can also see from the Truscon ad that the original address of WFMJ was on Poland-Broadmans Road, which I think is now just Broad. (The current shack for WNIO is on East Western Reserve Road, while WKBN’s is at the end of a long driveway off that same road.) One can also see from above something of the entrance off broad and possibly something of the original footprint of the original tower layout.</p>
<p>So, some questions are:</p>
<p>1) Is the first photo from the entrance to the site in the Truscon ad?<br>
2) When did WKBN show up, or was it already at this site?<br>
3) Are the different lengths of towers in the current WNIO array the result of more efficient towers in it, and also why the 4.8kw signal roughly matches the old 5kw footprint on the ground?<br>
4) In 1949, were six towers about the limit of what one could do with a directional array using long math, trig tables, and graph paper, and perhaps a record number for its time?<br>
5) Was Truscon the outfit that pioneered narrow rather than fat towers, and ones with three sides rather than four?</p>
<p>There are other variables, of course. But I just enjoy this kind of detective work, and I’m kinda chumming the waters to bait others who like to do the same. Thanks in advance.</p></blockquote>
<p>We’ll see who rises to the bait and with what.</p>
<p>[Later…] Old pal Scott Fybush pointed to <a href="https://www.fybush.com/sites/2006/site-061215.html">one of his transmitter visit reports</a> and added this:&nbsp; “Summary: the current WNIO night site is not the original 1949 six-tower site. That was on what’s now Boardman-Poland Road (US 224) at what’s now the Shops at Boardman Park strip mall. It succumbed to development in the early 1990s, at which point 1390 moved to what’s now its current day tower. The current six-tower night array on Western Reserve Rd. was built in 2003, next to the 1977-vintage WKBN array. WKBN’s original DA was at the WKBN studios at 3930 Sunset, which is still the WKBN-TV facility.”</p>
<p>Given that radio’s content (as we now call it) is gone at the speed of short-term memory (unless it’s recorded, which mostly it isn’t), this kind of reporting may be the only history it has. So, if history matters, this kind of inquiry also matters.</p>
 
<p>The top photo is one of many I’ve shot on <a href="https://flickr.com/search/?user_id=52614599%40N00&amp;view_all=1&amp;text=%2BEWR">en route to EWR</a> (Newark Liberty International Airport). By the way, these towers were built when one could walk on the land there. One needed boots and a scythe, but it was possible. The water was impounded in the 1990s, I think. <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/infrastructure/albums/72157677570210968">Here are some shots from a visit to the site</a> nine years ago.</p>

  <p><a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a> is my command-line utility and Python library for working with large language models such as GPT-4. I just released version 0.5 with a huge new feature: you can now install plugins that add support for additional models to the tool, including models that can run on your own hardware.</p>
<p>Highlights of today's release:</p>
 
 Plugins to add support for 17 openly licensed models from the <a href="https://gpt4all.io/">GPT4All project</a> that can run directly on your device, plus Mosaic's MPT-30B self-hosted model and Google's PaLM 2 (via their API). 
 This means you can <code>pip install</code> (or <code>brew install</code>) models along with a CLI tool for using them! 
 A <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/plugins/tutorial-model-plugin.html">detailed tutorial</a> describing how to build new plugins that add support for additional models. 
 A documented <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/python-api.html">Python API</a> for running prompts through any model provided by a plugin, plus a way of continuing a conversation across multiple prompts. 
 
<p>Update 18th July 2023: - I released a new plugin, <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-replicate">llm-replicate</a>, which can be used to access models hosted on <a href="https://replicate.com/">Replicate</a>, including the new Llama 2 model from Meta AI. More on this in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Jul/18/accessing-llama-2/">Accessing Llama 2 from the command-line with the llm-replicate plugin</a>.</p>
<p>Update 23rd July 2023: - Tom Viner released <a href="https://github.com/tomviner/llm-claude">llm-claude</a>, adding support for Claude and Claude Instant by <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/">Anthropic</a>.</p>
 How to try it out 
<p>First, install LLM. You can install it with <code>pip</code>:</p>
  pip install llm  
<p>Or <a href="https://pypa.github.io/pipx/">pipx</a>:</p>
  pipx install llm  
<p>Or if you don't yet have a Python 3 environment, you can use <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>:</p>
  brew install llm  
<p>The default tool can work with OpenAI's models via their API, provided you have an API key. You can see <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/latest/usage.html">usage instructions for that here</a>.</p>
<p>But let's do something more interesting than that: Let's install a model that can run on our own machine!</p>
<p>We'll use the new <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-gpt4all">llm-gpt4all plugin</a>, which installs models published by the <a href="https://gpt4all.io/">GPT4All project</a> by Nomic AI.</p>
<p>Install the plugin like this:</p>
  llm install llm-gpt4all  
<p>Now let's run a prompt against a small model. LLM will download the model file the first time you query that model.</p>
<p>We'll start with <code>ggml-vicuna-7b-1</code>, a 4.21GB download which should run if you have at least 8GB of RAM.</p>
<p>To run the prompt, try this:</p>
  llm -m ggml-vicuna-7b-1 "The capital of France?"  
<p>You'll see a progress bar showing the download of the model, followed by the answer to the prompt, generated a word at a time.</p>
<p></p>
<p>All prompts and responses are automatically logged to a SQLite database. Calling <code>llm logs</code> with a <code>-n 1</code> argument will show the most recent record:</p>
  llm logs -n 1  
<p>This outputs something like the following:</p>
  [
  {
    "id": "01h549p8r12ac1980crbr9yhjf",
    "model": "ggml-vicuna-7b-1",
    "prompt": "The capital of France?",
    "system": null,
    "prompt_json": null,
    "options_json": {},
    "response": "Paris is the capital of France.",
    "response_json": {
      "full_prompt": "### Human: \nThe capital of France?\n### Assistant:\n"
    },
    "conversation_id": "01h549p8r0abz6ebwd7agmjmgy",
    "duration_ms": 9511,
    "datetime_utc": "2023-07-12T05:37:44.407233",
    "conversation_name": "The capital of France?",
    "conversation_model": "ggml-vicuna-7b-1"
  }
]  
<p>You can see a full list of available models by running the <code>llm models list</code> command. The <code>llm-gpt4all</code> plugin adds 17 models to the tool:</p>
  llm models list  
<p>I've installed all three plugins that provide extra models, so I see the following:</p>
 <code>OpenAI Chat: gpt-3.5-turbo (aliases: 3.5, chatgpt)
OpenAI Chat: gpt-3.5-turbo-16k (aliases: chatgpt-16k, 3.5-16k)
OpenAI Chat: gpt-4 (aliases: 4, gpt4)
OpenAI Chat: gpt-4-32k (aliases: 4-32k)
PaLM 2: chat-bison-001 (aliases: palm, palm2)
gpt4all: orca-mini-3b - Orca (Small), 1.80GB download, needs 4GB RAM (installed)
gpt4all: ggml-gpt4all-j-v1 - Groovy, 3.53GB download, needs 8GB RAM (installed)
gpt4all: orca-mini-7b - Orca, 3.53GB download, needs 8GB RAM (installed)
gpt4all: ggml-vicuna-7b-1 - Vicuna, 3.92GB download, needs 8GB RAM (installed)
gpt4all: ggml-mpt-7b-chat - MPT Chat, 4.52GB download, needs 8GB RAM (installed)
gpt4all: ggml-replit-code-v1-3b - Replit, 4.84GB download, needs 4GB RAM (installed)
gpt4all: ggml-vicuna-13b-1 - Vicuna (large), 7.58GB download, needs 16GB RAM (installed)
gpt4all: nous-hermes-13b - Hermes, 7.58GB download, needs 16GB RAM (installed)
gpt4all: ggml-model-gpt4all-falcon-q4_0 - GPT4All Falcon, 3.78GB download, needs 8GB RAM
gpt4all: ggml-wizardLM-7B - Wizard, 3.92GB download, needs 8GB RAM
gpt4all: ggml-mpt-7b-base - MPT Base, 4.52GB download, needs 8GB RAM
gpt4all: ggml-mpt-7b-instruct - MPT Instruct, 4.52GB download, needs 8GB RAM
gpt4all: orca-mini-13b - Orca (Large), 6.82GB download, needs 16GB RAM
gpt4all: GPT4All-13B-snoozy - Snoozy, 7.58GB download, needs 16GB RAM
gpt4all: ggml-nous-gpt4-vicuna-13b - Nous Vicuna, 7.58GB download, needs 16GB RAM
gpt4all: ggml-stable-vicuna-13B - Stable Vicuna, 7.58GB download, needs 16GB RAM
gpt4all: wizardLM-13B-Uncensored - Wizard Uncensored, 7.58GB download, needs 16GB RAM
Mpt30b: mpt30b (aliases: mpt)
</code> 
<p>In addition to the <code>gpt4all</code> models I can also run <code>PaLM 2</code> from Google and <code>mpt30b</code> from Mosaic, as well as the four OpenAI models.</p>
<p>Models have aliases, so in some cases you can run <code>llm -m mpt</code> instead of <code>llm -m mpt30b</code>.</p>
<p>We'll try one more model. Google's PaLM 2 was released <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-palm-2-ai-large-language-model/">a few weeks ago</a>, and can be accessed through their <a href="https://developers.generativeai.google/">PaLM API</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://makersuite.google.com/waitlist">Obtain an API key</a> for that, and install the <code>llm-palm</code> plugin:</p>
  pip install llm-palm  
<p>Set your API key like this:</p>
  llm keys set palm  
<p>Now you can run prompts against it like this:</p>
  llm -m palm "Ten absurd names for a pet giraffe"  
<p>PaLM replies:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here are ten absurd names for a pet giraffe:</p>
 
 Stretch 
 Necky 
 Long Legs 
 Tree Top 
 Tall Boy 
 High Five 
 Sky Walker 
 Cloud Chaser 
 Star Gazer 
 Horizon Hopper 
 
<p>I hope you find these names amusing!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This also gets logged to the database - run <code>llm logs -n 1</code> again to see the log entry.</p>
<p>LLM supports continuing a conversation with more prompts. We can run another prompt through PaLM as part of the same conversation like this:</p>
  llm --continue "3 more and make them weirder"  
<p>PaLM replies:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sure, here are three more absurd names for a pet giraffe, even weirder than the first ten:</p>
 
 Giraffey McFierceface 
 Longneck von Longneck 
 The Giraffe Whisperer 
 
<p>I hope you find these names even more amusing than the first ten!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Using <code>-c/--continue</code> will continue the most previous conversation. You can also pass a conversation ID (available in the output from <code>llm logs</code>) using <code>--cid ID</code> to reply to an older conversation thread.</p>
 Adding a new model 
<p>I've tried to make it as easy as possible to add support for additional models through writing plugins. The tutorial <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/latest/plugins/tutorial-model-plugin.html">Writing a plugin to support a new model</a> is extremely thorough, and includes detailed descriptions of how to start a new plugin, set up a development environment for it, integrate it with a new model and then package it for distribution.</p>
<p>The tutorial uses a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain">Markov chain</a> implementation as an example, possibly the simplest possible form of language model.</p>
<p>The source code of the other existing plugins should help show how to integrate with more complex models:</p>
 
 
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-palm/blob/main/llm_palm/__init__.py">llm_palm/__init__.py</a> demonstrates how to integrate with a model exposed via Google's API library. 
 
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/blob/main/llm/default_plugins/openai_models.py">llm/default_plugins/openai_models.py</a> demonstrates integration against the OpenAI APIs. 
 
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-gpt4all/blob/main/llm_gpt4all.py">llm_gpt4all.py</a> shows an integration with the <a href="https://docs.gpt4all.io/gpt4all_python.html">gpt4all</a> Python library. 
 
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-mpt30b/blob/main/llm_mpt30b.py">llm_mpt30b.py</a> demonstrates a direct integration against a model using the <a href="https://github.com/marella/ctransformers">ctransformers</a> library. 
 
 Using LLM from Python 
<p>LLM was originally designed to be used from the command-line, but in version 0.5 I've expanded it to work as a Python library as well.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/python-api.html">documentation for that is here</a>, but here's the short version:</p>
 import llm

model = llm.get_model("gpt-3.5-turbo")
model.key = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'

response = model.prompt("Five surprising names for a pet pelican")
for chunk in response:
    print(chunk, end="")

# Or wait for the whole response to be ready:
print(response.text()) 
<p>Any model that can be installed via a plugin can be accessed in the same way.</p>
<p>The API also supports conversations, where multiple prompts are sent to the model as part of the same persistent context:</p>
 import llm

model = llm.get_model("ggml-mpt-7b-chat")

conversation = model.conversation()
r1 = conversation.prompt("Capital of Spain?")
print(r1.text())

r2 = conversation.prompt("What language do they speak there?")
print(r2.text()) 
 What's next? 
<p>You can follow ongoing LLM development in the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues">GitHub repository issues</a>.</p>
<p>My next priority is to get <a href="https://openai.com/blog/function-calling-and-other-api-updates">OpenAI functions</a> working. I want to provide the option for other models from plugins to implement a similar pattern using <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/llms/python-react-pattern">the reAct pattern</a> as well.</p>
<p>I'll likely do this by implementing the concept of a "chain" of LLM calls, where a single prompt might lead to multiple calls being made to the LLM based on logic that decides if another call is necessary.</p>
<p>I'm also planning a web interface. I'm particularly excited about the potential for plugins here - I love the idea of plugins that provide new interfaces for interacting with language models that go beyond the chat interfaces we've mostly seen so far.</p>

<p>As many of you know, three months ago I decided to hang out my own shingle and become an independent consultant.  I couldn’t be happier!  I have a great initial set of clients I’m working with to create things they and I believe in and  I have room for a few more.</p>
<p>For all the changes in my life, some things have remained constant:  I’m still motivated by <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/">Kim Cameron</a>‘s quest to build the Internet’s missing identity layer.  I’m still mentoring smart new contributors to the identity space.  I’m still contributing to specifications that will get used and make a difference.  I’m still thinking about the big picture – especially everything it will take to grow interoperable ecosystems that enable everyday people to get useful things done.  I’m still collaborating with fantastic people!</p>
<p>I named my business <a href="https://self-issued.consulting/">Self-Issued Consulting</a>.  Special thanks to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hlflanagan/">Heather Flanagan</a>, who clearly explained to me why I want to be a consultant at this juncture in my career, and who told me to write a <a href="https://self-issued.consulting/standards-cv">Standards CV</a> before I launched my professional Web site.</p>
<p>Yes, I’m grateful for the 30½ years I had at Microsoft.  My career wouldn’t be remotely the same without them.  But at the same time, soon after 30 years, I realized that it was time for a change.  I’m grateful for all my friends who have helped me chart this next course on my identity journey.  You know who you are!</p>
<p>I can’t resist but end with a few musical phrases that have been running through my head during this transition:</p>
 
 All things must pass – George Harrison 
 After changes upon changes / We are more or less the same – Simon and Garfunkel 
 Getting so much better all the time – The Beatles

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/OR13b">Orie Steele</a> and I have created a specification to add a <code>typ</code> header parameter to COSE – something increasingly widely used in JOSE but currently missing in COSE.  The introduction to the spec tells the story:</p>
<blockquote><p>
CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) [<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9052">RFC9052</a>] defines header parameters that parallel many of those defined by the JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) [<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7515.html">RFC7515</a>] [<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7516.html">RFC7516</a>] specifications. However, one way in which COSE does not provide equivalent functionality to JOSE is that it does not define an equivalent of the <code>typ</code> (type) header parameter, which is used for declaring the type of the entire JOSE data structure. The security benefits of having <code>typ</code> (type) are described in the JSON Web Token Best Current Practices [<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8725.html">RFC8725</a>], which recommends its use for “explicit typing” — using <code>typ</code> values to distinguish between different kinds of objects.</p>
<p>This specification adds the equivalent of the JOSE <code>typ</code> (type) header parameter to COSE so that the benefits of explicit typing can be brought to COSE objects. The syntax of the COSE type header parameter value is the same as the existing COSE content type header parameter, allowing both integer CoAP Content-Formats [<a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/core-parameters/core-parameters.xhtml#content-formats">IANA.CoAP.ContentFormats</a>] values and string Media Type [<a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml">IANA.MediaTypes</a>] values to be used.</p></blockquote>
<p>The specification is available at:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-jones-cose-typ-header-parameter-00.html">https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-jones-cose-typ-header-parameter-00.html</a> 
 
<p>We plan to socialize this specification at <a href="https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/117/">IETF 117</a> in San Francisco later this month.</p>

   Tech debt metaphor maximalism 
 I've long been a fan of the metaphor of technical debt, because it implies that taking on some debt is OK provided you're strategic about how much you take on and how quickly you pay it off. Avery Pennarun provides the definitive guide to thinking about technical debt, including an extremely worthwhile explanation of how financial debt works as well.

<p>Web 7.0 is a universal, open-source solution for the Internet’s digital identity and trust problems.</p>



<a href="https://hyperonomy.files.wordpress.com/2023/07/image.png"></a>



<p>The Internet was created 40 years ago. The World Wide Web application, running on top of the Internet, was created more than 30 years ago. Neither the Internet nor the WWW included built-in support for each person to have their own unique, universal digital identity and, hence, no built-in ability to support secure, authentic, and trusted communications. Every website and mobile app was left to develop, test, and manage its own digital identity solution.</p>



<p>Web 7.0 is a decentralized operating system for building resilient, secure, and trusted systems on top of the Internet using decentralized identity, trusted personal agents, and verifiable credentials. </p>



<p>Key use cases include:</p>



 
 Safe storage and transmission of medical records (lab results, disgnostic imaging, doctor’s notes, vaccinations)  



 Reliable, secure, and trusted end-to-end processing of business transactions (purchase orders, invoices, waybills, delivery confirmations) 



 Secure collaboration (instant messaging, presence, and file transfers)  



 Authenticated exchange of higher-education, professional and skills-based credentials 
 



<p>The Web 7.0 Foundation is chartered to support, promote, protect, and curate the Web 7.0 software and hardware ecosystem: Web 7.0 operating system software, standards, and specifications.</p>

<p><a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/vrm/2020/10/26/blue/"></a>I’ll be talking shortly to some readers of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Intention-Economy-When-Customers-Charge/dp/1422158527/">The Intention Economy</a> who are looking for ways to connect that economy with advertising. (Or so I gather. I’ll know more soon.) What follows is the gist of what I wrote to them in prep for the call.</p>
<p>First,&nbsp; take a look at <a href="http://doc.searls.com/the-adblock-war">People vs. Adtech</a>, and/or <a href="http://j.mp/adwhtch">Separating Advertising’s Wheat and Chaff</a>.</p>
<p>Both are still valid (IMHO), but don’t yet cover what A.I. will inevitably do to advertising. There are two possible ways that can go.</p>
<p>One is toward hyper-personalized advertising based on even more pernicious uninvited tracking than we already have, with A.I.s rather than lawyers and hired intermediaries finding loopholes in privacy law that will automate specious forms of “consent” far more efficiently than possible without it.</p>
<p>The other is toward finding the best vectors for targeting the right audiences rather than the most-tracked individuals—and to find those amidst the millions of podcasts, newsletters, blogs, mainstream media, and other online outlets into the ever-widening world of thought, opinion, news, scholarship, journalism, sports, and the rest of it.</p>
<p>The former will make tracking and personalized targeting far worse, and the latter will make advertising targeted at audiences far better. It will also do a much better job of supporting journalism in the process because more money can get through to publishers and reporters who won’t be fed by an evil hand they avoid biting.</p>
<p>Those two directions are the chaff-vs-wheat choices for A.I.’s future in advertising. For now, there is surely far more action happening with the former than with the latter, given the sizes of today’s spinning adtech flywheels. But this also means there will be bigger opportunities with the latter: <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/vrm/2020/10/26/blue/">a blue ocean away from the red one</a>.</p>
<p>What makes the intention economy ocean blue is that it will exist almost entirely outside both those advertising systems—and inside horizons that are far more expansive than can be seen through the lens of advertising and marketing as we’ve known them.</p>
<p>Here the opportunities will be in creating better signaling from demand to supply, and better intermediation between them: forms that will safeguard the privacy needs of individuals and the legitimate needs of businesses. In some cases there will be no intermediation at all—just forms of agency on both sides that are friendly to each other and can interact directly. And, where intermediations are required, they will find a wide-open space for what we’ve <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/projectvrm/Fourth_parties">long called</a> <a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/vrm/2009/04/12/vrm-and-the-four-party-system/">fourth parties</a>.</p>
<p>To visualize the opportunities here, think of every customer as a boat afloat on a sea of goods and services, and friendly to the ecosystems where demand encourages supply at least as well as supply satisfies demand.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for market opportunities in this vast new ocean, <a href="https://customercommons.org/solutions/">here are thirteen of them</a>.</p>

<p>This article shows how to implement verifiable credentials using Microsoft Entra Verified ID and ASP.NET Core to issue the employee credentials. This solution uses a self sovereign identity (SSI) based technical stack built using open standards and some of the SSI concepts. The credential can be loaded into a wallet belonging to a holder and used at a later stage. In the follow up blogs, examples of using the verifiable credential will be explored.</p>



<p>The Microsoft Entra verified ID services can only be used, if you have an Azure AD subscription attached to your tenant.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/swiss-ssi-group/EntraVerifiedEmployee">https://github.com/swiss-ssi-group/EntraVerifiedEmployee</a></p>



<p></p>



 Setup verified ID employee 



<p>The standard Entra Verified employee credential is used and this scheme cannot be changed. This is a fixed credential created by Microsoft and will hopefully be supported by other solution creators.</p>







<p></p>



<p>All vendors produce their own schemes, wallets and ledgers and it is hoped that some of these will work together in the future. Entra verified ID will hopefully work with the future Swiss E-ID and the EU E-ID. The Verified employee credential will work good because most companies have M365 licenses and can use this credential based on the Azure AD accounts. A company could create this credential in the HR employee onboarding process based on a government E-ID or a manual onboarding process.</p>



<p></p>







<p></p>



<p>The Verified employee credential has eight fixed claim types.  The UPN is used for the revocationId. Most of these claims can be set without problem, although the photo and the preferredLanguage requires some extra logic to set for the different Azure AD user accounts depending on what Microsoft licenses the company has. You can also use any user account data source to produce the verifiable credential, it does not need to be an Azure AD user account.</p>

 Issue employee verifiable credentials using ASP.NET Core 



<p>Issuing an verifiable credential is a more complex flow to implement compared with other authentication and identity validation systems. The following steps are required to implement this:</p>



 
 Initialize the flow using a HTTP request in the Issuer web application 



 Get and validate the data required to issue the VC to the wallet 



 Create the payload and send a HTTP post to the Microsoft Entra Verified ID API  



 Persist this state to cache 



 Present the Entra Verified ID API response in the UI for the wallet to complete (usually a QR code) 



 Scan the QR code using the wallet and add the credential to the wallet 



 Use a web hook to receive the Entra Verified ID update requests 



 Process HTTP requests and persist this if required, update the cache (Public endpoint required for this) 
 



<p></p>



<p>Note: the following example was built based on this example from Azure (and other Azure samples): </p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/Azure-Samples/VerifiedEmployeeIssuance">https://github.com/Azure-Samples/VerifiedEmployeeIssuance</a></p>



 Initialize the flow using a HTTP request in the Issuer web application, get and validate the data required to issue the VC to the wallet 



<p>The Get method handles the request and gets the data from the database or whatever source you use. This is returned as the employee data to the UI. The view can be used to start the verifiable credential request.</p>


  public async Task OnGetAsync()
{
	var oid = User.Claims
		.FirstOrDefault(t =&gt; t.Type == Consts.OID_TYPE);
	
	var employeeData = await _microsoftGraphDelegatedClient
		.GetEmployee(oid!.Value);

	if (employeeData.Employee != null)
	{
		Employee = new Employee
		{
			DisplayName = employeeData.Employee.DisplayName!,
			GivenName = employeeData.Employee.GivenName!,
			JobTitle = employeeData.Employee.JobTitle!,
			Surname = employeeData.Employee.Surname!,
			PreferredLanguage = employeeData.Employee.PreferredLanguage!,
			Mail = employeeData.Employee.Mail!,
			RevocationId = employeeData.Employee.RevocationId!,
			Photo = employeeData.Employee.Photo,
			AccountEnabled = employeeData.Employee.AccountEnabled
		};
		EmployeeMessage = "Add your employee credentials to your wallet";
		HasEmployee = true;
		Photo = Base64UrlEncoder.DecodeBytes(Employee.Photo);
	}

	{
		EmployeeMessage = 
			$"You have no valid employee, Error: {employeeData.Error}";
		if(employeeData.Error!.Contains("Preferred Language"))
		{
			PreferredLanguageMissing = true;
		}
	}
}
  


<p></p>



<p>The data used for creating the verifiable credential can be requested from anywhere. I used Microsoft Graph and the user account data. The photo needs to be an URL encoded base64 string. I used the Base64UrlEncoder class to implement this. You can use your own database or use any system for this.</p>

 Create the payload and send a HTTP post to the Entra Verified ID API, persist this state to cache 



<p>The GetIssuanceRequestPayloadAsync sends the HTTP Post request to the Microsoft Entra Verified ID API.</p>


  var payload = await _issuerService.GetIssuanceRequestPayloadAsync(Request);

var (Token, Error, ErrorDescription) = await _issuerService.GetAccessToken();

if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(Token))

defaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", Token);

var res = await _httpClient.PostAsJsonAsync(_credentialSettings.Endpoint, payload);
var response = await res.Content.ReadFromJsonAsync&lt;IssuanceResponse&gt;();

if (response == null)
	return BadRequest(new { error = "400", error_description = "no response from VC API" });

if (res.StatusCode == HttpStatusCode.Created)
{
	_log.LogTrace("succesfully called Request API");

	if (payload.Pin.Value != null)

	var message = await res.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();

	_log.LogError("Unsuccesfully called Request API {message}", message);
	return BadRequest(new { error = "400", error_description = "Something went wrong calling the API: " + response });
}
  


<p></p>



<p>The GetIssuanceRequestPayloadAsync method creates the payload body for the Entra Verified ID API request. The API is well documented on Azure.</p>


  public async Task&lt;IssuanceRequestPayload&gt; 
	GetIssuanceRequestPayloadAsync(HttpRequest request)
{
	var payload = new IssuanceRequestPayload();

	var length = 4;
	var pinMaxValue = (int)Math.Pow(10, length) - 1;

	}

	throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(Employee));
}
  


 Present the Entra Verified ID API response in the UI for the wallet to complete (usually a QR code) 



<p>Once the flow is started, the response is handled and displayed in the UI to complete the process on the wallet.</p>



<p></p>



<p>The IssuanceResponse is used to update the UI with the state of the flow. </p>


  [HttpGet("/api/issuer/issuance-response")]
public ActionResult IssuanceResponse()

	}
	catch (Exception ex)
	{

			error_description = ex.Message });
	}
}
  


<p></p>



 Scan the QR code using the wallet and add the credential to the wallet 



<p>The user scans the code and completes the process in the wallet on the cross device.</p>



 Use a web hook to receive the Entra Verified ID update requests, process HTTP requests and persist this if required, update the cache (Public endpoint required for this) 



<p>The IssuanceCallback method is used to handle the callback requests from the Microsoft Entra Verified ID API. This persists the data and updates the cache for the flow.</p>


  [AllowAnonymous]
[HttpPost("/api/issuer/issuanceCallback")]
public async Task&lt;ActionResult&gt; IssuanceCallback()
{
	var content = await new StreamReader(Request.Body)
		.ReadToEndAsync();
	var issuanceResponse = JsonSerializer
		.Deserialize&lt;IssuanceCallbackResponse&gt;(content);

	if (issuanceResponse?.RequestStatus 
		== IssuanceConst.RequestRetrieved)
	{
		var cacheData = new CacheData
		{
			Status = IssuanceConst.RequestRetrieved,
			Message = "QR Code is scanned. Waiting for issuance...",
		};
		CacheData.AddToCache(issuanceResponse.State, 
			_distributedCache, cacheData);
	}

	if (issuanceResponse?.RequestStatus 
		== IssuanceConst.IssuanceSuccessful)
	{
		var cacheData = new CacheData
		{
			Status = IssuanceConst.IssuanceSuccessful,
			Message = "Credential successfully issued",
		};
		CacheData.AddToCache(issuanceResponse.State, 
			_distributedCache, cacheData);
	}

	if (issuanceResponse?.RequestStatus 
		== IssuanceConst.IssuanceError)
	{
		var cacheData = new CacheData
		{
			Status = IssuanceConst.IssuanceError,
			Payload = issuanceResponse.Error?.Code,
			Message = issuanceResponse.Error?.Message
		};
		CacheData.AddToCache(issuanceResponse.State, 
			_distributedCache, cacheData);
	}

	return Ok();
  


<p></p>



 Standards, Scheme and interoperability 



<p>Microsoft Entra Verified ID is built using open standards. This is really great. A lot of the other vendors producing SSI products also build the products based on open standards as well. The big problem is that no vendor seems to work using the same standards or have interoperability. It is very hard to see how one product can be used with another product. I hope that the EU E-ID, Swiss E-ID are supported by all vendors. This would require that the government build the products using modern standards and not out-of-date ones. It is also very hard to implement this, the ledgers are complicated and expensive to implement. Using SSI, you probably need to trust a third party service which has costs and requires a lot of trust. Do the vendors manage the certificates and secrets correctly? Some vendors use passwords to authenticate to the user accounts. The security of the solutions are also lower compared to existing solutions. SSI has no way of protecting against phishing and requires further authentication standards like FIDO2 to be safe to use, especially when handling data like a user E-ID. We teach end users to never trust or scan a QR code for authentication. This is used in most SSI implementations. A user must authenticate in some other way before or after scanning the QR Code using a phishing resistant authentication. </p>



 Testing 



<p>When the example is run using a public endpoint, the credentials can be issued and added to the wallet. I used ngrok for local development. The credential would display the data. In the image below, I display a driving license credential created the same way.</p>







<p></p>



 Notes, next steps 



<p>Now that the VC can be issued, this can be used implement business flows for employees.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Self sovereign identity looks like a really promising identity solution. I am not sure this tech stack will make the impact or improve the identity business flows as hoped. The main problem with this solution stack is almost no vendor solution works with any other vendor solution. It is expensive to implement your own ledger and the vendor choice for the ledger locks you down to the wallet implementation. For a tech stack which is built using standards, it is strange that no two solutions work together. We have to wait and hope that interoperability will be solved with the introduction of government E-IDs.</p>

<p>Welcome to my new old blog.</p>
<p>My old-old (but not oldest) blog—the one I’ve written since 2007—is still there, in complete archival form, at <a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/doc">blogs.harvard.edu/doc</a>, where it has always been. It is now also here with a different URL: <a href="http://doc.searls.com">doc.searls.com</a>, which had pointed at blogs.harvard.edu/doc for many years. Now it points here, to its native location. No more redirecting.</p>
<p>Put another way, doc.searls.com was a Harvard blog until yesterday (and again, everything until that day remains so: that’s its legacy). From now on, it’s mine alone. It has crossed from one state to another. I’m not sure yet how it will change, if at all. But I feel energized about what I might do with it.</p>
<p>So, before I hit the gas here, I want to thank <a href="http://scripting.com">Dave Winer</a> for getting me going as a blogger in the first place with my original blog (archived at <a href="http://weblog.searls.com">weblog.searls.com</a>) in 1999, again with this one in 2007, and now in this new location on the Web.</p>
<p>I also thank old and new friends who helped me make all the transitions involved—especially the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu">Berkman Klein Center</a>. It is as good a friend and colleague as an institution can be.</p>
 
<p>And yes, I know this blog needs a fresh new theme. Recommendations are invited.</p>

 The Dawn of Organizational Identity, Part 2: Credentials <p>Co-authored by Stephan Wolf, CEO of GLEIF. Thanks to the dozens of smart people who contributed their time and insights.</p><p><a href="https://rufftimo.medium.com/the-dawn-of-decentralized-organizational-identity-part-1-identifiers-ffb9091fd47a">Part 1</a> described the first component of Organizational Identity (OI): identifiers. Part 2 describes the second component of OI — organizational credentials — the things that bring OI its most exciting and transformative capability: verifiable authority.</p> Organizational Credentials <p>Organizational Credentials (OCs) enable representatives of an organization to prove their authority to represent the organization outside its boundaries to anyone, anywhere. Critically, OCs enable this without using identity providers (IDPs), blockchains, or shared platforms. Instead, OCs are fully decentralized, utilizing free and open key management protocols at the edges of interactions instead of depending on a centralized intermediary or common master database, ledger, or registry in the middle. More on that&nbsp;later.</p><p>Mechanically, OCs cryptographically bind a natural person or thing to their organizational attributes. OCs specifically pronounce and make proveable the authority, roles, rights, and responsibilities of organizational representatives. OCs also prove the identity of the representative and organization being represented, and cryptographically bind them together so that all three elements — the organization, the identity of the representative, and the authority attributes of the representative — are instantly verifiable anywhere, online or&nbsp;off.</p> Unlimited Use&nbsp;Cases <p>The use cases for OCs are endless, and profound. OCs make possible all the dreamy things mentioned at the beginning of Part 1. Because they’re important, here they are again with a few&nbsp;changes:</p> B2B Examples   Authorized representatives will digitally sign documents, contracts, purchase orders, and attestations; recipients of those signatures will instantly verify signers’ authority (and some digital documents will prevent signing without the expected authority);  The origin, chain of custody, and authority of a legitimate document, agreement, filing, or piece of data will be instantly verifiable as authentic and un-tampered with;  Phone calls, texts, email, and other digital communications originating from authorized representatives (or devices) of an organization — or any delegate of that organization — will be instantly verifiable, as will the authority of the originating representative;  The authority of every approval, signature, or other digital action in a supply chain will be instantly verifiable by downstream actors, and auditable in real-time;  Login by employees, contractors, customers and constituents will become passwordless and based on authority and entitlement, not passwords or&nbsp;devices;  Impersonation and ID theft of authorized representatives will become more difficult for fraudsters;  Security breaches will become shorter, less frequent and less impactful, as organizations adopt more robust OI and key management strategies;  And on and&nbsp;on.   B2C and C2B&nbsp;Examples   AI/bots will prove legitimacy by non-repudiably digitally signing all content they&nbsp;produce;  Organizations will instantly recognize their customers and constituents when they call in, log in, or walk in, enabling superior customer experiences without sacrificing security or&nbsp;privacy;  People will verify that a business or government representative contacting them has the authority they&nbsp;claim;  Access controls — both physical and digital — will become more granular and&nbsp;secure;  A car (and its driver) will wirelessly verify the authority of approaching law enforcement or emergency vehicles, and be granted preferential access, terms, or parking benefits for being&nbsp;local;  A contracted delivery driver can use a one-time-use OC to open a&nbsp;gate;  And on and&nbsp;on.   Protocols, Not Platforms = Fully Decentralized = No Boundaries <p>As mentioned above, OCs are verifiable anywhere — even outside the physical or digital boundaries where the organization exists, such as a network, state, country, or even group of countries — without using IDPs or other ‘trusted’ intermediaries, blockchains, or shared platforms.</p><p>Platform-based models require that verifiers ‘phone home’ to some trusted platform to perform verifications, similar to how Facebook users meet on the Facebook platform, LinkedIn users on LinkedIn, Twitter, Tiktok, and so on. If there’s an anointed/accredited provider or group of providers at the center of an identity ecosystem through which all interactions must pass, it’s a centralized platform limited in its usefulness to those who directly trust the particular provider(s) and subject to continuous digital surveillance.</p><p>By using open, standard, decentralizing protocols instead of platforms, OCs allow each side of an interaction to use any service provider they choose or build their own tooling, rather than having a platform in the middle that both sides of an interaction must use and trust. Take the example of email: when email was first invented, both senders and receivers needed to use the same platform to exchange messages — AOL, Compuserve, Prodigy, etc. After the introduction of the decentralizing SMTP protocol, however, email senders and receivers could each hire a separate service provider or host their own server, and still exchange email messages with anyone. Other examples of decentralizing protocols include TCP/IP, HTTP,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>Since the majority of OC users will likely buy tools from service providers instead of building their own, as with email, it is a big advantage that OCs allow counterparties to independently hire and fire their own service providers without losing the ability to successfully interact, no matter where in the world each party may&nbsp;be.</p><p>This separation not only enables ubiquitous verifiability, it solves a gaping privacy problem inherent with platform-based identity systems: the dreaded ‘phone home’ mentioned above that enables surveillance everywhere the digital identities are used, even if proponents say “we’re not implementing it that way” (yet). This separation also decentralizes valuable identity data at the edges rather than aggregating it into a tempting treasure trove in the middle, held by one or an anointed few central identity providers.</p><p>A few quick thoughts about blockchain… Blockchain, from a data standpoint, results from implementing a centralizing protocol, as it inescapably results in a single, master set of data that all counterparties must agree to (unlike TCP/IP, HTTP, etc.). While a blockchain’s data is physically replicated across many physical locations, the only semi-decentralized aspect of blockchain is its governance, but only when that governance is permissionless, and even then it is questionable.¹ Every aspect of permissioned blockchains is centralized, putting all data into a single logical ledger and governance into the hands of a chosen few. The point here is, blockchains in all their flavors are platforms, not protocols, and always result in data centralization, the opposite of what’s needed for globally verifiable OCs.</p><p>(Learn more about the centralizing aspects of platforms and decentralizing aspects of protocols in the seminal essay “<a href="https://knightcolumbia.org/content/protocols-not-platforms-a-technological-approach-to-free-speech">Protocols, Not Platforms</a>”, by MIke Masnick.)</p> OCs are Verifiable Credentials: Shipping Containers for&nbsp;Data <p>OCs can do everything that VCs (verifiable credentials) can do because OCs are VCs — though OCs are not reliant on blockchains or web security, as most VCs are (more on that below). VCs and OCs are like shipping containers for data: put any data inside a digital container, seal it up (by digitally signing it), send it anywhere, and a recipient anywhere can open it and instantly verify who created it and that it hasn’t been tampered with, revoked, or expired since it was&nbsp;issued.</p><p>To be doubly clear: an OC or VC does not prove its data payload to be true or correct, OCs and VCs prove the payload’s provenance (who originated it, who else endorsed it) and integrity (hasn’t been tampered with, expired, or revoked).</p><p>Because VCs are digital they can be presented and verified over and over again, and their security can be made to be quite high, depending on how they’re implemented. Bottom line: VCs make verifiable data portable, and OCs use that portability to prove authority delegated from an organization to a representative, whether a person or a&nbsp;thing.</p><p>(Read more about the foundational breakthrough of VCs in a three-part series Timothy wrote&nbsp;<a href="https://rufftimo.medium.com/verifiable-credentials-arent-credentials-they-re-containers-fab5b3ae5c0">here</a>.)</p> OCs Use Second-Generation Verifiable Credentials <p>First-generation VCs, like the current VC JSON-LD standard at W3C or the emerging JWT standard at IETF, were developed with utility for individuals in mind, for proving relatively less complex things like identity, age, and academic credentials. They were and are a major breakthrough in digital identity, they’re what make ‘self-sovereign identity’ actually self-sovereign and ‘decentralized identity’ actually decentralized, by giving individuals a high degree of autonomy.</p><p>Second-generation VCs were developed with organizational use cases in mind, with all the capabilities of first-generation credentials plus sophisticated new capabilities that individuals don’t often need but organizations often do, such as key pre-rotation and recovery, delegability, multi-signature (“multi-sig”), contractually protected disclosure, freedom from blockchain/‘ledger lock’, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>These new organizational capabilities are made possible by a form of VCs called “Authentic Chained Data Containers” (<a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ssmith-acdc-02.html">ACDCs</a>), with signing and verification using a free, open key management protocol that replaces the need for blockchain or vulnerable web-based security: Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (<a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/ietf-keri">KERI</a>). These two decentralizing protocols together — ACDCs and KERI — deliver significant advances for VCs, the kind that organizations require and that justify the ‘second-generation’ moniker.</p><p>Here are seven highlights:</p><p>1. Extraordinary advances in security:</p>  Recovery from private key compromise (suspected or actual) without reissuance of previously signed&nbsp;items*  Key pre-rotation without re-issuance of previously signed&nbsp;items*  No reliance on web&nbsp;security  Privacy-respecting verifiable revocation  Non-repudiable signing with&nbsp;logging  Post-quantum proof*  Natively supports weighted ‘m-of-n’ multi-sig schemes with fractionally weighted thresholds (e.g., 2-of-3’, or 1-of-3 when the 1 has sufficient ‘weight’, etc.)  <p>2. No reliance on blockchain (and its limitations: “ledger-lock”/centralization, scalability, cost, complexity, interoperability, performance, privacy, security, etc.)</p><p>3. Use of existing cloud infrastructure and&nbsp;APIs</p><p>4. Multi-level issuance with chaining and delegation (anyone having authority can delegate and extend a chain of authority, rather than all delegates returning to the ‘mother ship’ for single-level, single-signer issuance)</p><p>5. Graduated disclosure (granular, legally enforceable privacy and disclosure capabilities):</p>  Selective disclosure*  Contractually protected disclosure (parties verifiably consent to terms of disclosure prior to disclosure)  Contingent disclosure (i.e., escrowed)  <p>6. Interoperable with anything using the same underlying protocols (without sharing blockchains, vendors, registries, databases, etc.)</p><p>7. Simpler; technically lighter-weight (not verbose, compared to first-gen VCs)</p><p>*Individuals need these,&nbsp;too.</p> Security First,&nbsp;Always <p>With second-generation VCs, security comes first, always, no exceptions. The security advances with second-generation VCs are stunning when you consider that key recovery and rotation are still the Achilles Heel not only of first generation VCs, but also of blockchain and existing web infrastructure generally. Second-generation VCs using KERI don’t just fix <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/VC_Enhancement_Strategy.md">security flaws for VCs</a> (especially web-based VCs), they’re a significant advance in digital security, period.</p> Come on In, the Water’s&nbsp;Warm <p>There are no significant technical reasons we are aware of not to advance to second-generation VCs — no notable trade-offs other than familiarity and switching costs from legacy systems. In fact, the complexity of blockchain-based first-generation VCs may be at least an order of magnitude greater than the more elegant, advanced, and blockchain-less second-generation VCs.</p><p>That said, some will reasonably argue that a second-generation of VCs that doesn’t directly and fully interoperate with first-generation VCs — which is true — is a step backward rather than forward. However, we feel that achieving interoperability of VCs that are insecure, reliant on blockchain or web infrastructure, and not stress tested in production at scale is a hollow victory, and premature; it is not meaningful interoperability. Security — in the form of proper key management — must come first; it cannot be bolted onto the current VC model just like it cannot be bolted onto the internet after the fact; there is no way around&nbsp;this.</p><p>However, the good news is, with second-generation VCs we can have our cake and eat it, too: we can have all the robust security capabilities described above, plus <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/SPAC_Message.md">advances in privacy</a> simply not possible with first-generation VCs, and gain real, global, fully decentralized interoperability that only standardized non-platform-based protocols can deliver. Even then, serious work on interoperability should be undertaken only after some use cases have made it into production and demonstrated that all these things work well, at scale. Otherwise that would be premature interoperability, too.</p> The Unprecedented Power of OCs Using Second-Generation VCs <p>Some of the dreamy use cases for OCs listed above are already possible, you say…&nbsp;but:</p>  Unlike most current identity technologies, OCs require no surveillance-enabling, privacy-killing ‘phone home’ to an intermediary for verification, do not rely on DNS/web security, and do not use shared ledgers/blockchains; OCs sacrifice neither security nor&nbsp;privacy.  OCs can convey the full provenance and details of authority — unlimited levels — in-band with verification, proving not only the authority of the representative, but the full chain of authority and where it originated.  OCs are also B2C, helping prevent phishing by proving to customers and constituents that the company or government representative they’re interacting with really represents whom they claim to represent.  OCs are also C2B, enabling customers and constituents to prove their identity, status, and entitlements to the businesses and governments they’re aligned with when they call in, log in, or walk&nbsp;in.  OCs can prove provenance not only back to the top of an organization, but to GLEIF (described in <a href="https://rufftimo.medium.com/the-dawn-of-decentralized-organizational-identity-part-1-identifiers-ffb9091fd47a">Part 1</a>) and/or to any other chained root of trust such as a city, state, nation, or group of&nbsp;nations.  OCs can also make verifiable any other analog identifiers in addition to or instead of the LEI. For example, a national ID, regional ID, local ID, employee ID, and any other identifiers could become cryptographically verifiable with OCs (provided their inclusion is governed by rules and safeguards similar to GLEIF’s <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/vlei/introducing-the-vlei-ecosystem-governance-framework">Ecosystem Governance Framework</a>, see&nbsp;below).  <p>When an authorized representative of an organization delegates some authority to a person or a thing, whether an employee, director, contractor, partner, customer, constituent, device or piece of software — no matter how many levels deep in the organization — OCs enable that person or thing to prove it digitally, instantly, securely, and globally. OCs are a game-changer.</p> It’s All About Authority  Delegable Authority <p>An organization is a hierarchy of delegated authority, from the very top to the very bottom. When a legal entity is founded it appeals to the state or other jurisdiction where it exists, which grants it the authority to organize itself and operate legally under applicable regulations and the rules of its founding documents. An org’s founding documents provide the rules by which founders and top executives relate to each other and which roles have which authority; all other roles and authority are delegated from&nbsp;there.</p><p>Janitors have authority to enter buildings at times or in places others cannot, and fast food workers have authority to enter the building, wear the uniform, and use the equipment. Every role within an organization, whether public or private, has some degree of authority to represent that organization, no matter how small, that can be traced back to an organization’s top representatives and founding documents. Even customers have authority to log into their accounts, enter physical or virtual venues, or have other privileges bestowed by their virtue of being a customer, with elevated privileges for highly valued customers. Contractors have authority to perform the services for which they were contracted, which sometimes include access to certain systems or facilities, and on and&nbsp;on.</p><p>It’s all some form of delegated authority.</p><p>In a business context this proof of delegated authority is essential for engaging in business transactions. This is the major difference compared to identity schemes for individuals. In a business context you need to prove that Stephan Wolf is GLEIF’s CEO; age, eye color, private address etc. are not needed, evidence that he’s the CEO is. Quite likely, OCs will become more important than an individual’s digital identity alone, at least in a business&nbsp;context.</p> Proof of Delegated Authority <p>It’s one thing to have authority, quite another to prove it. OCs enable global verification of a representative’s delegated authority — through unlimited levels of delegation — using a powerful capability of second-generation VCs: chaining.</p><p>Chaining enables multiple levels of signatures for the same credential, and also for authority to be conveyed from signature to signature and/or credential to credential, enabling the very last link in the chain of delegated authority to be as strongly provable as the&nbsp;first.</p><p>A janitor can prove his authority with a cryptographic chain of delegated authority in the OC he carries. When verified by someone (or something) he’s presented his OC to, the chain might look like&nbsp;this:</p>  the janitor got his authority to do X and Y&nbsp;from  the facilities manager, whose authority came&nbsp;from  the regional manager, whose authority came&nbsp;from  the vice president, whose authority came&nbsp;from  the president/COO, whose authority came&nbsp;from  the CEO, who was issued a vLEI credential* by  the Qualified vLEI Issuer (QVI)* that vetted the organization, who was qualified by  the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF), a global root of trust for legal entity identification.  <p>* Described below.</p><p>The authority for the janitor begins with the CEO of the organization, originating from a special root-level OC that he/she holds, and not with GLEIF or its QVI. A CEO credential received from a QVI is not a delegation of authority; it is a digitally signed, non-repudiable attestation that the holder of that credential really is the CEO, issued by an accredited QVI or other reputable issuer after a rigorous vetting process. What the CEO does with the credential from thereon has nothing to do with the fact that an external entity asserts that he/she really is the CEO, and has digitally signed that assertion so that it’s verifiable anywhere.</p> Roots of&nbsp;Trust <p>A “root of trust” is a verifiable ultimate source of credibility for an OC that gives downstream verifiers confidence that the OC was really issued by the claimed organization.</p><p>As discussed in detail in Part 1, GLEIF makes an ideal global root of trust, but they aren’t the only one and the need for verifiability isn’t always global: any organization or authority can become its own root of trust and start issuing OCs without asking permission from anyone else; OCs are all open source and open standard under the hood. For OCs to become broadly acceptable within a state or province, for example, the root of trust for those OCs must be broadly trusted in the physical world throughout that state or province, and it must publish a comprehensive governance framework for its OC issuance process. (More on governance frameworks below.)</p><p>When downstream verifiers trust the root of a chain, they can more easily trust the OC presented at the end of the chain. If a state or province becomes its own root of trust, the example from above could continue like&nbsp;this:</p>  the CEO’s authority came&nbsp;from  the board of directors, whose authority came&nbsp;from  the most recent shareholder vote, which was authorized by  the articles of incorporation as attested&nbsp;by  a legal officer of the company, whose authority came&nbsp;from  the state or provincial registry of legal organizations, which  vetted the organization and issued the credential.  <p>Of course, the world sometimes is more complex than that and not as cleanly hierarchical, and OCs allow modeling of more complicated real-world scenarios, while still emanating from a trusted root. For example, a regional manager might be the CEO of a legal entity in Country A, but also report to a vice president of the parent company which is a legal entity in Country B. In this case, the CEO of the subsidiary would have the subsidiary’s LEI in its OC, which is linked to the LEIs of the direct and ultimate parent companies (using GLEIF lingo here). Chained OCs could easily be created to reflect this special delegation of authority, with each chain easily verifiable back to a GLEIF root of&nbsp;trust.</p><p>The same chaining flexibility for OCs applies to any chosen root of&nbsp;trust.</p> Binding Flesh to&nbsp;Digital <p>OCs are like ornaments on a tree: they hang from a branch attached to a trunk grown from a root. The root-level OCs are the first ones held by the organization, the highest level of authority from which all other lesser authority is delegated.</p><p>So how does the root start? How does an organization get its first, root-level OC?</p> The First/Root-Level OC: the&nbsp;vLEI <p>Organizational Credentials (OCs) are a specific kind of Verifiable Credential (VC), and the vLEI is a specific kind of OC, the first OC held by an organization that becomes the root of all others. So, the vLEI is an OC which is a VC. The relationships between them can be represented as concentric circles:</p><p>This means that OCs are compatible with and subject to VC standards such as those from IETF, W3C, and eventually, ISO. This also means that standards-compliant apps, wallets, and administrative tools should, eventually, work with OCs. We say “should” and “eventually” because the standards efforts are well underway but not yet concluded, and even when they are, some standards-compliant VCs and tools may not support all of the capabilities mentioned here, such as delegation (it’s possible to do OCs without delegation, but clumsy), multi-sig, key recovery, and key rotation. The OCs that will always have the capabilities mentioned here utilize second-generation VCs powered by KERI and ACDC protocols, as second-generation VCs were designed from the ground up to deliver these capabilities for organizations.</p> Stop! Before Issuing a Single&nbsp;OC… <p>A tree is only as secure as its root. This is why the issuance of an organization’s first, root-level credentials must be done with utmost care, with planning, preparation, and above all, security.</p><p>The open protocols underlying OCs do not force security to be done properly, but as described above, they enable the establishment of a foundational digital security posture for the organization that would be the envy of anything currently found in Web2, Web3, Web5,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>For example, GLEIF’s Ecosystem Governance Framework (described in the next section) recommends taking full-advantage of OC’s multi-sig capabilities by establishing signing thresholds with all root-level credentials. Otherwise, lost or compromised keys or a rogue representative at the root level could be catastrophic; it would be foolish to be exposed to this risk when avoiding it is relatively simple. These thresholds can be ‘m-of-n’, such as 1-of-2, 3-of-5, and so on, with added weighting for representatives with more authority. Sole proprietors can establish multi-sig across multiple devices, as can anyone else in a signing&nbsp;group.</p><p>The actual process of issuance to the multi-sig configuration of an organization must be done carefully. When a Qualified vLEI issuer (QVI) in the GLEIF ecosystem issues a vLEI, for example, it does so within a carefully orchestrated ceremony only after the organization has been fully vetted (through the LEI issuance process). Organizational representatives must also be rigorously vetted, both for their identity and their authority; a GLEIF QVI inspects company formation and other relevant documents to ensure this. Then there’s the use of secure video and audio connections, secure messaging, secure wallets, and&nbsp;more.</p> The Key to Trusting OCs: Governance Frameworks <p>In reviewing the draft of this post, Steven Milstein, the Vice Chair of the Governance Stack Working Group at the Trust over IP Foundation, made this insightful comment:</p><p>“OI &amp; OCs are only as strong as their published Governance Framework. And that framework is only as robust as the technologies that implement it. The more significant the gap between the framework and the underlying code, the greater the risk [Verifiers and Issuers]&nbsp;assume.”</p><p>Bold words, and we agree with them. The technology underpinning OCs makes the credential verifiable, but it’s the governance framework that makes it trustworthy. The distinction is&nbsp;crucial:</p><p>Verifiable: can cryptographically verify four things: 1. who issued by; 2. who issued to (optional); 3. not tampered with; 4. not revoked or expired. As mentioned earlier, verification does NOT provide any judgment about the data payload inside the OC, whether it is true, correct, complete, or anything else, it only confirms who issued it and that it hasn’t been changed or revoked since issuance. The data inside could be gibberish… authentic gibberish.</p><p>Trustworthy: trustworthy means that you know and trust the issuer of the OC, and/or you trust the process by which the OC was issued because the process itself has been vetted to meet a standard that you trust. That process is a governance framework.</p><p>For example, the first governance framework for OI in existence, GLEIF’s <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/vlei/introducing-the-vlei-ecosystem-governance-framework">Ecosystem Governance Framework</a> (EGF), provides guidance for vLEI issuance, which takes full advantage of the security capabilities of second-generation VCs. How these steps are followed and by whom is critically important to ensure the process is thorough and has integrity, because the security of financial, legal and other transactions performed digitally by representatives of the organization will depend on its successful execution.</p><p>GLEIF itself does not perform any vetting of the legal entity or its representatives and is not involved in the vLEI issuance process, but through the EGF they develop and manage the detailed rules for how it all gets done, and ensure their QVIs are following those rules. It is GLEIF’s QVIs — who’ve been extensively vetted themselves by GLEIF and must remain qualified annually — who vet representatives and issue vLEI credentials. GLEIF is the global guardian and compliance officer of these governance frameworks.</p> OCs, Privacy, and Self-Sovereignty  Personal Privacy and Graduated Disclosure <p>With OCs the personal privacy of the holder — a representative of the organization — is of less relevance when that representative is an employee or contractor and they are acting within that context; the organization gets to decide what that representative should be disclosing or keeping private, which they can do quite powerfully with Graduated Disclosure as described below. When an OC holder is a customer or constituent, however, personal privacy becomes critically and legally important, magnifying the need for robust disclosure capabilities.</p><p>As with all ACDC VCs, OCs have three granular, legally enforceable “Graduated Disclosure” capabilities highly relevant to and needed by organizations:</p><p>Selective disclosure — the ability to provably disclose only some information without disclosing the rest, such as one’s authority but not their name, or their name but not their authority, or only one aspect of their authority such as their financial ceiling for signing purchase&nbsp;orders.</p><p>Contractually protected disclosure — when counterparties verifiably consent to the terms of disclosure prior to disclosure. The provided consent is non-repudiable, providing a path for recourse if the terms of disclosure are not&nbsp;honored.</p><p>Contingent disclosure — disclosure is possible only when certain conditions are met, such as keeping an identity encrypted and in a form of escrow for business purposes and interactions, but enabling that identity to be discoverable by law enforcement or regulators if it becomes necessary. Contingent disclosure solves tricky problems in telecommunications, for example, when the originator of a communication may not wish to be identifiable to network operators, but must become identifiable to authorities if their traffic turns out to be fraudulent or&nbsp;spam.</p> Self-Sovereignty <p>When employees or contractors are acting in representation of an organization, the org is sovereign and not the individual; there is no self-sovereignty in this situation. There is autonomy of course, as the person can choose to behave however they please regardless of rules or expectations, but not self-sovereignty. Like privacy, however, the principle changes when the representative is a customer or constituent; then the sovereignty of the OC’s holder becomes relevant. Still, the customer’s or constituent’s OC was issued by the organization and can be revoked at the organization’s discretion.</p> An OC’s Superpower: Traversing Boundaries <p>Arguably the greatest capability of OCs — and all VCs that have a sufficiently strong root of trust — is the ability to traverse boundaries of all kinds. Boundaries are the killers of identity systems, seamless interactions, and digital trust generally. OCs are ground-breaking precisely because they are boundary-breaking.</p><p>Some example digital boundaries useful to traverse:</p>  Geographical/political borders (between countries)  Organizational boundaries (between companies/organizations)  Network/software boundaries (between software and hardware networks)  Hierarchical boundaries (any level of depth within an organization)  Heterarchical boundaries (every boundary between systems that isn’t hierarchical)  Communication channels (email, messaging apps, social media, calls, texts,&nbsp;etc.)  Cyberspace-to-physical space* (physical-to-digital)  <p>In each of these cases, OCs issued within one domain can be verified as authentic in another. Choosing to accept a verified OC becomes a matter of policy, not technology. For example, many countries have a national digital ID scheme, e.g. eIDAS in Europe, BankID in the Nordics, Compass and Singpass in Singapore. These schemes are incompatible with each other; in order to accept identity credentials in a cross-border fashion, participating countries must have a bespoke bilateral agreement and build bespoke technical infrastructure for each one they choose to accept, so it doesn’t happen often, with organizations ultimately suffering the&nbsp;most.</p><p>Such is the advantage of OCs using free and open standardized underlying protocols instead of shared platforms, even when implemented on a national scale: no bespoke agreements or technical infrastructure is required, just adoption of the same underlying standard key management, issuance, and verification protocols.</p> In Conclusion <p>As we said at the beginning, OCs enable representatives of an organization to prove their authority to represent the organization outside its boundaries to anyone, anywhere, without using identity providers, blockchains, shared platforms or other intermediaries. Never before has verifiable authority been possible across all boundaries and at global scale, and the underlying protocols that enable it are open and free to use, inviting anyone and everyone to commence as they please. A great many things are about to change, in a very positive&nbsp;way.</p><p>In this Part 2 we discussed the what and the why of OCs and verifiable authority, but not the how; we didn’t get technical, leaving readers to reasonably wonder exactly how all this is even possible. In Part 3 we’ll get technical by inviting the inventor of KERI key management and ACDC verifiable credentials, Dr. Samuel Smith, to explain in as business-friendly terms as he can, how OCs accomplish the things we’ve claimed in Part&nbsp;2.</p><p>Stay tuned.</p><p>¹ See <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/crypto-isnt-decentralized-nft-bored-ape-yacht-club-buys-cryptopunks-2022-3">Crypto isn’t decentralized</a>, <a href="https://engineeringideas.substack.com/p/blockchain-is-not-decentralised">Blockchain is not decentralized</a>, and <a href="https://qz.com/2112965/web3-is-not-decentralized">Web3 is not decentralized</a></p>

  <p>In previous posts, I argued the EU’s Digital Services and Digital Markets Acts are the
<a href="https://reb00ted.org/tech/20230625-meta-why-activitypub/">most likely reason</a> why Meta is implementing
ActivityPub in its upcoming Twitter competitor “P92”, and that ActivityPub
is really <a href="https://reb00ted.org/tech/20230627-meta-activitypub-eu-digital-services-act/">the only game in town</a>
that meets Meta’s requirements for interop for “P92”, as they require protocols that
are proven to work and governed in a lawyer-vetted process by a legitimate standards
organization.</p>
<p>But if that line of reasoning is correct for for why Meta would pick ActivityPub to
meet its interoperability obligations under EU’s new rules, it is likely also
correct for all other social networking products, by Meta and others, that are required
to interop by the same new rules, notably:</p>
 
 Facebook (also Meta) 
 Instagram (also Meta) 
 Snapchat (Snap) 
 LinkedIn (Microsoft) 
 Twitter 
 and perhaps even YouTube (Google). 
 
<p>(The full list is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Services_Act#Very_large_online_platforms">here</a>
although I think the EU puts them in different markets. Update 2023-06-30: Actually, this
is the wrong list; the list of “gatekeepers” will only be established in a couple of months
under the Digital Markets Act. Chances are it’s very similar to this list of “Very large
on-line platforms”, however.)</p>
<p>Let me say this again. The product teams of all of those products are very likely
asking themselves the very same question right now that Meta asked itself: what are
we going to implement to meet our interop obligations, and when are we going to do it?</p>
<p>I believe most will arrive at the same conclusion: they will look for protocols
that can demonstrably work for these kinds of interop requirements, and that are
maintained by a well-understood standards organization. And will find that
ActivityPub is the only game in town that meets those requirements.</p>
<p>(It is possible that one or two of the organizations above come up with a “spoiler”
strategy developing or picking an alternate protocol. To make up a random example, say,
Microsoft might buy Bluesky and declare it to be its interop architecture. They would have
to turn that protocol over to a standards org, however, before its competitors would
even consider it. And that might not gain them much; sticking with ActivityPub is
simpler.)</p>
<p>(It is also possible that some of the above organization will choose to fight the EU in
court; Twitter comes to mind. I’m not a lawyer, I don’t know how likely this might
succeed; however, the EU has shown to be tenacious and unstoppably moving forward in
this direction, so I wouldn’t bet on that strategy if I were them.)</p>
<p>Which means a number of things – starting with the ActivityPub standardization process
in the W3C:</p>
 
 
<p>Meta, Microsoft and others will suddenly show up in the W3C ActivityPub community. It’s
easy for them to do, they already have been spending significant amounts of time
in the W3C.</p>
 
 
<p>They will show up with requirements currently considered out of scope by the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/cg/socialcg/">W3C SWICG</a>, but driven by the need that the
entire stack is standardized that is necessary to enable interop between, say LinkedIn
and Facebook. If they decide that real interop is actually necessary – my premise –
then an “assembly required” standard (like ActivityPub is today) is not sufficient for
them.</p>
 
 
<p>Therefore the official <a href="https://www.w3.org/Social/WG">Social Web Working Group</a> will
need to be re-constituted, and its charter will need to be broader than it was before.</p>
 
 
<p>There will be loud screaming in the existing W3C social community. (Because many of the
members of the current SWIGC are extremely strongly in opposed to surveillance capitalism
– the prevailing business model of most of the companies above – or, in some cases,
that any kind of business has any role in desirable forms of social media at all.)
An accommodation will have to be found, as the W3C as an organization wants to
serve all willing participants in a standards process, not just those with a
certain value system.</p>
 
 
<p>But there more intriguing, and exciting possibility is this:</p>
 
 When everything is said and done and my line of reasoning is reasonably correct,
interoperability via ActivityPub indeed might be “everywhere”: Facebook, Instagram,
P92, LinkedIn, Snapchat, even Twitter. 
 
<p>Social media would end up being a radically different beast. A potentially much better,
beast as I believe. Ponder this.</p>
<p>Updated 2023-06-30:</p>
 
 Added Digital Markets Act in addition to the Digital Services Act; it’s really both
and the intent behind them that drive this.

<p>I started this blog in August 2007 after the host for my original blog went away. (That blog has been preserved, however. Find it at <a href="http://weblog.searls.com">http://weblog.searls.com</a>.)</p>
<p>At the time I was told something like “Hey, Harvard has been around since 1636, so your blog will last a long time here.” Well, the duration will be a bit less than sixteen years: Harvard is shutting the server down on Friday. [Later: it didn’t.]</p>
<p>I just got this news&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/blog/2023/03/02/blogs-harvard-edu-shutting-down/">here</a>, in an announcement posted in March. I missed it until Rogers Cadenhead (<a href="https://twitter.com/rcade">@rcade</a>) told me about it on Twitter. [Later: the announcement was put in an obvious place: in the blog’s dashboard header. I still missed it. Disclosure: sometimes the obvious is not apparent to me.]</p>
<p>So I am scrambling now, with the help of friends, to move the contents of this blog to a new place. Hopefully, that will be <a href="https://blog.searls.com">blog.searls.com</a> or <a href="https://searls.com/blog">searls.com/blog</a> or both. We’ll see. [Later: it landed here at doc.searls.com, which had been a redirect URL aimed for many years at <a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/doc">blogs.harvard.edu/doc</a>.]</p>
<p>Two other blogs I run—<a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/vrm">ProjectVRM</a> and <a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/trunk">Trunkline</a>—also need to be moved. ProjectVRM is the one that matters more. If all goes according to plan, <a href="http://projectvrm.org">projectvrm.org</a> will map to the same blog in its own new place. Trunkline will go to trunkli.org. [Later: both of these are (as of early July 2023) in the midst of both staying where they are and moving elsewhere. ProjectVRM should appear at some point at projectvrm.org.]</p>
<p>Here are my final Harvard-hosted posts on ProjectVRM and Trunkline:</p>
 
 <a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/vrm/2023/06/27/different/">Now it’s time for something incompletely different</a> 
 <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/trunk/2023/06/27/its-all-provisional/">It’s all provisional</a> 
 
<p>My thanks to the <a href="http://cyber.harvard.edu">Berkman Klein Center</a> for hosting these blogs for so many years, and for the amazing community it serves— and in which I remain a devoted member.</p>
 
<p>The <a href="http://Berkman%20Klein%20Center">image</a> above is of a truck I borrowed being towed away after the engine blew up in King City, California, back in 2005. It’s not a good illustration of what’s going on, but the best I could do in a hurry. I’ll find a better one later.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“We assess it as very likely that within a year or two, Meta’s social networking products
will need to interoperate with social networks from other vendors, such as Twitter,

need to interoperate with other social networks if we don’t want to leave the entire

and there are no viable legal options to avoid doing this, if you were the Meta executive
team, what would you do?</p>
<p>I think there are two key questions:</p>
 
 What exactly are you going to implement? 
 When are you going to implement it in which product? 
 
<p>Let’s start with the second question. Whatever you end up doing, it’s novel: nobody
has ever federated social networking products at the billion+ user population level.
And so nobody has any experience what kinds of problems might occur – whether technical,
moderation-wise, protocol governance, fixing interop problems by collaborating with
your competitors, cross-jurisdiction issues if content seeps from another social network
that’s banned there etc etc. Nobody even knows what the list of potential problems even
could be. So even if you are not trying to drag your feet, you will want to
start small, and gain some experience how to do this, before scaling up to billions
of users. I think even the most zealous regulator will probably accept that a gradual
approach is warranted.</p>
<p>But: your existing social networking products, notably Facebook and Instagram, have
billions of users. It’s not obvious how you can start small and not confuse the heck
out of everybody. Works only in the EU? What if people travel or move? And the EU
with its almost half a billion people is too large anyway as an initial user population.</p>
<p>As luck has it, you also just decided you were going to compete with Twitter. With
a completely new product which currently has a user population of … zero! And given
you haven’t really built it yet, you can architect it from the get-go to be
interop friendly. Much easier than to refactor Instagram at the billion user scale.
So why not start there?</p>
<p>Back to the other question: what exactly are you going to implement? Let’s assume the
lawyers have also advised to you that mere lip service is not going to be good enough,
the interop actually needs to work, work well, and be a reliable, supported feature,
for many years to come.</p>
<p>It also needs to work not just with one competitor, like, say, Twitter, but at least
a half dozen of them, and new ones show up from time to time you will need to interop with,
too. So bilateral deals won’t work, and it needs to be based on an industry standard;
either one that exists already or that is to be created. And that industry standard
needs to be maintained by some standards organization that you understand, that does not
give any one vendor outside influence, one whose process you have vetted and perhaps
have experience with.</p>
<p>Enter ActivityPub. It seems to work, at least at the million-user level. And it’s
the only social networking interop standard around that has been created by a bona-fide
standards organizations, the W3C. None of the other protocols – like Bluesky, Nostr
etc – meet those requirements; ActivityPub is really the only (existing) game in town
for what you need.</p>
<p>Ergo: you end up with ActivityPub in your upcoming Twitter competitor, pretty much from
the very beginning. Which is the most plausible reason I found
<a>in a previous post</a> why Meta might do this
completely out-of-character thing and implement ActivityPub in its new “P92” product.</p>
<p>Updated 2023-06-30:</p>
 
 Added Digital Markets Act in addition to the Digital Services Act; it’s really both. 
 Feedback from the Fediverse correctly points out that so far, only interop requirements
for messaging services (“Whatsapp” etc) are prescribed in detail (in the Digital Markets
Act). However, IMHO that misses the larger picture: I read the aim of the text of the
acts as applying to all “commonly used digital services  that mostly directly intermediate
between business users and end users” and “where concerns about weak contestability and
unfair practices by gatekeepers are more apparent and pressing from an internal market
perspective” which arguably applies more to social networking than messaging services.
Also, Twitter-like services are very much also used as direct messaging services
as well.

<p>Last night Jason and I streamed a four-hour discussion. Our focus was the intersection of Dave Snowden’s work on complex adaptive systems with Patrick Ryan’s ideas about manipulating psychological grammar fields using digital media, ChatGPT, and large language models. Ryan details how our linguistic “home bases,” mathematical representations of our “souls” and interior states, can be charted over time to steer our behavior through online social interactions. The backdrop of this conversation was the recent news that my husband wants a divorce, even as I remain (at their request) estranged from my young adult child, and my mother can’t understand or support what she views as my “hobby” of wanting to get clarity on what is happening to us and our humanity. I’m taking it in stride. The fact that I have come to understand the mechanics of worldview manipulation help me not take these fractures and misunderstandings of my being too personally. Most people are looking through a glass darkly as I work to rub off the fog.</p>

  <p>Meta has gradually <a href="https://snarfed.org/2018-08-03_rip-facebook-for-bridgy">locked down</a>
all of its apps. Now they are coming out with a
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/8/23754304/instagram-meta-twitter-competitor-threads-activitypub">Twitter competitor</a>
that, according to all reports, will have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub">ActivityPub</a>
standards support. This promises to make it interoperable with other social networking apps
like Mastodon in the broader <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse">Fediverse</a> decentralized
social network.</p>
<p>The Fediverse is in uproar, debating fiercely how to react to it, with a
<a href="https://fedipact.online/">sizable group</a> of operators already promising to block
them out of the gate, mostly on the grounds that Meta is the personification of everything
that the Fediverse is against: tracking, surveillance, manipulation, advertising.</p>
<p>But why would Meta support ActivityPub in the first place? It is
completely out of character for them. I would suggest that only if we understand
Meta’s goals with ActivityPub support can we make a rational assessment what, if
anything, we should do to react.</p>
<p>First, let’s dispense with this first commonly cited reason why they do this. It does
not pass muster.</p>
<p>1. Meta wishes to leverage today’s Fediverse to get started, and then embrace and
extinguish it.</p>
<p>No, it does not. Two good arguments:</p>
 
 
<p>Numbers: Alex Heath is <a href="https://mastodon.social/@alexeheath/110596226686316769">reporting</a>
that “Meta is hoping for at least tens of millions of users within the first few
months of availability”. The Fediverse currently has between 1 and 2 million active monthly
users. So Meta is expecting at least 10x of those numbers by the end of the year.</p>
<p>(If you think of it, of course they want those kinds of numbers. Both Facebook and
Instagram have far more than a billion users each. Why would they build another app if
they didn’t think they would get at least 100 million users?)</p>
<p>Embrace and extend is an entirely ineffective strategy if what you want to embrace and
extend has only a tenth of the users you want “in just a few months”. It is not worth
to embark on such a complex strategy if it only works for a month or two at best.</p>
 
 
<p>Would you really go to market focused on an initial customer segment that contains all
the people – and perhaps only those people – most actively hostile to you as a company?</p>
 
 
<p>Verdict: NO.</p>
<p>Let’s move on to a more likely reason:</p>
<p>2. Meta observed that Elon cut off many third-party apps from Twitter, and wants to
attract those third-party developers to the new app so the new app can more effectively
compete with Twitter.</p>
<p>This is a more compelling reason. Building an ecosystem of complementary apps and
services is a tried-and-true, successful strategy to compete against a product that
does not have them. And which just burned its bridges with the developer community
by cutting them off out of the blue.</p>
<p>However: if that was goal, why would they implement standardized ActivityPub, as opposed
to simply creating a (proprietary) API, like Meta has for its other products? It’s not
like the cut-off Twitter app developers will require a standard API to come to Meta:
not losing their business is good enough for them. Also, implementing a standard
protocol comes with substantial costs and risks to Meta, including its inability to
change it on a whim when Meta’s business circumstances should change.</p>
<p>Verdict: INSUFFICIENT as an explanation.</p>
<p>3. The European Union is coming down hard on Meta, demanding all sorts of interoperability
as part of its Digital Services and Digital Market Acts. By implementing a bona-fide W3C
interoperability standard as part of a new app, Meta can signal both cooperation with the
EU authorities, while delaying opening its core business as long as possible.</p>
<p>In the US, we tend to ignore changes in European law. We also seem to consider it
inconceivable that any meaningful jurisdiction would actually pass the kinds of laws
that they have been passing left and right. But they have, and the EU commission is not
kidding with enforcement either. While Meta may decide to
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/22/23770620/meta-news-facebook-instagram-canada-online-news-act">leave Canada</a>
to not have to comply with certain Canadian laws, they cannot afford to leave an affluent,
almost <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_single_market">half-billion people</a> market.</p>
<p>I’m sure Meta is embarking on a multi-pronged strategy to resist, including lobbying,
lawsuits, dragging their feet, and all sorts of other things. This multi-pronged strategy
probably also means they have to throw the regulators a bone, on occasion. What better than to
do this with a new product where there is no downside to an existing business, because
there is no existing business? And if that helps with improving brand image – which it
does – and appeal to 3rd-party developers, which the incumbent just turned against
themselves, why not?</p>
<p>Verdict: MOST PLAUSIBLE.</p>
<p>If this analysis is more or less correct, this has consequences both for what Meta will
doing going forward, and what today’s Fediverse should do to prepare and react.

 Once upon a time, there was a powerful landlord who owned much of the land. He had

<p>Once upon a time, there was a powerful landlord who owned much of the land. He had
lots of serfs working on that land. While the landlord was an absolute monarch and
profited from the work of the serfs more than he otherwise would have,  both landlord
and tenants were mostly happy with the arrangement.</p>
 
Reddit had lots of users, merrily posting links and having discussions. Reddit would
monetize this through ads.
 
<p>Then one day, the landlord decided to raise taxes. He didn’t talk to his serfs
first. He, just one day, out of the blue, announced that there would be taxes, and
specifically taxes on the tools that the serfs were using to make themselves more
productive.</p>
 
Reddit suddenly announced high charges for their API, making many external tools
financially non-viable.
 
<p>Not only were the unexpected taxes high, they were so high that it made it effectively
impossible for the serfs to continue using those tools, thereby reducing productivity
and happiness of the serfs.</p>
 
This made it effectively impossible for Reddit moderators to use external moderation tools
and users could no longer use 3rd-party clients.
 
<p>Guess what happened next?</p>
<p>Surprising absolutely nobody, the serfs – well, some of them – revolted. Some stopped
farming their fields. Some closed their markets and stores. Some planted signs all
over the land with directions to other lands not controlled by this landlord, suggesting
that everybody pack up and leave the lord’s land. Some ingenious serfs even started
mislabeling their produce, calling it “not safe”, thereby striking directly at the
revenue stream of the landlord.</p>
 
Some Reddit moderators took their subreddits private. Some directed their users over
into the Fediverse to <a href="https://join-lemmy.org/">Lemmy</a> and
<a href="https://kbin.pub/en">/kbin</a>. And some other labeled their subreddits
"not safe for work", striking directly at Reddit's advertising revenue
as fewer advertisers want to be seen in that context.
 
<p>So the landlord struck back. He fired foremen and village elders, inviting less scrupulous
others to take over their place. He forced stores to open again, and sent his goons to remove the “not safe” stickers.</p>
 
Reporedly some moderators were forcibly removed by Reddit, subreddits re-opened and
NSFW labels forcibly removed.
 
<p>I’m writing this in political terms, because the analogy is just so incredibly striking.</p>
<p>By that analogy, we all know history and what might come next. As in history, the
short-term outcome is uncertain. The longer-term trends, however, are clear.</p>

<p>As organizations and customers navigate the ever-increasing landscape of fraud and cybersecurity threats, the need for trust becomes paramount. In a recent webinar exploring these challenges, I, along with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/surashpatel/">Surash Patel</a> from <a href="https://www.telesign.com/">TeleSign</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-bruner-3a73018/">John Bruner</a> from <a href="https://aegismobile.com/">Aegis Mobile</a>, help shed light on the significance of establishing trust and the responsibility brands bear in protecting their consumers. Drawing from the 2023 Telesign Trust Index and industry initiatives, this article delves into consumer expectations, the impact of trust on businesses, and evolving strategies to foster trust in the digital economy.</p>
<p></p>
 Consumer Expectations and the Power of Trust 
<p>According to the 2023 Telesign Trust Index, which surveyed consumers, an overwhelming 94% believe that businesses hold the responsibility for safeguarding their privacy. Moreover, consumers are more likely to engage and transact with brands they trust. Deloitte research reveals that trusted brands enjoy a 25% increase in consumer spending. Therefore, the correlation between trust, customer loyalty, and financial success cannot be ignored.</p>
 Challenges in a Digital Landscape 
<p>In a world of increasing digital sophistication, distinguishing between good and bad actors, as well as authentic messages from fraudulent ones, poses significant challenges. The rise of fraud and data breaches has highlighted the vulnerability of consumers and the potential damage to a brand’s reputation. A staggering 43% of consumers reported severing ties with a brand following a data breach, with many publicly sharing their negative experiences on social media.</p>
 The Need for Continuous Verification 
<p>In response to these challenges, the traditional notion of “trust, then verify” is evolving into “always verify, and then trust.” Data privacy and security are critical, necessitating proactive measures to protect consumers. Brands must adopt appropriate strategies to instill confidence in their customer base.</p>
 Telesign Continuous Trust™ Authority: Building a Safer Digital World 
<p>In addition to unveiling the Telesign Trust Index, <a href="https://www.telesign.com/">Telesign</a> has launched the Telesign Continuous Trust™ Authority initiative. This industry-wide effort aims to collaborate with various stakeholders in the digital economy to reduce fraud and maintain trust. By aligning industry and government initiatives, companies can establish systemic trust and shape future policies.</p>
 Steps to Protect Brands, Consumers, and the Industry 
<p>During the webinar, we explored several actions that brands can take to enhance trust and secure their relationships with consumers. One such measure is mobile phone intelligence and phone number risk scoring. <a href="https://www.telesign.com/">Telesign</a> assists brands in assessing the risk associated with consumer engagements across different stages of the customer journey, enabling informed decision-making in real-time.</p>
<p>Mobile phone risk scoring assigns a score from 1 to 1,000 based on various factors, including SIM swapping signals. By leveraging this scoring system and other available data, brands can determine the trustworthiness of mobile phone numbers involved in transactions or critical touchpoints. Regular checks can be conducted throughout the customer lifecycle to mitigate potential harm and fraud.</p>
 Protecting Brands through Organizational Risk Scoring and Messaging 
<p>Complementing mobile phone risk scoring, <a href="https://aegismobile.com/">Aegis Mobile</a> collaborates with U.S. mobile operators and The Campaign Registry (TCR) to evaluate brand legitimacy before approving 10 DLC (ten-digit long code) text messaging traffic. <a href="https://aegismobile.com/">Aegis Mobile</a>‘s automated vetting process quickly verifies a brand’s legal standing, ensuring that bad actors are kept at bay and consumers are protected.</p>
 Preparing for a Future of Systemic Trust 
<p>Looking ahead, the concept of systemic trust emerges as a promising solution. By cryptographically signing every message and interaction between organizations and individuals, accountability is established. This approach enables both brands and consumers to hold each other responsible for their actions, all while preserving dignity, privacy, and security. The advent of personal and organizational identity is on the horizon, paving the way for verifiable claims and enhanced trust in digital interactions.</p>
 Conclusion: Embracing Trust in a Changing Landscape 
<p>As the digital landscape evolves, brands must prioritize trust-building initiatives to protect their consumers and reputation. The initiatives discussed in this article provide a starting point, and it is crucial for brands to adopt and roll out similar programs. The journey towards a new business metric, focused on verified connections and cryptographic assertions, may take time. However, by prioritizing trust and implementing proactive measures, brands can navigate the challenges of the digital age and build enduring relationships with their customers.</p>

<p>Tonight, I’d like to tell you of my encounter with a tree. It was a middle-age oak of stout girth (kind of like me), not yet majestic. It kept company with a slender pine in the median of a commercial parking lot in Bucks County about an hour outside Philadelphia. On the opposite side of the median was a vacant pavement belonging to a dead hotel. As I turned left into the office park, I noticed “No Trespassing” barriers blocking the drive, which was disconcerting. I steered my old Subaru passed some nondescript office suites that dated to the 1980s. I was twenty minutes early for my appointment. I’d planned for extra travel time. Normally I would have taken I-95 to get there, but extraordinary circumstances led a huge section of the interstate to collapse a few weeks ago, and all the traffic through the region was being re-routed onto back roads.</p>
<p></p>
<p>What led to this tree-hugging encounter? That would be a bombshell conversation I had with my spouse of twenty-nine years a little less than two weeks ago. I’d just gotten home after caring for my mother in South Carolina for ten days. I was working on quilting her 80th birthday gift – a lovely blue quilt top that reminds me of the ocean. I paused when my husband arrived home early from an office outing to tell me that he’d been unfaithful to me for two years with a nurse and wanted a divorce. We’d been together since 1989 when we fell in love in Venice during a study abroad program. Our “dorm” had been an old warehouse on the Grand Canal next to the Peggy Guggenheim Museum. We grew up together, and then grew apart, though I was a bit late to clue into that part. It was during the lockdowns that he decided we were irreconcilable, and downloaded a dating app to see what other options may be out there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’d been cancelled again – first my job, then my child, then my life partner. Even my mother, upon hearing the news, implied I brought this on myself due to what she calls “my hobby.” Having a curious mind prone to independent thinking seems to be profoundly unsettling for large swaths of society that promote diversity and equity and inclusion while somehow also embracing rigidity and intolerance. Thirteen days ago, I found myself a pruned node, socially excluded for my refusal to be a midwife to an emergent bio-hybrid super-intelligence. There are those who embrace consensus, and there are those who are outliers. In my twenties I was firmly ensconced in a consensus mindset, but in my fifties, I found myself a middle-aged wildcard having flipped roles as a renegade with my former punk-rock college DJ love now transformed into a highly competent administrator overseeing the education of future leaders for the “what works” Web3 cybernetic future.</p>
<p>My friend Deepti connected me with a wonderful Vedic astrologer last fall, so I decided to check in to get her take on what had happened. As Cliff would say, “something’s happening, nothing’s wrong.” Mohita told me that I would find a way to make money doing work around values and culture in service to society. If anyone has ideas for a mouthy woman of a certain age, I’m all ears. Do I have to get a LinkedIn profile now? Mohita went on to say I would be very creative far from home and that it was time to integrate all of the Alisons and bring them along into this new phase of life that begins next year.</p>
<p>For the short term I’ll be landing in the Pacific Northwest to help a friend who runs a small landscape company. It will be lovely to be outdoors and be more in my body and a bit less in my head. So, I am going to be working on that for a bit. I have to revisit my relationship with these technologies that are hijacking consciousness and stigmergically steering us into neutralized silos. It may be quiet on my blog and channel until winter. I feel called to reconnect with nature: moss, fungi, boulders, and rain. There will likely be a cross-country trip in my future, so if you live in the swath of country between Philadelphia and Seattle and have a couch or a yard to camp in in September, shoot me an email (timpsila@protonmail.com). I’d love to meet more of my readers in person.</p>
<p>I have forgiven my husband for his mistake – not in seeking happiness, but in the way he went about it. The course of my life was changed by an app – a dating app (see this 2018 short story, <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/04/25/143469/unchained-a-story-of-love-loss-and-blockchain/">Unchained: A Story of Love, Loss, and Blockchain</a>, from MIT Technology Review for perspective). But that may not be a bad thing, only different. I have been given a unique set of eyes, a quirky mind, and an open heart. I’m meant to do something with my time on the planet that only an outlier can do. I’m holding this unfolding episode of my life as an unexpected invitation, not a tragedy. I love my family. My moon is in the first house and a cozy home full of love is in the cards. I am confident we can be a family in a new way. I just need to be patient. For now, I dream of a future where I can support the creation of a haven for people like me to think and create and connect. From tiny acorns, mighty oaks grow.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When I arrived early to my appointment with the divorce lawyer, I didn’t want to wait in the lobby or sit in my car. So, I got out and gave that oak a big hug and looked for acorns. There was a green one on a low branch and I popped it into the coin purse of my wallet to remember this day, a beckoning open door. I walked around and sat on the far side of the tree where I noticed teeny-tiny acorns on the pavement. Because the hotel was vacant, there had been no cars in that lot for a long, long time – no tires to crush the nuts into bits. It was a haven for acorns. Who knew that oaks dropped them in the spring, too? I didn’t.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I picked a few up and started to place them one next to the other, creating a heart. Then I paused and decided to gather up a bunch of them. In a few minutes I had a large handful, so many that I didn’t need to be stingy with the outline. I poured them onto the pavement and shaped them into the universal symbol of love and in the center, I placed three leaves with a beautiful, variegated hue to represent our family and said a prayer for healing and open paths for all of us. It seemed strange to drive an hour outside the city to meet with this lawyer on the recommendation of a friend, especially given the I-95 situation, but I’m accepting opportunities as they present themselves. In this case, I think I was fated to “meet” this tree.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>My first instinct upon hearing the news, beyond wanting to figure out a way to maintain our family, was fear over the future, of being alone in an uncertain economy with skills that are not valued in a digital society. I was in a scarcity mindset, which gradually eased as friends stepped up in support of me. Not yet two weeks out, I’m practicing being without a firm plan and embracing a future where abundance is possible. The oak and the handfuls of little acorns were a message for me, that it will be ok – different, but ok. Mohita says we come into this world with all that we need, the challenge is to learn the lessons. She sees people as signals that tell us something about the state of the sacred fabric of the universe from which we emerge. I love that idea.</p>
<p>A few years ago a friend gave me a silver ring with dandelions on it and the inscription “this too shall pass.” I pointed it out to my mother during our recent visit. I didn’t realize what a blessing it would be to have that ring on my hand even as my wedding ring unexpectedly became obsolete. I hold no ill will for my husband because I know more and more each day how cognitive domain management happens, so please no unkind comments. I know that the system employs sophisticated measures to geo-fence and isolate disruptive elements. I also know that I would never be able to successfully forget what I know and go back to the fold. So, I embrace this new chapter with the support and blessings of friends who can see me and cherish me for who I am.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I hope this is not too personal, but I’ve always been pretty open about my life. Who I am shapes the stories I tell and how I tell them. Who knows what will come next? I’m leaving the window open with a prayer for guidance. I’m told it will come.</p>

<p>This article shows how an administrator can reset passwords for local members of an Azure AD tenant using Microsoft Graph and delegated permissions. An ASP.NET Core application is used to implement the Azure AD client and the Graph client services.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/azuerad-reset">https://github.com/damienbod/azuerad-reset</a></p>



 Setup Azure App registration 



<p>The Azure App registration is setup to authenticate with a user and an application (delegated flow). An App registration “Web” setup is used. Only delegated permissions are used in this setup. This implements an OpenID Connect code flow with PKCE and a confidential client. A secret or a certificate is required for this flow.</p>



<p>The following delegated Graph permissions are used:</p>



 
 Directory.AccessAsUser.All 



 User.ReadWrite.All 



 UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite.All  
 



 ASP.NET Core setup 



<p>The ASP.NET Core application implements the Azure AD client using the Microsoft.Identity.Web Nuget package and libraries. The following packages are used:</p>



 
 Microsoft.Identity.Web 



 Microsoft.Identity.Web.UI
 
 Microsoft.Identity.Web.GraphServiceClient (SDK5)  



 or  



 Microsoft.Identity.Web.MicrosoftGraph (SDK4) 
 
 
 



<p>Microsoft Graph is not added directly because the Microsoft.Identity.Web.MicrosoftGraph or Microsoft.Identity.Web.GraphServiceClient adds this with a tested and working version. Microsoft.Identity.Web uses the Microsoft.Identity.Web.GraphServiceClient package for Graph SDK 5. Microsoft.Identity.Web.MicrosoftGraph uses Microsoft.Graph 4.x versions. The official Microsoft Graph documentation is already updated to SDK 5. For application permissions, Microsoft Graph SDK 5 can be used with Azure.Identity. </p>



 Search for users with Graph SDK 5 and resetting the password 



<p>The Graph SDK 5 can be used to search for users and reset the user using a delegated scope and then to reset the password using the Patch HTTP request. The Graph QueryParameters are used to find the user and the HTTP Patch is used to update the password using the PasswordProfile.</p>


  using System.Security.Cryptography;
using Microsoft.Graph;
using Microsoft.Graph.Models;

namespace AzureAdPasswordReset;

public class UserResetPasswordDelegatedGraphSDK5
{
    private readonly GraphServiceClient _graphServiceClient;

    public UserResetPasswordDelegatedGraphSDK5(GraphServiceClient graphServiceClient)
    {
        _graphServiceClient = graphServiceClient;
    }

    /// &lt;summary&gt;
    /// Directory.AccessAsUser.All User.ReadWrite.All UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite.All
    /// &lt;/summary&gt;
    public async Task&lt;(string? Upn, string? Password)&gt; ResetPassword(string oid)
    {
        var password = GetRandomString();

        var user = await _graphServiceClient
            .Users[oid]
            .GetAsync();

        if (user == null)
        {
            throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(oid));
        }

        await _graphServiceClient.Users[oid].PatchAsync(
            new User
            {
                PasswordProfile = new PasswordProfile
                {
                    Password = password,
                    ForceChangePasswordNextSignIn = true
                }
            });

        return (user.UserPrincipalName, password);
    }

    public async Task&lt;UserCollectionResponse?&gt; FindUsers(string search)
    {
        var result = await _graphServiceClient.Users.GetAsync((requestConfiguration) =&gt;
        {
            requestConfiguration.QueryParameters.Top = 10;
            if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(search))
            {
                requestConfiguration.QueryParameters.Search = $"\"displayName:{search}\"";
            }
            requestConfiguration.QueryParameters.Orderby = new string[] { "displayName" };
            requestConfiguration.QueryParameters.Count = true;
            requestConfiguration.QueryParameters.Select = new string[] { "id", "displayName", "userPrincipalName", "userType" };
            requestConfiguration.QueryParameters.Filter = "userType eq 'Member'"; // onPremisesSyncEnabled eq false
            requestConfiguration.Headers.Add("ConsistencyLevel", "eventual");
        });

        return result;
    }

    private static string GetRandomString()
    {
        var random = $"{GenerateRandom()}{GenerateRandom()}{GenerateRandom()}{GenerateRandom()}-AC";
        return random;
    }

    private static int GenerateRandom()
    {
        return RandomNumberGenerator.GetInt32(100000000, int.MaxValue);
    }
}
  


<p></p>



 Search for users SDK 4 



<p>The application allows the user administration to search for members of the Azure AD tenant and finds users using a select and a filter definition. The search query parameter would probably return a better user experience.</p>


  public async Task&lt;IGraphServiceUsersCollectionPage?&gt; 
	FindUsers(string search)
{
	var users = await _graphServiceClient.Users.Request()
		.Filter($"startswith(displayName,'{search}') AND userType eq 'Member'")
		.Select(u =&gt; new
		{
			u.Id,
			u.GivenName,
			u.Surname,
			u.DisplayName,
			u.Mail,
			u.EmployeeId,
			u.EmployeeType,
			u.BusinessPhones,
			u.MobilePhone,
			u.AccountEnabled,
			u.UserPrincipalName
		})
		.GetAsync();

	return users;
}
  


<p></p>



<p>The ASP.NET Core Razor page supports an auto complete using the OnGetAutoCompleteSuggest method. This returns the found results using the Graph request.</p>


  private readonly UserResetPasswordDelegatedGraphSDK4 _graphUsers;
public string? SearchText { get; set; }

public IndexModel(UserResetPasswordDelegatedGraphSDK4 graphUsers)
{
	_graphUsers = graphUsers;
}

public async Task&lt;ActionResult&gt; OnGetAutoCompleteSuggest(string term)
{
	if (term == "*") term = string.Empty;

	var usersCollectionResponse = await _graphUsers.FindUsers(term);

	var users = usersCollectionResponse!.ToList();

	var usersDisplay = users.Select(user =&gt; new
	{
		user.Id,
		user.UserPrincipalName,
		user.DisplayName
	});

	SearchText = term;

	return new JsonResult(usersDisplay);
}
  


<p></p>



<p>The Razor Page can be implemented using Bootstrap or whatever CSS framework you prefer.</p>







<p></p>



 Reset the password for user X using Graph SDK 4 



<p>The Graph service supports reset a password using a delegated permission. The user is requested using the OID and a new PasswordProfile is created updating the password and forcing a one time usage. </p>


  /// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Directory.AccessAsUser.All 
/// User.ReadWrite.All 
/// UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite.All
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
public async Task&lt;(string? Upn, string? Password)&gt; 
	ResetPassword(string oid)
{
	var password = GetRandomString();

	var user = await _graphServiceClient.Users[oid]
		.Request().GetAsync();

	if (user == null)
	{
		throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(oid));
	}

	await _graphServiceClient.Users[oid].Request()
		.UpdateAsync(new User
		{
			PasswordProfile = new PasswordProfile
			{
				Password = password,
				ForceChangePasswordNextSignIn = true
			}
		});

	return (user.UserPrincipalName, password);
}
  


<p>The Razor Page sends a post request and resets the password using the user principal name.</p>


  public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; OnPostAsync()
{
	var id = Request.Form
		.FirstOrDefault(u =&gt; u.Key == "userId")
		.Value.FirstOrDefault();
	var upn = Request.Form
		.FirstOrDefault(u =&gt; u.Key == "userPrincipalName")
		.Value.FirstOrDefault();

	if(!string.IsNullOrEmpty(id))
	{
		var result = await _graphUsers.ResetPassword(id);
		Upn = result.Upn;
		Password = result.Password;
		return Page();
	}

	return Page();
}
  


<p></p>



 Running the application 



<p>When the application is started, a user password can be reset and updated. It is important to block this function for non-authorized users as it is possible to reset any account without further protection. You could PIM this application using an azure AD security group or something like this.</p>







<p></p>



 Notes 



<p>Using Graph SDK 4 is hard as almost no docs now exist, Graph has moved to version 5. Microsoft Graph SDK 5 has many breaking changes and is supported by Microsoft.Identity.Web using the Microsoft.Identity.Web.GraphServiceClient package.</p>



<p>High user permissions are used in this and it is important to protection this API or the users that can use the application.</p>

<p>
Last week I had to convert a table in a Google Doc to a JSON structure that will render as an HTML page. This is the sort of mundane task that burns staggering amounts of information workers’ time, effort, and attention. Until recently there were two ways to do it. For most, it’s a mind-numbing manual exercise. For some (like me) it can sometimes be possible to write a script to do the transformation, but that’s another mind-numbing exercise, and it’s always tough to decide in advance whether the time and effort saved will be worth the trouble.</p>
<p>
Tabular data is famously complex. Recently, I wrote a Steampipe plugin to find tables in web pages and transform them into Postgres tables. Then, naively, I tried to do the same for PDF files. It had been a while since I used any of the available libraries for parsing PDFs. Last time it hadn’t gone well,  I thought maybe things had improved since, but no, it remains an unsolved problem. Which is tragic for many reasons, not least that the corpus of scientific knowledge lives in PDF files, and the tabular info they contain remains unavailable to machine processing. That’s not just my opinion. I consulted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Murray-Rust">Peter Murray-Rust</a>, who has spent decades working on this problem, and he confirmed that as yet there’s no general solution.</p>
 An eye-opening outcome 
<p>
So you can imagine my surprise and delight when ChatGPT-4 accomplished the task. As usual, I first tried the Simplest Thing That Could Possibly Work. Rather than exporting the GDoc to one of the available formats, I just copied from the screen, pasted into the chat, and asked for a Markdown table. What you get, when you paste a copied GDoc table, is completely unformatted: one item per line, with no indication of what’s a table header, or a section header, or a normal row. There’s no apparent structure at all. And yet the tool was able to find the structure in that undifferentiated stream of items, and faithfully recreate the table. </p>
<p>
I then presented an example of the JSON format, and asked for a transformation of the Markdown table to that format. It was a big table with a dozen sections, each with a handful of rows, and that didn’t go well. What I’m learning, though, is that the same strategy we use as programmers — decompose big tasks into smaller chunks — works well with LLMs. That’s why I opted for Markdown as an intermediate format, instead of asking to transform the raw data directly to the target JSON format. </p>
<p>
The next part was especially interesting. I asked for a list of the section names, which it reported correctly. Then I asked to translate each section, by name, to the target format. That worked. It still required a dozen manual steps, because I had to append each generated JSON chunk to the final output, but that took a fraction of the time and effort that would otherwise be required.</p>
<p>
We are on the cusp of a new era of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_Surplus">cognitive surplus</a>. People shouldn’t be laboriously transposing document formats, as millions (maybe billions) of information workers spend minutes (maybe hours) doing every day. These are tedious chores; it’s impossible to overstate how taxing they are, or what a relief it is to outsource them to the machine. That said…</p>
 A few caveats 
<p>Beginner’s luck?: I was unable to reproduce the behavior exactly as described here. This seems typical so far with LLMs, and I sometimes wonder if some of the best outcomes are just beginner’s luck. But actually, I think it may have more to do with interaction boundaries. In ChatGPT (and friends), New Chat (or equivalent) doesn’t seem to reset in a way that enables me to reproduce a result. Maybe there is no way? </p>
<p>Context window: I tried prompting with docx and html exports of the GDoc, but they were too large. My guess is that more context headroom wouldn’t necessarily have enabled me to do the whole job in one go, versus multiple interactions, because the path from bigger prompt to a desired transformation becomes less likely to be followed. Again, who knows? We’re in a realm of experimention that’s full of such unknowns.</p>
<p>Verification: My first rule for effective use of an LLM to perform some well-defined task has been: It’s quick and easy to verify the result. Right away, simple bash and Python scripts met that criterion. A script that combines a bunch of isomorphic CSV files into one big file, while deduplicating the headers, either works or it doesn’t. That’s easy to verify. And it’s quick, too, even if you wind up iterating a few times. The table transformation described here falls into the same category. It did require a proofread, and I made a couple of tiny tweaks, but verification was quick and easy. Had it been 10x larger, though, the burden of verification would suck some of the value out of the LLM solution.</p>
<p>Other LLMs: None of the others did well on this task. I expect they’ll all improve, though, and as they do, it’ll become more and more feasible to ask for multiple results in parallel, and look for consensus among them.</p>
 PDF tables in the scientific record 
<p>
It’s my understanding that <a href="https://commoncrawl.org/">arxiv.org</a> is in the <a href="https://commoncrawl.org/">CommonCrawl</a>, so the LLMs are seeing zillions of tables in scientific papers. Tables are used there for layout, for data, or for a mixture of both purposes. Nowadays, when a conversation turns to the brokenness of scholarly publishing, and the perpetual dominance of data-unfriendly PDF formats, my eyes start to bleed. Semantic markup, smoothly implemented from inception to collaborative editing to HTML publication, was always the dream. Maybe it’ll never happen that way; instead, we’ll just use anything to write and edit, we’ll publish to PDF (but please not two-column!), and then we’ll extract document structure at the end of the toolchain. I never thought that might be possible, I’m not sure it’s a right answer, but this is a good time to be open to unconventional possibiliites. Whatever unlocks the data in the world’s corpus of scholarly PDFs is worth doing. </p>

Verified Permissions has been in gated preview since November, but now it's available to everyone.</p><p>My team worked on an integration between Verified Permissions and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/">Amazon Cognito</a>, Amazon's OpenID Connect service. The idea is pretty simple: if you're using Cognito to manage the people who use your application, then you will likely want to use the information that is stored in Cognito for your access control policies.</p><p>Our bit of code allows developers to just submit the tokens they get back from Cognito as a result of the authentication process to Verified Permissions. Verified Permissions uses the attributes they contain to perform a policy evaluation. I wrote a blog post for the AWS Security blog about how this works called <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/simplify-fine-grained-authorization-with-amazon-verified-permissions-and-amazon-cognito/">Simplify fine-grained authorization with Amazon Verified Permissions and Amazon Cognito</a>. I'll describe the basic idea here, but the blog post has details and links.</p><p>Suppose, you've got a policy that allows anyone to view any resource so long as their location is <code>USA</code>:</p> <code>permit(  
  principal,  
  action == Action::"view",  
  resource  
)
when {principal.location == "USA"};  
</code> <p>If <code>Alice</code> wants to view <code>VacationPhoto94.jpg</code>, then your call to Verified Permissions might look like this if you're not using the Cognito Token:</p> <code>//JS pseudocode  
const authResult = await avp.isAuthorized({  
    principal: 'User::"alice"',  
    action: 'Action::"view"',  
    resource: 'Photo::"VacationPhoto94.jpg"',  
    // whenever our policy references attributes of the entity, isAuthorized  
    // needs an entity argument that provides those attributes  
    entities: [  
        {
            "identifier": {  
                "entityType": "User",  
                "entityId": "alice"  
            },  
            "attributes": {  
                "location": {  
                    "String": "USA"  
                }
            }  
        ]
});  
</code> <p>You have to supply information about the principal and any relevant attributes so the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2023/04/minimal_vs_fully_qualified_access_requests.shtml">policy has the context it needs to evaluate correctly</a>. Now, suppose your Cognito token contains location information as an attribute:</p> <code>{
 ...  
 “iss”: “User”,  
 “sub”: “alice”,  
 “custom:location”: “USA”,  
 ...  
}
</code> <p>Assuming the token is stored in a variable named <code>cognito_id_token</code> you can make a call like this:</p> <code>const authResult = await avp.isAuthorizedWithToken({  
    identity_token: cognito_id_token  
    action: 'Action::"view"',  
    resource: 'Photo::"VacationPhoto94.jpg"'  
});  
</code> <p>Using <code>isAuthorizedWithToken</code>, you don’t have to supply the principal or construct the entities argument. Pretty slick.</p><p>Take a look at the blog post I mentioned earlier if you're interested in using this in your application. There's more information about the configuration process and how to add resource attributes to the call. This was a fun project.</p>   <p>Photo Credit: <a href="https://pixabay.com/photos/jigsaw-puzzle-puzzle-picture-pieces-712465/">Puzzle Pieces</a> from Erdenebayar (Pixabay Content License)</p>

<p>
Buoyed by the success of my <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2023/05/24/when-the-rubber-duck-talks-back/">LLM-assisted refactoring exercise</a>, I set a new and (for me) more ambitious goal. While the refactoring task was a bit challenging, I didn’t have to learn new concepts and syntax. The basic patterns and Go idioms for Steampipe plugins were already familiar, I just had to find the right way to rearrange things. </p>
<p>
Now, though, I wanted to tackle another project that I’d been blocked on: a slider widget for Steampipe <a href="https://steampipe.io/docs/dashboard/overview">dashboards</a>. Why? Well, there are million uses for an input control that reports continuously varying values. For example, the Mastodon dashboard currently limits results by means of a picklist with hardcoded values.</p>
 input "limit" {
  title = "Max results"
  type = "select"  
  sql = &lt;&lt;EOQ
    with limits(label) as (
      values
        ( '20' ),
        ( '40' ),
        ( '100' ),
        ( '200' ),
        ( '500' )
    )
    select
      label,
      label::int as value
    from
      limits
  EOQ
}
 
<p>
It would be nice, instead, to code a widget like this…</p>
 input "limit" {
  title = "Max results"
  type = "slider"
  sql = &lt;&lt;EOQ
    select
      20 as min,
      500 as max,
      40 as step,
      80 as default
  EOQ
}
 
<p>
…that renders something like this:</p>
<p>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/steampipe/minimal-slider-display.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>
Why was this an ambitious goal? In this case there were a whole bunch of new concepts and idioms to absorb. A Steampipe <a href="https://steampipe.io/docs/reference/mod-resources/overview">dashboard resource</a> touches many different aspects of the Steampipe system. The main components are: Steampipe itself, the base program that launches both Postgres and the dashboard server; the dashboard server that forwards queries to Steampipe and receives query results; and the dashboard app that defines widgets instantiated with query results. Multiple communication channels are in play, including a websocket connection from the dashboard server to the dashboard app, and event-driven message flow within the app. </p>
<p>
For aspiring plugin developers, there’s an SDK and documentation about common idioms and patterns. No such tooling or guidance is yet available to the widget developer. Parts of the dashboard system are written in Go code, parts in React-flavored TypeScript. I’d used TypeScript before, but had never touched React, so I not only needed to learn some key React concepts, I also had to grok how they look and feel in TypeScript. </p>
<p>
We’ve seen plenty of examples of LLMs writing Fibonacci generators, then writing tests for them, then translating from Python to JavaScript. Far more typical, I think, are tasks that require diving into an unfamiliar code base and learning just enough to make useful progress on some tactical goal.</p>
 Can you fly that thing? 
<p></p>
<p>
Here’s my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoAk7zBTrvo">favorite scene</a> in the Matrix.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Neo: Can you fly that thing?</p>
<p>

<p>
Trinity: Not yet. </p>
<p>
(picks up phone)</p>
<p>
Tank: Operator.</p>
<p>
Trinity: I need a pilot progam for a B-212 helicopter. Hurry.</p>
<p>
(eyelids flutter briefly)</p>
<p>
Trinity: Let’s go.</p>
<p>
(they jump in the chopper and fly off the roof)
</p></blockquote>
<p>
That’s what I want, and what we all need, for coding (among many other things). Could LLM assistants help me rapidly learn what I needed to know to add a basic slider to Steampipe’s gallery of widgets? That was my experiment, and here’s my report.</p>
 An overly-optimistic first try 
<p>
I started by feeding examples of existing input widgets to ChatGPT-4 and Sourcegraph Cody, and asking how to modify the patterns for a new slider widet. Predictably that yielded confident but useless results. Although Sourcegraph has now indexed the <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe">Steampipe repo</a>, and is presumably making <a href="https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/cody-is-cheating#sourcegraph-platform-101">embeddings</a> available to Cody, it wasn’t clear to me whether, or to what extent, that made a difference. No big deal, I wasn’t really expecting this approach to work, but it never hurts to ask!</p>
<p>
Next I tried prompting with a José Reyes <a href="https://jreyesr.github.io/posts/steampipe-part-int-pi-mods/">blog post</a> that contains a detailed explanation of how he made a <a href="https://steampipe.io/blog/release-0-20-0#time-axis-charts">significant improvement</a> to the <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe/pull/3214">chart widget</a>. Would that material supply enough useful context? Not for ChatGPT-4 or Cody, evidently. If there’s a way to craft a prompt that uses José’s explanation to produce a working slider, I’d love to see it.</p>
<p>
If you haven’t seen José’s blog, by the way, I commend it to you. Over the past few months he’s shown an astonishing ability to jump into diverse code bases and do useful things with them. His <a href="https://jreyesr.github.io/tags/steampipe/">Steampipe series</a>, in six installments so far, covers a wide variety of Steampipe topics in great depth and provides a wealth of instructive examples. </p>
<p>
It’s humbling, to be honest. I’ve worked for a while now on the periphery of the Steampipe, building plugins and dashboards, but have barely scratched the surface as a contributor to the core. Although I’m wary of applying the 10x label to a developer, José clearly deserves it. Me, not so much, 1x at best. I’m a fountain of good ideas that I often struggle to implement quickly and well, especially in code bases that span unfamiliar languages, frameworks, and components. If LLM augmentation can get me even to 1.5x or 2x, never mind 10x, that’ll be a huge win for me — and for a whole lot of average developers like me.</p>
 A more realistic next try 
<p>
Programmers aim to decompose tasks into small, manageable chunks. The same discipline applies when working with LLM assistants. For starters, I lowered the goal post. I originally hoped to implement a two-handled slider, like the one I used in this <a href="https://jonudell.info/av/">AV editor</a>. But first I needed a basic understanding of how to wire up any kind of new dashboard widget, and for that I wanted the simplest possible slider. </p>
<p>
I asked both ChatGPT-4 and Cody, in various ways, for ideas. At one point, Cody proposed &lt;input type="range"&gt;. Oh? No kidding? I didn’t know that was a thing, thanks Cody! A native HTML element was just the right starter element. There would still be plenty to learn about Steampipe/React/TypeScript conventions for wiring such a thing into Steampipe’s dashboard system. No need to complicate matters with a library that implements a fancier slider but brings extra conceptual baggage.</p>
<p>
As a widget developer, you’re operating in an environment where the results of your widget’s query are magically available in a data property that you can unpack in the widget’s TypeScript code. How is that data made available to the widget? It’s complicated. I spent a good while spelunking to find out how exactly it’s done, I still can’t clearly articulate all the ingredients, or data flows that interconnect them, and I didn’t find a way for the LLMs to usefully aid the investigation. At one point I found myself in Chromium’s devtools, looking at websocket traffic and setting breakpoints to isolate event sources and handlers. I can envision LLMs enlisting debuggers, just as ChatGPT can now consult WolframAlpha via a plugin, but we’re not there yet. Manual debugging (where available!) will remain a critical skill for exploring unfamiliar code. </p>
<p>
Tracing that data flow wasn’t strictly necessary, though. For my purposes, it was OK to just accept that the data property magically holds the results of the query. Now I needed to work out how to use that data to initialize the widget, and then wire up a handler to set a new value when the slider’s handle moves. As a React/TypeScript newbie, though, even that was nontrivial. Last time I tried I got lost in the abstractions and came up empty-handed. This time, I hoped my pair of rubber ducks could help me break through.</p>
 Exploring examples 
<p>
I modeled the slider on another widget type, <a href="https://steampipe.io/docs/reference/mod-resources/input#example-usage">select</a>, which builds a picklist and reports the selected item. It wasn’t an ideal starting point because there’s a family of select widgets, interrelated in ways that require more complex coding than the slider would. Neither of the LLMs managed to distill the essence of a slider from those examples, but in the back-and-forth dialog with them I began to put the pieces together.</p>
<p>
It was straightford to put a slider onto the canvas. Then it took me a while to work out how to wire it into the React machinery. At one point, as multiple useEffect hooks came into play, I found myself wondering about why their dependency arrays were sometimes empty. Both LLMs gave the same answer: an empty array means the effect only runs once after the initial render.</p>
<p>
I’m an example-driven learner, though, so I wanted to see which of the useEffect hooks in the code base work that way. ChatGPT-4 can’t see the whole repo, so it doesn’t know. Cody, in VSCode, does see the repo, and is further enlightened by the embeddings in Sourcegraph’s indexed copy of the repo. Cody found some of the examples, but not all. Then it occurred to me to try Sourcegraph’s <a href="https://docs.sourcegraph.com/code_search/reference/structural">structural search</a>. Here’s the query that found all the examples.</p>
 context:global repo:^github\.com/turbot/steampipe$ useEffect(..., []) 
 
<p>
It’s interesting to see that, while Cody is joined at the hip to the Sourcegraph web app — and indeed even runs in a sidebar there, as well as in VSCode — it doesn’t yet seem to tap into structural search. Perhaps that will become the first external tool that plugs into Cody?</p>
 Controlled vs uncontrolled components 
<p>
At one point, as I worked out how to persist the slider’s selected value, I encountered what I now realize is a common React error.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Warning: A component is changing a controlled input to be uncontrolled.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Me: Huh?  </p>
<p>
Cody: This warning is occurring because you are setting a value prop on the element, but also listening for onChange events. This is conflicting – either the input should be controlled (by setting the value prop) or uncontrolled (by listening for onChange events). To fix this, you have a few options:</p>
 
 
Make the input controlled by setting value and handling changes with an onChange handler that calls setValue().<p></p>
  
Make the input uncontrolled by removing the value prop and keeping the onChange handler.<p></p>
  
Use a ref to access the DOM input and read its value when needed: const inputRef = useRef&lt;HTMLInputElement&gt;(null);
  
<p>
Eventually I worked out how to do it both ways. Then I asked ChatGPT-4 and Cody to compare them, evaluate tradeoffs, and weigh in on which approach to take. One favored uncontrolled’s simplicity, the other liked controlled’s flexiblity. Ultimately that’s for the maintainer to decide, if this turns into a pull request. For now I’m sticking with controlled, with a better sense of why than I could otherwise have easily gained.</p>
 A catalog of concepts 
<p>
Beyond the controlled/uncontrolled distinction, here (courtesy of ChatGPT-4) are some of the concepts and idioms that this exercise introduced me to:</p>
 
 
        Functional Component: <code>SliderInput</code> is defined as a functional component. In TypeScript, the props that this component accepts are explicitly typed as <code>InputProps</code>.
     
 
        Props and TypeScript Interfaces: In TypeScript, interfaces are used to ensure the props have the correct type. The <code>data</code> and <code>name</code> props are passed to the <code>SliderInput</code> component, and their types are defined by the <code>InputProps</code> interface.
     
 
        Destructuring Props: The props are destructured in the function parameter, allowing the properties to be accessed directly as variables (<code>data</code> and <code>name</code>) instead of as properties on a props object.
     
 
        useState Hook with TypeScript: The <code>useState</code> hook is used to add state to functional components. In TypeScript, you can provide a type argument to this hook to specify the type of the state variable. In this case, <code>value</code> is defined as a state variable with the type <code>number</code>.
     
 
        useEffect Hook: The <code>useEffect</code> hook lets you perform side effects in function components. In this case, it’s used for two purposes: <p></p>
 
 To update the <code>value</code> state when the <code>stateValue</code> prop changes. 
 To dispatch an action to set the initial value of the slider when the <code>defaultValue</code> changes.  
 
 
 
        Custom Hooks with TypeScript: Custom hooks are a mechanism to reuse stateful logic between components. The <code>useDashboard</code> hook is used to access the <code>dispatch</code> function and <code>selectedDashboardInputs</code> state from a dashboard context. These returned values also have their own types defined.
     
 
        Event Handling with TypeScript: Event handlers are used to handle user interactions with the component. In this case, the <code>sliderChange</code> function is triggered when the slider value changes. The type of the event object <code>e</code> is inferred from the context, but it could also be explicitly defined with <code>React.ChangeEvent&lt;HTMLInputElement&gt;</code> for stricter type checking.
     
 
        JSX and TypeScript (TSX): JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that is used to describe what the UI should look like. When using TypeScript, this syntax is referred to as TSX. TypeScript provides additional type safety in TSX code.
  
<p>
The output of this exercise was a few dozen lines of code involving all that conceptual stuff. But the result of the exercise feels bigger. As a developer of Steampipe dashboards, there are a few other affordances I’d like to have. Yes, it’s open source, so I can contribute, but I’m hard-pressed to justify climbing that learning curve. The LLM assistants ease that curve; I’m a better learner with them than without them; more feels possible than before. Doug Engelbart dreamed of <a href="https://www.dougengelbart.org/pubs/augment-3906.html">augmenting human intellect</a>. I wish he’d lived to see this moment. </p>

<p>This article shows how to reset a password for tenant members using a Microsoft Graph application client in ASP.NET Core. An Azure App registration is used to define the application permission for the Microsoft Graph client and the User Administrator role is assigned to the Azure Enterprise application created from the Azure App registration.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/azuerad-reset">https://github.com/damienbod/azuerad-reset</a></p>



<p></p>



 Create an Azure App registration with the Graph permission 



<p>An Azure App registration was created which requires a secret or a certificate. The Azure App registration has the application User.ReadWrite.All permission and is used to assign the Azure role. This client is only for application clients and not delegated clients.</p>







<p></p>



 Assign the User Administrator role to the App Registration 



<p>The User Administrator role is assigned to the Azure App registration (Azure Enterprise application pro tenant). You can do this by using the User Administrator Assignments and and new one can be added. </p>







<p></p>



<p>Choose the Azure App registration corresponding Enterprise application and assign the role to be always active. </p>



<p></p>







<p></p>



 Create the Microsoft Graph application client 



<p>In the ASP.NET Core application, a new Graph application can be created using the Microsoft Graph SDK and Azure Identity. The GetChainedTokenCredentials is used to authenticate using a managed identity for the production deployment or a user secret in development. You could also use a certificate. This is the managed identity from the Azure App service where the application is deployed in production.</p>


  using Azure.Identity;
using Microsoft.Graph;

namespace SelfServiceAzureAdPasswordReset;

public class GraphApplicationClientService
{
    private readonly IConfiguration _configuration;
    private readonly IHostEnvironment _environment;
    private GraphServiceClient? _graphServiceClient;

    public GraphApplicationClientService(IConfiguration configuration, IHostEnvironment environment)
    {
        _configuration = configuration;
        _environment = environment;
    }

    /// &lt;summary&gt;
    /// gets a singleton instance of the GraphServiceClient
    /// &lt;/summary&gt;
    public GraphServiceClient GetGraphClientWithManagedIdentityOrDevClient()
    {
        if (_graphServiceClient != null)
            return _graphServiceClient;

        string[] scopes = new[] { "https://graph.microsoft.com/.default" };

        var chainedTokenCredential = GetChainedTokenCredentials();
        _graphServiceClient = new GraphServiceClient(chainedTokenCredential, scopes);

        return _graphServiceClient;
    }

    private ChainedTokenCredential GetChainedTokenCredentials()
    {
        if (!_environment.IsDevelopment())
        {
            // You could also use a certificate here
            return new ChainedTokenCredential(new ManagedIdentityCredential());
        }
        else // dev env
        {
            var tenantId = _configuration["AzureAdGraph:TenantId"];
            var clientId = _configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("AzureAdGraph:ClientId");
            var clientSecret = _configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("AzureAdGraph:ClientSecret");

            var options = new TokenCredentialOptions
            {
                AuthorityHost = AzureAuthorityHosts.AzurePublicCloud
            };

            // https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.identity.clientsecretcredential
            var devClientSecretCredential = new ClientSecretCredential(
                tenantId, clientId, clientSecret, options);

            var chainedTokenCredential = new ChainedTokenCredential(devClientSecretCredential);

            return chainedTokenCredential;
        }
    }
}
  


 Reset the password Microsoft Graph SDK 4 



<p>Once the client is authenticated, Microsoft Graph SDK can be used to implement the logic. You need to decide if SDK 4 or SDK 5 is used to implement the Graph client. Most applications must still use Graph SDK 4 but no docs exist for this anymore. Refer to Stackoverflow or try and error. The application has one method to get the user and a second one to reset the password and force a change on the next authentication. This is ok for low level security, but TAP with a strong authentication should always be used if possible. </p>


  using Microsoft.Graph;
using System.Security.Cryptography;

namespace SelfServiceAzureAdPasswordReset;

public class UserResetPasswordApplicationGraphSDK4
{
    private readonly GraphApplicationClientService _graphApplicationClientService;

    public UserResetPasswordApplicationGraphSDK4(GraphApplicationClientService graphApplicationClientService)
    {
        _graphApplicationClientService = graphApplicationClientService;
    }

    private async Task&lt;string&gt; GetUserIdAsync(string email)
    {
        var filter = $"startswith(userPrincipalName,'{email}')";

        var graphServiceClient = _graphApplicationClientService
            .GetGraphClientWithManagedIdentityOrDevClient();

        var users = await graphServiceClient.Users
            .Request()
            .Filter(filter)
            .GetAsync();

        return users.CurrentPage[0].Id;
    }

    public async Task&lt;string?&gt; ResetPassword(string email)
    {
        var graphServiceClient = _graphApplicationClientService
            .GetGraphClientWithManagedIdentityOrDevClient();

        var userId = await GetUserIdAsync(email);

        if (userId == null)
        {
            throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(email));
        }

        var password = GetRandomString();

        await graphServiceClient.Users[userId].Request()
        .UpdateAsync(new User
        {
            PasswordProfile = new PasswordProfile
            {
                Password = password,
                ForceChangePasswordNextSignIn = true
            }
        });

        return password;
    }

    private static string GetRandomString()
    {
        var random = $"{GenerateRandom()}{GenerateRandom()}{GenerateRandom()}{GenerateRandom()}-AC";
        return random;
    }

    private static int GenerateRandom()
    {
        return RandomNumberGenerator.GetInt32(100000000, int.MaxValue);
    }
}
  


<p></p>



 Reset the password Microsoft Graph SDK 5 



<p>Microsoft Graph SDK 5 can also be used to implement the logic to reset the password and force a change on the next signin.</p>


  using Microsoft.Graph;
using Microsoft.Graph.Models;
using System.Security.Cryptography;

namespace SelfServiceAzureAdPasswordReset;

public class UserResetPasswordApplicationGraphSDK5
{
    private readonly GraphApplicationClientService _graphApplicationClientService;

    public UserResetPasswordApplicationGraphSDK5(GraphApplicationClientService graphApplicationClientService)
    {
        _graphApplicationClientService = graphApplicationClientService;
    }

    private async Task&lt;string?&gt; GetUserIdAsync(string email)
    {
        var filter = $"startswith(userPrincipalName,'{email}')";

        var graphServiceClient = _graphApplicationClientService
            .GetGraphClientWithManagedIdentityOrDevClient();

        var result = await graphServiceClient.Users.GetAsync((requestConfiguration) =&gt;
        {
            requestConfiguration.QueryParameters.Top = 10;
            if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(email))
            {
                requestConfiguration.QueryParameters.Search = $"\"userPrincipalName:{email}\"";
            }
            requestConfiguration.QueryParameters.Orderby = new string[] { "displayName" };

<p>Any Razor page can use the service and update the password. The Razor Page requires protection to prevent any user or bot updating any other user account. Some type of secret is required to use the service or an extra id which can be created from an internal IT admin. DDOS protection and BOT protection is also required if the Razor page is deployed to a public endpoint and a delay after each request must also be implemented. Extreme caution needs to be taken when exposing this business functionality.</p>

<p>The demo application can be started and a password from a local member can be reset.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://mysignins.microsoft.com/security-info">https://mysignins.microsoft.com/security-info</a> url can be used to test the new password and add MFA or whatever.</p>



 Notes 



<p>You can use this solution for applications with no user. If using an administrator or a user to reset the passwords, then a delegated permission should be used with different Graph SDK methods and different Graph permissions. Extra protection is required to prevent admin accounts or break glass accounts or incorrect accounts being reset. Admin account should be no problem because these accounts should already be using FIDO2 and no password  with no recovery possible using password alone.</p>

<p>Here is one of the five sessions I participated in at the event, and below is the session abstract.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In this session, we delve into the crucial role of government in the evolution of identity and authentication. We explore a range of interconnected concepts, including legislation, policy governance, regulation, public trust, inclusion, equity, equality, security, and technology. The focus is on understanding what governments can and should be doing in these areas and how the answers to these questions may vary across countries and contexts. By comparing and contrasting different approaches, we gain valuable insights into the potential impact of government actions on shaping the future of identity and authentication.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here is one of the five sessions I participated in at the event, and below is the session abstract.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmoBNwoMzWg">this session</a>, we explored the practical implementation of organizational identity within the telecommunications service provider industry. We delve into the problems it can solve, the beneficiaries, and the real-world applications. Specifically, we focus on how organizational identity can empower telecommunications service providers to enhance the value of their services for enterprises, strengthening customer engagement, building solid reputations, and mitigating the risks of impersonation.</p>
<p>By putting organizational identity into action, we discuss how it can effectively protect consumers from fraud, address regulatory concerns, and empower individuals with greater control and informed decision-making. The ultimate goal is to foster a broader ecosystem of trust within the telecommunications industry.</p>
<p>Throughout <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmoBNwoMzWg">the session</a>, we provide practical examples that showcase the possibilities of achieving these outcomes collaboratively. Click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmoBNwoMzWg">here</a> to learn more about the transformative potential of organizational identity and its implications for telecommunications service providers.</p>

<p>I had an amazing time organizing the MEF CONNECTS ID &amp; AUTH: The Dawn of Personal Data &amp; Identity hybrid event. It was such a joy working with all 38 speakers for the event. I also really enjoyed participating in the event as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is one of the five sessions I participated in at the event, and below is the session abstract.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The discussion revolved around the intricate tapestry of personal and organizational data, identity, and the various market forces that shape this landscape, including culture, technology, regulations, commercials, and politics.</p>
<p>During my session, I had the privilege to delve into The Identity Nexus Equation, which holds the key to unlocking the true potential of our digital identities. I emphasized the crucial need to understand why ART (Authenticity, Responsibility, and Trust) must be true in this context. By juxtaposing personal data and identity with organizational identity, we uncovered the interconnectedness and symbiotic relationship between them.</p>
<p>To add an element of surprise and additional insight, we were joined by a special guest who provided valuable perspectives on the importance of ART in our journey towards achieving The Identity Nexus. This collaborative discussion shed light on the significance of authenticity, responsibility, and trust in fostering a secure and empowered digital ecosystem.</p>
<p>The event served as a platform to explore the complex dynamics at play in the data and identity landscape, and to inspire attendees to actively contribute to the realization of The Identity Nexus. It was an incredible opportunity to share knowledge, exchange ideas, and collectively work towards a future where personal and organizational identities coexist harmoniously.</p>
<p>I am immensely grateful for the experience and eagerly look forward to future engagements where we can continue our quest to solve The Identity Nexus Equation and advance the understanding and implementation of ART in the digital realm.</p>

<p>I had a great time participating in this thought-provoking <a href="https://gbuinnovation.podbean.com/e/michael-becker-advisor-author-speaker-talks-about-online-identity-and-authorisation-in-a-wide-ranging-and-expert-podcast/">podcast episode</a>. Where we take you on a captivating journey exploring the possibilities, pitfalls, and potential of online identity.</p>
<p>Covering a wide range of topics, we delve into the exponential changes happening in the digital landscape and examine the interactions between the three domains interested in identity: personal, private institutions, and public institutions. We uncover the value found in transactions between these domains and discover the importance of the community commons at the intersection of all domains.</p>
<p>Drawing parallels with the metaphorical “Meeting of the Waters,” we explore the interests and concerns of top-down ID/authentication initiatives versus personal interests and concerns. We also discuss upcoming EIDAS regulations, the concept of smart wallets, and the profound impact of algorithms on personal reputation.</p>
<p>Addressing the critical issues of identity theft and fraud, we recognize the current protection measures in place while uncovering the real and tragic costs associated with identity fraud. We contemplate the balance between self-sovereignty and the risks of anarchy and chaos that excessive individual control can bring.</p>
<p>Central to our discussion is the notion of the Identity Nexus, where individuals, private institutions, and public institutions converge. We explore the Identity Nexus Equation and introduce an exciting new term coined by Michael: the “Phigiverse“, representing the intersection of the physical and digital worlds.</p>
<p>Remember to tune in to this captivating <a href="https://gbuinnovation.podbean.com/e/michael-becker-advisor-author-speaker-talks-about-online-identity-and-authorisation-in-a-wide-ranging-and-expert-podcast/">podcast episode</a> as we gain insights into the complexities of online identity, authentication, and the fascinating realm of the “Phigiverse“.</p>

<p><a href="https://flickr.com/photos/docsearls/51852086041/"></a></p>
<p>This blog has been looking like my personal obituary section, and I suppose it is. While I promise to change that, for this post I’ll stick with the theme, and surface some correspondence with an old friend who recommended that I read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Five-People-You-Meet-Heaven/dp/1401308589/">The Five People You’ll Meet in Heaven</a>, by <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/Mitch-Albom/author/B000AQ79EY">Mitch Albom</a>. In the correspondence that followed, I shared some of my own views across life’s horizons. Thinking those perhaps blogworthy, here’s what I said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Just ordered the book.</p>
<p>Odd that I’m a lifelong Christian (technically, Catholic) who (thanks to my wife, who is observant) attends mass every Sunday. Yet I believe the most useful teachings of all the major religions at their best are about kindness and mercy toward other people and the world, and that our sum purpose as conscious and responsible beings is to leave the place better than we found it. In this sense, eternal life is gravy, not meat and potatoes.</p>
<p>So I will be surprised and pleased if there really is an afterlife of some kind. And I would dearly love to hang again with those five people, plus my parents and other loved ones who are, as we say in this world of time and space, departed.</p>
<p>However, absent proof here in time/space world, the way to bet is pure absence: an afterlife like the beforelife.</p>
<p>Did you know I was working for the <a href="https://www.psychicalresearchfoundation.com/">Psychical Research Foundation</a>, which studied the possibility of life after death, at (but not of) Duke University when I met <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2022/03/30/exitings/">David Hodskins</a> and <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2011/11/29/remembering-ray/">Ray Simone</a>? This was an occasion without which I would likely never have met <a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2011/01/08/a-good-man-is-hard-to-lose-2/">Gil Templeton</a>, <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2021/12/03/remembering-kim-cameron/">Kim Cameron</a>, <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2022/07/27/remembering-craig-burton/">Craig Burton</a> and others I’ve memorialized online. It see now for the first time that the poetry in that, with those guys—all younger than me—while I’m still here. Wherever this is.</p>
<p>Our favorite priest,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.spiritsinspacesuits.com/">Father Sean Olaoire</a>, calls people “spirits in space suits.” This is consistent with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Hicks">Bill Hicks</a>‘ take: “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzQuE1pR1w%5C">It’s just a ride</a>.” Sean and Bill’s case: we are timeless beings who catch a ride in time and get off when it’s over. We need Wise Ones like Jesus to tell us that our world view is insufficient, and the real myth is mortality.</p>
<p>So, we’ll find out. Or not. Either way, it’s best to clean up first. I’m at that stage now, even though I still have work to do. Back to it.</p></blockquote>
<p>So I’m back. See you soon.</p>

<p>デジタルIDの世界では今 #デジタルIDウォレット や #分散アイデンティティ が熱くなっています。EUでの採用が決まったというのも大きいです。日本でも #web3 が国家戦略になって、Trusted Webでも実証などが行われています。</p>



<p>しかし、ここでいう「分散」「集中（中央集権）<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/06/5316/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-5316" title="日本では centralised というのを中央集権と訳す人が多いですがおそらく誤訳で「集中」が適切な訳かと思います。">1</a>」という言葉は、よく理解されないで使われているようです。また、「web1は分散、web2は集中、web3は分散」という語り・ナラティブも神話にまみれています。</p>



<p>そこで、今回のアイデンティティ夜話では、「分散の誤謬〜AとZの狭間かCypherpunkの夢か？」と題して神話を打破し、本質を問い直します。 </p>



 あらすじ 



<p>もくじというか、おおまかな話の流れはこんな感じです。</p>



 
 Web3にありがちなナラティブ 



 Web2.0: 究極の「機能・データ」分散 



 Web2革命軍とアンシャンレジーム 



 革命の夢のあと 



 一体全体如何して何故？ 



 Web3は解決策たりうるのか？ 



 分散のグラデーション（階調）

  <p>It’s that time of the year again when the measurements of covid positivity and wastewater have fallen to a minimum and resentment toward symbols of public health are amplified.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://herestomwiththeweather.com/2023/02/19/toews-has-long-covid/">mentioned back in February</a>, the career of one of the greatest hockey players of all time was curtailed for a 34 year old by long covid. According to <a href="https://www.fairhealth.org/article/fair-health-releases-study-on-post-covid-conditions">Patients Diagnosed with Post-COVID Conditions</a>, the 36 to 50 age group is the age group most likely to be diagnosed with long covid.</p>

<p>Despite being on the favorable side of the graph right now, whenever I’m uncertain about air ventilation, I am still wearing a mask.  For me, it’s always the locker room.  When we’re near the maximum point of the graphs, I generally dress outside the locker room.</p>

<p>If you’re on the fediverse, please consider following <a href="https://mstdn.social/@erictopol">Eric Topol</a>. In his article <a href="https://erictopol.substack.com/p/the-brain-and-long-covid">The Brain and Long Covid</a>, he references <a href="https://erictopol.substack.com/i/124215133/the-hamburg-study">The Hamburg Study</a> which seems particularly insightful.  The participants were unvaccinated and long covid was not a criteria for selection.  It was simply 223 people with mild to moderate covid against 223 controls with no evidence of covid.  He notes</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The MRI inflammatory marker abnormalities were so pronounced that machine learning could accurately differentiate which scans were from the Covid patients vs the control group</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Despite the MRI scans being taken 10 months after the fact, it was still possible to determine who had been infected even for mild cases.</p>

<p>I’m hopeful that we will make real progress in long covid research but until then, the current rules to the game seem unfavorable without sensible mitigations.</p>

<p>昔から、「OpenIDは認証でOAuthは認可だ」などということが言われます。しかし、その言語の意味を取り違えている方が結構多い気がしています。「もうOpenIDなんていらね。OAuthだけでいいじゃん」というような言説がよく流れてくるのがその証拠だと思います。OAuth認証というのもその類ですね。</p>



<p>そこで、今日はOAuthとOpenIDの違いを考えてみたいと思います。</p>



 

 Youtube版







 OpenIDは紹介状、OAuthは合鍵 



<p>まずはOpenIDの概要の復習です。「OpenIDは認証」という言葉の内容をまずは復習してみましょう。<br>「認証」とは大変広い言葉でいろいろな場面で使われますが、「OpenIDは認証」という使い方の時は、「OpenIDは、いま来ている人の身元を認証」（ユーザ認証）という意味です。図にすると図1のような流れになります。</p>



<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.sakimura.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image.png?ssl=1"></a>



<p>この例では、有栖さんがお客としてサービス提供をしているサイトである伊部さんのところに行きます。</p>



<p>「伊部さん伊部さん、お宅のサービスを提供していただきたいのですが。」<br>「有栖さん、とおっしゃるのですね。申し訳ありませんが、本当に有栖さんなのかわからないので、宮来さんから紹介状をもらってきていただけませんか？紹介状にはメールアドレスも忘れずに。」<br>「わかりました。」<br>「宮来さん、お願いがあるのですが。」<br>「はい、なんでしょうか。」<br>「伊部さん向けにメールアドレス入の紹介状を書いていただきたいのですが。」<br>「有栖さん、わかりました。それではこれを持って行って下さい。」<br>「ありがとうございます。」<br>「伊部さん伊部さん、紹介状を持ってきました。」<br>「お、たしかに宮来さんの紹介状ですね。確かにあなたは有栖さんのようです。メアドもわかりました。では、サービスをご提供しましょう。」</p>



<p>こんなかんじです。伊部さんに対して有栖さんは自分が有栖であることを証明するために、紹介者(Identity Provider)宮来（ぐうぐる）さんに紹介状を書いてもらって、これを有栖さんは伊部さんに渡しています。伊部さんは、「宮来さんの紹介なら信用できるだろう」と考えて、有栖さんが本当に有栖和歌子さんだと認めてあげ、様々なサービスを提供します。</p>



<p>次にOAuthで認証をしていると呼ばれているような場合についてみてみましょう。</p>



<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.sakimura.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-6.png?ssl=1"></a>



<p>図２で「認証もどき」としたのは、本来ユーザ認証ではない行為を認証の代わりに使っているからです。ここでは伊部さんに対して、自分が有栖だということを証明するために、自分の表札がかかったマンションの部屋の合鍵を管理人(OAuth Server)の津逸田（ついった）さんに作ってもらって、それを伊部さんに渡しています。</p>



<p>「伊部さん伊部さん、お宅のサービスを提供していただきたいのですが。」<br>「有栖さん、とおっしゃるのですね。申し訳ありませんが、本当に有栖さんなのかわからないので、有栖さんの家の合鍵をいただけませんか？そしたら、部屋の中を見て有栖さんかどうか確かめるので」<br>「わかりました。」<br>「津逸田さん、お願いがあるのですが。伊部さんに渡す合鍵がほしいのです。」<br>「わかりました。ではこの鍵を渡して下さい。」<br>「ありがとうございました。」<br>「伊部さん、はい、合鍵です。」<br>「おお、ありがとうございます。」</p>



<p>伊部さんはこの合鍵で有栖さんの部屋に入って、<br>「ほほう、たしかに有栖さんの部屋に入れた。ということは、あなたは有栖さんだと認めてあげましょう。」<br>となって、有栖さんに様々なサービスを提供します。</p>



<p>OpenIDの時との大きな違いは、OpenIDの場合は単なる紹介状なので、伊部さんは悪さをしようと思っても、せいぜい有栖さんのメールアドレスを名簿屋さんに売るくらいしかできないのに対して、OAuthの場合は、伊部さんは有栖さんの家の中に入っていって、恋人とのラブレターのやり取りを「わーい、ラブレターみっけ。へー、こんな写真のやり取りしてるんだ。」と読んだり、モノを壊したり、有栖さんの友達に迷惑メールを撒き散らしたりやりたい放題にできるということです。え？そんなことは無いだろうって？いや、これ実際にTwitterのOAuth認証で起きたことですから<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/06/1087/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-1087" title="<a href=&quot;https://www.sakimura.org/2011/05/1097/&quot;>Twitter、アプリのDMアクセスを自動削除へ(2011-05-19)</a>">1</a>。DM読み放題になってたんですね。すぐに直しましたが。</p>



<p>有栖さんが伊部さんの事をよく知っていて、本当に信頼できるなら、それでも構いません。例えば、わたしの家では家の掃除をしてくれる方に合鍵を渡しています。これは、非常に便利なことですしまっとうなことです。しかし、よく知りもしないウェブサイトにOAuthで認証もどきをしてログインして回るというのは、そこら中に合鍵をばらまいて歩いていることになり、大変危険です。今も昔もOpenIDよりもOAuth認証をしたいというサイトが増えてきているのもなぜだかわかりますよね。合鍵をもらったほうがいろいろとサービス提供したり悪さをしたりするのに便利だからです。しかし、合鍵を持っている人がその家の居住者とは限りません。多くの場合は違います。ですので、「OAuth認証」はユーザ認証にはならないのです。</p>



 OAuthで正しく認証するには～OpenID Connect 



<p>さて、例えば twitter の OAuth で「認証もどき」をするのは大変危険だということはおわかりいただけたと思います。正しく認証だけをするには、紹介状を使うのが良いということになります。この紹介状のことをOpenID Connect(OIDC)ではIDトークンといいます。</p>



<p>IDトークンには様々な情報を書くことができます。その人の名前やメールアドレスなどの他に、このユーザが実際にいつどのような身元確認（運転免許証を使って誰がいつどのような根拠に基づいてなど）をしたのか、ユーザ認証（SMS認証、パスキーなど）をしたのかなども書き入れて送ることができます。こうした「どういう確認をしたのか」というのは、本人についての情報というより、本人の身元確認やユーザ認証についての情報（メタデータ）です。これらがわからないと、そのユーザ認証の安全度が実はわかりません。そこで、OpenID Connect では、こうしたことも合わせて紹介状にして送ることができるようにしているのです。これが、図3の手続き４までの流れです。</p>



<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.sakimura.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2.png?ssl=1"></a>



<p>また、紹介状以外に、あとからその人が現在どういう状況にあるのかということを確認することもできるようにしています。これには、紹介状と一緒に、有栖さんの伊部さん向けの現況説明書のコピーだけが入っている伊部さん専用ロッカーの鍵（アクセストークン）をわたすことによって実現しています。この鍵を使って、伊部さんは必要に応じて有栖さんの現況を知ることができます。このロッカーのことを「UserInfo （ユーザ情報）Endpoint」といいます。OAuthの保護リソースになります。これがあることによって、その場にユーザが居ないときでも、伊部さんは有栖さんの現況を知ることが得できるようになっています。</p>



<p>このように、OpenID ConnectではIDトークンを使って、今そこに来たユーザの認証情報を渡すとともに、後日、OAuthを使いながら安全に現況確認をできるようにしているのです。OpenID Connectは、OAuthの上のアイデンティティ層であると呼ばれるのはそういう理由からです。</p>



 分散クレームと集約クレーム 



 分散クレーム 



<p>この伊部さん専用のロッカーには、有栖さんの現況が書いてある紙が入っているだけでなく、伊部さんにわたしたい他のものも入れておくことができます。例えば、第三者からもらった資格証明書だとか、他のロッカーの鍵などです。伊部さんはそうやって取り出した鍵を使って、他のロッカーに行って、そこに入れてある情報を取り出したりもできます。図4は、この関係を表しています。</p>



<p>このように、他のロッカーにある情報を取りに行くモデルのことをOpenID Connectでは分散クレーム（Distributed Claims）といいます。「クレーム」というと聞き慣れない言葉で、日本語では「文句」みたいに聞こえたりもしますが、英語にはそのようなニュアンスはなく「主張」という意味しかありません。ここではそれぞれの属性をそれぞれのサイトが正しいと主張している値ということで「クレーム」と呼んでいます。紹介状ってそういうものですよね。</p>



<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.sakimura.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-4.png?ssl=1"></a>



<p>サイトX, Y, Z は、OAuthの保護リソース(Protected Resources)にあたります。OpenID Connectでは、それぞれのサイトに伊部さんがアクセスするための鍵もUserInfo Endpoint に入っていて、伊部さんはこれを使ってこれらサイトにアクセスして最新の情報を取ってくることができます。</p>



 集約クレーム 



<p>一方では、集約クレーム(Aggregated Claims)という方式もあります。図５がこれをあらわしています。ここでは、UserInfo Endpointが、サイトX, Y, Z に事前に有栖さんが取得しておいた鍵（アクセストークン）でアクセスしてクレームを取ってきて、それを集約して伊部さんに返します。</p>



<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.sakimura.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-5.png?ssl=1"></a>



 まとめ 



<p>というわけで、まとめです。</p>



<p>OpenID Connectは、OAuthを使って安全にユーザ認証を行うだけでなく、インターネット上に散在する様々な情報をやりとりしたり、サービス提供を可能にする分散アイデンティティアーキテクチャです。2023年現在、ネットを使っている人でOpenID Connectを使っていない人はほぼ居ないと言われるほど普及しています。「Appleでサインイン」も「Googleサインイン」も「マイクロソフトサインイン」もみなOpenID Connectです。「インターネットのアイデンティティ層（レイヤー）」というキャッチフレーズもあながち嘘ではないのです。</p>

<p>Communication Service Providers (CSP) are in a challenging situation; they face, as we all do, declining trust in digital communications.</p>
<p>The decline in digital communications trust is occurring as a result of the connected individual’s exposure—either directly or indirectly—to unwanted or harmful communications, including robocalls, emails, sms messages, phishing and smishing messages, and more, as well as rampant, not recognized or well understood, phygital surveillance.</p>
<p>These communications and surveillance are annoying and distracting at best and, at worst, can lead to lasting and material harms: emotional, physical, digital (e.g., malware, ransomware), phygital, reputational, and financial. They can lead to losing sovereignty, agency, liberty, equity, equality, and dignity. In some rare cases, they can even lead to death. Most of these harms originate at the source, the initiator or sender of communication and engagement, not the individual. These senders, either unintentionally, intentioned but within the law, or intentioned outside of the law, are at the root of most harm.</p>
 Harm one, harm them all. 
<p>These harms do not simply affect the human, the “natural person,” as the GDPR calls them; they affect us all. When referring to the connected individual, we are not simply talking about the natural person, which tends to be our initial frame of reference; we are also talking about formal and informal groups, communities, enterprises, or governments, as well as&nbsp;<a href="http://[https//hbr.org/2014/11/how-smart-connected-products-are-transforming-competition%5D(https://hbr.org/2014/11/how-smart-connected-products-are-transforming-competition)">our things</a>&nbsp;(e.g., IoT devices, capital asset, that have their own independent identities, can increasingly make their own independent decisions, and are producing the lion share of data; often sensitive data, valuable data, in real-time).</p>
<p>From the natural person perspective, the research is clear; people feel helpless and indifferent (<a href="http://[https//mobileecosystemforum.com/u-s-college-students-trust-study/%5D(https://mobileecosystemforum.com/u-s-college-students-trust-study/_)">MEF Trust Studies</a>); they are myriad in the privacy paradox. They do not think they can protect themselves, are incapable of managing their identity or reaping value from their data (something we can discuss and need to rectify), and lack the tools and education to do so. So, rather than taking personal phygital-accountability, they look to businesses and the government to protect them. According to the 2023 Telesign&nbsp;<a href="http://[https//www.telesign.com/continuous-trust-authority%5D(https://www.telesign.com/continuous-trust-authority)">Trust Index and recently launched Continuous Trust Authority</a>, 94% of consumers [connected individuals] surveyed agree that businesses bear responsibility for consumers’ privacy. And when consumers trust a brand, they reward that company with their business. According to&nbsp;<a href="http://[https//www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/public-sector/close-the-trust-gap-to-improve-outcomes-and-improve-customer-engagement.pdf%5D(https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/public-sector/close-the-trust-gap-to-improve-outcomes-and-improve-customer-engagement.pdf)">Deloitte</a>,&nbsp;people spend 25% more money with trusted brands.</p>
<p>However, The crucial problem is that individuals’ fundamental intentions and goals rarely align long-term with those of the business or government they interact with. Sure, their intentions and goals may align short-term for an episodic transaction, but long term, they often diverge. There is an asymmetry in knowledge and power between the individual and the commercial and civic actors. People give away immense value, i.e., data, for the immediate transaction; this value can only be crawled back with great effort.</p>
 It Is Time To Bring Personal and Organizational Identity Together 
<p>So, the big questions are, how do we bring back trust? How do we re-empower the individual with privacy and control, online and offline, in the metaverse or phygiverse? The existing methods—industry self-regulation, government regulations, centralized registries, or tried and true axioms like “trust, but verify”—work in limited ways. However, they leave much to be desired, not fully solving the problem. For instance, cybercrime, e.g., data breaches as a proxy, is rising yearly, causing trillions in damages, and the peak is nowhere in sight.</p>
<p>What we need are four things: 1) we must “distrust, then verify,” 2) to stop treating individuals as the social, commercial, and civic entre on the table to nourish all; instead, we need to get them off the table and give them a seat at the table, 3) to make an effort to achieve&nbsp;<a href="http://[https//identitypraxis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/TheIdentityNexus2023.png%5D(https://identitypraxis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/TheIdentityNexus2023.png)">The Identity Nexus</a>&nbsp;and solve&nbsp;<a href="http://[https//identitypraxis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/TheIdentityNexusEquation.png%5D(https://identitypraxis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/TheIdentityNexusEquation.png)">The Identity Nexus equation</a>; that is, to achieve a steady-state macro value to risk exchange ratio equilibrium between the actors (individuals, public and private organizations, and the community commons), and finally, 4) to strive for wide-spread participation in the personal and organizational identity ecosystem, an ecosystem that systemically holds every actor accountable for their actions, while preserving each actor’s social, commercial, and civic, privacy, capital, and legal rights.</p>
<blockquote><p>Join us for the MEF CONNECTS ID &amp; AUTH EVENT:&nbsp;The&nbsp;<a href="http://[https//mobileecosystemforum.com/events_/mef-connects-personal-data-identity-2/%5D(https://mobileecosystemforum.com/events_/mef-connects-personal-data-identity-2/)">MEF CONNECTS ID &amp; AUTH: The Dawn of Personal and Organizational Identity</a>&nbsp;hybrid event, on May 25 in London (there is still time to&nbsp;<a href="http://[https//hopin.com/events/mef-connects-personal-data-identity%5D(https://hopin.com/events/mef-connects-personal-data-identity)">register</a>—participation is FREE—for in-person and online live stream; all registered participants will get access to the post-event recordings) is the industry’s first-ever event to bring the personal identity and organizational identity worlds together.</p></blockquote>
<p>Personal Identity empowers people to have agency, dignity, and sovereignty of their phygital self. Organizational identity not only enables organizations to be cryptographically verified across all engagements and interactions (B2B, B2C, A2P, M2P, M2M, etc.)—globally, across jurisdictions, and across channels; it also ensures that anyone interfacing with the organization’s designated representatives, i.e., their agents—humans, bots, machines, APIs, messages, etc.— can automatically and without human intervention, validate the authority of the agent. Collectively, participants within the personal and organizational identity ecosystem should experience reduced exposure to cybercrime, increased revenue, reduced cost, more efficient operations, and several more benefits. The personal and organizational identity ecosystem is bringing in a new era of systemic trust; the trust elements, i.e., the personal credential and the organizational credential, are readily accessible, e.g., in a decentralized ledger or embedded directly into a communication. In other words, in every moment of truth, the actors’ actions can be verified, which means we can hold them accountable for their actions, which will enable verified attribution and, therefore, help us build verified reputations. For businesses, this will establish the next major business metric, “the number of verified connections.”</p>
 Nurturing the Personal and Organizational Ecosystem: It Takes a Community 
<p>To nurture this ecosystem, the entire community needs to come together. We need to leverage the five lenses—technology, culture, legal &amp; regulatory, commercial, and political—to build flexible, agile, interoperable, and contextually relevant sources of truth, governance models, trust frameworks, policies, standards, protocols, open-source software, self-regulatory initiatives (principles, codes of conduct, guidelines, best practices), fair and reasonable government regulation (law, legislations, rules, regulations),&nbsp;<a href="https://openwallet.foundation/">OpenWallets</a>, refined customer experiences, and educational programming that will help everyone thrive and flourish.</p>
<p>CPSs, especially, will need to do all of the above but within the context of assisting their executives and clients in understanding and adopting these new technologies and experiences. They’ll need to root out cybercrime at the source. To adopt organizational credentials and verified delegated authority. And revisit and reshape their business models.</p>

<p>In Azure AD it has been possible to use roles with users and groups to implement authorization and access controls for software solutions. This makes IAM access management easy to apply in the Azure cloud. This is not possible when using the existing Microsoft identity customer solution Azure AD B2C and is one of the new features added to Entra External ID CIAM.</p>



<p>This is really easy to implement. The required roles can be created in the Azure App registration in the App roles blade. The roles must be of type Users/Groups because the roles are only applied to delegated authenticated identities (human based). </p>







<p></p>



<p>The Azure App registration App roles can be assigned to users or groups. In larger Azure clouds, the roles would be assigned to dynamic security groups or standard security groups and the groups would be assigned with members or a user group with members to this permission group. Assigning roles to users directly will only work for very small user based systems. You can mix groups and users as required.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>







<p></p>



<p>The roles can now be used in the ASP.NET Core application. This requires three steps:</p>



 
 Authentication of the identity (user + application) 



 Add the claims correctly to the claims principal in the ASP.NET Core application 



 Use the claims for authorization using ASP.NET Core Policies 
 



<p>Using the default Microsoft.Identity.Web client, the first two steps can be implemented in a very simple way. The client package does the heavy lifting. Sometimes you need to fix the namespaces in the claims, but this usually works good.</p>



<p>The claims can be displayed for the authenticated user in the UI</p>


  public void OnGet()
{
	var claims = User.Claims.ToList();
	foreach(var claim in claims)
	{
		if(claim != null &amp;&amp; claim.Type == "roles")
		{
			Roles.Add(claim.Value);
		}
	}
}
  


<p>I just iterate through each role claim.</p>


  @{
    foreach( var role in Model.Roles)
    {
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Role:&lt;/b&gt; @role&lt;/p&gt;
    }
}
  


<p>When using the role claim for authorization, you should never use this directly. Always use an ASP.NET Core authorization policy in the application and map the claim role definition to the requirement in the policy. The keeps the authorization simple and defined in one place. The claims are definitions or descriptions about the identity. The descriptions should not be also used as authorization rules but should be used to help define the authorization rules. For more complex authorization logic, ASP.NET Core authorization handlers can be used to implement the logic.</p>



 ASP.NET Core Authorization using role claims 



<p>The authorization policies can be added in the AddAuthorization method. the policies can use a claim directly or use an ASP.NET Core AuthorizationHandler. All identity descriptions are mapped or used in the policies and handlers. Only the policies are used in the application.</p>


  builder.Services.AddAuthorization(options =&gt;
{
    options.AddPolicy("UserPolicy", policy =&gt; {
        policy.RequireClaim("roles", "user-role");
    });
    options.AddPolicy("AdminPolicy", policy =&gt; {
        policy.RequireClaim("roles", "admin-role");
    });
    options.AddPolicy("UserAdminPolicy", policy =&gt; {
        policy.AddRequirements(new UserAdminRequirement());
    });
    options.FallbackPolicy = options.DefaultPolicy;
});
  


<p></p>



<p>If you have complex authorization business logic, this can be supported by implementing an AuthorizationHandler class. The Handler requires an IAuthorizationRequirement.</p>


  public class UserAdminRequirement : IAuthorizationRequirement {}
  


<p>UserAdminHandler implements the AuthorizationHandler with the UserAdminRequirement. This checks if a identity has the required claim.</p>


  public class UserAdminHandler 
	: AuthorizationHandler&lt;UserAdminRequirement&gt;
{
    protected override Task HandleRequirementAsync(
        AuthorizationHandlerContext context, 
		UserAdminRequirement requirement)
    {
        var userRole = context.User
			.FindFirst(c =&gt; c.Type == "roles" 
				&amp;&amp; c.Value == "user-role");
        var adminRole = context.User
			.FindFirst(c =&gt; c.Type == "roles" 
				&amp;&amp; c.Value == "admin-role");

        if (userRole != null || adminRole != null)
        {
            context.Succeed(requirement);
        }

        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
  


<p>The handler needs to be registered in the IoC.</p>


  builder.Services.AddSingleton&lt;IAuthorizationHandler, UserAdminHandler&gt;();
  


<p>The authorization policies are applied to the pages.</p>


  [Authorize(Policy = "UserAdminPolicy")]
public class UserAdminModel : PageModel
  


<p></p>



<p>When the application is started, the user can authenticate and the authorization is forced. In this test, the admin user is missing the role to view the user page. Normally you would also hide the link to the user page.  This is usability, authorization can only be forced in trusted backends.</p>







<p></p>



<p>The admin page displays the business because to identity is authorized to view this.</p>







<p></p>



 Notes 



<p>Authorization with CIAM has all the power like Azure AD and makes it possible to use the same tools to manage the user, application and device identities. I really missed this in Azure AD B2C.</p>

<p>I am ensconced in rattan chair on a screened porch overlooking a marsh at high tide. A bridge over the Harbor River connects this spit of sand to the chartreuse expanse of St. Helena Island, an anchor for the Gullah community, descendants of enslaved Central and West Africans brought to South Carolina to toil on the rice and sea island cotton plantations.</p>
<p>I came to this little cottage with my mom to celebrate her eightieth birthday. We dined alfresco with big bowls of salad on the beach, hers sweet with fruit, mine savory with avocado and tomatoes. We dipped our feet in a warm tidepool and tucked into a beach bag of books. My dad, suffering from late-stage Alzheimers, is back in Charlotte in a care facility. It is bittersweet sojourn, but an appropriate destination to contemplate the ebbs and flows of existence and the expansive web of connections into which our lives are woven across time and space.</p>
<p>The novel I packed, Herve Le Tellier’s “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/03/books/review-anomaly-herve-le-tellier.html">The Anomaly</a>” on the recommendation of a friend a few months back, was a good choice. So far it has held a few synchronicities for me – axolotl and physicists in the New Jersey Pinelands (Ong’s Hat, which I visited a few weeks ago). The author raises questions of faith, mechanics, quantum simulations, and many worlds – what is all of this anyway, the hours we pass together?</p>
<p>On the four-hour drive to the coast, we listened to Robin Wall Kimmerer’s “Braiding Sweetgrass.” It’s been awhile since I let her world view wash over me. Her writings on reciprocity and right relationship and the majesty of a responsive, animate world was exactly what I needed to open my heart to this resilient place, bursting with life laid over a history of brutal property ownership in the form of bonded human capital. Thrown into the Low Country mix is a hefty dose of militarism, the Marine Corps Parris Island’s training facility is on the other side of Cowans Reach opposite Fort Fremont built in 1898 during the Spanish American War to protect the deep-water port. Two-and-a-half hours to the west is the Department of Energy’s Savannah River Ecology Lab where Eugene Odum conducted his research into energy exchanges and helped birth the environmental movement.</p>
<p>About six miles up the road from Fort Fremont is Penn Center, a National monument comprising a campus of a few dozen mostly white wooden buildings. Penn Center was among the first freedman’s schools set up by Quaker and Unitarian abolitionists from, where else but Philadelphia? Modeled after Booker T. Washington’s Tuskegee Institute, it offered vocational training to former slaves. As I walked the grounds under the live oak trees past several structures, dilapidated but benefitting from recent infusions of federal money into infrastructure projects, I read about Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s time spent here in the 1960s planning landmark events of the Civil Rights era and couldn’t help but imagine the tentacles of social entrepreneurship woven into the enterprise. If Penn Center were still functioning today would the northern instructors be offering training in coding and bioengineering instead of leather-work and blacksmithing?</p>

<p>It is early summer, and there’s a cool breeze coming off the water. I’m surrounded by Eastern Red Cedar and acres and acres of spartina grass sucking salt out of the brackish water and offering respite for dainty periwinkle snails. To my left, a smaller bridge offers passage to Hunting Island State Park, a sub-tropical maritime forest of towering pines, live oaks, and cabbage palmettos that embrace an 1870s-era cast iron lighthouse and advance right up to the line of dunes, a habitat for protected shorebirds. On the south end of the barrier island is a boneyard beach, a labyrinthine tangle of bleached tree crowns buffeted by the rough surf. Barrier islands are constantly on the move, at the whim of tropical storms and the banal, relentless nudging of the Atlantic. Despite man’s attempts to contain them; they care not for the legalities of waterfront real estate. As the land moves and mature trees fall, soft piney sprouts and prickly palmetto blades emerge to take their place. It is all about cycles – emergence, growth, peak, decline, nourishing the next generation.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>It is morning, and the whir of redwing blackbirds and swallows and the cooing of the mourning doves serenade me as I sip a cup of dandelion tea. Several egrets, their elegant, brilliant white silhouettes punctuate the, decidedly not-magenta, green of this liminal world, standing tall as a mama osprey swoops from her perch of sticks arrayed over a nearby chimney in search of fish for the hatchlings. There is a symphony of life unfolding all around me, as it has for thousands of years. The life of the marsh isn’t governed by man-made time pieces, but by the tides, the moon, a cosmic dance in which the flow of saltwater across the mud guides the antics of fiddler crabs and nourishes the oyster reefs. Here, oscillation is measured by lapping waves, not pendulum swings.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a comment was left on my blog with a link to the proceedings from the, <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Papers-Biomemetic-and-Biohybrid-Systems-Living-Machines-2022.pdf">11th Annual Conference on Living Machines, Biomimetic and Biohybrid Living Systems</a>, held in the summer of 2022 at Case Western University in Cleveland, Ohio. A few days earlier I’d found a website about the EU’s <a href="https://plantoidproject.eu/">Plantoid Project</a>, in which researchers had been theorizing new forms of soft robotics that hijacked the capabilities of root tips to sense environments through distributed cognition. Leo then found <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/soro.2016.0080">a related paper</a> where researchers were modeling robotic “plants” that were designed to “explore” underground soil conditions while “growing” in the direction dictated by sensor mechanisms through the use of autonomous 3D printing. It seems we’re moving closer to self-replicating machines, as long as someone / something is on hand to refill the printer cartridges.</p>
<p>Stephers forwarded me a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/advs.201700931">2018 paper</a> about the merging of biology with soft electronics made of flexible crystalline polymers that aim to sense and regulate electrical signals. I know in my heart that crypto-currencies and smart contracts will be vital to the ongoing coordination of signals for inter-species (where some species are mechanical, artificial “intelligence”) communication – social physics, econophysics – biophysics. Here you see signs warning people to turn off outdoor electrical lights and draw their curtains after dusk, lest baby sea turtles just hatched be distracted by man-made lighting and get lured inland, away from the water that is crucial to their survival. It seems an apt lesson in the potential treachery of electrical engineering.</p>
<p>It’s clear to me that what is unfolding is an attempt, in the name of “sustainability” and “resiliency” to co-opt the wonders of the creator’s cosmic dance and lure biological life into a system of cybernetic circuits. I see the goal as an attempt to craft a globally-networked hybrid superintelligence be controlled by profane forces I do not understand. I hung up the phone a little while ago with Jason, and he, too, expressed incomprehension. Why? What is driving this obscene parody of “intelligence” based in bio-mimicry that can only ever been a shallow approximation of the sophisticated interplay we are graced with, the beauty that is right before our eyes?</p>
<p>As I walk the shady trails of Hunting Park Island, formerly a game preserve shared by plantation owners, urged on by insistent mosquitos the glory of the interconnectedness of these beings in communion with one another cannot be overstated. There are multitudes of conversations arising from the sandy soil. At my feet were countless ant hills, pinecones displaying the mathematical beauty of fractals and Voronoi patterns, a shoreline laced by iridescent seafoam containing biochemical, bacteriological, and fungal elements, the building blocks of life. High above my head were expanses of epiphytes commonly known as Spanish Moss that harmlessly drape from the graceful branches of live oaks, Mother Nature’s own green-gray “neural network” offering countless tiny creatures sustenance and shelter. There was a calling osprey and banks of clouds mirrored by the river.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>For the past few days, I’ve been gifted with the opportunity to have a front row seat on the marsh symphony, even as “real world” mechanical machinations have tugged at the edges of my consciousness. Herve Le Tellier’s “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/03/books/review-anomaly-herve-le-tellier.html">The Anomaly</a>” posits we may be in a simulation, perhaps of the kind dreamed up by the Nvidia and Cesium programmers. I’m not so sure that matters all that much. I know that our soul and spirit extend beyond material reality, which helps when I think of my dad’s mind and my mom’s frailty. What we do with our time, what lessons we learn, how we give thanks, the connections we make (outside the blockchain smart contract protocol layer) is what matters.</p>
<p>This perhaps was a rambling post, and I’ve spent more time on it than I intended. A day out of the sun was probably needed given my fair skin and lack of diligence with the sun block. It’s time to take my mom out for her birthday dinner. On the way to Beauford I’ll drive her past the tomato farms and live oaks and doublewides and ruins of an Anglican church and Penn Center. The people here are fighting off gated golf communities. The signs are all over – preserve Gullah culture. I wish them the best. This corner of South Carolina still feels like an authentic, real place. I’ll go ahead and share some images I took of this special place to give you a feel for it, and maybe you can draw out more of what I was trying to say. A soft-electronics, bio-hybrid system of blockchained micro-payments can’t hold a candle to the magic of a marsh and the time it keeps among the mud and reeds.</p>
<p>PS: My friend and collaborator Cliff Gomes had a fall this week and found himself unexpectedly hospitalized for a hip replacement. He’s strong and healthy and will be fine after having time to mend, but prayers or good wishes sent in his direction would be much appreciated.</p>

In a 1991 BYTE review entitled <a href="https://jonudell.net/archive/citrixFirstImpression.html">Citrix’s New Multiuser OS/2</a> I wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>
That’s how I met <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Iacobucci">Ed Iacobucci</a>. He left Citrix in 2000 to found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DayJet">DayJet</a>, a company that aimed to make real the vision of point-to-point air travel that James Fallows had championed in his book <a href="https://worldcat.org/title/881470297?oclcNum=881470297">Free Flight</a>.</p>
<p>
In 2007 I <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130729204438id_/http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail3278.html">interviewed Ed</a> for IT Conversations. It was one of the most memorable of the podcasts I made for that series.</p>
<p>
Ed died in 2013.</p>
<p>
The other day, Alan Levine <a href="https://cogdogblog.com/2023/05/changing-up-decripting-my-podcast-methods-eh-ai-eh/">pointed me</a> to <a href="https://descript.com">Descript</a>, a new tool for making podcasts with transcripts; it features a technique, first shown to me by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gridinoc">Laurian Gridinoc</a>, that uses <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2022/09/25/curating-the-studs-terkel-archive/">timecoded text as the interface for audio editing</a>. </p>
<p>
I’ve been waiting for that technique to appear in a mainstream podcast production app, so when I heard Descript was doing this I jumped right into a remake of the Ed Iacobucci podcast. It was a remarkable experience in many ways.</p>
<p>
There was no automatic transcription back then, so while I did a few experiments with Mechanical Turk, there were no transcripts of my shows. I uploaded the show’s MP3 file to Descript and it did a fantastic job of speech-to-text, faster and better than anything else I’ve tried. But that was just the start.</p>
<p>
I’m listed as the post-production engineer on that original podcast, which meant I edited the audio for clarity: eliding phrases or sentences, removing ums and likes. Doing that in a waveform editor was laborious to say the least. With Descript I was able to do much more of that kind of editing, better and faster, because text selection as the interface to audio editing is the absolute holy grail. </p>
<p>
But I wasn’t just editing the audio, I was also tuning the transcript at the same time: correcting the recognized text (pretty rarely!), tweaking the auto-generated speaker labels, refining the flow to strike a harmonious balance between the words you hear and the words you read.</p>
<p>
There’s much more to say about Descript, which by the way deployed a significant upgrade in the middle of my project, but for now I’ll just say: Thank you! It’s a brilliant piece of software that enabled me to revisit one of my most treasured conversations and bring it to life in a way that people can now search for and read, as well as hear, with maximum fidelity. DayJet folded in 2008; it was a remarkable tale of innovation; here’s hoping Ed’s dream will come true.</p>
<p>

<p>Phil Windley: Up next on Interviews with Innovators, host Jon Udell talks with Ed Iacobucci, co-founder of Dayjet. Widely known in IT circles as the co-founder of Citrix, he left in 2000 to pursue his interest in aviation. In 2000 he co-founded DayJet, a company whose mission is to deliver on-demand jet travel services.</p>
<p>From IT Conversations. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: I have an ulterior and extremely selfish motivation for having this conversation. So you’ve been to Peterborough when you came to visit us at BYTE. You had to schlep to Manchester and then drive an hour, right?</p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: And getting to Manchester wasn’t even easy coming out of Florida.</p>
<p>Jon Udell: Now, what you probably didn’t know is that 20 miles west of Peterborough is the town I live in, which has a fabulous, and of course completely underutilized regional airport. We have in Keene an airport where we have, I think the third longest runway in the state.</p>
<p> It can land and does occasionally land Air Force One during political seasons. And back when you visited me, at BYTE in the, what was it like the late eighties, early nineties, we had commercial air service out of Keene that was subsidized by the essential air service program of the government. And so I was actually able to drive two minutes to my airport and I could be midtown Manhattan in an hour, quicker than anyone else could get there. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: But I bet it was hard to get to Huntsville, Alabama, though.</p>
<p>You can fix one degree of freedom, but not both. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: At some point I picked up on this emerging air taxi movement and I read the James Fallows book, and I just reread it the other day to prepare for this conversation and I’ve been basically just desperate for this to play out.</p>
<p>I’m just really curious to know, first of all, how you got into this and second of all how it’s going and, and third of all, most importantly for me, cause it’s all about me, you know, when can I be using my own airport again the way I’d like to? </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: (laughs) Well, that’s the objective.</p>
<p> I can’t tell you that we’re gonna achieve it all overnight. It’s one of those frontiers that’s never been properly addressed. You know, I spent most of my career, as you did yours, trying to elevate the computational and communication capabilities that businesses have through systems and networks and such. But one thing that we never really have addressed, on a broad scale, is the same interconnectivity from a physical standpoint. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: And of course architecturally it’s the exact same style, right? </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: It’s an awful lot of similarities.</p>
<p>Jon Udell: Yeah. It’s the peer-to-peer air travel network. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: That’s exactly what it is. I love talking to people that understand what I’m saying when I talk technology. It’s a different world that I’m involved in now, but basically, it is peer-to-peer versus hierarchical networks and all the same issues relating to efficiency and best routing in a dynamic environment.</p>
<p> That’s not the only issues, but those are some of the issues. That’s what attracted me to the project. I think if you remember when I left Citrix, one of the things that I wanted to do other than retire, which lasted about two months, that’s pretty boring actually. Retirement isn’t that’s cracked up to be. One of the things that I wanted to pursue, at least intellectually was where do we go with software as a service? Which remember we started exploring back in the late nineties. And Citrix, obviously that took on a life of its own.</p>
<p>And with ASPs and with a massively interconnected and computationally rich web, you know, one of the things that we’ve always done as technologists is focus on the evolution of infrastructure that people use for delivering things.</p>
<p>But there hasn’t been as much of a focus on vertically integrated, highly specialized systems, which, in many ways we always kind of poo-pooed. I mean, real technologists work on horizontal platforms, you know, kind of a macho attitude. In reality, that’s one step, but every pendulum swings.</p>
<p>And I think that the place where there’s a lot of value that can be added by a lot of smart people is, instead of building a highly horizontal platform that appeals to a lot of people, is go the other end of the spectrum and build a very highly specialized, vertical solution that solves one problem really well and leverage that platform not by making it available to a broad audience, cause almost by definition there isn’t one, but focus on the needs of a fully integrated service delivery. And that’s really what drove me to something that looks so different, like a service industry. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: The appeal of the air taxi idea though, is extremely broad. I mean, initially it’s not going to be something that most people, I guess, will be able to afford. But the idea can go extremely broad, right?</p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: Oh yeah. If we actually dive into the market itself, I like to joke with people, saying that Citrix was a lot of fun, but man, was it hard to explain to people why you’d wanna do remote computing when they didn’t think they needed it.</p>
<p>This on the other hand is the exact opposite. Everybody understands exactly what it is that we’re trying to achieve: seamless point to point travel on a cost efficient basis. And they grasp the concept very quickly, but very seldom do most people think deeply enough in terms of what the complexities are that are behind it, because, as a lot of appealing concepts are, it’s easy to come up with an idea, but it’s really hard to make it real.</p>
<p>A lot of people have had this idea for many, many years. In fact, that’s probably one tha t’s been kicked around for ages, but it’s not until recently — and by recently, I mean, I don’t know, 15 years, 20 years — that we’ve had the kind of tools that you need to really tackle the problem. Not solve it, but just tackle it. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: So let’s go through what the enablers are. Now the Fallows book lays out two broad categories of technological enabler. One is a new generation of general aviation craft, which are smarter, faster, lighter, and safer than what we’ve had, kind of unchanged really, for 30 or 40 years. </p>
<p>So that’s the airplane part of it. And he focuses a lot on that. In fact, a lot of the book is the story of, in particular, Cirrus. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: Sure.</p>
<p>Jon Udell: In parallel with that, and he talks less about it, but I’m hoping that we’ll talk a lot more about it, is this notion that you also have got now this thing called the internet. And one of the things that it can do is make demand visible and aggregate demand. </p>
<p>That if you could go to the internet and put a bid out that says, well, I’m here, and if there’s three or four other people within a 50 mile radius that wanna go to this other place, or various places within a 50 mile radius of some destination, then we can discover one another in a very dynamic way.</p>
<p>That was never conceivable until fairly recently. But I think that you’re talking about also operational routing capabilities. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: There’s a lot of complicating factors and, from a broad brush basis, I agree totally. It’s the hardware and the communications and software, obviously, that all come together. But I mean, at it’s very root, first of all, let’s talk about just general trends. What the real enabler in all this is really what we’ve been doing for 20 years.</p>
<p>It’s Moore’s law, it’s cheap memory and it’s good communications. I mean, that’s really what enables manufacturers to build airplanes better. That’s what essentially the glass cockpits are. I used to joke about it when we first started working on this is that it’s, you know, it’s a thin client.</p>
<p>It’s three pieces of glass up in the front and what used to be individual steam gauges all became applications that run an operating system. It’s highly redundant and, you know, multiple data buses and all sorts of enhancements to guarantee a certain level of reliability but at its core it’s an application running on an operating system. So the IT gains that we’ve made, or the technology gains, I should say, in the last 20 years, come very strongly to play in terms of how these new airplanes are designed.</p>
<p> Now having said that, let me back off for a second and say, I have a slightly different opinion that it’s not necessarily the airplane that’s revolutionary because this is something that I’ve learned in talking to a lot of manufacturers. There’s been a lot of hoopla about, you know, these VLJs (very light jets) are really what’s gonna change the world.</p>
<p> In reality, it isn’t really the airplane. Other than a few things like the integration of information systems, it’s still the same basic laws of physics that come to play. It’s still a wing, it’s two turbo fan engines, it’s one or two pilots. Structurally and aerodynamically it’s not a massive change from what existed before. The cost points are better. The manufacturing advantage that a modern manufacturer can do by intelligently engaging (with the) supply chain. Precision design and manufacturing are incremental improvements. But in the final analysis, a VLJ might give you 10, 20% better capability than a pre-existing design. </p>
<p> The other thing the VLJ lets you do is build volume because, as you’ll soon see, all these models are based on large, dense networks. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: You need a big fleet of taxis for this to make sense.</p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: You can’t do it with one or two, which is traditionally what people have done. And the problem traditionally is when people independently buy and then let out airplanes to the charter world is that they all wind up being personal things that are all different.</p>
<p>And if they’re all different, then you can’t optimize, you can’t do fleet maintenance programs, you can’t scale. So those are all barriers to scaling. So what you need is a large fleet of identical aircraft that are modern, that can be acquired in fleet quantities.</p>
<p>Part of what this revolution’s about, be it a VLJ or turbine or turboprop, I mean, the airplane technology isn’t as important as the fact that you can make them in large quantities. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: And you mean literally identical, or do you mean interoperable and interchangeable? </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: Literally identical. Well, it’s the same thing. From an operations standpoint, we abstract it a little bit and say, as long as they have the same operating characteristics, when you train on one, you can fly any of them. Whereas private aircraft on charter, every one of them is different because they have different instrument sets. </p>
<p>So on the aviation side, airplane design certainly benefited from technology, but it isn’t a revolution. It’s more of a rapid evolution, from a manufacturing standpoint. I think there’s a good shot that, you know, we can start seeing something that looks a little bit more like a revolution in that sense, that you can make a lot of them fast. Be that Honda, be that Eclipse, be that whoever, they’re all gonna wind up in the same place. </p>
<p>But the real revolution, I think, is often missed because it’s least understood. It’s in the business model. You and I have spent a lot of our lives in technology and we’ve seen the effect of creating or identifying new markets, new customers, new value propositions, and how things just spring up outta nowhere.</p>
<p>This is something that’s been part of our lives, our careers. But has not really played out very well , in many industries, one of which is aviation. The core business model of commercial aviation hasn’t changed at all. </p>
<p>They’re scheduled services. You can say they went to hubs and then Southwest did something a little bit less hubby, but it’s all about building a schedule and advertising and getting people to show up. Which is kind of like defining a big freight train that goes around on a schedule and and then you try to reach everybody possible.</p>
<p>And you have big wars in terms of who piles in and how many seats there are. And it’s a fixed market. I like to say, it’s the same one and a half million people that fly from Atlanta or Orlando every year. They fly on different airlines and they all fight each other over who gets the share.</p>
<p>But it’s not a growing market. It’s essentially the same zero sum game. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: And everyone’s going through the same hubs and those hubs are beyond capacity. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: And the charter world, nothing changes. The tax subsidies change from year to year, so it’s more attractive or less attractive for people of means to buy airplanes and then give them to somebody to manage them, to help offset costs.</p>
<p>But it isn’t a fundamental sea change in model. So what we tried to do was kind of abstract that, and I actually had a kind of a false start after I left Citrix. I feel very fortunate that I’ve been able to be in a position where I could actually buy my own airplane which to me, it isn’t so much the luxury of having an aircraft.</p>
<p>It’s really the luxury of being able to schedule your time. That’s really what it’s all about. It has nothing to do with carpeting and entertainment systems or gold plated anything or, cause I’m very down to earth when it comes to that. You know, I travel in blue jeans all the time and t-shirt cause that’s the way I lived most of my life.</p>
<p>Jon Udell: But you go when you go when and where you want. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: But I go when and where I want. That’s the real luxury. And that appeals to everybody. You don’t have to be wealthy to see the value. Everybody has an intrinsic value of time. </p>
<p>So when I first left, I engaged Nancy, my uh, I think when I first left Citrix, we were just married about then, so she was transitioning from fiance to wife, um, to manage our bigger airplanes while I tried to figure out a business plan to make it, you know, like business jets for the masses. And I’ve found out very quickly that that’s a really hard problem because the deck is stacked against you.</p>
<p> The aircraft are extremely expensive. You know, a Challenger 604 is about 25, 26 million new . It’s a very high capital cost. Everything is handbuilt. It’s very high level of service, very customized service. You can’t mass produce it in any reasonable way.</p>
<p> The expectations of the customers are high. The asset utilization’s low. And believe it or not, the competition is incredible because a lot of people have bought airplanes that, throw ’em at the charter to offset costs. So it’s just like all the elements of a crummy business all rolled up in one. And coming right outta software, to me it was a shock to see that this was really such a bad business environment. So basically I hung it up there, I said, nah, I don’t think I wanna spend a lot of time on this.</p>
<p>Then something happened. Two things actually, since you brought it up already. I read Fallows’ book and about the same time I went to Agenda 2001 and Vern Raburn who I knew from years past, most notably from Slate, although he was at Lotus and Symantec also, Vern Raburn was pitching his new sub- million -dollar jet for the masses.</p>
<p>That was his idea. I was skeptical, knowing a little bit about airplanes, but in the same panel we had Dr. Bruce Holmes who was the head of the NASA, well, one of the A’s in NASA is aeronautics, right, it’s not all just space.</p>
<p> He was the chief strategist for the aeronautics, the small airport systems and integration and technology to utilize underutilized assets that we have in our country. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: Just as an aside, for people who haven’t read the book, there’s a subplot about NASA and about Bruce Holmes and about Dan Goldin and about how these guys in a very, kind of underground way, were really seriously trying to figure out how to reinvent air travel and find a way to utilize these 5,000 regional airports that we have around the country.</p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: Which is a huge capital investment that our country’s made.</p>
<p>Jon Udell: Exactly. Exactly. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: And yet we’re still piling everything into 15 major airports. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: Exactly. I think Bruce Holmes is the guy who clocked all of his travel door to door, for a period of years. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: He still does.</p>
<p>Jon Udell: And he found out that …</p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: Bruce works for us now. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: He does? No kidding. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: I hired him this year </p>
<p>Jon Udell: Wow. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: To be our chief strategist for next generation air traffic systems. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: That’s awesome!</p>
<p> So the story is that he clocked all of his trips and he figured out that for anything under 500 miles, it was like just as fast to drive.</p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: Exactly. </p>
<p>Which was, to me was a tremendous epiphany. Of course, we all know that. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: Yeah. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: We just never really actually took the trouble to measure it all. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: Exactly. </p>
<p> So what did he say at Agenda that turned things around for you?</p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: So I went to Agenda, which was as you know, it’s a technology conference, always has been, first and foremost. There’s a panel there, it was about aviation and it was a real oddball panel. They had Fallows, they had Dr. Holmes and they had Vern on the panel. I was already in the middle of trying to investigate how to do aviation. I was on the verge of giving up and I was looking for other things to do. And it dawned on me that what we needed to make point to point travel a reality was a platform. That’s what we were missing. The platforms were big, expensive handbuilt creatures that were bought by very, very wealthy people and, as I said, underutilized expensive assets.</p>
<p>But what we needed was something that was more akin to what the PC was before we had explosions of local area network. So it dawned on me what Vern was saying about his Eclipse –which was still a concept, this was 2001, he hadn’t really built anything yet– was an approach to what he called making the model T of business jets, and in other words, being the first mass produced precision manufactured aircraft.</p>
<p> And so that got me thinking, so I gave Vern and his wife a lift back on our airplane after agenda, back to Albuquerque with Nancy. And we went and took a look at his new facilities and immediately started thinking of software, network operating systems, and so forth. And that set the wheel in motion. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: So when you use the word platform, you are not just referring to the equivalence of the plane to the pc, but you are referring to the software systems that animate that piece hardware. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: In the early days, I looked at the airplane as the pc. I mean, this is kind of oversimplification, but let’s say that the airplane was the mass produced pc, the engines were– originally Williams and then ultimately Pratt and Whitney was the Intel making the thing that had to be mass produced to make these things a reality.</p>
<p> It was incredibly important, high value component. And then I looked at ourselves as some kind of a blend of an operating system/ network operating system/ application that laid on top of all that and it delivered low cost, point to point travel. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: Because that’s what operating systems do is resource utilization. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: Resource management. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: Okay, so we’re getting down to it. Describe what kind of network operating system you are building. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: Okay, so here’s the thing. It didn’t take very long to look at the business models and say if you take a $25 million airplane and replace it with 25 $1 million airplanes, then it fixes a lot of problems. It gives you a lot of robustness in terms of being able to service individual demands. If you couple that also, by the way, with doing it by the seat instead of by the plane. That lets you interleave packets, or payloads. It became very clear that what we need to do is build a very large self optimizing network that would take a lot of other factors into consideration.</p>
<p>Like the physics of the airplane, the temperature, the loads. The beauty of aviation is that it’s like physics meets business. How much you can carry depends on what the temperature is. The altitude, the runway lengths. Safety is all expressed in terms of parameters that you can operate under, right?</p>
<p>But now the optimizer has to take it into account as it starts shuffling around different customers. So it’s not just a straight optimization, it’s an optimization that has to be done very quickly, real time, and it has an incredible number of constraints, many, many more than you would normally have.</p>
<p>So that’s why it’s so important. You have to eliminate all the optional constraints. Like the customers that want black jelly beans. Well they ain’t, they aren’t gonna be our customers. Right. You have to be willing to take any flight. With no special services. Cause special services complicate things.</p>
<p>Jon Udell: But that’s okay. Southwest has found that people are very happy to go along with that idea. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: It’s the same, it’s the same notion. It simplifies, but, but when you’re talking about a real time on demand network, it becomes even more important. So I had to hire mathematicians. I actually had a group of folks that I’d had previous experience with in adaptive compression algorithms.</p>
<p>Really smart guys. We brought them on, gave ’em a challenge of their lifetime and actually for the rest of their lives. The problem is you never find a solution to the problem cause it’s what mathematicians called NP Hard. Which means that you can take every computer on earth that’s ever gonna be manufactured between now and the end of our lives and put it to work on the project til the end of our solar system, and you’re not gonna find the optimal solution. So you have to move from traditional hard optimization into heuristics that are aided by optimization techniques. And so then we brought in Georgia Tech, who I’m alumni of, and I’m on their engineering board, advisory board, brought in the operations research group. And these are really heavy hitter guys that have been doing optimization. Actually, some of ’em were my professors when I was at school, it was funny to see ’em again. These guys did optimization routines for large air carriers. But the difference, the essential differences is in a fixed schedule, there is a fixed schedule.</p>
<p>And optimizing assets around a fixed schedule is a vastly different problem than trying to determine the most optimal solution in real time for something that doesn’t have any fixed schedule and that’s morphing every request that comes in. Basically their response was, nobody’s ever done this, and these are the, you know, smart OR guys, and since then, MIT guys have said the same thing, you know, a lot of people.</p>
<p> It really is a problem that hasn’t been very adequately addressed. So now it looks really exciting for me cause you know, if it was just like chartering airplanes, that is not very exciting. But now we’ve got new science, new math, it’s a lot of green fields in areas that we can get collaboration of some major universities.</p>
<p>Top-notch people want to work and want to assign PhD students to work with us. An opportunity to set up a group of really smart people. And so we did that. And that’s how we got started. And that was the beginnings of the optimization. And the idea is that every reservation that comes in, you have to figure out how how to value these things.</p>
<p>So we have invented a market model where the pricing is based on how you value your time. If you value your time highly, you don’t wanna waste any time at all, you want to say, I’m gonna tell you I’m gonna be there at nine and I’ve gotta be there by 10 :30. And we know that it’s about an hour and a half flight. That’s a very expensive ticket. </p>
<p>But then if you say, I’m willing to leave as early as six in the morning and be there by noon for something that nominally takes an hour, then we can afford to give a very large discount for that seat.</p>
<p> Without knowing whether we’re gonna match anybody up or not. Statistically, we can determine pricing models. And we did that through, uh, I’ll explain in a second another area of science that we have to bring in. But, with that flexible model, that gave us the degrees of freedom that the optimizers could build some really effective schedules. And so then we used Georgia Tech team to do traditional formulations and run what we would determine in real time. They would run it over the weekend on their mesh of computers and determine if they could improve upon it with adding a lot of computational time.</p>
<p>So we’ve kind of determined that our algorithms and heuristics are within 5% or less of what ultimately might be optimal solutions for problems that you can test. Which are smaller problems. I mean, they can’t use the traditional techniques for a typical network because like I said, it’s far too big.</p>
<p>So for problems of, I don’t know, 10 airports and 20 aircraft, or 50 aircraft, they can test our optimality. It doesn’t work for 300 aircraft… </p>
<p>That was half of the problem. I don’t wanna bore you with a lot of details here, so </p>
<p>Jon Udell: It’s not boring, believe me. But feel free to move along.</p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: The other side of the equation was that we also had to knock the problem of mesh and how you parallelize things cause these problems aren’t really well suited to be solved in parallel. So we had to build a strategy around that and build a mesh computing platform and all that stuff. That’s kind of like nuts and bolts, but that went on in parallel. But the big problem that we had then, which was one that had been nagging me from the beginning was, if we really succeed at building a new market, which I believe we are, is, how do I know how many people are gonna use a service that never existed before? Especially if it’s people that maybe hadn’t even flown before. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: Yeah, this is the the web 2.0 problem of, oops, I’m too successful. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: Or, how do you determine what is gonna be successful or not? Cause these are really big asset investment decisions you have to make, you have to lay out airplanes, you have to lay out bases and people, and you have to go places and you have to do marketing investments and, believe me, there’s far more ways you can go bankrupt than there are that you can make money because as it turns out, jump forward a little bit, that these value networks, which is really what we’re building, is a value network between regional points.</p>
<p>The composition of the value network determines the load of the value network. Which is, you know, I guess intuitive to somebody that looks at networks. But from a social standpoint, it’s all the same rules apply. If I have a network of nodes A, B, C, and D and I add E, that could have an impact on all the nodes at their various times of the day.</p>
<p>But if I add F it could have impact some nodes differently than other nodes. So it’s an interrelated loading. A problem that’s very, very difficult to determine. So for that, I thought, you know, we’ve got all these guys that are taking basically chaos and organizing it into order so we can file flight plans and make it all look organized or actually be organized on the back end.</p>
<p>But what I need is another group of people that creates organized chaos or organized complexity that mimics the social behaviors of a region of travelers that can be used to test how well we can reorganize that into order. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: So you mean you need to actually be able to model…</p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: …you need to model the markets and the demand. And that’s not a simple problem either cause it’s gonna depend on pricing and value, time/ value trade offs and density of your transportation network and what nodes you introduce and what the interactions between the nodes are, cause every city has a different effect than others.</p>
<p> For that, I thought, you know, I did study operations research way back when and never really used it heavily, but one of the things I always loved was modeling. And, in fact, before even did Citrix, my other alternative plan was doing something similar to what Maxis did, and that’s built a platform for large scale simulations and never did that.</p>
<p>They did a marvelous job, by the way. I’m thinking the kind of thing that Sim City represented in a generic sense is the kind of technology we wanna bring in. And that happens to be, the modern phraseology for that is complexity science.</p>
<p>When I was at school it was discrete time simulation, but then it got a biological twist to it. And so it became complexity science. At one point in time it was called chaos theory, but complexity science is more, uh, accepted terminology for it. And I had some people that I had done some work with, in fact, through one of my directors , we had both served on the board of a Bios institute in Santa Fe, which was an offshoot of the Santa Fe Institute, which was biological modeling or evolutionary modeling of large complex systems.</p>
<p>So we got in touch with some of those folks, and really, really smart guys that have been doing this all their lives, and we offered ’em a job. We said, Hey, come on board and we’re gonna build the most sophisticated regional traveler model that anybody’s ever built that’s gonna have a great deal of fidelity.</p>
<p>They were gonna use it not just for postulating the future, but actually for building a business. And integrating that as part of our long term planning systems. And so they came on and worked for about four years. And the result was this other piece of technology, which gets married to our system, which is called ABM.</p>
<p>We call it ABM. It’s not very imaginative. It’s agent based model. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: Not anti ballistic missile. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: No, no. And it’s basically, I mean, the simplest way to describe it is, it’s Sim City on steroids. A commercial grade Sim City on steroids. Very targeted on the specific problem of regional travel.</p>
<p> So we’ve got like nine different types of agents or sims that operate and they’re populated according to IRS statistics and 10 square mile zones in the country. And they all have different rules on how they book trips and what flexibility they have. </p>
<p>And then we loaded on top of that a bunch of demographic data. Some we bought, some we got from DOT, some we got from IRS. And then we loaded on top of that all the schedules for all the airlines between all the airports in the contiguous 48. And then we actually developed some driving algorithms so we can estimate driving times. Not great circle, but actual routes and added congestion, time of day congestion through various nodes when driving.</p>
<p>Then we added train schedules and basically had this very sophisticated, very high fidelity model of the transportation options that you would face if you lived in one 10 square mile region of the US and needed to go to another one. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: That’s pretty amazing, that’d be a useful service in and of itself.</p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: Well, the interesting thing is after we started developing that, that’s when we started doing a lot more work with the FAA, DOT, NASA, uh, actually not only Eclipse, but Pratt and Whitney, then GE when they came into the market, and Honda and Embraer. And so, you know, we’re a little startup company, but we’ve pretty much been in the business of trying to plot out the future, and the manufacturers started sending us design specs for power plants and hypothetical airplanes.</p>
<p> We actually found that we had to build some real Chinese firewalls. Cause we were getting all this confidential data from competitors to see how does this airplane design work in loading, you know? So we were able to make some really quantitative assessment. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: Well, this leads into another question I was getting ready to ask, which is that presumably you’re not gonna be the only such service operating on the planet. At some point there comes the need to federate these things, right?</p>
<p> It sounds like this other piece that you’ve built is potentially part of the answer to how you are able to make that happen.</p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: Well, lemme back up one second. One thing that I need to add that’s a complexity or actually a reality check, of this whole thing, that was the biggest curve that we had to handle as we went through this. As a technologist, longtime technologist, I’d like to look at the problem, break down in pieces, and then figure out, in this case, how could we build an ASP service? Or how do we get the federation of this across a bunch of people that are buying assets?</p>
<p>Cause I don’t really wanna buy airplanes and run ’em. But it turns out, interestingly and surprisingly, one of the constraints that we have to live with is the regulatory environment we’re in today. Which winds up being a great, big reality test. You can’t build a business that requires this kind of an investment having in your business plan an assumption that you’re gonna change regulations to make it happen.</p>
<p>There’s no investor in the world that’s gonna invest in that. So one of the constraints we had on our business from the beginning was, this has to operate in the regulatory domain and environment that we have today. We better get pretty darn good at understanding how that works.</p>
<p>So right from the beginning, I started making trips to Washington, meeting with senior FAA folks. Tell them, man, listen, this stuff that NASA’s doing that we want to do in kind of a practical implementation of it, it makes a lot of sense, and we also recognize you can’t change all the rules for something doesn’t exist yet.</p>
<p>So help us understand how we follow the rules so that you can at least not feel like you have to stand in our way. So that turned out to be a long road, a very rewarding road, we built some really good relationships with the regulators. But the punchline is because there is such an interwoven relationship between operating control and safety, it’s very hard to say you own the airplane, you guys over there own the pilots, and we’ll run it. </p>
<p>Almost to play by the rules, you have to vertically integrate across the board. So you have to own the airplanes, hire the crews, train the crews, manage all the concurrency of crews, cause there’s limitations of how much they can fly in a day, a month, a year and all that stuff. So you have to manage, that’s all safety aspects, which can be done. It’s all fairly well understood rules, but you have to kind of integrate the whole thing. </p>
<p>Same with the airplane. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: So you do have to kind of own it for now. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: You have to own it all, from the trip formation, the planning, and you have to do it fast. Because if you’re gonna build a system where 95% of the trips are managed by a computer, instead of vast rooms of human beings doing flight plans, which is non-scalable by the way, then you have to be able to embody all those business and regulatory processes in a system that uses the planning tools, and to develop stuff that conforms. So we wound up building a very vertically integrated company. We used our relationship with Eclipse to put in place a very long term, large scale order for airplanes.</p>
<p>We’re working with other manufacturers as well, but mostly Eclipse right now. This has been a long, long, long road that we’ve had to travel because not only do we have to build the core technology for routing and realtime optimization, but had to develop the market models, had to run market studies to back check the market models to make sure that we’re not inhaling our own exhaust or whatever the right metaphor is, right? We had the regulatory side that we had to develop a relationship over four years, and the culmination of all that is a system that we’re about to launch, and it’s gotten a lot of attention.</p>
<p>I’m trying not to hype it a lot. But it’s one of those things that everybody wants to talk about because it’s such a compelling story. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: We’ve been hearing about it for a long time now, it’s about to get switched on in some form that people can see and experience.</p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: So what this means to you is that you’ll be able to go to that airport, in your community, and be able to say, I need to go to some other airport in my value network. I don’t think it’s the model that says you can fly anywhere you want to fly, everybody flies where they want and it’s totally open.</p>
<p>I don’t think there’s enough scale to make that make business sense, cause there’s economics of flying the airplanes, so you have to focus on what we call day ports, which are kinda like preferred airports where we do the per-seat services between, we’ve identified five and we’re gonna grow that dramatically as we go along based on customer input, actually the reservations that they make themselves tell us a lot about what direction they want to go in. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: So what are those original five non hub airports? </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: They’re all in Florida. Because we wanted to keep it all close by here so we could watch the launch carefully. It’s one in South Florida in Boca Raton, which is between Palm Beach and Fort Lauderdale, basically on the east coast. Lakeland, which is between Orlando and Tampa in the central region. Gainesville, which is where the University of Florida is and the business hub, getting up towards the panhandle, and Tallahassee, state capital, and then Pensacola way out on the panhandle. So it’s kind of like a network that initially spans the center of Florida from the east coast.</p>
<p>Jon Udell: And these are all characteristic of that group of 5,000 airports that Fallows talks about.</p>
<p>The regional, underutilized, you know, you drive up to one and there’s not a parking problem and there’s Cessnas sitting on the runway and stuff.</p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: Absolutely. Two of ’em actually have commercial traffic, but it’s very limited traffic , very limited service I should say. They go mostly through Atlanta, like Tallahassee and Gainesville are the two. To get anywhere else in the network commercially, you go through Atlanta. </p>
<p>The value in this whole thing is saving time, right? I like to say that we’re really not an aviation company or a technology company or a marketing company. We’re in the business of time arbitrage. Some people sell us their time that they don’t need. And we resell it more expensively to other people that can use it. So we use the flexibility one customer has to give , another customer that doesn’t have flexibility a service and aggregate ’em in a way that makes the business make money. </p>
<p>And it comes together. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: When do you switch this thing on? What’s the first day? </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: We actually have started turning on some customers in a controlled fashion. Because what we want to do is guarantee service level. We discovered nobody wants to use this as a business critical service if they’re gonna get rejected frequently . They may not get accepted, you know, the capacity, then we may not be able to find a solution to their request in the prescribed time, which is 10 seconds now, by the way, from the time that you tell us what you wanna do, we’ll tell you whether we can do it or not in 10 seconds. And it’s all done virtually, right? Because there’s no real airplanes, or this is all done in advance. So we have a virtual mapping of what the capacity of the network is. And so we can construct a yea or a nay answer. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: So if you make a promise that you can do it, you don’t necessarily have complete knowledge at that moment about all of the components that are that are gonna satisfy that request, right?</p>
<p>You’re making a bet and, and it’s a good bet. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: Well, it’s more than a bet. We know we can do it. We don’t know with what assets, we know we’ve got 10 virtual airplanes that are gonna be available that day. And we know we’ve made X number of commitments for these windows.</p>
<p>And we know we’ve got the virtual crews. Now the reality of it is, which one is it gonna be and what the sequencing is gonna be, and when we pick you up and drop you off, and what order the airplanes fly around in that’s changing all the time.</p>
<p>And what the load will be and therefore what your profit will or won’t be. </p>
<p>And every request that comes in disrupts the previous schedule, but it gives us an opportunity to find a better schedule. It not schedule. It’s planned basically. Schedule implies that we publish it. We don’t, that’s one of the things we had to do that made this all hard, is to operate under the on-demand rules we couldn’t publish a schedule. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: So that also leads to this other question, which is, I heard Esther Dyson talking about this topic recently, and she said, like you said, it’s really not about the airplanes, it is though an awful lot about the customer experience. What’s your sense of how people react to this highly dynamic environment in which I’m presuming you might get a number of updates as to, well now you’re leaving at such and such time, right? </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: Well that, you know, this is what we’ve been grappling with for the last six months.</p>
<p>We know how to make it work. We know how to scale it. We know how to make the business work, and we know approximately the demand that we’re gonna see because we’ve been investing a lot in developing markets and customers in advance. What we’ve been grappling with is how do we take this basically entirely fluid system… </p>
<p>Jon Udell: …and present it to people…</p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: and present it in a way that people can reliably use it. And what that means is you just add more constraints and in other words, it’s not, you’re not gonna be flipped around all over the place. We start with, essentially, you negotiate as big a window as you can accept because the bigger the window, the cheaper the ticket, right? And it’s not a departure window. It’s a window in which we will complete the mission for you. And you basically have to block that outta your schedule. So if you have a lot of meetings during the day, you’re gonna necessarily be pushed to smaller windows, but that’s okay.</p>
<p>You’re more productive and then may cost a little more. But it allows you to be productive. If you don’t have any hard commitments one way or the other, you can give us a bigger travel window, and then somewhere in there, the flight will be generated.</p>
<p>Now, obviously you can’t say to somebody, you know, you negotiated all morning to get me from A to B, which is maybe an hour flight . People don’t feel comfortable with that, so you have to shrink that down. So then the next challenge operationally is, How do you shrink those windows down over time as you get closer to flight time?</p>
<p>Leaving enough space in the windows for disruption recovery, and not flooding on notifications. So there’s a fine balance and we’re learning that. And really what we’ve discovered is the night before we can crunch it down pretty much.</p>
<p> The big windows are useful for us in the days leading up to the travel because that’s when we’re doing most of our optimizing. When we get right before the day of travel, we can afford to crunch that down pretty far. So we crunch the window down to a much smaller size and we notify the customer the night before, that they have to be at the airport by time X, and they’ll be at their destination by time Y and leaving a little room for wiggling around for us in that. That’s our commitment and it’s a reasonable window, you know? So maybe an hour flight they may have to allocate two hours to get there. Which is far better than driving or anything else.</p>
<p>Jon Udell: Exactly, exactly. It’s like, what’s it compared to? So this is absolutely fascinating, Ed, this is so cool. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: Yeah, it’s fun because it’s like, I feel like we’re kind of inventing a market, not inventing, but we’re pioneering a market and a customer set and it’s all those things that we’ve learned over the years, all packaged up in something that doesn’t look like technology, but it is all about deployment and acceptance of technology. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: Wow. Thank you so much for making the time to do this and congratulations on getting to this point. I know you said it was a long road, but on the other hand, I mean what you’ve done in I think not much more than five years…</p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: right, it’s five years…</p>
<p>Jon Udell: seems like a hell of a lot.</p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: Well, it does when you look back on it, but you know, we’ll see. And the true test is gonna be the customers and I think they’re gonna be happy with it. So we’ll just stay tuned. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: All right. Well, thanks so much, Ed. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: Take care, Jon. </p>
<p>Yeah, you too. </p>

<p>This article looks at implementing an ASP.NET Core application which authenticates using Microsoft Entra External ID for customers (CIAM). The ASP.NET Core authentication is implemented using the Microsoft.Identity.Web Nuget package. The client implements the OpenID Connect code flow with PKCE and a confidential client.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/EntraExternalIdCiam">https://github.com/damienbod/EntraExternalIdCiam</a></p>



<p>Posts in this series</p>



 
 <a href="https://damienbod.com/2023/06/05/asp-net-core-authorization-using-entra-external-id-ciam-and-azure-ad-security-groups/">ASP.NET Core authorization using Entra External ID CIAM and Azure AD security groups</a> 
 



<p>Microsoft Entra External ID for customers (CIAM) is a new Microsoft product for customer (B2C) identity solutions. This has  many changes to the existing Azure AD B2C solution and adopts many of the features from Azure AD. At present, the product is in public preview.</p>



 App registration setup 



<p>As with any Azure AD, Azure AD B2C, Azure AD CIAM application, an Azure App registration is created and used to define the authentication client. The ASP.NET core application is a confidential client and must use a secret or a certificate to authenticate the application as well as the user. </p>



<p>The client authenticates using an OpenID Connect (OIDC) confidential code flow with PKCE. The implicit flow does not need to be activated.</p>







<p></p>



 User flow setup 



<p>In Microsoft Entra External ID for customers (CIAM), the application must be connected to the user flow. In external identities, a new user flow can be created and the application (The Azure app registration) can be added to the user flow. The user flow can be used to define the specific customer authentication requirements. </p>







<p></p>



 ASP.NET Core application 



<p>The ASP.NET Core application is implemented using the Microsoft.Identity.Web Nuget package. The recommended flow for trusted applications is the OpenID Connect confidential code flow with PKCE. This is setup using the AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApp method and also the EnableTokenAcquisitionToCallDownstreamApi method. The CIAM client configuration is read using the json EntraExternalID section.</p>


  services.AddDistributedMemoryCache();

services.AddAuthentication(OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
	.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApp(
		builder.Configuration
			.GetSection("EntraExternalID"))
	.EnableTokenAcquisitionToCallDownstreamApi()
	.AddDistributedTokenCaches();
  


<p>In the appsettings.json, user secrets or the production setup, the client specific configurations are defined. The settings must match the Azure App registration. The SignUpSignInPolicyId is no longer used compared to Azure AD B2C. </p>


  // -- using ciamlogin.com --
"EntraExternalID": {
	"Authority": "https://damienbodciam.ciamlogin.com",
	"ClientId": "0990af2f-c338-484d-b23d-dfef6c65f522",
	"CallbackPath": "/signin-oidc",
	"SignedOutCallbackPath ": "/signout-callback-oidc"
	// "ClientSecret": "--in-user-secrets--"
},
  


 Notes 



<p>I always try to implement user flows for B2C solutions and avoid custom setups as these setups are hard to maintain, expensive to keep updated and hard to migrate when the product is end of life.</p>



<p>Setting up a CIAM client in ASP.NET Core works without problems. CIAM offers many more features but is still missing some essential ones. This product is starting to look really good and will be a great improvement on Azure AD B2C when it is feature complete. </p>



<p>Strong authentication is missing from Microsoft Entra External ID for customers (CIAM) and this makes it hard to test using my Azure AD users. Hopefully FIDO2 and passkeys will get supported soon. See the following link for the supported authentication methods:</p>



<p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/external-identities/customers/concept-supported-features-customers">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/external-identities/customers/concept-supported-features-customers</a></p>



<p></p>



<p>I also require a standard OpenID Connect identity provider (Code flow confidential client with PKCE support) in most of my customer solution rollouts. This is not is supported at present.</p>



<p>With CIAM, new possibilities are also possible for creating single solutions to support both B2B and B2C use cases. Support for Azure security groups and Azure roles in Microsoft Entra External ID for customers (CIAM) is one of the features which makes this possible.</p>

<p>Rule-based, actor model systems are a great match for IoT workloads.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a05cc98-7584-4caa-ba82-41754649a6b1_2904x2214.png">    </a>Temperature Sensor Network Built from Picos <p>Picos are a <a href="https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/overview">rule-based system for programming in the Internet of Things (IoT)</a>. Rules are a good fit for IoT programming because so much of what happens with things is event-based. Events say something happened. They are different from commands (telling) or requests (asking). A sensor might indicate the door opened, a light came on, or the temperature passed some threshold. An actuator might indicate its current status.</p><p>Rules, triggered by an event, determine what should be done to respond to the event. IoT rule-systems use event-condition-action (ECA) rules: when something happens, if this is true, do this. Multiple rules can be triggered by the same event. This allows functionality to be layered on. For example, an event that contains the temperature reported by a sensor might also report the sensor's batter level. One rule that responds to the event can handle the temperature report and another, independent rule can handle the battery level.</p><p>Picos are an actor-model programming system. Actors are a good match for IoT programming using rules. Actors keep state information and respond to events (messages) by changing their state, taking action, and possibly raising other events. Actors provide lock-free concurrency, data isolation, location transparency, and loose coupling. These are great features to have in IoT programming because devices are naturally decentralized, each acting independently.</p><p>Building a functional system usually involves multiple picos each with a number of rules to respond to the events that pico will handle. For example, I recently <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2023/03/monitoring_temperatures_in_a_remote_pump_house_using_lorawan.shtml">built a sensor network using picos for monitoring temperatures in a remote pump house using Lorawan</a>. There is one pico for each sensor and a community sensor that manages them. The temperature sensor pico acts as a digital twin for the sensor.</p><p>As the digital twin, the sensor pico does all the things that the sensor is too low-powered (literally) to do. For example, one rule receives the heartbeat event from the sensor, decodes the payload, stores values, and raises new events with the temperature values. Another rule processes the event with the new values and checks for threshold violations. If one occurs, it raises an event to the sensor community pico. Another rule sees the new value event and takes an action that plots the new value on an external site. And there are others. The point is that rules make it easy to break up the tasks into manageable chunks that can thread execution differently, and concurrently, depending what's happening.</p><p>I've been using picos to program IoT systems for over a decade now. Rule-based, actor model systems are a great match for IoT workloads.</p><p><a href="https://www.technometria.com/p/rule-based-programming-and-the-internet/comments">Leave a comment</a></p>

<p>Hey folks, I’m going to be taking about ten days off to celebrate my mom’s 80th birthday. In the meantime, please check out the videos I made as part of my Camelot Corner series on the Robert F. Kennedy Jr. presidential campaign. The first explores an advisor to the California Chapter of Children’s Health Defense, lawyer Michael Baum who was an un-indicted co-conspirator in Operation Snow White in which covert operatives acting on behalf of Scientology stole records from numerous government offices in the 1970s. I discuss impact finance in the incarceration / recovery space and Crimanon/Narcanon, which relates to an interesting recent development. Bobby announced his vision for creating a “Peace Corps” for low-cost P3 addiction and mental health recovery centers based on the Italian San Patrignano model. In 2021, a Netflix investigative series, SanPa: Sins of the Savior, brought that program back into the public eye.&nbsp; SanPa, which is connected to prominent politicos and oil, finance, and manufacturing interests, practiced coerced labor, physical torture, and even murder. It’s since been rebranded as a “sustainable” social enterprise, offering an efficacious blueprint for “recovery” just in time for mass 4IR economic dispossession and cybernetic social systems engineering with digital behavior tokens.</p>
<p>I also made two presentations focused on the role Charles Eisenstein, advisor to Web3 social impact platform Celo, will be playing to frame out a mythology around Bobby’s “Kennedy Democrat” candidacy. In the first video I explain how the initial phase of “authoritarian government” overreach set the stage for decentralized “tagged” agents exercising a radical, participatory digital “democracy” in a surveilled “commons” using tokens and a language of programmed “community” currency in a new game of noetic emergence. Also featured is the Bretton Woods 75 anniversary event sponsored by Bancor’s Galia Benartzi, Benjamin Netanyahu’s niece by marriage to his third wife Sara. The event, which was held at the historic Mount Washington hotel and featured yoga, storytelling around the campfire, tea ceremonies, and a lively debate over the future of reserve currencies (dollar, yuan, or crypto), was attended by 200 stakeholders from the worlds of global finance, blockchain, and social impact venture philanthropy. Charles gave a keynote presentation on inter-beingness, the death of “Mother Earth,” and the emergence of a new spirit, “Lover Earth,” that comes expecting gifts and is going to be keeping track of donations and withdrawals by humanity (cue distributed ledger technology).</p>
<p>In the second installment, I pulled clips from a podcast Charles and Bobby did last May about the need to move on from the climate / carbon discussion, braiding the strands of eco-Bobby, with health freeDOM Bobby, and now Bitcoin Bobby. I demonstrated the hypocrisy Charles embodies as he calls for the transition to a sacred gift economy, even as he maintains a close affiliation with Celo and Sep Kamvar. Kamvar stays busy tokenizing human and natural capital (see IoT sensors in the slippers of pre-k children enrolled in the Wildflower Montessori franchise he founded while at MIT) and devising novel ways to scale remote sensing and automated measurement for the nature backed currency that Eisenstein proposed in his book “Sacred Economics.” I also laid out my concerns around Kennedy’s proposed recovery Peace Corps models based on my research into impact markets in the addiction space and the problematic history of San Patrignano.</p>
<p>Enjoy your long weekend and see you in a bit!</p>

<p>Co-authored by Stephan Wolf, CEO of GLEIF, and Karla McKenna, Head of Standards for&nbsp;GLEIF.</p><p>In 2014, through its Financial Stability Board (<a href="https://www.fsb.org/">FSB</a>), the <a href="https://www.g20.org/en/">G20</a> carried out one of its decisions from the aftermath of the 2008 Financial Crisis: it formed GLEIF, the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/">Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation</a>. GLEIF is as neutral as can be: it is a Swiss non-profit <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/supranational">supranational</a> entity created by mandate of the G20 and governed by its newly formed Regulatory Oversight Committee; it has no ties to any industry or&nbsp;country.</p><p>There is only one GLEIF and there can only be one GLEIF, formed by the 20 largest countries on Earth to do one thing: manage the issuance of globally unique 20-character identifiers to legal entities anywhere that follow the stringent requirements to get one. But the FSB formed GLEIF only after exploring all other options, and after the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) had already been conceived; GLEIF was created to bring the LEI to the world, not the other way&nbsp;around.</p> Why Create a New Identifier? <p>The inspiration behind the LEI standard is fully captured in the <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1723298">“linchpin” paper</a> written in 2010 by John Bottega and Linda Powell, with contributions from many US and other regulators who would later join the Regulatory Oversight Committee (ROC), formed by the G20 to oversee GLEIF. To understand the many global factors that played into the decision by global regulators to conceive the LEI, and the detailed explanations of why existing identifiers would not be suitable, read that paper. For these reasons the regulatory community asked ISO to create a standard for a Legal Entity Identifier (LEI), and to establish a global business-register-like facility in an open, federated, non-proprietary operating model.</p><p>Instrumental for creating this ISO LEI standard was Karla McKenna, now head of standards for GLEIF. Well before the FSB’s decision to create the Global LEI System, Karla was helping regulators develop the business requirements for the LEI to address vulnerabilities discovered by the FSB’s post-financial crisis investigation. At that time she worked for Citibank, and happened to be the chair of the ISO technical committee responsible for financial standards including the Business Identifier Code (<a href="https://www.swift.com/standards/data-standards/bic-business-identifier-code">BIC</a>). This experience made Karla intimately familiar with the strengths and weaknesses of the BIC and other entity identifiers, and ideally suited to analyze the appropriateness of any system that would satisfy the FSB’s requirements.</p><p>In case it were feasible, it was initially considered for the FSB to adopt and tweak an existing identifier system rather than develop a new one, but the list of requirements made it clear early on that nothing existing would work. That list of requirements, detailed at length in the “linchpin” paper referenced above, included the following:</p>  International standard — the identifier must be an international standard  Unique — no duplicate identifiers  Permanent — identifiers must be permanently registered to their legal entities (also see Persistent below)  Persistent — identifiers and records will not be deleted from the registry; updates in status will be used for identifiers that have been retired, for&nbsp;example  No embedded intelligence — An identifier must not contain any embedded intelligence about the legal entity being identified. For example, embedding another identifier that identifies the legal entity within an identifier is not permitted. Identification is referential using the identifier reference data&nbsp;records.  Freely accessible — there must be no costs to data users, no licensing required, and no restrictions on copying, publishing, distributing, transmitting, citing or adapting identifiers and associated reference data.  <p>One by one these requirements eliminated existing identifier systems from consideration, and with Karla’s research and assistance the decision to develop a new kind of legal entity identifier was confirmed by the FSB, and the LEI — and GLEIF to manage it — were&nbsp;born.</p> LEI Adoption <p>GLEIF’s mandate from the FSB was straightforward:</p>  Develop an international standard (<a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/about-lei/iso-17442-the-lei-code-structure">ISO 17442</a>) for strongly verifying the existence and primary attributes of legal entities in any jurisdiction in the&nbsp;world;  Enlist Local Operating Units (LOUs) throughout the world to perform the standardized vetting process for a nominal fee (there’s now 40 LOUs globally, GLEIF itself does not perform the vetting, they just manage the&nbsp;rules);  Use the LOUs to issue a globally unique 20-character <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/about-lei/introducing-the-legal-entity-identifier-lei">Legal Entity Identifier</a> (LEI) to legal entities who are successfully vetted;  Maintain a free, publicly available registry of all LEI holders’ records that follows the requirements above, a veritable ‘registry of registries’.  <p>Any legal entity that pays the annual fee — which varies, it’s set by each Local Operating Unit and not mandated — will have their primary attributes strongly vetted: legal name, address, jurisdiction, and parent-child relationships to other legal entities. The result is the issuance of an LEI, a rigorous, standardized, neutral, globally acceptable legal entity identifier.</p><p>Here are some examples:</p><p>JP Morgan Chase Bank: <a href="https://search.gleif.org/#/record/8I5DZWZKVSZI1NUHU748">8I5DZWZKVSZI1NUHU748</a></p><p>Coca Cola: <a href="https://search.gleif.org/#/record/UWJKFUJFZ02DKWI3RY53">UWJKFUJFZ02DKWI3RY53</a></p><p>Halifax Hospital Medical Center: <a href="https://search.gleif.org/#/record/549300H6HDJUXLEMUW23">549300H6HDJUXLEMUW23</a></p><p>The Glen at Hiland Meadows: <a href="https://search.gleif.org/#/record/5493000F7PSK3TI9IH08">5493000F7PSK3TI9IH08</a></p><p>State of Washington: <a href="https://search.gleif.org/#/record/549300X3TODFMUKLQ364">549300X3TODFMUKLQ364</a></p><p>Bank of China: <a href="https://search.gleif.org/#/record/549300KIPGRYLXDQDD87">549300KIPGRYLXDQDD87</a></p><p>Dominos Pizza Australia: <a href="https://search.gleif.org/#/record/54930034RFI409JZ3179">54930034RFI409JZ3179</a></p><p>African Development Fund: <a href="https://search.gleif.org/#/record/549300GT4BDQ5463KW73">549300GT4BDQ5463KW73</a></p><p>United Nations: <a href="https://search.gleif.org/#/record/549300HYGYJKXU2J8X74">549300HYGYJKXU2J8X74</a></p><p>LEI adoption is accelerating. LEIs are now <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/lei-solutions/regulatory-use-of-the-lei">used</a> in the financial sector in every industrialized country, with rapidly growing adoption in other industries and global trade. An LEI is now <a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/library/esma74-362-388_lei_statement_sftr.pdf">required</a> for any company to be listed on any EU stock exchange, regardless of industry. 2.3 million LEIs have been issued so&nbsp;far.</p> The vLEI: Binding Flesh-to-Digital <p>The LEI is not an ‘authenticator’ or ‘authorizer’, it’s just a 20-character alphanumeric string. An LEI tells you precisely which organization someone claims to represent, but alone provides no way to verify that claim. An LEI is like a Social Security Number, birthday, or any other number that can be easily written onto a piece of paper: the binding between the identifier and the individual presenting it must be verified separately and manually.</p><p>Many governments globally try to solve this for citizens with unique ID cards equipped with a RFI-ready chip. This way a natural person could prove his/her existence and identity across many boundaries, but this is not possible for legal entities; national ID cards for citizens do not convey the binding between an entity and its representatives, and neither does any form of identity in the digital realm. Online or offline, you could prove that Steve Smith is Steve Smith, but not that he works for ACME Inc. or that he’s the CFO, authorized to sign financial statements on behalf of&nbsp;ACME.</p><p>For this reason GLEIF developed the “verifiable LEI” or “vLEI” using verifiable credentials and other open standards: to create a verifiable binding between an organization and its representatives, binding flesh to digital. When first learning of the vLEI some think that an entity that has an LEI can somehow now prove its existence, but that is only partly true; the vLEI is actually a verifiable credential that must be held by a person, a human being, because entities can act only through&nbsp;people.</p><p>We’ve found this point to be confusing to people, so we’ll say it again a different way: when a legal entity is required to make a regulatory filing, for example, it has no way to act for itself to make the filing, some human with authority must attest to its validity. Even if a submission process is automated, any filing with a regulator must be accountably signed by someone with the requisite authority. Organizations don’t make calls, send messages, or make statements; ultimately, people with authority to represent the organization do those things, or they don’t happen. Imagine the absurd opposite, a CEO saying, “I had no idea, none of us humans knew a thing about it, the company just did it by&nbsp;itself.”</p><p>Simply put, organizations can’t act for themselves, people act on an organization’s behalf, as representatives, and the vLEI makes it globally provable when they do, for the first&nbsp;time.</p> Decentralized Organizational Identity and Verifiable Authority <p>The vLEI acts as a first or root-level “organizational credential” (OC) for an entity, provably binding top-level authorized representatives to the legal entity. This first OC forms the basis of Decentralized Organizational Identity (OI), as now the organization has the power to delegate credentials and authority throughout the organization, enabling every authorized person (or thing) to prove the scope of their authority in the digital realm anywhere they please, inside or outside the organization’s boundaries.</p><p>Never before has it been possible for representatives of an organization to do this. The recent advent of verifiable credentials in the world of decentralized identity first made it possible for data to be portable across digital boundaries, and now the LEI and vLEI take that breakthrough capability and use it to convey a provable line of authority, from any representative back through unlimited levels of delegation all the way to the legal entity&nbsp;itself.</p><p>We call it “verifiable authority”. It’s gonna be&nbsp;big.</p><p>To learn more, see “<a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/the-dawn-of-decentralized-organizational-identity-part-1-identifiers-ffb9091fd47a">The Dawn of Decentralized Organizational Identity, Part 1: Identifiers</a>.”</p>

<p>
I’d been needing to refactor the pagination logic in the <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-mastodon">Mastodon plugin</a> for <a href="https://steampipe.io">Steampipe</a>. After a couple of abortive tries, I took another run at it this week with the help of the latest generation of LLM-powered coding assistants.</p>
<p>
Here was the problem. The pre-release version of the plugin consolidated pagination for many tables in one place. That was a good thing, but the downside was that there was only one Steampipe table which represented what should have been many of them. So you could say select * from mastodon_timeline but then you had qualify with where timeline = 'home' or where timeline = 'local' and so on. For a user of the plugin this was awkward, you’d rather say select * from mastodon_timeline_home or select * from mastodon_timeline_local, and reserve the where clause for more specific purposes. The v1 plugin made separate tables, but duplicated the pagination logic on a per-table basis. It worked, and was good enough to ship the plugin in time to demo at <a href="https://fediforum.org/2023-03/">FediForum</a>, but it obviously needed improvement. </p>
 ChatGPT-4 and Sourcegraph Cody 
<p>
Since then, Sourcegraph has released its new coding assistant, <a href="https://sourcegraph.com/cody">Cody</a>, which you can run as a VSCode extension or on sourcegraph.com. This set up the possibility for an interesting comparison. ChatGPT-4 builds on OpenAI’s LLM; Sourcegraph’s Cody, on the other hand, uses Anthropic’s <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/index/introducing-claude">Claude</a>.</p>
<p>
Another key difference is that ChatGPT only has the context you paste into it. Cody, sitting inside VSCode, can see your repository and has all that context. And if you index your repo, which is something Sourcegraph are willing to do for beta users on request, then Cody has access to what are called <a href="https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/cody-is-cheating#sourcegraph-platform-101">embeddings</a> that represent the structure of your code in various ways. These embeddings, according to Sourcegraph, can powerfully enhance your LLM prompts. Even without embeddings, Cody offers quite a range of assistance, from a high-level overview of what your repo does to line-level improvement. It’s all packaged, in the extension, as a set of recipes behind buttons with names like Explain selected code, Improve variable names, and Smell code. I haven’t yet used these recipes enough to form solid opinions, though. For this exercise I used Cody mostly in a ChatGPT-like conversational way. In that mode, it’s wonderful to be able to select the code you want to talk about, instead of pasting it into the chat.</p>
<p>
In both cases, as should be no surprise, it wasn’t enough to just ask the tools to consolidate the pagination logic. They were perfectly happy to propose solutions that could never work and might not even compile. So I began with a simpler version of the problem. Mastodon uses the same pagination machinery for APIs that return arrays of different kinds of results: Statuses (toots), Accounts, and Notifications. By focusing on these separately I reduced the duplicate pagination from 13 instances to three. Then, in a separate pass, I worked out how to collapse those into a single paginate function that accepted one of three data-fetching function parameters.</p>
<p>
I tried to pay careful attention to prompts and completions as I went along, but in the heat of the action I didn’t do a great job of that, partly because I was switching back and forth between the two tools. But I’m quite happy with the result. There was one key insight in particular which, fascinatingly, I am hard pressed to assign credit for. Was it me or one of the assistants? I think it was me, but in a way that doesn’t matter, and isn’t the point of this story.</p>
 The key insight 
<p>
Here was the insight. When I was building the transitional paginateStatus function, the first attempt returned results to the calling code in each table’s List function, which was responsible for streaming the data to Steampipe. This led to a series of detours to work around the problem that the returned data could be quite large, and chew up a lot of memory. That could probably be solved with a goroutine that would stream results back to the caller, instead of returning them as a batch. I tried prodding both LLMs to come up with that kind of solution, had no luck with several tries in both cases, but then came the insight. The helper functions could stream results directly to Steampipe, and just return nil or err to the calling List function. </p>
<p>
With that dramatic simplication I was able to complete the phase 1 refactoring, which yielded three pagination functions: paginateStatus, paginateAccount, and paginateNotification. Phase 2, which consolidated those into a single paginate function, was a bit more prosaic. I did need some help understanding how the necessary switch statements could switch on the timeline types passed into the paginate function. Both assistants had seen lots of examples of this pattern, and both helpfully augmented my imperfect knowledge of golang idioms.</p>
 Partnering with machine intelligence 
<p>
I came away with a profound sense that the real value of these assistants isn’t any particular piece of code that they get “right” or “wrong” but rather the process of collaborating with them. When you’re working alone, you have an ongoing conversation with yourself, usually in your own head. The point of talking to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">rubber duck</a> is to voice that conversation so you can more effectively reason about it. Externalizing your thinking in that way is intrinsically valuable. But when the rubber duck talks back, it’s a whole new game. As Garry Kasparov <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/07/11/working-with-intelligent-machines/">famously wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The winner was revealed to be not a grandmaster with a state-of-the-art PC but a pair of amateur American chess players using three computers at the same time. Their skill at manipulating and coaching their computers to look very deeply into positions effectively counteracted the superior chess understanding of their grandmaster opponents and the greater computational power of other participants. Weak human + machine + better process was superior to a strong computer alone and, more remarkably, superior to a strong human + machine + inferior process.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
I’m not worried about robot overlords. Instead, I look forward to collaborating with robot partners.</p>

 The Dawn of Organizational Identity, Part 1: Identifiers <p>Thanks to Stephan Wolf, CEO of GLEIF, who co-authored this article, and to Karla McKenna, Managing Director at GLEIF Americas, who contributed significantly, and to dozens of other smart people who contributed their time and insights.</p> Organizational Identity (OI)&nbsp;Defined: <p>The ability of a person or thing to prove their authority to represent an organization outside the boundaries of that organization.</p><p>We would add “without using identity providers, blockchains, or proprietary/shared platforms”, but it is still possible to accomplish OI using those things (just not as well). OI is powered by the breakthroughs of second-generation verifiable credentials (VCs), described in <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/the-dawn-of-decentralized-organizational-identity-part-2-organizational-credentials-d8baf5fd9114">Part&nbsp;2</a>.</p><p>OI is ultimately about “verifiable authority”, also described in <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/the-dawn-of-decentralized-organizational-identity-part-2-organizational-credentials-d8baf5fd9114">Part&nbsp;2</a>.</p> A Glimpse Into the&nbsp;Future <p>When the authority of a person or thing claiming it can be instantly verified, whether in the physical or digital realm, the world will be different…</p>  The authenticity of any digital document, agreement, purchase order, filing, or other piece of data will be instantly verifiable;  Phone calls, texts, email, and other digital communications originating from authorized representatives (or devices) of an organization — or any delegate from that organization — will be instantly verifiable;  Some documents will prevent signing and some systems won’t be accessible without the expected authority (a parallel to access control&nbsp;lists);  The authority of every approval, signature, or other digital action in a supply chain will be instantly verifiable by downstream actors, and irrefutably auditable in real-time;  Authority will be verified before identity in most interactions, and identity not at all in&nbsp;many;  <p>The examples above are B2B, but verifiable authority is equally beneficial B2C:</p>  Legitimate AI/bots will prove legitimacy by digitally signing all content they&nbsp;produce;  Phishing will become more rare and difficult for fraudsters, as proving authority becomes nearly impossible for impersonators;  Citizens and customers will use digital credentials rather than passwords to login to government and industry, and will be instantly authenticated when they call in, walk in, or&nbsp;login;  Secure, private, decentralized peer-to-peer messaging that’s more secure than Signal will replace most email and phone calls between individuals and organizations (or their operators/delegates), with each side using the messaging platform of their&nbsp;choice;  Irrefutable digital receipts will become ubiquitous;  A car (and its driver) will wirelessly verify the authority of approaching law enforcement or emergency vehicles;  <p>And on and on, limited only by one’s imagination. To put it simply: soon any person or thing will be able to prove the scope of their authority to represent an organization — anywhere — and it will be instant, expected, and commonplace.</p><p>And importantly, this future doesn’t require intermediaries: ‘identity providers’ (IDPs), blockchains, proprietary platforms, or shared platforms. Like email, we’ll need services that we can build ourselves or buy from someone else, but everyone will make this choice for themselves, without the need for or involvement of ‘trusted’ or ‘shared’ intermediaries.</p> Why People and&nbsp;Things? <p>If this new market category is called organizational identity, why is the definition about people and&nbsp;things?</p><p>Because organizations don’t act, people and things do (and that includes AI and&nbsp;bots).</p><p>Organizations don’t enter into agreements, send messages, make filings… people and things do, as authorized representatives for an organization. Imagine a CEO saying: “None of us did that, we didn’t know a thing about it, the company did that.” It’s nonsensical. People derive authority from an organization’s founding documents, then they delegate and use that authority. The organization may not disclose which representatives authorized a particular action, which makes it appear like the organization acted for itself, but there is always someone whose authority is responsible for the&nbsp;action.</p><p>With OI, an org’s representatives will be able to instantly prove that authority anywhere, no matter how many levels deep in the organization they may&nbsp;be.</p><p>Of course the first aspect of organizational identity (OI) is literally the identity of the organization, but that’s just the beginning; the thing that justifies OI as an important new category of digital identity is that it’s now possible to instantly verify the authority of an organization’s representatives outside the boundaries of the organization, which simply wasn’t possible until recently with the advent of verifiable credentials (VCs).</p><p>And OI is predicated on knowing precisely for which organization authority is being claimed, which is not as easy as it sounds. More on that&nbsp;later.</p> Why Only Legal Entities? <p>Many kinds of organizations may not technically be legal entities but are fully capable of being uniquely identified and issuing verifiable credentials to their members. These include government organizations, clubs, associations, syndicates, NGOs, mutual funds, tribes, family offices, and other groups that may not have legal status but are organizations in the truest sense of the&nbsp;word.</p><p>However… the problem with extending the definition of OI to include non-legal entities comes when attempting to verify a credential they’ve issued: until some vetting resource exists that can strongly attest to the existence of a non-legal organization to help verifiers differentiate it from imposters — like proxy identifiers do for legal entities globally, described in detail further down — we see no way for a verifier to be sure that an issued credential came from the organization claimed.</p><p>Until that time, OI — and the verifiable authority it enables — should be limited to strongly vetted legal entities.</p> Why Now? <p>Organizations and their representatives have existed for centuries, so why is now the ‘dawn’ of organizational identity?</p><p>It’s one thing to claim to represent an organization, quite another to prove it. Being ‘digital’ is not enough; many things are digital today but we still don’t have “B2B ID”, a way for representatives from one organization to instantly verify the digital claims, signatures, messages or other digital objects from another. We don’t have “B2C ID” either, where people can verify representatives of organizations rather than just the other way around. This ‘verifiable authority’ is now feasible through the use of organizational credentials (OCs), described in <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/the-dawn-of-decentralized-organizational-identity-part-2-organizational-credentials-d8baf5fd9114">Part&nbsp;2</a>.</p><p>But first things first: before authority can be strongly verified, its source must first be strongly identified; it does no good to prove representation of an organization without first uniquely identifying who that organization is.</p> Organizational Identity (OI) Components <p>OI has two components:</p>  Unique identifiers for the org and its representatives (described here, in Part&nbsp;1);  Authority credentials for representatives (described later, in <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/the-dawn-of-decentralized-organizational-identity-part-2-organizational-credentials-d8baf5fd9114">Part&nbsp;2</a>).  <p>The first component, Identifiers, includes two&nbsp;kinds:</p>  Legal Entity Identifier — An unambiguous and unique identifier of a legal entity externally assigned after a rigorous vetting&nbsp;process.  Unique Identifiers for Individual Representatives — Unique (within the entity) internally assigned identifiers for representatives.  <p>From this foundation of identifiers, Organizational Credentials (OCs) are now possible. OCs are what bring OI to life in the digital (and sometimes physical) realm: they’re how an organization’s representatives can instantly and digitally prove their authority to act on its&nbsp;behalf.</p> Strongly Vetted Legal Entity&nbsp;Identity <p>The first type of identifier — for the legal entity — is straightforward: it is a unique, unambiguous, usually alphanumeric identifier resulting from the strong vetting of an organization legally established somewhere in the world. It can be globally unique if it is a “proxy” identifier (described below) or it may be nationally or regionally unique if it is an “official” identifier, but in either case it must be strongly&nbsp;vetted.</p><p>Why? Because if the vetting isn’t done in a reliably consistent and rigorous manner, we cannot be sure, especially in the digital realm, that we’re dealing with the entity we think we are. And if a regionally unique identifier attempts to be used nationally or internationally, we could run into the same&nbsp;problem.</p> “Official” and “Proxy” Entity Identifiers <p>There are two types of legal entity identifiers: official and&nbsp;proxy.</p><p>Official identifiers are issued and required by government and cannot be replaced or substituted. These are the official identifiers entities need to pay taxes, register for programs, make regulatory filings, and so on. They are issued either regionally or nationally and are unique within the scope of their issuance, but may not be globally unique as they aren’t required to&nbsp;be.</p><p>Though required for use for official purposes, official identifiers can be problematic for use outside their intended scope, for several&nbsp;reasons:</p>  They may not be&nbsp;unique;  They do not cover all types of legal entities;  The associated data may not be current (moves, mergers, name changes,&nbsp;etc.);  There are over 1,000 official registries around the world, it can be difficult to know which one to verify&nbsp;against;  Each registry comes with own allocation rules (not consistent);  Records are in local language, making it difficult to use them in cross-border scenarios;  Not all official registries have strong tools for accessing their&nbsp;data;  Some registries charge for data&nbsp;access;  Multiple registries may have conflicting data for the same&nbsp;entity.  <p>Proxy identifiers are additional identifiers issued from reputable issuers for a given purpose (see the next section for a list of top issuers and purposes). Proxy identifiers may confirm and utilize data found in official, publicly available registries, but also may rely on self-attested data, depending on the purpose. Proxy identifiers are intended to be globally unique, unambiguous and useful across both regional and national&nbsp;borders.</p><p>Proxy identifiers are not official or authoritative; unlike official identifiers there is no authority behind them that can levy taxes or penalties or impose legal or regulatory requirements on the entity. Proxy identifiers are reference identifiers, enabling their users to uniquely refer to a particular entity within their intended purpose, though some proxy identifiers are required by regulators in specific industries, such as the BIC in banking, the GLN in supply chain, the TIN in customs, and the LEI in financial transactions.</p> Global Proxy Entity Identifier Registries <p>There are many regional and national official identifier registries, but only a few proxy identifier systems attempt global scale. This is where proxy identifiers really shine, each with a distinct makeup and purpose appropriate for how it’s&nbsp;used:</p><p><a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/about-lei/introducing-the-legal-entity-identifier-lei">Legal Entity Identifier</a> (LEI), <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/75998.html">ISO 17442</a>, managed by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gleif.org/">GLEIF</a></p>  Purpose: strongly, consistently vet and uniquely identify legal entities in all jurisdictions that can participate in financial transactions and international trade  <p><a href="https://www.gs1.org/standards/id-keys/gln">Global Location Number</a> (GLN), <a href="https://www.gs1.org/standards/gs1-application-standard-usage-isoiec-6523-international-code-designator-icd-0209/current-standard">ISO 6523</a>, managed by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gs1.org/">GS1</a></p>  Purpose: uniquely identify physical locations, operational locations, legal entities, and business functions primarily in supply chain and international trade  <p><a href="https://www.dnb.com/duns.html">Data Universal Numbering System</a> (DUNS), managed by <a href="https://www.dnb.com/">Dun &amp; Bradstreet</a></p>  Purpose: for businesses associated with a D&amp;B Live Business Identity (proprietary) for evaluation of the credit-worthiness  <p><a href="https://www.swift.com/standards/data-standards/bic-business-identifier-code">Business Identifier Code</a> (BIC), <a href="https://www.iso9362.org/">ISO 9362</a>, managed by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.swift.com/">SWIFT</a></p>  Purpose: addressing messages, routing business transactions and identifying business parties — “operations parties”, not necessarily legal entities — primarily in financial transaction messaging  <p><a href="https://www.wcoomd.org/-/media/wco/public/global/pdf/topics/facilitation/instruments-and-tools/tools/trader-identification-number/guidelines-on-trader-identification-number.pdf">Trader Identification Number</a> (TIN), managed by the <a href="https://www.wcoomd.org/">World Customs Organization</a></p>  Purpose: to uniquely identify exporters/economic operators in a country (the TIN uses official national identifiers as a prefix for uniqueness)   One of These is Not Like the Others: GLEIF’s&nbsp;LEI  Unique in&nbsp;Purpose <p>Each of these identifiers is useful for precisely the purpose it was designed, but the LEI is best suited as a root of trust for Organizational Identity because it is focused exclusively on the core attribute necessary to make Organizational Credentials authoritative: legal authority.</p><p>That is not a knock against other proxy identifiers, they are suited well for their stated purposes, but GLEIF’s purpose is directly aligned with the needs of OI: all legal entities that can participate in financial transactions — nothing more, nothing&nbsp;less.</p> Unique in Structure <p>GLEIF does not and has not issued any of the 2.3 million issued LEIs; they’ve all been issued by independent <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/about-lei/get-an-lei-find-lei-issuing-organizations/">Local Operating Units</a> (LOUs) who typically offer other, often adjacent products and services. GLEIF collects all LEIs and associated data from the LOUs, the decentralized origin of LEI data who must also publish it on their websites.</p><p>GLEIF is closer to a standards body, a keeper of the rigorous, detailed rules by which entities must be vetted before an LOU can issue an LEI to a legal&nbsp;entity.</p> Unique in Transparency <p>All LEI data for all 2.3 million issued LEIs is <a href="https://search.gleif.org/#/search/">publicly available</a> and can be used for any purpose and without the need to inform GLEIF, free of any copyright or intellectual property restrictions. The data is also available barrier-free on the GLEIF website as complete files or via&nbsp;API.</p><p>GLEIF also publishes two other critical things: the rules for entity vetting and the processes for maintaining data quality over time. Without published rules for entity vetting — which we’ve been so far unable to find for other proxy entity identifier systems — it would be unknown how it’s done or to what standard of rigor. GLEIF’s independent Local Operating Units (LOUs) are measured on how well they adhere to these published rules and are accredited for compliance, with the results aggregated into published data quality&nbsp;reports.</p><p>GLEIF also publishes 3,250+ forms (types) of legal entities in over 175 jurisdictions. The <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/about-lei/code-lists/iso-20275-entity-legal-forms-code-list#">list</a> contains legal forms/types in their native language, such as limited liability companies (Ltd), Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung (GmbH) or Société Anonyme&nbsp;(SA).</p> GLEIF Has No Authority Over&nbsp;Entities <p>As with all proxy identifiers, GLEIF has no authority to create, change, or influence any legal entities; it has authority only over its own LOUs and Qualified vLEI Issuers (QVIs). Regulatory or other authorities can and often do require LEIs for legal entities under their purview, but that is completely independent of&nbsp;GLEIF.</p><p>When an LEI is obtained by an entity, it is literally owned by that entity, permanently; it may be listed as ‘lapsed’ if the associated data is not annually maintained, but it will never be recycled and it cannot be revoked, by mandated the rules of the Regulatory Oversight Committee, which was formed by the G20 to oversee GLEIF. Owning an LEI does not give an organization any additional authority, it simply represents an attestation from a credible third party that their legal entity&nbsp;exists.</p><p>In contrast, identifiers issued by state-controlled authorities have all the power and authority of the government, from legal existence to taxes to rules of operation and&nbsp;more.</p> Unique In Neutrality <p>GLEIF is neutral, it favors no country, no industry, no company — it is the ‘Switzerland’ of proxy identifier systems, literally headquartered in Switzerland — and well suited as a foundational and globally acceptable root of trust for Organizational Identity.</p> Unique in Decentralization <p>Anyone familiar with cryptocurrencies and other Web3 innovations — NFTs, smart contracts, DAOs, blockchains — has undoubtedly heard a lot about the ideal of decentralization: the diluting of authority from one central actor to many participants in a given&nbsp;system.</p><p>The key word here is “authority”.</p><p>If LEIs conveyed or imbued some kind of authority, then it mIght be considered antithetical to the goals of decentralization; but LEIs are referencial, not authoritative. As mentioned above, GLEIF has no authority over any entity that has an LEI; it is simply a third-party attester that an entity exists, similar to how <a href="https://onfido.com/">Onfido</a> or <a href="https://www.jumio.com/">Jumio</a> vets identity for individuals, albeit a globally credible one by virtue of its neutral standing as a Swiss non-profit creation of the&nbsp;G20.</p><p>Actual authority begins not with GLEIF but with the entity’s own top-level representatives. Tracing an OC (Organizational Credential) back to an LEI simply references from which entity authority is derived, whose authority to exist comes from the state or province of registration, not from a third party like GLEIF who looks at the official government registry after registration has already occurred.</p><p>(Going forward, for simplicity we will refer only to the LEI, though other proxy or official identifiers may be used. Learn more about the unique short history of GLEIF and current LEI adoption in a separate post,&nbsp;<a href="https://rufftimo.medium.com/the-unique-short-history-of-the-lei-3af37b39ad69">here</a>.)</p> Unique Identifiers for Representatives  Who is&nbsp;It? <p>Now that we’ve identified the legal entity, we must also uniquely identify its vessels of authority: its representatives. These are the people (and things) authorized to represent the organization in interactions and transactions with others, such as entering into a contract, authorizing a payment, servicing a customer or constituent, declaring goods and services, and&nbsp;more.</p> How Unique? <p>Unique identifiers for representatives can be as simple as a name (e.g., “Steve Smith”) or as sophisticated as a digital identity number or code conferred under legal terms by government: eIDAS certificates in Europe, SingPass in Singapore, Aadhaar card in India, ICN or Identificação Civil Nacional in Brazil, and many&nbsp;more.</p><p>“Unique” is relative to what an organization requires. A person’s given name is a semi-unique identifier meant initially to be unique only within a family, and is usually unique enough within small companies. Uniqueness is also achieved with combinations of identifiers like name and number, name and title, multiple numbers, etc. ‘Unique’ may also have a time constraint: what is unique today might not have been in the past or will be in the future, a trait called “unambiguous”, which may or may not be required depending on the use&nbsp;case.</p><p>When the authorized representative is an inanimate object or location, such as an AI bot or process on a server, the GLN, GTIN and other identifiers from the GS1 family of identifiers have no equal. GS1 is the originator and global administrator of <a href="https://www.gs1.org/standards/barcodes">bar codes</a>, used to uniquely identify products worldwide. Over 2 million companies utilize GS1 Standards and 100 million products carry GS1 barcodes. When combined with the verifiable LEI or “vLEI”, GS1 identifiers could form a powerful global root of trust for cryptographically verifying both the provenance and authority of any person or thing representing or produced by an organization.</p> Identifiers Don’t Prove&nbsp;Anything <p>Identifiers are not ‘authenticators’ or ‘authorizers’, they’re just alphanumeric strings. Unique identifiers tell you precisely who or what someone or something claims to be, but alone provide no way to verify the authenticity of the claim. A hierarchical chain of identifiers is also no more verifiable than a lone identifier, though it does provide more information: a claim of a relationship between&nbsp;them.</p><p>Alone, the LEI and GLN are identifiers like Social Security Numbers, birthdays, or any other number that can be easily written onto a piece of paper: they must be verified separately and manually (when they must be verified at all, which is not always the case in physical&nbsp;space).</p> Binding People to&nbsp;Entities <p>Many governments globally provide strong identity binding for citizens with unique ID cards equipped with a RFI-ready chip. This way a natural person could prove his/her identity across many boundaries, but they cannot prove authority; national ID cards do not convey any bindings between entities and their representatives. For example, you could prove that Steve Smith is Steve Smith, but not that he works for ACME Inc. or that he’s the CFO, authorized to sign financial statements on behalf of the organization.</p><p>An easily verifiable binding between actor, action, and authority is a serious need for many use cases in physical space, but a critical need in cyberspace for B2B and B2C interactions if we want to end the too-easy impersonation of organizational representatives by fraudsters who steal billions annually. We also need to speed up or eliminate innumerable tedious verification processes that cost significant time and&nbsp;money.</p> What If… <p>What if people acting on behalf of an organization could instantly prove it? What if software or devices or equipment deployed by an organization could reliably prove their provenance, to undoubtedly signify from where they derive their claimed authority?</p><p>(continued in <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/the-dawn-of-decentralized-organizational-identity-part-2-organizational-credentials-d8baf5fd9114">The Dawn of Decentralized Organizational Identity, Part 2: Organizational Credentials</a>)</p>

  I was surprised and deeply honored to receive a Lifetime Achievement Award from Kuppinger Cole at EIC 2023. As I recalled when accepting the award, when Kim Cameron received the same award about a decade ago, he said from the podium “No, don’t do this! My career isn’t over!

<p>I was surprised and deeply honored to receive a Lifetime Achievement Award from Kuppinger Cole at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2023">EIC 2023</a>.  As I recalled when accepting the award, when Kim Cameron received the same award about a decade ago, he said from the podium “No, don’t do this! My career isn’t over! I’m not done contributing!”  Kim always had a wicked wit. ;-)</p>
<p>Coincidentally, I described some of the achievements that led to the award during my keynote <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=2345">Touchstones Along My Identity Journey</a>.  After a couple of times of me saying “We won an award for that” during the keynote, I was amused that the audience would break out into laughter each subsequent time that I mentioned another award.  Like this award, the audience’s reaction was unexpected and delightful.</p>

<p>I had the distinct honor of being invited to give a keynote talk at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2023">EIC 2023</a>.  The result was <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5308/1">Touchstones Along My Identity Journey</a>.  My talk abstract was:</p>
<blockquote><p>
In 2005, Kim Cameron excitedly told me about digital identity and set my life on a course to “Build the Internet’s missing identity layer”.  In this talk I’ll tell key stories from my identity journey — stories of the people, ideas, and lessons learned along the way.  I’ll speak of technology and collaboration, usability and business models, solving problems people actually have, and building new ecosystems.  Come with me on this journey of exploration, trials, triumphs, and humor as I recount touchstones of the human endeavor that is digital identity.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kuppinger Cole has posted a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5azezwvEC0">video of my keynote on YouTube</a>.  I was pleased with how well it went. After the first few sentences, I was in the zone!  I hope many of you find the messages in the talk useful.</p>

Selective Disclosure enables you to have a token with many claims (say, an ISO Mobile Drivers’ License (mDL)), and only release the claims necessary for the interaction — for instance, your birthdate but not your home address.  Selective Disclosure enables Minimal Disclosure.  This is sometimes realized using Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) but that’s not always necessary.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/giuseppe-de-marco-bb054245/">Giuseppe De Marco</a> and I presented the session <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5369/2">How do you know who to trust?</a> at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2023">EIC 2023</a>.</p>
<p>A key question when granting access to resources is ‘Who do you trust?’.  It’s often important to know who the party is that you’re interacting with and whether they’ve agreed to the terms and conditions that apply when accessing a resource.</p>
<p>OpenID Connect enables identities of participants to be securely established but doesn’t answer the question of whether a participant is trusted to access a resource such as your personal data.  A complementary mechanism is needed to do that.  In small-scale and static deployments, it’s possible to keep a list of the trusted participants.  However, in large-scale and dynamic deployments, that doesn’t scale.</p>
<p>This presentation described how the OpenID Connect Federation protocol enables scalable trust establishment with dynamic policies.  It does so by employing trust hierarchies of authorities, each of which are independently administered.  Examples of authorities are federation operators, organizations, departments within organizations, and individual sites.</p>
<p>Two OpenID Connect Federations are deployed in Italy, enabling secure access to digital services operated by Italian public and private services with Italian digital identities.  This presentation described why OpenID Connect Federation was selected for them and how it meets their needs.  OpenID Connect Federation is also being used by the GAIN PoC.</p>

<p>This post looks at the a recent fix for Blazor which I think is of massive importance. You can now develop with Blazor in Visual Studio (Preview) using a strong CSP. </p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/Hostedblazor8Aad">https://github.com/damienbod/Hostedblazor8Aad</a></p>



<p>When developing applications, the development environment should be as close as possible to the target production deployment. As a rule, the more these two differ, the more effort you have. You should always develop with HTTPS and you should always use the same CSP in development as in production. (apart from the URLs) This prevents developers adding unsecure scripts and styles before it gets expensive to remove them. This also helps you not deploying unsecure HTTP links, or references to CDNs which cannot be used or using iframes anywhere. All of this reduces the development effort and reduces to overall cost of the project. It is a very bad idea to develop in HTTP and even worse to deploy HTTP. </p>



<p>Visual Studio issue CSP fix:</p>



<p><a href="https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/browserlink-CSP-support-NET-7/10061464">https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/browserlink-CSP-support-NET-7/10061464</a></p>



<p>Before this fix, when using a good CSP definition, the hot reload did not work and the console displayed warnings. To remove this you had to use a weak CSP and this is a bad idea because you would need to fix your CSP issues after deploying. </p>







<p></p>



<p>After this fix, you can develop and deploy using the same CSP definition and also develop using hot reload with an active CSP. </p>



 How to define good security headers 



<p>The best way to secure your session in Blazor is to use the <a href="https://github.com/andrewlock/NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders">NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders</a> Nuget package and add this to the Server part of the Blazor application. Modern secure Blazor applications use the BFF security architecture. By using BFF, no sensitive data is stored in the browser. The NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders package makes it easy to apply all the required headers in one place.</p>



<p>Once the package is part of the project, you can define the headers for Blazor as follows:</p>


  namespace HostedBlazorAad.Server;

public static class SecurityHeadersDefinitions
{
    public static HeaderPolicyCollection GetHeaderPolicyCollection(bool isDev, string? idpHost)
    {
        if(idpHost == null)
        {
            throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(idpHost));
        }

        var policy = new HeaderPolicyCollection()
            .AddFrameOptionsDeny()
            .AddXssProtectionBlock()
            .AddContentTypeOptionsNoSniff()
            .AddReferrerPolicyStrictOriginWhenCrossOrigin()
            .AddCrossOriginOpenerPolicy(builder =&gt; builder.SameOrigin())
            .AddCrossOriginResourcePolicy(builder =&gt; builder.SameOrigin())
            .AddCrossOriginEmbedderPolicy(builder =&gt; builder.RequireCorp())
            .AddContentSecurityPolicy(builder =&gt;
            {
                builder.AddObjectSrc().None();
                builder.AddBlockAllMixedContent();
                builder.AddImgSrc().Self().From("data:");
                builder.AddFormAction().Self().From(idpHost);
                builder.AddFontSrc().Self();
                builder.AddStyleSrc().Self();
                builder.AddBaseUri().Self();
                builder.AddFrameAncestors().None();

                // due to Blazor
                builder.AddScriptSrc()
                    .Self()
                    .WithHash256("v8v3RKRPmN4odZ1CWM5gw80QKPCCWMcpNeOmimNL2AA=")
                    //.WasmUnsafeEval(); // cannot use in .NET due to scripts
                    .UnsafeEval();
            })
            .RemoveServerHeader()
            .AddPermissionsPolicy(builder =&gt;
            {
                builder.AddAccelerometer().None();
                builder.AddAutoplay().None();
                builder.AddCamera().None();
                builder.AddEncryptedMedia().None();
                builder.AddFullscreen().All();
                builder.AddGeolocation().None();
                builder.AddGyroscope().None();
                builder.AddMagnetometer().None();
                builder.AddMicrophone().None();
                builder.AddMidi().None();
                builder.AddPayment().None();
                builder.AddPictureInPicture().None();
                builder.AddSyncXHR().None();
                builder.AddUsb().None();
            });

        if (!isDev)
        {
            // maxAge = one year in seconds
            policy.AddStrictTransportSecurityMaxAgeIncludeSubDomains(maxAgeInSeconds: 60 * 60 * 24 * 365);
        }

        policy.ApplyDocumentHeadersToAllResponses();

        return policy;
    }
}
  


<p>In the actual .NET 8 preview version and .NET 7 version, there is an issue preventing Blazor applications using the WasmUnsafeEval. UnsafeEval is still required. It would be nice if we could use a CSP with a nonce but at present, this is not possible with the actual Blazor version. This is something which can be improved.</p>



<p>The headers are applied the to all responses including static files.</p>


  var app = builder.Build();

if (env.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
    app.UseWebAssemblyDebugging();
}
else
{
    app.UseExceptionHandler("/Error");
}

app.UseSecurityHeaders(
    SecurityHeadersDefinitions.GetHeaderPolicyCollection(env.IsDevelopment(),
        configuration["AzureAd:Instance"]));

app.UseHttpsRedirection();
app.UseBlazorFrameworkFiles();
app.UseStaticFiles();

app.UseRouting();

app.UseNoUnauthorizedRedirect("/api");

app.UseAuthentication();
app.UseAuthorization();
  


 Notes 



<p>The CSP can still be improved, it is not perfect, but this requires changes in Blazor and the application hosting. At least we can still use the same CSP as in production.</p>

back in March) that Meta is building a “text-based social app” for “creators and
public figures”, variously code-named P92, Barcelona, or “Instagram for your thoughts”
and which “could comes as soon as June”.</p>
<p>Why the nervous excitement? Because both leaks state it “will be compatible with
some other apps like Mastodon”.</p>
<p>Many commentators have jumped to the conclusion that Meta will implement ActivityPub
and participate in the Fediverse just like other ActivityPub-enabled app (even if it
might bring ads or such). I believe this conclusion is wrong.</p>
<p>Meta is much more likely to use this “compatibility” story as:</p>
 
 
<p>a public relations / positioning coup to create good vibes for the new app among
important thought leaders (it’s already working, see above!); and</p>
 
 
<p>to present itself as the good guy in its fight with Twitter, which is the real target
here.</p>
 
 
<p>Use it as an avenue to siphon of current (and prospective) Fediverse users into their
own app.</p>
 
 
<p>Let’s see what the evidence there is for my belief. I’m working mostly off the more recent
“primary” leak source <a href="https://liahaberman.substack.com/p/icymi-instagrams-new-app-could-be?">here</a>:</p>
 
 
<p>Last week’s leak does not say “will implement ActivityPub”. The term “ActivityPub” does not
appear at all. (The March leak does have the term, but it is unattributed and the Meta
spokesperson they quote does not mention it.)</p>
 
 
<p>The leak does not say “Meta will implement one (or more) standard protocols for
connecting social applications”. There is nothing about favoring a standards-based
approach in the leak, and certainly not a commitment to it, like they would have for
other standards in other areas.</p>
 
 
<p>The leak says “Will be compatible with some other apps like Mastodon”. Carefully
parse this, specifically:</p>
 
 It does not say how it will be compatible. It could be, for example, by using
the Mastodon-specific client API, or a combination of client and server/ActivityPub
API. That might be helpful to Mastodon (maybe?) but not the rest of the Fediverse. 
 It gives no hint as to what they mean by “compatible”. If you think nicely working,
bidirectional exchange of social media posts with everybody in the Fediverse you
are jumping to a conclusion that is not backed by what has been said. 
 Why do they say “compatible with some other apps like Mastodon”, instead of
“compatible with all other apps speaking ActivityPub”? This sounds far more
selective, and subject to bilateral business agreements, than “any app that
speaks the standard”. 
 
 
 
<p>And then there is this: “Users on other apps will be able search for, follow and interact
with your profile and content [on the Meta app]”. Were you looking for the inverse:
“Users on the Meta app will be able to search for, follow and interact with any
Fediverse profile?” Because it’s not there. Indeed it would have been much simpler
to say “Users in all compatible apps will be able to …” but they don’t say that.</p>
 
 
<p>This latter point is important: On Facebook, famously, you can post links “out” to any
web page on the internet. However, you cannot link “in” from any page on the internet
to an arbitrary Facebook post. Unlike other social networks like Twitter, Facebook
is very asymmetric.</p>
<p>Facebook/Meta has a history of asymmetric implementations of what everybody would
otherwise think are and should be symmetrical systems. This very much reads to me
like Fediverse users can follow Meta users, but Meta users cannot follow Fediverse
users. If they do this, it would wreck the value proposition of the Fediverse, I would think.</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>Now these are all leaks, and as such, we should have very limited confidence in
their truth, accuracy and completeness, and the accuracy of any analysis based on them
such as mine. The proof will be in the app when they
release it.</p>
<p>But: in the meantime, we should be asking ourselves the question: what if Meta
does not play a fair game here? What if they implement things to favor themselves
to the detriment of everybody else, such a asymmetric implementations, all under
the guys of playing nice with open-source apps such as Mastodon? Certainly
that’s what we should expect based on their behavior in the past.</p>

 What is “digital identity”&nbsp;? <p>It’s probably more than you&nbsp;think.</p>What is “digital identity” by Adrian&nbsp;Doerk<p>The term “digital identity” is used to describe a multitude of different concepts. This article provides a comprehensive overview of how different actors use the term and highlights aspects, which are relevant for an individual’s perspective.</p> It depends on the&nbsp;context! <p>The meaning of the term “digital identity” greatly depends on the context it is used in. In the following I will provide you with seven perspectives of how different stakeholders use the&nbsp;term.</p>Image source: <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-digital-identity_en">European Commission</a><p>Government stakeholders, but also regulated companies, which use or offer identification processes (“KYC — Know your customer”) primarily use the term to refer to the real world identity of a person. Mostly this is a credential issued by a government authority to a citizen, such as a passport, ID-card or driver licence. The credential contains a set of attributes describing and differentiating a person from another enabling the identification of a natural&nbsp;person.</p><p>The identification of a person in an online scenario highly depends on the eID-system, but uses a minimum of two authentication factors:</p><p>Inheritance (biometrics): Auto-ident or similar procedures and liveness checks aided by facial recognition<br>Knowledge: PIN, passwords or one-time factors (SMS) etc.<br>Ownership: Smart-cards (e.g. the eID-card) or secure elements on smartphones</p><p>While some governments recognise that digital identity is more than this single credential, the mental model is very much limited to attributes / credentials in&nbsp;general.</p>Image source:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6046815?hl=en">Google</a><p>Private sector companies and the traditional identity and access management (IAM) sector use the term to refer to user accounts under control of a single entity. Hence, the identity is an entry within a proprietary database (active directory) of an organisation, which grants identity subjects (customers or employees) rights to perform certain actions within the domain of the organisation.</p><p>This is a very limited perspective of a digital identity, which is only valid in the domain of the organisation in question. Every internet user has multiple different user accounts at different organisations, creating a fractured identity landscape for individuals and companies alike. Access to these user accounts is mostly enabled via email and password, single sign-on solutions by big-tech (“Sing-in with google”) or other approaches without password.</p>Image source:&nbsp;<a href="https://cheqd.io/web-3.0-and-digital-identity">cheqd.io</a><p>The WEB 3.0 community primarily uses the term to refer to user accounts, reputation systems, credentials and assets. The community frequently uses the term “decentralised identity” or “WEB3 identity” to describe their approach and differentiate it to government issued “real world” identities. WEB3 solutions differentiate their solutions by using distributed ledgers (blockchains) with public read and write access as a single source of truth. By using a shared infrastructure, WEB3 solutions aim to avoid centralised and proprietary systems.</p><p>When accessing WEB3 identity solutions it’s crucial to differentiate between on- and off-chain identities. On-chain identities are written directly to the ledger and therefore are public by default. Once written to the ledger they can’t be deleted, only declared invalid. These on-chain identities should be handled with great care when dealing with personal identifiable information. Examples are NFTs, Soulbound Tokens (SBT) and the Ethereum Name Systems&nbsp;(ENS).</p><p>This is in strong contrast to off-chain identities, for which only the public keys of issuers and other metadata is written to the public ledger. Examples include verifiable credentials and some zero-knowledge proof implementations.</p>Image source:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/09/26/self-sovereign-identity-taking-control-over-your-digital-identity/">Forbes</a><p>The Self-Sovereign identity (SSI) community uses the term for a variety of perspectives, but focuses on user accounts, credentialing and relationships as well as governance of identity frameworks. These frameworks aim to provide a foundation for digital trust — not only in cryptography, but also in humans, organisations and processes. The community sees SSI as a concept, which provides principles as a guideline to ensure an identity ecosystem in which the individual is empowered and protected. The solutions aim to provide a holistic answer, which is not only user-centric, but also enables people to assert control over their relationships / user accounts.</p><p>The community exclusively uses verifiable credentials in combination with decentralised identifiers controlled by the user from within a digital wallet. SSI integrations do work with centralised and decentralised public key infrastructure. Currently, most integration leverage distributed ledgers with permissioned writing and public reading rights to ensure regulatory compliance.</p>Image source: <a href="https://cybelangel.com/digital-identity-theft-is-within-everyones-reach-on-the-dark-web/">cybelangel.com</a><p>Service providers specialised in identity fraud prevention use the term to refer to the personal data of a person offered by data brokers or databases in the darknet. The data itself can range from email addresses and passwords to income level, postal addresses, credit card information or other behavioural and sensitive personal data. In the majority of cases this personal data is collected and distributed without consent of the person, or even worse without any kind of knowledge or control by the affected person nor watchdogs or governments. According to <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">haveibeenpwned.com</a> 12,485,202,808 user accounts (incl. Email and phone numbers) have been exposed to the darknet in March&nbsp;2023.</p>Image source:&nbsp;D<a href="https://www.deloitte.com/global/en/services/risk-advisory/perspectives/the-future-of-digital-identity.html">eloitte</a><p>Consulting companies see digital identity as a foundation to increase efficiency of business processes for organisations. Hence, they combine different perspectives, but focus on the needs of an organisation. Furthermore, they differentiate between organisational identities and personal identities, with the latter being a customer of a business, or a citizen of a&nbsp;country.</p>Image Source: <a href="https://www.hartware.de/2019/12/24/how-to-protect-your-digital-identity-with-vpn-for-windows/">hartware.de</a><p>Advertisement companies and virtual private network (VPN) providers see a digital identity as behavioural data of individuals. While advertisement companies aim to collect vast amounts of behavioural data of individuals, VPN providers try to help individuals to reduce this collection.</p><p>It’s noteworthy that not all behavioural data is directly connected to individuals. Some analytics and advertisement providers anonymise behavioural data to a certain extent with cohort models. These models group users who share common characteristics and behaviours in known cohorts to facilitate effective targeted campaigns for advertisers.</p> Mental Models: Providing a mental framework for different perspectives: <p>The following five mental models describe what people refer to, when speaking about identity and provide a useful structure of how these models can be executed in a digital environment. The five mental models were published by <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot7-toronto/blob/master/final-documents/mental-models.md">experts of the RWOT community</a> and are quoted within this paragraph.</p>Image Source: Adrian&nbsp;Doerk<p>Space-time: sees identity as resolving the question of physical continuity of an entity through space and time, answering if the physical body under evaluation has a continuous link through space and time to a known&nbsp;entity.</p><p>Presentation: sees identity as how we present ourselves to society, answering if this is how the subject chooses to be&nbsp;known.</p><p>Attribute: sees identity as the set of attributes related to an entity recorded in a specific system, answering who this data is&nbsp;about.</p><p>Relationship: sees identity emerging through interactions and relationships with others, answering how this person is&nbsp;related.</p><p>Capability: pragmatically defines identity in terms of an individual’s capability to perform some task, answering what the subject can actually&nbsp;do.</p> Overview of aspects of a digital&nbsp;identity Image source: Adrian Doerk, What is “digital identity”?<p>As illustrated in the graphic above, an individual’s digital identity comprises countless aspects from different categories. This includes public services provided by governments, regions or cities, which in most cases require the identification of a person. Identification is also required for some financial services and activities as well as a limited set of activities in the professional, educational, health, travel, home and family categories. Nevertheless, the vast majority of activities in the private sector currently don’t require the identification of a person. The categories data, communication and organisation do not contain any activities for which an identification is required.</p><p>Another notable distinction is the frequency of usage within certain categories. While we use tools for the communication and organisation of data as well as social activities on a daily basis, we rather rarely use public services.</p> Should we stop using the term “digital identity”? <p>No, however we need to be aware that other people might have a totally different understanding of what it means. Using the term “digital identity” exclusively for a limited sub-set of the above mentioned aspects isn’t wrong, but it neglects crucial parts of being a human. This is especially true for using the term solely for the identification process of a person using a government issued identity credential.</p> About the&nbsp;author: <p>Adrian Doerk focuses on providing user-centric digital identity services with digital wallets, which ensure privacy and empowerment of the individual.

I tried Midjourney to create the cover photo for this post “robot peering in through a window” and… yeah, apologies for the nightmares.<p>I’ve seen a dozen posts about Bard vs ChatGPT. Everyone seems to be breaking them down in terms of their features. But before using Bard, I had a simple question: Would my Bard convos be used against me? Will my conversations be the raw material for producing ad-targets on my&nbsp;back?</p><p>According to the privacy policies of Bard and ChatGPT, and here’s what I&nbsp;learned.</p><p>To set the stage: data protection and privacy really matter. No matter how many “not medical advice” or other warning labels these softwares give, people will continue using them for deeply personal matters. If these sensitive queries create a target on my back, I’ll be more cautious about what questions I&nbsp;ask.</p><p>In addition, many businesses disallow use of ChatGPT or similar tools on work laptops for fear of models being trained on proprietary business data. (Which, by the way, doesn’t make sense, given these same businesses allow employees to use Google, which is also training its own AI models on what you&nbsp;search.)</p><p>Privacy &amp; data protection aren’t just ethical, but have real implications to product adoption. So how does Bart compare to ChatGPT across a few important dimensions?</p> Bard vs&nbsp;ChatGPT <p>First of all, everything you submit to Bard is “read, annotated, and processed” by “trained reviewers” and is stored for “up to three years”. This is in contrast to OpenAI — they “retain new conversations for 30 days and review them only when needed to monitor for abuse, before permanently deleting”. ChatGPT is the clear winner&nbsp;here.</p><p>In addition to manual review, your submissions to Bard are also used in automated fashion to “improve and develop Google products and services and machine-learning technologies”. To be fair, the same thing is done in ChatGPT, unless you pay them for the business subscription where they claim “end users’ data won’t be used to train our models by default”. Github CoPilot, which is powered by OpenAI, has a business subscription with similar guarantees.</p><p>This brings us to the reason for my exploration: will my Bard conversations be used against me, to target me for advertising? According to Google, “Bard conversations are not being used for advertising purposes, and we will clearly communicate any changes to this approach in the&nbsp;future.”</p><p>But as a company with $225 billion in advertising revenue last year (at least, that’s what Bard told me, so I’m not sure how confident I should be in that answer!). The stakes are too high — it’s obvious that they will monetize Bard in the future. Fortunately, you can feel reasonably confident your Bart usage in the near-term won’t be used for advertising, because when they retain your conversations for up to 3 years, they disconnect them from your account. The conversations associated with your Google account are stored for 18 months by default, but you can configure that in settings, and delete specific conversations, similar to your Youtube history,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>Ultimately I feel like this is another chapter in the saga of ad-supported, free products vs subscriptions. I pay for a Pro ChatGPT license, and will continue doing so and using ChatGPT as my primary companion in my day-to-day.</p>

<p>Federated identity stores are like music CDs: large troves of data to be consumed from a single source. Self-sovereign identity is like streaming: share just what you want, just when it's needed. </p><p>In a recent discussion we had, <a href="https://allthingsanalytics.com/">Marie Wallace</a> shared a wonderful analogy for verifiable credentials. I think it helps with understanding how credentials will be adopted. She compares traditional approaches to identity and newer, decentralized approaches to the move from music CDs to streaming. I'm old enough to remember the hubbub around file sharing. As this short video on Napster shows, the real winner in the fight against piracy was Apple and, ultimately, other streaming services:</p>    <p>Apple changed the business model for online music from one focused on sales of physical goods to one focused on licensing individual tracks. They launched the iPod and the iTunes music store and used their installed user base to bring the music companies to the table. They changed the business model and that ultimately gave birth to the music streaming services we use today.</p><p>So, what's this got to do with identity? Most of the online identity services we use today are based on a centralized "identity provider" model. In the consumer space, this is the Social Login model where you use your account at Google, Facebook, or some other service to access some third-party online service. But the same thing is true in the workforce side where each company creates great stores of customer, employee, and partner data that they can use to make authorization decisions or federate with others. These are the CDs of identity.</p><p>The analog to streaming is decentralized or self-sovereign identity (SSI). In SSI the source of identity information (e.g., a drivers license bureau, bank, university, etc.) is called the issuer. They issue credentials to a person, called the holder, who carries various digital credentials in a wallet on their phone or laptop. When someone, called the verifier, needs to know something about them, the holder can use one or more credentials to prove attributes about themselves. Instead of large, centralized collections of data that companies can tap at will, the data is streamed to the verifier when it's needed. And only the attributes that are germane to that exchange need to be shared. Cryptography ensures we can have confidence in the payload. </p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8500692-5569-4ab1-b5cb-63d1019f3715_768x435.jpeg">    </a>The three parties to credential exchange <p>Identity streaming has several benefits:</p>  <p>Confidence in the integrity of the data is increased because of the underlying cryptographic protocols. </p>  <p>Data privacy is increased because only what needs to be shared for a given interaction is transmitted. </p>  <p>Data security is increased because there are fewer large, comprehensive troves of data about people online for hackers to exploit.</p>  <p>The burden of regulatory compliance is reduced since companies need to keep less data around when they know they can get trustworthy information from the holder just in time.</p>  <p>The cost of maintaining, backing up, and managing large troves of identity data goes away.</p>  <p>Access to new data is easier because of the flexibility of just-in-time attribute delivery.</p>  <p>And yet, despite these benefits, moving from big stores of identity data to streaming identity when needed will take time. The big stores already exist. Companies have dedicated enormous resources to building and managing them. They have integrated all their systems with them and depend on them to make important business decisions. And it works. So why change it?</p><p>The analogy also identifies the primary driver of adoption: demand. Napster clearly showed that there was demand for online music. Apple fixed the business model problem. And thousands of businesses were born or died on the back of the this change from CDs to streaming.</p><p>Digital credentials don't have the same end user demand pull that music does. Music is emotional and the music industry was extracting huge margins by making people buy an $18 CD to get the one song they liked. People will likely love the convenience that verifiable credentials offer and they'll be more secure and private, but that's not driving demand in any appreciable way. I think Riley Hughes, CEO of Trinsic.id, is on to something with his <a href="https://northernblock.io/building-digital-trust-ecosystems/">ideas about digital trust ecosystems</a>. Ecosystems that need increased trust and better security are likely to be the real drivers of this transition. That's demand too, but of a different sort: not demand for credentials themselves, but for better models of interaction. After all, people don’t want a drill, they want a hole. </p><p>Verifiable data transfer is a powerful idea. But to make it valuable, you need a trust gap. Here's an example of a trust gap: early on, the veracity and security of a web site was a big problem. As a result many people were scared to put their credit card into a web form. The trust gap was that there was no way to link a domain name to a public key. Transport Layer Security (TLS, also known as SSL) uses digital certificates, which link a domain name to a public key (and perhaps other data) in a trustworthy way to plug the gap.</p><p>There are clearly ecosystems with trust gaps right now. For example, fraud is a big problem in online banking and ecommerce. Fraud is the symptom of a trust gap between the scam’s target and the legitimate actor that they think they're interacting with. If you can close this gap, then the fraud is eliminated. Once Alice positively knows when she's interacting with her bank and when she's not, she'll be much harder to fool. <a href="https://www.passkeys.io/">Passkeys</a> are one solution to this problem. Verifiable credentials are another—one that goes beyond authentication (knowing who you're talking to) to transferring data in a trustworthy way.</p><p>In the case of online music, the solution and the demand were both there, but the idea wasn't legitimate in the eyes of the music industry. Apple had the muscle to bring the music industry to the table and help them see the light. They provided much needed legitimacy to the idea online music purchases and, ultimately, streaming. They didn't invent online music, rather they created a viable business model for it and made it valuable. They recognized demand and sought out a new model to fill the demand. Verifiable credentials close trust gaps. And the demand for better ways to prevent fraud and reduce friction is there. What's missing, I think, is that most of the companies looking for solutions don't yet recognize the legitimacy of verifiable credentials.</p><p>Got an idea about how verifiable credentials will be legitimized?

<p>This article shows how to implement Azure Privileged Identity Management access in an ASP.NET Core application using an Azure security group. An Azure Conditional Access&nbsp;Authentication context is used for the Azure administrator giving access to the group for Azure AD users. The Authentication context is setup to require a phishing resistant authentication. An Enterprise application is used to only allow assigned members of the security group access to the ASP.NET Core application. The application can only be used as specified in the Azure PIM member definition. </p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/AzurePim">https://github.com/damienbod/AzurePim</a></p>



<p>A Conditional Access&nbsp;Authentication context is setup so it can be used in the PIM group configuration. This Authentication context is used in an Azure CA policy which requires a phishing resistant authentication. </p>







<p></p>



<p>An Azure security group was created and this group was onboarded to the PIM groups definitions. The Azure Authentication context is used for activation. The administrator activating users in this group must have authenticated using a phishing resistant authentication.  </p>



<p></p>







<p></p>



<p>User assignments can be added to the group. Each assignment requires a reason description which is sent in the email notification.</p>



<p></p>







<p></p>



<p>The Enterprise application used for the ASP.NET Core application is setup to only allow assigned users from the Azure security group. The Assignment Required is set to true.</p>



<p></p>







<p></p>



<p>In the users and the groups, the security group is added.</p>







<p></p>



<p>The ASP.NET Cor application is created to authenticate using the Azure App registration with a secret, meaning the application is a confidential client. Public applications should not be used for administration business processes. Microsoft.Identity.Web is used to implement the confidential OpenID Connect client using the code flow and PKCE.</p>


  builder.Services.AddAuthentication(
		OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
	.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApp(
		builder.Configuration.GetSection("AzureAd"))
	.EnableTokenAcquisitionToCallDownstreamApi()
	.AddDistributedTokenCaches();

builder.Services.AddRazorPages()
    .AddMicrosoftIdentityUI();
  


<p>When a user is assigned, an email is sent to the user and the user can use the application to authenticate and gain access to the application.</p>







<p></p>



 Notes 



<p>A lot of the different features from the Azure AD access management was used in the setup. You could also force all users in this group to use a phishing resistant policy by applying the same authentication context to the group and not just the PIM administrator assigning users to the group. You could also use roles instead of groups in the PIM. There are lots of different possibilities and it is imported to choose the correct ones for your environment following KISS. If you don’t need it, then don’t use it. PIM requires an Azure P2 license. Azure AD PIM + Conditional Access integration can be used to force all types of business security requirements and features.</p>

<p>This morning someone forwarded me an article that was featured in Children’ Health Defense’s online publication “The Defender.” “<a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/reboot-environmental-movement-protect-freedom/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">Can we reboot the environmental movement so it protects freedom, too</a>?” was written by W. Aaron Vandiver, a conservationist author who lives just up the road from Aspen (Aspen Institute), Colorado (the blockchain / e-government state). The piece extols the potential for an “eco-libertarian” environmental movement to bring together populists from the Left and the Right. I can definitely see this fitting into a Transpartisan “third-way” platform. </p>
<p>The press around Robert F. Kennedy Jr. doing a <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/robert-kennedy-jr-campaign-debut-130000642.html">public launch of his candidacy</a> at Miami’s 2023 Bitcoin conference has me pretty rattled. </p>
<p>Whitney Webb will be there, too. </p>

<p>Whitney Webb is a supporter of blockchain media, having been an early adopter of the Rokfin platform where content creators are paid in Web3 RAE tokens. In the video below, she and her Slow News Day colleagues are talking about me, implying I only took a stand against blockchain to disparage her and her friends. I guess Webb’s investigative prowess didn’t extend to entering “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/page/20/?s=blockchain">blockchain</a>” in the search bar of my blog. Had she bothered to do that, she would have seen I’d been writing about my concerns about blockchain and impact finance since 2017, long before I’d ever heard of her. There are more details in the description block of the video (accessible <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxZW0-H4-NE">here</a>) if you want the backstory. To be honest, influencer spats are not a good use of my time, but I did think it was important to document her behavior. In the end I trust that most people are adults who can make informed decisions about what information they consume. I don’t expect her fans to resonate with my blog, and I’m fine with that.</p>
<p>In the meantime, someone claiming to be Webb said the talk at Bitcoin 2023 Miami will be about “The WEF Partnership Against Cybercrime and how it is a major intelligence effort to threat destroy financial privacy.” I haven’t confirmed the identity of the person who left the comment. There was no way to verify it was posted by Webb, the name was @cool22fire “kunjabihari adhikari.” Still, I’m happy to give the benefit of the doubt. If this is not the real Whitney Webb, and the real one wants to contact me at timpsila@proton.com to correct the record, she can. This person also said Webb’s participation in the event was simply educational and not an endorsement of Bitcoin. Take that for what it’s worth. The title of her video about me was titled “<a href="https://vimeo.com/556146346">Whitney Webb on Bitcoin 2021-05-23</a>.” There’s also a clip of her discussing the possibility that Bitcoin could be banned and her admiration for Bitcoiners, whom she says are on “the frontier of fighting a lot of these encroachments on basically what is the end of privacy for Americans.” The clip was featured on the <a href="https://www.swanbitcoin.com/">Swan Bitcoin</a> youtube channel in April of 2023.</p>

<p>Combined with this op-ed pitching a thinly-cloaked web3 tokenization of natural capital, I realized I needed to spend the morning pulling together my thoughts. Of course natural capital and ReFi (Web3 “regenerative” finance) is Leo Saraceno’s wheelhouse, while mine is more human capital. You can read his recent article on the topic at Silicon Icarus <a href="https://siliconicarus.org/2023/02/11/natural-asset-managers-how-decentralized-ledger-technology-will-drive-the-ecosystem-services-sector/">here</a>. </p>
<p>Check out this pair of tweets pulled from Robert F. Kennedy’s account over the past few weeks. It’s hard for me to believe these are his own words. The “ecology of currency” language is straight up lifted from Bernard Lietaer, creator of the Euro. When viewed together, the statements demonstrate an affinity for social impact tokenomics, “free” market investing using digital assets to optimize “wellbeing” for “the common” good. Of course that’s the kind of language they’ll use to sell it. </p>
<p>My take is they are crafting a new Bobby character to replace his two previous roles, now conflicting. Combined, these archetypes will be positioned as a populist freeDOM superhero whose assignment is to convince you that a living gamified existence inside an out-side in “optimization” robot (Jeremy Pitt’s cyberphysical-sociotechnical system) is the future we’ve always dreamed of – rather than a life sentence served in a Skinner Box with soul-sucking energetic parasites that is actually is.</p>

<p>In retrospect I see how the pieces fit together – why I got so much pushback for my opposition to blockchain from resistance influencers like John Bush and Derrick Broze who featured <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5F7gx1RZmrLLucHXais3wW">RFK Jr. at the Greater Reset</a>. I understand better why coverage of the struggle of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0i35RaoHmM">India’s farmers</a> got squelched even as the Canadian truckers’ convoy saga was uplifted. A spiritually authentic, culturally grounded resistance to techno-life, the kind demonstrated a great personal cost by India’s farmers, could NEVER be allowed rise to prominence. No, the era of the Web3 tokenized freeDOM “commons” was meant to be driven forward by emerging-tech-loving enthusiasts. In programmed reality the Sikhs didn’t stand a chance, but my gut tells me this engagement is unfolding in realms far beyond the coders’ binary ones and zeros. Keep your soulbound tokens and crypto, my heart remains aligned with theirs despite the challenging odds.</p>
<p>Today’s livestream is the first in a series I’m calling “Camelot Corner.” I’ve created a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnNSjVGWqTO5SEAy4QCgGFFRYkmYGMvUu">playlist</a> for it on my channel. I’ve spent much of the past week going through the IRS 990s and audits for The Mercury Project / Children’s Health Defense. I’ve looked into the board members. I’ve used the Foundation Directory Online to find grants via other funders, including one for $586,000 in 2020 from Greater Horizons Kansas City, a black box community foundation that specializes in managing hundreds of millions of dollars in <a href="https://inequality.org/research/donor-advised-fund-numbers/">donor-advised-funds</a>, or DAFs. Click this <a href="https://www.greaterhorizons.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/990-GH-2020.pdf">link</a> and search for “Children’s Health Defense.” Through this philanthropic mechanism donations can’t be traced back to the source, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230512211537/https://childrenshealthdefense.org/about-us/donor-advised-funds/">a practice that is actively promoted on the CHD donor website</a>. </p>
<p>So much for government and corporate capture – did you think somehow non-profits were exempt? Those who follow my work know that the non-profit industrial complex has a central role to play in social impact finance and impact data collection. We just want to believe “our team” wouldn’t be in on the grift. Would it surprise you to know Children’s Health Defense used donated funds to buy access to <a href="https://www.exposedbycmd.org/2022/07/19/republican-ag-pay-to-play-group-raises-4-9-million-in-second-quarter/">Republican Attorney’s General</a>? Don’t worry; the recipient got caught and had to return the illegal contribution, but don’t you think Bobby, the lawyer, should have known better?</p>
<p>Money is power and power corrupts. It behooves us to continue to ask questions and hold the institutions into which we put our trust accountable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Letter from Sean Filzen, aka “Washington Sean”</p>
<p><br>
May 8th, 2023</p>
<p>Dear Alison,</p>
<p>First and foremost, thank you for taking the time to read my work.&nbsp; Sincere thanks for your kind words as an introduction to my last guest post.&nbsp; As we all lead incredibly busy lives, it means so much to have discovered your research and archives which are growing by leaps and bounds as the days and weeks fly by. How you do it and still find time to engage and read and share the work of others is commendable. And it is even more influential knowing I have found an audience and a space in which to share and collaborate in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>While I am not so much interested in fame or fortune, I’d be deceiving myself and your readers if I did not admit that I do seek some attention; and flattery has a way of carrying our lofty ideals even higher into the realms of admiration, doesn’t it?&nbsp; But beyond the soft strokes of my own ego, what I love most about your website is the sheer amount of knowledge one can glean — if they so desire to put in the work and take their critical inquiries seriously. And as the fellow readers, commenters and guest authors have continuously confirmed, they too offer me equally as much appreciation and insights as your work.&nbsp; Bravo for all that you have toiled to establish and being a beacon in these perilous times!</p>
<p>Thus, it is with this excitement and anticipation of further collaboration that I felt compelled to offer you a more thorough biographical account of how and why in this time, this spring, in the year 2023, there seems to be a personal calling to me to ‘rise to the occasion’ and step forth into the public sphere in a more pronounced manner.&nbsp; Or, as my wife puts it, my throat chakra is activating as my kundalini is rising.</p>
<p>My first post to Wrench In The Gears, from February 2022, was titled<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2022/02/07/the-grocery-business-is-dye-ing-guest-post/"> ‘The Grocery Business is Dye-Ing’,</a> and I composed this piece under a pseudonym for fear of reprisal and termination of my wife’s position at her employer of fourteen years – New Season’s Grocery stores.&nbsp; The piece was an expose of how New Season’s, “the world’s first Certified B Corp Grocer,” is not as transparent and well intentioned as the brand presents itself, and the essay followed the professional pursuits of one of New Season’s more shadowy board members — Justin Dye.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When writing this letter, it was of minor interest to check in on Mr. Dye and see what he has been up to with his latest efforts and his newest venture – Schwazze, Inc. aka ‘Medicine Man Technologies’.&nbsp; Schwazze bills itself as a rapidly growing cannabis firm offering a business model for investors that includes everything “from seed to sale.”&nbsp; On its Corporate Website, the word ‘schwazze’ is defined as an action verb, meaning “a cultivation technique that prunes a living organism to create more growth.”&nbsp; And Schwazze proclaims it wants to “focus on data-driven innovation and unparalleled thinking to create the next era of cannabis.”&nbsp; If that is not enough, Schwazze proudly bills its brand tagline as “Transcending the Human Condition Through Cannabis.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps it is just me, but the obvious throwback to the early 20th century efforts of Luther Burbank and his famous work The Training of the Human Plant appear to be cultivating something suspicious at Schwazze.&nbsp; And surely the nod on one of Schwazze’s new startups confirms that something more nefarious is going on in the backrooms. In 2021<a href="https://schwazze.com/our-brands/"> Schwazze Bioscience</a> was established and serves as the research and development arm of the Schwazze brand. “Its high-level mission is to blend both the art and science of plant molecules and advanced technologies to further enhance products and improve the human condition.”&nbsp; (The photo for Schwazze Biosciences conveniently features two vials with a light green liquid in a glass beaker with a third vial filled with a light magenta colored liquid, sitting adjacent to a cannabis leaf in a petri dish).</p>
<p>But I am not writing today to rehash the questionable integrity of people like Justin Dye.&nbsp; I am writing to you today to clarify why I, Sean Filzen, became so interested in Justin Dye and New Seasons Market in the first place.</p>
<p>You see, in August of 2021 my wife and I decided to try for a second child and conceived our daughter Margaret while on a camping trip near a beautiful spring in the foothills of Mount Saint Helens.&nbsp; By February of 2022 my wife was well into her third trimester and there was really no negotiating what sort of risky medical procedures or other therapies that my wife was willing to experiment with.&nbsp; She had already moved from her previous position in the wellness department and worked in the ‘freight crew’, taking shifts overnight to avoid wearing a mask as much as possible as her employer would not accommodate additional ‘oxygen breaks’ as she had requested.&nbsp; When the January policy enacted by her employer required all employees to either accept a medical treatment or file for exemption (with mandatory masks and test/trace/track for all who were granted exemptions), tensions were incredibly high.</p>
<p>She took her maternity leave as early as allowable and somehow her store manager conveniently failed to hand her the letter from corporate that instructed employees how to file for an exemption if they desired.&nbsp; So, without receiving the letter instructing her how to file for an exemption, she went on leave.&nbsp; Another employee and friend was terminated in February 2022 for refusing to turn in an exemption letter at all.&nbsp; She, along with my wife and several other of her coworkers, considered such a policy a form of coerced consent, and to acknowledge the letter as lawful would continue to endow the company with special powers to an otherwise unlawful and unnegotiated actions.&nbsp; But as my wife had not received the letter, we took it as a symbolic gesture that her store manager did not have the guts to hand a woman who was seven months pregnant such an inconsiderate request.</p>
<p>Of modest means, our strategy was ultimately to ride out her maternity benefits as long as possible and decide what to do after our daughter was born.&nbsp; Margaret was born at home on May 19th – a beautiful and healthy girl weighing in at just over nine pounds!&nbsp; Any drama or negative underpinnings of what still churned in the background felt far, far away from our lives.&nbsp; But it was much to our chagrin that in the middle of July, Kayla learned she had been terminated from her job.&nbsp; Due to a technicality, she was terminated on July 4th, 2022, a date most fitting if you are able to consider the grand irony of it all.&nbsp; To be terminated, by the world’s first certified B-Corp Grocery Store, while on maternity leave, after fourteen years of employment, is no small feat in today’s day and age.&nbsp; And to be fired on July 4th, of all the days of the calendar, well, one might make their own inferences on how we are planning to celebrate our Independence day in 2023.&nbsp; Rest assured there will be some sparks flying.</p>
<p>So, I hope you can deduce that the first piece I felt compelled to write, my first truly investigative essay, was driven by a passion and desire to defend children’s health.&nbsp; My unborn child, was of course, the forefront of my cause.&nbsp; But also the thought of how other expecting parents are grappling such tenuous issues continues to loom over my heart and mind.&nbsp; Defending children’s health, and I mean truly defending it, is what radicalized me.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>My anger, my frustration, my resentment towards injustice and the things in the world that aren’t commendable has always been a present factor in my life.&nbsp; But when such malevolent forces coalesce into a darkness that seeks to attack and degrade the lives of those who cannot fully defend themselves, a line is crossed and all the raw emotion that was once just my own is catalyzed into something bigger – at least I hope it is.&nbsp; I hope that I can continue to find my voice that seeks to protect children and natural life from forces unseen and unknown to so many in our daily lives.&nbsp; I hope to raise awareness and shine a light in the darkest corners of our society as we barrel backwards and start to run the hamster wheels of history, repeating in lockstep all the lessons we supposedly learned twenty, fifty or even one hundred years ago.</p>
<p>Following my wife’s termination from her job we committed to a new way of being and a new lifestyle.&nbsp; Our personal motto has become “everything is a distraction from growing our own food and medicine.”&nbsp; And while it is an incredible amount of work to produce even a modicum of our own sustenance, it is perhaps the most rewarding experience I have personally experienced.&nbsp; Our efforts on our small farm are further bolstered by watching our older daughter, who is almost five, reap the literal benefits of everything we have sown thus far.&nbsp; So, it is without remonstrance that we have moved into 2023 and put the unfortunate effects of unlawful termination behind us.&nbsp; Fighting a corporate egregore like Justin Dye and New Seasons is likely to prove fruitless, and instead we decided to keep our heads down and largely mind our own business as the dust of the “new normal” still settles on society.</p>
<p>But then something else happened in the middle of April this year that has reignited the fire that burns inside me, blowing a strong wind into the glowing embers and fanning the flames of anger and resentment.&nbsp; Before I address this pivotal issue, I wanted to offer you just one more facet of our lives that feels pertinent as we discuss the integral defense of children’s health.</p>
<p>In October of 2018 our first daughter was born.&nbsp; And both being fairly health conscious, health aware people, our feelings on the CDC schedule of childhood immunology and vaccination policies was mixed.&nbsp; Intuitively I think we both distrusted the overly aggressive nature of such a schedule that lacked substantial epidemiological studies warranting so many shots in such a short amount of time.&nbsp; But fear is a powerful force, and it has a way of breaking down even the most strongly held beliefs, often calling into question one’s abilities as a parent to make the decisions for your child that you believe are correct.&nbsp; Fear can compel people to do things that they would never have considered doing under different circumstances or contexts.</p>
<p>In the early months of 2019, Clark County Washington, where we make our home, experienced a ‘measles outbreak’.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking back, the<a href="https://clark.wa.gov/public-health/measles-investigation"> Clark County Measles outbreak</a> bears many signature markings of a simulation event designed to improve responses and outcomes in larger emergencies, but the integrity of the measles outbreak is neither here nor there in the grand scheme of things.&nbsp; Prior to the global ‘corona’ lockdowns about a year later, such a public health emergency as the relatively small measles outbreak in Clark County created quite a bit of hysteria in our local community.&nbsp; It was the subject of both local and national news and the CDC even took notice with<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6819a5.htm"> a substantial study</a> published on its website.&nbsp; Perhaps the measles outbreak of 2019 primed our consciousness for the events of 2020-2022.&nbsp; Perhaps without such an outbreak in our home county the year before, we would have seen the much bigger events that proceeded in a different light, but I like to believe that we still would have found our path.</p>
<p>It was in February of 2019, while on our annual family vacation, that we chanced to stop in to visit one of my customers in Crescent City, California (a small ocean town at the very northern part of the state).&nbsp; My customer was a woman in her mid-eighties, her husband had passed away a year prior, and I still credit them both as a big part of my start in my commercial furniture business.&nbsp; So, we stopped into her hotel for a visit and a coffee, and the adult daughter of my customer joined us.&nbsp; The daughter was very outspoken and provided us with several resources.&nbsp; As I am typically inclined to listen to people who are more versed on subjects than I am, I was deeply moved by her pleas not to follow the CDC schedule with our own child, still untainted at the young age of only four months old.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The daughter of my customer gifted us the book ‘The Vaccine Friendly Plan’ written by Dr. Paul Thomas.&nbsp; I quickly read the book from cover to cover and from that moment forward my resolve to defend children’s health as I understood it has grown clearer and my resolve stronger and more fortified.&nbsp; It was actually around the age of ten months that we took my daughter for her first ‘well baby visit’ at the offices of Dr. Paul Thomas.&nbsp; Thomas’s clinic ‘Integrative Pediatrics’ was coincidentally located only about sixty miles from our home, across the Columbia River in a suburban community outside of Portland, Oregon.&nbsp; I remember telling our nurse practitioner about our farm animals and I was still not sure about the TDaP shot benefits/risks.&nbsp; Our nurse promptly summoned Dr. Thomas himself so he could very politely provide some additional interrogation as to our situation, thus allowing us to fully understand the legal and practical implications of ‘informed consent,’ as well as the pros and cons of the TDaP shots.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alison – one of the things that makes your work so commendable is that not only are you one of the people who is doing the research, but you are also doing the work, going to the meetings, shaking the hands and asking the questions.&nbsp; I am willing to wager that you have shaken the hands of many important people who have themselves shaken the hands of even more important people.&nbsp; Dr. Paul is something of a celebrity in<a href="https://healthfreedomsummit.com/"> the Health Freedom Movement</a> and he is one of the important people I have shaken hands with.&nbsp; In November of 2020, Dr. Paul, along with James Lyons-Weiler, published a now retracted study titled<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33266457/"> Relative Incidence of Office Visits and Cumulative Rates of Billed Diagnoses Along the Axis of Vaccination</a>.&nbsp; The study was a subject of national controversy and in a time of great conflict in what should have been an unrelated issue, the Oregon Health Authority promptly targeted Dr. Paul and suspended his medical license pending an investigation.&nbsp; The controversy eventually became the subject of a book by Jeremy Hammond titled The War on Informed Consent: The Persecution of Dr. Paul Thomas by the Oregon Medical Board.&nbsp; The book is available on the<a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/store/the-war-on-informed-consent-the-persecution-of-dr-paul-thomas-by-the-oregon-medical-board/"> Children’s Health Defense (CHD) store</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The forward of the book was written by none other than Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we have shaken the hands of important people who have themselves shaken hands with even more important people, what should dawn on us is that even as unimportant people, or common people, we occasionally do find ourselves in the capacity to reach important people with our important messages.&nbsp; If important people, like Dr. Paul and Jeremy Hammond, can stay true to the literal definition of defending children’s health, then the work we do as activists and investigative researchers is not fruitless.&nbsp; We can make a difference and we should not be dismayed by the dismissals and lack of interest by those very, very important people who seem out of reach with the message that threatens their livelihood or questions their integrity.&nbsp; And while Dr. Paul is no longer our family pediatrician, as he has&nbsp; joined or been co-opted into a movement that he may not be fully aware of himself, this should not fully dismiss him or the important role he continues to play as a first step for so many other parents and caregivers just beginning their own journey of discovery and definition of informed consent when making lifelong health decisions for themselves and their family.</p>
<p>In a sense, the way our family has navigated health care and the health services delivery models available to us is probably not all that unique.&nbsp; The decisions we have made (or were led to make) could be considered an excellent example of cognitive domain management, a topic that has captivated my interests as of late.&nbsp; I wonder, how would I perceive the announcement of RFK Jr. to run for president had I not found your research and body of work?&nbsp; Likewise, I wonder, in what ways am I still being managed, or nudged, to stay within the confines of the domains that I am in now?&nbsp; But there is one thing that I do not wonder about, one thing that becomes clearer and clearer every day.&nbsp; And that is the passion and fire that is now raging inside me to defend children’s health, to really, really defend children’s health.&nbsp; If it were not for the likes of people like Alison McDowell, Lynn Davenport and Jason Bosch (and countless others who are doing the good work) who have freely risen to the occasion to defend children’s health, then I am saddened to consider that who (and what) we are left with is going to provide us with less than desirable outcomes.</p>
<p>After being misled and misdirected and misinformed over and over again, I am prone to believe that we cannot, and should not, accept the answers and agendas of influences and forces that wield power over our social networks.&nbsp; We should not simply allow our conversations on critical issues to be managed or steered in a direction that predetermines outcomes that favor consolidated power over individual autonomy.</p>
<p>As I mentioned above, it was what happened in April of this year, less than a month ago, that re-ignited a fire I tried desperately to ignore, letting it smolder through the many distractions and more enjoyable activities we encounter on the daily on our small homestead.&nbsp; We have done our best to keep our heads down and mind our own business in this new society that they are building; we did not give up on the fight entirely, but instead, we found our own way to make a better life and build a stronger, healthier community as we understood it.&nbsp; And while minding your own business, living simply and living poor may be enough to keep the more traditional corporate interests from invading one’s chosen lifestyle, no such guarantee exists when it comes to keeping your health and happiness protected from State interference.</p>
<p>In the middle of April, my wife received a jury summons.&nbsp; As one is instructed to promptly return the card if seeking a deferral or excusal within five business days, I wasted no time and wrote “nursing mother” and “no child care” on the card.&nbsp; Thus, it was much to my chagrin that we received a reply towards the end of the following week that said no such excuse or deferral was warranted for such reasons.&nbsp; To clarify upfront, we are not opposed to jury duty or civic responsibilities.&nbsp; And despite the social contract being shaken to the core over the last few years, I would still serve on a jury if I were summoned.&nbsp; Likewise, my wife too would rise to the occasion and embrace her civic duty if it were reasonable and practical.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But under the current laws and codes in the State of Washington, the ability to serve in place of another person with more important obligations is not an option.&nbsp; And as the nice lady on the Clark County Judiciary department hotline informed me, “nursing mother and “no childcare” are not valid exemptions from service.&nbsp; She did offer us a six-month deferral, but we declined as we hope to still be nursing our youngest child as long as possible.&nbsp; To agree to a six-month deferral would in a sense, be a form of consent, or a contract, to fulfill the civic obligation six months later, forcing the same confrontation without the ability to petition for a redress of our grievances.</p>
<p>Correct me if I am wrong, but I believe that at one time you said on one of your YouTube videos that (and I am paraphrasing here) “it’s not that people’s rights won’t exist or that the system is going to disappear.&nbsp; It’s that the rights and the system will be so far removed from people’s lives they will not be able to access their rights, they won’t know how.”&nbsp; Well, that statement stuck with me and when my wife was summoned to jury duty and we were informed that the basic, most simplest of rights (those of a nursing mother with an infant child) were now called into question by the State, you could say that I am now actively investigating all the power that I still have as a citizen to find the system and use the rights that I still have before they become so mired in muck that I lack the energy to wade into the cesspool, let alone muster up a halfway decent defense to the overreach of State power.</p>
<p>This is it.&nbsp; This issue has emerged as a new line in the sand that has been drawn.&nbsp; This is the kind of opportunity to fight and stand for what is right and what is just that may only come along so many times in a person’s life.&nbsp; This is the moment that I choose to rise and step out of the shadows and into the light.&nbsp; This is my time.</p>
<p>Thank you for blazing the trail and lighting the way for people like me who just need to know that people like you are out there.&nbsp; We are only humans; we are not perfect by any means.&nbsp; And where this fight leads me is still undetermined, a bit of a mystery.&nbsp; But without a doubt, I know in my heart that compelling a woman to be separated from her breastfeeding infant at the threat of a misdemeanor criminal charge is the type of State violence that far eclipses even the worst of corporate injustices we’ve incurred thus far.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How to prove to the State that their actions are in fact a form of uncoerced violence against the constituency, well, I am still refining my strategy to be honest.&nbsp; So far, the defense has taken shape into an aggressive letter writing campaign, but I sense an escalation is in the works as this pivotal event is helping bring me out of my shell and into the eye of the public.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, it is with much excitement that I look forward to sharing with you the developments in this case as they happen.&nbsp; And equally so, it is with much gratitude that I look forward to collaborating with you and writing and making art and growing our garden and dancing with a deepening and growing love of life, all-natural life.</p>
<p>Respectfully yours,</p>

<p>My email archive contains dozens of postings in which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heather_Armstrong">Heather Armstrong</a>* and I are among those writing, receiving, mentioning, mentioned, cc’d or otherwise included. Most postings are from the ’00s and between bloggers in the brief age before media got social and blogging was still hot shit. Heather, with her&nbsp;<a href="https://dooce.com/">Dooce</a>&nbsp;blog, was the alpha among us, but never snotty about it.</p>
<p>Heather wore her heart, her head, her life, on the Web page. At humorous, opinionated, and wince-worthy self-disclosure, Heather even out-raged&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Locke">Chris Locke</a>, aka <a href="http://www.rageboy.com/blogger.html">RageBoy</a>. Heather, Chris and I might have met for <a href="https://seanpatrickcoon.com/2006/03/13/sxsw2006_day_4_cluetrain_seven_years_later/">a panel</a> at the 2006 SXSW, had Chris made the trip. Wrote Chris, “I was nearly as bummed as Doc said he was that I wasn’t there in Austin today on the ‘Cluetrain: Seven Years Later’ panel. What can I say? If God had wanted people to fly, he would have given them upgrades.” Best I recall, that panel was the only time I met Heather in person. She was fun.</p>
<p>Her&nbsp;<a href="https://dooce.com/2023/04/06/youre-the-one-that-i-wanted-to-find/">final post</a> was on April 6. It is mostly about, and for, her daughter Leta Louise. The closing line is “Here at 18 months sober, I salute my 18-year-old frog baby, she who taught me how to love.” According to news reports, Heather had fallen off the wagon. Whatever the reason, she fell all the way, and we will be forever lessened by her loss.</p>
 
<p>*On her <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dooce/">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dooce/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/dooce">Twitter</a> accounts, all branded Dooce, she identified as Heather B. Hamilton, her birth name.</p>

<p>In this episode of The Identity Nexus, Michael Becker talks with Daniel Goldscheider, the Founder of the OpenWallet Foundation, a nonprofit focused on the governance, development, and deployment of open-source software for SmartWallets, i.e., “OpenWallets.” OpenWallets will have a bigger impact on society than open web browsers. SmartWallets are applications and cloud services that empower people to take gradual control of their identities, licenses, certifications, and personal data as they navigate their phygital life, and they enable organizations to manage the verifiable authority that they delegate to their agents—humans, machines, bots, APIs, and more. OpenWallets are SmartWallets built with community-governed open-source software and global industry standards. In this interview, you’ll learn about the OpenWallet Foundation, the benefits of open-source SmartWallet capabilities, and how to get involved (Here is a hint: it is open, and it is free to contribute and use code; there is a nominal fee for commercial organizations to participate in the community governance).</p>

<p>I asked <a href="https://chat.openai.com/">ChatGPT</a> for a three-day itinerary to give visitors to Santa Barbara. Here ya go:</p>
<p>Day 1:</p>
 
 Start the day with breakfast at the Shoreline Beach Cafe, which has a beautiful view of the ocean. 
 After breakfast, head to Knapp’s Castle for a scenic hike and exploration of the ruins of a 20th century mansion. The hike offers stunning views of the Santa Ynez Valley. 
 For lunch, grab some sandwiches or salads from the nearby Panino’s, a local favorite with fresh, high-quality ingredients. 
 Spend the afternoon exploring downtown Santa Barbara, with its charming shops and cafes. Don’t miss a visit to the Santa Barbara County Courthouse, a stunning Spanish Colonial Revival building with a beautiful clock tower that offers a panoramic view of the city. 
 For dinner, head to Tee-Off, a local institution that has been serving up classic American fare since 1949. 
 
<p>Day 2:</p>
 
 Start the day with a hike up La Cumbre Peak, which offers stunning views of Santa Barbara and the Channel Islands. 
 For lunch, grab some tacos from La Super-Rica Taqueria, a casual spot that was a favorite of Julia Child. 
 Spend the afternoon exploring the Santa Barbara Botanic Garden, which showcases native plants and offers a peaceful escape from the city. 
 For dinner, head to the Stagecoach Inn, a historic restaurant that serves up classic American fare in a cozy setting. 
 
<p>Day 3:</p>
 
 Start the day with breakfast at Jeannine’s Bakery, a local favorite known for its delicious baked goods and breakfast items. 
 Spend the morning at Hendry’s Beach, a local favorite with beautiful views and great walking trails. 
 For lunch, grab some sandwiches or salads from South Coast Deli, a local favorite with fresh ingredients and creative flavor combinations. 
 Spend the afternoon exploring the Santa Barbara Museum of Art, which features a diverse collection of artwork from around the world. 
 For dinner, head back to downtown Santa Barbara and choose from one of the many restaurants in the area, depending on your preference. Some options include Olio e Limone Ristorante, Los Agaves, and The Lark. 
 
<p>I wouldn’t disagree with any of it, except maybe to note that Hendry’s Beach at sunset (where and when I shot the photo above) is mighty fine.</p>
<p>Of course, the answer will vary with every regeneration, but what the hell. It’s very early in our co-evolution with whatever the hell we and AI are together becoming.</p>

<p>The following is a guest post about blockchained wellbeing metrics promoted as an inclusive, emerging tech spiritual practice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May 2023</p>
<p>Hi Alison,</p>
<p>A couple of days ago a friend of mine sent me a screenshot of a conference being held in Paris that a member of the alternative health and freedom space was promoting on her instagram account. My friend’s comment was; “This looks shady, no?” I assured her that yes indeed, it was very shady, and I went straight to the website of the conference and started speed reading my way through it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alison, you have been saying all along that this new paradigm of AI-run extended reality inhabited by a digitally-twinned, re-brained, blockchained, semi-lobotomized populace would ride in cloaked in the mantle of spiritual evolution. I have long been pretty grossed out by aspects of the “spiritual” community for many reasons, but this conference takes it to the next level. The fact that someone from the “resistance” (you’re right, everything does need air quotes now) was gushing about it on her instagram account was a depressing reminder of how when a wolf is wearing the right outfit, even really smart people fail to see the disguise.</p>
<p>The conference is coming up on May 12-13, 2023, and it will be live-streamed. I wish it was free, that way I could sit there and watch and listen with my face all contorted without giving them any of my hard earned fake money. I may bite the bullet anyway. This conference is called <a href="https://www.paua.life/">PAUA</a>, which interestingly is a Maori word for the shell of a mollusk or abalone. It makes me think of the term ‘ a shell of a man’. An empty shell of a man…a robot maybe? Or someone so removed from themself that they’re no longer recognizable? I don’t know.</p>
<a href="https://www.paua.life/"></a>Source Link: <a href="https://www.paua.life/">https://www.paua.life/</a>
<p>The two-day program ping pongs back and forth between artificial intelligence, ancient wisdom, Web3, Mother Earth, the metaverse, planetary consciousness, conscious capital, and of course…psychedelics. There is also a strong, and exploitative, emphasis on the Kogi people, a very private indigenous tribe who live deep in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta mountains of Northern Columbia and have been dodging colonization and clinging to their sacred and traditional way of life since at least the 15th century. The dragging of two of their leaders to Paris to help woke-wash their next-gen colonization tactics is weirdly reminiscent of the Native American chiefs put on display at the world’s fairs of the late 1800’s. It seems the token economy extends itself to include the tokenizing of the native people used as hood ornaments for the robotic Trojan horse.</p>
<p>From the event’s homepage:</p>
<p>“As we enter into this new decade of the twenties, we have the opportunity to reintegrate ancient knowledge into our modern civilization to create a new narrative for humanity that offers a positive view of the future of our civilization. PAUA is about creating connections between the material world and the spiritual realms, making visible the invisible while featuring an exploration into a wide range of ancient knowledge. PAUA will explore the future of Web3, the Metaverse, and AI, as well as how consciousness can be the fundamental basis for conducting business, Apps, and self transformation”&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don’t know about you, but for me reading that paragraph felt like all of a sudden a turd bobbed up from the bottom of my cup as I peacefully stirred it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So let’s get into the speakers. The lineup starts off with a bang.</p>
<p>Yat Siu is the co-founder and executive chairman of the global blockchain and gaming leader <a href="https://www.animocabrands.com/">Animoca Brands</a>. Yat has many accolades including being a World Economic Forum Global Leader of Tomorrow. This should have triggered a pause for many in the alternative sphere if they had taken a few moments to look into the first highlighted speaker of the event.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Animoca has many blockchain gaming projects in its portfolio, but a few of the standouts for me are TinyTap, bringing education to Web3, with over 200,000 activities and courses, like “math path” and “my life skills box” that feature such lessons as “I go to the bathroom” and “I blow my nose.” Educators own their content by minting their course as an NFT which they can host or sell on a subject domain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Learners” from childhood to college will be able to store their certificates in their blockchain wallets, gain a lifelong record of their achievements, and earn access passes. Imagine having a token for having mastered “how to blow your nose” follow you around for the rest of your life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other projects are the Mocaverse where the dreamer, builder, angel, connector and neo-capitalist tribes converge to learn, play, do good, and build a more “equitable and inclusive” Web3 together. It also features “Life Beyond” where you buy land, start your own society, and try to keep the nanobot invasions from wiping out your civilization. Other games involve speeding hotrods through city streets (Animoca teamed up with Google to utilize google maps (and I’m sure soon Google Earth, right?), so the speeding frenzy could take place in real time on real streets. It makes me wonder if one day in the near future&nbsp; someone from the open metaverse crashing into you as you rumble along in your physical reality could have a real world impact? Like those helmets where you die in real life if your avatar kicks the bucket. I could go on and on, but I need to keep moving.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tim Chang is a partner at the Mayfield Fund, focusing on venture capital investments in consumer internet, digital media, ecommerce/marketplace, and health/wellness. He has twice been named on the Midas list of top 100 VCs. Tim led Mayfield’s investments in MOAT (acquired by Oracle), and Basis (acquired by Intel). Tim was previously a partner at Norwest Venture Partners where he led NVP’s investments in Playdom (acquired by Disney), and AdChina (acquired by Alibaba). Tim received a MBA from Stanford School of Business. His venture capital specialties include quantified self/life, digital communities/media/gaming, digital health and wellness, smarthome and connected devices/IoT.</p>
<p>Tim also sits on the board of Reimagine, a non profit that “exists to help people of all backgrounds face adversity, loss, and mortality, and channel the hard parts of life into meaningful growth and action.” They understand the “science” of PTSD” and have come up with a “virtuous cycle” where you’re taught “five steps to becoming the hero of your own journey.” First you’re “educated” on how to flourish. Then you learn how to “regulate” your emotions with the help of a coach. Next you share your grief in a “safe environment,” while AI hoovers up your agony like a meth addict in the background. Finally, you chart new goals and become of service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To do this God’s work the Reimagine team hired an external software development team to create mock-ups of the entire user experience. Implementing an on-going “co-creation” process with members of their community. The firm incorporated feedback from surveys, interviews, and focus groups into the design; and then they partnered with a renowned game designer to craft a seamless user experience for the traumatized data sources. Through this interface subjects wo;; write down the most difficult and intimate details of their anguish, along with goals and actions intended to “snap them out of it” and create new “journeys” on digital dashboards. Once that program is in place, participants will be nudged back to their forced happy place. The Reimagine board alone is worthy of several pages of analysis, but I need to stay on track.</p>

<p>Next up is Nichol Bradford. Nichol is the founder and CEO of the Willow Group working to trigger “transformative collisions by providing the most effective and accessible technologies for creating permanent, positive shifts in peace of mind, mental balance, life satisfaction, and happiness.” Their mission is to permanently move a billion people into a state of fundamental well being and flourishing by 2030. Nichol also founded a company called Transformative Tech that claims to be the only global platform connecting founders with investors, resources, and tools to succeed in the “well being tech industry.”</p>
<p>Nichol is a graduate of the Singularity University global solutions program, has an MBA from Wharton School of Business in strategy, and a BBA in marketing from the University of Houston. Bradford is also a fellow of the British American Project. See the quote below taken from that organization’s website: “I want to make the case that a trans-Atlantic leadership network like BAP is exceptionally well positioned to exert a potentially game-changing, tipping-point influence in the future that is unfolding.” The statement was made by Dr. Barbara Stephenson, Dean of the leadership and management school of the Foreign Service Institute who is on the board of the Brandon Marshall foundation for Mental Health and a former member of the Council on Foreign Relations.&nbsp; <a href="http://nicholbradford.com/"></a></p>

<p>So far so good right? I feel closer to ascension already.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moving right along to Linda Adami, founder and CEO of <a href="https://quantumtemple.xyz/">Quantum Temple</a>. Her interests include: Cultural Heritage Preservation, Web3, impact, and inclusion. Linda is an impact strategist who spent 10 years in emerging markets across Central America, South-East Asia, and the Gulf. She graduated with honors from King’s College, London and completed a three-month program at MIT Media Labs. Her company, Quantum Temple, is a Web3 platform “preserving” cultural heritage. Their mission is to develop the first decentralized record of cultural heritage and unlock regenerative impact funding powered by Web3. “We enable equitable exchanges between conscious collectors and ancestral communities through blockchain technology”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I checked out Quantum Temple’s website. In the simplest terms this is what I see. It’s selling NFTs of the essence of cultural heritage sites. You login and connect your wallet, then you validate your identity and start bidding on the little slice of cultural heritage you wish to stick in your wallet. An example of how this works is “On the full moon of the fourth month.” That’s the name of the NFT.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s the full story:</p>
<p>Once a decade, on the full moon of the fourth month a stone is brought from the village of Manukaya to be bathed in the waters of the sacred pool of Tirtha Empul. The stone is carved with an inscription in old Balinese, a language no longer spoken, deciphered in the 1920s. It records King Chandrabhayasingha Warmmadewa’s construction of the bathing pools in the year 962 AD, on the full moon of the fourth month. Thus the connection between the stone and the pool has remained unbroken for more than a thousand years. The waters from the pool flow to the ancient royal tombs and monasteries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right now the bidding is at 1.0633 eth ($2,000).&nbsp;</p>
<p>What does one get, and who makes the money from that sale? Forty percent goes to Quantum Temple and another forty percent goes to the “culture keepers” of the temple. In this case it is a young man and his father who keep the temple clean and lead the guests’ sacred cleansing experience. Ten percent goes to the filmmakers who shot the 33 second Mp4, which is the NFT. Five percent goes to the “curator of the experience.” I guess he’s the culture scout. The last five percent goes into an impact fund. So the temple experience, now digitally twinned, lives in some collectors wallet and cultural history is preserved forever.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The End</p>

<p>My plan for this piece was to look into the Web3/AI personalities and point out what should be obvious incongruities between what they’re espousing and the idea of spiritual “up-leveling.” I wanted to sort of glaze over the meditation/consciousness camp with a one-size-fits-all wrap up of their usual bag of labels and objectives. I was trying to get this letter finished, so it didn’t drag it out for multiple days. I guess I was hoping on some level that at least a few of these speakers were actually what they claimed. What I found is&nbsp; that the Web3 crowd is pretty honest about the role they are playing in this grand comedy of horrors. They’re simply draping themselves in the sexy sheer nightie of ultra spiritualism for this particular gig. When they show up at the blockchain bro expo next month I’m sure their language will change, but their objectives will remain dead on. My point being, I was trying to skate quickly past the barefoot, micro-dosing, sound bath whispering light goddesses and just leave them alone, but it wasn’t meant to be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I stuck Amandine Roche’s name into my search engine, and <a href="http://amandineroche.com/">this</a> is what came out…</p>
<p>Amandine Roche is a human rights lawyer and International peace keeper who promotes wellness through meditation and yoga. The list of people who she’s studied her multitude of practices under is like a who’s who of mindfulness and bliss.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She studied mindfulness with Jon Kabat Zinn, who created the ‘Stress Reduction Clinic’ and ‘The Center for Mindfulness in Medicine, Healthcare, and Society’ at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. Kabat Zinn earned a PhD in 1971 at MIT in molecular biology. While at MIT, Kabat Zinn was campaigning against the school’s military research, so in order to quell the student protests, MIT appointed him alongside Noam Chomsky and George Katsiaficas to an advisory panel on the future of the university’s military labs. Kabat Zinn is on the board of the Mind and Life institute.</p>
<p>Roche studied altruism and compassion with Mathieu Ricard (also on the board of the Mind and Life Institute). Ricard received his PhD in molecular genetics from the Pasteur Institute in 1972 before deciding to shuck his scientific career, move to the Himalayas and study Tibetan Buddhism. Ricard has been called the “happiest person in the world’ by several popular media outlets, because they all got the same memo. He volunteered to participate in a University of Wisconson-Madison study on happiness. Sufficeth to say, he scored significantly above average. Ricard has spoken at the United Nations as part of the Gross National Happiness Resolution, the Global Economic Symposium, The World Government Summit, and has been invited to the World Economic Forum ten times.</p>
<p>Roche has also studied with Deepak Chopra, who needs no introduction, but I did take a quick glance at his website and saw that the two most recent additions to his archive are a piece he wrote titled “How AI could set us free,” which was an overly simplistic and incredibly tone deaf piece that concludes “’If AI takes over all the jobs, then that frees up humanity and the obstacles to human potential would be radically lessened… this could amount to a leap in the evolution of consciousness.” His other article was about wireless sensor technology that monitors an individual’s responses while meditating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Roche’s mentor roster and resume of working with the UN, the European Commission, Unicef, UNESCO, UN Women, and USAID, it’s clear to me she’s as big a player in this game as the rest of them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ok, I think I’ve made my point.</p>
<p>I’m not even close to halfway through the list of speakers, but I’ll leave the rest for anybody else who can stomach it. I really just wanted to point out that many folks in the “higher consciousness-focused” community aren’t grasping the disconnect between what they’re absorbing from their gurus and spiritual teachers and what lies on the other side of that gauzy ethereal curtain. How can a conference of this stature, one with an Web3 mindfulness agenda trumpeting from every line of text and every speaker bio, not set off alarm bells for “the resistance?”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seeing someone who’s so embedded in the alternative sphere practically getting the vapors over this glossy, highly funded, Deloitte-sponsored, change agent-driven performance piece swathed in all the right newspeak “justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion,” where phrases like “sacred ancient knowledge” and “higher consciousness” are nothing but clickbait…</p>
<p>This conference was the low hanging fruit I needed to finally write something again. To try to draw some eyes away from the influencers on stage, and bring them round back, to the shit show where they might get a glimpse of the gamified, tokenized cybernetic ant computer. Pull back the gauzy spiritual curtain and see the plan is for everyone to live on blockchain and respond to nudges from wireless sensor networks – from their iPhones, from their tutors, from their health coaches, and from their doctors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want people to see that “wellness” is the base layer cost offset for their impact investing. That they want us “happy” in tiny house communities, fifteen-minute SMART villages run by nuclear reactors airdropped in shipping containers at the edge of town. In this future a majority of people will sit in haptic suits and compete for global gig work, because they’ve been convinced that we live in a “post knowledge” era where humans have few skills that can outperform artificial intelligence. In this future our spiritual ascension comes at a high cost –&nbsp; the complete capture of our every thought, emotion, and desire so the machine can manipulate us into “bliss.” These smug, arrogant change makers from every corner of academia are juicing us up on the idea of there being a utopia around the next corner even as the “open metaverse” stealthily closes in around us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Your Farming Friend Verityhound</p>

<p>This is getting quite tiresome. I am hearing through the grapevine that Ms. Celia Farber, who by her own account is now reliant on the click bait of Substack for her livelihood, is continuing to repackage vague, inaccurate comments as “content” to fuel her digital hive. I have not gone over to <a href="https://celiafarber.substack.com/p/a-challenge-whoever-is-claiming-i">her post</a> to see the vitriol directed at me by her commenters. I’m too busy going through Children’s Health Defense’s IRS Filings to give my attention to her ant computer. Since she is apparently threatening “legal action,” I am taking the precaution to document the fact that the entire hubbub was inadvertently initiated by a <a href="https://celiafarber.substack.com/p/diana-wests-critique-of-mr-jones/comment/15731034">fawning commenter</a>. You’ll see below that “Cosmos” now regrets the submission, one that triggered Farber’s emotional hysteria followed by a reflexive mob response. I have no idea how I got dragged back into the comment section, as there is no evidence that I’ve discussed the queen bee since she pulled me into her arena a few weeks ago, though my efforts to shine a light on Children’s Health Defense finances and staffing could make me a juicy target. I’m aware of the AIDs dissident history generally, but anyone who follows my work knows that is not my focus. I have no clue about the various personalities involved in this discussion. </p>
<p>Once again bad behavior on all sides rules the day (except for the one grounded, clear-thinking person out there apparently – Ian Bell). Please, get a grip on yourselves folks. Go out and blow on some dandelions.</p>

<p>The following was posted as a comment on the blog yesterday, and I am sharing it here with permission. I was tickled by the way the author, who goes by the pen name Meandering Myrmidon, wove hours of my dry content into a charmingly cutting analysis of what is unfolding before our eyes as the Camelot 2.0 campaign gathers steam. </p>
<p>Yesterday, and again this morning, Children’s Health Defense, wrote me that they do not share any information about their donors. As someone who worked at a small nonprofit for seventeen years, I know it is standard practice to prepare an annual report with a list of major donors – even if it is only digital and posted to the website. The IRS 990 filing for Children’s Health Defense indicates a budget of $16,000,000 in 2021. They have a huge online media presence and spin-off publishing and video subsidiaries. There is no excuse for them to have not devoted some of those resources to making their funding available for public review. </p>
<p>With their former chairman, now on leave, running for president, I think we can all expect more transparency than that. I’ll be unpacking this in one or more discussions as soon as I’ve finished pouring over the spreadsheets I’m putting together of CHD’s publicly available financial information and board lists. There are several interesting findings that merit scrutiny from those inclined to support the Camelot campaign with their time or treasure.</p>
<p>In the meantime, enjoy this witty missive. I’m a workhorse researcher whose prose is functional, but rarely sparkles with wit. I keep saying we need artistry to translate this information in a more palatable form. Myrmidon’s poem delivers in spades. One clarification, if this poem is intended to reflect my work, I want to make it clear that no knights have arrived to make me any offers. For that I am glad, as it would be unseemly, and unchivalrous, for any entity to make such an offer, nor would I ever accept. </p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p>-The Once and Future Thing-</p>
<p>Just before cock crow,<br>
in a darkling hotel lobby,<br>
the spectral father cries:<br>
“The hour’s come, avenge me, Bobby!”</p>
<p>And from his crystal palace,<br>
the dynastic chosen son,<br>
doles oxytocin tokens,<br>
to the wronged and innocent ones.</p>
<p>Nobly wounded, audibly shaken,<br>
from scores of giants that he’s felled,<br>
he whispers to the multitude,<br>
what his father’s ghost did tell:</p>
<p>“The salmon will be hooked,<br>
the well of wisdom will be plumbed,<br>
naught will remain unknown,<br>
if we blockchain everyone.”</p>
<p>“Let us now praise famous men,<br>
may their interest forever accrue,<br>
we’ll accept all colors and proclivities,<br>
we can tokenize them too.”</p>
<p>“In our liberated markets,<br>
everyone will have a share,<br>
on this side we’ll make solutions,<br>
and we’ll make problems over there.”</p>
<p>“With tokenized revolutions,<br>
we’ll spin them round and round,<br>
and the energy they generate,<br>
will power the cities and towns.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Join us, the Impedance,<br>
all free agents and entrepreneurs,<br>
just donate your extra electrons,<br>
oh, mega machine, we’re yours!”</p>
<p>“Come now, let’s reforge,<br>
the pact that was broken,<br>
and pay for this succession,<br>
with this non-fungible token”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in his tower,<br>
high above the broad Potomac,<br>
Merlyn gazes in his Palantir,<br>
muttering spells alchemical, gnomic.</p>
<p>Director of the spectacle,<br>
playwright extraordinaire,<br>
Merlyn moves his players about,<br>
charging waves hidden in air.</p>
<p>But Little Alice, scrappy mom,<br>
from the City of the Broken Bell,<br>
raised her voice among the throng,<br>
warning all was not so well:</p>
<p>“They say I’m nuts”, said Alice<br>
“they say I’m not quite sane,<br>
for thinking people are not pawns,<br>
and that life is not a game.”</p>
<p>“I’ve been into the labyrinth,<br>
and gathered many threads,<br>
I’ve woven them together,<br>
and this is what they said.”</p>
<p>She then unrolled a tapestry,<br>
showing the lords of every land,<br>
hunting for a quarry,<br>
that they could not understand.</p>
<p>In the center was a unicorn,<br>
the quested after game,<br>
in magenta script thereon was stitched:<br>
“BEHOLD: THE GLOBAL BRAIN”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Merlyn, in his tower,<br>
quickly consulted his chart,<br>
of every outcome and income,<br>
to find Little Alice’s part.</p>
<p>He directed a trusted knight,<br>
of the Children’s Health Crusade,<br>
to entice Little Alice,<br>
with the sums she could be paid.</p>
<p>Alas, to no avail,<br>
the crusader wooed in vain,<br>
stubborn and immovable,<br>
Alice’s tale remained the same.</p>
<p>Merlyn, in his wrath, demands:<br>
“who let this thistle grow?,<br>
this pissabed that’s sprouted from,<br>
my neatly tended row”.</p>
<p>So the master of illusion,<br>
broadcasts more at which to stare,<br>
he invokes his spell most tried and true:<br>
“Hey, you, look over there!”</p>
<p>Spectacular scenes emerge,<br>
like toadstools after rain,<br>
hairy men in queenly drag,<br>
war, disease, exploding trains.</p>
<p>All the tricks long utilized,<br>
to hypnotize the peasants,<br>
and I don’t know what happened next,<br>
this hasn’t passed, it’s present.</p>

<p>Below is an email shared with permission. I hear there’s a tempest in a teapot with my name on it in some unspecified Substack. Well, I suppose something is benefitting from the energy generated by the emotional outrage machine. I suppose as long as I’m shining a light on Camelot 2.0 that is to be expected. This was sitting on the back burner for a few weeks, but for any new folks popping over to see what I’m about, I consider what follows a very generous endorsement of my character. Thank you Internet glitch friend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>April 2023</p>
<p>Dear Alison,</p>
<p>So on occasion I go through my phone storage and try to delete what is no longer relevant and go over stuff I’ve screen-saved in the moment b/c what ever has spoke to me, etc. </p>
<p>Sometimes things come back around and perhaps has more than one purpose. For example this, what I am about to share because we are all stumbling through the labyrinth of life, on our own, and collectively, is like an egg. </p>
<p>An egg has seemingly three separate parts that make up the whole. Do we eat the whole egg? No. We take the part that we like, the part that sustains us, discard the rest and go on our way. Do we give it a second thought? No. Was the shell useless? No. It all served a purpose for what we needed at that moment in time. </p>
<p>Why am I saying all this? I am making this point, because I am sick and tired of irrelevant people on the internet of space who are energy zappers. They offer nothing of substance. They aren’t even a useful shell; they’re worse. They’re like the toothpick that comes along and pokes a tiny hole in the bottom of your egg just to blow out all the nutritional content and leave this empty shell. Some might even add insult to injury and decorate the shell and call it art. Maybe that’s useful for some other people in their time and space, but imagine you were in a group of travelers who desperately relied on those eggs to sustain their bodies nutritionally so that the brain and the body could endure the long complicated journey ahead. When life was less complicated, and lives were more comfortable, predictable, perhaps even a bit boring, the idea of an empty egg with a painted shell might be more entertained. Time and place I suppose. </p>
<p>Or just find your lane. Don’t be a cheerleader for the shell art following a group of folks that crack their eggs right through the middle so you can scream at them for how stupid they are just discarding the shell. In your shell art world sure, the egg eaters might seem so selfish, (shell~fish lol), so careless, so unimaginably weird that they’ve learned how to best use that egg for themselves. But don’t entertain that idea, that concept, that world view. No way. Egg eaters are all about themselves. They aren’t pretty and decorated and put on display for all to put on a shelf and admire. No. Maybe the egg eaters put a few of their eggs together, added some cheddar, chillis, ham, milk, potatoes, so that more people could come together and share new recipes and enjoy the experience together. The egg eaters like to share their recipes with others who might not like that recipe but love this recipe, and so it goes. </p>
<p>But the egg eaters don’t like bad eggs. You know the ones. The eggs that kids might hide in the bottom drawer of the refrigerator a few months before Halloween. Yet another use for an egg. Completely deplorable for the shell decorators, unimaginable to the egg eaters, but to the mischievous energy filled youth…rotten eggs are the PERFECT accessory on Halloween night to be the miserable coup d’etat to some unsuspecting homeowner. The egg rotters, they too see their egg group as the golden egg group, scoffing at the eaters and the artisans. For the purpose of the egg rotters is to thrive in spreading misery towards others. Fortunately this group is few and far between, usually. Does it mean they don’t exist? No. We know they are there, lurking in the shadows, ready to pounce. Generally we each are aware of the other and manage to coexist naturally and maybe rarely if ever cross paths. </p>
<p>Well that being said… if a rotten egg happens to catch your house, sure it stinks. Yes they suck. Do they know you? Probably not. They probably just think it’s funny amongst themselves, and you are just who the flying fickle finger of fate poked that day. To the homeowner that’s worked hard to own and maintain their home, a messy smelling egg can be embarrassing and will want to wash it off immediately at move on. Egg eaters aren’t smelly rotten people so it’s a personal insult to have to now take precious time out of a normally productive and fulfilling day to have to now direct that otherwise forward moving useful energy to this stinking rotten mess. Washed off, yet the negative smell still lingers. The egg rotters have moved on from their follies. Probably haven’t given your house a second thought. It was funny for them at that moment, just that one night, your house with no constructive reason or rhyme, to pelt that egg thru the air, and in its smashed glory to laugh at the success of the aim and move on. Yes, their job is done. They move on. </p>
<p>The eater though wonders why. Why was my house chosen? What did I ever do to them? I don’t even have a son so who pissed them off? Why wasn’t I like my neighbours house who survived the night eggless? Why now does my beautiful house now stink? The eater doesn’t understand it because not only are the rotters the most useless users of the egg, worse, they somehow manage to use their eggs to literally drain your positive, productive most forward and proactive users of the egg people.. the rotters add zero to anyone or anything and yet that little impulse moment of theirs causes such a disruption to others. There’s no point trying to understand these mindless, boundless energetic little imps. They have all this energy to run around destroying things, because they don’t have to think constructively about their actions. They don’t have a creation of their own to show for. They don’t have pride in their project that they can show to others in a year, in two years, in five years etc.. Their destruction is done. After their small group has had their smash and laugh, that’s it. They’re done. Their lives are pointless and maybe they wish they could be like the egg eaters. To have something they could be proud of. A community that grows painstakingly slow, but eventually flourishes beautifully. Day after day, month after month, the egg eaters grow into a group, then a community and hopefully someday a movement. Not everyone understands what the eaters’ purpose is exactly, but being a part of it feels good. </p>
<p>Wanting to join in the community feels purposeful. Maybe individually eaters don’t have all the recipes, maybe the eaters don’t have all the ingredients. Sometimes we don’t even know if we like eating our egg in a new and different way until we try. But we don’t even know there’s a different way to eat that egg until we stumble upon this amazing community that embraces everyone. Sure the eaters are busy with their own eggs, but on Thursday night they all gather around the community stove, crack a few eggs and relish and grow together. Thursday nights renew the community’s energy and purpose. By and large the community feels right. And it grows. For the end all be all purpose is still out there, but at least in this small community, a shared experience is being built. It’s being realised. It’s being a constant in the inconsistency of current life. Maybe it’s just another day for the eater, but for the new member eater it’s opening up a profound new world of tools and ingredients to eventually be confident enough to become creative too and then maybe even be able to also share with the community. </p>
<p>Who knows. I don’t. I don’t even know the first egg eater that started this community. Who is Alison? I don’t know. Who is Donald Trump? I don’t know. Who is Madonna? Who is Stew Peters or Tucker Carlson? Do I personally know any of these people? No. Do I consume their content, yes. Does that make me know them, no. Do I like everything they put out there? No, most likely not. But at some level I am able to gather enough content to sort out in my own head some type of character this person makes up. Sure that character can change over time. We all do. That doesn’t mean at this time because they were this that now they can’t be that. That’s stupid and ridiculous. We are all constantly changing. Hopefully for the better. So as long as that persons’ character whose content I am consuming is seemingly aligning with my personal path, journey through the labyrinth, is resonating my life, opening up my mind, then yes, for that moment, oh yeah I know who Alison is….</p>
<p>She’s that nutty keyboard brainiac in Philly with a husband and a kid and a small house and a huge library. She reads a lot, she talks a lot, she’s super intelligent, but she probably doesn’t realise her own value as it’s just her. She doesn’t go around trying to force people to listen to her or join her dandelion club. Pay to hear this magical opinion…nope. She’s like, hey, there’s a hole in this boat we are all occupying right now and if we put our heads together maybe we can fix it even though the boat is floating in the middle of the ocean and filled with people. If it doesn’t get addressed everyone in the boat is screwed. She doesn’t need praises for spotting the hole or collating various repair manuals. She just knows that fixing the problem is going to take more than just her, and she’s really grateful when someone else also sees the hole and offers to help with the solution. Does that make Alison now somehow eternally tied in gratitude for that individual that came along side to help, no. Sometimes is okay just to appreciate that this person has come across your path for a reason maybe the reason is for yourself or it’s for them. Who knows? I don’t know. </p>
<p>I don’t even know who Alison is. I will probably never ever meet her in real life. If I do, alright, cool, that means the world didn’t end. LoL . Whatever. Am I a brainiac just like her? Ha! Not even close. I do know what stupid is, and I’m not that either. I can however imho feel like I can gather who their character is…or what makes up the value of their character. Am I a mom? Yes. Okay, I can relate. Did I graduate college, yes, okay I can relate. Am I looking for answers to an unknown question or questions? Boom! Do I know who Alison is? No, but I really like her character. What she puts out makes sense to me. What she says has immeasurable value, to me. What she has said in the past is STILL TRUE and still of value…to me. Would we be friends in real life if I lived down her street? Maybe. Best friends, probably not. I respect her. I admire her ability to carry this proverbial torch that we all enjoy the benefit of… Is she replaceable? Probably. But she’s grown on me. And if I just respect and value what this Alison character puts out there I can say yes, I know who Alison is and she’s my friend. She’s one of a kind, unique, qwirky yet stable. She does not make up or spread rumours or lies. Indeed the polar opposite. She lights up when discussing facts and building the base file of totally relevant pieces that need to come together so everyone can see the whole picture. </p>
<p>Can she be attacked just because she’s there, sure. Does it hurt? You bet. Was there a point to that? Idk, maybe. But now that rotten egg has made this ripple, an after shock if you will to the rest of us in the community who actually do value this Alison character. Her tappity tap tapping keyboard in the background of board meetings as her questions rage onto her targets that do their very best to make so much noise, say so many words yet answer nothing. See, this is why I like Alison. This is why I respect and value this Alison character, and it seriously pisses me the fuck off when miserable negative parasite losers take aim her. It is not her responsibility to be everyone’s mom just because she is a mom. Nor does she have to validate herself or worth to each and every one of you. Like the rest of us you either can see from a mile away (or across the pond) that this Alison person is super bright, maybe if I pay attention I can learn something from her that in turn will help me too! Or since she can’t stop her life and coddle my shallow empty invisible spec internet personality then I’ll just throw my rotten egg guts at her. Because I can’t be her, I can just ruin all the good she’s doing. But that ripple rolls out doesn’t it. And after so many ripples it’s easy to question why even bother? This is so much work, so much energy. Sure I opted to do it because I was interested, then I realised it was important to share, I thought what I was doing was benevolent and being a positive value in the lurking panopticon assembly of doom… Yes, your negative (albeit shallow pointless keyboard stabs) remarks hurt and after enough of them cause a pause and question why do I even bother. </p>
<p>Well I’ll tell you why, because to loads of anonymous people out there that happen across your content actually do appreciate you. There are those of us scattered across the big floating globe of billions of people-ants that catch that faint pheromone hit and say wait a minute, hold up, there is something familiar and comforting about this scent. And so it is. A few years ago I began my search for answers to the crazy phenomenon that had taken the world by surprise. I knew enough to know it was bullshit even if I couldn’t articulate exactly why. But I knew. Now then in my drive to gather the words to validate and articulate my story I’m having to learn loads of information, people and names, concepts, ideas, facts and opinions. Are there hard answers, yes. Did I find them? No. But I sorted my own path in a way in which made the most sense to me and that’s what matters. </p>
<p>So to make a long story longer – and I’m so sorry, I just thought you might like to hear why you matter or why people even bother listening to you or whatever. It’s just me, your random internet content consumer letting you in on why you matter… to me. To my story. What makes you, YOU in my story and why I find you compelling and valid. By the way this has happened with you on my phone not just this once, but a few times. So much so that I’m like whatever, she’s not exactly lights and whistles or an entertaining production. To appreciate Alison is to tune into her broadcasts, pay attention, hell, here’s a concept-take notes. Go back and re-listen (which I usually have to do with your stuff) try and grasp what is being said, shared, made perfectly available to your very fingertips with ease, because that is what Alison does. It’s like the concert violinist in the subway station. People dismiss the beauty and value of the melody because it’s being shared out of the love and joy of the music. Not being ‘stingy’ or shared ‘narcissistically’ at £1,000.00 /seat to hear me play. People create concrete paths and demand you must make yourself miserable too. It’s how it is you know. My life’s story says life must be hard must be complicated must be difficult so I command you to do the same. What-Ev-Errrr. </p>
<p>Soooooo going back to my phone storage, playing sound bytes I deemed to have value, I get a chuckle like yep, this is why I like this Alison character b/c time and time again I get the first clip and I’m like wait, what? What am I suppose to do with that? What’s that suppose to mean for me or to me? Wtf am I watching this shit for if I’m left feeling out ragged and filled with unanswered questions? Why tf do I bother?! Ugh! Then seriously, 12 hours later, oh here’s that Alison character. I’m never quite sure what she’s on about but she is on to something though. At least she provokes me to think. At least she gives me a direction to look or search or dig. But sometimes, sometimes you get lucky and she just gives you the answer in plain sight. She doesn’t even know you’re looking for it. But she does give you the answers. I think people are too busy making their own life more complicated that they don’t take the time to see it’s right there. So here, let me share, because you can enjoy this and know that the work and reach you put out there in the internet abyss is landing on some pretty decent minds. </p>
<p>Literally look at the meta-data screenshots- it was about two years ago, yeah, and literally 12 hours apart…. This still amuses me to this day, and now I hope you get a kick out of it too. Your blast from my past LoL… You know I think I’m going to put them in another email b/c it screws up my phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
    
<p>Cheers from the expat American across the pond. Thank you for being you – whoever you are . </p>
<p>Sincerely, your random anonymous internet friend or not or glitch or whatever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My reply:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh my. I’m tickled. What an image you weave with the eggs! Did you know I eat a lot of eggs? We get a dozen in our farm box every week. Two poached on sauteed greens with garlic is my current fave (bring the water in the pan to a rolling boil, drop in a good splash of vinegar, then crack two eggs directly into the water, turn down the heat a bit, after a few minutes scoop each one out with a slotted spoon, and place on a towel to dab them dry, serve over greens with pepper). It would be nice to meet in person. I’m sure we would enjoy one another’s company. Given all the effort, would you like to share this with a broader audience on the blog? It’s fine either way. I do appreciate the time you took to lay out your thoughts and include me in your thinking. We are growing a little community, aren’t we?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ran out of greens, but homemade bread toasted works well, too.</p>

  This article shows how to force phishing resistant authentication for external B2B users using a cross tenant trust. The external users are from a separate tenant and the local tenant needs to trust the multiple factor authentication (MFA) from the other known tenants. This prevents the user having to authenticate again and setup more MFA. […]

<p>This article shows how to force phishing resistant authentication for external B2B users using a cross tenant trust. The external users are from a separate tenant and the local tenant needs to trust the multiple factor authentication (MFA) from the other known tenants. This prevents the user having to authenticate again and setup more MFA.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCoreAzureADCAE/tree/main/RazorCaePhishingResistant">https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCoreAzureADCAE/tree/main/RazorCaePhishingResistant</a></p>



<p></p>



<p>The demo application requires that administrators use a phishing resistant MFA and this is implemented using an Azure AD authentication context with a policy. The tenant and the application was setup as shown in the blog: </p>



<p><a href="https://damienbod.com/2022/10/10/force-phishing-resistant-authentication-in-an-asp-net-core-application-using-azure-ad/">Force phishing resistant authentication in an ASP.NET Core application using Azure&nbsp;AD</a></p>



<p></p>



<p>If a local member authenticates using a phishing resistant MFA, the user can access the admin page without problem. </p>



<p>When an external member or a guest user authenticates, the user will be shown the following page requesting that the user authenticates again with a correct MFA. This is displayed even if the user has authenticated correctly on the home tenant. No trust exists between the Azure AD tenants.</p>







<p></p>



<p>To fix this, the Azure tenant must trust the multiple factor authentication from the other tenants. This can be implemented using Azure AD external identities. </p>



<p></p>







<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>Now when the user authenticates, everything will work.</p>



<p></p>



<p>One problem which still exists is for Microsoft accounts. These users cannot authenticate with the step up requirement.</p>

<p>MITREid Connect was, at one time, one of the top open source implementations of OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0. Written in Java and targeted for enterprise systems in the days before cloud services, it fit a niche and did it well. Where is it today and where is it&nbsp;going?</p>The unofficial OpenID Connect logo I drew one afternoon that became the symbol for the&nbsp;project. How It&nbsp;Started <p>Back in what feels like the long-distant past, I started a research project at my then-employer to investigate federated identity and how it could be applied in our environments.</p><p>We started out by building a very slapdash but functional implementation of OpenID 2.0 (and its various extensions, like SREG and AX), and we called it MITREid because I’m not great at coming up with good names. This little experimental server got hooked into our enterprise identity management system, and it did a pretty good job at giving us a single-sign-on experience that wasn’t just prompting for the user’s password and checking against LDAP, like every other app at the time had been&nbsp;doing.</p><p>When OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect started development, I proposed a research project that would get us involved in the creation of those standards and come up with an implementation of them that we could use ourselves and give back to the community as an open source project. The result of this was the <a href="https://github.com/mitreid-connect/OpenID-Connect-Java-Spring-Server/">MITREid Connect</a> project, with its flagship OpenID Connect IdP and OAuth 2.0 AS built as a Java Spring application. And as you can see, my skill at naming projects continues to shine&nbsp;here.</p> How It&nbsp;Went <p>We built MITREid Connect to fit into much the same kind of environment that the original MITREid OpenID 2.0&nbsp;server.</p>  No internal user management, this would be handled by the corporate identity management system and plugged in through a service&nbsp;layer  Pluggable authentication, so we could adapt it to whatever the corporate system and our customer environments had in place&nbsp;already  Strict adherence to the standards, and a decent attempt to implement as much of them as we could&nbsp;manage  Deployable in a Java servlet container, which is the kind of deployment we had readily available to us at the&nbsp;time  <p>All of these goals shaped the project that came out of the research effort, and it was decently successful for its time. We released several major revisions of the project, implemented new-fangled security mechanisms like PKCE, and deployed it to both our corporate network and a number of other systems. It gave us login, API access, and a common security layer right at a time when things were shifting away from HTTP Basic Auth for everything.</p><p>When the OpenID Foundation started to make their conformance testing available, we were among the first to certify and submit our results. I even have the t-shirt to prove&nbsp;this!</p><p>While I was still an employee at MITRE, the MITREid Connect project was funded largely through the research program that started it. When I first founded <a href="https://bspk.io/">Bespoke Engineering</a> and started consulting full time, I fully expected that support, development, and deployment of MITREid Connect was going to be one of my major business lines, and that this would help the project continue. This was slightly true at first, with several large clients bringing me on board to help work on larger projects that were making use of MITREid Connect. However, most of my time on these projects was spent not on the MITREid Connect code itself, but on separate or larger parts of the overall&nbsp;project.</p><p>Not long after I left MITRE, some folks at <a href="https://web.mit.edu/">MIT</a> offered to host the project as part of a new consortium. This was a good relationship, but they couldn’t offer the kind of support for an engineering team that the MITRE research program once afforded. That consortium eventually folded into something else, and the MITREid Connect project was left on a&nbsp;shelf.</p><p>Eventually, even these lines drifted away, and my time was taken up by other efforts, and MITREid Connect became something I engaged less and less with. The handful of people that had worked on it even had plans to re-brand the project away from its MITRE roots, but even that small step never came to fruition.</p><p>Somewhere in that time, the world of computing and security shifted radically. MITREid Connect’s model of a heavyweight Java servlet no longer fit with the cloud-native hosted or even <a href="https://justinsecurity.medium.com/deployment-and-hosting-patterns-in-oauth-a1666dc0d966">semi-hosted services</a> that people are interested in using. Where once it was common for a large company to have its own data centers for computation power, it now seems crazy to not use a hosted cloud environment for your infrastructure. MITREid Connect was made for an on-premises perimeter-driven world, and that world has largely&nbsp;gone.</p> How It’s&nbsp;Going <p>MITREid Connect never really made the transition out of that world, and it shows in the code. It’s more than just its packaging as a Java servlet, it’s how sessions and data storage are handled, how scaling would function, and so on and so on. The dependencies stopped being updated, it was never repackaged — at least not by the core development crew — and it was never really brought up to speed with the rest of the&nbsp;world.</p><p>These days, MITREid Connect is not actively developed or maintained by any of the core developers, including myself. The main reason for this is simple: the people who were willing to pay for the work stopped asking for it and turned to other solutions. Most groups, including MITRE, have turned to cloud-hosted solutions to handle their entire identity stack. Or they’ve moved to other implementations, both open source and proprietary.</p><p>Even so, I wouldn’t call the project abandoned, exactly. It still exists and it still runs, and people still use it. But the core project’s dependencies haven’t been updated in quite some time and there’s nobody in the queue to manage that. The project <a href="https://github.com/mitreid-connect/OpenID-Connect-Java-Spring-Server/forks/">has been forked a number of times</a>, and some of those forks look like they’re still active, but I honestly don’t know which one I’d point someone&nbsp;to.</p><p>In conclusion, if you’ve found MITREid Connect and it works for you, that’s awesome, go to town! It’s immensely customizable and configurable, and the core is stable, solid, and thoroughly tested in more implementations than I know of. But if you’re looking for it to do something new, or to be deployed in your cloud container, I have to say you might want to look towards something else for a solution.</p>

<p>The following brief was used to form the discussion for the panel on May 2, 2023.</p><p>The ability to shift populations and gain (or force) adoption of new public policy positions is linked to the ability of the public sector form of governance.&nbsp; Over the past 20+ years the potential of truly digital economies and societies have been expounded endlessly but the results have been mixed with a consistent short fall in the meeting of expectations.&nbsp; High assurant digital identity appears to provide the final missing element to allow full digitalization of society to take place.&nbsp; </p><p>The public sector forms outlined here are generalizations for the purpose of framing a discussion around the design, implementation and adoption of digital wallets and the digital identifiers and credentials stored there-in, and to facilitate a discussion on how interactions would/could work when populations of the different forms interact in a global ecosystem.</p><p>In each of the forms, a private sector also operates and attempts to influence (to a greater or lesser degree) the setting public policy.&nbsp; Motivators of the private sector may be greatly different than that of public policy and as such creates a tension or a ‘force’ that may result in failure to realize expected gains from the policies.&nbsp; The private sector has also a desire to bring digital identity into practice, but its motivators are highly driven by rent extraction, not public policy or (necessarily) public good.&nbsp; Additionally, there are very powerful market forces for monopolization and control where those that ‘control’ the source of digital identification can gain very significant rents from society.</p> Central authority, strong decentralized authority with wary support of population <p>This form is characterized by the existence of a central authority that constitutionally or legally has constraints on its authority.&nbsp; The central authority typically must work with a network of strong decentralized bodies (state or provincial governments) who retain rights that are not granted to the central authority.&nbsp; The populations of this public sector form, can be said to be unruly at times and in recent history inclined to be suspicious of Public Sector forms.&nbsp; English speaking countries are good representative examples of this Form, though even within these there is a spectrum.</p> Centralized authority, strong decentralized authority with support of population <p>This form is characterized by the existence of a central authority that is constitutionally or legal has constraints on its authority.&nbsp; The central authority must work with a network of strong decentralized bodies (States) who retain rights that may conflict with the Central authority.&nbsp; The populations of this public sector form, while they may have a level of suspicion, concepts of identity cards and papers have long been used.&nbsp; The European Commission and the Member States of the European Union are a good representative example of this Form.</p> Strong centralized authority with support of population <p>This form is characterized with a strong central authority that has the ‘final’ say on direction and policy.&nbsp; This authority may delegate some responsibility to an elected body, but retains the right to overrule policy positions that may be put forward by this body.&nbsp; The population in this form is typically supportive of the form, and moves in accordance with the direction central authority.&nbsp; Examples of this form would be countries that retain a hereditary monarchy in regions such as, the Middle East, Asia and parts of Africa.</p> Authoritarian <p>This form is characterized with a central authority who’s right and power is absolute.&nbsp; This authority sets direction and policy based on its reasoning alone and is not subject to the demands of sharing power with subsidiary authorities.&nbsp; With this form, support (or lack of support) of the population is not considered.&nbsp; The authority has the coercive power and the willingness to use it to ensure its direction and policies are adhered to.</p><p>The desire to realize the benefits of digitalization through the adoption of forms of digital identity has been tried before today, and has seen at best marginal success and at worst total failure resulting in significant outlays of public expenditures (e.g., eIDAS v1, Gov.uk) and political embarrassment. </p><p>In this current cycle to realize the digital potential different ‘experiments’ are (or have been) tried.&nbsp; The Government of British Columbia in Canada started its journey with its Verifiable Organization Network, working with publicly available corporate documentation.&nbsp; In the European Union, under the eIDAS v2 regulation and European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI) efforts are underway with use cases in Education and Travel and Tourism.&nbsp; The Government of Bhutan will shortly be launching its digital wallet and identity effort having issued its first digital identifier credentials to the Crown Price of Bhutan in March.&nbsp; Finally, in the US, the Department of Homeland Security is in the fourth year of a five-year process on developing a digital Green Card and Right to Work documentation.&nbsp; </p><p>Each of these programs have necessarily focused within their own ‘borders’ of the public sector form to develop, learn, and prepare.&nbsp; However, the full realization of digital potential requires interoperability between all jurisdictions.&nbsp; </p><p>In this panel discussion, we have representation from three of the four generalized forms of the public sector.&nbsp; </p><p>In preparation for the discussion please reflect on the following questions:</p>  <p>In your respective public sector forms, how is public policy approaching the motivators of its citizenry and businesses to adopt and use digital wallets and identifiers?</p>  <p>It is human nature to only want to share successes, but in reality, the learning and discovery process requires failures and ‘bumps in the road.’&nbsp; What are the ‘redprints’<a title="">[1]</a> from your experiences and observations and what are the learnings gained from these?</p>  <p>To realize the full potential of digital wallets and identity requires that interoperability between legal jurisdictions of digital credentials.&nbsp; How is jurisdictional interoperability being addressed within your respective regions?&nbsp; What programs are in place (or being put in place) to ensure interoperability?</p>  <p>Join us for the discussion: https://www.meetup.com/digital-identity-from-vienna/events/292993136/</p><p><a title="">[1]</a> Redprints – the corollary of blueprints.&nbsp; Blueprints show you how to build something, redprints show you what didn’t work. </p>

<p>This article looks at a new concept for creating application security context models for modern solutions using best practice security. By using security context models in projects, a qualitative and secure authentication solution can be produced quicker and more efficient. At present, too many solution architects try to patch the security architecture after the application architecture has been completed.</p>



 Goal of the model 



<p>Modern application security solutions have evolved to utilize a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/zero-trust">zero trust</a> approach instead of relying on security perimeters. This shifts the focus to authentication and authorization flows rather than network or firewall protection. Security measures are now enforced locally on each component, rather than just at the front door. In order to implement this new paradigm and move away from the traditional boundary thinking, a modeling concept known as security context models can be used. These models provide a framework for understanding and addressing security concerns in modern applications, by placing authentication and authorization at the center of the security architecture model. </p>



 Benefits of a security context model 



<p>Security architecture part of the solution and not “fixed” after with weak workarounds.</p>



<p>Security reviews can use this and produce more output, less time is required re-modelling the solution.</p>



<p>Complex security flows or incorrect security concepts can be identified early.</p>



<p>Application security support simplified.</p>



<p>SAST: white box testing can use the model and focus.</p>



 What information is important in a security context diagram? 



<p>A security context model</p>



 
 displays interfaces with third party applications and security definitions 



 displays the authentication and authorization clients 



 displays the application and delegated client types (app identity or app+user identity) 



 displays private zones, public zones and security zones 



 displays the authentication and authorization flow types 



 has an appendix 
 



<p></p>



 Display interfaces with third party Apps and security definitions 



<p>The interfaces between the relevant internal and external components should be displayed in a context security model. By displaying the interfaces further security information can be included and displayed. Including the interfaces, the different security flows can be identified. Here’s an example displaying only the interfaces. From this model alone, it is clear that only Keycloak clients are used and the Keycloak identity provider federates to the further identity providers.</p>







<p></p>



 Displays the authentication and authorization clients 



<p>It is very useful to display the authentication and authorization flow type definitions. You should also specify if a client is a single tenant or a multiple tenant client. A security client should be either a delegated or an application type. In Azure, it is a good idea not to mix the application and delegated permissions in a single client which can lead to security problems.</p>







<p></p>



 Display application and delegated client types 



<p>The application or the delegated (user) types can be displayed in the model to add clarity to the API access. An access token returned to a UI client flow type is always a delegated (user + identity) access token. If the client credentials flow is used, then the access token is created for the trusted application and no user is involved. You could display the client inside the application and add an application access token to the model or I sometimes just display the flow type in the connection and it is clear that an application token is used to access the API.</p>







<p></p>



 Displays private zones, public zones and security zones 



<p>The public or private zones should be displayed in a security context model. Firewalls can also be included to enrich the model but these are not required. Any component which implements part of the authentication or authorization should be included. If it makes it easier to understand the security architecture, it should be included. By including the security zones, you can see clearly which components are accessible from the internet or intranet or separate networks. This does not change the security requirements of each component as each component needs to implement the security anyway (Zero trust strategy).</p>







<p></p>



 Displays the authentication and authorization flow types 



<p>It is important to include the authentication and the authorization flow types to acquire access tokens, or access to UI applications. Only standards should be used and a client application should never create it’s own access tokens. In the following model, the client credentials flow is used to request an application access token to access the API application.</p>







<p></p>



 Should I include network security components? 



<p>Traditional security boundary models were created with the firewall rules and definitions to control the traffic. These models are still required but have a different focus. In an application security context model, only the network components used to implement authentication or authorization components are included. If you use an API manager to implement an OAuth2 client for the API application, then this needs to be included. If you use an application proxy to remove or add HTTP security headers, this should be included as well.</p>



 Example Security Context for Web application using BFF (Backend for Frontend) 



<p>A Blazor application is implemented using BFF security architecture. The Blazor application uses a downstream API which authorizes using delegated user access tokens. The API application uses an Azure SQL. The API and the database are not public to the internet.</p>







<p></p>



 Security context model appendix 



<p>Interface 1 Blazor –&nbsp; Key Vault </p>



<p>Access using service managed identity with restricted access</p>



<p>Interface 2 API –&nbsp; Key Vault </p>



<p>Access using service managed identity with restricted access</p>



<p>Interface 3 Blazor – API</p>



<p>OAuth using delegated user access token and scope. The API is restricted for use with the Blazor UI using the Azure App registration clientId</p>



<p>Interface 4 API –&nbsp; SQL DB </p>



<p>Access using service managed identity with restricted access</p>



<p>Interface 5 Blazor  –&nbsp; Azure AD</p>



<p>OpenID Connect code flow with PKCE, confidential client</p>

Almost 300 people from around the world called 160 sessions. The energy was high and I enjoyed seeing so many people working on identity talking with each other and sharing their ideas. The topics were diverse but I think it's fair to say that verifiable credentials were a hot topic. And while there were plenty of discussions about technical implementations, I think those were overshadowed by sessions discussing credential business models, use cases, and adoption. We should have the book of proceedings completed in about a month and you'll be able to get the details of sessions there. You can view <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/past-workshops/">past Book of Proceedings here</a>.</p><p>As I said, there were attendees from all over the world as you can see by the pins in the map at the top of this post. Not surprisingly, most of the attendees were from the US (219), followed by Canada (20). Germany, the UK, and Switzerland rounded out the top five with 8, 7, and 6 attendees respectively. The next five, Australia (5), South Korea (3), Japan (3), Indonesia (3), and Columbia (3) showed the diversity with attendees from APAC and South America. Sadly, there were no attendees from Africa this time. Please remember we offer scholarships for people from underrepresented areas, so if you'd like to come to IIW37, please let us know.</p><p>In terms of states and provinces, California was, unsurprisingly, first with 101. New York (17), Washington (16), Utah (15), and British Columbia (11) rounded out the top five. Victoria was the source of BC's strong Canadian showing coming in fifth in cities with 8 attendees after San Jose (15), San Francisco( 13), Seattle (12), and New York (10).</p><p>The week was fabulous. I can't begin to recount the many important, interesting, and timely conversations I had. I heard from many others that they had a similar experience. IIW37 will be held Oct 10-12, 2023 at the Computer History Museum. We'll have tickets available soon. I hope you'll be able to join us.</p>   <p>Thanks for reading Phil Windley's Technometria!

<p>With this years <a href="https://identiverse.com/">Identiverse</a> just over a month away (and the deadline to get the draft of <a href="https://identiverse.com/idv23/session/1361547/">my talk this year</a> swiftly approaching), I was reminded that I never got around to sharing video of the keynote I gave at last years conference. It was very kind and a tremendous vote of confidence in me from Andi Hindle to offer me the opportunity to take the keynote stage during an important transition year for the Identiverse conference. I took this chance to bring together a number of thoughts that had been rattling around in my brain based on the work I’ve been doing at Uniken in creating customer identity and security systems for deployment around the world, catering to a variety of verticals, consumer demographics, capabilities, and threat vectors. It coalesced nicely (I believe) into a talk about designing trustworthy systems.</p>



 

 Identiverse 2022 Keynote: The Design of Trustworthy Things



<p>Why did I feel compelled to focus on the topic of trust (and no, it’s not the ‘Zero Trust’ type of trust I’m talking about here)? It’s because there is very clearly a trust crisis permeating every aspect of our lives.&nbsp; In the world of identity, we saw it recently in the scams and frauds that permeated the NFT world, and in the swift backlash against the IRS’ plans to add face biometrics to its identity proofing flows. We see this crisis of trust all around us—and it has a significant impact on the world that we as identity professionals are responsible for.&nbsp;Trust is something that you earn, something that is given to you. We can’t build trust itself into a digital identity system. But we can, and we must, build systems which are worthy of trust.</p>



<p>In my talk, I attempted to tease out what it means to build trustworthy&nbsp;systems – demonstrating the meaningful ways in which digital identity technologies are woven into the fabric and architecture of such systems, and showing how such trustworthy systems may finally deliver on the promise of financial, social and technological inclusion, dignity and reliability. The feedback was <a href="https://blog.talkingidentity.com/downloads/response-to-the-design-of-trustworthy-things">overwhelmingly positive</a>, for which I am tremendously grateful, and I hope you find it useful as well.</p>



<p>Here are links to a number of the resources I shared or referred to in my talk:</p>



 
 Don Norman’s <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-design-of-everyday-things-don-norman/12398830?ean=9780465050659">brilliant book</a> on ‘The Design of Everyday Things’, which I highly recommend for all identity practitioners. 



 A <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/defined/human-centered-design">quick primer</a> on Human Centered Design. 



 Important work by Dr. Jessica Barker on <a href="https://www.cygenta.co.uk/post/phishing-simulations-backfire">how phishing simulations backfire</a> and erode trust. 



 The hugely important research and work by ‘Women in Identity’ being done to <a href="https://www.womeninidentity.org/cpages/code-of-conduct">develop a global identity code of conduct</a>, that I strongly urge every identity practitioner to follow and possibly get involved with.

<p>先程Google Bardのベータアクセス権を取得しました。</p>



<p>ご存知のように、ChatGPTのプライバシー特性については、イタリアのプライバシー保護機関 「Garante 」の<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/04/5220/">調査</a>に象徴されるように、かなり多くの疑問があります。その一つが、生身の人間に関する情報の扱い、特に誤まった情報を創作して回答してしまう問題です。これは、GDPRをはじめとする世界のプライバシー規制に基づく適法性に疑問が投げかけられています。</p>



<p>そこで、ChatGPTとGoogle Bardでそのテストに臨みました。</p>



 

 



<p>テストするために、私は2人の生きている個人の情報を尋ねました：1人は比較的無名ですが、まだ検索可能で文書がインターネット上で入手可能であり、1人は著名な人物です。つまり、私とイーロン・マスクです。</p>



<p>これがChatGPTからの返答です。</p>



(出所) ChatGPT &lt;2023-04-18取得&gt;.



<p>がっつり回答してしまっていますね。。そしてそれは、実は私に関する不正確な情報でいっぱいです<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/04/5287/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-5287" title="このような不正確な情報を流したくないので、アクセシビリティの観点からは望ましくないのですが、テキストではなく画像で表示することにしました。">1</a>。このような「偽」の情報を返信することは、重大なプライバシー侵害となる可能性があり、重く受け止める必要があります。</p>



<p>これに対して、Google Bardはこのように返信しています：</p>



(出所) Google Bard &lt;2023-04-18取得&gt;.



<p>人々にとってはあまり面白くないかもしれませんが、おそらくこれが本来のあるべき姿なのでしょう生きている人のために答えを作って返してははいけないのです。</p>



<p>実は、18日、その時はBardがどういう回答をするか知らなかったのですが、前職がドイツのある州の個人情報保護当局の人で、現在プライバシー関連の弁護士事務所を開業している人とランチしながらこの件を話していて、今回のBardのような、個人に関する情報出力はフィルタリングしてしまって返さないという対応しかありえないだろうという話をしたばかりでした<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/04/5287/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-5287" title="なお、個人に関する情報以外はGoogle Bard も ChatGPTよろしく創作して返してくれます :-D">2</a>。そういう意味でも大変興味深い事例です。逆に、ChatGPTは個人情報の開示請求をされたらどうするつもりなんでしょうね。持っていませんと答えても、持っていると答えても茨の道しか無いような気がするんですが。</p>



<p>このラウンドは、Google Bardの明確な勝ちですね。今後の動向が注目されます。</p>

<p>This article shows how to provision Azure IoT hub devices using Azure IoT hub device provisioning services (DPS) and ASP.NET Core. The devices are setup using chained certificates created using .NET Core and managed in the web application. The data is persisted in a database using EF Core and the certificates are generated using the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/CertificateManager">CertificateManager</a> Nuget package. </p>

 Setup 



<p>To setup a new Azure IoT Hub DPS, enrollment group and devices, the web application creates a new certificate using an ECDsa private key and the .NET Core APIs. The data is stored in two pem files, one for the public certificate and one for the private key. The pem public certificate file is downloaded from the web application and uploaded to the certificates blade in Azure IoT Hub DPS. The web application persists the data to a database using EF Core and SQL. A new certificate is created from the DPS root certificate and used to create a DPS enrollment group. The certificates are chained from the original DPS certificate. New devices are registered and created using the enrollment group. Another new device certificate chained from the enrollment group certificate is created per device and used in the DPS. The Azure IoT Hub DPS creates a new IoT Hub device using the linked IoT Hubs. Once the IoT hub is running, the private key from the device certificate is used to authenticate the device and send data to the server. </p>







<p></p>



<p>When the ASP.NET Core web application is started, users can create new certificates, enrollment groups and add devices to the groups. I plan to extend the web application to add devices, delete devices, and delete groups. I plan to add authorization for the different user types and better paging for the different UIs.  At present all certificates use ECDsa private keys but this can easily be changed to other types. This depends on the type of root certificate used. </p>



<p></p>







<p></p>



<p>The application is secured using Microsoft.Identity.Web and requires an authenticated user. This can be setup in the program file or in the startup extensions. I use EnableTokenAcquisitionToCallDownstreamApi to force the OpenID Connect code flow. The configuration is read from the default AzureAd app.settings and the whole application is required to be authenticated. When the enable and disable flows are added, I will add different users with different authorization levels.</p>


  builder.Services.AddDistributedMemoryCache();

builder.Services.AddAuthentication(
	OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
	.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApp(
		builder.Configuration.GetSection("AzureAd"))
	.EnableTokenAcquisitionToCallDownstreamApi()
	.AddDistributedTokenCaches();
  


<p></p>



 Create an Azure IoT Hub DPS certificate 



<p>The web application is used to create devices using certificates and DPS enrollment groups. The DpsCertificateProvider class is used to create the root self signed certificate for the DPS enrollment groups. The NewRootCertificate from the CertificateManager Nuget package is used to create the certificate using an ECDsa private key. This package wraps the default .NET APIs for creating certificates and adds a layer of abstraction. You could just use the lower level APIs directly. The certificate is exported to two separate pem files and persisted to the database.</p>


  public class DpsCertificateProvider
{
    private readonly CreateCertificatesClientServerAuth _createCertsService;
    private readonly ImportExportCertificate _iec;
    private readonly DpsDbContext _dpsDbContext;

    public DpsCertificateProvider(CreateCertificatesClientServerAuth ccs,
        ImportExportCertificate importExportCertificate,
        DpsDbContext dpsDbContext)
    {
        _createCertsService = ccs;
        _iec = importExportCertificate;
        _dpsDbContext = dpsDbContext;
    }

    public async Task&lt;(string PublicPem, int Id)&gt; CreateCertificateForDpsAsync(string certName)
    {
        var certificateDps = _createCertsService.NewRootCertificate(
            new DistinguishedName { CommonName = certName, Country = "CH" },
            new ValidityPeriod { ValidFrom = DateTime.UtcNow, ValidTo = DateTime.UtcNow.AddYears(50) },
            3, certName);

        var publicKeyPem = _iec.PemExportPublicKeyCertificate(certificateDps);

        string pemPrivateKey = string.Empty;
        using (ECDsa? ecdsa = certificateDps.GetECDsaPrivateKey())
        {
            pemPrivateKey = ecdsa!.ExportECPrivateKeyPem();
            FileProvider.WriteToDisk($"{certName}-private.pem", pemPrivateKey);
        }
 
        var item = new DpsCertificate
        {
            Name = certName,
            PemPrivateKey = pemPrivateKey,
            PemPublicKey = publicKeyPem
        };

        _dpsDbContext.DpsCertificates.Add(item);

        await _dpsDbContext.SaveChangesAsync();

        return (publicKeyPem, item.Id);
    }

    public async Task&lt;List&lt;DpsCertificate&gt;&gt; GetDpsCertificatesAsync()
    {
        return await _dpsDbContext.DpsCertificates.ToListAsync();
    }

    public async Task&lt;DpsCertificate?&gt; GetDpsCertificateAsync(int id)
    {
        return await _dpsDbContext.DpsCertificates.FirstOrDefaultAsync(item =&gt; item.Id == id);
    }
}
  


<p>Once the root certificate is created, you can download the public pem file from the web application and upload it to the Azure IoT Hub DPS portal. This needs to be verified. You could also use a CA created certificate for this, if it is possible to create child chained certificates. The enrollment groups are created from this root certificate.</p>







<p></p>



 Create an Azure IoT Hub DPS enrollment group 



<p>Devices can be created in different ways in the Azure IoT Hub. We use a DPS enrollment group with certificates to create the Azure IoT devices. The DpsEnrollmentGroupProvider is used to create the enrollment group certificate. This uses the root certificate created in the previous step and chains the new group certificate from this. The enrollment group is used to add devices. Default values are defined for the enrollment group and the pem files are saved to the database. The root certificate is read from the database and the chained enrollment group certificate uses an ECDsa private key like the root self signed certificate.</p>



<p>The CreateEnrollmentGroup method is used to set the initial values of the IoT Hub Device. The ProvisioningStatus is set to enabled. This means when the device is registered, it will be enabled to send messages. You could also set this to disabled and enable it after when the device gets used by an end client for the first time. A MAC or a serial code from the device hardware could be used to enable the IoT Hub device. By waiting till the device is started by the end client, you could choose a IoT Hub optimized for this client.</p>

 Register a device in the enrollment group 



<p>The DpsRegisterDeviceProvider class creates a new device chained certificate using the enrollment group certificate and creates this using the ProvisioningDeviceClient. The transport ProvisioningTransportHandlerAmqp is set in this example. There are different transport types possible and you need to chose the one which best meets your needs. The device certificate uses an ECDsa private key and stores everything to the database. The PFX for windows is stored directly to the file system. I use pem files and create the certificate from these in the device client sending data to the hub and this is platform independent. The create PFX file requires a password to use it.</p>

 Download certificates and use 



<p>The private and the public pem files are used to setup the Azure IoT Hub device and send data from the device to the server. A HTML form is used to download the files. The form sends a post request to the file download API.</p>


  &lt;form action="/api/FileDownload/DpsDevicePublicKeyPem" method="post"&gt;
	&lt;input type="hidden" value="@Model.DpsDevice.Id" id="Id" name="Id" /&gt;
	&lt;button type="submit" style="padding-left:0" class="btn btn-link"&gt;Download Public PEM&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
  


<p>The DpsDevicePublicKeyPemAsync method implements the file download. The method gets the data from the database and returns this as pem file.</p>


  [HttpPost("DpsDevicePublicKeyPem")]
public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; DpsDevicePublicKeyPemAsync([FromForm] int id)
{
	var cert = await _dpsRegisterDeviceProvider
		.GetDpsDeviceAsync(id);
	if (cert == null) throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(cert));
	if (cert.PemPublicKey == null) 
		throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(cert.PemPublicKey));

	return File(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(cert.PemPublicKey),
		"application/octet-stream",
		$"{cert.Name}-public.pem");
}
  


<p>The device UI displays the data and allows the authenticated user to download the files.</p>







<p></p>



<p>The CertificateManager and the Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Client Nuget packages are used to implement the IoT Hub device client. The pem files with the public certificate and the private key can be loaded into a X509Certificate instance. This is then used to send the data using the DeviceAuthenticationWithX509Certificate class. The SendEvent method sends the data using the IoT Hub device Message class.</p>


  var serviceProvider = new ServiceCollection()
	.AddCertificateManager()
	.BuildServiceProvider();
var iec = serviceProvider.GetService&lt;ImportExportCertificate&gt;();

#region pem

var deviceNamePem = "robot1-feed";

var certPem = File.ReadAllText($"{_pathToCerts}{deviceNamePem}-public.pem");
var eccPem = File.ReadAllText($"{_pathToCerts}{deviceNamePem}-private.pem");
var cert = X509Certificate2.CreateFromPem(certPem, eccPem);

// setup deviceCert windows store export 
var pemDeviceCertPrivate = iec!.PemExportPfxFullCertificate(cert);
var certDevice = iec.PemImportCertificate(pemDeviceCertPrivate);

#endregion pem

var auth = new DeviceAuthenticationWithX509Certificate(deviceNamePem, certDevice);
var deviceClient = DeviceClient.Create(iotHubUrl, auth, transportType);

if (deviceClient == null)
{
	Console.WriteLine("Failed to create DeviceClient!");
}
else
{
	Console.WriteLine("Successfully created DeviceClient!");
	SendEvent(deviceClient).Wait();
}
  


 Notes 



<p>Using certificates in .NET and windows is complicated due to how the private keys are handled and loaded. The private keys need to be exported or imported into the stores etc. This is not an easy API to get working and the docs for this are confusing. </p>



<p>This type of device transport and the default setup for the device would need to be adapted for your system. In this example, I used ECDsa certificates but you could also use RSA based keys. The root certificate could be replaced with a CA issued one. I created long living certificates because I do not want the devices to stop working in the field. This should be moved to a configuration. A certificate rotation flow would make sense as well.</p>



<p>In the follow up articles, I plan to save the events in hot and cold path events and implement device enable, disable flows. I also plan to write about the device twins. The device twins is a excellent way of sharing data in both directions. </p>

 If you owned Twitter, how would you grow it? I think you have basically two choices: 

 
 
 You can try to grow the number of users who use Twitter on a regular basis. 
 
 
 You can try to increase the number of times each user tweets and browses others’ tweets. 
 
 
 Is that the same for the Fediverse? 
 Turns out the answer is a resounding No! We have far more options. 

 
 
 Yep, we can try an

<p>If you owned Twitter, how would you grow it? I think you have basically two choices:</p>

 
 
<p>You can try to grow the number of users who use Twitter on a regular basis.</p>
 
 
<p>You can try to increase the number of times each user tweets and browses others’ tweets.</p>
 
 
<p>Is that the same for the Fediverse?</p>
<p>Turns out the answer is a resounding No! We have far more options.</p>

 
 
<p>Yep, we can try and grow the number of users who regularly use the Fediverse.</p>
 
 
<p>Yep, we can try to increase the number of times each user posts and reads other people’s
posts. (Except that we don’t actually want to do that so very much, otherwise the
Fediverse would have to become addictive, and not wanting to be manipulated is one of
the things that got us off the big centralized social platforms in the first place.)</p>
 
 
<p>We can do more things than just “tweeting” in the Fediverse.
Because unlike on Twitter, every Fediverse-enabled app can – and usually does – add
new features that go way beyond just posting “What’s happening”. And there are so many
of them already! PeerTube for video, PixelFed for photos, FunkWhale for audio,
Mobilizon for events, OwnCast for streaming, Bookwyrm for reading, Micro.blog for blogging
and more … and all interoperating on the same network. Each new feature like that
grows the Fediverse, as I can now do more things, and will if it is easy enough. Each
of those tools grows the use of the Fediverse with the same number of users and the
same number of “tweets”. Practically, Twitter does not have this option.</p>
 
 
<p>Which, together, enables entirely new categories of use cases that go way beyond of
what a social media platform like Twitter has ever done (or dreamt of!), or what any
one Fediverse app can do on its own. Many of those will turn out to be much more
valuable and useful than mere sharing “What’s happening”. And they will be possible
because all of those apps can be combined in various ways on the same, free, ad-free,
manipulation-free, open, rich communications network called the Fediverse.</p>
 
 
<p>For this to work, however, we need to work to make the interactions between the various
Fediverse apps much smoother than they are today. Yes, of course, ActivityPub lets us
send notes and likes and comments and various other things around from one app to another.</p>
<p>But much more can and should be done, such as:</p>
 
 
<p>Seamless single-sign-on across the Fediverse apps that I’m using. So if I see a
Mobilizon event shared on Mastodon, I want to be able to click “Yes, RSVP, I’m coming”
and identify myself with my Mastodon-issued Fediverse handle. There is no reason why
I should have to sign up for a separate Mobilizon account first.</p>
<p>The same, of course, should be true about videos, music, bookmarks, and so many other
things in so many Fediverse apps. (Before you get concerned, yes, you should
be able to have multiple non-connected “personas”, like work and play, in the Fediverse,
but we still need single-sign-on within the scope of a single persona.)</p>
 
 
<p>My social network should come with me when I use different Fediverse apps. So if I
decide to start using Pixelfed, I should be able to instantly follow all the photo
streams of all the friends I’m following somewhere else, such as on Pleroma or
Mastodon. After all, if I’m interested in the photos that my friend Joe shares, why
would I make a distinction whether he shares them through one app or the other?
The Fediverse can do this if we want to; no other social network can do this.</p>
 
 
<p>And and and…</p>
 
 
<p>Imagine when data flows freely, data of many, rich kinds, across an open network, directly
from your friends to you. Not just some social media data, but most data you care about!
With nobody in the middle to manipulate you, or charge you, or advertise to you, or censor
you … and no unnatural hoops that you need to jump through.</p>
<p>We got to work on that last bit, and on that note, I’m very happy that a
<a href="https://fedidevs.org/">Fediverse Developer Network</a> is coming together with participation
from many excellent Fediverse developers working on a variety of apps. Our goal here is
to connect the people well who work on this, so their apps can connect well, too! It’s
early days, but very promising.</p>

 Fighting for Consensus at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) 



  
<blockquote><p>5.5. Chair Decision and Group Decision Appeals</p><p>When group participants believe that their concerns are not being duly considered by the group or the Chair, they may ask the Director (for representatives of a Member organization, via their Advisory Committee representative) to confirm or deny the decision. This is a Group Decision Appeal or a Chair Decision Appeal. The participants should also make their requests known to the Team Contact. The Team Contact must inform the Director when a group participant has raised concerns about due process.</p><p>Any requests to the Director to confirm a decision must include a summary of the issue (whether technical or procedural), decision, and rationale for the objection.

<p>From “W3C Process Document” <a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/Process-20211102/">https://www.w3.org/2021/Process-20211102/</a></p>



<p>It’s unfortunate that I find myself formally appealing a decision by the W3C Decentralized Identifier Working Group (DID WG) chairs. Simply put, the decision was not made according to the applicable W3C Process, which requires seeking consensus through selecting proposals with the weakest technical objections.</p>



<p>The decision to appeal was not made lightly. It will force into the public view a disagreement between parties who generally have high mutual regard and respect. I personally think the DID WG chairs are well-intentioned and doing their best to resolve the challenges of the underlying work. However, in this particular case, we have a failure to secure consensus and an unfortunate autocratic imposition of the chairs’ position on a group in significant dissent.</p>



<p>I got involved in this particular stream of work after attending the first ID2020 and Rebooting the Web of Trust II after over ten years in the user-centric identity movement as championed by the Internet Identity Workshop and ProjectVRM. I became (and remain) an editor for <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-use-cases/">Verifiable Credentials Use Cases</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-use-cases/">Use Cases and Requirements for Decentralized Identifiers</a> and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-rubric">DID Method Rubric</a>, all W3C publications. I am treasurer and board member of <a href="https://weboftrust.info">Rebooting the Web of Trust</a>, a collaborative writing workshop that incubated early Decentralized Identity technologies like DIDs and VCs. My business is a small consulting company that helps clients better understand the human requirements for decentralized identity systems and applications. I also created the DID Directory <a href="https://diddirectory.com">DID Directory</a> and host a podcast about DID methods, <a href="https://rubric.cc">The Rubric</a>. In short, I have over 15 years invested in bringing this technology to realization, as a consistent contributor to the shared work of the broader community and as a leader in both W3C and external efforts.</p>



<p>After years of serving as invited expert to the VCWG and DIDWG, we joined the W3C this year to specifically to oppose the Chairs’ decision in this matter.</p>



 Technical Background 



<p>While this appeal does not rely on a technical argument for overturning the chairs decision, our primary technical reasoning is straightforward.</p>



<p>Enabling the DID WG to develop specific DID methods will actively undermine the work’s fundamental goal of decentralization.</p>



 A New Architecture Building on the Old Architecture 



<p>We have an opportunity in decentralized identifiers to reinvent outdated architectures that rely on, and extend, the innate authority of centralized actors. The World Wide Web is an amazing achievement in operational decentralization. Unfortunately its naming system is fundamentally based on centralized authority, and therefore subject to manipulation and abuse in ways that decentralized systems are designed to avoid. DIDs represent an opportunity for identifiers to be first class citizens for the World Wide Web, without needing to defer to any centralized authority. Not IANA. Not DNS. DIDs provide a way for anyone to stand up an identification system and for anyone to use that system. It is, in its way, a profound restructuring of what identity means in digital systems. Combined with Verifiable Credentials, this emerging identity system provides a decentralized way for individuals to engage digitally with promise of greater privacy, improved user control, and increased respect for our humanity.</p>



<p>A fundamental innovation of DIDs relative to public key cryptography is the level of indirection between the identifier and the cryptography, with different DID methods providing different means for managing this level of indirection.</p>



<p>DIDs resolve to DID Documents, where resolution is defined by the DID method specified in the DID itself. The data required to determine the current authoritative DID document for a given DID is stored in the Verifiable Data Registry of that method.</p>



<p>Consider the DID did:example:abc. This is a well-formed DID using the “example” method. The mechanism to turn that DID into a DID document based on that DID method’s Verifiable Data Registry is called resolution.</p>



 <a href="https://blog.joeandrieu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/did-architecture.png"></a>Figure 1. DID Architecture 



<p>First, client software sends the DID to a resolver expected to handle that particular method (“example”). The resolver then uses operations defined by the “example” method to retrieve salient data from the Verifiable Data Registry. Finally, the resolver produces a well-formed DID document and returns that to the client. The client can then interpret the DID document to use the current cryptographic and service endpoint information for that DID.</p>



<p>Because of this level of indirection between the DID and the DID document, DID controllers can update the DID’s cryptographic material without changing the identifier itself (and without relying on a trusted third party). This means that normal, operational security actions like key rotation and revocation can be implemented without requiring direct communication with relying parties. The VDR acts as the intermediary. In fact, the DID controller does not even need to know who is relying on the DID; there is no requirement for direct communication about updates to the DID document. In contrast, updating private key information with traditional public/private key cryptography requires communicating the new public key to all dependent parties.</p>



<p>By design, DIDs enable any form of Verifiable Data Registry. As long as a method can specify how you perform the Create, Read, Update, and Deactivate operations for a DID using that VDR, it’s a valid method. This has allowed DID methods based on bitcoin (did:btcr and did:ion), ethereum (did:ethr and did:elem), bespoke blockchains (did:v1 and did:cosmos), Amazon’s QLDB, and even public keys actually stored in the DID itself (did:key and did:jwk). This fundamental goal of allowing any type of VDR means that interoperability stops at the resolver, which itself provides the integration between resolver clients and a method’s VDR, allowing any method to define its own mechanism for transforming a DID into its DID document, using any kind of VDR.</p>



 Parallels to HTML and HTTP 



<p>The architecture of DID methods is a lot like the architecture of the web itself, where browsers dereference URLs to access webservers that interact with a backend to provide a resource back to the browser. By design, the browser doesn’t need to know how the web server and back end communicate, nor how the data is stored in the backend. All the browser needs to know is the interface HTTP and HTML.</p>



 <a href="https://blog.joeandrieu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/web-architecture.png"></a>Figure 2. Web Architecture 



<p>The equivalent is true for DIDs. With a standard for DID resolution, any DID client would have a standard mechanism (resolution) that can be provided by any conformant DID method, allowing the retrieval and use of DID documents without intimate knowledge of how the VDR works.</p>



<p>That’s the route to interoperability for DIDs, just as it was and is for the web.</p>



 Progress to date 



<p>We built the first two components of the DID system in the DID Core 1.0 specification, namely, a URL syntax for DIDs and a data model for DID documents, which provide the cryptographic material for verifiable interactions related to that DID. In effect, this is like defining URLs (RFC3986) and HTML (originally RFC1866). At the time of the groups initial chartering, we intentionally left DID resolution out of scope, instead merely defining a contract for what DID resolution should provide (without specifying how it is to be provided). Resolution is how one takes a given DID and retrieves the associated DID document. Resolution is the http of DIDs. It takes a well-formed URL (the DID) and specifies how you process bits sent &amp; received over the wire to get the resource indicated (the DID document in this case).</p>



<p>This is the next step in the work: defining an interoperable mechanism for resolving DIDs for different DID methods. Under the hood, resolution is necessarily method-specific because each method is free to use any verifiable data registry (VDR), and, inevitably, different registries have different mechanisms for creating, reading, updating, and deactivating DIDs. While it will be impossible to have a common specification for all potential VDRs (unless you force all methods to use the same VDR mechanism), it is possible to define an interface that all methods could provide, in order to allow client software to resolve a DID and ignore the method-specific details. This is how we get interoperability between DID methods.</p>



<p>This is a stark contrast to the idea that the next step in the work is standardizing specific DID methods. Some have argued that developing a specific DID method would somehow improve interoperability. However, we believe the only interoperability benefit we get from standardizing a specified DID method is either (1) for different implementations of that single method or (2) imposing the mechanisms of that DID method on other methods. Focusing on a single method does not, and cannot, improve interoperability between Methods, especially those based on fundamentally different VDRs. &nbsp;As a decentralized technology, imposing the mechanisms of any given method on other methods is antithetical to the point of the work. In a truly decentralized system, anyone can define a new DID method and it should “just work”. That means interoperability between DID methods is the fundamental priority. We achieve that by specifically focusing on a shared, standardized mechanism for DID resolution rather than focusing on specific methods.</p>



 Summary of Technical Objection 



<p>Having the DID WG standardize specific DID methods creates moral hazards that will inevitably reduce the decentralization of DIDs themselves. Whichever methods the group chooses will attain unprecedented acceleration and impact. It will take an increased attention from the WG focused on those methods, taking away from attention that could go to advance all DID methods. That attention will also increase the WGs familiarity with how chosen methods solve certain problems and those approaches will necessarily already have the blessing of the WG, making them preferred favorites over approaches used by other methods. In short, giving the DID WG the permission to focus its attention on selected favorites would directly undermine its ability to advance the work with equal respect for all methods.</p>



 Procedural Objection 



<p>We also object on procedural grounds to the inclusion of standards-track documents for unstated new specifications in a so-called “maintenance charter”. A working group chartered for maintenance should not be creating new standards-track documents for arbitrary, unspecified DID methods. Maintenance groups should be focused on maintenance, not creating new specifications, especially unnamed specifications. Like the technical argument for decentralization, we do not rely on this procedural flaw in this appeal.</p>



 Formal Request to Deny Chair Decision 



<p>I am formally appealing to the Director of the W3C to deny the decision by the DID WG Charter chairs to override dissent about the inclusion of DID methods in the scope of the next DID WG Charter, as embodied in part in the decision to merge PR#20 and PR#27 into the DID WG Charter.</p>



<p>The decision is best summarized in the comment merging in PR#27</p>



<blockquote><p>The DID WG chairs have met. We have concluded that merging PR #27 will produce a charter that best represents the consensus of the DID Working Group participants over the past year.</p><p>Despite many, many discussions, no other proposal within the group has garnered as much support as this one has for the creation of a new DID Working Group, which will focus on maintaining Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0 and publishing errata updates to that specification. The charter also permits the next DID WG to begin work on DID Methods and DID Resolution, but does not require it, e.g., the group that forms may do as much or as little work on these optional topics as desired.</p><p>Now, regarding the other open PRs, #29 and #30:</p><p>The predominant concern raised has been with the inclusion of DID Methods as optional work in this charter. The inclusion of DID Methods in the next chartered DID WG was part of the W3C Director’s decision to overturn the Formal Objections raised against the publication of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0. The chairs feel that that decision represents the consensus of the W3C and as such the inclusion of DID Methods as optional work in this charter is absolutely necessary. So we have concluded that PR Remove mention of DID Methods from the charter #29 is no longer relevant to this discussion. We are leaving it open for comments, but they will not change the decision at this point.</p><p>There have been suggestions for an alternative group focused exclusively on DID Resolution. We support the effort to create a DID Resolution Working Group that focuses entirely on DID Resolution, as that will strongly support the work of the DID Working Group, which must focus on the DID Specification. We encourage the proponents to develop their proposal and present it to W3M and the AC Forum as a new Working Group. However, because it would not be a DID Working Group, we have concluded that PR Proposal: Charter for the DID Resolution WG (as a replacement to current proposal) to continue the work of DID 1.0 #30 is no longer relevant to this conversation. We are leaving it open for those who wish to continue designing a separate DID Resolution-focused WG, but we do not expect such work to change the decision at this point.</p>2023/03/15 <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/27#issuecomment-1470920464">https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/27#issuecomment-1470920464</a></blockquote>



<p>I am appealing on five points, all of which highlight the chairs’ failure to with respect to W3C Process.</p>



  
  The PRs lacked consensus  Consensus was not legitimately sought  Claims of “W3C Consensus” are erroneous, out of scope, and irrelevant  This sets a untenable precedent  Proposals with the weakest objection should be favored  



<p></p>
  



<p>I discuss each of these below.</p>



 The PR lacks consensus 



<p>Both staff and chairs have acknowledged that adding DID methods to the spec lacks consensus.</p>



<blockquote><p>@brentzundel: I am merging this PR over their objections because having the flexibility to go this route could be vital should our efforts to move DID Resolution forward be frustrated. </p>2022/09/21 <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/20#issuecomment-1253912348">https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/20#issuecomment-1253912348</a></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>@pchampin: We clearly didn’t manage to reach consensus here </p>2023/01/11 <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/27#issuecomment-1379253408">https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/27#issuecomment-1379253408</a></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>@brentzundel: There is no consensus at this stage, nor do I believe it is possible to achieve it. </p>2023/01/23 <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/27#issuecomment-1401199754">https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/27#issuecomment-1401199754</a></blockquote>



<p>The lack of consensus does not appear to be in question.</p>



 Consensus was not legitimately sought 



<p>The W3C 2021 Process document places consensus at the core of the W3C:</p>



<blockquote><p>Consensus is a core value of W3C. To promote consensus, the W3C process requires Chairs to ensure that groups consider all legitimate views and objections, and endeavor to resolve them, whether these views and objections are expressed by the active participants of the group or by others (e.g., another W3C group, a group in another organization, or the general public).</p></blockquote>



<p>In the section on managing dissent:</p>



<blockquote><p>Groups should favor proposals that create the weakest objections. This is preferred over proposals that are supported by a large majority but that cause strong objections from a few people.</p></blockquote>



<p>And, in the section on deciding by vote:</p>



<blockquote><p>A group should only conduct a vote to resolve a substantive issue after the Chair has determined that all available means of reaching consensus through technical discussion and compromise have failed, and that a vote is necessary to break a deadlock.</p></blockquote>



<p>Unfortunately, the chairs did not fulfill these obligations to use all available means of reaching consensus through technical discussion.</p>



<p>They avoided the issue. They denied the issue.  Ultimately, they did not lead a technical discussion in an effort to find proposals that create the weakest objections.</p>



  Avoidance  Denial  Deference to political priorities over technical discussion  



 Avoidance 



<p>Despite consistent efforts by myself and others who share my concerns, the chairs actions have had the effect of avoiding dissent rather than working with the group to find the proposal with the weakest objections. They ignored Github issues, held no conference calls, created a false impression of engagement, and failed to respond to direct outreach.</p>



 Ignoring Github issues 



<p>After the initial discussion at TPAC, @brentzundel merged PR#20 on Sep 21, 2022, which put DID methods in scope, with the note that this was against objections voiced at TPAC. I commented in opposition to that merge on October 25, 2022, requesting the PR be reverted. To this date, neither chairs nor staff have even bothered to respond.</p>



 No group phone calls nor email discussion after TPAC 



<p>After the initial objections were acknowledged at TPAC there were neither group conference calls nor any outreach to the mailing list on this matter. Instead of facilitating a conversation to reach a consensus, the chairs acted as if there were no significant issues for the group to discuss.</p>



 False engagement and misdirection 



<p>After lengthy discussion on the PR#27 in question (largely by others) @brentzundel created another PR #29 with the stated goal of finding the proposal with the “best consensus” introduced in his comment on #27 on </p>



  
<blockquote><p>@brentzundel: Out of respect for the opposing positions stated here, I have opened a separate PR that removes all mention of DID Method Specifications #29.</p><p>Whichever PR achieves greater consensus, as determined by the chairs of the current DID WG, will be merged.</p>2023/01/24: <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/27#issuecomment-1402233965">https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/27#issuecomment-1402233965</a></blockquote>



<p></p>
  



<p>He did in fact create PR #29, which also led, at the request of @TallTed and @brentzundel to PR#30 to shift the entire focus of the charter to DID Resolution. However, neither of these alternatives were actually given serious consideration by the chairs:</p>



<p></p>



<blockquote><p>@brentzundel: It was never my understanding that a DID Resolution WG would replace the DID WG. I do not support that course of action. If folks are interested in pursuing a DID Resolution WG Charter separate from the DID WG Charter, the place to do it is not here.</p>2023/03/22: <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/30#pullrequestreview-1339576495">https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/30#pullrequestreview-1339576495</a> </blockquote>



<p>And again, in the comment announcing the chairs decision</p>



<blockquote><p>@brentzundel: However, because it would not be a DID Working Group, we have concluded that PR Proposal: Charter for the DID Resolution WG (as a replacement to current proposal) to continue the work of DID 1.0 #30 is no longer relevant to this conversation. We are leaving it open for those who wish to continue designing a separate DID Resolution-focused WG, but we do not expect such work to change the decision at this point.</p>2023/03/24: <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/27#issuecomment-1470920464">https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/27#issuecomment-1470920464</a></blockquote>



<p>Unfortunately, although the chairs’ obligations under the process was to consider all opposing positions and to find the proposal with the weakest objections, @brentzundel made it clear that when counter proposals were offered, they were not welcome. They were not discussed. They were not brought to the attention of the working group. They were summarily dismissed.</p>



 Radio Silence via other channels 



<p>Despite reaching out to the chairs via email in a personal letter, the chairs never directly responded or engaged in any fruitful dialog on this matter. The email was cited in the same comment as the previous in @brentzundel’s comment on #27 on </p>



<blockquote><p>@brentzundel I want to especially thank Joe for reaching out directly and engaging in a private conversation where we discussed this PR, the future of the WG, and the reasons we became involved in this work in the first place.</p>2023/01/24 <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/27#issuecomment-1402233965">https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/27#issuecomment-1402233965</a> :</blockquote>



<p>Frankly, @brentzundel’s assertion that “we discussed” anything is a fiction. He did not respond via email nor phone call nor any channels other than communicating his directives through Github comments.</p>



<p>After the recent VCWG face-to-face meeting in Miami, I pulled Brent aside to talk in person for a moment after everything wrapped. In that brief in-person conversation, I affirmed my disagreement with his current position. He restated his belief that this work isn’t “subject to consensus”, which I briefly debated. During this exchange, Brent said “I don’t care. I just don’t care.” He then asked me, as a point of clarification, if I intend to Formally Object if the current PR is merged. I repeated the same position I have made clear since TPAC in September. Yes. I would not only Formally Object, I would use all ethical and lawful means to oppose this decision, including filing an appeal of his decision to override dissent.</p>



 Denial 



<p>Brent has repeatedly denied that consensus applies to charter development:</p>



<blockquote><p>@brentzundel : There are no WG consensus requirements in establishing the text of the charter. </p>2022/12/15 <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/27#issuecomment-1353537492">https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/27#issuecomment-1353537492</a></blockquote>



<p>While Pierre-Antoine has no problem acknowledging that consensus matters:</p>



<blockquote><p>@pchampin We clearly didn’t manage to reach consensus here.</p>2023/01/11 <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/27#issuecomment-1379253408">https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/27#issuecomment-1379253408</a></blockquote>



<p>Surprisingly, in that same comment from Brent, he confirms my position:</p>



<blockquote><p>@brentzundel Consensus must be found by the WG for any items developed in the WG, regardless of what the charter allows. </p>2022/12/15 <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/27#issuecomment-1353537492">https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/27#issuecomment-1353537492</a></blockquote>



<p>Somehow he wants to be able to act as the chair in this matter, using his authority as chair to direct the output of the group towards a particular charter with particular language, but he simultaneously denies that the Charter is an “item” developed by the WG, despite it being done with DID WG resources, by the DID WG participants, under the leadership of the DID WG chairs.</p>



<p>In person, and in various GitHub issues and on Working Group calls, when faced with diverse opinions, unfortunately, it is an all too common response from Brent that “consensus doesn’t apply.”</p>



 Deference to political priorities over technical discussion 



<p>A significant frustration during this discussion was the repeated deference to non-technical factors rather than focusing on technical distinctions. Rather than debating what would make the most technical sense, the vast majority of arguments for the chairs’ position were political. Not once did the Chairs put forth any arguments other than deference to the perceived requirement from the Director.</p>



<p>Political factors are inevitable, but it is through technical discussion that the work of the W3C moves forward. The nature of standardization is the forging of alignment between competing interests so that the net result satisfies the greatest value. While we may have different tests for what comprises “value”, it is understood that some collective notion of shared benefit, as perceived by the working group, is the driving goal of collaboratively working through our differences. Each participant brings to the table their perspectives and through technical discussion the working group finds consensus around a shared specification that the W3C can formally recommend to the public as a global standard.</p>



<p>From the process document regarding consensus and dissent:</p>



<blockquote><p>Groups should favor proposals that create the weakest objections. This is preferred over proposals that are supported by a large majority but that cause strong objections from a few people.</p><a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/Process-20211102/#managing-dissent">https://www.w3.org/2021/Process-20211102/#managing-dissent</a> </blockquote>



<p>Takeaway point: the group should favor the proposals with the weakest objections.</p>



<p>And</p>



<blockquote><p>A group should only conduct a vote to resolve a substantive issue after the Chair has determined that all available means of reaching consensus through technical discussion and compromise have failed, and that a vote is necessary to break a deadlock.</p><a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/Process-20211102/#Votes">https://www.w3.org/2021/Process-20211102/#Votes</a></blockquote>



<p></p>



<p>Takeaway point: resolving dissent should occur through technical discussion.</p>



<p>Later in the document, it discusses how a group formally addresses an issue:</p>



<blockquote><p>In the context of this document, a group has formally addressed an issue when it has sent a public, substantive response to the reviewer who raised the issue. A substantive response is expected to include rationale for decisions (e.g., a technical explanation, a pointer to charter scope, or a pointer to a requirements document). The adequacy of a response is measured against what a W3C reviewer would generally consider to be technically sound.</p><a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/Process-20211102/#formal-address">https://www.w3.org/2021/Process-20211102/#formal-address</a></blockquote>



<p></p>



<p>Takeaway point: Adequacy of a response depends on technical soundness.</p>



<p>And the following from Section 5.4 Reopening a Decision When Presented With New Information:</p>



<blockquote><p>The Chair may reopen a decision when presented with new information, including:</p><p>* additional technical information</p><p>* comments by email from participants who were unable to attend a scheduled meeting,</p><p>* comments by email from meeting attendees who chose not to speak out during a meeting (e.g., so they could confer later with colleagues or for cultural reasons).</p><a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/Process-20211102/#WGChairReopen">https://www.w3.org/2021/Process-20211102/#WGChairReopen</a></blockquote>



<p></p>



<p>Takeaway point: reopening a decision is appropriate for new technical information not new political information (unless by email from participants who didn’t get their input in earlier).</p>



<p>In summary:</p>



  The group should favor the proposals with the weakest objections.  Resolving dissent should occur through technical discussion.  Adequacy of a response depends on technical soundness.  Reopening a decision is appropriate for new technical information not new political information  



<p>I interpret this to mean that resolving consensus per the W3C process SHOULD depend on considering competing proposals based on technical discussions and selecting the proposal that has the weakest technical objections.</p>



<p>That did not happen in this case.</p>



<p>Three alternative PRs were under consideration.</p>



<p>PR#27, the PR that explicitly added DID methods as in scope. <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/27">https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/27</a></p>



<p>PR#29, a PR alternative suggested by @brentzundel that removed DID methods from the scope, with minimal other changes. <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/29">https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/29</a></p>



<p>PR#30, a PR alternative suggested by @christopherallen that put forth a DID Resolution WG charter to focus the group on the next step in interoperability and to avoid the alleged mandate from the Director that the next DID WG MUST standardize DID methods. <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/30">https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/30</a></p>



<p>PR#27 elicited several technical objections, including multiple participants who made it clear that both Formal Objections and an Appeal would be filed if this charter is put forth.</p>



<p>PR#29 triggered several statements of preference, on both sides, but only one technical objection.</p>



<p>PR#30 triggered a few statements of preference, on both sides, but no technical objections.</p>



<p>In the face of this evidence, both #29 or #30 had weaker technical objections than #27.</p>



 On Technical Objections 



<p>There is a legitimate question about what constitutes a technical objection. I rely on the process statement that responding to a formal objection must be what “a W3C reviewer would generally consider to be technically sound”.</p>



<p>Technical issues raised (all quotes from Github):</p>



  There is no DID Method ready for standardization. (technology is not ready)  Standardizing DID Methods is like standardizing websites. (layer violation)  There is a technical route to meet the letter and the spirit of the prior formal objectors’ request for further implementation guidance. It includes showing the transport layer using the DID Resolution specification, including its test cases, educating the formal objectors regarding what was achieved, and moving specification of example DID Methods outside this WG’s work items. (there’s a better route to technical interoperability)  We don’t want to give the impression that some DID methods are more “important” or “required” than others. (decentralization means no privileged parties)  We are told there is a mandate to include standardization of DID methods into the working group charter, but the parties that mandate this inclusion have not been actively involved in the WG process in the past, and there is no evidence that they plan to be involved in the future. This lack of active participation raises questions about the legitimacy of their mandate and the potential impact that these objections may have on the future of this standardization process. (consensus-driven technical standardization depends on participation)  If we work on any DID method/s, will this put it/them in a “blessed” state, against which no other DID method/s can possibly compete? I highly doubt it. Though, if it&nbsp;does, that would tend to indicate that all desirable features are fully optimized in that method; else, another method would be registered eventually if not immediately. (Dispute of technical issue #4)  



<p>Political Issues raised (all quotes from Github):</p>



  A given did method deserves its own working group (a different group would be better able to manage its own work)  I believe it is the case is that the WG must put forward a charter that will not be the subject of a Formal Objection again. (Avoiding Formal Objections is a political goal.)  It has been made abundantly clear by those who formally objected to the DID Specification v1.0 that in their view, a future charter that doesn’t include possible DID Methods will be rejected. (Avoiding rejection is a political goal.)  There is documented evidence that we were requested, or at least strongly encouraged (“should”), to include DID methods in the next charter. (Deferring to that suggestion in the face of dissent is a political choice.)  This does NOT say we&nbsp;will&nbsp;specify any DID methods. It does NOT say we will&nbsp;not&nbsp;specify anything to do with DID Resolution. It leaves the door open to either or both, which flexibility I and the (I believe, substantial) majority of the group …&nbsp;have talked about as both desirable and likely to be needed. (“Flexibility is desirable” is about retaining political authority, not a technical argument that such flexibility will improve the technology.)  There were formal objections and comments made to DID-CORE 1.0 expressing concerns around DID methods. but those objections were overruled with a comment that those concerns will be addressed in the future work. If recharter happens now, it would be appropriate to respect the above and mention DID methods in the charter. (Deference to prior objections is political, not technical.)  



<p>So there were both political and technical issues raised by various individuals. However, the question that the process requires the group consider is which proposal had the weakest technical objections. Let us look at the Github conversation on these three PRs.</p>



<p>The following table lists all of the group participants who commented on PRs #27, #29, and #30 (noting that we aren’t clear if the staff liaison should be counted as a participant with regard to consensus):</p>

<p>Summary</p>



&nbsp;#27#29#30Formal Objections Signaled300Comments in favor5+13.55Comments opposed52.52



<p>From this evaluation of the working group’s Github conversation, we see #30 has the weakest objections, followed by #29, with #27 having the strongest objections of all three proposals. This count includes both political and technical objections to make the strength of dissent even clearer. If we were to count only those objectors who cited technical arguments, the results would be even more favorable to PR#30.</p>



&nbsp;#27#29#30Formal Objections Signaled300Comments in favor5+13.55Technical Objections Raised510



<p>The decision making process led by the chairs did not “favor proposals that create the weakest objections”, a violation of W3C Process, Section 5.2.2 Managing Dissent <a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/Process-20211102/#managing-dissent">https://www.w3.org/2021/Process-20211102/#managing-dissent</a></p>



<p>I want to highlight a particular fact about these numbers. They represent a snapshot of a brief and incomplete conversation by the Working Group. One of the primary tenets of this appeal is that the chairs did not lead a discussion for the consideration and improvement of either of these alternative PRs. Once dissent was voiced, all conversation was effectively shut down. Instead, the working group should have further discussed the options represented by #29 and #30 and iterated on both to find the best single charter for the group to proceed. It is the failing to have this conversation—coupled with the expectation to blindly follow the directive of the chairs—that is the process violation at the heart of this appeal.</p>



<p>It is evident from comments in the discussion and in their final decision that any alternative to the chairs interpretation of the Director’s comments in responding to the DID Core Formal Objections, would be ignored. Quite simply, the chairs treated a suggestion from the Director as a mandate to override dissent instead of working together as a group to discover a better option.</p>



 Claims of “W3C Consensus” are erroneous, out of scope, and irrelevant 



<p>In announcing their decision to continue to override dissent (in the merging of #27) @brentzundel said:</p>



<blockquote><p>@brentzundel: The DID WG chairs have met. We have concluded that merging PR #27 will produce a charter that best represents the consensus of the DID Working Group participants over the past year.</p> 2023/03/15 <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/27#issuecomment-1470920464">https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/27#issuecomment-1470920464</a> </blockquote>



<p>Unfortunately, the chairs do not cite the basis of their assertion that #27 will produce a charter that best represents the consensus of the group. We have shown in this appeal that the discussion on Github does not justify such a conclusion.</p>



<p>Brent continues:</p>



<blockquote><p>The inclusion of DID Methods in the next chartered DID WG was part of the W3C Director’s decision to overturn the Formal Objections raised against the publication of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0. The chairs feel that that decision represents the consensus of the W3C and as such the inclusion of DID Methods as optional work in this charter is absolutely necessary.</p></blockquote>



<p>Unfortunately, it is not the chairs’ role to determine the consensus of the W3C, nor is it stated anywhere in the Process that chairs MUST defer to suggestions the Director made in response to previous Formal Objections to a different work product. In fact, as clarified by Phillippe Le Hégaret in regard to the Director’s response to those prior objections (in personal email):</p>



<blockquote><p>The “should” is NOT a “must”, otherwise it would say so explicitly in the Director’s decision. In other words, the Working Group is allowed to disagree with the direction set by the Director.</p> Phillippe Le Hégaret, personal email, 2023/03/23 </blockquote>



<p>The chairs interpretation of the Director’s response as a mandate is contrary to W3C Process. There is no requirement from the Director in this matter. The chairs incorrectly claim that there is, stating that a W3C Consensus exists that somehow overrides the group’s independent authority. They have used this claim as the fundamental justification for overriding dissent.</p>



<p>The claim of a W3C Consensus is erroneous because the W3C as a whole never had an opportunity to voice their position on the claimed consensus. The response from the Director was a statement resolving an immediate set of objections, stating his suggestion for future work. It was not a statement of W3C consensus requiring the DID WG to charter a new DID WG with methods in scope.</p>



<p>The claim of W3C Consensus is out of scope because the Chairs do not have the authority to assess consensus and speak on behalf of the W3C.</p>



<p>The claim of W3C Consensus is irrelevant because the statement by the chairs is justifying an action by the Chairs regarding an output of the WG. It is not about an action of the W3C.</p>



<p>Even if the W3C as a whole did, in fact, have some sort of consensus on this topic, that alone would not restrict the group from having a different consensus. Of course, a working group may reach a different consensus than the W3C as a whole—after all there are two different groups of participants with different opinions, perspectives, and decision making processes. As such, the consensus of the W3C as a whole is necessarily NOT the same as the consensus of the Working Group. Claims of W3C consensus by the chairs is not only outside their remit, such a “W3C Consensus” should not be taken to require that the WG reach the same conclusion.</p>



<p>Claiming anything about a supposed “W3C consensus” that restricts the actions of the WG is erroneous, out of scope, and irrelevant.</p>



 This sets a untenable precedent 



<p>The W3C is at a crossroads. Built on trust in the benevolence of Sir Tim Berners Lee, the organization is wrestling with adjusting the process and governance bodies away from a strict dependence on the Director to make major decisions. I appreciate the challenge the organization is facing is like changing the engines on an aircraft in flight. It’s hard. We are in uncharted territory as the organization explores improvements to the Process to deal with this inevitable transition. However, confirming deference to staff as justification for the disregard of legitimate dissent is both inconsistent with the tradition and culture of the W3C and incompatible with an organization whose premise relies on technical cooperation and collaboration. From the W3C mission statement <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/mission">https://www.w3.org/Consortium/mission</a>:</p>



<p>Our Identity “We are an open forum where diverse voices from around the world and industries come together, incubate and build consensus for global standards for web technologies.”</p>



<p>Our Strategic Goals</p>



  Improve efforts on new technology incubation, making it more structured and improving consensus-building among key stake holders.  Achieve worldwide participation, diversity and inclusion, establishing W3C as representative of the worldwide community.  Further improve the environment for facilitating balance, equity and cooperation among the participants from different industries, user groups and organizational sizes.  Increase involvement of under-represented key stakeholders such as end users, content creators, developers etc.  



<p>Emphasis mine.</p>



<p>It is our opinion that if the W3C chooses to interpret staff suggestions as mandates that override working group consensus it will fail to achieve the explicit goals of the organization’s mission.</p>



<p>Shutting down conversation and ignoring dissent does not</p>



  provide an open forum.  improve consensus building.  achieve participation, diversity and inclusion.  facilitate balance, equity and cooperation among participants.  increase involvement of under-represented key stakeholders.  



<p>From the W3C Process Document</p>



<blockquote><p>W3C work revolves around the standardization of Web technologies. To accomplish this work, W3C follows processes that promote the development of high-quality standards based on the consensus of the Membership, Team, and public. W3C processes promote fairness, responsiveness, and progress: all facets of the W3C mission.</p><p>The W3C Process promotes the goals of quality and fairness in technical decisions by encouraging consensus, soliciting reviews (by both Members and public), incorporating implementation and interoperability experience, and requiring Membership-wide approval as part of the technical report development process.</p><a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/Process-20211102">https://www.w3.org/2021/Process-20211102</a></blockquote>



<p>The W3C Process Document lays out the principles and the practices that enable the W3C to legitimately develop standards based on the consensus of its contributors.</p>



<p>If the Director confirms the Chair decision to ignore dissent on this matter, it will set the precedent that Working Group chairs are free to ignore the W3C process should their own opinion coincide with a suggestion from staff. This will transform the organization into a politically driven autocracy that lacks the moral authority of legitimate consensus.</p>



<p>Instead of assisting the W3C in its transition away from a top-down autocratic governance based on the moral authority of Sir Tim Berners Lee to something more meritocratic, confirming the Chairs decision would establish that decisions at the W3C flow from staff down and not from the collaborative, technical discourse of its members.</p>



 Proposals with the weakest objections should be favored 



<p>The process document states:</p>



<blockquote><p>Groups should favor proposals that create the weakest objections. This is preferred over proposals that are supported by a large majority but that cause strong objections from a few people.</p><a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/Process-20211102/#managing-dissent">https://www.w3.org/2021/Process-20211102/#managing-dissent</a></blockquote>



<p>By this metric, PR#29 or #30 should have prevailed. If you exclude the staff liaison from the tally, you have an equal measure of preference and opposition to #27, including 3 intentions to formally object, plus my express intention to fight this decision with every lawful and ethical means at my disposal to oppose the inclusion of DID methods in the DID WG charter.</p>



<p>PR#27 didn’t even get support by a majority of the group and it absolutely caused strong objections from several of us. Even if you include @pchampin’s position, we barely have a majority in support of #27 with strong objections against. A bare majority and several strong objections from a few people does not meet the standard of Process.</p>



<p>Although I read the Chairs statement several times, I do not see how they could legitimately argue that the favored proposal has the weakest objections from participants in the working group.</p>



 Summary 



<p>I am asking the Director to reconsider and overturn the DID WG chairs decision to ignore dissent and force DID methods to be in scope for the next WG charter proposed by the Working Group.</p>



<p>Since the chairs are claiming a mandate from the Director as the justification for their decision, I am directly asking the Director if what is happening is, in fact, what the Director required.</p>



<p>I have shown that the chairs, in this case, have failed to pursue all available means to find the proposal with the weakest objections. They have instead imposed their own political agenda over considerable technically-grounded dissent.</p>



<p>To recap:</p>



  The Chair decision in question lacks consensus.  Consensus was not legitimately sought, contrary to W3C Process.  Chairs claims of an overriding “W3C Consensus” are erroneous, out of scope, and irrelevant.  Deferring to staff sets an untenable precedent for a group that prides itself on diversity and consensus-based decision making.  The proposal with the weakest objections should be favored.  



<p>I hope that the Director will appreciate these arguments and provide guidance that will remove this unfortunate notion that a Working Group’s chairs must defer to mere suggestions by staff. All Working Groups deserve the ability to manage their own work and find their own consensus without imposition from staff.</p>



<p>In particular, I’d like to see the following remedy from the Director:</p>



  Clarification: does the Director’s response to the Formal Objections to DID Core 1.0 constitute a direct requirement that the Working Group MUST explicitly charter a subsequent DID WG with DID Methods in scope?  Clarification: does the Director’s response to the Formal Objections to DID Core 1.0 constitute a direct requirement that the Working Group MUST NOT charter a DID Resolution WG instead of a DID WG?  Clarification: What is the role of technical versus political objections when seeking consensus, especially what constitutes a technical objection?  Clarification: What are the requirements of the chairs to seek proposals with the weakest objections?  Direction for the DID WG chairs to facilitate a conversation to find better alternatives to including DID methods in the next WG charter, specifically to advance either a true maintenance mode DID WG charter (without license for new specifications) or advance a DID Resolution WG charter instead (focusing new specifications on resolution).  



<p>When I got involved with this work, I shared many of my colleagues’ concerns about whether or not the W3C has the cultural and institutional wherewithal to stand as a steward for decentralized technologies. Given the organization’s history with many of the largest companies in the world, significant concerns have been voiced about whether or not the keeper of the Web can handle innovations that challenge the corporate dominance of web standards. &nbsp;</p>



<p>After the Verifiable Credentials specification was approved as a Recommendation, many of us were hopeful. Then, the DID Core specification took an unprecedented fight before it eventually became a W3C Recommendation. The fight was disheartening, but the ultimate approval gave us cautious hope.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, with @BrentZundel’s unwavering demand that the WG advance a charter that overrides consensus to placate a suggestion from staff, I am again given cause to wonder if the W3C is capable of advancing collaborative work based on true consensus rather than political deference. This appeal puts that notion to the test. It is my sincere hope that the W3C will prove true to its mission and its process and recognize the unfortunate error of the chairs, restoring consensus to the heart of our collective work.</p>



<p>Finally, I want to apologize again to the chairs, Brent Zundel and Dan Burnett, as I have already done personally and in our related Github discussion. Both Brent and Dan are great guys, two of the nicest people you’ll meet in standards development. I consider both of them friends and I’m deeply saddened that this matter has become a public conflict with its inevitable consequences for all of us.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, I find myself in an existential disagreement with a decision they have made collectively in their role as chairs of the WG. As outlined above, I believe the path the chairs have chosen fundamentally undermines the work to which I have dedicated my professional life.</p>



<p>It’s not just that this is an unfortunate decision. It is a decision that I am compelled to oppose with all of the lawful and ethical means at my disposal. This opposition is not personal. I know Brent and Dan are doing their best. Unfortunately, in this case, I find their best falls short of the requirements of their role. I sincerely wish the path to resolve this matter didn’t take us to a nasty public fight. I made eighteen separate comments on the PRs in question trying to convince the chairs of the merit of my argument before escalating. I tried. I’m sorry I wasn’t able to resolve this without calling for intervention.</p>



<p>Thank you for your time and attention. I know this is a lot of material to digest and I appreciate the effort that everyone has made to advance this conversation in a civil and professional manner.</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>



<p>-j</p>

My original Mastodon account was on <a href="https://mastodon.social">mastodon.social</a>. I chose it because it’s the largest instance, it’s operated by the developers of the service, and it runs the reference implementation of the software. I wanted to experience the fediverse, initially, as most people do, then consider whether to migrate to another server — and if so, to which one.</p>
<p>
Last week I migrated to <a href="https://social.coop">social.coop</a> which, like <a href="https://cosocial.ca">cosocial.ca</a>, it what <a href="https://tinysubversions.com/">Darius Kazemi</a> calls a <a href="https://elk.zone/social.coop/@darius@friend.camp/110147686846784173">community-owned independent social media site</a>. I don’t think the acronym COISMS will fly, but the business model is just what I’ve been looking for. I don’t want to use  “free” services that make me the product they sell. I want to pay for a service that’s funded by my dollars, not by my data. That’s why I bailed on Gmail years ago, in favor of Fastmail, and it’s why I’m happy to spend $10/month — the price of a couple of cappucinos — to support the people who keep the lights on at social.coop and maintain civility.</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/moving/">instructions</a> for migrating from one server offer two paths: Profile redirect and Profile move. I chose the former, because I assumed I would retain API access to mastodon.social post-migration, and thus have the option to use Steampipe to query both accounts. Why do that? You can’t migrate your posts from the old server to the new one, only your followers and (optionally) your follows, bookmarks, blocks, and mutes. Steampipe can connect to two different Mastodon servers at the same time, so I figured I could run queries against both.</p>
 Lessons learned 
<p>
That turned out to be a wrong assumption. I can reactivate my mastodon.social account by turning off the redirection, but I’m vague on the implications of doing that. Meanwhile it’s still possible to export my posts, so I can always reacquire them that way if needed. </p>
<p>
Here was another wrong assumption. I think that if I’d chosen to move my account, instead of redirect it, my profile would have transferred to the new server. Instead it was on me to fill out the new profile. I’d created @judell@social.coop but, when I kicked off the migration, I hadn’t yet completed the profile. So when followers were notified that judell@social.coop was now following them, there was no picture or bio or verified website. That led some people to think it was a bogus account and block it. It wasn’t a catastrophe, and I’ve spoken with a few of them to resolve the matter, but it was an unforced error that would have been easy to avoid.</p>
 The view from here 
<p>
Here’s a comparison of weekly activity on two servers, by way of the <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-mastodon-insights/blob/main/server.sp">server dashboard</a>.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.net/images/mastodon-social-vs-social-coop-weekly-activity.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>
What’s it like moving to a server with only 1% of the flow that happens on mastodon.social? Not too different! Because I’ve moved my followers and follows, and because I interact primarily with the home timeline and with lists, the experience is mostly the same. For example, here’s the graph of <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-mastodon-insights/blob/main/boosts_federated.sp">boost relationships</a> among servers in my home timeline. It looks just like it did before.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://jonudell.net/images/server-neighborhoods-from-social-coop"></a></p>
<p>
It’s wonderful to have a portable social graph that you can bring along as you move around in the fediverse. The key differences are that I’m meeting new people, and spending more time on the local timeline. On a big server like mastodon.social the local timeline feels like the Twitter firehose, for those who remember when that was still a thing you could watch. I’d look at it occasionally, because it could be a source of useful serendipity, but mostly it was just too random. The local timeline on social.coop is still somewhat random, but I find it more useful — not only because it represents a far smaller population but also because the people who’ve signed up share a common interest in the coop model. </p>
 I want my lists 
<p>
There was, however, one big obstacle. You can export lists from the old server and import them into the new server, but there’s no export/import for the accounts you’ve assigned to those lists. Since I <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2022/12/22/lists-and-people-on-mastodon/">rely heavily on lists</a> to navigate Mastodon flow in a focused and intentional way, this was a problem I really needed to fix. I tried Eliot Nash’s <a href="https://github.com/fadookie/masto-list-importer">masto-list-importer</a> but when I tried to transfer my 460 person/list mappings I hit API rate limits. So instead I worked out a Steampipe-based solution which is a useful alternative, and also a good way to illustrate the steps involved.</p>
<p>
Let’s assume that I want to migrate again, from social.coop to fosstodon.org. I’ve exported the names of my lists from social.coop, and imported them to fosstodon.org. Now I need to populate those lists. The SQL solution I came up with proceeds by steps, each being a common table expression (CTE) that accomplishes one part of a complex transformation, then passes results to the next step. </p>
<p>
Step 1: Gather the accounts assigned to each social.coop list.</p>
<p>
We start by joining two tables to enumerate accounts assigned to each list.</p>
   with accounts_by_list as (
  select 
    a.acct as old_account,
    a.id as old_account_id,
    l.id as old_list_id,
    l.title as title
  from
    social_coop.mastodon_my_list l
  join
     social_coop.mastodon_list_account a
  on
    l.id = a.list_id
)
select * from accounts_by_list
 
<p>
The output, in accounts_by_list, is effectively a temporary table that you can review to make sure the results are as expected. The ability to verify the output of each phase of a CTE pipeline, before sending it to the next phase, is a key advantage of this approach. Nested subqueries are much harder to debug!</p>
<p>
Step 2: Map the accounts on social.coop to accounts on fosstodon.org</p>
<p>
Two transformations happen in this phase. If an account is a bare username, say personA, then it’s a social.coop account. On fosstodon.org that same account will be represented as personA@social.coop. Conversely if personB@fosstodon.org exists on social.coop, that account becomes the bare username personB there. All other accounts (e.g. personC@hachyderm.io pass through unchanged.</p>
 with accounts_by_list as (
  -- as above
),
adjusted_accounts_by_list as (
  select
    old_account,
    old_account_id,
    old_list_id,
    title,
    case 
      when old_account !~ '@' then old_account || '@social.coop' 
      when old_account ~ '@fosstodon.org' then replace(old_account, '@fosstodon.org', '')
      else old_account
    end as new_account
  from
     accounts_by_list
)
select * from adjusted_accounts_by_list
 
<p>
Step 3: Map the list titles to the new server.</p>
<p>
The names of the lists are the same in both places, but their ids differ. For example, my Fediverse list is 1043 on social.coop and 6771. To invoke the API call that <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/lists/#accounts-add">adds someone to a list</a>, we’ll need to use the latter id.</p>
 with accounts_by_list as (
  -- as above
),
adjusted_accounts_by_list as (
  -- as above
),
adjusted_list_ids as (
  select
    a.*,
    l.id as new_list_id
  from
    adjusted_accounts_by_list a
  join
    fosstodon.mastodon_my_list l
  on
    a.title = l.title
)
select * from adjusted_list_ids
 
<p>
Step 4: Map the account ids to the new server.</p>
<p>
Like lists, accounts on the new server also have different ids, and those are also required for the API call. We can find the new ids by joining the new_account column from step one with the table fosstodon.mastodon_my_following.</p>
 with accounts_by_list as (
  -- as above
),
adjusted_accounts_by_list as (
  -- as above
),
adjusted_list_ids as (
  -- as above
,
),
adjusted_account_ids as (
  select 
    a.*,
    f.id as new_account_id
  from
    adjusted_list_ids a
  join
    fosstodon.mastodon_my_following f
  on
    f.acct = a.new_account
)
select * from adjusted_account_ids
 
<p>
Step 5: Build the API calls</p>
<p>
There are lots of ways to skin this cat. Because you can use Steampipe <a href="https://steampipe.io/blog/steampipe-as-component">as a component</a>, you could use any programming language with a Postgres driver to run this query, and call the Mastodon API with the appropriate list and account ids.</p>
<p>
And then, of course, there’s always curl.</p>
 with accounts_by_list as (
  -- as above
),
adjusted_accounts_by_list as (
  -- as above
),
adjusted_list_ids as (
  -- as above
),
adjusted_account_ids as (
  -- as above
)
select
  'curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer ***" https://fosstodon.org/api/v1/lists/' ||
  new_list_id ||
  '/accounts/?' ||
  'account_ids[]=' ||
  new_account_id ||
  '; sleep 1;' as command
 
<p>
To avoid throttling, I appended sleep 1 to each line. I saved the query in migrate-lists.sql, and exported the output to a file.</p>
 steampipe query --output csv migrate-lists.sql &gt; migrate.sh
 
<p>
That was close, but not quite right. The output looked like this:</p>
 command
"curl -X POST -H ""Authorization: Bearer ***"" https://fosstodon.org/api/v1/lists/6771/accounts/?account_ids[]=279462; sleep 1;"
"curl -X POST -H ""Authorization: Bearer ***"" https://fosstodon.org/api/v1/lists/6771/accounts/?account_ids[]=109283421559929728; sleep 1;"
 
<p>
I need to remove the header line, remove the double quotes on either end of each line, and deduplicate the pairs of double quotes. For that I turned to ChatGPT (v4). It took a few tries to get it right, but soon enough it produced a working bash script that I’m very glad I did not have to write.</p>
 #!/bin/bash

# read the original script from migrate.sh and store it in an array
readarray -t original_script &lt; migrate.sh

# remove the first line of the original script
modified_script=("${original_script[@]:1}")

# loop through the modified script array and replace double double-quotes with a single double-quote and remove double quotes at the beginning and end of each line
for (( i=0; i&lt;${#modified_script[@]}; i++ )); do
    modified_script[$i]=$(sed 's/""/"/g' &lt;&lt;&lt; "${modified_script[$i]}")
    modified_script[$i]=$(sed 's/^"//' &lt;&lt;&lt; "${modified_script[$i]}")
    modified_script[$i]=$(sed 's/"$//' &lt;&lt;&lt; "${modified_script[$i]}")
done

# print out the modified script with newlines
printf '%s\n' "${modified_script[@]}"
 
<p>
And that did the trick. With my lists now fully populated on social.coop, I'm now reading Mastodon from my new home server in the same list-oriented way as I was on the old one. </p>
<p>
If you move servers and want to migrate the people on your lists, you should definitely try <a href="https://www.eliotlash.com/masto-list-importer/">masto-list-importer</a> first, and consider the method here as fallback if that doesn't work for you. I agree with Eliot Nash that list transfer ought to be baked into the Mastodon UI. People rightly complain that it can be hard to find the people you want to follow and topics you want to explore. You can follow hashtags but that can be too random. Assigning people to topical lists strikes a good balance. But only if those list assignments are portable!</p>

<p>Some of the following is excerpted from my new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1098117697/technometria-20">Learning Digital Identity</a> from O'Reilly Media.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01c94532-ab60-4f7f-a7bb-8dcd45f5ca65_502x644.png">    </a> <p>OAuth was invented for a very specific purpose: to allow people to control access to resources associated with their accounts, without requiring that they share authentication factors. A primary use case for OAuth is accessing data in an account using an API. For example, the <a href="https://receiptify.herokuapp.com/">Receiptify service</a> creates a list of your recent listening history on Spotify, Last.fm, or Apple Music that looks like a shopping receipt. Here's a sample receipt of some of my listening history.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa4c2b8fd-a1e1-458b-92b5-40960c62ef92_272x722.png">    </a>Receiptify Listening History <p>Before OAuth, if Alice (the resource owner) wanted Receiptify (the client) to have access to her history on Spotify (the resource server), she'd give Receiptify her username and password on Spotify. Receiptify would store the username and password and impersonate Alice each time it needs to access Spotify on her behalf. By using Alice's username and password, Receiptify would demonstrate that it had Alice's implicit permission to access her data on Spotify. This is sometimes called the "password antipattern" and it has several serious drawbacks:</p>  <p>The resource server can't differentiate between the user and other servers accessing the API.</p>  <p>Storing passwords on other servers increases the risk of a security breach.</p>  <p>Granular permissions are hard to support since the resource server doesn't know who is logging in.</p>  <p>Passwords are difficult to revoke and must be updated in multiple places when changed.</p>  <p>OAuth was designed to fix these problems by making the resource server part of the flow that delegates access. This design lets the resource server ask the resource owner what permissions to grant and records them for the specific client requesting access. Moreover, the client can be given its own credential, apart from those that the resource owner has or those used by other clients the user might have authorized.</p> OAuth Scopes <p>The page that allows the owner to grant or deny permission might display what permissions the RS is requesting. This isn't freeform text written by a UX designer; rather, it's controlled by scopes. A scope is a bundle of permissions that the client asks for when requesting the token, coded by the developer who wrote the client.</p><p>The following screenshots show the permissions screens that I, as the owner of my Twitter account, see for two different applications, Revue and Thread Reader.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff580db76-f7a9-495e-a8a5-dc322c8c717b_1105x686.png">    </a>OAuth Scopes Displayed in the Permission Screen <p>There are several things to note about these authorization screens. First, Twitter is presenting these screens, not the clients (note the URL in the browser window). Second, the two client applications are asking for quite different scopes. Revue wants permission to update my profile as well as post and delete tweets, while Thread Reader is only asking for read-only access to my account. Finally, Twitter is making it clear to me who is requesting access. At the bottom of the page, Twitter warns me to be careful and to check the permissions that the client is asking for.</p> Fine-Grained Permissions <p>Scopes were designed so that the service offering an API could define the relatively course-grained permissions needed to access it. So, Twitter, for example, has scopes like <code>tweet.read</code> and <code>tweet:write</code>. As shown above, when a service wants to use the API for my Twitter account, it has to ask for specific scopes—if it only wants to read my tweets, it would ask for <code>tweet:read</code>. Once granted, they can be used with the API endpoint to gain access.</p><p>But OAuth-style scopes aren't the best tool for fine-grained permissioning in applications. To see why, imagine you are building a photo sharing app that allows a photographer like Alice to grant her friends Betty and Charlie permission to view her vacation photos. Unlike the Twitter API, where the resources are fairly static (users and tweets, for example) and you're granting permissions to a fairly small number of applications on an infrequent basis, the photo sharing app has an indeterminant number of resources that change frequently. Consequently, the app would need to have many scopes and update them each time a user grants new permissions on a photo album to some other user. A large photo sharing service might have a million users and 50 million photo albums—that's a lot of potential scopes.</p><p>Policy-based Access Control (PBAC) systems, on the other hand, were built for this kind of permissioning. As I wrote in <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2023/03/not_all_pbac_is_abac_access_management_patterns.shtml">Not all PBAC is ABAC</a>, your app design and how you choose to express policies make a big difference in the number of policies you need to write. But regardless, PBAC systems, with good policy stores, can manage policies and the information needed to build the authorization context much more easily than you'll usually find in an OAuth-based system.</p><p>So, if you're looking to allow client applications to access your API on behalf of your customers, then OAuth is the right tool. But if you're building an application that allows sharing between its users of whatever resources they build, then you need the fine-grained permissioning that a policy-based access control system provides.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Her name is Mary Johnson. Born in 1917, the year the U.S. entered WWI, two years before women in the same country got the right to vote, she died in 1944, not long before the end of WWII. She was buried, unembalmed, in the cemetery of a Chicago church that was later abandoned. Her grave was unmarked. To make room for new commercial development in 2023, the church was razed and occupants of the cemetery were respectfully and quietly disinterred, and moved to a working cemetery elsewhere in town. In the midst, efforts were made by the coroner’s office to discover the identities of the bodies from unmarked graves before they were to be reburied. Mary’s was among them.</p>
<p>The difference with Mary was that her body appeared to be unchanged: a bit dusty under bits of casket lining, with light flecks on her dark skin. Except for that, she looked like she had died yesterday. When they removed her body from the casket in the hospital morgue where she was taken for DNA sampling, she was still flexible. I asked the pathologist what would account for her perfect state of preservation. The pathologist said she had no idea. Even the best embalming jobs age in the ground.</p>
<p>When the pathologist was out of the room, I reached to lift one of Mary’s eyelids. Before my fingers touched, both lids opened, slightly. I called out, “Come here! Come here!” Nobody came. Then both eyes opened. Her body shook as she tried to breathe.</p>
<p>“Code Blue! I yelled.</p>
<p>She was alive. Somehow, alive. After what, eighty years? At the time we didn’t know.</p>
<p>I was ready to do CPR when she started breathing and&nbsp;tried to sit up. “Hang on,” I said. Let me help.” As I did, she was becoming warm. She stood up and looked around.</p>
<p>I looked at my watch. It was 5:15 AM. The dream was too interesting for me to completely awaken, so I dropped back in. As a half-conscious dreamer, I often do that. For the next hour, I followed several different story threads. Each visited what happened in the eighty years of Mary’s suspended life. The Cold War. israel. Civil rights. Rock &amp; Roll. Space travel. Disco. Hip hop. Rap. Digital everything. One of her questions: “What’s television?”</p>
<p>I thought about the backstory of her own short life: a child in the twenties, a teen during the Depression, a young adult during The War. What interesting stuff happened in those years? Was she in love, maybe with a guy who went off to fight? What work did she do?</p>
<p>I thought about the science questions. How was it possible for someone to lay undead for so long? Who else in that cemetery, or any cemetery, might still be alive? Was she a one-of-one, a one-of-some, or a one-of-many? Though not a horror story, it did recall Poe’s <a href="https://labs.openai.com/e/TTuAmABtYlVZi4QlErQKMTqA/QQEIMGPU7h2UYwG1pBpg2iKC">The Premeture Burial</a>, in which the protagonist’s undead state was “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalepsy">catalepsy</a>.” I imagined in this thread that the story might be one&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Crichton">Michael Chrichton</a> would like to write, if he was still alive.</p>
<p>Dreams have no more detail than one gives them, and being a white guy from New Jersey, born after Mary went cataleptic, I didn’t have much to furnish any storyline about Mary’s life, past or present. But I could still think of questions to address. What perspective and wisdom could Mary bring to our time? How would she cope with finding nearly all the people and things she knew were now dead and gone? What would she marvel at, and what would appall her? What would she be, or mean, to the rest of us?</p>
<p>No surprise that I would dream of a resurrection on Easter morning, even though that wasn’t in my head at the time. So, might Mary (not hard to guess from what corner of my unconscious that one came from) be a Jesus for our time? Hmm.</p>
<p>At 6:15, I finally had to get up and do my business, and the dream ended there. Still, “This has to be a book,” I told myself. But I have other books to write, ones that have sat half-written for years. And writing fiction isn’t my thing. So I decided I’d blog it instead. And here we are.</p>
<p>She is alive now, on this page, and in your mind. All she needs is for someone to finish her story.</p>

 【編集後記】 



 放送の内容 



<p>現在再放送予定はないが、<a href="https://www.nhk.jp/p/ts/1M3MYJGG6G/blog/bl/pp2BabPyzp/bp/pzZJMWpvAz/">https://www.nhk.jp/p/ts/1M3MYJGG6G/blog/bl/pp2BabPyzp/bp/pzZJMWpvAz/</a> で概要は追うことができる。NHKオンデマンドで見れるようになって、それをみなで同時視聴しながら、止めながら解説入れたりしながら見れたりすると良いのですけどね。何しろ背景のイラストに実は大きな意味が込められていたりするハイコンテクスト番組なので。</p>



<p>以下、そうしたものいくつかご紹介。</p>



 背景にあった古代ギリシャ民主政の絵について 



<p>イエナガ「web3って僕らを自由にしてくれるものだから」発言の後ろ側に古代ギリシャ民主政の絵があるが、そこで言わんとしていたことの背景には、プラトン『国家』の第8巻がある。</p>



<blockquote>
<p>「この＜自由＞こそは、民主政国家がもっている最も善きもの」「それへのあくなき要求と、他のすべてへの無関心から」「無政府状態にに侵され」「僭主独裁制がそこから生まれでてくる」<br>「僭主独裁性が成立するのは、民主制以外の他のどのような国制からでもない。最高度の自由からは、最も野蛮な最高度の隷属が生まれてくる」</p>
（出所）プラトン『国家』第8巻</blockquote>



 ねずみと歯車のイラスト 



<p>これは、チャップリンのモダンタイムスの暗喩。人間が無機質な歯車に動かされている状態という DAOの比喩。</p>



 Web 2.0 の初出について 



<p>Tim O’ReilyのWeb2.0は多くの文献で2005年ということになっていて、番組でも2005年となっているが実際には遅くとも2004年。2004年11月のRead/Write Web Interviewに言及がある。</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Read/Write Web Interview: Web 2.0 — November 2004. In Part 1 of this Read/Write Web interview, I talk with Richard MacManus about the Web 2.0 Conference, the relationships between Apple and the web and Microsoft and the web, and data ownership and lock-in. In Part 2, we explore business models for web content, including discussion of RSS. And Part 3 focuses on eBooks, social networking, collaboration, and Remix culture.</p>

attract more developers and users. Note that obviously, not all these items are of similar

<p>Your feedback – and help making it so – very much appreciated!</p>
 
 Standards maintenance work on the core specifications 
 Fixes to the the core spec 
 
 According to reports, ActivityPub as-is is incompatible with common shared hosting environments
(e.g. typical WordPress host), as it requires HTTP content negotiation. 
 Issues backlog 
 
 A design to reduce certain loads 
 
 Reduce protocol chattiness 
 Fan-out 
 Video 
 (Not my area of expertise, so I don’t have details) 
 
 Decide on the future of ActivityPub Client-to-Server 
 
 Split the C2S spec from the S2S spec? 
 Standardize the Mastodon API instead? 
 Invest in convincing developers to implement it? 
 
 Significant extensions of the core specifications with a view on standardizing them 
 Improved security and privacy 
 
 Signed content 
 Private messages 
 
 A standardized way to express terms under which content is provided 
 
 As I understand it, Bob Wyman calls that a Rights Expression Language 
 This probably should start with a use case collection 
 
 Profiles 
 A single-document basic [Fediverse] interop spec, ie. 
 
 when I have written code for everything it says, my code will interoperate in some basic fashion with all other software that has implemented this document 
 no need to consult or understand other implementations 
 may be quite basic, e.g. text content only, only a minimal set of activity types 
 enables implementors to have a “MVP”-style interop at lowest-possible engineering effort (including the time required to read/understand the specs!) 
 This could be done as a “minimal profile” of a stack that contains a subset of AP [ActivityPub], AS [ActivityStreams], and Webfinger 
 
 Other profiles for specific use cases 
 
 E.g. propagation of event / calendar invites / RSVPs 
 
 Documentation and test 
 A test suite for the minimal profile 
 
 suitable to add to automated test suites 
 over time, this test suite can grow beyond the minimal profile 
 
 Documented behavior of leading ActivityPub implementations 
 
 What subset of the spec does each implement 
 What extensions does it implement, and which are required 
 Document the “folk wisdom” how to interact with a given implementation, so not every
new developer has to learn everything from scratch 
 Get out of “trial and error mode” when attempting to interoperate with another ActivityPub implementation 
 
 A branding program for products that have passed the test suite 
 
 As an implementor, you get to put the sticker on your product. 
 In particular, in the places in the product where users “connect” to other servers in the Fediverse, like “Visa” is displayed at the POS terminal 
 I believe this will become critical if/when larger orgs with potentially different value systems connect to the Fediverse 
 
 JSON-LD conformance 
 
 Tests to make sure implementations are JSON-LD conformant 
 
 Libraries in the major languages 
 
 Full stack, not just ActivityPub 
 
 User expectations and usability across the Fediverse 
 A set of web “intent buttons” for Like, Follow, Post, etc that work across sites 
 
 like they exist for centralized social media 
 as easy to use for the user 
 we can argue how this can be accomplished technically. I have opinions, but for this wish list, they are immaterial, as long as I get those buttons :-) 
 
 A design for search that meets the requirements of all relevant parties and points of view 
 
 This is probably far less a technical problem than one of successful communication 
 
 Best practices for content propagation 
 
 E.g. resolve the “It has 5 likes here but 10 over there” issue and related. 
 
 Improved identity management across the Fediverse 
 
 Easy-to-use single-sign-on across servers. Use case: I use several apps for different content types (like micro blog and video). Bonus: they all post from the same identifier 
 Easy-to-use persona management. Use case: I have a personal and a work account, bonus if they can be on the same server 
 Identifiers not tied to the domain name system 
 
 Attract more participants 
 
 Get major implementors involved (e.g. Mastodon) 
 Make the place where technical work is done welcome and the work pleasant

<p>
When Twitter changed hands last November I switched to Mastodon; ever since I’ve enjoyed happier and more productive social networking. To enhance my happiness and productivity I began working on a Mastodon plugin for <a href="https://steampipe.io">Steampipe</a>. My initial goal was to study the fediverse writ large. Which people and which servers are powerful connectors? How do moderation policies work? What’s it like to join a small server versus a large one? These are important questions, and you can use the plugin to begin to answer them. But I soon realized that as a newcomer to a scene that’s been evolving for six years, and has not welcomed such analysis, I should start by looking for ways to enhance the experience of reading Mastodon. So I began building a set of <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-mastodon-insights">dashboards</a> that augment the stock Mastodon client or (my preference) <a href="https://elk.zone">elk.zone</a>. And I’ve narrated that project in a series of posts.</p>
<p>
Last week we released the plugin to <a href="https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/mastodon">the Steampipe hub</a>. If you’ve <a href="https://steampipe.io/downloads">installed Steampipe</a>, you can now get the plugin using steampipe plugin install mastodon. The next phases of this project will explore using the plugin and dashboards in <a href="https://cloud.steampipe.io">Steampipe Cloud</a>, and speeding up the dashboards by means of persistent Postgres tables and Steampipe Cloud snapshots. Meanwhile, here’s a recap of what I’ve learned thus far.</p>
 See more with less distraction 
<p>
While the dashboards use charts and relationship graphs, they are mainly tables of query results. Because Steampipe dashboards don’t (yet) render HTML, these views display plain text only — no images, no styled text. I’ve embraced this constraint, and I find it valuable in two ways. First, I’m able to scan many more posts at a glance than is possible in conventional clients, and more effectively choose which to engage with. When I described this effect to a friend he said: “It’s a <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3684669/a-bloomberg-terminal-for-mastodon.html">Bloomberg terminal</a> for Mastodon!” As those of us who rode the first wave of the blogosphere will recall, RSS readers were a revelation for the same reason.</p>
<p>
Second, I find that the absence of images and styled text has a <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3686515/images-considered-harmful-sometimes.html">calming effect</a>. To maintain a healthy information diet you need to choose sources wisely but, no matter where you go, sites deploy a barrage of attention-grabbing devices. I find dialing down the noise helpful, for the same reason that I often switch my phone to monochrome mode. Attention is our scarcest resource; the fewer distractions, the better.</p>
<p>
There’s a tradeoff, of course; sometimes an image is the entire point of a post. So while I often read Mastodon using these Steampipe dashboards, I also use Elk directly. The Steampipe dashboards work alongside conventional Mastodon clients, and indeed depend on them: I click through from the dashboards to Elk in order to boost, reply, or view images. That experience is enhanced by <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3686115/instance-qualified-mastodon-urls.html">instance-qualified URLS</a> that translate foreign URLs to ones that work on your home server.</p>
 Manage people and lists 
<p>
The ability to assign people to lists, and read in a list-oriented way, is a handy Twitter affordance that I never used much because it was easy to let the algorithms govern my information diet. Because Mastodon doesn’t work like that, lists have become the primary way I read the fediverse flow. Of the 800+ people I follow so far, I’ve assigned more than half to lists with titles like *Climate* and *Energy* and *Software*. To help me do that, several dashboards report how many of the people I follow are assigned to lists (or not).</p>
<p>
I want as many people on lists as possible. So I periodically review the people I follow, put unassigned people on lists, and track the ratio of people who are, or aren’t, on lists. Here’s the <a href="https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/mastodon/tables/mastodon_list_account#count-how-many-of-the-accounts-i-follow-are-assigned-and-not-assigned-to-lists">query</a> for that.</p>
 with list_account as (
  select
    a.id,
    l.title as list
  from
    mastodon_my_list l
    join mastodon_list_account a on l.id = a.list_id
),
list_account_follows as (
  select
    list
  from
    mastodon_my_following
    left join list_account using (id)
)
select 'follows listed' as label, count(*) from list_account_follows where list is not null
union
select 'follows unlisted' as label, count(*) from list_account_follows where list is null
 
<p>
When you read in a list-oriented away, as is also true when you read by following hashtags, there are always people whose chattiness becomes a distraction. To control that I’ve implemented the following rule: show at most one original toot per person per list per day. Will I miss some things this way? Sure! But if you’ve said something that resonates with other people, I’m likely to hear about it from someone else. It’s a tradeoff that’s working well for me so far.</p>
<p>
Here’s the <a href="https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/mastodon/tables/mastodon_toot_list#get-recent-original-toots-on-a-lists-timeline-at-most-one-per-person-per-day">SQL implementation</a> of the rule.</p>
 with data as (
  select
    list_id,
    to_char(created_at, 'YYYY-MM-DD') as day,
    case
      when display_name = '' then username
      else display_name
    end as person,
    instance_qualified_url as url,
    substring(content from 1 for 200) as toot
  from
    mastodon_toot_list
  where
    list_id = '42994'
    and reblog is null -- only original posts
    and in_reply_to_account_id is null -- only original posts
  limit
    40
)
select
  distinct on (person, day) -- only one per person per day
  day,
  person,
  toot,
  url
from
  data
order by
  day desc,
  person;
 
<p>
On the home timeline’s dashboard I’ve made it optional to include or hide boosts, which can be the majority of items. On the list-reading dashboard I’ve opted to always exclude them, but the SQL idiom for doing so — select distinct on (person, day) — is simple, easy to understand, and easy to change.</p>
 Visualize relationships 
<p>
I’ve so far found three ways in which <a href="https://steampipe.io/blog/release-0-18-0">relationship graphs</a> can make Mastodon more legible. First, in <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3686528/mastodon-relationship-graphs.html">Mastodon relationship graphs</a>, I showed how to use SQL-defined <a href="https://steampipe.io/docs/reference/mod-resources/node">nodes</a> and <a href="https://steampipe.io/docs/reference/mod-resources/edge">edges</a> to show boost relationships among people and servers. In <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3688937/mapping-people-and-tags-on-mastodon.html">another article</a> I used the same tools to map relationships among people and tags. And <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3690268/visualizing-mastodon-server-moderation.html">most recently</a> I used them to explore server-to-server moderation. </p>
<p>
In all three cases the format conveys information not directly available from tabular views. Clusters of interesting people pop out, as do people who share tags. And when I graphed servers that block other servers I discovered an unexpected category: some servers that block others are themselves also blocked, like infosec.exchange in this example.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://jonudell.info/images/blocked-and-blocking.jpg"><br>
  <br>
</a></p>
<p>
The Steampipe combo of <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3648648/how-sql-can-unify-access-to-apis.html">SQL-oriented API access</a> and <a href="https://steampipe.io/blog/dashboards-as-code">dashboards as code</a> is a uniquely productive way to build relationship graphs that can unlock insights in any domain. As we’ve seen with <a href="https://steampipe.io/blog/k8s-insights">Kubernetes</a>, they can help make cloud infrastructure more legible. The Mastodon graphs suggest that the same can happen in the social networking realm. </p>
 Use RSS feeds 
<p>
When you append .rss to the URL of a Mastodon account, or tag, you produce an RSS feed like <a href="https://mastodon.social/@judell.rss">https://mastodon.social/@judell.rss</a> or <a href="https://mastodon.social/tags/steampipe.rss">https://mastodon.social/tags/steampipe.rss</a>. These feeds provide a kind of auxiliary API that includes data not otherwise available from the primary API: related tags, which appear in the feeds as RSS category elements. Steampipe really shines here thanks to the <a href="https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/rss">RSS plugin</a> which enables joins with the primary Mastodon API. This query augments items in account’s feed with tags that appear in each item.</p>
 with data as (
  select
    name,
    url || '.rss' as feed_link
  from
    mastodon_search_hashtag
  where
    query = $1,
    and name = query
  limit 
)
select
  to_char(r.published, 'YYYY-MM-DD') as published,
  d.name as tag,
  (
    select string_agg(trim(JsonString::text, '"'), ', ')
    from jsonb_array_elements(r.categories) JsonString
  ) as categories,

A similar query drives the graph discussed in <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2023/02/26/mapping-people-and-tags-on-mastodon/">Mapping people and tags on Mastodon</a>. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://jonudell.info/images/tag-graph.png"><br>
  <br>
</a></p>
<p>
In that example, surfacing the connection between a user, @themarkup, and a pair of tags, scotus and section230, was useful in two ways. First, it helped me instantly spot the item that I most wanted to read, which was buried deep in the search results. Second, it helped me discover a source that I’ll return to for guidance on similar topics. Of course I added that source to my Law list!</p>
 Own the algorithm 
<p>
Everyone who comes to Mastodon appreciates not having an adversarial algorithm control what they see in their timelines. Most of us aren’t opposed to algorithmic influence per se, though, we just don’t like the adversarial nature of it. How can we build algorithms that work with us, not against us? We’ve already seen one example: the list-reading dashboard displays just one item per list per person per day. That’s a policy that I was able to define, and easily implement, with Steampipe. And in fact I adjusted it after using it for a while. The original policy was hourly, that was too chatty, so I switched to daily by making a trivial change to the SQL query. </p>
<p>
In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2023/02/14/news-in-the-fediverse/">News in the fediverse</a> I showed another example. The Mastodon server press.coop aggregates feeds from mainstream news sources. I was happy to have those feeds, but I didn’t want to see those news items mixed in with my home timeline. Rather, I wanted to assign them to a News list and read them only when I visit that list in a news-reading mindset. The fediverse offers an opportunity to reboot the social web and gain control of our information diets. Since our diets all differ, it ought to be possible — and even easy — for anyone to turn on a rule like *news only on lists, not timelines*. Steampipe can make it so.</p>
 Steampipe as component 
<p>
When you ask people on Mastodon about these kinds of features, the response is often “Have you tried client X? It offers feature Y.” But that solution doesn’t scale. It would require massive duplication of effort for every client to implement every such policy; meanwhile, people don’t want to switch to client X just for feature Y (which might entail losing feature Z). Could policies be encapsulated and made available to any Mastodon client? It’s interesting to think about Steampipe as a <a href="https://steampipe.io/blog/steampipe-as-component">component</a> that delivers that encapsulation. A timeline built by SQL queries, and governed by SQL-defined policies, is a resource available to any app that can connect to Postgres, either locally or in Steampipe Cloud. </p>
<p>
If you’re curious about the Steampipe + Mastodon combo, install the <a href="https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/steampipe-plugin-mastodon">plugin</a>, try out the sample queries, then clone the <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-mastodon-insights">mod</a> and check out the dashboards. Do they usefully augment your Mastodon reader? What would improve them? Can you use these ingredients to invent your own customized Mastodon experience?

<p>最初は「OpenAI, ChatGPTへのイタリアからのアクセスをブロック開始」とのタイトルの記事でしたが、今後色々と動きがありそうなので、このエントリにまとめて追記していくことにします。ですので、随時時間付きでアップデートしていきます。</p>



 



<p>2023-04-03 13:49</p>



 OpenAI, ChatGPTへのイタリアからのアクセスをブロック開始 



<p>先日の命令<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/04/5254/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-5254" title="<a href=&quot;https://www.sakimura.org/2023/04/5220/&quot; data-type=&quot;URL&quot; data-id=&quot;https://www.sakimura.org/2023/04/5220/&quot;>「伊プライバシー当局、ChatGPTにイタリアのユーザの情報の取扱いの即時制限を命令」</a>">1</a>）をうけて、欧州で月曜日がスタートする前に、OpenAI社はChatGPTへのイタリアからのアクセスをブロック開始<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/04/5254/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-5254" title="Gigazine: OpenAIがイタリアからのChatGPTへのアクセスをブロック &amp;lt;<a href=&quot;https://gigazine.net/news/20230403-openai-geoblocks-chatgpt-italy/&quot;>https://gigazine.net/news/20230403-openai-geoblocks-chatgpt-italy/</a>&amp;gt;">2</a>したようです。</p>



<p>感想：そりゃそうですよねぇ。事実は明らかであり、命令に従わないと、EU Rep が３ヶ月間以上の禁錮ですから。</p>



 イタリアの大臣が「ChatGPTへのBanは過剰である」との発言 



<p>イタリアの大臣が「ChatGPTへのBanは過剰である」との発言もしたようです<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/04/5254/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-5254" title="Reuiter:&amp;#8221;Italian minister says country&amp;#8217;s ban on ChatGPT is excessive&amp;#8221; &amp;lt;<a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/technology/italian-minister-says-countrys-ban-chatgpt-is-excessive-2023-04-02/&quot;>https://www.reuters.com/technology/italian-minister-says-countrys-ban-chatgpt-is-excessive-2023-04-02/</a>&amp;gt;">3</a>。</p>



<p>感想：大臣が何か言ったからと言って態度を変えると独立性を問われるので、それはそれで個人情報保護当局としてはムズい展開ではありますね。</p>



 



<p>2023-04-03 16:30</p>



 ChatGPTが禁止されたイタリア向けに「PizzaGPT」が爆誕 



<p>ChatGPTへのブロックが始まったことを受けて、それを迂回する PizzaGPTというものが出てきたようです。</p>



 
 <a href="https://softantenna.com/blog/pizzagpt/">ChatGPTが禁止されたイタリア向けに「PizzaGPT」が爆誕</a> 



 <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35405760">PizzaGPT – ChatGPT clone accessible from Italy</a> 
 



<p>「Nuxt 3、Tailwind、DaisyUIを使用し、OpenAI completions APIのラッパー/チャットインターフェイスを実装したもの」とのことです。</p>



<p>感想：これでは残念ながら抜け穴にしかなってないようにおもわれます。アクセスが増えるのをさばくためにPizza１枚分のお金を寄付してほしいということのようですが、まぁ、OpenAIが年齢認証やデータ利用オプトアウトをメインの動線に入れるなど、今回指示されたことを実装するまでのつなぎだけをやる一時的システムだからそれで、ということかもしれません。独自に年齢認証やります、自動でデータ利用オプトアウトします、というのなら面白いですけどね。もちろんそれだけでは、トレーニングデータにイタリア人のデータが含まれていた問題は解決しないわけですが、少なくとも新規の学習はされなくなるなどの効果があり、多分そのあたりがGarante<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/04/5254/#easy-footnote-bottom-4-5254" title="イタリアの個人情報保護当局">4</a>とOpenAI社の落とし所になるんじゃないかなぁとは思うのですが（←単なる個人の感想です）。</p>



 



<p>2023-04-05 22:23</p>

 Since Elon’s acquisition of Twitter, the “Fediverse” has become a thing. A thing that
many people talk about, often in nebolous terms. I think we need to be more precise,
and to do that, it might be helpful to distinguish several parts of the Fediverse. 
 I believe the primary components of the Fediverse are the following, best shown
as a layered architecture: 
 
 
  
   
     People  
      You

<p>Since Elon’s acquisition of Twitter, the “Fediverse” has become a thing. A thing that
many people talk about, often in nebolous terms. I think we need to be more precise,
and to do that, it might be helpful to distinguish several parts of the Fediverse.</p>
<p>I believe the primary components of the Fediverse are the following, best shown
as a layered architecture:</p>
 
 
  
   
    <p>People</p><p>
    </p><p>You and me; sometimes companies</p>
   
  
  
   
    <p>Apps</p>
    <p>e.g. Mastodon, PeerTube</p>
   
  
  
   
    <p>Network</p>
    <p>ActivityPub (and related protocols)</p>
   
  
 
 
<p>To summarize this diagram: there is a communications network (at the bottom), over which
apps can communicate with each other (middle), enabling people to interact with each other
in various ways (top).</p>
<p>Have you noticed that when people talk about the Fediverse …</p>
 
 … sometimes they mean the network, as in: “all these apps can talk to each other because
it’s all ActivityPub” … 
 … and sometimes they mean people, as in: “We have genuine relationships with each other
in the Fediverse because no 3rd party inserts ads and addictive algorithms”? 
 And of course, when they use “Mastodon” as the term instead of “Fediverse”, that’s
because in this view, the Fediverse is primary formed by thousands of app
instances, most of which today are Mastodon instances. 
 
<p>This distinction is very important, because the properties of the “Fediverse” in the
various definitions, are quite different. For example:</p>
 
 
<p>If I think the Fediverse is all about people, and how they relate to each other,
I don’t really care whether it’s based on ActivityPub, or other protocols (like
SSB, or Bluesky, or Webmention, or …) or any combination. In this view, the Fediverse
is a “place” where certain social norms are different, including that certain behaviors
prevalent in society or in other social networks (like expressions of racism) are
frowned upon or grounds for blocking.</p>
 
 
<p>If I think the Fediverse is the set of all software nodes that communicate over ActivityPub,
then I’m baffled why anybody should think some of those nodes shouldn’t be bots,
or publish advertisements or special offers; ActivityPub can carry all of those and
more. In this view, in its extreme form, the Fediverse could ultimately encompass
a lot of internet communication infrastructure, including replacing SMTP for
“e-mail”, for example.</p>
 
 
<p>Because of this confusion, sometimes the term “Fediverse” is actually less than helpful.
On the other hand, there isn’t an obviously better term (or several; we need several).</p>
<p>In my personal view, the network/interop-centric definition of Fediverse is more useful: the
Fediverse is the set of all nodes that can communicate semantically with each other through
common protocols (ActivityPub).</p>
<p>Given this, it allows many new apps to be built that
connect to the same network – the Fediverse – creating lots of new value, as I
<a href="https://reb00ted.org/tech/20230322-open-networks-are-more-valuable-fediverse/">described earlier</a>.</p>
<p>And those in turn enable people with common values to find each other, and form communities,
that practice forms of interaction that would be much harder on centralized social media
platforms. To use but one example, my primary Fediverse account is hosted
by <a href="https://social.coop/">social.coop</a>, a member-owned cooperative that formed for the
purpose of hosting a social media server that works for them; self-funded, self-governed.
Imagine that outside of the Fediverse!</p>
<p>But regardless of what the term “Fediverse” is ultimately going to end up meaning,
whether that’s my preference or some other interpretation, let’s not conflate these different
ideas, otherwise all the beautiful opportunities created by the Fediverse to communicate
with each other won’t help us avoid talking past each other about the very thing that
makes it possible to talk!</p>

  It is time for USG to actively deploy shared identity services in the public interest

<p>The U.S. Federal Government has spent a considerable amount of time, treasure and energy admiring the problem of shared digital identity infrastructure that can be used by individuals in a privacy respecting manner, while improving cybersecurity and streamlining access to online services and benefits. It is time for it to occupy the room it owns instead of outsourcing solutions to private sector entities who do not have the public interest at heart.</p>

<p></p>



<p>The above graphic provides an easy to understand conceptual breakdown of the various components that make up a shared digital identity infrastructure.</p>

<p>I’ve updated some of the terminology to this decade, but the components and their relationships are taken directly from the U.S. Federal Identity, Credential and Access Management <a href="https://blog.aniljohn.com/2013/12/ficam-tfs-component-identity-services.html" title="FICAM TFS Component Identity Services Terminology">(FICAM) Program’s Trust Framework Solutions (TFS) Component Identity Terminology</a> circa 2013.</p>

<p>Using the TFS terminology that provides separation of concerns and capabilities, the question now becomes who within the U.S. Federal Government is best able to manage and operate these services?</p>

 GSA’s Login.gov as the Authentication Provider 

<p>In the aftermath of the GSA IG report that <a href="https://www.gsaig.gov/content/gsa-misled-customers-logingovs-compliance-digital-identity-standards" title="GSA Misled Customers on Login.gov’s Compliance with Digital Identity Standards">“GSA Misled Customers on Login.gov’s Compliance with Digital Identity Standards”</a>, and as I fully expected, there are a set of private sector identity service providers and their champions who have come out with variations of the narrative that “.gov should not be trusted to run a shared identity service” and should instead use their services, or that the “money that is allocated to Login.gov should be taken away” and re-programmed for other uses.</p>

<p>I am, oddly enough, here to make a case for why continued investment in and expansion of the Login.gov program is in the public interest. Odd because, I am on record as being Not-a-Fan of Login.gov’s remote identity proofing implementation because it was and is using data-broker transactional data instead of anything authoritative, and because of their weasel-worded support for NIST 800-63-3 Identity Assurance Levels (IALs).</p>

<p>My perspective on the GSA IG report is that it is a clear demonstration of exactly why .gov should run these types of services — because it demonstrates the independent checks and balances set up within Agencies working … and working well.</p>

<p>Can anyone point me to an example in the private sector where an Organization self-identified the problem, and corrected it with this high degree of transparency and accountability?</p>

<p>So let me stay on brand by noting that it is directly within the competency and capability of GSA and Login.gov to focus on Authentication (AAL) and Federation (FAL) Assurance Level’s and get out of the Identity Assurance Level (IAL) business.</p>

<p>In the near term, the conceptual picture of this could look something like this:</p>

<p></p>

<p>The Agency remains responsible for the remote identity proofing and can use its internal data or other data sources it has access to, in order to accomplish it, but its use of Login.gov as the Authentication provider eases the burdens that are placed on individuals interacting with the Agency’s services, which should be a priority of any Agency!</p>

<p>I am semi-amused to note that this would enable us to catch up, after many long years, <a href="https://blog.aniljohn.com/2014/10/c2g-identity-services-overview-canada.html" title="A C2G Identity Services Overview of Canada">to what the Canadian Federal Government have effectively been doing at population scale for a LONG time!</a></p>

<p>However, this is only the first step, as it is just as important to implement a shared identity validation service that can be utilized by Agencies to mitigate account opening fraud, benefits fraud, and synthetic identity fraud.</p>

 Say No to Match/No-Match 

<p>While supporting the intent of such services, I also believe that it is a <a href="https://www.cyberforge.com/not-better-identity/" title="Not better identity">REALLY BAD IDEA to implement these validation services using a “match/no-match” or “yes/no” architecture</a> because it:</p>

 
   Implements a “phone home” capability that can be abused 
   Limits the ability to collect informed consent from an individual about the use of their data 
   Can be abused by databrokers to enhance their targeting, profiling and segmentation of individuals 
 

<p><a href="https://www.cyberforge.com/not-better-identity/" title="Not better identity">My linked article</a> goes into the details and closed with a note that with the advances in understanding of the pitfalls of the private sector ecosystem as well as progress that has been made on global technical standards that ensure interoperability, security, privacy and choice, there is another way to implement this capability that can mitigate and/or eliminate the issues noted above.</p>

 Future&nbsp;» .gov W3C VC Broker for Authoritative Data Sources 

<p>That way is to enable an individual to have agency and control in interacting with authoritative sources that contain information about them, and giving them the capability to obtain and then present that information in a trustworthy and privacy respecting manner to entities they wish to interact with.</p>

<p>This will require the implementation of a shared service W3C Verifiable Credentials Broker Service that acts as the gateway to multiple authoritative sources within the Government. The individual directly interacts with those sources in order to obtain licenses, permits, credentials and attestations that they in turn can use in any online transactions – both with the Government and with the private sector!</p>

<p>The model for this would look like this:</p>

<p></p>

<p>What is important to understand about this model is that the “.gov Shared W3C VC Broker” is not by itself an authoritative issuer, but instead is a gateway/broker/UI implementation that acts as the front-end for multiple, independent authoritative issuers of W3C Verifiable Credentials.</p>

<p>Think that is too far out there?</p>

<p>I don’t believe it is, since I can point you to the <a href="https://playground.chapi.io/issuer">multi-vendor, multi-issuer, multi-party interoperability implementation environment that is being operationally tested by the W3C Verifiable Credential and W3C Decentralized Identifier community</a> to see a working example of this model:</p>

<p></p>

<p>What you see above is a gateway/broker that is a very light-weight facade over 6 different credential issuers, that an individual can interact with in order to obtain one or more W3C Verifiable Credentials.</p>

<p>The same approach can serve as a starting point for a .gov service; for a moment, swap out the credentials shown above with credentials that could be generated from the following authoritative data sources:</p>
 
   Passport Information (State Department) 
   Immigration/Employment Eligibility Status (USCIS) 
   Tax Records (IRS) 
   Social Benefit Eligibility (SSA) 
   Birth/Death Records (State Vital Records Agency) 
   Driver Eligibility and State Residency (State DMVs) 
   Address of Record (USPS) 
   … 
 

<p>Also consider that as the individual is directly interacting with the service, receiving a credential, and then they (and not the Government) are using it (as they already do now in the paper world) for a variety of interactions that the Government may not be party to, it is not triggering .gov considerations related to Government use of that data since the Government has no visibility or awareness of the use of that data by the individual i.e. no “phone home” issues!</p>

<p>As an aside, if you were to ask me who should operate such a W3C VC Broker service for the U.S. Government, my answer would be the U.S. Postal Service, for a variety of very good reasons! <a href="https://www.usps.com/international/passports.htm">Hint: If you are a U.S. Citizen, how did you apply for the highest value citizen facing credential issued by the U.S. Federal Government?</a></p>

 Enable individuals, not databrokers! 

<p>I am not a believer or supporter of a Government issued identity card, but I do believe that Government has a role in standing behind and vouching for information it is authoritative for, when requested by an individual.</p>

<p>This architectural model provides the ability to do just that, while supporting individual agency, control and consent of the individual regarding their information, and puts digital identity within the U.S. Government on a path that can interoperate with other global jurisdictions.</p>

<p>(4月2日16時更新) 現地（ローマ）時間3月30日、イタリアの個人データ保護監督機関であるGPDP<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/04/5220/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-5220" title="Garante per la protezione dei dati personali">1</a>(通称: Garante)は、米企業OpenAI LLCが運営するChatGPTサービスに関連するイタリア在住のユーザの個人データの処理について、仮の制限措置を命じました。GPDPは、ChatGPTによって収集されたデータ主体やユーザーに情報が提供されておらず、アルゴリズムのトレーニングのための個人データの収集や処理に適切な法的根拠がないことを指摘しました。また、13歳未満の子供のためのフィルタがなく、ユーザーの個人データ、特に未成年者の個人データの処理が、EUの一般データ保護規則（GDPR）のいくつかの条項に違反していることも指摘しました。仮の制限措置は、イタリアにおけるデータ主体の個人データ全般に適用され、措置に違反した場合は刑事罰や行政罰が科されます。データ管理者は、改善のために取られた手順と、この違反行為を正当化するために有用と思われる情報を20日以内に提供するよう要請されました。</p>



<p>以上、ChatGPTによる命令112号の要約でした<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/04/5220/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-5220" title="イタリア語の原文をDeepLで英語化し、その要約を作らせて、さらに「日本語で」とお願いしました">2</a></p>



 命令の詳細 



<p>さて、では詳細に入りたいと思います。この命令112号は、前文というか、命令を正当化する部分と、命令本体の２つの部分よりなっています。</p>



 前文 



<p>前文部分では、冒頭でGDPR(2016)とイタリアの個人情報保護法(2003)と、昨今の報道に基づく命令だとわかります。そして、次に以下のことが考慮されたと記述されます。</p>



 
 ChatGPTについての多くの報道
 
 これは3月20日に発覚したデータ漏洩（バグのせいで他の人の最初の会話が見えてしまう、日曜から月曜にサービス一時停止するまでの9時間の間にアクティブであったChatGPT Plusユーザの内1.2%のユーザの支払い関連情報<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/04/5220/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-5220" title="first and last name, email address, payment address, the last four digits (only) of a credit card number, and credit card expiration date">3</a>が見えてしまうことが多く報道されたことを指していると思われます（詳細は<a href="https://openai.com/blog/march-20-chatgpt-outage">OpenAIの3月24日発表資</a>料<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/04/5220/#easy-footnote-bottom-4-5220" title="March 20 ChatGPT outage: Here’s what happened &amp;lt;<a href=&quot;https://openai.com/blog/march-20-chatgpt-outage&quot;>https://openai.com/blog/march-20-chatgpt-outage</a>&amp;gt;">4</a> 参照）） 
 
 



 本件調査によると、ユーザもしくはOpenAIによるデータ収集およびChatGPTにおける処理対象になった者に何ら情報が提供されていないこと。 



 ChatGPTのトレーニングのためにデータを収集・処理することに適法な根拠<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/04/5220/#easy-footnote-bottom-5-5220" title="GDPR第6条。(a) 特定の目的のための同意、(b) 契約の履行または契約にさきだつ手続き、(c)法的義務、(d) 生命の保護、(e) 公共の利益、(f) 正当利益（こども及びデータ対象者の利益並びに基本的な権利及び自由のほうが優先する場合を除く） ">5</a>が無いこと。 



 データ主体の個人データの処理が、ChatGPTが提供する情報が実際のデータと必ずしも一致しないことに表されるように、データ主体の個人データの処理が不正確なものであること。 



 利用規約で13歳以上のためのサービスとしているにも関わらず、年齢確認していないこと。 



 13歳未満の子供向けのフィルターが無いため、発達段階や自己認識のに比して全く不適切な回答に子供がさらされること。 
 



<p>これらに鑑みて、処理対象となった児童を含むユーザの個人情報の処理に関して、GDPRの第5条<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/04/5220/#easy-footnote-bottom-6-5220" title="個人データの取扱いと関連する基本原則">6</a>、6条<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/04/5220/#easy-footnote-bottom-7-5220" title="取扱いの適法性">7</a>、８条<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/04/5220/#easy-footnote-bottom-8-5220" title="情報社会サービスとの関係において子どもの同意に適用される要件">8</a>、１３条<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/04/5220/#easy-footnote-bottom-9-5220" title="データ主体から個人データが取得される場合において提供される情報">9</a>、２５条<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/04/5220/#easy-footnote-bottom-10-5220" title="データ保護バイデザイン及びデータ保護バイデフォルト">10</a>に違反したと認定しています。</p>



<p>このことから、GDPR第58条(2)(f)<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/04/5220/#easy-footnote-bottom-11-5220" title="取扱いの禁止を含め、一時的な制限又は恒久的な制限を課すこと">11</a>に基づき、調査が継続中ではあるものの、緊急性に鑑みて暫定的なデータの取扱い停止命令を出すとしています。対象は、13歳未満を含む全てのイタリア在住者のデータです。利用規約で13以上としているのに13歳未満も対象としているのは、年齢制限の仕組みが実装されていないからです。これは、この処分通知が到達した時点<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/04/5220/#easy-footnote-bottom-12-5220" title="要は即日">12</a>で有効となります。また、処分の内容は調査の結果によって変わる可能性があります。</p>



<p>次に、この命令に違反した場合には、禁錮3ヶ月〜2年（イタリア個人情報保護法第170条）の罰則が与えられることが述べられています。</p>



<p>また、この命令は、緊急性に鑑みて、イタリア個人情報保護委員会設置法第5条8項<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/04/5220/#easy-footnote-bottom-13-5220" title="緊急時には委員会を開催せず、委員長の独断で決定できることを規定">13</a>に基づき、委員長の決定で出されていることが述べられます。</p>



 主文 



<p>かくなる上で、個人情報保護委員会は以下の命令を通知しています。</p>



 
 a) 規則第58条2項(f)に基づき、ChatGPTを開発・運営する米国企業OpenAI L.L.C.に対して、当該アプリケーションを通じて行われる個人情報の処理のデータ管理者として、イタリア領内に存在するデータ対象者<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/04/5220/#easy-footnote-bottom-14-5220" title="degli interessati 英語で data subject">14</a>の個人情報の処理を暫定的に制限する措置を緊急に命ず。 



 b) この命令は受け取り即時に有効であり、追加措置がありうる。 
 



<p>加えて</p>



 
 GDPR第58条に基づき、データ管理者は20日以内に本違反事件にかかわるデータの取扱を正当化する主張を委員会に届けること 
 



<p>をもとめています。なお、第58条に基づく照会に違反した場合には第83条5項eに基づき行政罰を受ける可能性があることもあわせて述べています。</p>



 感想 



<p>OpenAIにとってはなかなかしんどいですね。日本のこの手のことをやっている企業にも参考になると思います。</p>



<p>まず、ユーザもしくはOpenAIによるデータ収集およびChatGPTにおける処理対象になった者に何ら情報が提供されていない点。公開されているデータにも個人情報はたくさんはいっていますし、その処理に先立ち当該個人に処理する旨の情報提供が必要だということでしょう。かなりしんどいですね。</p>



<p>次にトレーニングに関するデータの使用に適法な根拠が無いという点。</p>



<p>GDPR第6条では</p>



 
 (a) 特定の目的のための同意、 



 (b) 契約の履行または契約にさきだつ手続き、 



 (c)法的義務、 



 (d) 生命の保護、 



 (e) 公共の利益、 



 (f) 正当利益（13歳未満およびデータの対象者の処理されない利益が上回る場合を除く） 
 



<p>を適法性根拠として上げているわけですが、まず(a)。学習データとして使うことの同意はまず取れてないですから「同意」は根拠として使えなさそうです。</p>



<p>さらに(b)。そもそも学習データとして使う段階では、契約をするかどうかわからないわけですから無理です。</p>



<p>(c)(d)が無理なのは言わずもがな。(e)の公共の利益も厳しそうです。</p>



<p>最後(f)の正当利益ですが、これに関して20日以内に回答せよとまずは言っていますね。普通に考えると、13歳未満のデータが入っていないこと、データ対象者の利益を害さないことを立証しているPIAレポートが求められそうです。</p>



<p>次が「正確性の原則」違反。デタラメ返しますからね。正確性の原則は、ついデータベースなどに保管しているデータの正確性と思いがちですが、これは処理全体にかかるので、処理の結果出てくる情報にもあてはまります。</p>



<p>5と6は子どもに対する対応の無さへの指摘。規約に書くだけでは不十分であり、年齢認証がもとめられるようです。</p>



<p>そして、処理を停止しなかったら禁錮３ヶ月〜２年。とりあえずChatGPTは日本からはまだ動いているように見えるのですが、イタリアからのアクセスはできないようにとかしたのだろうか…。いや、それだけではだめで、イタリア領内のデータ対象者のデータの処理をやめなければいけないわけですが、いったいどうやって？？？モデルからその部分を取り除けるようになっているのかしら…。</p>



<p>そして主文についてですが、これはもう端的に書いてある通り。加えて、ちゃんと20日以内に申し開きを提出することができるのかが注目されますね。</p>

  <p>I have a side project called <a href="https://github.com/herestomwiththeweather/bookloggr">BookLoggr</a> which was created for the purpose of saving notes to books as I have done for decades but on the empty back pages of books.  A year ago I added a feature for uploading pdfs and found myself often just cutting and pasting interesting sentences.  I soon started saving academic papers as well as books.</p>

<p>Only recently have I begun to appreciate reading beginner books in french.  On each page, I’ll find many new words that I need to look up and annotate with the english word inside the book.  It is very time consuming and awkward to put the book down, pull up <a href="https://deepl.com/translate">deepl.com</a> and type the word into the translation form.  It is much less disruptive to be able to click a button to translate the page and I can optionally write the english word inside the physical copy of the book.</p>

<p>So, I decided to repurpose my existing interface for adding a note (which was already associated with a page number) to make the note the entire contents of a page.  Now, before I start reading the french book, I add each page of the book as a note.  Last night, I wrote <a href="https://github.com/herestomwiththeweather/bookloggr/commit/cb728b0f0552a84303e70d107f62eb95ecb226b0">the code</a> to allow clicking a button to translate a page of french text using DeepL.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I added the pages last night and will try it out and see how it goes…</p>

  By creating fully qualified authorization contexts from minimal requests, a PIP reduces the burden on developers building or integrating PEPs, allows for more flexible and reusable policies, and enriches authorization contexts to allow more precise access decisions.

The PDP uses a policy store and an authorization context to determine whether access should be granted or not. How much of the authorization context does the PEP have to provide to the PDP?</p>   <p>Thanks for reading Phil Windley's Technometria! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.</p>       <p>Consider the following policy1:</p><blockquote><p>Managers in marketing can approve transactions if they are not the owner and if the amount is less than their approval limit.</p></blockquote><p>A PDP might make the following fully qualified request to get an authorization decision:</p><blockquote><p>Can user username = Alice with jobtitle = manager and department = marketing do action = approve on resource of type = financial transaction with transaction id = 123 belonging to department = finance and with amount = 3452?</p></blockquote><p>This request contains all of the authorization context needed for the policy to run. A fully qualified request requires that the PEP gather all of the information about the request from various attribute sources.</p><p>Alternatively, consider this minimal request:</p><blockquote><p>Can user username = Alice do action = approve on resource with transaction id = 123?</p></blockquote><p>The minimal request reduces the work that the PEP must do, placing the burden on the PDP to build an authorization context with sufficient information to make a decision. We can separate this work out into a separate service called a policy information point (PIP). To build an authorization context for this request, the PIP must retrieve the following information:</p>  <p>The user’s job title, department, and approval limit.</p>  <p>The transaction’s owner and amount.</p>  <p>Building this context requires that the PIP have access to several attribute sources including the HR system (where information about Alice is stored) and the finance system&nbsp;&nbsp;(where information about transactions is stored).</p> Attribute Value Providers <p>PIPs are not usually the source of attributes, but rather a place where attributes are brought together to create the authorization context. As you saw, the PIP might query the HR and Finance systems, using attributes in the request to create fully qualified authorization context. Other examples of attribute value providers (AVP) include databases, LDAP directories, Restful APIs, geolocation services, and any other data source that can be correlated with the attributes in the minimal request. </p><p>What’s needed depends on the policies you’re evaluating. The fully qualified context should only include needed attributes, not every piece of information the PIP can gather about the request. To that end, the PIP must be configurable to create the context needed without wasteful queries to unneeded AVPs.</p> PEP Attributes <p>There is context that the PEP has that the PDP might need. For example, consider this request:</p><blockquote><p>Can user username = Alice do action = view on resource with transaction id = 123 from IP = 192.168.1.23 and browser = firefox?</p></blockquote><p>The PIP typically would not have access to the IP address or browser type. The PEP must pass that information along for use in evaluating the policy.</p> Derived Attributes <p>The PIP can enhance information that the PDP passes in to derive new attributes. For example, consider a policy that requires the request come from specific ranges of IP addresses. The first instinct a developer might have is to embed the IP range directly in the policy. However, this is a nightmare to maintain if multiple policies have the same range check—especially when the range changes. The solution is to use derived attributes, where you can define a new attribute, <code>is_ip_address_in_range</code>, and have the PIP calculate it instead. </p><p>This might be generalized with a Session Attribute component in the PIP that can enhance or transform session attributes into others that are better for policies. This is just one example of how raw attributes might be transformed to provide richer, derived attributes. Other examples include deriving an age from a birthday, an overall total for several transactions, or a unique key from other attributes.</p> Benefits of a PIP <p>While the work to gather the attributes to build the authorization context may seem like it’s the same whether the PEP or PIP does it, there are several benefits to using a PIP:</p>  <p>Simplified attribute administration—A PIP provides a place to manage integration with attribute stores that ensures the integration and interpretation are done consistently across multiple systems.</p>  <p>Reduced Complexity—PIPs can reduce the complexity of the access control system by removing the need for individual access control components to have their own policy information. PEPs are typically designed to be lightweight so they can be used close to the point where the access is enforced. For example, you might have PEPs in multiple API gateways co-located with the services they intermediate or in smartphone apps. A PIP offloads work from the PEP to keep it lightweight.</p>  <p>Separation of Concerns—PIPs separate policy information from policy decision-making, making it easier to update and modify policies and AVPs without impacting other parts of the access control system. For example, making fully qualified requests increases the coupling in the system because the PEP has to know more about policies to formulate fully qualified requests.</p>  <p>Improved Scalability— PIPs can be deployed independently of other access control components, which means that they can be scaled independently as needed to accommodate changes in policy volume or access requests.</p>  <p>Enhanced Security— PIPs can be configured to provide policy information only to authorized PDPs, which improves the security of the access control system and helps to prevent unauthorized access. In addition, a PIP builds consistent authorization contexts whereas different PEPs might make mistakes or differ in their output. </p>   Tradeoffs <p>There are tradeoffs with using a PIP. For example, suppose that the PEP is embedded in the ERP system and has local access to both the HR and financial data. It might more easily and cheaply use those attributes to create a fully qualified request. Making a minimal request and requiring the PIP to make a call back to the ERP for the data to create the authorization context would be slower.</p><p>But, as noted above, this solution increases the coupling between the PEP and PDP because the PEP now has to have more knowledge of the policies to make the fully qualified request. Developers need to use their judgement about request formulation to evaluate the tradeoffs.</p> Conclusion <p>By creating fully qualified authorization contexts from minimal requests, a PIP reduces the burden on developers building or integrating PEPs, allows for more flexible and reusable policies, and enriches authorization contexts to allow more precise access decisions.</p>    Notes   <p>The information in this article was inspired by <a href="https://axiomatics.com/blog/7-should-the-policy-enforcement-point-send-all-attributes-needed-to-evaluate-a-request">Should the Policy Enforcement Point Send All Attributes Needed to Evaluate a Request</a>? </p>  <p>Photo Credit: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/185524011@N04/49070117146">Information Desk Charleston Airport</a> from AutoRentals.com (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC BY 2.0</a>, photo is cropped from original)</p>   <p>Thanks for reading Phil Windley's Technometria!

recently. Sorry if this is a bit cryptic, it was written for a very specific technical
audience. I have added a few annotations in square brackets to provide context.</p>
<p>What am I missing in my wish list?</p>
 
<p>Putting on my product developer hat, here’s what I want for Christmas:</p>
 A single-document basic [Fediverse] interop spec, ie. 
 
 when I have written code for everything it says, my code will interoperate in some basic fashion with all other software that has implemented this document 
 no need to consult or understand other implementations 
 may be quite basic, e.g. text content only, only a minimal set of activity types 
 enables implementors to have a “MVP”-style interop at lowest-possible engineering effort (including the time required to read/understand the specs!) 
 This could be done as a “minimal profile” of a stack that contains a subset of AP [ActivityPub], AS [ActivityStreams], and Webfinger 
 
 A test suite for that profile 
 
 suitable to add to my automated test suite 
 over time, this test suite can grow beyond the minimal profile 
 
 A branding program for products that have passed the test suite 
 
 As an implementor, you get to put the sticker on your product. 
 In particular, in the places in the product where users “connect” to other servers in the Fediverse, like “Visa” is displayed at the POS terminal 
 I believe this will become critical if/when larger orgs with potentially different value systems connect to the Fediverse 
 
 A set of web “intent buttons” for Like, Follow, Post, etc that work across sites 
 
 like they exist for centralized social media 
 as easy to use for the user 
 we can argue how this can be accomplished technically. I have opinions, but for this wish list, they are immaterial, as long as I get those buttons :-) 
 
 A standardized way to express terms under which content is provided 
 
 As I understand it, Bob Wyman calls that a Rights Expression Language 
 This probably should start with a use case collection 
 
 A design for search that meets the requirements of all relevant parties and points of view 
 
 This is probably far less a technical problem than one of successful communication 
 
 A design to reduce certain loads 
 
 Fan-out 
 Video 
 (Not my area of expertise, so I don’t have details) 
 
 Improved identity management across the Fediverse 
 
 Easy-to-use single-sign-on across servers. Use case: I use several apps for different content types (like micro blog and video). Bonus: they all post from the same identifier 
 Easy-to-use persona management. Use case: I have a personal and a work account, bonus if they can be on the same server 
 Identifiers not tied to the domain name system 
 
<p>Some of this squarely falls in the domain of this group [that would be the W3C’s Social Web Interest Community Group], some is adjacent. It could be pulled in, or it can be done somewhere else. I don’t particularly care about that either, as long as it gets done and done consistently with the rest.</p>
<p>Now I’m sure you all are going to tell me why I can’t have all those things for Christmas, and certainly not this Christmas. But I can wish, no? (More seriously, I think they are all essential for continued successful growth of the ActivityPub network as new parties connect)</p>

Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.</p>       <p>I was at <a href="https://devopsdays.org/events/2023-salt-lake-city/welcome/">SLC DevOpsDays</a> last week and attended a talk by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharon-goldberg-002803143/">Sharon Goldberg</a> on MFA in 2023. She's a security expert and focused many of her remarks on the relative security of different multi-factor authentication (MFA) techniques, a topic I cover in my book as well. I liked how she described the security provisions of passkeys (also know as Fast ID Online or FIDO).</p><p>FIDO is a challenge-response protocol that uses public-key cryptography. Rather than using certificates, it manages keys automatically and beneath the covers, so it’s as user-friendly as possible. I’m going to discuss the latest FIDO specification, FIDO2, here, but the older FIDO U2F and UAF protocols are still in use as well.</p><p>FIDO uses an authenticator to create, store, and use authentication keys. Authenticators come in several types. Platform authenticators are devices that a person already owns, like a laptop or smartphone. Roaming authenticators take the form of a security key that connects to the laptop or smartphone using USB, NFC, or Bluetooth.</p><p>This is a good time for you to stop reading this and head over to <a href="https://www.passkeys.io/">Passkeys.io</a> and try them for yourself. If you're using a relatively modern OS on your smartphone, tablet, or computer, you shouldn't have to download anything. Sign up using your email (it doesn't have to be a real email address), do whatever your device asks when you click "Save a Passkey" (on my iPhone it does Face ID, on my MacOS laptop, it does Touch ID). Then sign out.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49a6a097-8e65-4eb3-8300-e0526c8ba8e4_2350x1624.png">    </a>Using Touch ID with Passkey <p>Now, click on "Sign in with a passkey". Your computer will let you pick an identifier (email address) that you've used on that site and then present you with a way to locally authenticate (i.e., on the device). It's that simple. In fact, my biggest fear with passkeys is that it's so slick people won't think anything has happened.</p><p>Here's what's going on behind the scenes: When Alice registers with an online service like Passkeys.io, her authenticator (software on her phone, for example) creates a new cryptographic key pair, securely storing the private key locally and registering the public key with the service. The online service may accept different authenticators, allowing Alice to select which one to use. Alice unlocks the authenticator using a PIN, fingerprint reader, or face ID.</p><p>When Alice authenticates, she uses a client such as a browser or app to access a service like a website (see figure below). The service presents a login challenge, including the chance to select an account identifier, which the client (e.g., browser) passes to the authenticator. The authenticator prompts Alice to unlock it and uses the account identifier in the challenge to select the correct private key and sign the challenge. Alice’s client sends the signed challenge to the service, which uses the public key it stored during registration to verify the signature and authenticate Alice.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc5422e81-9975-49fe-b853-e16c676d1684_427x257.png">    </a>Authenticating with Passkey <p>FIDO2 uses two standards. The <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-v2.0-id-20180227/fido-client-to-authenticator-protocol-v2.0-id-20180227.html">Client to Authenticator Protocol (CTAP)</a> describes how a browser or operating system establishes a connection to a FIDO authenticator. The <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2-2/fido2-web-authentication-webauthn/">WebAuthN protocol</a> is built into browsers and provides an API that JavaScript from a Web service can use to register a FIDO key, send a challenge to the authenticator, and receive a response to the challenge.</p><p>One of the things I liked about Dr. Goldberg's talk is that she emphasized that the security of passkeys rests on three things:</p>  <p>Transport Layer Security (TLS) to securely transport challenges and responses.</p>  <p>The WebAuthN protocol that gives websites a way to invoke the local authentication machinery using a Javascript API.</p>  <p>A secure, local connection between the client and authenticator using CTAP.</p>  <p>One of the weaknesses of how we use TLS today is that people don't usually check the lock icon in the browser and don't understand domain names enough to tell if they're being phished. Passkeys do this for you. The browser unambiguously transfers the domain name to the authenticator which knows if it has an established relationship with that domain or not. Authenticating that you're on the right site is a key reason they're so much more secure than other MFA alternatives. Another is having a secure channel from authenticator to service, making phishing nearly impossible because there's no way to break into the authentication flow.</p><p>Passkeys provide a secure and convenient way to authenticate users without resorting to passwords, SMS codes, or TOTP authenticator applications. Modern computers and smartphones and most mainstream browsers understand FIDO protocols natively. While roaming authenticators (hardware keys) are available, for most use cases, platform authenticators (like the ones built into your smartphone or laptop) are sufficient. This makes FIDO an easy, inexpensive way for people to authenticate. As I said, the biggest impediment to its widespread use may be that people won’t believe something so easy is secure.</p><p></p>   <p>Thanks for reading Phil Windley's Technometria!

  Overview <br><p>Balance is a necessity in every aspect of life.&nbsp; Knowing if we are in or out of balance directly affects our ability to survive and thrive; therefore, this thought piece brings something new to understanding balance and by association purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Adaptation and homeostasis are the natural world's way of creating an unstable equilibrium. This dynamic system is unpacked and repurposed to present a solid argument for leadership teams and boards of directors to shift questions to ones that understand how to balance two powerful opposing forces.&nbsp; Balancing the development of the new whilst maintaining and preserving the existing has always been challenging, but here is a model that makes it easier.</p><p>In nature, we observe that organisms with little or no adaptation to ever-changing environments struggle to survive, whereas those that are pushing the evolutionary envelope and mutating into more suitable candidates for their ecosystem thrive. We also know that homeostasis and memory are key factors in maintaining stability. We find the same duality phenomena is reflected in the business world as we try to find a balance between creating new and maintaining what we have.&nbsp;</p><p>Nature does not favour new over old but ebbs and flows, appearing to have a fluid, ever-changing dynamic stability; however, businesses try to prioritise based on a purpose, and this piece highlights that often there is an unwillingness to consider both perspectives in balance, which is detrimental.&nbsp; What are the right questions to ask to determine if your purpose or strategy will disrupt fragile balances or if you are aligned and can thrive?&nbsp;</p><p>This is a 20-minute read which will challenge your perceptions and presuppositions of the role you inhabit and the role your ecosystem plays on you.</p><br><br><br><br><br> Can you, I, us, society or business have a single purpose? <br><p>In our natural world, two dependent systems keep our fragile life from ending. One is the ability to mutate and adapt, and the other is maintenance (homeostasis) and memory. When we observe the dynamic expansions and contractions in our natural world, we see the two-sides of this dynamic system competing.&nbsp; We can label these forces as “error creation” and “error correction”, and there is a never-ending ebb and flow between the two states, which creates a dynamic stability or an unbalanced equilibrium; two oxymorons which we will explore below. The ability to see both sides of a perspective gives us a wider vantage point that can help us unlock powerful insights into why a single unified purpose is not feasible, why AI will not take over, and how to avoid failure in times of uncertainty.</p> Is believing in a unified purpose a protective delusion?&nbsp; <p>The theory of evolution is a scientific explanation for how life on Earth has changed over time and how different species have arisen from common ancestors. It is based on the idea that all living things share a common ancestry and that the diversity of life we see today results from gradual changes over millions of years through a process called natural selection. Natural selection is the process by which certain traits become more or less common in a population based on their effects on survival and reproduction. Random mutation being the way to create new traits and adaptation, are central to the theory of evolution.</p><p>Homeostasis is maintenance, it refers to the ability of an organism to maintain a stable internal environment despite changes in the external environment. It is essential for the survival and well-being of an organism, and disruptions to this balance can have serious consequences. Memory refers to the process of storing, retaining, and retrieving information both individually and at a societal level; consider here how history, culture, law and even paintings and architecture are memory. Memory gives an organism the ability to maintain a sense of stability despite being in a changing environment, as one is able to recall the expected outcome of a familiar circumstance.&nbsp; Homeostasis and memory are critical for stability and survival.&nbsp;</p><p>These concepts, mutation &amp; adaptation and homeostasis &amp; memory, have been observed for thousands of years, and as humans unpack the complex connectivity between them, we can better articulate what we observe, which is why it can be so difficult to find and follow a singular goal to its completion. The connection between them has elements of both immediacy and delay: mutation demands an immediate response from homeostasis, yet also drives changes over time through immunity responses"; In the long run, human changes create environments for different mutations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>To the observer who notices that there are no arrows, there is a reason for that. It is about the connection, relationship, and coupling, not the directionality of flow.&nbsp;</p><p>Life is often framed as a competitive arms race: the survival of the fittest between living organisms that adapt to a constantly variable, but ultimately stable system. Mutations are randomness in the complex life coding system that creates new traits.&nbsp; Mutations can create an advantage in the arms race as they can lead to unique traits which make an organism fitter for its environment.&nbsp; Advantageous traits tend to thrive, whereas non-advantageous traits will either cease to exist or live on at a subsistence level.</p><p>Cyber security is positioned as a similar modern-day example of an arms race, but in reality, it is one system (virus) that is looking for a vulnerability to give it an advantage, and the other system running anti-virus is responding/ adapting to prevent it. The virus can only be created because the system has a fundamental flaw (weakness), and it is a race between those who want to uncover it and those who want to hide it, but the flaw exists. It is not the same.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>One could use the free market economy as a modern example of this phenomenon of mutation and homeostasis, whereby we use the words “innovation” and “competition” as synonyms for “mutation” and “survival of the fittest”. To describe innovation as solely beneficial, or solely detrimental would be incorrect; likewise, it is not reasonable to suggest that stability is solely one or the other. In all aspects of life, there is a balance between chaos and order, mutation and homeostasis, and innovation and tradition. Therefore, when we re-frame our thinking, we see that believing in a single, unified purpose is a delusion, as this singular goal only represents one side of a dynamic system whereby control on one end does not create the end game, and we only have a bright future because we have two.</p> A preference for labelling <p>If I gave you a choice between “innovation” and “mutation”, which one do you associate with value, creativity and growth?</p><p>Transposing the words that describe our natural world directly into a business environment would create fear, uncertainty and doubt.&nbsp; “We are working hard on innovation” sounds more impressive and reasonable than “we are creating new mutations.”&nbsp; “We mostly operate in a competitive market” sounds so much more plausible than “it is an arms race for the survival of the fittest”.&nbsp; Words matter, and because they do, we can use words to create dynamics to be more or less willing to discuss and debate hard topics in the boardroom.&nbsp;</p><p>The next section utilises the word “error”;&nbsp; in this context, an "error" is the gap between expected and observed. I understand that many readers will want to stick with their natural framing of an error as right/ wrong, but “error” can mean:</p>  <p>a moral offence;&nbsp;</p>  <p>belief in something untrue;&nbsp;</p>  <p>the state or condition of being wrong in conduct or judgement;</p>  <p>a mistake, blunder, lapse, or slip;</p>  <p>a deviation from perception, expected, accuracy or correctness;&nbsp;</p>  <p>the difference between the observed and actual</p>  <p>Error in this work is closer to the framing of the lower three bullets than the top three.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> How does a system based on “error creation” and “error correction” sound?&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>The dynamic of our natural world system is that one system is creating something new and different whilst the other is trying to correct and mitigate the change. One is bringing in the new, and the other defending the existing.&nbsp; One is the hope of something better, whilst the other is happy not to take the risk and maintain the same. Both sides create risk; strangely, different risks are created by each side, but nevertheless, risk.&nbsp; Error creation, in this instance, is invention, innovation and creativity.&nbsp; Error correction is stability and familiar processes that we know (and trust) from historical experience.&nbsp; The risk in the former is change, and the risk in the latter is to become not relevant.&nbsp; They are different risks.</p><p>The risk in the former is change, and the risk in the latter is to become not relevant.&nbsp; They are different risks.</p><p></p><p>How often do we translate the message we receive from leadership that we need to be both “more innovative” whilst simultaneously “improving efficiency and effectiveness” as a demand to compromise on everything and lack focus? Perhaps we should see this balance as the maintenance of an equilibrium of "error creation" and "error correction" because it creates something new that we label as value.&nbsp;</p><p>Leadership that fails to recognise there is a need for balance will fail; we first need to determine where we are in the system and which system we favour; from there, it should be easier to determine what journey we are on and where the north star is.&nbsp;</p><p>This is not “trial and error”, as before a trial, there has to be a hypothesis, and the error is a deviation in the results from the expected/ predicted.&nbsp; It is neither “error and trial”, where an error is created without a hypothesis and using some measure, one tries to determine if the error was successful. Then there is AB testing. However, these are all controlled point methods and are not about dynamic reactive complex systems.&nbsp;</p> The answer to the universe, world and everything (#douglasadams) <p>To fans of The HitchHickers Guide to the Universe, we know the answer is 42, but the question remains;&nbsp; we just needed another 5 minutes!&nbsp; My struggle with the answer, as given, was whether it was relevant when the question was asked or given since 7.5 million years passed, and a lot happens in big time frames. I would have loved to have asked Douglas.</p><p>So often, there is a dynamic between two competing ideas, both trying to be the more important single unifying idea or purpose.&nbsp; Humans want to be both heard and belong.&nbsp; It is not that one is better than the other, but one is more error creation (listen to my new idea) and one more error correction (stability of belonging).&nbsp; Some business leaders will say their purpose is “shareholder primacy”, whilst others say their core purpose is to “improve the lives of their customer”. This is a nonexclusive club - and there are many others - however, most companies settle on a purpose that is a compromise. It is safe to say that business purpose varies depending on the specific goals and values of the company and its stakeholders.&nbsp; It could be argued that the purpose of a business is to balance creating more value for the majority of the customers, shareholders, employees, and wider society as a whole than the destruction or erosion of value for others.&nbsp; Purpose itself is achieved through various competing ideas, such as developing innovative products or services, providing high-quality customer service, maintaining ethical business practices, and contributing to the ecosystem the organisation operates in.&nbsp;</p><p>When we reflect on this concept, we see that a business is itself demanding that it “creates errors” and “correct errors.” Remember, this is not “mistakes” or moral pearls; this is seeing innovation as creating change, which is an error to the system of no change. Businesses need to create new ideas and innovations but also correct errors that try to change the stability of process efficiency.&nbsp; Leadership needs to craft a level of instability whilst maintaining equilibrium.&nbsp; Note: another framing of “error” could be morally unethical behaviour and trading without reason whilst insolvent. These activities are not errors; they are illegal, and it is not what we are focused on.</p><p>Leadership needs to craft a level of instability whilst maintaining equilibrium.</p><p>Perhaps we should accept that there cannot be one single unifying purpose, and we exist in a place where some individuals, leaders, and teams favour change (error creation) and some stability (error correction), but without both, we would lose our ever-changing dynamic stability.</p> The Purpose and origin of Innovation (as an example of error creation) <p>Innovation refers to the process of creating something new or improving upon an existing product, service, or process. The purpose of innovation is to bring about positive change and to solve problems more effectively or efficiently. Innovations can be incremental or disruptive, with the latter representing a significant shift in how things are done.</p><p>The origin of innovation can be traced back to human curiosity and the desire to improve the quality of life. Throughout history, humans have constantly sought ways to improve their lives, whether it be through inventions such as the wheel or electricity, or the development of new technologies like mobile phones and the web. Innovation has played a vital role in driving progress and advancing society.</p><p>Innovation has become increasingly important as businesses seek to stay competitive and meet the changing needs of consumers. Companies invest in research and development to create new products and services to improve efficiency, increase profits, and create new market opportunities. Governments also encourage innovation through funding research and development, providing incentives for businesses, and fostering collaboration between industry and academia.</p><p>Overall, the purpose and origin of innovation are rooted in human ingenuity and the desire to create something new and better. Innovation has been and will continue to be a critical driver of progress and growth in all aspects of society, including how we achieve sustainability.&nbsp;</p><p>We like innovation as long it is not called error creation or mutation, but the reality is, no matter how hard we try, they are one and the same. &nbsp; If you naturally align with an error correction ontology, you may have a creative mindset and enjoy the process of disruption, change, and the outcomes of instability.</p><p>There are exceptions: fraud, bribery and corruption.</p> The Purpose and origin of Accounting (as an example of error correction) <p>The origins of accounting can be traced back thousands of years to ancient civilisations such as the Babylonians, who kept records of their transactions on clay tablets. In medieval Europe, accounting was used primarily by merchants and bankers to keep track of their financial transactions. The original purpose of business accounting was to provide shareholders with accurate and timely information about the financial performance and position of an organisation.</p><p>Accounting is a system of recording, analysing and summarising financial transactions to prevent errors, provide accuracy, and present information that is useful in making business decisions. Over time, accounting has evolved into a sophisticated discipline with its own set of principles and standards. In addition to serving the needs of businesses, accounting also serves the broader needs of society. For example, accounting information is used by governments to track tax revenues and by investors to make investment decisions. Accounting also plays an important role in maintaining the integrity of financial markets by providing reliable information about the financial performance of companies.</p><p>We may naturally align to the framing of finance as long it is not called error correction, doing the same, preventing change and improving stability, but the reality is, no matter how hard we try, they are one and the same. If you naturally align with an error correction ontology, you may have a more accounting mindset, whereby you will naturally look for order amidst chaos and create stable processes out of a loose set of desires.</p><p>There are exceptions: fraud, bribery and corruption.</p> How do other business functions align? <p>Marketing, sales, and product development appear to tend towards error creation, with operations, legal, and accounting systems tending towards error correction.&nbsp; It is possible that where technology and HR sits is critical to the overall balancing culture of the company and if the company favours error creation (creative, imaginative, innovative) or error correction (stable, historical, and dutiful.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The descriptions above used “tend towards.” The basic function of accounting is to remove errors, but it also has to improve continually because of the necessity of continually correcting new errors. &nbsp; The basic function of marketing is creativity, never repeating campaigns and coming up with new and different ideas. But if marketing were only creative, it would not be able to align and build upon what is already there and how the market behaves.&nbsp; Creative flair for error creation is tempered by the history and context of error correction.&nbsp; All functions demand both, and we need to understand how the balance is created by the purpose, function, and culture of the team.&nbsp;</p><p>Teams define culture.&nbsp; Teams are made of individuals who are either going to be more aligned to error-creating or error-correcting. Whilst we prefer to label individuals as&nbsp; “creative” or “checklist,” these do describe the characteristics, leadership attitudes, and biases that are critical to determining what function a department actually fulfils.&nbsp; These balances are not simple; indeed, they are complex.</p><p>Creative flair for error creation is tempered by the history and context of error correction.</p><p></p><p>A board needs to comprehend, appreciate, and understand if the balance is right. If a board is not diverse in thought, skill, and discipline, that balance may not be found or is easily lost, and the culture of one or the other can lead a business to failure, especially with an overly dominant financial focus as accounting tends to focus on being financially risk-averse. &nbsp;It is worth noting that balance, in this sense, is not about equality; the balance creates enough errors to improve continually (agile) but with enough error correction to be resilient.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The balance must create enough errors to improve continually (agile) but with enough error correction to be resilient.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Wider perspective <p></p><br><p>The error creation/correction model can scale to other forms of thinking:&nbsp;</p>  <p>Fear can be seen as error creation, whereas trust is error correction.&nbsp; There is undoubtedly a complex relationship between fear and trust that is both immediate and develops over time.&nbsp; Trust can correct fear that is related to an error originating from the past, but trust can also create a new path.&nbsp;</p>  <p>The concept of 'self' is error-creation, whereby we tend to express our individuality within a system of societal norms and memory which seeks stability and error correction.&nbsp; Individuals create eros, and their movement (many followers) creates a change which eventually becomes the new normal.</p>  <p>Freedom allows for error creation, whilst control demands correction from deviation.&nbsp; Too much freedom or too much control both appear terminal based on history. Prison and punishment systems struggle with this balance on so many levels, even using “error correction” as an idea in a different context.</p>  <p>Both error creation and error correction harbour risk, and both can be seen as creating more risk.&nbsp; Benefit&nbsp; demands an understanding of the value and cost of moving away from the known and can be seen as both more error creation (advantage) and correction (prevention).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>These examples are non-linear, and balance does not necessarily mean 50:50 and perhaps a less controversial language might be to substitute “error” with “difference.” The difference is the way in which two things, when compared, are not the same.&nbsp;</p><p>What else have you observed that represents two sides of a dynamic complex relationship, where one or both favour error creation and one error correction?&nbsp;</p><p>It is worth pondering about how and why we try to reduce the complexity of the balance into a single ROI figure in order to pass a hurdle and justify a decision.&nbsp; Can ROI ever capture consequences?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> What happens when we get it wrong? <p>Wrong, in this case, is where the balance is lost, and too many errors or too much correction ends in survival becoming unviable, with death being the only inevitable outcome. Business failure.&nbsp;</p><p>In the wild, a mutation that does not provide an advantage can easily be lost, and an overly controlled stable environment can dwindle to nothing if it fails to adapt to modernity.&nbsp;</p><p>In the economics of a business, the same is true: an innovation will not give an advantage forever, and the next innovation may not provide a new advantage. Equally, too much control and stability as a result of finance controls and regulation will result in the company becoming outdated in comparison to its environment or ecosystem - the result is the company or sector will enter a slow decline. #banking</p><p>A company does not exist on its own but in a complex ecosystem, and the balance may be achieved within the ecosystem and not just in the health or balance of a single company. In nature, the predator-prey model often forgets that the rabbit/fox needs other food and water, as well as the rabbit/fox having other threats.&nbsp; A company may well be out of balance in itself, but balance is remediated by others in the ecosystem, which is why strategy is not just about innovation, but the balance that is maintained by the ecosystem in order to create dynamic stability. It is important to understand who is moving towards stability and who is moving towards innovation; otherwise, the whole ecosystem itself can fall out of balance.</p><p>This highlights that any theory of error creation/correction must embrace relevance on at least four levels: individual, team, organisation, and ecosystem.&nbsp; A purpose may articulate what you want, but a purpose that is not dynamic in its ability to move and balance error creation and error correction at all levels is going to be short-lived.&nbsp;</p> Reframing AI away from “Intelligent Machinery.” <p>Defining the term 'artificial intelligence' presents us with a problem. The problem is that human intelligence fundamentally depends on a balanced system where error creation and error correction co-exist.&nbsp; Many of the most historic creative minds, insightful thinkers and leading scientists were neurodiverse (error-creating) and spent their lives fighting systems of error correction (academic, power, religious.)&nbsp; Flat earthers, climate deniers and Copernicus with the heliocentric model of the solar system are a few that history has thrown up.&nbsp;</p><p>Using the lens of error creation and correction, we can say that we are building ever more advanced error correction systems from big data tools, identification and removal of bias, better accounting, DNA manipulation, eradicating viruses, and using tech to provide compliance, governance, and oversight.&nbsp; In this perspective, it becomes more obvious that we do not currently focus on using ever more advanced tech to actually create errors as a route for advantage. If AI were like nature, an AI that only corrects or one that only creates errors could not survive.&nbsp;</p><p>If AI only needs to find and fix errors through the error correction lens, then AI will only be half a system and will be artificial but not intelligent. Data can be error-correcting and error-generating, but if we don't know this part of the ontology, we will never be able to gain more intelligence.&nbsp;</p><p>The diagram below expands on this thinking to suggest that there is more than just one system on the error-correcting side.&nbsp; Error correction is more complex as it needs to amend errors which are not advantageous, and promote the development of errors which are. It is equally true that the error creation side has to have a system that moderates errors, or it would be too wild, and create destruction before the opportunity arose to test if a new trait provided an advantage. The closed-loop system is full of complex feedback loops to both control and promote; with both immediacy and delay.&nbsp; What is evident is that the system is neither stable nor unstable but has pulsing oscillation, which keeps it in a delicate balance.&nbsp;</p>   The axis of thriving and death <p>What came first, the chicken or the egg?&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>In a world where error correction (driven by the desire to use experience and the past as the solid foundation) is the initiation or y-axis, and the response is error creation (creativity, invention and innovation) or x-axis, we get thinking dominated by being controlled first, and being unstable second, which creates the volatility and ambiguity that allows for dynamic stability, it is a place where we can thrive and grow. This could be our economic and political world viewed through the lens of law, policy, study, social norms, culture, and data.</p><p>In a world where error creation (driven by a desire for change, innovation, creativity, adventuring, pioneering, and invention) is the initiation, and the response is error correction (finance, risk management and control), we get instability dominating our thinking, and the environment is unbalanced, yet still in equilibrium.&nbsp; Complexity and uncertainty become leading ideas. In a place of unbalanced equilibrium, we are still able to thrive and grow. This could be our economic and political world viewed through the lens of research, hypothesis, invention, ideation, hope, and imagination.</p><p>It would appear that:&nbsp; dynamic stability + unbalanced equilibrium creates a balanced system that thrives.</p><p>What we should avoid are too much control and too much error - the question is, what do any of these worlds look or feel like, and how will we recognise them?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The last thing a fish will become aware of is water teaches us that our current environment can feel normal when in reality, it may be out of balance.&nbsp; If we cannot see or know the balance, we have lost our propensity to manage change.&nbsp;</p> Why does all this matter <p>Leadership through one lens (unbalanced equilibrium) depends on being curious, whereas leadership from the other lens (dynamic stability) demands a focus on efficiency and effectiveness, but both perspectives need to continually improve how they inform and direct decision making.&nbsp;</p><p>We often see fantastic single-idea books that encourage leadership to optimise decision-making towards growth driven by error creation (how to disrupt yourself, agile, reinvention, cross the chasm, the new normal, change management, repurpose, innovation, re-engineering); it is likely, with such a narrow focus, to lead to poor decision-making, as the benefits and outcomes for error correction are ignored or suppressed.&nbsp; This is equally true in reverse, and there are equally brilliant books that optimise for error correction (efficiency, time management, effectiveness, infinite, leadership, tick lists, ethics, merit, principles, governance, accounting, and statistics).&nbsp;</p><p>If we try to get the balance for a better outcome from both error creation and correction, we will likely get sub-optimal results for both.&nbsp; Even with all the resources in the world, nature still ebbs and flows, as it cannot optimise for both and has learnt to make compromises, but we thrive because of it.&nbsp;</p><p>The title of this long read is “Why finding purpose feels impossible”; on reflection, the title could equally have been “Why a singular unified business purpose is impossible for everyone”. If we accept we have to balance error creation and correction, a single purpose has to favour or optimise for one or the other, which means that many employees and stakeholders feel the stated “purpose” does not align with or represent them. Balance is rarely 50:50, it can come in many forms: 0:100, 80:20, 99:1, etc. Balance exists, but the context is dependent on the purpose you are trying to achieve. This is where exceptional leadership comes into its own.</p> The takeaway for leadership <p>A critically important task/ role for leadership, the board, executives, and governance are to determine:</p>  <p>If our organisation favours error-creation or error-correction</p>  <p>Where is the balance for our organisation?</p>  <p>Are we in balance? If not, are we planning to or sourcing the skills necessary to improve balance?</p>  <p>How is balance in our ecosystem achieved, what are others doing?</p>  <p>Is our organisation/ecosystem in or out of balance, and does our action change anything?</p>  <p>The most important purpose for leadership, the board, executives and governance are to understand and determine if our organisation and ecosystem are in or out of balance.&nbsp;</p><p>The problem with strategy and purpose is that we can have agreed and have an agreement, but that does not mean we agree.&nbsp; Working out balance is complex, whereas how we are performing against the plan is rather more straightforward.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>To determine and find balance, we must shift our focus from individual, singular and expert towards collective, group and ecosystem.&nbsp; Whilst the former is positioned as strong leadership, and the latter is portrayed as introducing delay, compromise, tension and conflict - it is evident that to thrive, we must know how to find and deliver balance.&nbsp;</p><br><br>

Welcome to episode 17 of the Steampipe+Mastodon series, in which we introduce a new subplot: timeline history. So far, the examples I’ve shown and discussed work with current timelines. We’ve seen SQL queries that fetch results from realtime calls to the Mastodon API, and Steampipe dashboards that display those results. But Steampipe isn’t just an API siphon, it’s also a Postgres database. As such it supports the transient tables created by Steampipe’s foreign data wrapper and plugins, but also enables you to create your own native tables as well. And you can use those native tables to accumulate data from the transient foreign tables.</p>
<p>
Because saving and searching Mastodon data is a controversial topic in the fediverse — none of us wants to recapitulate Big Social — I’ve focused thus far on queries that explore recent Mastodon flow, of which there are plenty more to write. But nobody should mind me remembering my own home timeline, so a few weeks ago I made a tool to read it hourly and add new toots to a Postgres table. </p>
<p>
Before you can add any toots to a table, of course, you’ve got to create that table. Here’s how I made this one.</p>
 create table mastodon_home_timeline as 
  select * from mastodon_toot_home limit 200
 
<p>
Once created, the table can be updated with new toots like so.</p>
 with data as (
  select
    account,
    -- more
    -- columns
    username
  from
    mastodon_toot_home
  limit 200
)
insert into mastodon_home_timeline (
  account,
    -- more
    -- columns
  username
)
select
  *
from 
  data
where 
  id not in ( select t.id from mastodon_home_timeline t )
 
<p>
To run that query from a crontab, on a machine where Steampipe is installed, save it as mastodon_home_timeline.sql, then schedule it.</p>
 15 * * * * cd /home/jon/mastodon; steampipe query mastodon_home_timeline.sql
 
<p>
That’s it! Now the number reported by select count(*) from mastodon_home_timeline is growing hourly.</p>
<p>
I’ve only been collecting toots for a couple of weeks, and haven’t yet begun to explore that data yet; we’ll see what happens when we get there. Meanwhile, though, I want to show how such exploration can be a team exercise. </p>
<p>
A friend of mine, whom I’ll call Elvis, shares my interest in teasing out connections among people, servers, and hashtags. He could capture his own timeline using the method shown here. But since we’ll be looking at this data together, we agreed that I’ll gather both our timelines. To enable that, he shared a (revokable) Mastodon API token that I’ve used to configure Steampipe with credentials for both our accounts.</p>
 connection "mastodon_social_jon" {
    plugin = "mastodon"
    server = "https://mastodon.social"
    access_token = "..."
}

connection "mastodon_social_elvis" {
    plugin = "mastodon"
    server = "https://mastodon.social"
    access_token = "..."
}
 
<p>
Steampipe’s foreign data wrapper turns each of these named connections into its own Postgres schema. Athough we happen to share the same home server, by the way, we needn’t. A team collaborating like this could pool timelines from mastodon.social and hachyderm.io and fosstodon.org and any other Mastodon-API-compatible server.</p>
<p>
(You can do the same thing with AWS or Slack or GitHub or other kind of account by defining <a href="https://steampipe.io/docs/managing/connections#querying-multiple-connections">multiple connections</a>. Steampipe makes API calls concurrently across parallel connections.)</p>
<p>
With this configuration I can read my timeline like so.</p>
 select * from mastodon_social_jon.mastodon_toot_home limit 200
 
<p>
And Elvis’ like so.</p>
 select * from mastodon_social_elvis.mastodon_toot_home limit 200
 
<p>
If I want to query both in realtime, for example to count the combined total, I can use a SQL UNION. Or I can define umbrella connection that <a href="https://steampipe.io/docs/managing/connections#using-aggregators">aggregates</a> these two.</p>
 connection "all_mastodon" {
    plugin = "mastodon"
    type = "aggregator"
    connections = [ "mastodon_social_jon", "mastodon_social_elvis" ]
}

connection "mastodon_social_jon" {
    plugin = "mastodon"
    server = "https://mastodon.social"
    access_token = "..."
}

connection "mastodon_social_elvis" {
    plugin = "mastodon"
    server = "https://mastodon.social"
    access_token = "..."
}
 
<p>
Now the query select * from all_mastodon.mastodon_toot_home limit 200 makes API calls on behalf of both accounts — in parallel — and combines the results. When we follow the resulting URLs in order to reply or boost, we’ll do so as individual identities. And we’ll be able to use Steampipe queries and dashboards in that same single-user mode. But we’ll also be able to pool our timelines and point our queries and dashboards at the combined history. </p>
<p>
Will that prove interesting? Useful? That remains to be seen. I think it’s one of many experiments worth trying as the fediverse sorts itself out. And I see Steampipe as one laboratory in which to run such experiments. With SQL as the abstraction over APIs, aggregation of connections, and <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3668032/visualizing-the-hacker-news-api-with-hcl-and-sql.html">dashboards as code</a>, you have all the ingredients needed to iterate rapidly, at low cost, toward shared Mastodon spaces tailored for teams or groups.</p>

Winter temperatures are often below 0°F (-18°C) and occasionally get as cold as -35°F (-37°C). We have a small baseboard heater in the pumphouse to keep things from freezing. That works pretty well, but one night last December, the temperature was -35°F and the power went out for five hours. I was in the dark, unable to know if the pumphouse was getting too cold. I determined that I needed a temperature sensor in the pumphouse that I could monitor remotely.</p>   <p>Thanks for reading Phil Windley's Technometria! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.</p>       <p>The biggest problem is that the pumphouse is not close to any structures with internet service. Wifi signals just don't make it out there. Fortunately, I've got some experience using <a href="https://lora-alliance.org/">LoraWAN</a>, a long-range (10km), low-power, wireless protocol. This use-case  seemed perfect for LoraWAN. About a year ago, I <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2022/04/easier_iot_deployments_with_lorawan_and_helium.shtml">wrote about how to use LoraWAN and a Dragino LHT65 temperature and humidity sensor</a>along with <a href="https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/overview">picos</a> to get temperature data over the Helium network.</p><p>I've installed a Helium hotspot near the pumphouse. The hotspot and internet router are both on battery backup. Helium provides a convenient console that allows you to register devices (like the LHT65) and configure flows to send the data from a device on the Helium network to some other system over HTTP. I created a pico to represent the pumphouse and routed the data from the LHT65 to a channel on that pico.</p><p>The pico does two things. First it processes the hearthbeat event that Helium sends to it, parsing out the parts I care about and raising another event so other rules can use the data. Processing the data is not simple because it's packed into a base64-encoded, 11-byte hex string. I won't bore you with the details, but it involves base64 decoding the string and splitting it into 6 hex values. Some of those a further packing data into specific bits of the 16-bit word, so binary operations are required. Those weren't built into the pico engine, so I added those libraries. If you're interested in the details of decoding, splitting, and unpacking the payload, check out the <code>receive_heartbeat </code>rule in <a href="https://github.com/windley/temperature-network/blob/main/io.picolabs.lht65.router.krl">this ruleset</a>.</p><p>Second, the <code>receive_heartbeat</code> rule raises the <code>lht65:new_readings</code> event in the pico adding all the relevant data from the LHT65 heartbeat. Any number of rules could react to that event depending on what needs to be done. For example, they could store the event, alarm on a threshold, or monitor the battery status. What I wanted to do is plot the temperature so I can watch it over time and let other members of the water group check it too. I found a nice service called <a href="https://iotplotter.com/">IoTPlotter</a> that provides a basic plotting service on any data you post to it. I created a feed for the pumphouse data and wrote a rule in my pumphouse pico to select on the <code>lht65:new_readings</code> event and <code>POST</code> the relevant data, in the right format, to IoTPlotter. Here's that rule:</p> <code>rule send_temperature_data_to_IoTPlotter {  
  select when lht65 new_readings

  pre {  
    feed_id = "367832564114515476";  
    api_key = meta:rulesetConfig{["api_key"]};  
    payload = {"data": {  
                  "device_temperature": [  
                    {"value": event:attrs{["readings", "internalTemp"]},  
                     "epoch": event:attrs{["timestamp"]}}  
                  ],  
                  "probe_temperature": [  
                    {"value": event:attrs{["readings", "probeTemp"]}, 
                     "epoch": event:attrs{["timestamp"]}}  
                  ],  
                  "humidity": [  
                    {"value": event:attrs{["readings", "humidity"]},  
                     "epoch": event:attrs{["timestamp"]}}  
                  ],  
                  "battery_voltage": [  
                    {"value": event:attrs{["readings", 
                                           "battery_voltage"]},  
                     "epoch": event:attrs{["timestamp"]}}  
                  ]}  
              };  
  }

  http:post("http://iotplotter.com/api/v2/feed/" + feed_id,  
     headers = {"api-key": api_key},  
     json = payload  
  ) setting(resp);  
}</code> <p>The rule, <code>send_temperature_data_to_IoTPlotter</code> is not very complicated. You can see that most of the work is just reformatting the data from the event attributes into the <a href="https://iotplotter.com/docs/?id=6ae07dbc091570630981c824">right structure for </a><a href="https://iotplotter.com/docs/?id=6ae07dbc091570630981c824">IoTPlotter</a>. The result is a <a href="https://iotplotter.com/user/feed/367832564114515476">set of plots</a> that looks like this:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F881da1f6-1b9f-4f14-9be9-9920b7089877_1712x1167.png">    </a> <p>Pretty slick. If you're interested in the data itself, you're seeing the internal temperature of the sensor (orange line) and temperature of an external probe (blue line). We have the temperature set pretty high as a buffer against power outages. Still, it's not using that much power because the structure is very small. Running the heater only adds about $5/month to the power bill. Pumping water is much more power intensive and is the bulk of the bill. The data is choppy because, by default, the LHT65 only transmits a payload once every 20 minutes. This can be changed, but at the expense of battery life.</p><p>This is a nice, evented system, albeit simple. The event flow looks like this:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F12b76ed9-95a3-4f65-8ecc-f9803f3e3142_1014x225.png">   </a>Event Flow for Pumphouse Temperature Sensor <p>I'll probably make this a bit more complete by adding a rule for managing thresholds and sending a text if the temperature gets too low or too high. Similarly, I should be getting notifications if the battery voltage gets too low. The battery is supposed to last 10 years, but that's exactly the kind of situation you need an alarm on—I'm likely to forget about it all before the battery needs replacing. I'd like to experiment with sending data the other way to adjust the frequency of readings. There might be times (like -35°F nights when the power is out) where getting more frequent results would reduce my anxiety.</p><p>This was a fun little project. I've got a bunch of these LHT65 temperature sensors, so I'll probably generalize this by turning the IoTPlotter ruleset into a module that other rulesets can use. I may eventually use a more sophisticated plotting package that can show me the data for all my devices on one feed. I bought a LoraWAN soil moisture probe for my garden. I've also got a solar array at my house that I'd like to monitor myself and that will need a dashboard of some kind. If you've got a sensor that isn't within easy range of wifi, then LoraWAN is a good solution. And event-based rules in picos are a convenient way to process the data.</p>   <p>Thanks for reading Phil Windley's Technometria!

<p><a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/">Bluesky</a>, a new social media platform and <a href="https://atproto.com/">AT Protocol</a>, is unsurprisingly running up against the same challenges and limitations that Flickr, Twitter and many other social media platforms faced in the 2000s: passwords!</p>

<p></p>

<p>You wouldn't give your Gmail password to Yelp, right? Why should you give your Bluesky password to random apps either!</p>

<p>The current official Bluesky iOS application unsurprisingly works by logging in with a username and password. It's the easiest form of authentication to implement, even if it is the least secure. Since Bluesky and the AT Protocol are actually intending on creating an entire ecosystem of servers and clients, this is inevitably going to lead to a complete security disaster. In fact, we're already seeing people spin up prototype Bluesky clients, sharing links around to them, which result in users being taught that there's nothing wrong with handing out their account passwords to random website and applications that ask for them. Clearly there has to be a solution, right?</p>

<p>The good news is there has been a solution that has existed for about 15 years -- OAuth! This is exactly the problem that OAuth was created to solve. How do we let third party applications access data in a web service without sharing the password with that application.</p>

<p>What's novel about Bluesky (and other similarly decentralized and open services like WordPress, Mastodon, Micro.blog, and others), is that there is an expectation that any user should be able to bring any client to any server, without prior relationships between client developers and servers. This is in contrast to consumer services like Twitter and Google, where they limit which developers can access their API by going through a developer registration process. I wrote more about this problem in a previous blog post, <a href="https://aaronparecki.com/2018/07/07/7/oauth-for-the-open-web">OAuth for the Open Web</a>.</p>

<p>There are two separate problems that Bluesky can solve with <a href="https://oauth.net">OAuth</a>, especially a flavor of OAuth like <a href="https://indieauth.net">IndieAuth</a>.</p>

 
 How apps can access data in the user's Personal Data Server (PDS) 
 How the user logs in to their PDS 
 

 How apps can access the user's data 

<p>This is the problem OAuth solved when it was originally created, and the problem ATProto currently has. It's obviously very unsafe to have users give their PDS password to every third party application that's created, especially since the ecosystem is totally open so there's no way for a user to know how legitimate a particular application is. OAuth solves this by having the application redirect to the OAuth server, the user logs in there, and then the application gets only an access token.</p>

<p>ATProto already uses <a href="https://atproto.com/lexicons/com-atproto-session">access tokens and refresh tokens</a>, (although they strangely call them <code>accessJwt</code> and <code>refreshJwt</code>) so this is a small leap to make. OAuth support in mobile apps has gotten a lot better than it was 10 years ago, and there is first class support for this pattern on iOS and Android to make the experience work better than the much older plain redirect model used to work a decade ago.</p>

<p>Here is what the rough experience the user would see when logging in to an app:</p>

<p></p>

 
 The user launches the app and taps the "Sign In" button 
 The user enters their handle or server name (e.g. <code>jay.bsky.social</code>, <code>bsky.social</code>, or <code>aaronpk.com</code>) 
 The app discovers the user's OAuth server, and launches an in-app browser 
 The user lands on their own PDS server, and logs in there (however they log in is not relevant to the app, it could be with a password, via email magic link, a passkey, or even delegated login to another provider) 
 The user is presented with a dialog asking if they want to grant access to this app (this step is optional, but it's up to the OAuth server whether to do this and what it looks like) 
 The application receives the authorization code and exchanges it at the PDS for an access token and refresh token 
 

<p><br></p>

<p>Most of this is defined in the core OAuth specifications. The part that's missing from OAuth is:</p>

 
 discovering an OAuth server given a server name 
 and how clients should be identified when there is no client preregistration step. 
 

<p>That's where <a href="https://indieauth.net">IndieAuth</a> fills this in. With IndieAuth, the user's authorization server is discovered by fetching the web page at their URL. IndieAuth avoids the need for client registration by also using URLs as OAuth <code>client_id</code>s.</p>

<p>This does mean IndieAuth assumes there is an HTML document hosted at the URL the user enters, which works well for web based solutions, and might even work well for Bluesky given the number of people who have already rushed to set their Bluesky handle to the same URL as their personal website. But, long term it might be an additional burden for people who want to bring their own domain to Bluesky if they aren't also hosting a website there.</p>

<p>There's a new discussion happening in the OAuth working group to enable this kind of authorization server discovery from a URL which could rely on DNS or a well-known endpoint. This is in-progress work at the IETF, and I would love to have ATProto/Bluesky involved in those discussions!</p>

 How the user logs in to their PDS 

<p>Currently, the AT Protocol specifies that login happens with a username and password to get the tokens the app needs. Once clients start using OAuth to log in to apps, this method can be dropped from the specification, which interestingly opens up a lot of new possibilities.</p>

<p>Passwords are inherently insecure, and there has been a multi-year effort to improve the security of every online service by adding two-factor authentication and even moving away from passwords entirely by using <a href="https://oauth.net/passkeys/">passkeys</a> instead.</p>

<p>Imagine today, Bluesky wants to add multifactor authenticaiton to their current service. There's no good way to add this to the existing API, since the Bluesky client will send the password to the API and expect an access token immediately. If Bluesky switches to an OAuth flow described above, then the app never sees the password, which means the Bluesky server can start doing more fun things with multifactor auth as well as even passwordless flows!</p>

 Logging in with a passkey 

<p>Here is the same sequence of steps but this time swapping out the password step for a passkey.</p>

<p></p>

 
 The user launches the app and taps the "Sign In" button 
 The user enters their handle or server name (e.g. <code>jay.bsky.social</code>, <code>bsky.social</code>, or <code>aaronpk.com</code>) 
 The app discovers the user's OAuth server, and launches an in-app browser 
 The user lands on their own PDS server, and logs in there with a passkey 
 The user is presented with a dialog asking if they want to grant access to this app (this step is optional, but it's up to the OAuth server whether to do this and what it looks like) 
 The application receives the authorization code and exchanges it at the PDS for an access token and refresh token 
 

<p>This is already a great improvement, and the nice thing is app developers don't need to worry about implementing passkeys, they just need to implement OAuth! The user's PDS implements passkeys and abstracts that away by providing the OAuth API instead.</p>

 Logging in with IndieAuth 

<p>Another variation of this would be if the Bluesky service itself supported delegating logins instead of managing any passwords or passkeys at all.</p>

<p>Since Bluesky already supports users setting their handle to their own personal website, it's a short leap to imaging allowing users to authenticate themselves to Bluesky using their website as well!</p>

<p>That is the exact problem IndieAuth already solves, with quite a few implementations in the wild of services that are IndieAuth providers, including <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a>, a <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/indieauth/">WordPress plugin</a>, a <a href="https://drupal.org/project/indieweb">Drupal module</a>, and many options for <a href="https://indieweb.org/IndieAuth#Server_Implementations">self-hosting</a> and endpoint.</p>

<p>Let's look at what the sequence would look like for a user to use the bsky.social PDS with their custom domain handle mapped to it.</p>

<p></p>

 
 The user launches the app and taps the "Sign In" button 
 The user enters their server name (e.g. <code>bsky.social</code>) 
 The app discovers the OAuth server and launches an in-app browser 
 The user enters their handle, and bsky.social determines whether to prompt for a password or do an IndieAuth flow to their server 
 The user is redirected to their own website (IndieAuth server) and authenticates there, and is then redirected back to bsky.social 
 The user is presented by bsky.social with a dialog asking if they want to grant access to this app 
 The application receives the authorization code and exchanges it at the PDS for an access token and refresh token 
 

<p>This is very similar to the previous flows, the difference being that in this version, bsky.social is the OAuth server as far as the app is concerned. The app never sees the user's actual IndieAuth server at all.</p>

 Further Work 

<p>These are some ideas to kick off the discussion of improving the security of Bluesky and the AT Protocol. Let me know if you have any thoughts on this! There is of course a lot more detail to discuss about the specifics, so if you're interested in diving in, a good place to start is reading up on <a href="https://oauth.net">OAuth</a> as well as the <a href="https://indieauth.net">IndieAuth</a> extension to OAuth which has solved some of the problems that exist in the space.</p>

<p>Welcome to the latest installment in the KERI Tutorial Series! In a <a href="https://kentbull.com/2023/01/27/keri-tutorial-series-kli-sign-and-verify-with-heartnet/">prior article</a> we learned how to use KERI to sign and verify simple messages. This tutorial goes to the full depth of issuing and verifying credentials (ACDCs).</p>



<p>We outfit our team of explorers bound on a treasure hunting journey with high tech security tags so the Gatekeeper will recognize them and permit them entrance into the most rewarding, yet dangerous, caverns of the secret underground chambers beneath the Osireion at Abydos. </p>



 Egyptian Story Time 



<p>An ancient city in Egypt from the time of the Pharaohs Abydos has long been known as a burial and memorial site for the ancient rulers. Yet, until recently, what had been kept a secret is the true purpose of Abydos and the Osireion, an entrance to an underground world full of bounty and treasure where the Egyptian rulers stored their most precious things. </p>



<p>Even with this revelation few could master the secret of how to travel between the Osireion and this underground world. Only two ever reliably figured it out, first the wise Ramiel and then his strong student Zaqiel. After they retrieved all the riches and treasure they wanted they realized they had an opportunity on their hands as guides for future explorers. Thus ATHENA was born.</p>



 

 Check out the 5 minute intro to this post and the ATHENA Network tutorial series!



 Opportunity 



<p>To establish a new standard in treasure hunting trust, and to capitalize on their opportunity, Ramiel and Zaqiel formed the Abydos Treasure Hunting Expedition Navigators Assembly (ATHENA) and began looking for a technology partner to build their Journey Mark trust system. Ramiel took on the role of the Wise Man to evaluate, grant marks to, and guide treasure hunters to Abydos while Zaqiel, the stronger of the two, took on the role of the Osireion Gatekeeper to ensure only those accepted by Ramiel would be given the opportunity to learn to travel to the underground world.</p>



 What ATHENA seeks to create 



<p>According to ATHENA, explorers desiring entrance through the Osireion must present a verifiable, secure proof signed by the Wise Man in order to be accepted by the Gatekeeper. Potential explorers must signify their intent to embark on a journey by presenting the Wise Man with another secure proof. </p>



<p>The diagram below shows the end state of their desired network.</p>


 
 


<p>On a practical note, get some refreshments and settle in as this post is large and contains many parts. It may take a few sessions to fully absorb the material depending on your existing familiarity with KERI and ACDC and the related Github repositories.</p>



 You meet the two 



<p>So how did you ever come to meet up with Ramiel and Zaqiel at ATHENA? It turns out the story is more believable than you might think.</p>


 
 


<p>While on a casual stroll at the Internet Identity Workshop (IIW) you had the good fortune of bumping into Ramiel and Zaqiel and they asked you how you would build the ATHENA security system. Since you had just left Dr. Samuel Smith’s session on composable event streaming representation (CESR) and had earlier been to Drummond Reed’s session KERI for Muggles where you learned about key event receipt infrastructure (KERI) and authentic chained data containers (ACDC), you realized they were the best decentralized key management infrastructure (DKMI) available and figured this would be the right tool to get the job done for ATHENA.</p>


 
 


<p>After hearing the details from Ramiel you became excited about the opportunity. You enthusiastically shook hands with them and began your work. Then, feeling a little in over your head and hoping for a concise and useful guide on KERI and ACDC to get you started on your development path, you hear Kaliya Identity Woman Young casually mention a link in the session notes she hounded the session presenter to write down. Grateful for her efforts you began to feel a sense of relief as you turned to the IIW QiQo site and found this blog post. A rush of hope and encouragement came and you dug in realizing you found the KERI manual you needed to get a simple prototype up and running.</p>



<p>Your job is to make this all happen.</p>



 What you can expect to learn 



 
 All of the components that are required for a basic KERI network including configuration 



 ACDC Credential Schema Creation, Issuance, and Revocation 



 KERI Command Line Interface (kli) and the (now deprecated) KERI Mark I Agent REST API  



 To learn about the KERIpy code. There are multiple references to important parts of the KERIpy codebase strewn throughout this tutorial. 



 A fair bit about BASH scripting if you read through the workflow.sh script.

<p>For now, let’s go to Abydos!</p>



 Going to the Osireion at Abydos 


 
 


 Our Task 



 
 Create the network foundation. 



 Create digital identities for each involved party. 



 Give a verifiable journey description to each interested explorer. 



 Request a Journey Mark for each explorer from the Wise Man. 



 As the Wise Man issue the Journey Mark to each member of the explorer party. 



 Present the Journey Marks to the Gatekeeper and grant access to the Osireion at Abydos. 
 



 Environment Setup 



<p>Check your environment-specific platform installation instructions for additional clarity though use the “All Platforms” list for a list of dependencies that ultimately must be installed on your machine and available from the command line.</p>



 All Platforms 



 
 Python 3.10+ required 



 Download the <a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial.git">Abydos Tutorial repository</a> with all of the example code:<br><code>$ git clone https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial</code>

 <code>$</code> <code>git clone https://github.com/kentbull/sally.git</code><br><code>$</code> <code>cd sally</code><br><code>$</code> <code>python -m pip install -e ./</code> 
 
 



 Libsodium
 
 <a href="https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/installation">https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/installation</a> 



 On my MacBook Pro I ended up having to do the full installation:
 
 Download a tarball from the <a href="https://download.libsodium.org/libsodium/releases/">releases page</a>.<br>Change directories to within the decompressed tarball.<br><code>$</code> <code>./configure</code><br><code>$</code> <code>make &amp;&amp; make check</code><br><code>$</code> <code>sudo make install</code> 
 
 
 
 



 vLEI credential caching server (vLEI-server)
 
 <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/vLEI.git">https://github.com/WebOfTrust/vLEI.git</a> 



 Clone the repository and do a Pip install<br><code>$ git clone https://github.com/WebOfTrust/vLEI.git</code><br><code>$ cd vLEI</code><br><code>$ python -m pip install -e ./</code> 
 
 
 



 OS X 



 
 With <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>: Install Python 3.10+, Python 3 PIP, Python 3 Venv, Libsodium-dev, maturin, and the Rust toolchain
 
 Installing Python 3.10+ on a Mac is a rather involved process since the operating system default installation can interfere with things. <br>Use the following freeCodeCamp guide to install “pyenv” and then install Python 3 on top of that: <br><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-version-on-mac-update/">How to Install Python 3 on Mac – Brew Install Update Tutorial</a> 



 <code>$ brew install libsodium</code> # warning, doesn’t work.<br># See above instructions on libsodium installation from the tarball to get things working on a Mac. You need Libsodium on your path, which <code>sudo make install</code> does. 



 <code>$ pip install maturin</code> # if you haven’t already 
 
 



 Install KERI
 
 <code>$ git clone git clone https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy.git</code> 



 <code>$ cd keripy</code> 



 <code>$ python -m pip install -e ./</code> 
 
 



 Verify your installation
 
 <code>$ kli version</code> 



 This should output something like “1.0.0”. 
 
 
 



 Windows 



<p>Thanks to Jim Martin for providing these Windows instructions.</p>



<p>See the <a href="https://kentbull.com/2023/01/27/keri-tutorial-series-kli-sign-and-verify-with-heartnet/#windows-manual-setup">Manual Setup with Windows</a> section of the KLI with Heartnet tutorial for instructions on setting up KERI on Windows.</p>



 Jump to the end with the <code>workflow.sh</code> script 



<p>If you want to quickly start up a network rather than working through the entire blog post piece by piece then you can use the <code>workflow.sh</code> script to start the whole network and perform all of the actions including schema linking, configuration file writing, witness network startup, controller configuration and startup, OOBI configuration, credential issuance, and credential revocation.</p>



<p>The workflow script accepts a few different ways of running it:</p>



 <code># from within the abydos-tutorial directory
#
# Option 1: run with the KLI and no clearing
./workflow.sh
# this will run the entire workflow yet will not clean up the ~/.keri, 
# ~/.sally, or the /usr/local/var/keri directories so you will need
# to manually clear those out in order to run the workflow script again.
#
# Option 2: run with the KLI and the clearing option
./workflow.sh -c true
# this runs the entire workflow using the KLI and clears out the KERI 
# directories mentioned above
#
# Option 3: run with the KERI Agent (Mark I - deprecated) and the
#           clearing option
./workflow.sh -a true -c true
# this runs the workflow using the KLI only where absolutely necessary
# and then cURL requests to the Agent API to perform the majority of the 
# workflow</code> 



<p>This is a great way to get you up and running. The entire workflow takes only 3 minutes for the KLI flow and 2.5 minutes for the Agent workflow. Reading through the BASH script may be the fastest way for you to learn how to use KERI if you are ready for that level of detail.</p>



 ATHENA Network 



<p>The ATHENA network includes:</p>



 
 three witnesses 



 four controllers (with one custom controller, the Abydos Gatekeeper) 



 four agents, one for each controller (Mark I Agent – deprecated) 



 a credential caching server 



 four distinct credential types. 



 a webhook 
 



<p>You will, of course, set up all of the configuration files and keystores for each witness and controller as well as perform all of the OOBI configuration for the network to function. See below for an overview.</p>



 Network Overview 


 
 


 Controllers 



<p>There is one controller each for Richard, Elayne, Zaqiel, and Ramiel. You will write the configuration files for each controller and create and incept their keystores.</p>



 Custom Controller 



<p>The one custom controller is the one for Zaqiel, the Abydos Gatekeeper controller. This controller needs to be customized in order to make the access control decisions for Abydos. This includes custom credential validators and presentation response payload constructors.</p>



 Witnesses 



<p>The same three witnesses are used for all of the controllers. Using the same witnesses for everything isn’t required and would be bad practice, though it simplifies the architecture for this post. You could easily use separate witnesses per controller with just a bit more tedious work. You will write the witness configuration files for each witness and set them up using the KLI.</p>



 Credential Caching Server 



<p>The vLEI-server from the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/vLEI">vLEI repository</a> is used as the credential caching server. It is a very simple HTTP fileserver that serves up ACDC schemas upon HTTP request. It would easily be implementable in any other language or tech stack if you needed it to be.</p>



 Agents 



<p>The agents use the current agent code in the KERIpy repository, called the Mark I Agent. This agent code is now deprecated even though it is nearly fully fleshed out. The new Mark II Agent is being developed as a separate repository in the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keria">KERIA repository</a>.</p>



 Webhook 



<p>The webhook is a simple HTTP server built on the <a href="https://github.com/ioflo/hio">ioflo/hio</a> library executed with <code>sally hook demo</code>. All it does is receive HTTP requests from the Abydos Gatekeeper custom controller, parse the JSON body, and print all of the headers and body values.</p>



 Foundational Vocabulary and Theory 



<p>Next we cover some basic vocabulary and acronyms so you can make your way through this post. I recommend you review Nuttawut Kongsuwan’s KERI jargon <a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#de18">summary</a> of the KERI whitepaper for an overview of the terminology in the space. You can always go to the <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf">KERI Whitepaper</a> or my <a href="https://kentbull.com/2022/06/05/keri-start/">KERI Mind Map blog post</a> as well for a list of documents central to the KERI space that will assist you in gaining a full understanding of the concepts and the terminology.</p>



<p><a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#48aa">KERI</a> – Key Event Receipt Infrastructure. A decentralized public key infrastructure for self certifying identifiers aiming at security as a top priority while following the design principle of “minimally sufficient means.” The foundation for the verifiable credentials technology called authentic chained data containers.</p>



<p><a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#7344">AID</a> -autonomic identifier. a self-certifying identifier that is the primary root of trust in KERI. AIDs are decentralized identifiers that do not rely on a blockchain.</p>



<p><a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#2627">Controller</a> – a node or an individual set of cryptographic keys, their key event logs (KELs), and associated data. Consists of a keystore directory, a set of autonomic identifiers (AIDs), key event logs, any credentials, transaction event logs, and out of band introductions.<br>Also considered to be a running instance of a KERI controller software such as <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy">KERIpy</a> (Python KERI controller) or <a href="https://github.com/THCLab/keriox">KERIox</a> (Rust KERI controller).</p>



<p><a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#a998">Witness</a> – a trusted entity designated by another controller as a witness to anything that happens for an AID controlled by that controller. Each witness must provide witness receipts to each event in a key event log. </p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy">KERIpy</a> – the Python implementation of KERI including the  controller implementation. This Python implementation is considered authoritative as the KERI core team builds it along with Dr. Samuel M. Smith. </p>



<p>Agent – The HTTP API to a KERI controller.</p>



<p>OOBI – out of band introduction. The core discovery mechanism of KERI. Each OOBI defines a path of communication between controllers or a location where a resource like an ACDC schema resides. Think of this as something like a DNS entry or an iptables entry, or an address in an address book. If you have an OOBI for a controller or object you want to talk to then you can reach it over the internet.</p>



<p>ACDC – authentic chained data container; verifiable credential. The fundamental unit of data shared between KERI controllers meant for instrumenting business process workflows that use verifiable credentials.<br>An append-only, graph-linked data structure that is secure and verifiable.</p>



<p>Edge – a link (or chain) between two ACDCs. </p>



<p>ACDC Schema – the detailed description of precisely what data is allowed to be placed into any given ACDC.</p>



<p>Credential Registry – where ACDCs are issued from.</p>



<p>Ricardian Contract – In ACDCs they are a way to link the legal system to specific ACDCs. This comes in the Rules section of ACDCs.</p>



 Admittance Workflow 



<p>The purpose of all of this business about identifiers and credentials is to support a basic admittance workflow into Abydos, specifically the Osireion at the back of Abydos. In order to support this workflow we use verifiable credentials.</p>



 Credentials Overview 



<p>For the explorers to be granted admittance into Abydos the admittance workflow must be followed:</p>



 
 The Wise Man must issue TreasureHuntingJourney credentials to each explorer wishing to go on a treasure hunt to Abydos. 



 Each explorer must issue a JourneyMarkRequest credential for the treasure hunt they want to embark on by pointing to a specific TreasureHuntingJourney credential in their request. 



 As the Wise Man approves each explorer he is to issue a JourneyMark as an approval of the explorer’s desire to embark on the journey. This approval should point to the specific request each explorer made for a specific journey. 



 Once a sufficient number of JourneyMark credentials are issued by the Wise Man and the journey threshold has been crossed he is to issue a JourneyCharter to each explorer signifying his approval of their journey. 



 The JourneyCharter credential is to be presented by each explorer to the Gatekeeper in order to be granted entrance into Abydos. 
 



<p>To understand this workflow we first cover the credential map itself, how to write a credential, and how to link each of the schemas together using the KASLCred tool.</p>



 Visual workflows and use cases for credential issuance 



<p>Each of the credential issuance flows is described visually below.</p>



 1 – TreasureHuntingJourney issuance flow 



<p>As a Wise Man (ATHENA official) I want to provide confidence to potential explorers so that I may attract them to go on a treasure hunting journey.</p>



<p>To do this the WiseMan issues the TreasureHuntingJourney credential.</p>


 
 


 2 – JourneyMarkRequest issuance flow 



<p>As an Explorer I want to indicate a serious interest on a specific TreasureHuntingJourney so that ATHENA will hold my spot.</p>



<p>To do this an Explorer (or Librarian) issues to the WiseMan a JourneyMarkRequest pointing to a specific TreasureHuntingJourney credential.</p>


 
 


 3 – JourneyMark issuance flow 



<p>As a Wise Man I want to endorse a particular Explorer for a specific TreasureHuntingJourney so that the journey can be chartered once a threshold of party membership is reached.</p>



<p>To do this the Wise Man issues the JourneyMark to those Explorers whose JourneyMarkRequests he approves. The JourneyMark points to the specific JourneyMarkRequest submitted by an explorer.</p>


 
 


 4 – JourneyCharter issuance flow 



<p>As a Wise Man I want to charter a treasure hunting journey once a party membership threshold is reached so that the explorers can present this charter credential to the Gatekeeper and gain entrance into Abydos.</p>



<p>To do this the WiseMan issues the JourneyCharter credential to each Explorer going on the journey indicated in the TreasureHuntingJourney credential. The JourneyCharter points to both the JourneyMark and the TreasureHuntingJourney credential.</p>


 
 


 5 – JourneyCharter presentation flow 



<p>As an Abydos Gatekeeper I want to allow authorized Explorers into Abydos so that they can have a good time on a treasure hunting journey.</p>



<p>To do this the Explorers present the JourneyCharter credential to Zaqiel the Gatekeeper, Zaqiel then validates the credential, and makes an access control decision on whether to allow an Explorer in to Abydos.</p>


 
 


 Credential Map 



<p>You decided to represent the secure proofs as four data containers (ACDC), or verifiable credentials (VC), with links between the different credentials as shown below. This graph shows the credentials and their links to each other, or edges. Each edge is named, as you will see later on in the schema map JSON file.</p>



 ATHENA Credential Graph 


 
 


 
 (1) <a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/athena/schemas/treasure-hunting-journey.json">TreasureHuntingJourney</a>: One for the Wise Man to describe the overall treasure hunting experience from start to end, treasure splits for hunting party members, the destination, and the like. This will be issued by the Wise Man to each potential explorer. 



 (2) <a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/athena/schemas/journey-mark-request.json">JourneyMarkRequest</a>: One for a potential explorer to request to join the treasure hunting journey. This will be issued to the Wise Man by an explorer. 



 (3) <a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/athena/schemas/journey-mark.json">JourneyMark</a>: One for the Wise man to issue to the accepted explorers so the Gatekeeper can know who the Wise Man has authorized for the journey. 



 (4) <a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/athena/schemas/journey-charter.json">JourneyCharter</a>: One that the explorer party can use to prove they are authorized for their journey to all who care to know as well as for the Gatekeeper to verify that they were authorized as a party. 
 



<p>In order to understand the credential schemas we must first cover some background knowledge on why schemas in ACDC are constructed the way they are, the purpose they serve, and how to use them.</p>



 ACDC Schema Writing 



<p><a href="https://json-schema.org/specification.html">JSON Schema</a> is the schema language ACDC schemas are expressed in. Beyond this schema language  <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ssmith-said-02.html#section-2.4-8">self addressing data</a> and <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ssmith-said-02.html#abstract">self addressing identifiers</a> are the mechanism used to verify schemas. With security first as a design principle self addressing data combines well with JSON schema to provide a secure schema capability for the KERI and ACDC ecosystem.</p>



 ACDC Credential Schemas with JSON Schema 



<p>For each ACDC we use there must be a schema defining the shape of the data in the container or credential. This schema must be verifiable and protected from schema revocation and schema malleability attacks. Using self addressing data (SAD) through the use of self addressing identifiers (SAIDs) makes it easy to accomplish both of these security objectives along with the business process objective of having a verifiable shape or envelope for our data.</p>



 What does an ACDC look like? 



 TreasureHuntingjourney credential issuance example JSON export 



<p>This is getting a little bit ahead of ourselves though a visual of what a credential looks like will help you understand where we are going. Take a quick look at what an issued JourneyMarkRequest looks like, how to get it, and then move on to the next section.</p>



 <code>{
  "v": "ACDC10JSON0001d9_",
  "d": "EEXZuecxP4Y3xZxvA_DtnrPX8nbSDPeGaMIxNKvLVENb",
  "i": "EIaJ5gpHSL9nl1XIWDkfMth1uxbD-AfLkqdiZL6S7HkZ",
  "ri": "EF3hGwYMK0r74qlSRbKw3_RzCrJ8D2Xmv5BlunrN3NC2",
  "s": "EIxAox3KEhiQ_yCwXWeriQ3ruPWbgK94NDDkHAZCuP9l",
  "a": {
    "d": "EPZSit7DYobEAv3WkVk2GBoBWrdglaHImi3_lnoc5fNl",
    "i": "EJS0-vv_OPAQCdJLmkd5dT0EW-mOfhn_Cje4yzRjTv8q",
    "dt": "2023-03-21T15:39:14.560430+00:00",
    "destination": "Osireion",
    "treasureSplit": "50/50",
    "partyThreshold": 2,
    "journeyEndorser": "Ramiel"
  }
}</code> 



<p>This JSON export of a credential is obtained with the KLI command <code>kli vc export</code> as shown below:</p>



 <code>RICHARD_CRED_SAID=$(kli vc list --name explorer --alias richard --said --schema EIxAox3KEhiQ_yCwXWeriQ3ruPWbgK94NDDkHAZCuP9l)
kli vc export --name explorer --alias richard --said $RICHARD_CRED_SAID</code> 



<p>This particular execution of the command assumes there is only one credential to be listed by the <code>kli vc list</code> command for the schema <code>EIxAox3KEhiQ_yCwXWeriQ3ruPWbgK94NDDkHAZCuP9l</code>, the schema identifier for the TreasureHuntingJourney schema. If there were multiple TreasureHuntingJourney credentials then there would be multiple SAIDs output by that command then you would pick one of them to be the argument to the <code>--said</code> parameter in order to export it’s JSON.</p>



 What is an ACDC schema made of? 



 TreasureHuntingjourney schema creation 



<p>The first schema to write is the JSON Schema for the <a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/athena/schemas/treasure-hunting-journey.json">TreasureHuntingJourney</a> credential that Richard and Elayne must receive from the Wise Man Ramiel in order to submit their treasure hunting request as a JourneyMarkRequest later. In order to write this schema we must first understand all of the elements that go into an ACDC schema.</p>



 Schema Parts 



<p>Each ACDC schema has five main parts:</p>



 
 Schema metadata (required) 



 Properties section (required) 



 Attributes section (required) 



 Edges section (if used) 



 Rules section (if used) 
 



<p>This is a collapsed view of the <a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/athena/schemas/treasure-hunting-journey.json">TreasureHuntingJourney schema</a>.</p>


 
 


<p>As you can see it has metadata, properties, attributes, and rules yet no edges. This is because this TreasureHuntingJourney ACDC does not extend nor connect with any other ACDC. This ACDC could appear as an edge in another ACDC though it does not have any edges itself.</p>



<p>Keep in mind that this instance of the TreasureHuntingJourney schema does not have any “$id” properties filled out yet. This tells you we are still writing the schema and are working from the template that will have the SAIDs added to, or “SAIDified.” We will do that step later after we finish writing the schema itself.</p>



<p>First we shall explain the attributes of the schema from outer to inner, top to bottom. Each of the attributes has a specific purpose we get into below.</p>



 SCHEMA description – top-layer 



<p>While ACDC schemas use the JSON Schema <a href="https://json-schema.org/specification.html">specification</a> in most regards the repurposing of the “$id” field is a notable exception. The top-most $id, $schema, title, description, type, credentialType, and version properties are about the ACDC schema itself. What is contained inside of the ACDC is described by what comes in the properties section which is further clarified by the additionalProperties and required attributes.</p>



 
 $id : The self addressing identifier (SAID) of the overall schema. This can only be computed when all of the dependent SAIDs for all attribute (e), edge (e), and rule (r) blocks have been computed and embedded within the respective $id attributes of each block. <br>This field is repurposed to provide a unique identifier of the schema instance. This is because in ACDCs all schemas are self addressing and so there is no separate document to retrieve such as in the non-ACDC usage of the $id field where the field contains a base URI fragment. Since the schema is keyed and stored by SAID rather than a Retrieval URI then there is little to no benefit from storing a retrieval URI in the $id section.<br>See the <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/draft-ssmith-acdc.html#name-schema-id-field-label">$id section</a> of the ACDC specification for a more complete explanation.
 
 Example Value: EDiuqE2fD2MhrSpZhAzlZn8XLSJiHt1pyy1eEWB-l1qq 
 
 



 $schema: This is typically set to the value of “<a href="http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#">http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#</a>“. The valid values can be found in the <a href="https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/schema.html">$schema</a> documentation of the JSON Schema specification. 



 title: a short descriptive name you as the schema designer can write. Can have spaces and punctuation 



 description: A longer explanation of the type of credential, what it is used for, or any other useful credential-related information. 



 type: A JSON schema field that can be an object, array, numeric type, boolean, string, or other accepted value according to the <a href="https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/index.html">JSON Schema Reference</a>. 



 credentialType: A field you can use to specify the specific type name of a credential. This is like a class name in an object oriented language and can be PascalCase with no spaces following typical object naming rules in many data languages and programming languages. 



 version: A version field for this specific credential type. This manages semantic version for the credential type you are using. This is a field you can use for schema versioning and migration. 
 
 This is distinct from the “v” version field described in the <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/draft-ssmith-acdc.html#name-version-string-field">Version String Field</a> section of the ACDC specification. This “version” field is the schema version. The ACDC “v” field specifies the serialization format version and the size of the serialized data type.  



 Keep in mind these two fields are separate and are used for different purposes even though they have a similar name.  



 Remembering that the short name occurs only in ACDC instances and that the long name occurs only in ACDC schemas is a good way to keep the concepts distinct in your mind. 
 
 



 properties: This is the section where you define the data attributes that will exist in a minted ACDC as seen above. The values for the properties in this section are provided during issuance with the data argument in <code>kli vc issue --data</code>.  



 additionalProperties: This is used to control handling of extra attributes not defined in the “properties” section. Can be “false” or a rule like <code>{ "type": "string" }</code> that constrains what additional properties can be added to a schema.<br>See the <a href="https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/object.html#additionalproperties">additionalProperties section</a> of JSON Schema. 



 required: Defines the list of properties that must appear in the “properties” section. By default the properties in the “properties” section are not required. See the “<a href="https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/object.html#required-properties">Required Properties</a>” part of the JSON Schema specification. 
 



<p>With all of the metadata properties covered we next describe the properties section of the TreasureHuntingJourney credential where you describe the fields of your custom data that will be a part of the credential.</p>



 TreasureHuntingJourney Properties 



<p>Only a small amount of data is written inside of a TreasureHuntingJourney credential:</p>



 <code>{
  "destination": "Osireion",
  "treasureSplit": "50/50",
  "partyThreshold": 2,
  "journeyEndorser": "Ramiel"
}</code> 



<p>The TreasureHuntingJourney credential is intended to provide information to prospective explorers about a journey they could embark on. This includes where the journey is headed, the destination, the proportion of treasure proceeds split amongst each journey party member, the minimum party threshold for the journey to be chartered, as well as the individual who chartered the journey.</p>



<p>The properties section of an ACDC schema is the location to include custom business-process data as shown above for the TreasureHuntingJourney credential.</p>



 Writing The Properties schema 



<p>Writing a schema to describe this small set of data requires a rather verbose description using JSON schema and though tedious is simple to understand once you get the hang of it.</p>



<p>In addition to this data there is a rules section “r” we will get into later when we talk about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricardian_contract">Ricardian Contracts</a> though for now we focus only on the data going into the credential, the “a” section.</p>



<p>Writing a properties section with JSON Schema to describe this requires both metadata and an attributes section.</p>


 
 


<p>The ACDC constraints written in KERI requires the presence of a number of metadata attributes in the properties section as shown below. Each attribute is linked to the appropriate section in the ACDC specification. The overall field map description is provided here: <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/draft-ssmith-acdc.html#name-top-level-fields">Top-Level Fields</a>.</p>



 
 <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/draft-ssmith-acdc.html#name-version-string-field">v</a> – “Version”: This describes the version of the serialization format and size used to write the schema. 



 <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/draft-ssmith-acdc.html#name-said-self-addressing-identi">d</a> – “SAID or identifier”: This provides a stable, universal, cryptographically verifiable and agile reference to the properties block. 



 <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/draft-ssmith-acdc.html#name-uuid-universally-unique-ide">u</a> – “Universally Unique Identifier as a Nonce”: A salty nonce used to provide cryptographic security to the “d” field to protect against brute force attacks such as rainbow table attacks to guess the block’s contents. This field is optional. 



 <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/draft-ssmith-acdc.html#name-aid-autonomic-identifier-an">i</a> – “Autonomic Identifier”: The identifier of the issuer of this ACDC. 



 <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/draft-ssmith-acdc.html#name-aid-autonomic-identifier-an">ri</a> – “Registry Identifier (Derived Identifier)”: The registry is the credential registry that this particular ACDC was issued from. This is derived from the “i” field for the issuer who issued the ACDC. A controller can create and use one or more registries. 



 <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/draft-ssmith-acdc.html#name-top-level-fields">s</a> – “Schema SAID”: The SAID of the schema to be used to validate this properties block. 



 <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/draft-ssmith-acdc.html#name-attribute-section">a</a> – “Attribute map”: The list of attributes that defines this schema. This is where the JSON data from above gets placed into the credential. 



 <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/draft-ssmith-acdc.html#name-rule-section">r</a> – “Rules section”: This is where any Ricardian Contracts (code as law) are stored in the credential. 
 



<p>Other than the metadata attributes the “a” and “r” properties, attributes and rules, are the more interesting parts. The “a” section is where you will describe the data properties that will be placed in your ACDC.</p>



 TreasureHuntingJourney Attributes Section  



<p>The attributes section can be one of two things as shown in the JSON schema, either a SAID or an inner block with its own properties.</p>



 <code>...
"a": 
  "oneOf": [
    {
      "description": "Attributes block SAID",
      "type": "string"
    },
    {
      "$id": "EPfNU6jej4GGyprpakq6KCO9os9vp9jLIRcH1xJqVezj",
      "description": "Attributes block",
      "type": "object",
      "properties": { 
...</code> 



 oneOf Operator and compact ACDC 



<p>The oneOf operator in JSON Schema means that the “a” section can be one of either of these two things. For ACDCs this means that the “a” block can be either the condensed version, which is the SAID of the “a” block, or it can be the entire contents of the “a” block. The condensed version is called a “<a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/draft-ssmith-acdc.html#name-compact-acdc">Compact ACDC</a>” and can be seen as equivalent to the un-condensed, or un-compacted version of the ACDC. </p>



<p>We are not covering compact ACDCs in this article so we move on to the full or un-compacted ACDC. </p>



 Full or un-compacted ACDC 



<p>The full ACDC schema includes another set of metadata attributes, and identifier field “$id”, and another properties section. JSON Schema as you can see is very verbose. Looking a level deeper we see the following set of attributes inside the “a” block:</p>


 
 


<p>Now this is starting to look like the JSON data we intend to put in the credential. Inside of the “a” block we see another “$id” field as well as other metadata fields from JSON Schema including the “description”, “type”, and “properties” fields. As those are mostly self explanatory we move on to the inner “properties” block.</p>



<p>Each property has a name, a description, and a type:</p>



 <code>...
"properties": {
  "d": {
    "description": "Attributes block SAID",
    "type": "string"
  },
...</code> 



<p>The “type” field must be one of the valid types from the list in <a href="https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/type.html#type-specific-keywords">JSON Schema</a>:</p>



 
 <a href="https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/string.html#string">string</a> 



 <a href="https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/numeric.html#number">number</a> 



 <a href="https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/numeric.html#integer">integer</a> 



 <a href="https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/object.html#object">object</a> 



 <a href="https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/array.html#array">array</a> 



 <a href="https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/boolean.html#boolean">boolean</a> 



 <a href="https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/null.html#null">null</a> 
 



<p>The “description” field is a schema-writer field to put a human-readable, concise definition of what the field contains.</p>



 Inner Properties block metadata fields 



<p>The inner properties block has a set of metadata fields that the ACDC code in KERI fills out for you including the “d” (SAID), “i” (issuee), and “dt” (date and time stamp) fields. They are required attributes in the top level of the inner properties block and look like the following in the JSON schemas where they appear:</p>



 ...
"properties": {
  "d": {
    "description": "Attributes block SAID",
    "type": "string"
  },
  "i": {
    "description": "Issuee AID",
    "type": "string"
  },
  "dt": {
    "description": "Issuance date time",
    "type": "string",
    "format": "date-time"
  },
... 



<p>The $id field is a SAID of the “a” attributes block. This provides the “a” block with cryptographic protection and verifiability when signed by a KERI key.</p>



 Inner Properties Block Custom Fields 



<p>Following the required properties you define your own custom properties to be added to the ACDC. In the case of the TreasureHuntingJourney credential those properties include the “destination”, “treasureSplit”, “partyThreshold”, and “journeyEndorser” fields as follows:</p>



 ...
"properties": {
  ...
  "destination": {
    "description": "The target location for this journey where the hunters will go.",
    "type": "string"
  },
  "treasureSplit": {
    "description": "The type of splits for this journey. 50/50, 25/25/25/25, and so forth. Must add up to 100.",
    "type": "string"
  },
  "partyThreshold": {
    "description": "The minimum party member threshold needed to charter this journey",
    "type": "integer"
  },
  "journeyEndorser": {
    "description": "The AID of the ATHENA inner circle member endorsing this treasure hunting journey.",
    "type": "string"
  }
... 



<p>Each field has a description and a type. The validation of each field is up to the issuer or the verifier of the credential.</p>



 The Edge Section 



<p>We will briefly cover the JourneyMarkRequest schema since we have not covered edge sections yet. The TreasureHuntingJourney credential has no edges so it isn’t a good example of a credential with an edge section.</p>



 JourneyMarkRequest Schema 



<p>As you can see the JourneyMarkRequest has an additional attribute, the “e” section. This is for edges, or chains between individual ACDCs.</p>


 
 


<p>The edge section is very similar to an “attributes” section except it is specialized. It contains a “oneOf” operator similar to the “attributes” section since the edge section may also be represented by a SAID in the most compact version, or any compact version, of an ACDC.</p>


 
 


<p>Inside of the Edges block, the second item in this “oneOf” array, we see a set of common properties. $id, description, and type are what we have seen before, as is properties. Inside the properties block we find something slightly different.</p>


 
 


<p>The “d” field is the SAID of this particular edges block and is computed from the other properties which in this case is just the “journey” property.</p>



<p>The “journey” property is the actual edge that points to the TreasureHuntingJourney credential (not the TreasureHintingJourney – typo).</p>



<p>The “n” field is the SAID of the far side credential, the TreasureHuntingJourney.</p>



<p>The “s” field is the SAID of the ACDC schema for the TreasureHuntingJourney.</p>



<p>Defining an edge section like this in a schema is the foundation of what is needed to add in an edge between these two credentials later during the credential issuance process.</p>



 The Other Schemas 



<p>With this nearly exhaustive explanation of one of the four schemas complete and a small amount on the JourneyMarkREquest edge we will leave the writing or reading of the other three of the four schemas up to the reader. This includes the JourneyMarkRequest, JourneyMark, and JourneyCharter. You may find the ATHENA version of the other schemas in the <code>athena<a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/tree/master/athena/schemas">/schemas</a></code> directory. They will be described briefly below at a high level. You can apply the schema writing concepts from above to all of the other schemas.</p>



<p>Just glance over the following pictures to get a sense of what is in each schema and them move on to the credential linking section afterwards. </p>



 JourneyMark Schema 



<p>Has the following properties:</p>


 
 


<p>And edge properties for “request”</p>


 
 


 JourneyCharter Schema 



<p>Has the following properties:</p>


 
 


<p>And the following edges. Something different for the JourneyCharter schema is that it links to two edges, both “mark” and “journey”:</p>


 
 


 Linking Schemas 



<p>One concept we have not yet covered is how to link schemas together. We cover this next in the Schema Linking and Verification section via the use of the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/kaslcred/">KASLCred utility</a>.</p>



 Schema Linking and Verification 



<p>Linking schemas with <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/draft-ssmith-acdc.html#section-2.4">self addressing data</a> is part of the way ACDCs provide security, specifically end-verifiability, of credentials. For data to be self addressing it must contain an identifier that is computed from the contents of the data, a digest. Self addressing data protects against security exploits like schema malleability and schema revocation attacks while also being an easy way to verify the contents of the data. These self addressing identifiers are placed in the “<a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/draft-ssmith-acdc.html#name-said-self-addressing-identi">$id</a>” attributes of the various blocks in ACDC schemas.</p>



<p>Here is an example self addressing identifier for the TreasureHuntingJourney ACDC shown above: <code>EEXZuecxP4Y3xZxvA_DtnrPX8nbSDPeGaMIxNKvLVENb</code></p>



 Self Addressing Data (SAD) and Self Addressing Identifiers (SAIDs) 



<p>The self addressing identifier (SAID) is like a key in a key-value pair and the data is like the value except that the identifier computation algorithm allows for the SAID to be embedded in the data. This requires a two pass process, one to calculate the identifier, and the second to embed it within the data. Verifying self addressing data also requires a two-pass verification function, one pass to remove the embedded identifier, and the second to verify the data against the SAID. To fully understand the self addressing identifier concept refer to the <a href="https://weboftrust.github.io/ietf-said/draft-ssmith-said.html">IETF Draft Specification for Self-Addressing IDentifier (SAID)</a> by Samuel smith. </p>



 Schema Evaluation to compute SAIDs 



<p>Using self addressing identifiers (SAIDs) with a graph of schemas means that the credential schemas must be evaluated in a deterministic order and have their “$id” properties populated from the inner-most or top-most schema to the outer-most or bottom-most schema. In this sense the outer-most schema points to the innermost schema and the bottom-most schema points to the top-most schema as in the ATHENA Credential Graph diagram above and reproduced below for reference. This proper order requires computing a dependency graph of the schemas based on their edges (dependencies) in order to facilitate generating identifiers on the inner-most (or top-most) schemas and then each layer outward to the outermost (or bottom-most) schemas. </p>


 
 


 Graph Evaluation Order 



<p>In our case our graph must be generated in the following order:</p>



 
 TreasureHuntingJourney (root node, no dependents) 



 JourneyMarkRequest (dependent on TreasureHuntingJourney) 



 JourneyMark (dependent on JourneyMarkRequest) 



 JourneyCharter (dependent on both JourneyMark and TreasureHuntingJourney) 
 



<p>Your options here are to either do this by hand with the <code>kli saidify</code> command and manually editing all of the schema files or you can use the code in the <code><a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/vLEI/blob/dev/src/vlei/generate.py">generate.py</a></code> file from the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/vLEI">WebOfTrust/vLEI</a> repository as a guide. Alternatively you could use the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/kaslcred/">KASLCred</a> Python package to do all of the linking for you. For this post we will use KASLCred in the interest of time.</p>



 KASLCred 



<p>While the intricacies of parsing ACDC schemas and adding SAIDs in the “$id” attributes are interesting, also called “saidifying” the schemas, in the interest of time we will use the KASLCred utility written to do all the saidifying for you. You can go read the Python code of the <a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/kaslcred">TetraVeda/kaslcred</a> repository if you want to see how it was done. It’s only a few hundred lines of code.</p>



 KASLCred Schema Map 



<p>Using KASLCred to evaluate your schema graph involves writing a schema map file expressing the set of credentials to be evaluated in a JSON file. The “athena/schemas/athena-schema-map.json” file from the tutorial repository is reproduced below for reference:</p>



 <code>{
  "schemas": [
    {
      "schemaName": "JourneyCharter",
      "schemaFilePath": "journey-charter.json",
      "dependencies": ["JourneyMark", "TreasureHuntingJourney"],
      "edgeName": ""
    },
    {
      "schemaName": "JourneyMarkRequest",
      "schemaFilePath": "journey-mark-request.json",
      "dependencies": ["TreasureHuntingJourney"],
      "edgeName": "request"
    },
    {
      "schemaName": "TreasureHuntingJourney",
      "schemaFilePath": "treasure-hunting-journey.json",
      "dependencies": [],
      "edgeName": "journey"
    },
    {
      "schemaName": "JourneyMark",
      "schemaFilePath": "journey-mark.json",
      "dependencies": ["JourneyMarkRequest"],
      "edgeName": "mark"
    }
  ]
}</code> 



 Evaluation Order 



<p>As you can see this list of schemas is out of order. The first item in the list, JourneyCharter, should be evaluated last. And the third item in the list, TreasureHuntingJourney, should be evaluated first. This is no problem for KASLCred as it reads the dependencies array and reorders the schemas to be evaluated in the order where the least dependent item (with no dependencies) is evaluated first and then the next most dependent item is evaluated after all of its dependencies is evaluated and so forth for all dependencies.</p>



<p>Using KASLCred is as simple as a Pip Install and a <code>python -m</code> invocation once you have Libsodium and KERI installed:</p>



 <code># Install KERI and Libsodium as noted in the installation instructions above
pip install kaslcred==0.0.8
# Set ABYDOS_REPO_DIR to where you cloned the abydos-tutorial repo.
# Usage: python -m kaslcred [schemas dir] [results dir] [schema map file]
python -m kaslcred \
  ${ABYDOS_REPO_DIR}/athena/schemas \
  ${ABYDOS_REPO_DIR}/athena/saidified_schemas \
  ${ABYDOS_REPO_DIR}/athena/schemas/athena-schema-map.json</code> 



<p>As long as all of the file names in the <code>schemaFilePath</code> properties in the schema map JSON file exist then you will end up with a set of SAIDified schemas ready to use.</p>



 Quick overview of the other schemas 



<p>Review the JSON contents of the abydos-tutorial/athena/credential_data directory to get a sense for what kind of business process we are building on top of these schemas. We reproduce them here to illustrate their purpose.</p>



 JourneyMarkRequest data – for Richard 



 <code>{
  "requester": {
    "firstName": "Richard",
    "lastName": "Ayris",
    "nickname": "Dunkie"
  },
  "desiredPartySize": 2,
  "desiredSplit": 50.00
}</code> 



<p>As you can see here this credential looks a lot like an account registration HTTP REST API request. You can really do anything with ACDC credentials. It also indicates preferences to the ATHENA explorer matchmaking engine with the desired party size and the desired split.</p>



 JourneyMark data – for Richard 



 <code>{
  "journeyDestination": "Osireion",
  "gatekeeper": "Zaqiel",
  "negotiatedSplit": 50.00
}</code> 



<p>This data indicates where Richard will be going and other details of the journey. Remember that the JourneyMark has a graph edge pointing to the JourneyMarkRequest which means credential consumers can also resolve data from both the JourneyMarkRequest and the TreasureHuntingJourney credentials through those links.</p>



 JourneyCharter data – for Richard 



 <code>{
  "partySize": 2,
  "authorizerName": "Ramiel"
}</code> 



<p>As the final data packet sent as an ACDC this credential indicates what each explorer stands to expect on the chartered journey such as how many members they will be traveling with and who officially blessed their journey.</p>



 Schemas Review 



<p>Now that we have written the needed schemas for ATHENA and have SAIDified them with KASLCred we are ready to use them in configuring our trust network components as well as to issue and verify credentials. </p>



<p>Next we configure our trust network to cache these schemas with the vLEI caching server implementation (vLEI-server). </p>



 Network Configuration 



<p>Configuring a KERI network involves setting up the following components:</p>



 
 ACDC Schema Caching 



 Witnesses 



 Controllers 



 Agents (if you are using them) 



 Performing Out Of Band Introductions (OOBIs) between controllers and objects 
 



<p>Our setup will involve the following additional components</p>



 
 A customized controller used for the Abydos Gatekeeper to decide whether or not explorers can be permitted to enter Abydos. It will be configured to trust one issuer, the Wise Man, that will be used to check the issuance of the JourneyCharter credentials against. 



 A webhook the customized controller communicates with to tie credential presentation and revocation events into a custom business logic layer. 
 



<p>Here is the network component diagram again for reference:</p>


 
 


<p>Schema caching is first item to be set up as all of the controllers depend on it. You could set up witnesses first as well. It is up to you.</p>



 Schema Caching 



<p>In order to successfully receive, validate, and handle an ACDC each KERI controller using that ACDC must be able to resolve and load the schema for that ACDC. The schemas are resolved based on the SAID of the schema using an out of band introduction (OOBI) that indicates the location the schema is stored at and can be retrieved from. The controller may either be configured with the location of this schema on startup in the controller bootstrap JSON configuration file or be configured at runtime through usage of the OOBI resolution mechanism.</p>



 vLEI-server 


 
 


<p> The vLEI-server provides a convenient implementation of a simple caching server that meets our needs. All the vLEI caching server (vLEI-server) does is make the schemas available as JSON objects as responses to HTTP requests. It could very easily be rewritten in your favorite language if you wanted a fun, easy challenge. (Hint, write it in Rust, the KERI community will be happy with you.)</p>



<p>Once you have the vLEI repository cloned and the vLEI-server installed as described in the installation instructions above you can run the vLEI-server with a command similar to the following:</p>



 <code># Change directories to the abydos-tutorial repository directory.
# Set ATHENA_DIR to be your abydos-tutorial/athena directory.
vLEI-server \
  -s "${ATHENA_DIR}"/saidified_schemas \
  -c "${ATHENA_DIR}"/cache/acdc \
  -o "${ATHENA_DIR}"/cache/oobis</code> 



<p>This will give you output similar to the following:</p>



 <code>caching schema EIxAox3KEhiQ_yCwXWeriQ3ruPWbgK94NDDkHAZCuP9l
caching schema ELc8tMg_hhsAPfVbjUBBC-giEy5440oSb9EzFBZdAxHD
caching schema EBEefH4LNQswHSrXanb-3GbjCZK7I_UCL6BdD-zwJ4my
caching schema EEq0AkHV-i5-aCc1JMBGsd7G85HlBzI3BfyuS5lHOGjr</code> 



<p>If you have anything in the <code>cache/acdc</code> or <code>cache/oobis</code> directories then those will be shown in the log output as well.</p>



<p>With the ACDC schemas successfully being cached the next step is to deploy the witness network which requires writing witness configuration files.</p>



 Witness Network 



<p>Our witness network consists of three of the witnesses used in the KERI Demonstration Witness network meaning we use the same cryptographic key salts, keystore names, and alias names.</p>



<p>This means we need a configuration file for each of the witnesses. The document symbols you see on the preceding diagram show the filenames for each of the witnesses represented by a gray circle.</p>



<p>To set up the witness network we must do the following things:</p>



 
 Write witness configuration files ensuring the witnesses listen for incoming traffic on a set of TCP and HTTP ports. 



 Create the keystores for the witnesses using the KERI command line interface, the KLI, via <code>kli init</code> subcommand. 



 Start witnesses using the KLI via the <code>keri witness start</code> subcommand. 
 



<p>For the ATHENA witness network we create three separate witnesses as shown above on the following ports:</p>



 
 <code>wan</code>: TCP 5632 HTTP 5642 



 <code>wes</code>: TCP 5633 HTTP 5643 



 <code>wil</code>: TCP 5634 HTTP 5644 
 



 Building your own, non-demo witnesses and agents 



<p>In order for you to really understand the KERI KLI we do not want you to have to rely on any demo commands such as <code>kli witness demo</code> or <code>kli agent vlei</code> so we show you here how to use the keystore and witness commands directly.</p>



<p>First we address the writing of witness configuration files.</p>



 Witness Configuration files 



<p>Each witness on startup reads a witness configuration file. This file includes properties such as TCP and HTTP ports to listen on and any OOBIs to resolve at startup. See below for a witness configuration file example. The diagram shows the specific witness configuration file used for each specific witness.</p>


 
 


 Location and Directory Structure 



<p>JSON configuration files for KERI witnesses must be placed inside a particular directory structure. This directory structure is as follows<br><code>CONFIG_ROOT/keri/cf/main</code></p>


 
 


<p>The reason for this is that the KERI <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy/blob/446eca9a694166e24416221ec49736cb071cd790/src/keri/app/configing.py#L29">Configer module</a> uses the root path of “keri/cf” and the sub path of “main” as see in the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy/blob/446eca9a694166e24416221ec49736cb071cd790/src/keri/app/configing.py#L50">Configer.__init__</a> function. You can configure the CONFIG_ROOT directory path by customizing the <code>--config-dir</code> property though the <code>keri/cf/main</code> directory path will be created for you inside of the CONFIG_ROOT directory if they do not already exist.</p>



<p>Then, inside this <code>CONFIG_ROOT/keri/cf/main</code> directory you must place your witness configuration JSON files.</p>



 Witness Configuration File Contents 



<p>The contents of a witness configuration file look as follows:</p>



 <code>{
  "wan": {
    "dt": "2022-01-20T12:57:59.823350+00:00",
    "curls": ["tcp://127.0.0.1:5632/", "http://127.0.0.1:5642/"]
  },
  "dt": "2022-01-20T12:57:59.823350+00:00",
  "iurls": [
  ]
}</code> 



<p>There must be a key in the configuration object named the same as the value passed into the <code>--alias [alias]</code> property for the subsequent <code>kli witness start</code> command. This applies to KERIpy, the Python implementation of KERI and the reference implementation of the KERI and ACDC specification. </p>



<p>Refer specifically to KERIpy <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy/blob/446eca9a694166e24416221ec49736cb071cd790/src/keri/app/habbing.py#L971">habbing.pyL971</a> in the <code>reconfigure</code> function to see how the configuration file must have an appropriately named key. Keep in mind that this function documentation states that “Config file is meant to be read only at init not changed by app at run time” so you should make any changes to this configuration before the <code>kli witness start</code> commands are run since any changes during run time will not be recognized until the witness is stopped and then started again.</p>



<p>The values inside the configuration file are as follows. Sub-properties such as the “dt” property inside of “wan” are indicated with the dot notation.</p>



 
 “wan”: The named configuration block property for a given witness.
 
 “wan.dt”: The date-time stamp when the configuration was created. 



 “wan.curls”: Controller URLs. This is the list of URLs that indicate the protocol and ports for the witness to listen on. You can see both TCP port 5632 and HTTP port 5642 in the above example. 
 
 



 “dt”: The date and timestamp the configuration was created 



 “iurls”: Introduction URLs. This means any out of band introduction (OOBI) URLs to process and resolve on startup. 
 



<p>Other properties that are not shown above yet can be presented include:</p>



 
 “durls”: Data URLs. Another section for OOBI URLs to process. Typically you put credential OOBIs in this section you want the witness, really just a KERI controller, to resolve on startup. You could put these URLs in the “iurls” section as well. 



 “wurls”: Well-known OOBIs to resolve on startup. 
 



<p>With this explanation of how to write a witness configuration file you now can go make the other two witness configuration files for “wil” and “wes,” or you can pull them from the tutorial repo: <a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/tree/master/athena/conf/keri/cf/main">athena/conf/keri/cf/main/*.json</a></p>



 Witness Create Command: kli init 



<p>Next we must create the keystores. We will end up with the following three keystores:</p>


 
 


<p>We use the <code>kli init</code> command to create each of the keystores.</p>



<p>A witness requires a keystore to be created first in order to start the witness later. Do this with a command like the following:</p>



 <code>kli init --name wan --salt 0AB3YW5uLXRoZS13aXRuZXNz --nopasscode \
    --config-dir "${CONFIG_DIR}" \
    --config-file main/wan-witness</code> 



<p>You can see you must name the witness and pass in a configuration directory and file. The configuration file must have the “main/” path prefix on it since the underlying <code>Configer</code> class defaults the “base” path property to be “main” as seen on <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy/blob/446eca9a694166e24416221ec49736cb071cd790/src/keri/app/configing.py#L50">Configer:L50 here</a>. You don’t need to add the “.json” suffix since KERIpy will do that for you. The filename alone is sufficient.</p>



<p>Running this command will create output similar to the following:</p>



 <code>KERI Keystore created at: /Users/myuser/.keri/ks/wan
KERI Database created at: /Users/myuser/.keri/db/wan
KERI Credential Store created at: /Users/myuser/.keri/reg/wan</code> 



 Keystore Passcodes 



<p>Here I am not using any passcodes though you are free to modify the example to use them. The passcode is an additional layer of security used to unlock a keystore. Using a passcode would look like adding in a passcode argument like so: <code>--passcode DoB26Fj4x9LboAFWJra17O</code></p>



 For Each Witness 



<p>Write a configuration file for each of the three witnesses, wan, wil, and wes. You can use the <code>create_witnesses</code> function in the <code>workflow.sh</code> script as a guide. Place each of the JSON configuration files in your configuration directory with the appropriate directory suffix like so:<br><code>$CONFIG_DIR/keri/cf/main</code></p>



 Cryptographic Salts (seeds) 



<p>The salt used here is the same as both what is used in the Abydos Tutorial witness set as well as what is used for the demo command <code>kli witness demo</code> that starts six witnesses for you. Using the same salt means the keys generated from the salt will be the same. So you may conclude that protecting your salt is as important as protecting your keys themselves similar to protecting your Bitcoin or Ethereum seed phrase and private keys. </p>



<p>Whatever you do make sure your seeds do not get in the hands of people who shouldn’t have them and be sure to use highly secure deployment mechanisms to inject seeds into your witness, agent, and controller deployments.</p>



<p>Moving on, next we start the witness.</p>



 Witness Start Command: kli witness start 



<p>Starting a witness is very simple yet it does depend on code recently added to KERIpy to support the <code>--config-dir</code> and <code>--config-file</code> arguments so make sure you install the latest version of KERIpy from source with <code>python -m pip install -e ./</code> from the KERIpy repository root directory. This will give you at least KERIpy 1.0.0 release locally whether or not the release has been pushed to PyPi or GitHub yet.</p>



 <code>kli witness start --name wan --alias wan \
  -T ${WAN_WITNESS_TCP_PORT} \
  -H ${WAN_WITNESS_HTTP_PORT} \
  --config-dir "${CONFIG_DIR}" \
  --config-file wan-witness</code> 



<p>Ports and the alias name are a few additional configuration options here. Remember that the “alias” property must match the name used in the witness configuration file you wrote earlier in which you defined the TCP and HTTP endpoints for your witness to listen on. The other arguments are as they seem, -T for the TCP port and -H for the HTTP port the witness will listen on.</p>



<p>Run this command for each of the three witnesses wan, wil, and wes. You can use whatever ports you’d like though the ATHENA ports used are shown in the <a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/workflow.sh#L109">variables section</a> near the top of the <code>workflow.sh</code> script. </p>



<p>Running this command successfully will provide output similar to the following:</p>



 <code>Witness wan : BBilc4-L3tFUnfM_wJr4S4OJanAv_VmF_dJNN6vkf2Ha</code> 



<p>You can either do the commands by hand yourself or you can use the <code>workflow.sh</code> script to do it for you. It is recommended to get some practice yourself with the commands in order to learn them though you can start by reading the <code>start_witnesses</code> function in the <code>workflow.sh</code> script to see how the Abydos Tutorial starts the ATHENA witnesses. Be aware that BASH variables are used heavily throughout the script so you will need to refer often to the variables section at the top of the script in order to fully understand what each of the commands are doing.</p>



<p>Once you have all of the witnesses set up and started your next task is to set up the KERI controllers for Richard, Elayne, Ramiel, and Zaqiel. This involves writing a bootstrap configuration file which we get into next. </p>



 KERI Controller Setup 



<p>Creating and setting up controllers can happen in one of two ways, with the KERI command line, the KLI, or with the KERI Agent API (called the Mark I Agent, currently deprecated). The KLI method does not start a running process or daemon while the Agent runs as a daemon. An important note on the existing Agent API in KERIpy is that Agent API is now deprecated in favor  of the new Agent API being written as a separate deployable called <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keria">KERIA</a> (called the Mark II Agent). </p>



<p>While the existing Agent API is deprecated it is nonetheless useful to see how the KLI compares to using REST requests in the Agent API. You get an idea of how you might write your own API on top of a KERI controller or how you might contribute to the agent implementations. Once the Mark II Agent API is ready this article will be updated with the new API.</p>



<p>There are three general steps to setting up a controller:</p>



 
 Write the controller configuration file. 



 Initialize the controller’s keystore 



 Create the first keypair for the controller, called a prefix, by performing an inception event. This involves using an alias to label that particular prefix. 
 



<p>The KLI flow is shorter than the Agent flow though they both accomplish the same objective. You may follow along in the <code>workflow.sh</code> script with the code for setting up each of the four controllers in the following functions:</p>



 
 For the Agent flow <code>start_agents</code> starts up all needed agents. 



 <code>read_witness_prefixes_and_configure</code> updates the controller and agent bootstrap configuration files. 



 <code>make_keystores_and_incept_kli</code> and <code>make_keystores_and_incept_agent</code> perform the keystore creation and inception events using the KLI or Agent API, respectively. 
 



 Four Controllers 



<p>There are four controllers to be created, one each for Richard, Elayne, Ramiel, and Zaqiel. This involves writing configuration files with OOBIs for witnesses, and credential schemas, initializing controller keystores, performing the inception events, and, in the case of using agents, starting the KERI Agent for each controller. Below is a simplified diagram of the controllers and the out of OOBI connections that must be made between the controllers to support credential issuance and presentation.</p>


 
 


 Controller Bootstrap Configuration File 



<p>A bootstrap configuration file instructs a KERI controller what OOBI URLs to resolve on initial startup including both a list of controller OOBIs and a list of credential schema OOBIs. The list of controller OOBIs is usually a list of OOBIs for each witnesses that will be used to perform the inception event though it can be expanded to other controllers beyond the witness pool.</p>



<p>When first starting a controller it reads in the configuration file specified by the <code>--config-file</code> argument to either the <code>kli init</code> or <code>kli agent start</code> commands. Beware that the configuration file is not re-read on subsequent startups. If you need a controller to resolve more OOBIs after initial bootstrapping then use the <code>kli oobi resolve</code> command or equivalent Agent REST request.</p>



 Example Config 



<p>The example config file from the ATHENA network shows three controller OOBI URLs in “iurls” and four credential schema OOBI URLs in “durls”. Starting an agent also reads in a similar configuration file with OOBIs for the agent to resolve during initialization. Agents are covered in a later section.</p>



<p>Once you have all three prefixes for the witnesses you can make OOBIs and write them into configuration files for both KLI and Agent modes:</p>



 
 controller-oobi-bootstrap.json for the KLI mode
 
 Full path: abydos-tutorial/athena/conf/keri/cf/controller-oobi-bootstrap.json 
 
 



 agent-oobi-bootstrap.json for the Agent mode
 
 Full path: abydos-tutorial/athena/conf/keri/cf/agent-oobi-bootstrap.json 
 
 
 



<p>If you look into each of these two configuration files you will find their contents to be identical and will look very similar to the below:</p>



 <code>{
  "dt": "2022-01-20T12:57:59.823350+00:00",
  "iurls": [
    "http://127.0.0.1:5642/oobi/BBilc4-L3tFUnfM_wJr4S4OJanAv_VmF_dJNN6vkf2Ha",
    "http://127.0.0.1:5643/oobi/BLskRTInXnMxWaGqcpSyMgo0nYbalW99cGZESrz3zapM",
    "http://127.0.0.1:5644/oobi/BIKKuvBwpmDVA4Ds-EpL5bt9OqPzWPja2LigFYZN2YfX"
  ],
  "durls": [
    "http://127.0.0.1:7723/oobi/EIxAox3KEhiQ_yCwXWeriQ3ruPWbgK94NDDkHAZCuP9l",
    "http://127.0.0.1:7723/oobi/ELc8tMg_hhsAPfVbjUBBC-giEy5440oSb9EzFBZdAxHD",
    "http://127.0.0.1:7723/oobi/EBEefH4LNQswHSrXanb-3GbjCZK7I_UCL6BdD-zwJ4my",
    "http://127.0.0.1:7723/oobi/EEq0AkHV-i5-aCc1JMBGsd7G85HlBzI3BfyuS5lHOGjr"
  ]
}</code> 



<p>Next we learn how to write each of the two OOBI lists for both the “iurls” and the “durls” sections of the configuration files.</p>



 IURLS: Writing controller OOBIs for the “iurls” section 



<p>An OOBI URLs uses the following URL scheme:<br>“<code>[protocol]://[host]:[port]/oobi/[prefix]</code>“</p>



<p>The protocol is typically “http” though may be “tcp” as well. Host and port will be specific to your deployment. Creating a prefix involves many steps as shown in a later section. Without jumping ahead you can use the prefixes automatically created during the <code>kli witness start</code> command you ran earlier. This created a set of keystores which also created a set of prefixes for each witness. You can get the prefixes you created with the <code>kli status</code> command as shown below.</p>



 Prefixes with kli status 



<p>The prefix is the prefix of the first key in a sequence of KERI key creation events (establishment events). This is the same prefix that is added into the KERI DID generation function when you run <code>kli did generate</code>. To turn the prefix into a did you do as follows:<br><code>did:[prefix]</code><br>For example, using the first OOBI below, the corresponding DID would be:<br><code>did:keri:BBilc4-L3tFUnfM_wJr4S4OJanAv_VmF_dJNN6vkf2Ha</code></p>



<p>For now you can get the prefix with the <code>kli status command</code> as shown in the <code><a href="http://update_config_with_witness_oobis">read_witness_prefixes_and_configure</a></code> function in <code>workflow.sh</code>. Here is an example using <code>kli status</code> and AWK to store witness wan’s prefix in the <code>WAN_PREFIX</code> variable:</p>



 <code>WAN_PREFIX=$(kli status --name wan --alias wan | awk '/Identifier:/ {print $2}')
# Then do echo $WAN_PREFIX to see the value of the prefix
echo $WAN_PREFIX</code> 



<p>The <code><a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/workflow.sh#L352">update_config_with_witness_oobis</a></code> function does this for you in the <code>workflow.sh</code> script. Once you finish writing your witness OOBIs to the configuration file your “iurls” section should look like the following:</p>



 <code>{
  "dt": "2022-01-20T12:57:59.823350+00:00",
  "iurls": [
    "http://127.0.0.1:5642/oobi/BBilc4-L3tFUnfM_wJr4S4OJanAv_VmF_dJNN6vkf2Ha",
    "http://127.0.0.1:5643/oobi/BLskRTInXnMxWaGqcpSyMgo0nYbalW99cGZESrz3zapM",
    "http://127.0.0.1:5644/oobi/BIKKuvBwpmDVA4Ds-EpL5bt9OqPzWPja2LigFYZN2YfX"
  ],
  "durls": [
    ...
  ]
}</code> 



<p>Next we write the “durls” section for credential schema OOBIs. This enables controllers to recognize ACDC schemas by their SAID.</p>



 DURLS: WRITING credential schema OOBI URLs for the “durls” section 



<p>The four OOBIs in the “durls” are created by getting the “$id” properties from each of the schemas you created during the schema writing and linking step above with KASLCred. The scheme for data OOBIs is as follows:<br><code>[protocol]://[caching_server_host]:[caching_server_port]/oobi/[schema_said]</code></p>



<p>For example, “<code>EEq0AkHV-i5-aCc1JMBGsd7G85HlBzI3BfyuS5lHOGjr</code>” is the <code>[schema_said]</code> property for the OOBI url for the JourneyCharter OOBI URL. This. is pulled directly from the schema in <code>abydos-tutorial/athena/saidified_schemas/JourneyCharter__EEq0AkHV-i5-aCc1JMBGsd7G85HlBzI3BfyuS5lHOGjr.json</code></p>


 
 


<p>The resulting OOBI URL looks like the following:</p>



<p><code>"http://127.0.0.1:7723/oobi/EEq0AkHV-i5-aCc1JMBGsd7G85HlBzI3BfyuS5lHOGjr"</code></p>



<p>In this instance the caching server host and port correspond to the <code>vLEI-server</code> instance ATHENA defines in the <code>workflow.sh</code> script, or <code>http://127.0.0.1</code> and <code>7723</code>, respectively.</p>



<p>Once you have the OOBI URLs set up then write them into both the controller-oobi-bootstrap.json file and the “agent-oobi-bootstrap.json” files in the “$CONFIG_DIR/keri/cf” configuration directory. In the Abydos Tutorial the location “<code>abydos-tutorial/athena/conf/keri/cf</code>” is the $CONFIG_DIR configuration directory.</p>



<p>These files should look somewhat like the following once you are finished:</p>



 <code>{
  "dt": "2022-01-20T12:57:59.823350+00:00",
  "iurls": [
    "http://127.0.0.1:5642/oobi/BBilc4-L3tFUnfM_wJr4S4OJanAv_VmF_dJNN6vkf2Ha",
    "http://127.0.0.1:5643/oobi/BLskRTInXnMxWaGqcpSyMgo0nYbalW99cGZESrz3zapM",
    "http://127.0.0.1:5644/oobi/BIKKuvBwpmDVA4Ds-EpL5bt9OqPzWPja2LigFYZN2YfX"
  ],
  "durls": [
    "http://127.0.0.1:7723/oobi/EIxAox3KEhiQ_yCwXWeriQ3ruPWbgK94NDDkHAZCuP9l",
    "http://127.0.0.1:7723/oobi/ELc8tMg_hhsAPfVbjUBBC-giEy5440oSb9EzFBZdAxHD",
    "http://127.0.0.1:7723/oobi/EBEefH4LNQswHSrXanb-3GbjCZK7I_UCL6BdD-zwJ4my",
    "http://127.0.0.1:7723/oobi/EEq0AkHV-i5-aCc1JMBGsd7G85HlBzI3BfyuS5lHOGjr"
  ]
}</code> 



<p>Now that you have the controller and agent bootstrap configuration files set up we show how to start up agents with the KLI.</p>



 KERI Agents 



 KERI Agent Startup – Mark I agent (deprecated) 



<p>Creating and handling a controller with the KERI Mark I agent involves a four step process:</p>


 
 


 
 Start the agent with <code>kli agent start</code> 



 POST to /boot to initialize the keystore 



 PUT to /boot to unlock the keystore 



 POST to /ids/${ALIAS} to perform the inception event 
 



<p>There are four agents to be set up for the ATHENA network, one each for Richard, Elayne, Ramiel, and Zaqiel as shown below:</p>


 
 


 KERI Controller Agent Start (Mark I Agent – deprecated) 



<p>You will notice that the <code>--insecure</code> option is passed to the agent start command. This is because the first draft of a KERI Agent, the Mark I agent, has a partially complete HTTP signature signing scheme that currently does not function and thus must be disabled with the <code>--insecure</code> option. Without disabling this option you will not be able to communicate at all with a Mark I agent. The next version of KERI Agents is <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keria">KERIA</a>, the Mark II agent, and this has a fully complete HTTP signature signing scheme intended to work with <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/signify-ts">Signify</a>, a TypeScript edge signing library for KERI.</p>



<p>The <code>--path</code> option declares a directory to be served up at the <code>$AGENT_URL/static</code> HTTP endpoint though isn’t important for this tutorial. It was originally used to host Swagger API documentation for the Agent API.</p>



<p>All of the other configuration options are relatively straightforward.</p>



 
 <code>--config-dir</code> is the directory the agent bootstrap file will be located in
 
 Full path: abydos-tutorial/athena/conf/keri/cf 
 
 



 <code>--config-file</code> is the configuration file to be used
 
 agent-oobi-bootstrap.json for the Agent mode 



 Full path: abydos-tutorial/athena/conf/keri/cf/agent-oobi-bootstrap.json 
 
 



 <code>--tcp</code> is the TCP port to listen on 



 <code>--admin-http-port</code> is the HTTP port to listen on. This is the port we will be submitting all of our requests to. 
 



 <code>kli agent start --insecure \
  --admin-http-port ${EXPLORER_AGENT_HTTP_PORT} \
  --tcp ${EXPLORER_AGENT_TCP_PORT} \
  --config-dir ${CONFIG_DIR} \
  --config-file ${AGENT_CONFIG_FILENAME} \
  --path ${ATHENA_DIR}/agent_static</code> 



<p>Start up an Agent for each controller Richard, Elayne, Ramiel, and Zaqiel. The <a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/workflow.sh#L242"><code>start_agents</code></a> function in <code>workflow.sh</code> shows one way to do this.</p>



 Switching between the KLI and the KERI Agent API (Mark I – deprecated) 



<p>For the remainder of this tutorial we switch back and forth between the KERI command line interface, the KLI, and the KERI Agent HTTP API, the Mark I version in KERIpy, in order to present a broad understanding of both the ways you can interact with the KERI specification and the work that has been completed in the space. This will provide an opportunity to understand both how the command line interaction looks as well as how a REST API addressing a similar purpose feels and looks.</p>



<p>Each task will be completed first with the KLI and then with the KERI Agent API. The KLI is always up to date with the latest and greatest code in KERIpy. The KERI Agent API will likely eventually be removed from KERIpy once the Mark II agent in <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keria">KERIA</a> is finished. At present the KERI Agent API in the KERIpy repository is now deprecated and is referred to as the Mark I agent.</p>



<p>For our next task of creating keystores we start first with the KERI Command Line Interface (KLI) to initialize the keystores for all of the participants in this journey including the ATHENA officials and the two explorers. After showing how to accomplish this task with the KLI we switch to perform the same task with the Agent API.</p>



 Use one or the other for keystores and inception 



<p>Make sure to either use the KLI or the Agent API to perform keystore creation and inception, not both. You only need to create the keystores once whether your use the KLI or the Agent API.</p>



<p>If you don’t know which one you want or need for your scenario then start with the KLI.</p>



 KERI Keystores and Inception 



 KERI Controller Keystore Create – KLI INIT 



<p>There are four keystores to initialize. We will show here the commands to initialize one of the keystores. After performing this command you can initialize all of the other keystores yourself with similar commands for each keystore or use the <code>make_keystores_and_incept_kli</code> function in the <code>workflow.sh</code> script.</p>


 
 


 Salts 



<p>The cryptographic salt is one of the arguments to <code>kli init</code>. This salt is what all of the private keys are derived from so it should be protected as if you were protecting your personal identity documents or your bank account. You can get your own salt with the <code>kli salt</code> command:</p>



 <code>$ kli salt
0ACPpGmPWX9LqRlUCOLH3qk2</code> 



<p>You can use the salt in any <code>--salt</code> argument via the KLI or a <code>"salt"</code> property of a Agent request.</p>



 Command 



<p>The other arguments are straightforward, nopasscode, config-dir, and config-file. <code>--nopasscode</code> indicates that there is no passcode to access this keystore. </p>



<p>The <code>--config-dir</code> property indicates the directory in which to look for configuration files. Inside this configuration directory the file name from the <code>--config-file</code> option is used to find and select the controller bootstrap configuration file that will be used to initialize this keystore. This option does not need to have a file extension if your configuration file already ends with the “.json” extension.</p>



 <code>kli init --name ${EXPLORER_KEYSTORE} --salt "${EXPLORER_SALT}" \
  --nopasscode \
  --config-dir "${CONFIG_DIR}" \
  --config-file "${CONTROLLER_BOOTSTRAP_FILE}"</code> 



<p>This command sets up all of the <a href="http://www.lmdb.tech/doc/">Lightning Memory Mapped Database</a> instances used by the keystore. These are located in the $HOME/.keri directory.</p>



 KERI Controller AID (Prefix) Create and Incept – KLI INCEPT 



<p>Now the keystore is ready to have a specific key pair created and an inception event performed. This will begin the key event log (KEL) for that key pair. Key pairs are referred to with a label called an “alias.” This alias label is intended to be more human-friendly and is used throughout both the KLI and the Agent API to refer to the key pair.</p>



 Alias vs Prefix 



<p>Aliases are used to refer to key pairs since prefixes, the internal reference to key pairs, are not human friendly. For example, an alias can be a word or set of words like “richard” and a prefix looks like the following: <code>"EJS0-vv_OPAQCdJLmkd5dT0EW-mOfhn_Cje4yzRjTv8q"</code>. As you can see you won’t be remembering many prefixes which is why the alias system is so helpful.</p>



 Steps to Inception 



<p>Performing an inception event, once the keystore is initialized, requires the following two steps:</p>



 
 Write an inception configuration file. 



 Execute the inception command whether from the command line or the Agent REST API
 
 For the KLI you will provide the inception configuration file as an argument. 



 For the Agent API you will provide the inception configuration as JSON in the body of the inception HTTP request. 
 
 
 



<p>Four inception events need to be performed on each of the four keystores. Each inception event begins a <a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#7c43">key event log</a> (KEL), as shown below:</p>


 
 


<p>First we write the inception configuration file.</p>



 Writing a Controller Inception Configuration File 



<p>Each attribute of a controller inception configuration file is important. The initial set of witnesses, keypair counts, key thresholds, transferability, and threshold of acceptable duplicity are all defined in this file. </p>



<p>The following is the inception configuration file used for each of the controllers we create for the Abydos journey:</p>



 <code>{
  "transferable": true,
  "wits": [
    "BBilc4-L3tFUnfM_wJr4S4OJanAv_VmF_dJNN6vkf2Ha",
    "BLskRTInXnMxWaGqcpSyMgo0nYbalW99cGZESrz3zapM",
    "BIKKuvBwpmDVA4Ds-EpL5bt9OqPzWPja2LigFYZN2YfX"
  ],
  "toad": 3,
  "icount": 1,
  "ncount": 1,
  "isith": "1",
  "nsith": "1"
}</code> 



 Witness configuration file attributes 



<p>Now an explanation of each attribute, which may also be seen in <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy/blob/446eca9a694166e24416221ec49736cb071cd790/src/keri/app/habbing.py#L888">keripy/src/keri/app/habbing.pyL873</a> and in <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy/blob/446eca9a694166e24416221ec49736cb071cd790/src/keri/app/cli/common/incepting.py#L9">keripy/src/keri/app/cli/common/incepting.pyL9</a>:</p>



 
 “transferable” – <a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#7344">Transferability</a> refers to whether a KERI autonomic identifier (AID) can have its keys rotated. Technically this refers to having what is called “control authority” changed, control over the private keypairs linked to a KERI AID. <br>When true this means the AID is a transferable AID.<br>When false this means the AID is non-transferable. 



 “wits”: Witnesses – A list of prefixes identifying the witnesses to include signatures for in the inception event in this controller’s key event log. 



 “toad”: Threshold of acceptable duplicity – The number of agreeing witnesses receipts at or above which the controller accepts accountability for signed key events. Accountability is not accepted by the controller for key events with a number of signatures below this threshold. 



 “icount”: Inception signature count – The number of keys used to sign the inception event. 



 “ncount”: Number of rotation signatures count – The number of keys to be used on the next key rotation event. Note that not all pre-rotated keys committed to in the inception event as described <a href="https://weboftrust.github.io/ietf-keri/draft-ssmith-keri.html#name-reserve-rotation">Reserve Rotation</a>. 



 “isith”: Signing threshold for the inception event – The number of key event receipts from distinct witnesses the Inception Event must have in order to be authoritative. 



 “nsith”: Signing threshold for the next rotation event – The number of key event receipts from distinct witnesses the next Rotation Event must have in order to be authoritative. 
 



 Writing your configuration 



<p>For all except the “wits” section you can copy and paste the configuration file as-is. The “wits” section contains the AID prefixes that will be specific to your witnesses. If you are using the <code>workflow.sh</code> script with precisely the same salts, witness keystore names, and witness AID aliases, then you can use the configuration from above.</p>



<p>Place all of your configuration in a JSON file in a configuration directory you will remember the location of that you can reference when passing in the <code>--file</code> argument to the <code>kli incept</code> command below. In the Abydos Tutorial repo this path is “<code>abydos-tutorial/conf/inception-config.json</code>“.</p>



 Performing Inception – KLI INCEPT 



<p>Incepting a keypair consists of:</p>



 
 Creating the number of cryptographic key pairs as indicated in the “icount” configuration property. 



 Creating the number of pre-rotated cryptographic key pairs as indicated in the “ncount” configuration property. 



 Creating a valid, properly formatted inception event signed by all of the keys included in the “icount” set. 



 Adding that inception event to the controller’s key event log. 



 Sending the inception event to each witness in set of witnesses configured in the inception configuration you wrote above. <br>The set of witnesses is defined in the configuration file passed to the <code>--file</code> argument. 



 Receiving key event receipts (KERs) of the inception event from each witness. 



 Adding the key event receipts from the witnesses to the key event receipt log (KERL) for the controller.  
 



<p>All of these steps are performed for you when you execute the <code>kli incept</code> command. The below example from <code>workflow.sh</code> shows the inception of Richard’s AID:</p>



 <code>kli incept --name ${EXPLORER_KEYSTORE} --alias ${EXPLORER_ALIAS} \
  --file "${CONTROLLER_INCEPTION_CONFIG_FILE}"</code> 



<p>Repeat this procedure for each Elayne, Ramiel, and Zaqiel with the keystore and alias names indicated in the BASH variables at the top of the <code>workflow.sh</code> script in the <a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial">Abydos Tutorial repository</a>.</p>



<p>Next, for those who are using agents, we show how to use the KERI Mark I Agent to perform keystore setup and inception.</p>



 KERI Controller Keystore Create – Agent (Mark I – deprecated) 



<p>Keep in mind that you only need to create the keystores once whether you create the keystores with the KLI or the Agent API. Only proceed to create the keystores and perform inception with the Agent API if you have not already done so with the KLI.</p>



<p>Setting up a KERI controller keystore and AID with an agent involves the following three REST requests:</p>



 
 POST to <code>/boot</code> to initialize the keystore
 
 This is similar to the <code>kli init</code> command. 
 
 



 PUT to <code>/boot</code> to unlock the keystore
 
 This does not have a direct analogue with the KLI though the <code>--passcode</code> argument used with <code>kli init</code>, <code>kli incept</code>, and many other KLI commands serves a similar purpose. 
 
 



 POST to <code>/ids/${ALIAS}</code> to perform the inception event
 
 This is similar to the <code>kli incept</code> command. 
 
 
 



<p>Data in the request bodies for each of these requests is very similar to the command line argument data for each of the corresponding commands using the KLI.</p>



 curl Common Headers, arguments, and pipes 



 Headers 



<p>The “Accept: */*” and “Content-Type: application/json” HTTP headers are common to all of the commands used in the <code>workflow.sh</code> scripts.</p>



 Arguments 



<p>The “-s” argument to cURL is the “silent” option and ensures that only the response body of the target HTTP request is sent to the standard output channel.</p>



<p>The backslash <a href="https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html#Escape-Character">“\” escape character</a> is often used in BASH scripts to make commands more readable by enabling splitting of the commands across multiple lines.</p>



 Pipes 



<p>jq: Heavy usage of the <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a> program, a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON parser, is made throughout this tutorial. Most often the results of a cURL command will be piped to the jq program and then the jq program will select an attribute from the response  body using a selector expression like <code>'.["msg"]'</code> in the example below.</p>



<p>tr: Frequently the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tr_(Unix)">tr</a> program is used to trim double quotes off of the JSON output returned from the jq program. As seen in the example below tr is used with the <code>-d</code> flag to delete all tokens of the specified set from input. This is needed since often the value of a cURL request needs to be placed in a BASH variable and the extra quotes returned along with the JSON body are problematic to deal with an so it is easier to remove them altogether.</p>



<p>Both jq and tr are often used together in a sequence as shown below.</p>



 <code>...(more code causing JSON to be sent to standard out)... \
| jq '.["msg"]' | tr -d '"'</code> 



 KERI Controller Keystore Create – Agent 



<p>This operation is a POST to the <code>/boot</code> endpoint which creates a keystore where the body is a JSON object with the value placed in the “name” property of the JSON body used to name the keystore. The “salt” value is the cryptographic salt used as the cryptographic seed to derive all key pairs in the keystore. You can use the <code>kli salt</code> command to generate a new salt.</p>



<p>The <code>${EXPLORER_AGENT_URL}</code> is define on <a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/workflow.sh#L127">Line 127 of workflow.sh</a> and looks like this:<br><a href="http://127.0.0.1:5620">http://127.0.0.1:5620</a></p>



 <code>curl -s -X POST "${EXPLORER_AGENT_URL}/boot" \
  -H 'accept: */*' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data "{\"name\": \"${EXPLORER_KEYSTORE}\",
           \"salt\": \"${EXPLORER_SALT}\"}" \
  | jq '.["msg"]' | tr -d '"'</code> 



<p>As you can see the “name” and “salt” options are similar to the similarly named arguments to KLI init. The difference here is that they are in the body of the POST request as JSON. The result is piped to “jq” and then “tr” to extract and print the result message to the terminal.</p>



<p>Next the keystore must be unlocked.</p>



 KERI Controller Keystore Unlock – Agent 



<p>Unlocking a keystore is a PUT to the <code>/boot</code> endpoint using the same JSON body as was POSTed to initialize the keystore. This is used to permit a particular Agent to work with a specified keystore. This is useful because an agent may have been restarted after initializing the keystore and so the Agent must establish an authenticated connection to the keystore.</p>



 <code>curl -s -X PUT "${EXPLORER_AGENT_URL}/boot" \
  -H 'accept: */*' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data "{\"name\": \"${EXPLORER_KEYSTORE}\",
           \"salt\": \"${EXPLORER_SALT}\"}" \
  | jq '.["msg"]' | tr -d '"'</code> 



<p>Next the keystore is ready to have an AID, also known as a prefix, created and incepted.</p>



 KERI Controller AID (Prefix) Create and Incept – Agent 



<p>Creating an AID requires submitting a POST request to the <code>/ids/{alias}</code> path of a controller agent. The body of the request is the same controller inception configuration file you wrote earlier when performing <code>kli incept</code>. The file is reproduced below for reference:</p>



 Inception Configuration File 



 <code>{
  "transferable": true,
  "wits": [
    "BBilc4-L3tFUnfM_wJr4S4OJanAv_VmF_dJNN6vkf2Ha",
    "BLskRTInXnMxWaGqcpSyMgo0nYbalW99cGZESrz3zapM",
    "BIKKuvBwpmDVA4Ds-EpL5bt9OqPzWPja2LigFYZN2YfX"
  ],
  "toad": 3,
  "icount": 1,
  "ncount": 1,
  "isith": "1",
  "nsith": "1"
}</code> 



<p>The contents of this file are placed in the body of the HTTP request as submitted below:</p>



 <code>curl -s -X POST "${EXPLORER_AGENT_URL}/ids/${EXPLORER_ALIAS}" \
  -H 'accept: */*' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data @${CONTROLLER_INCEPTION_CONFIG_FILE} \
  | jq '.["d"]' | tr -d '"'</code> 



<p>The jq and tr pipes here select the AID prefix that comes in the response body of the request. You can see on <a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/workflow.sh#L471">Line 471 of workflow.sh</a> this sequence is used to capture Richard’s prefix and store it in the <code>RICHARD_PREFIX</code> bash variable.</p>



 Keystore and Inception Review 



<p>Once you get the hang of creating keystores and performing inception events then you will see the similarities between the KLI and the Agent API. When you have finished creating all of the keystores you need, one each for the Explorer, Librarian, Wise Man, and Gatekeeper, then you are ready to move on to the next step for connecting all of the agents together using out of band introductions, or OOBIs.</p>



 Out of Band Introductions (OOBIs) Between Controllers 



<p>Routes in a routing table or DNS entries are internet discovery system analogues to help understand the purpose out of band introductions. ATHENA requires a number of components in the Abydos network to talk to each other and thus an OOBI must be created or “resolved” for each connection between components.</p>


 
 


<p>You can think of an OOBI as an address with a role for one controller to contact either another controller or a KERI resource such as a credential schema. In order for one controller to be able to issue a credential to another controller it must know where that other controller is. The role</p>



<p>For example, in the diagram above, in order for Ramiel to issue the TreasureHuntingJourney credential to Richard he must have an OOBI that shows the location of Richard that includes a witness for Richard. This witness is necessary so Ramiel can verify that the KEL sent from Richard matches up to the AID prefix included in the OOBI URL. component that knows Richard. In this case that is the “wan” witness</p>



 OOBIs described 



<p>Out of band introductions (OOBIs) are the discovery mechanism for KERI controllers and KERI objects such as ACDC Schemas or cached ACDCs. OOBIs tell one controller how to reach another controller or object and are identified both by an AID prefix as well as an alias label.</p>



<p>The terminology “out-of-band” here refers to the fact that the general purpose internet infrastructure like IP routers, gateways, and DNS servers, are not part of KERI and are thus out-of-band with respect to KERI. The primary advantage to using this general purpose infrastructure for service discovery means KERI doesn’t have to provide it’s own discovery mechanism since it can piggy back on the existing internet infrastructure.</p>



<p>Discovery over the internet includes endpoint discovery of witnesses, watchers, and other network participants including <a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#285f">jurors</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#28f1">judges</a> (not yet implemented). According to the <a href="https://weboftrust.github.io/ietf-oobi/draft-ssmith-oobi.html">Out-Of-Band-Introduction (OOBI) Protocol</a> specification:</p>



<blockquote><p>[OOBIs provide] a discovery mechanism that associates a given URI or URL with a given AID (Autonomic IDentifier) or SAID (Self-Addressing IDentifier)&nbsp;[<a href="https://weboftrust.github.io/ietf-oobi/draft-ssmith-oobi.html#KERI_ID">KERI_ID</a>][<a href="https://weboftrust.github.io/ietf-oobi/draft-ssmith-oobi.html#KERI">KERI</a>][<a href="https://weboftrust.github.io/ietf-oobi/draft-ssmith-oobi.html#SAID_ID">SAID_ID</a>][<a href="https://weboftrust.github.io/ietf-oobi/draft-ssmith-oobi.html#OOBI_ID">OOBI_ID</a>]. The URI provided by an OOBI acts as a service endpoint for the discovery of verifiable information about the AID or SAID. As such an OOBI itself is not trusted but must be verified.</p>Out-Of-Band-Introduction (OOBI) Protocol IETF Draft specification – S. M. smith</blockquote>



<p>In the specification the usage of the terms “endpoint” or “service endpoint” just mean the URL to use to access some KERI resource.</p>



 OOBIs must be verified 



<p>The above quote draws attention to the fact that that OOBI URLs themselves are not trustable and must be verified. What does this mean? What is being verified? Since OOBI URLs merely point to a controller’s AID (prefix) the OOBU must be used to retrieve the full key event log from that controller referenced by the prefix. This key event log is then verified using the witness identified by the witness prefix at the end of the OOBI, in the case of a witness OOBI. If the controller proves control over the key referenced by the KEL then the verifier of the OOBI can then trust they have securely discovered the controller referenced by the OOBI.</p>



<p>A witness OOBI looks like the following example:</p>



 <code>"http://127.0.0.1:5642/oobi/EJS0-vv_OPAQCdJLmkd5dT0EW-mOfhn_Cje4yzRjTv8q/witness/BBilc4-L3tFUnfM_wJr4S4OJanAv_VmF_dJNN6vkf2Ha"</code> 



<p>The template for this OOBI URL is as follows:</p>



 <code>[proto]://[wit host]:[wit port]/oobi/[controller prefix]/[role]/[wit prefix]</code> 



 OOBIs may have roles 



<p>This is an OOBI that shows a witness for a given prefix. This type of OOBI includes a “witness” role and a witness prefix. This witness prefix corresponds to the witness host and port earlier in the OOBI URL. This witness will have a full key event log of all of that controller’s key events and thus can be used to verify that the controller’s KEL matches to the controller prefix included in the OOBI URL. This verification process is a part of what is known as “resolving” an OOBI.</p>



<p>See <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy/blob/446eca9a694166e24416221ec49736cb071cd790/src/keri/kering.py#L23">kering.py:L23</a> for a full list of other OOBI roles including controller, witness, registrar, watcher, judge, juror, peer, mailbox, and agent, at present.</p>



 Richard to Ramiel OOBIs – pairwise exchange 



<p>The following modified OOBI diagram shows greater detail of what the OOBIs exchanged between Richard and Ramiel look like. Since both Ramiel and Richard exchange OOBIs with each other this is called a pairwise OOBI exchange.</p>


 
 


<p>Since both witness OOBIs use the “wan” witness to resolve key state they have a secondary arrow pointing to wan in addition to their primary arrow to indicate this relationship.</p>



<p>In general, each controller wanting to communicate with another controller must resolve an OOBI with the target controller that describes where the controller is located over the internet so that the source controller can send messages to that destination controller. </p>



<p>In the case of Ramiel an OOBI must be resolved for both Elayne and Richard in order for Ramiel to issue the TreasureHuntingJourney credential to them. Similarly, Elayne and Richard both must resolve an OOBI that describes where Ramiel is located over the internet. All of these introductions are performed in both the <code><a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/workflow.sh#L525">make_introductions_kli</a></code> and <code><a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/workflow.sh#L581">make_introductions_agent</a></code> functions in the <code>workflow.sh</code> script.</p>



 Abydos OOBIs 



<p>The journey to Abydos requires that each controller is known for a certain reason. These reasons may include:</p>



 
 Credential Issuance: an issuing controller must have an OOBI for the isuee’s controller who will receive the credential. This is the case when Ramiel needs to issue the TreasureHuntingJourney credential to both Richard and Elayne. Likewise, Richard must know how to contact Ramiel in order to issue him the JourneyMarkRequest credential. 



 Credential Presentation: a credential holding controller must have the OOBI for the target node they will be sending a credential presentation to so that the presentation can reach the intended destination. This is the case when Richard and Elayne want to send the JourneyCharter credential to Zaqiel in order to be permitted entrance into Abydos. 
 



<p>These OOBI introductions are the controller-to-controller OOBIs needed during network operation. Keep in mind that there were OOBIs resolved in network setup and configuration for each of the witnesses as well as the four credential schemas used.</p>



<p>Use the commands below to perform all of the needed OOBI introductions as indicated on the graphic below.</p>


 
 


 Controller Introductions – KLI 



<p>Using the KLI to resolve a witness OOBI for a controller involves</p>



 
 specifying the target keystore with the <code>--name</code> argument,  



 setting an OOBI alias with the <code>--oobi-alias</code> property and  



 passing in a witness OOBI to the <code>--oobi</code> argument as shown below. 
 



 <code>kli oobi resolve --name ${WISEMAN_KEYSTORE} \
  --oobi-alias ${EXPLORER_ALIAS} \
  --oobi ${WAN_WITNESS_URL}/oobi/${RICHARD_PREFIX}/witness/${WAN_PREFIX}</code> 



<p>An OOBI resolution is a very simple operation and produces output similar to the following:</p>



 <code>http://127.0.0.1:5642/oobi/EJS0-vv_OPAQCdJLmkd5dT0EW-mOfhn_Cje4yzRjTv8q/witness/BBilc4-L3tFUnfM_wJr4S4OJanAv_VmF_dJNN6vkf2Ha resolved</code> 



 Controller Introductions – Agent (Mark I – deprecated) 



<p>Using the Agent API to resolve an OOBI is very similar to the KLI. All the properties are passed in through the HTTP request body as a JSON object as shown below.</p>



 <code>curl -s -X POST "${WISEMAN_AGENT_URL}/oobi" \
  -H "accept: */*" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"oobialias\": \"${EXPLORER_ALIAS}\",       
       \"url\":\"${WAN_WITNESS_URL}/oobi/${RICHARD_PREFIX}/witness/${WAN_PREFIX}\"}" \
  | jq</code> 



<p>This should result in a 202 HTTP status code when successful.</p>



<p>Once you have performed all OOBI creations for the controllers as depicted in the diagram above then move on to creating credential registries.</p>



 Credential Registries 


 
 


<p>In order to issue credentials from one controller to the next a credential registry must exist in both the issuing controller’s keystore to create and issue the credential from as well as in the receiving controller’s (issuee’s) keystore to receive the issued credential. This requires adding a new concept to manage the credential registry as well as any credentials issued from the registry. Enter the transaction event log <a href="https://github.com/trustoverip/acdc/wiki/transaction-event-log">transaction event log</a> (TEL).</p>



 Transaction Event Logs (TELs) 



<p>A transaction event log is a log of all events occurring for a verifiable credential or a credential registry that manages verifiable credentials. All TEL events are anchored in a KEL in either <code>ixn</code> (interaction) or <code>rot</code> (rotation) events. This is the foundation enabling a verifiable credential protocol to be built on top of KERI. This protocol is known as the authentic chained data container, or ACDC protocol. See the <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/draft-ssmith-acdc.html">ACDC specification</a> for a complete description of this protocol.</p>



<p>Two further sub-protocols within the ACDC paradigm further elaborate on creating registries and handling the verifiable credential lifecycle. These are the Public Transaction Event Logs (PTEL) and the Issuance and Presentation Exchange (IPEX) protocols. </p>



 Public Transaction Event Logs (PTEL) protocol 



<p>PTEL has two major parts the first being the details of using transaction event logs (TELs) to connect ACDCs to key event logs (KELs) and the second being the handling of events in the lifecycle of a credential including issuance and revocation. </p>



<p>There are two types of TELs:</p>



 
 A <a href="https://weboftrust.github.io/ietf-ptel/draft-pfeairheller-ptel.html#name-management-tel">management TEL</a> for managing an ACDC (credential) registry and tracks the list of Registrars that will act as Backers for individual TELs for each verifiable credential (VC). 



 A <a href="https://weboftrust.github.io/ietf-ptel/draft-pfeairheller-ptel.html#name-verifiable-credential-tels">Verifiable Credential TEL</a> (VC TEL) for managing the issued and revoked state of an individual ACDC. The VC TEL also contains a reference to its corresponding management TEL. There are only two events in a VC TEL which are the issuance and then a subsequent revocation, if ever. 
 



<p>PTEL describes the details of transaction event logs. The following introduction from the <a href="https://weboftrust.github.io/ietf-ptel/draft-pfeairheller-ptel.html">PTEL specification</a> summarizes well the purpose of transaction event logs:</p>



<blockquote><p>The&nbsp;Transaction Event Log&nbsp;(TEL) is a hash linked data structure of transactions that can be used to track state. A&nbsp;Public Verifiable Credential Registry&nbsp;can be represented in several TELs to establish issuance or revocation state of a Verifiable Credential (VC). The KEL is used to establish control authority over the keys used to commit to the events of the TEL and sign the VC. The events of the TEL are used to establish the issuance or revocation state of the VCs issued by the controller of the identifier represented by the KEL.</p>Public Transaction Event Logs (PTEL) IETF Draft Specification – P. Feairheller</blockquote>



 Issuance and Presentation Exchange (IPEX) protocol 



<p>Building upon the PTEL specification IPEX describes what happens between credential registries. This protocol defines the disclosure workflow events used to share information between the Discloser and the Disclosee.</p>



<blockquote><p>The Issuance and Presentation Exchange (IPEX) Protocol provides a uniform mechanism for the issuance and presentation of ACDCs&nbsp;[<a href="https://weboftrust.github.io/ietf-ipex/draft-ssmith-ipex.html#ACDC-ID">ACDC-ID</a>]&nbsp;in a securely attributable manner.</p>Issuance and Presentation Exchange Protocol IETF Draft specification – S. M. Smith, P. Feairheller</blockquote>



 Registry Creation 


 
 


<p>A registry creation event occurs in a TEL and has the type <code>vcp</code>. See the “<a href="https://weboftrust.github.io/ietf-ptel/draft-pfeairheller-ptel.html#name-verifiable-credential-regis">Verifiable Credential Registry</a>” section of the PTEL specification for a complete description of TEL event types. To avoid overburdening the diagram below the individual <code>ixn</code> events for each credential issuance are not included in the KEL nor are the <code>iss</code> events included in the TELs. The blue credential graphic to the right is used on successive versions of the diagram to represent credential issuances.</p>



<p>The below diagram shows the registry creation event as an interaction event in the KEL of each controller as well as the corresponding TEL created to manage the creation of each credential issued by or to each controller. </p>


 
 


<p>The IN column in a TEL indicates credentials the controller has received.<br>The OUT column in a TEL indicates credentials the controller has issued.</p>



<p>Both of these columns start out empty and will be filled as credentials are issued.</p>



 Registry Creation – KLI 



<p>All that is needed to create a registry is:</p>



 
 a keystore name with the <code>--name</code> argument to select the keystore to create the registry inside of, 



 an alias with the <code>--alias</code> argument to select the AID to use to issue credentials from that registry, 



 and the name of the registry with the <code>--registry-name</code> argument. 
 



 <code>kli vc registry incept --name ${EXPLORER_KEYSTORE} \
  --alias ${EXPLORER_ALIAS} \
  --registry-name ${EXPLORER_REGISTRY}</code> 



<p>This creates a registry named by the <code>--registry-name</code> argument value with a management TEL. The registry’s management TEL will be used to keep track of the backers for each credential.</p>



<p>Additional arguments accepted by the command not shown above include:</p>



 
 <code>--nonce</code>: unique random value to seed the credential registry. 



 <code>--no-backers</code>: boolean to not allow setting up backers different from the anchoring KEL. 



 <code>--establishment-only</code>: boolean to only allow establishment events for the anchoring of events in this registry. 



 <code>--backers</code>: the new set of backers different from the anchoring KEL witnesses to be used when setting backers for credentials from this registry. Can appear multiple times. 



 <code>--base</code>, <code>--alias</code>, and <code>--passcode</code> like the <code>kli init</code> and <code>kli incept</code> commands. 
 



<p>There is no TOAD (threshold of acceptable duplicity) argument for the KLI since as of March 2023 it has not been needed nor has the external backer feature been used or tested in production. Nonetheless a default TOAD is computed based on the length of the backer list sent in as you can see on <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy/blob/446eca9a694166e24416221ec49736cb071cd790/src/keri/vdr/eventing.py#L95">Line 95 of eventing.py</a>. If you need this feature then be sure to open an issue on the KERIpy GitHub repo and attend a <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keri#meetings">community dev meeting</a> (every other Tuesday at 8 AM UTC-6 DST / UTC-7 Non-DST).</p>



 Registry Creation – Agent (Mark I – deprecated) 



<p>Creating a registry using the Agent API is similar to the KLI except that the values passed as arguments to <code>kli vc registry incept</code> are instead located in the body as a JSON object.</p>



 <code>curl -s -X POST "${EXPLORER_AGENT_URL}/registries" \
  -H "accept: */*" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"alias\":\"${EXPLORER_ALIAS}\",
       \"baks\": [],
       \"estOnly\":false,
       \"name\":\"${EXPLORER_REGISTRY}\",
       \"noBackers\":true,
       \"toad\":0}" \
  | jq</code> 



<p>Once again here the output is piped to “jq” though this is only to make the response easy on the eyes.</p>



<p>Next we move to one of the most exciting parts of this journey, the issuing of credentials!</p>



 Credential Issuance 


 
 


<p>Value generation from the entire decentralized identity space centers around verifiable credentials. Wrap some data attributes in a container defined by a schema and you now have a verifiable bearer instrument that is a part of your digital reputation. A credential is the fundamental unit, or currency, of reputation. </p>



 Name – Why ACDC? 



<p>Now where does the name authentic chained data container come from and how did it get attached to the verifiable credential space? Three points make this clear:</p>



 
 Since ACDC-style credentials are verifiable as authentic using the KERI decentralized key management infrastructure (DKMI), 



 since ACDC-style credentials can be easily chained as a directed, acyclic graph (DAG),  



 and since the schema of an ACDC creates a shape or container for data,  
 



<p>you can see how those concepts combined to create the name (1) authentic (2) chained (3) data container, or ACDC.</p>



 Purpose 



<p>The introductory quote from the ACDC spec sums up well the purpose of the ACDC protocol:</p>



<blockquote><p>One primary purpose of the ACDC protocol is to provide granular provenanced proof-of-authorship (authenticity) of their contained data via a tree or chain of linked ACDCs (technically a directed acyclic graph or DAG). Similar to the concept of a chain-of-custody, ACDCs provide a verifiable chain of proof-of-authorship of the contained data. […] <br><br>These proofs of authorship and/or authority provide provenance of an ACDC itself and by association any data that is so conveyed.</p>Authentic Chained Data Containers IETF Draft Specification – Dr. Samuel M. Smith</blockquote>



<p>Verifiable authorizations, permissions, rights, and credentials that include a full provenance chain anchored in key event logs make KERI an elegant way to capture and unlock reputation value as well as serve as a robust solution for identity and access management systems.</p>



<p>To learn in-depth about all the particulars for ACDCs read the <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/draft-ssmith-acdc.html">Authentic Chained Data Containers (ACDC) IETF draft specification</a> by Dr. Samuel M. Smith.</p>



<p>With this brief interlude on the name and purpose of ACDCs out of the way next we dive into the specific credentials we will issue for the journey to Abydos.</p>



 Credentials for Abydos 



<p>Multiple different credentials are issued during different parts of the overall ATHENA trust workflow in the journey to Abydos. The following graphic shows a small blue icon representing each issued (OUT) or received (IN) credential.</p>


 
 


<p>The four credentials that will be issued over the course of the journey include:</p>



 
 TreasureHuntingJourney: this is issued by the Wise Man to each of the explorers, Richard and Elayne, to tell them about a potential journey they could go on. It represents a commitment by ATHENA to a potential explorer as an offer of a journey they could embark upon. 



 JourneyMarkRequest: this is issued by an explorer to the Wise Man as a commitment to join the party for a particular TreasureHuntingJourney. Both Richard and Elayne issue this to Ramiel. 



 JourneyMark: this is issued by the Wise Man to an explorer as an acknowledgment that ATHENA accepted that explorer onto the requested TreasureHuntingJourney. This is issued by Ramiel to both Richard and Elayne. 



 JourneyCharter: once the party threshold for a journey is reached (threshold logic not yet implemented) the Wise Man issues a JourneyCharter credential to each party member who will be going on the journey. This includes Richard and Elayne. 
 



<p>On to our first credential!</p>



 Issue TreasureHuntingJourney Credential – KLI 



<p>The TreasureHuntingJourney must be issued to both Richard and Elayne as depicted in the graphic below. </p>


 
 


<p>As you see Ramiel has both of these credentials in the OUT column to indicate he has issued these credentials and both Richard and Elayne have them in the IN column indicating they have received these credentials.</p>



<p>The following command shows issuance of this credential to Richard.</p>



 <code>kli vc issue --name ${WISEMAN_KEYSTORE} \
  --alias ${WISEMAN_ALIAS} \
  --registry-name ${WISEMAN_REGISTRY} \
  --schema "${TREASURE_HUNTING_JOURNEY_SCHEMA_SAID}" \
  --recipient "${RICHARD_PREFIX}" \
  --data @"${ATHENA_DIR}"/credential_data/osireion-treasure-hunting-journey.json</code> 



<p>This shows issuance of a credential:</p>



 
 <code>--name</code>: from the Wise Man’s keystore 



 <code>--alias</code>: using the Ramiel AID  



 <code>--schema</code>: using the schema SAID of the TreasureHuntingJourney schema. 



 <code>--recipient</code>: The recipient is Richard 



 <code>--data</code>: and the data sent in is specific to the credential issued to Richard. 
 



<p>The only arguments we haven’t used yet for this command are as follows:</p>



 
 <code>--edges</code>: This is for adding the edge links to other credentials, the “chain” part of authentic chained data containers. We will see this in use for the next credential we issue, the JourneyMarkRequest. 



 <code>--rules</code>: This is where the Ricardian Contracts come in to ACDCs. The TreasureHuntingJourney credential did not use the <code>--rules</code> option since the rules were baked in to the schema definition. However, the JourneyMarkRequest schema is different and uses rules passed in. 
 



 Richard’s TreasureHuntingJourneyCredential Data 



 <code>{
  "destination": "Osireion",
  "treasureSplit": "50/50",
  "partyThreshold": 2,
  "journeyEndorser": "Ramiel"
}</code> 



<p>This is the data located in the <code><a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/athena/credential_data/osireion-treasure-hunting-journey.json">abydos-tutorial/athena/credential_data/osireion-treasure-hunting-journey.json</a></code> file. It is used for both Richard’s and Elayne’s credential.</p>



<p>Listing the credentials  while polling (causes messages to be delivered)</p>



<p>Once the credential is issued using <code>kli vc issue</code> it can take a few moments to arrive so the <code>kli vc list ... --poll</code> command is useful to wait for the credential to arrive.</p>



 <code>kli vc list --name ${EXPLORER_KEYSTORE} --alias ${EXPLORER_ALIAS} --poll</code> 



<p>The output of this command looks as follows:</p>



 <code>Checking mailboxes for any received credentials......
Current received credentials for richard (EJS0-vv_OPAQCdJLmkd5dT0EW-mOfhn_Cje4yzRjTv8q):
Credential #1: EE0MvGRafksqpzyCYXm6tfaiKYR9LpUsV8YGD8KSMRIS
    Type: Treasure Hunting Journey
    Status: Issued ✔
    Issued by EIaJ5gpHSL9nl1XIWDkfMth1uxbD-AfLkqdiZL6S7HkZ
    Issued on 2023-03-27T20:23:48.536543+00:00</code> 



<p>As long as you see the <code>Status: Issued ✔</code> then you can know you have issued the credential correctly.</p>



 Issue TreasureHuntingJourney Credential – Agent (Mark I – deprecated) 



<p>Issuing credentials with the Agent is very similar to the command line except all of the data arguments are added as JSON body attributes as shown below.</p>



 <code>JOURNEY_DATA=$(cat "${ATHENA_DIR}"/credential_data/osireion-treasure-hunting-journey.json)
curl -s -X POST "${WISEMAN_AGENT_URL}/credentials/${WISEMAN_ALIAS}" \
  -H "accept: application/json" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"credentialData\":${JOURNEY_DATA},
       \"recipient\":\"${RICHARD_PREFIX}\",
       \"registry\":\"${WISEMAN_REGISTRY}\",
       \"schema\":\"${TREASURE_HUNTING_JOURNEY_SCHEMA_SAID}\"}" \
  | jq '.["d"]' | tr -d '"'</code> 



<p>Once again I pipe the response to jq and tr to select the SAID of the credential which returns in the “d” field. This is useful to store the SAID in a BASH variable for use later in the <code>workflow.sh</code> script.</p>



 Get SAID of TreasureHuntingJourney credential issued 



<p>Another way to get the SAID of the TreasureHuntingJourney credential is by using a GET request to the <code>/credentials/</code>${ALIAS} endpoint.</p>



 <code>EXPLORER_JOURNEY_CRED_SAID=$(curl -s \
  -X GET "${EXPLORER_AGENT_URL}/credentials/${EXPLORER_ALIAS}?type=received&amp;schema=${TREASURE_HUNTING_JOURNEY_SCHEMA_SAID}" \
  | jq '.[0] | .sad.d' | tr -d '"')</code> 



<p>Use this GET request if you need to read in the SAID of a particular AID. The pipe combination to selects the “d” attribute from the first credential in the list (“.[0]”) returned.</p>



 Advanced Credential Issuance – with Edges and Rules 



 ACDCs with Edges 



<p>The preceding credential issuance of TreasureHuntingJourney credentials was interesting yet it did not include one of the critical features of ACDCs: edges. Since a graph of ACDCs is connected by edges then knowing how to use an edge to connect, or “chain,” credentials together enables you to represent your domain’s credential data as a graph data structure, specifically a directed acyclic graph, which is just an append-only data structure. The JourneyMarkRequest credential includes an edge that points to the TreasureHuntingJourney credential as shown in the graph below.</p>


 
 


<p>The edge from the JourneyMarkRequest is labeled as “journey”. This is represented in the schema for the JourneyMarkRequest as well as in the schema map JSON file that KASLCred reads in. Edges can be traversed to resolve, inspect, and validate the credential the edge points to.</p>



 ACDC Rules – Ricardian Contracts 



<p>We also show an alternate way to specify rules with the <code>--rules</code> option to the KLI and the “rules” property of the JSON object sent to the Agent.</p>



 Issue JourneyMarkRequest Credential – KLI 



<p>Once the JourneyMarkRequest Credentials are issued your network will be in the following state:</p>


 
 


<p>Both Richard and Elayne will have issued JourneyMarkRequest credentials to Ramiel and these credentials will have an edge pointing back to the TreasureHuntingJourney credential Ramiel issued to them. </p>



<p>A few steps are involved in issuing the JourneyMarkRequest credential due to the fact that it points to another credential, the TreasureHuntingJourney credential. These steps include:</p>



 
 Prepare the TreasureHuntingJourney edge 



 Saidify the TreasureHuntingJourney edge 



 Include the TreasureHuntingJourney edge inside the JourneyMarkRequest during issuance. 
 



 Prepare TresureHuntingJourney Edge 



<p>A few steps are required to prepare the TreasureHuntingJourney edge for inclusion in the JourneyMarkRequest credential. All of these steps are used to write a JSON file with the edge data that will be included to either the <code>--data</code> argument to <code>kli vc issue</code> with the KLI or embedded within the “source” attribute of the JSON object POSTed to <code>"/credentials/{alias}</code>” with the Agent.</p>



 JQ filters 



<p>JQ filters are useful to write values to a JQ object which eventually will become JSON. See the “Object Construction” section of the “<a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/#TypesandValues">Types and Values</a>” section of the JQ documentation for a full explanation. In the below code, as well as in the <code><a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/workflow.sh#L697">issue_treasurehuntingjourney_credentials_agent</a></code> function in <code>workflow.sh</code> the following JQ object is used to construct an edge:</p>



 <code>{  
  d: \"\", 
  journey: {
    n: ., 
    s: \"${TREASURE_HUNTING_JOURNEY_SCHEMA_SAID}\"
  }
}</code> 



<p>The BASH variable “TREASURE_HUNTING_JOURNEY_SCHEMA_SAID” is added in before the <code>echo</code> statement writes that JQ object to the file “JOURNEY_EDGE_FILTER”. This SAID is what it seems, the SAID of the TreasureHuntingJourney ACDC Schema. This is written into the JQ filter object.</p>



<p>JQ is then used to add the “EXPLORER_JOURNEY_SAID” into the “n” field of the JQ filter using the period “.” expression with the input piped into <code>jq</code> to output the resulting edge JSON.</p>



 <code>JOURNEY_EDGE_FILTER=${ATHENA_DIR}/credential_edges/richard-journey-edge-filter.jq
RICHARD_JOURNEY_EDGE=${ATHENA_DIR}/credential_edges/richard-journey-edge.json
echo "{d: \"\", journey: {n: ., s: \"${TREASURE_HUNTING_JOURNEY_SCHEMA_SAID}\"}}" &gt;"${JOURNEY_EDGE_FILTER}"
EXPLORER_JOURNEY_SAID=$(kli vc list --name ${EXPLORER_KEYSTORE} \
  --alias ${EXPLORER_ALIAS} \
  --said \
  --schema "${TREASURE_HUNTING_JOURNEY_SCHEMA_SAID}")
echo \""${EXPLORER_JOURNEY_SAID}"\" \
  | jq -f "${JOURNEY_EDGE_FILTER}" &gt;"${RICHARD_JOURNEY_EDGE}"
kli saidify --file "${RICHARD_JOURNEY_EDGE}"
# Add SAID to the JourneyMarkRequest rules
kli saidify --file "${ATHENA_DIR}"/credential_rules/journey-mark-request-rules.json</code> 



 SAIDify TreasureHuntingJourneyEdge 



<p>Finally after writing the edge JSON the file is SAIDified with <code>kli saidify</code>. This populates the “d” attribute of the JSON with a self addressing identifier, or SAID. A self addressing identifier, according to the <a href="https://weboftrust.github.io/ietf-said/draft-ssmith-said.html#section-1-2">spec</a>, is:</p>



<blockquote><p>is a special class of content-addressable identifier that is also self-referential […] this approach of deriving self-referential identifiers from the contents they identify, is called&nbsp;<code>self-addressing</code>. It allows any validator to verify or re-derive the&nbsp;<code>self-referential, self-addressing identifier</code>&nbsp;given the contents it identifies.</p>Self-Addressing Identifier (SAID) IETF Draft Specification – Dr. Samuel M. Smith</blockquote>



<p>This essentially means the value of the “d” field is computed from the value of everything else in the JSON object and as such is a value derived from everything else in the JSON object, thus self-addressing. Read the spec to learn about the specialized derivation function required to verify a SAID.</p>



<p>The following is an example of a complete TreasureHuntingJourney edge:</p>



 <code>{
  "d": "EGRPqBFL0xM0CPeTyc487pfO-MtR5UlYub0S-Rpyx6nm",
  "journey": {
    "n": "EE0MvGRafksqpzyCYXm6tfaiKYR9LpUsV8YGD8KSMRIS",
    "s": "EIxAox3KEhiQ_yCwXWeriQ3ruPWbgK94NDDkHAZCuP9l"
  }
}</code> 



<p>Once the SAIDified file is created then the “journey” edge is ready to be incorporated into the issuance of the JourneyMarkRequest credential.</p>



 Issue JourneyMarkRequest credential with edge 



<p>By now many of the options used below for <code>kli vc issue</code> will be familiar to you. Using the at symbol “<code>@</code>” in the arguments instructs the command to retrieve the contents of the file indicated by the file path. The command options in addition to <code>--name</code> and <code>--alias</code> describe above include:</p>



 
 <code>--registry-name</code> as the registry from which to issue the credential. 



 <code>--schema</code> indicating which ACDC schema to use. Value is the SAID from the “$id” field of the schema you are using to issue the credential with. 



 <code>--recipient</code> indicates who is receiving the issued ACDC. The value is the AID prefix for the recipient of the ACDC. An OOBI must resolved for the recipient’s prefix so that the issuer controller knows where to send the ACDC. 



 <code>--data</code> is the credential-specific data that is described by the “attributes” section of schema referenced by the <code>--schema</code> argument. 



 <code>--edges</code> is the JSON object that contains the edge definitions to link the credentials together. 



 <code>--rules</code> is the JSON object containing the Ricardian Contract definitions for this particular ACDC. 
 



 Data 



<p>An example of the data for this credential is as follows:</p>



 <code>{
  "requester": {
    "firstName": "Richard",
    "lastName": "Ayris",
    "nickname": "Dunkie"
  },
  "desiredPartySize": 2,
  "desiredSplit": 50.00
}</code> 



 Command 



 <code> kli vc issue --name ${EXPLORER_KEYSTORE} \
  --alias ${EXPLORER_ALIAS} \
  --registry-name ${EXPLORER_REGISTRY} \
  --schema "${JOURNEY_MARK_REQUEST_SCHEMA_SAID}" \
  --recipient "${WISEMAN_PREFIX}" \
  --data @"${ATHENA_DIR}"/credential_data/journey-mark-request-data-richard.json \
  --edges @"${RICHARD_JOURNEY_EDGE}" \
  --rules @"${ATHENA_DIR}"/credential_rules/journey-mark-request-rules.json</code> 



 List Credentials to see newly issued Request 



<p>Once again we wait for the credential to be issued with <code>kli vc list ... --poll</code> using the <code>--schema</code> SAID of the JourneyMarkRequest schema. This polls for all credentials the wise man has received under this schema. </p>



 <code>kli vc list --name ${WISEMAN_KEYSTORE} \
  --alias ${WISEMAN_ALIAS} \
  --schema "${JOURNEY_MARK_REQUEST_SCHEMA_SAID}" \
  --poll</code> 



<p>This will provide output similar to the following:</p>



 <code>Checking mailboxes for any received credentials......
Current received credentials for ramiel (EIaJ5gpHSL9nl1XIWDkfMth1uxbD-AfLkqdiZL6S7HkZ):

    Issued on 2023-03-28T22:20:03.452772+00:00</code> 



 Issue JourneyMarkRequest Credential – Agent (Mark I – deprecated) 



<p>Performing the issuance of the JourneyMarkRequest with the Mark I Agent is very similar to using. the KLI. The primary difference is that the JSON files passed in to <code>--data</code>, <code>--edges</code>, and <code>--rules</code> are placed inside the JSON body of the HTTP POST request to the <code>/credentials/{alias}/</code> route.</p>



 Prepare TreasureHuntingJourney Edge 



<p>The preparation steps here are pretty much identical to preparing the TreasureHuntingJourney edge for the KLI version of this section.</p>



 <code># Add SAID to JourneyMarkRequest rules
kli saidify --file "${ATHENA_DIR}"/credential_rules/journey-mark-request-rules.json
RICHARD_JOURNEY_EDGE_FILTER=${ATHENA_DIR}/credential_edges/richard-journey-edge-filter.jq
RICHARD_JOURNEY_EDGE=${ATHENA_DIR}/credential_edges/richard-journey-edge.json
echo "{d: \"\", journey: {n: ., s: \"${TREASURE_HUNTING_JOURNEY_SCHEMA_SAID}\"}}" &gt;"${RICHARD_JOURNEY_EDGE_FILTER}"
EXPLORER_JOURNEY_SAID=$(curl -s -X GET "${EXPLORER_AGENT_URL}/credentials/${EXPLORER_ALIAS}?type=received&amp;schema=${TREASURE_HUNTING_JOURNEY_SCHEMA_SAID}" | jq '.[0] | .sad.d' | tr -d '"')
echo \""${EXPLORER_JOURNEY_SAID}"\" | jq -f "${RICHARD_JOURNEY_EDGE_FILTER}" &gt;"${RICHARD_JOURNEY_EDGE}"
kli saidify --file "${RICHARD_JOURNEY_EDGE}"
</code> 



<p>Once you have the SAIDified edge file ready then you use it to issue the JourneyMarkRequest credential.</p>



 Issue JourneyMarkRequest Credential 



<p>To simplify issuing this credential from the <code>workflow.sh</code> script the contents of the JSON files for the data, rules, and edges are stored in BASH variables using the <code>VARNAME=$(cat FILENAME)</code> pattern. This makes it easy to include the contents in the <code>curl</code> command below.</p>



 <code>REQUEST_RULES=$(cat "${ATHENA_DIR}"/credential_rules/journey-mark-request-rules.json)
RICHARD_MARK_DATA=$(cat "${ATHENA_DIR}"/credential_data/journey-mark-request-data-richard.json)
RICHARD_EDGE_DATA=$(cat "${RICHARD_JOURNEY_EDGE}")
curl -s -X POST "${EXPLORER_AGENT_URL}/credentials/${EXPLORER_ALIAS}" \
  -H "accept: application/json" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"credentialData\":${RICHARD_MARK_DATA},
       \"recipient\":\"${WISEMAN_PREFIX}\",
       \"registry\":\"${EXPLORER_REGISTRY}\",
       \"schema\":\"${JOURNEY_MARK_REQUEST_SCHEMA_SAID}\",
       \"source\":${RICHARD_EDGE_DATA},
       \"rules\":${REQUEST_RULES}}" \
  | jq '.d' | tr -d '"'
# since there is no polling then sleep to wait for credential delivery
sleep 5</code> 



<p>There doesn’t exist an equivalent to <code>kli vc list ... --poll</code> in the KERIpy Mark I agent so you can perform a <code>sleep 5</code> or something similar for an equivalent wait to ensure that a request to <code>/credentials/{alias}/type=issued&amp;schema={schema_said}</code> will return the issued credential. You could also manually poll this endpoint, process the JSON array of credentials returned, and then continue to poll if the return body doesn’t contain the expected credential.</p>



<p>Next we move on to reviewing the listed credentials with a GET request.</p>



 List Credentials to see newly issued request 



<p>Make a GET request to the <code>/credentials/{alias}/type=issued&amp;schema={schema_said}</code> endpoint on a Mark I agent to get all credentials issued by that agent’s controller of the specified schema type. Below. I use <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Command-Substitution.html">command substitution</a> to encapsulate this sort of request as well as a pipe to jq and tr in order to retrieve the credential SAID for later use in the <code>workflow.sh</code> script.</p>



 <code>EXPLORER_REQUEST_CRED_SAID=$(curl -s -X GET "${EXPLORER_AGENT_URL}/credentials/${EXPLORER_ALIAS}?type=issued&amp;schema=${JOURNEY_MARK_REQUEST_SCHEMA_SAID}" | jq '.[0] | .sad.d' | tr -d '"')</code> 



<p>Executing the GET request to a controller, in this case the Wise Man, without the command substitution returns a response that looks similar to the following, with some attributes minimized:</p>


 
 


<p>There will be more than one credential returned if you issue this GET request after running the <code>workflow.sh</code> script.</p>



 Issuance Wrap Up 



 Issuing the JourneyMark Credential 



<p>Issuing the JourneyMark credential is essentially the same process as the JourneyMarkRequest issuance only with different data, edges, and rules. As a challenge for you try to issue this credential without reading the code in the <code><a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/workflow.sh#L834">issue_journeymark_credentials</a></code> and <code><a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/workflow.sh#L883">issue_journeymark_credentials_agent</a></code> functions in <code>workflow.sh</code>.</p>



<p>Once the JourneyMark credentials have been issued your issuance state will look like the following:</p>


 
 


<p>As you can see the JourneyMark credentials have been issued from Ramiel to both Richard and Elayne.</p>



 Issuing the JourneyCharter Credential 



<p>The presence of two edges in the edge file is the only substantive difference in issuing this credential as compared to the issuance of both the JourneyMarkRequest and the JourneyMark credential issuance processes. The finished edge file looks like this:</p>



 <code>{
  "d": "",
  "mark": {
    "n": "EI4Z_hKC7hzWfslkhGD8tGv0eMQCBpmVXx-sJ3Xugz8_",
    "s": "EBEefH4LNQswHSrXanb-3GbjCZK7I_UCL6BdD-zwJ4my"
  },

<p>As an added challenge to top it all off for this section take your knowledge of schema writing, schema linking, edge creation, and credential issuance and make your best attempt at assembling your own JourneyCharter edges file for use in issuing the JourneyCharter credential. If you get stuck you can look at the code in the <code><a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/workflow.sh#LL937C10-L937C42">issue_journeycharter_credentials</a></code> and <code><a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/workflow.sh#L998">issue_journeycharter_credentials_agent</a></code> functions from the <code>workflow.sh</code> script.</p>



 Final Credential Issuance State 



<p>Once all of the credentials have been issued you will have the state of your credential issuance as shown in the below picture.</p>


 
 


<p>This shows that Ramiel has issued the JourneyCharter to both Richard and Elayne.</p>



<p>With all of the credentials issued we can finally move on to one of the most exciting parts, Credential Presentation.</p>



 Credential Presentation 



<p>In order for a decentralized identity credentialing system to have any value it must be able to plug into a business process somewhere. Credential presentation is the beginning of plugging in a credentialing system to your custom business process logic. Your primary option here is to write a custom controller. The “<a href="https://github.com/GLEIF-IT/sally">Sally</a>” project is one such custom controller. It treats KERIpy as a library on top of which to layer in your custom business logic. I did precisely this in <a href="https://github.com/kentbull/sally">my fork</a> of Sally (a.k.a. Abydos Gatekeeper), which I explain below.</p>



<p>Custom business logic must plug directly in to the credential processing workflow within a controller and respond to credential validation actions that occur when a credential is presented based on whether the credential is issued or revoked. The point at which the custom business logic comes into contact with the decentralized identity system are in custom handler functions written in your custom controller.</p>



<p>A webhook is called from the custom handler functions to illustrate how you would signal controller events to an app, possibly a wallet app, waiting to be notified of event completions from the KERI Agent.</p>



 Presentation Handling Setup 



<p>In order to respond to the credential presentation we must do the following setup steps:</p>



 
 Ensure version 0.6.0 of the <a href="https://github.com/kentbull/sally">kentbull/sally</a> fork (a.k.a. Abydos Gatekeeper) is installed with <code>python -m pip install -e ./</code> from the fork repo root. 



 Write a credential type mapping file similar to the <code><a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/athena/schemas/schema-mappings.json">schema-mappings.json</a></code> file that pairs the ACDC schema SAIDs you wrote with credential type names that will be keyed off of in the custom controller. This is important so that the schema SAIDs you generated in your schema linking step match up with the ones the Abydos Gatekeeper (sally) expects. 



 Start the Abydos Gatekeeper (sally) with the appropriate command line arguments including the mapping file you wrote (or copied from the tutorial repo). 



 Start the webhook on the same port you specified when you started the Abydos Gatekeeper 



 Present the credential. 



 Await the webhook’s response to the credential. 
 



 Examples in workflow.sh script 



<p>All of these steps, except dependency installation, are written into the <code>workflow.sh</code> script.</p>



 
 The schema mappings file writing occurs on <a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/workflow.sh#L199">line 199 inside read_schema_saids</a>. Once again jq is used, this time with the <code>--null-input</code> argument, to write a JSON file based on a jq filter file, the <code><a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/athena/schemas/schema-mappings-filter.jq">schema-mappings-filter.jq</a></code> file. 



 The gatekeeper is started up in the <code><a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/workflow.sh#L512">start_gatekeeper</a></code> function. <br>You will see this includes the <code>--schema-mappings</code> argument that expects the schema mappings file you wrote earlier.<br>This also includes the <code>--web-hook</code> argument. Set this to be the web hook you started earlier. This will be <code>http://127.0.0.1:9923</code>.<br>Finally, the <code>--auth</code> argument must be set to the AID prefix of the Wise Man Ramiel so that the schema validation functions can allow Richard’s and Elayne’s JourneyCharter credentials to pass validation. 
 



<p>Next we walk through the code customizations made to the Sally server that enable responding to ATHENA-specific ACDC schema types.</p>



 Abydos Gatekeeper : Custom Controller Code for credential handlers 



<p>This is the most complicated, least explained portion of this tutorial. If you want to stay out of the inner details of the custom controller and out of KERIpy then just follow the commands listed in the <code>workflow.sh</code> script. On the other hand, if you are willing to venture into this depth I will assume you have some familiarity with Python as well as the bravery to confront the innards of the flow-based programming, hierarchical structured concurrency asynchronous runtime library Dr. Smith wrote, <code><a href="https://github.com/ioflo/hio">ioflo/hio</a></code>, that is at the core of both KERIpy and the Sally custom controller. </p>



<p>After reading through the controller code, or KERIpy code, you may find yourself wanting to write a custom controller either with a different async framework or another language, which are reasonable desires. I encourage you to dig a little deeper into the HIO code and the KERIpy code before rewriting it. I expect to have a future blog post on the HIO library as well as its usage in KERIpy, though do what. you think is most reasonable. I offer this suggestion just to encourage you to become familiar with the core KERI internals mostly so we can increase the core contributor count to KERIpy. Many hands make light work.</p>



 Communicator class 



<p>The <code><a href="https://github.com/kentbull/sally/blob/dev/src/sally/core/handling.py#L113">Communicator</a></code> class in <code>sally/src/sally/core/handling.py</code> is our main focus. The primary difference between the GLEIF-IT upstream repository and my fork of Sally is that I made a dict of schema handlers keyed by the names of credentials so it would be easy to swap in new schema SAIDs to be recognized as I wrote the schema files during initial development of the schemas. I also thought it readable and human-friendly to use schema type names like “TreasureHuntingJourney” as dict keys rather than schema prefixes like “EIxAox3KEhiQ_yCwXWeriQ3ruPWbgK94NDDkHAZCuP9l”.</p>



 <code># line 107-110 in handling.py
JOURNEY_TYPE = 'TreasureHuntingJourney'
REQUEST_TYPE = 'JourneyMarkRequest'
MARK_TYPE = 'JourneyMark'
CHARTER_TYPE = 'JourneyCharter'</code> 



<p>Technically you could hardcode the schema prefixes into your code since once you standardize on a specific set of ACDC schemas and they are in production then you won’t be changing them especially since you must support backwards compatibility likely indefinitely for whatever schemas you release to production. Yet, even with this technical possibility, I prefer to use schema type names so I wrote a a resolver function to resolve a schema.</p>



 Communicator init function 



<p>You can see in the init function I made a dict for schema handlers and another dict for payload handlers that maps the type names above to specific functions.</p>


 
 


<p>I then use two resolver functions, type to SAID and SAID to type, to pair up schema SAIDs from incoming presentations to the configured SAIDs from the schema SAID mapping file we wrote earlier:</p>



 <code>def resolve_said_to_type(self, schema_said):
    for mapping in self.mappings:
        if mapping.said == schema_said:
            return mapping.credential_type
    raise kering.ValidationError(f"no mapping found for schema {schema_said}")
def resolve_type_to_said(self, credential_type):
    for mapping in self.mappings:
        if mapping.credential_type == credential_type:
            return mapping.said
    raise kering.ValidationError(f"no mapping found for schema {credential_type}")</code> 



<p>If no mapping is found for a given type then a ValidationError is raised.</p>



 Schema Validator Function Selection and Invocation 



<p>After resolving the schema type for an incoming credential then a handler is selected from the configured SAID mapping file as shown <a href="https://github.com/kentbull/sally/blob/dev/src/sally/core/handling.py#L185">on line 185</a> in order to select and then invoke a credential validator:</p>


 
 


 Payload Handler Function Selection and Invocation 



<p>After selecting the validator, and assuming the credential passes validation, a response payload handler is selected <a href="https://github.com/kentbull/sally/blob/dev/src/sally/core/handling.py#L246">on line 246</a> and then invoked.</p>


 
 


<p>Again, if no schema validator or handler is found an exception is raised. Otherwise the correct handler is selected to validate the schema and then the correct payload handler prepares the response to the presentation event.</p>



<p>Both of the following functions are the most complicated versions of their functions in Abydos Gatekeeper. You can read through the other similar functions if you want more illustrations.</p>



 JourneyCharter schema validator 



<p>As you can see in the <code><a href="https://github.com/kentbull/sally/blob/dev/src/sally/core/handling.py#LL414C12-L414C12">validateJourneyCharter</a></code> function first the ACDC schema SAID is validated, the credential issuer is verified, and then the credential is handed to other validation functions to validate the full credential chain. Refer to the code for a complete understanding of what it means to validate the full credential chain.</p>


 
 


 JourneyCharter payload handler 



<p>In response to a credential presentation the custom controller can return a customized object which. in this case is the data dict beginning at line 511. What makes this payload function more interesting is the use of the registry (reger) object to retrieve data from each of the credentials chained to the JourneyCharter credential.</p>


 
 


<p>With all of this setup complete we are ready to set up the webhook.</p>



 Webhook Setup 



<p>The webhook only starts up a HTTP server on the default port of 9923. You start it up with the following:</p>



 <code>$ sally hook demo
# Should provide output like the following:
launching on port 9923
Sally Web Hook Sample listening on 9923</code> 



<p>Once the webhook is listening then you are ready to make a presentation and receive a response from the controller.</p>



 Present JourneyCharter Credential – KLI 



<p>Making a presentation request requires knowing the SAID of the credential you want to present as well as the alias of the recipient you want to send the presentation to. This alias must match up the OOBI alias name you used earlier when resolving an OOBI to connect the presenting controller to the target controller the presentation is being sent to.</p>



 <code># First we get the SAID of the JourneyCharter credential for Richard
RICHARD_CRED_SAID=$(kli vc list --name ${EXPLORER_KEYSTORE} \
  --alias ${EXPLORER_ALIAS} \
  --said \
  --schema ${JOURNEY_CHARTER_SCHEMA_SAID})
# Then we present the credential to the Gatekeeper
kli vc present --name ${EXPLORER_KEYSTORE} \
  --alias ${EXPLORER_ALIAS} \
  --said "${RICHARD_CRED_SAID}" \
  --recipient ${GATEKEEPER_ALIAS} \
  --include</code> 



<p>The <code>--include</code> option instructs the KLI to send all of the ACDC data in the presentation and is critical in order for the request to work.</p>



<p>Once the presentation is sent you will need to wait a few moments for the target controller to receive the credential, validate it, and then send the response payload to the webhook.</p>



 Webhook Response 



<p>All the webhook does is return a dump of the HTTP headers and the HTTP request body. For example, the Gatekeeper’s response to Richard’s presentation of the JourneyCharter credential looks like the following, and Elayne’s is very similar:</p>



 <code>Gatekeeper | received request

 Present JourneyCharter Credential – Agent (Mark I – deprecated) 



<p>Presenting with the agent is very similar to with the KLI. You must know the recipient alias, corresponding to the “oobialias” property used to register an OOBI earlier, you must know the ACDC schema SAID, as well as the SAID of the credential you want to present.</p>



 <code>EXPLORER_CHARTER_CRED_SAID=$(curl -s \
  -X GET "${EXPLORER_AGENT_URL}/credentials/${EXPLORER_ALIAS}?type=received&amp;schema=${JOURNEY_CHARTER_SCHEMA_SAID}" \
  | jq '.[0] | .sad.d' | tr -d '"')
curl -s \
  -X POST "${EXPLORER_AGENT_URL}/credentials/${EXPLORER_ALIAS}/presentations" \
  -H 'accept: */*' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{
        \"recipient\": \"${GATEKEEPER_ALIAS}\",
        \"said\": \"${EXPLORER_CHARTER_CRED_SAID}\",
        \"schema\": \"${JOURNEY_CHARTER_SCHEMA_SAID}\",
        \"include\": true
      }"</code> 



<p>Once again the <code>"include": true</code> property is essential to instruct the agent to send all of the ACDC data for the JourneyMark credential and all linked credentials to the recipient controller, the Abydos Gatekeeper.</p>



 Credential Revocation 



<p>Revocation is an essential part of the lifecycle of an ACDC-style credential. A credential may be revoked at any time. This is represented as a “rev” action in the TEL for that ACDC and can be included in either an “ixn” (Interaction) or “rot” (Rotation) event in the controller’s KEL.</p>



 Revoke JourneyCharter Credential – KLI 



<p>Revoking a credential is very simple. Starting with the SAID of the credential to be revoked the below example stores it in the BASH variable <code>RICHARD_JOURNEY_CHARTER_CRED_SAID</code> which Iis then fed into the <code>kli vc revoke</code> command. </p>



 <code>RICHARD_JOURNEY_CHARTER_CRED_SAID=$(kli vc list \
  --name ${EXPLORER_KEYSTORE} \
  --alias ${EXPLORER_ALIAS} \
  --said \
  --schema ${JOURNEY_CHARTER_SCHEMA_SAID})
kli vc revoke --name ${WISEMAN_KEYSTORE} \
  --alias ${WISEMAN_ALIAS} \
  --registry-name ${WISEMAN_REGISTRY} \
  --said "${RICHARD_JOURNEY_CHARTER_CRED_SAID}" \
  --send ${GATEKEEPER_ALIAS}</code> 



<p>Then when this credential is presented again later the Gatekeeper will see that the credential has been revoked. </p>



<p>The <code>--send</code> argument is essential to instruct the issuing controller to send the revocation notice to the target controller, in this case the Gatekeeper. </p>



 Webhook revocation notification 



<p>With the revocation information the Gatekeeper adjusts its internal state for that credential and then triggers the webhook with a revocation payload. The output from the webhook looks like the following:</p>



 <code>Gatekeeper | received request
Gatekeeper | Invalid credential. Revoked on: 2023-03-29T15:17:19.394845+00:00

  }
}

 Presenting a Revoked Credential 



<p>When you try to present the credential again to the Gatekeeper the revocation status is detected.</p>



 <code>kli vc present --name explorer --alias richard \
  --said ${RICHARD_JOURNEY_CHARTER_CRED_SAID} \
  --recipient zaqiel \
  --include</code> 



<p>Yet the Gatekeeper detects the revoked status:</p>



 <code>revoked credential EIdNBtudTLx3g-WWIYmuvzkUmVnXgT3EdaUC-3JbeAv1 being presented
# ...continues on to send revoked credential to the webhook</code> 



<p>The one thing missing from the Abydos Gatekeeper for this revocation flow is to send a different payload to the webhook when a revoked credential is presented. This topic will be explored in a future blog post.</p>



<p>With that complete we move on to the bonus section on revocation with the Mark I agent.</p>



 Bonus – Revoke JourneyCharter Credential – Agent (Mark I – deprecated) 



<p>A simple revocation is possible with the Mark I Agent yet it is missing functionality similar to the <code>--send</code> argument to <code>kli vc revoke</code> and thus should not be used. It is included here as an illustration of how revocation with an agent may work.</p>



 <code>curl -s \
  -X DELETE "${WISEMAN_AGENT}/credentials/${WISEMAN_ALIAS}?registry=${WISEMAN_REGISTRY}&amp;said=${EXPLORER_JOURNEY_CHARTER_CRED_SAID}" \
  --header 'accept: */*' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json'</code> 



<p>The response is an HTTP 202 Accepted and a blank response body.</p>



 Congratulate yourself! 



<p>Your little network is now readys to send our dear treasure hunters on their journey to the Osireion at Abydos! They, and ATHENA, will be very pleased with you and your work. Maybe you will even get a cut of the treasure.</p>

Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.</p>       <p>To explore access management patterns, let's classify applications requiring fine-grained access management into one of two types:</p>  <p>Structured—these applications can use the structure of the attribute information to simplify access management. For example, an HR application might express a policy as “all L9 managers with more than 10 reports can access compensation management functionality for their reports”. The structure allows attributes like <code>level</code> and <code>number_of_reports</code> to be used to manage access to the compensation tool with a single policy. A smalls set of policies can control access to the compensation tool. These applications are the sweet spot for ABAC.</p>  <p>Ad hoc—these applications allow users to manage access to resources they control based on identifiers for both principals and resources without any underlying structure. For example, Alice shares her vacation photo album with Betty and Charlie. The photo album, Betty, and Charlie have no attributes in common that can be used to write a single attribute-based policy defining access. These applications have a harder time making effective use of ABAC.</p>  <p>Ad hoc access management is more difficult than structured because of the combinatorial explosion of possible access relationships. When any principal can share any resource they control with any other principal and with any subset of possible actions, the number of combinations quickly becomes very large.</p><p>There are several approaches we can take to ad hoc access management:</p>  <p>Policy-based—In this approach the application writes a new policy for every access case. In the example given above, when Alice shares her vacation photo album with Betty and Charlie, the application would create a policy that explicitly permits Betty and Charlie to access Alice’s vacation photo album. Every change in access would result in a new policy or the modification of an existing one. This is essentially using policies as ACLs.</p>  <p>Group-based—In a group-based approach, we create a group for people who can access the vacation photo album and a policy that allows access to the vacation photo album if the user has a group attribute of <code>canAccessVacationPhotos</code>. The group name has to be unique to Alice's vacation photo album and includes the allowed action. When Alice shares the album with Betty and Charlie, we add them both to the <code>canAccessVacationPhotos</code> group by putting it in the <code>groups</code>attribute in their profile. Group-based policies look like "principal <code>P</code> can access <code>vacationPhotosAlbum</code> if <code>P.groups contains canAccessVacationPhotos</code>." This is essentually RBAC.</p>  <p>Resource-based—In this approach, we add a <code>sharedWith</code> or <code>canEdit</code> attribute to Alice’s vacation photos album that records the principals who can access the resource. Now our policy uses the resource attribute to allow access to anyone in that list. Resource-based policies look like "principal <code>P</code> can edit resource <code>R</code> if <code>P </code>is in <code>R.canEdit</code>". Every resource of the same type has the same attributes. This approach is close to ABAC because it makes use of attributes on the resources to manage access, reducing the combinatorial explosion.</p>  <p>Hybrid—We can combine group and resource-based access management by creating groups of users and storing group names in resource attribute instead of principals. For example, if Alice adds Betty and Charlie to her group <code>friends</code>, then she could add <code>friends</code> to the <code>sharedWith</code> attribute on her album. The advantage of the hybrid approach is we reduce the length of the attribute lists.</p>  <p>The advantage of the policy-based approach is that it’s the <a href="http://c2.com/xp/DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">simplest thing that could possibly work</a>. Given a policy store with sufficient management features (i.e., finding, filtering, creating, modifying, and deleting policies) this is straight-forward. The chief downside is the explosion in the number of policies and the scaling that it requires of the policy store. Also since the user’s permissions are scattered among many different policies, knowing who can do what is difficult and relies on the policy store's filtering capabilities.</p><p>The group-based approach results in a large number of groups for very specific purposes. This is a common problem with RBAC systems. But given an attribute store (like an IdM profile) that scales well, it splits the work between the attribute and policy stores by reducing the number of policies to one per share type (or combination). That is, we need a policy for each resource that allows viewing, one to allow editing, and so on. </p><p>The resource-base approach reduces the explosion of groups by attaching attributes to the resource, imposing structure. In the photo album sharing example, each album (and photo) would need an attribute for each sharing type (view, modify, delete). If Alice says Betty can view and modify an album, Betty’s identifier would be added to the view and modify attributes for that album. We need a policy for each unique resource type and action.</p><p>The downside of the resource-based approach is that the access management system has to be able to use resource attributes in the authorization context. Integrating the access management system with an IdP provides attributes about principals so that we can automatically make those attributes available in the authorization context. You could integrate using the attributes in an <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OIDC</a> token or by syncing the authorization service with the IdP using <a href="https://www.okta.com/blog/2017/01/what-is-scim/">SCIM</a>.</p><p>But the ways that attributes can be attached to a resource are varied. For example, they might be stored in the application's database. They might be part of an inventory control system. And so on. So the access management system must allow developers to inject those attributes into the authorization context when the policy enforcement point is queried or have a sufficiently flexible policy information point to easily integrate it with different databases and APIs. Commercial ABAC systems will have solved this problem because it is core to how they function.</p><p>Every application, of course, will make architectural decisions about access management based its specific needs. But if you understand the patterns that are available to you, then you can think through the ramifications of your design ahead of time. Sometimes this is lost in the myth that policy-based access management (PBAC) is all the same. All of the approaches I list above are PBAC, but they're not all ABAC.</p>    Notes   <p>The material that follows is not in the book. But it should be. An errata, perhaps.</p>     <p>Thanks for reading Phil Windley's Technometria! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.</p>

  <p>The challenge, to come up with language that describes the value that is enabled through the technical standards that comprise what is known as IDTech (also known as Self-Sovereign Identity or the Decentralized Identity stack).&nbsp; This is independent of the different variations within the technology stack, and more importantly is meant for the vast majority of the business? population that have never heard of different standards bodies, protocols or tech stacks, and who quite frankly don’t care and will never exert the effort to learn about them.&nbsp; In many cases these are the exact people who make the final investment go/no-go decision.</p><p>After hundreds of conversations and countless hours of research and reading over the past five years, four ‘qualities of value’ have emerged.&nbsp; These are provenance, persistence, composability, and portability.&nbsp;&nbsp; If these values are important in your business or operations, then this technology sector will be important for you.</p><p>Provenance, the ability to trace where something, whether data or physical object, has come from, and to have confidence the data has not been tampered with.&nbsp;&nbsp; More than just that, it is being able to trace back to the source with the highest level of confidence.&nbsp; This means to be able to automatically (no human intervention) determine what entity issued or attested to the data or physical object and to validate that this party is authorized to make these claims.&nbsp; </p><p>Persistence, the ability to act on data and information whether the original source of the data continues to exist or not.&nbsp; A reality of life is constant change.&nbsp; For anyone interacting with technology, the rate of change seems only to go up.&nbsp; With change, older systems become unavailable, but information links may need to persist far beyond the life of the source system.&nbsp; Having a mechanism that provides high levels of assurance on the information integrity under the control of the interested entity define / rephrase? can mean a decoupling of systems, reducing complexity and increasing resilience.</p><p>Composability, the ability to use the data about an object in ways that extend beyond the original intended use of the data.&nbsp; The most common example of a document that is used widely outside its intended use is the driver’s license, which is also used as a piece of identity documentation for purchasing age restricted products, writing a check (in the US), checking into a hotel and many other uses that have nothing to do with driving a vehicle.&nbsp; This is a broad but simplistic use case. When an individual or organization has the ability to select data from various parties and combine these into a single new claim, presenting this composite claim to any entity while retaining the highest levels of provenance outlined above, this creates new business models and revenue opportunities are found.</p><p>Portability, the ability to bring the data “with me”, and to do so in a manner that does not leave a link or connection to the issuer of the data.&nbsp; This is the ability to move this information between systems and vendors.&nbsp; As an individual or business, data portability is of value as a means to prevent capture or lock-in to a specific vendor.&nbsp; Additionally, being able to use the data in a manner that does not leave a ‘bread crumb trail’ every time it is used (or shared) is critical for personal privacy as well as business confidentiality, and has become a requirement under the law with the GDPR and CCPA regulations. </p><p>In this first post, I have intentionally kept the concepts at a high level.&nbsp; In the following posts, I will delve further into each of these Values, expanding on them and bringing in examples of where they would apply.&nbsp; I will endeavor to keep technical language and jargon out of the posts where at all possible.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;Updated July 5, 2023 - The original post had ‘Flexibility.’ as the third quality.  After further reflection this word did fit.  It did not effectively communicate the power latent in the verifiable credential.  The word Composability brings to mind the power of a Beethoven, Mozart, or Stevie Ray Vaughn who combined the unique capabilities of the set of instruments available to great powerful and great music.  </p>

  In Mapping the wider fediverse I showed how a new table added to the Mastodon plugin — mastodon_domain_block — enables queries that find which servers are moderating which other servers. For example, here are servers on nerdculture.de‘s list of offenders. select server, domain, severity from mastodon_domain_block where server = 'https://nerdculture.de' +------------------------+--------------------

I used the new query pattern to build a <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-mastodon-insights">dashboard</a> to report, for each server in the home timeline:</p>
 
 The list of blocking servers.
  The count of blocked servers for each blocking server.
  The list of blocking servers for each blocked server, and the count of those blocking servers.
  
<p>
This was a good start, but I had a hunch that <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2023/01/16/mastodon-relationship-graphs/">relationship graphs</a> would reveal non-obvious connections among these servers. And indeed they do! Here’s a view of the new graph-enriched dashboard.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/blocked-and-blocking.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>
The left pane shows the blocked servers shunned by a blocking server selected from those in the home timeline. The right pane has the inverse view: the blocking servers that shun a selected blocked server. These were the two categories I defined for the first iteration of these graphs.</p>
 category "blocking_server" {
  color = "darkgreen"
  icon = "server"
}

category "blocked_server" {
  color = "darkred"
  icon = "server"
}
 
<p>
Here’s the code for one of the graphs.</p>
 graph {
   node {
    base = node.blocking_server
  }
   node {
    base = node.blocked_server
  }
   node {
    base = node.blocked_and_blocking_server
  }
   edge {
    args = [ self.input.blocking_server.value ]
    base = edge.match_blocked_server
  }
   edge {
    args = [ self.input.blocking_server.value ]
    base = edge.match_blocking_server
  }
}
 
<p>
Here is the definition of node.blocking_server, which refers to category.blocking_server.</p>
 node "blocking_server" {
  category = category.blocking_server
  sql = &lt;&lt;EOQ
    with servers as (
      select distinct
        blocking_server,
        blocked_server
      from
        blocking_servers(${local.limit})
    )
    select
      blocking_server as id,
      blocking_server as title
    from
      servers
    order by
      blocking_server
  EOQ
}
 
<p>
The FROM clause calls blocking_servers(), a <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/08/21/postgres-functional-style/">set-returning function</a> defined like so.</p>
 create or replace function public.blocking_servers(max int) returns table (
  blocking_server text,
  blocked_server text
) as $$
with servers as (
  select distinct
    server as domain,
    'https://' || server as server_url
  from
    mastodon_toot
  where
    timeline = 'home'
  limit max
),
blocking_and_blocked as (
  select
    s.domain as blocking_domain,
    d.domain as blocked_domain
  from
    servers s
  join
    mastodon_domain_block d
  on
    s.server_url = d.server
)
select
  blocking_domain,
  blocked_domain
from
  blocking_and_blocked
order by
  blocking_domain, blocked_domain
$$ language sql
 
<p>I thought these ingredients would suffice. But when I began poking around in the graphs made with these definitions, infosec.exchange behaved strangely. Someties it would appear as a blocking server, other times as a blocked server. I was missing a category!</p>
 category "blocked_and_blocking_server" {
  color = "orange"
  icon = "server"
}
 
<p>
As you can see in the graph, infosec.exchange not only blocks 73 servers, it is also blocked by two servers: religion.masto.host and weatherishappening.net. Why?</p>
<p>
<a href="https://weatherishappening.net/about">weatherishappening.net</a> calls infosec.exchange a “HOSTING DEATH SPIRAL FASCIST ORGANIZATION” and blocks it with “Limited” severity.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://religion.masto.host/about">religion.masto.host</a> blocks infosec.exchange at the “Suspended” level, but does not explain why (“Reason not available”).</p>
<p>
Although those servers could, in turn, be blocked by others, no such blocks appear in the block lists of my immediate server neighborhood.</p>
 &gt; select count(*) from blocking_servers(100) where blocked_server = 'weatherishappening.net'
+-------+
| count |
+-------+
| 0     |
+-------+

&gt; select count(*) from blocking_servers(100) where blocked_server = 'religion.masto.host'
+-------+
| count |
+-------+
| 0     |
+-------+
 
<p>
There is another switch hitter in my neighborhood, though. <a href="https://c.im">c.im</a> is blocked by <a>me.dm</a> and <a href="https://octodon.social">octodon.social</a>.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/blocked-and-blocking2.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>
Why?</p>
<p>
me.dm (Medium) has “Suspended” c.im for “Hate speech”.</p>
<p>
octodon.social has “Suspended” c.im for “Reason not available”.</p>
<p>
When the opinions and policies of your server differ from those of mine, we see different realities through our respective lenses. Could such fragmentation drive the fediverse-curious back into arms of Big Social? I’m sure that will happen — indeed is happening — to some degree.</p>
<p>
But I hope that some of us, at least, will learn to thrive in diverse networks of online communities, aware of the kaleidoscopic interplay of filters but not overwhelmed by it. That skill  will serve us well IRL too. To acquire it, we’ll need to visualize the operation of our filters. One great way to do that: SQL queries that drive relationship graphs.</p>

Either they struggled to launch their product, or failed to drive adoption of their product once in market. However, a handful of others show early signs of promising success.</p><p>So I thought I’d document the differences I’ve seen between the fizzles and the sizzles. Spoiler alert: the single biggest predictor of success is simply product execution. It’s the simple stuff like knowing the problem you’re solving, building a good product to solve it, and capturing value with a sustainable business model. Building an IDtech product is hard — the tactics below are ones that I’ve seen used to improve the odds of success for a myriad of IDtech products.</p><blockquote>If you’re interested in diving into more tactical insights from successes and failures from IDtech builders themselves, check out our&nbsp;<a href="http://trinsic.id/podcast">podcast</a>!</blockquote> Common Product Form&nbsp;Factors <p>Most successful IDtech companies you’ll find have similarities in terms of the products they’re developing. These similarities tend to bridge technical approaches (e.g. built using web2 vs web3), industries, and use&nbsp;cases.</p>  End-user app (product for Holder)<br>Usually, IDtech products are built for people — and those people need a way to manage their identity and consent to data being shared. But some IDtech products target organizations or IoT devices, too (collectively, the “end-user”). This is often called a “Wallet App” or an “ID Wallet”. Decisions about these products, such as whether a mobile app or web app will be developed, depend heavily on the use&nbsp;case.  Identity wallet apps can vary greatly in user experience depending on its intended end user and purpose. Above are three examples of identity wallets from three IDtech companies: ZADA, Dentity, and Yoma (from left to right). Although shown on mobile devices, wallets can bridge mobile, web, browser, and&nbsp;more.  Ecosystem tools (product(s) for Issuers/Verifiers)<br>Creating an ecosystem around the end-user is vital to the success of any IDtech company. After all, an ID wallet is only useful if there is somewhere to use it. Some IDtech companies offer a free end-user product and charge the rest of the ecosystem for the tools to interact with those users, making these ecosystem tools the primary revenue model. We’ve seen various kinds of ecosystem tools successfully generate revenue, such as dashboards, workflow builders, verification landing pages (e.g. for things like OIDC or offline verification), curation &amp; governance services, APIs for integrating solutions into existing systems, and&nbsp;more.  Industry- or use case-specific integrations<br>Many successful IDtech companies begin by targeting a specific industry or use case. The more targeted the vertical, the easier it is to integrate with existing systems and get initial users. For example, an IDtech product for Realtors in the USA can build native integrations with state licensing databases, continuing education (CE) programs, and MLS systems alongside the Realtor’s credentials, offering a much more tailored experience than a generic wallet app ever&nbsp;could.  Provider is the term we at Trinsic use to describe the provider of an IDtech solution/product, which they then offer to an ecosystem of organizations and&nbsp;people. Success Patterns in&nbsp;IDtech <p>While I don’t claim to have a surefire recipe for IDtech product success, I’ve identified several patterns exhibited by successful companies that I hope will prove useful to&nbsp;others.</p> Concise, straightforward messaging <p>Once, I sat down with a venture capitalist to talk about Trinsic (then called Streetcred ID). Midway through the pitch he said, “This sounds like something that could leverage blockchain. Have you looked into that?” to which I responded “Yes, our solution uses a blockchain called Sovrin for anchoring identifiers of issuers.” He looked stunned. “Did you just pitch me a blockchain company without using the word blockchain in the first few minutes?” he asked. Of course, the answer was yes, and Kickstart ended up <a href="https://trinsic.id/streetcred-id-rebrands-to-trinsic-raises-pre-seed-funding/">investing</a>.</p><p>Even more so than investors, customers care about how you can solve their problem, not about the technology you’re using. And when conveying this value, it’s important to do it clearly (without buzzwords or jargon) and concisely. This messaging will look differently for each IDtech product, but here’s a framework I’ve found&nbsp;helpful:</p><p>“_____ enables ______ to use ______ to _________”</p><p>Let’s apply this to a super-successful IDtech company called <a href="https://classpass.com/">Classpass</a>. What do they do for consumers? “Classpassenables people to use a single subscription to access exercise classes all over their city”. What do they do for businesses? “Classpass enables gyms to use a simple integration into their existing booking system to earn additional revenue from the classes they’re already doing.” IDtech companies built using decentralized identity don’t need to be more complicated; take <a href="https://zada.io/">ZADA</a> for example, who has tens of thousands of active users in Southeast Asia. “ZADA enables people to use their health credentials to travel seamlessly in a post-covid world.”</p><p>Teams that nail the messaging of their IDtech solution tend to see better results and get faster adoption. If you have another framework to explain an IDtech product concisely, let me&nbsp;know!</p> Decentralized Identity Leads to Great IDtech&nbsp;Products <p>Despite IDtech products existing for some time, new-age IDtech products inspired by the concept of self-sovereign identity (SSI) are springing up faster than ever to fill gaps that are challenging to fill using the technologies of previous&nbsp;decades.</p><p>While I don’t believe SSI is necessary for IDtech, I do think IDtech products built using SSI/web5 technology have a competitive edge. As I explain in a <a href="https://medium.com/trinsic/blockchain-is-the-least-interesting-thing-about-self-sovereign-identity-75c1b56ce497#5275">previous post</a>, IDtechs built using interoperable technologies give users more choice and usability of their identity earlier (because of the growth of other IDtechs), creating a virtuous cycle with a higher likelihood of customer satisfaction. Not to mention you get a lot out of the box using an infrastructure platform like&nbsp;Trinsic.</p><p>That said, empirically we are seeing proprietary IDtech companies growing much faster than ones based on standardized, interoperable solutions. I think that’s because many of the people building with interoperable solutions are spending far too much time in working group meetings debating governance frameworks or building their own decentralized fairy-tale solution from the ground-up. If SSI stands a chance, the community needs to focus on customers and&nbsp;product.</p> Focus on Your Core Competency <p>This advice isn’t new, but it’s easy to forget. A brief reading of any startup or innovation best practice will tell you to <a href="https://fictivekin.github.io/pmarchive-jekyll//guide_to_startups_part4">focus obsessively on product/market fit</a>, or only do that which makes your “<a href="https://podup.substack.com/p/jeff-bezoss-beer-tasting-analogy">beer taste better</a>”. It’s common sense that 99% of businesses should use AWS instead of buying their own servers, for example. IDtech companies are no different.</p><p>Because most IDtech companies face a <a href="https://a16z.com/book/the-cold-start-problem/">cold start problem</a> as they’re rolling out their solution, it’s critical that as many resources as possible focus on solving that problem. As teams learn about their market, they inevitably need to iterate on their product. If these iterations require refactoring of infrastructure in addition to application changes, the speed of iteration can slow to a snail’s&nbsp;pace.</p><p>Trinsic offers infrastructure for building IDtech products using digital wallets and verifiable credentials. A variety of companies offer infrastructure for identity proofing using government IDs &amp; a selfie. Other companies offer infrastructure for user directories, access management, and login. Savvy teams make wise decisions about the infrastructure they leverage to build their IDtech products upon so they can move fast in solving the most important problems to their business instead of reinventing the&nbsp;wheel.</p> Business Model Shouldn’t Be on the Back&nbsp;Burner <p>For most product teams, it goes without saying that great product execution is a key to success. In some industries, the business model is relatively straightforward (e.g., in SaaS productivity software, most companies charge ~$10/user/month). But because IDtech is still emerging as a category, oftentimes the business model is just as make-or-break as the&nbsp;product.</p><p>We’ve identified several viable business models for IDtech companies — stay tuned for more on that. For now, remember that business model innovation is as important as technology innovation in the world of&nbsp;IDtech.</p> Give Your Product a&nbsp;Name <p>Many IDtech products are given a distinct name to make it more concrete in the eyes of end-users. For example, TravelPass is the name of a product developed by IATA to verify vaccine status of passengers — that’s 10x better than saying “get your digital travel wallet app so you can download your vaccine data” and 100x better than saying “download a self-sovereign agent so you can custody your own verifiable credential containing a cryptographically-signed vaccine attestation.”</p><p>Products like MemberPass, MySudo, MedCreds, FarmerID, and many more use their name to solidify their market positioning to end-users and get adoption&nbsp;faster.</p> Conclusion <p>Building an IDtech product is hard. Acquiring users and driving adoption is harder. Despite this, my optimism for the future of IDtech has never been stronger. IDtech infrastructure companies like <a href="http://trinsic.id/">Trinsic</a> are making it easier than ever to build an IDtech company. IDtech companies are getting better at marketing their products. And more IDtech products are getting adopted, leaving behind a blueprint of what it takes to be successful in such a complicated space as identity.</p><blockquote>For more tactical insights from IDtech builders, remember to check out the Future of Identity&nbsp;<a href="http://trinsic.id/podcast">podcast</a>!</blockquote><p>We’re all still learning about what makes great IDtech products.

<p>I recently got access to the <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/">BlueSky</a> beta, and decided to poke around to see what it's all about. I will save the details of what it is and how I feel about it for a different post. However, one of the first things you do when you sign up is choose a username that exists under the <code>bsky.app</code> domain. I have zero interest in another name rush where everyone tries to claim the shortest username possible, so I went with <code>aaronpk.bsky.app</code> rather than trying to get <code>a</code> or <code>apk</code>.</p>

<p>But, as I was poking around the app and replying to a few people, it just didn't feel like "me" yet. I don't care about renting a name in someone else's space. Yesterday, Jay Graber posted on the BlueSky blog all about supporting <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/3-6-2023-domain-names-as-handles-in-bluesky">custom domains as identities in BlueSky</a>. Naturally I was curious to try this out myself, but there were no technical details available in the blog post.</p>

 
Update: The BlueSky app now supports <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/4-28-2023-domain-handle-tutorial">changing your username to your domain name within the app itself</a>! You no longer need to use the below process! You can use my notes below if you're curious about playing with the API directly in order to build other kinds of integrations.
 

<p>When I opened my BlueSky timeline, I saw a few people mentioning that they had figured out how to do it even before the app supported it natively. I did some digging around, and <a href="https://jik.wtf/">jik</a> pointed me to the right places in the AT Proto docs, and I was able to change my handle to <code>aaronpk.com</code>!</p>

<p>Below are the instructions for how to do this yourself. Please note that these instructions will be made obsolete in a week or two since the BlueSky developers are planning on shipping first class support for custom domains in the app and you won't need to do this workaround for long.</p>

 Overview 

<p>The rough process for this is:</p>

 
 Create a DNS TXT record on your domain with the value of your underlying BlueSky ID 
 Get a token for your account (e.g. "log in" to your account from an HTTP client) 
 Update your profile with your new domain 
 

<p>Note: To make these POST requests, you'll need an HTTP client that can POST in JSON format. You can use cURL, httpie, Postman, or write code in whatever language you want. I'll use <a href="https://httpie.io/">httpie</a> for the examples.</p>

 Get a token for your account 

<p>First, you need to "log in" to your account. This process will return an access token you can use to update your profile. Logging in will also tell you your DID, the unique identifier for your underlying account. (The "handle" on your account is more like a display name, and that's how your account can end up being portable across domains as well as BlueSky servers later.)</p>

<p>Call the <a href="https://atproto.com/lexicons/com-atproto-server#comatprotoservercreatesession">com.atproto.server.createSession</a> method with your email and password you used to sign up. (Type this all on one line, I've just split it into multiple lines for readability. Also, again, if you're using cURL or another HTTP client, make sure you send this payload as JSON, not form-encoded.)</p>

 <code>http post https://bsky.social/xrpc/com.atproto.server.createSession
            identifier=user@example.com password=hunter2
</code> 

<p>The response will be a JSON document with your access token as well as DID:</p>

 <code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 609
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Date: Tue, 07 Mar 2023 15:29:38 GMT
ETag: W/"261-15oNf47+gL0kDnvlsvzpUK0ocx8"
X-Powered-By: Express

{
    "accessJwt": "eyJh...",
    "did": "did:plc:s2koow7r6t7tozgd4slc3dsg",
    "handle": "aaronpk.bsky.app",
    "email": "aaron@parecki.com",
    "refreshJwt": "eyJh..."
}
</code> 

 Create a DNS Record 

<p>Go to your domain registrar and create a new TXT record on your domain.</p>

 
 Subdomain: <code>_atproto</code> 
 Value: <code>did=did:plc:XXXXXXXXX</code> 
 TTL: Default 
 

<p>In my case, the domain I wanted to use is <code>aaronpk.com</code>, so I would create a new subdomain <code>_atproto.aaronpk.com</code>, with the value <code>did=did:plc:s2koow7r6t7tozgd4slc3dsg</code>.</p>

 <code>_atproto.aaronpk.com TXT did=did:plc:s2koow7r6t7tozgd4slc3dsg
</code> 

 Update your Profile 

<p>Wait a little while to make sure the DNS entry takes effect. Then you can update your profile with your new domain by running the <a href="https://atproto.com/lexicons/com-atproto-identity#comatprotoidentityupdatehandle">com.atproto.identity.updateHandle</a> method.</p>

<p>Use the value of the <code>accessJwt</code> you got from the first request. (Again, type this out all on one line.)</p>

 <code>http post https://bsky.social/xrpc/com.atproto.identity.updateHandle 
      Authorization:"Bearer eyJ..." 
      handle=aaronpk.com 
</code> 

<p>You won't see a response, but that means it worked! Next time you open the app, you'll probably see a bunch of errors. So log out of the app, and log back in! Right now, you'll need to use your email address to log in instead of your handle, but they are going to fix that in a future update.</p>

<p>Now you should see your new domain as your handle in the BlueSky app!</p>

<p></p>

<p>Once again, this will all be obsolete once they ship this feature in the app itself! Here's a sneak peek from Paul of what the interface will look like!</p>

<p></p>

 More Fun 

<p>Once you've got this far, you can start to use the API for some other fun things!</p>

<p>Verifiable Credentials for Enhanced Supply Chain Traceability, Security, &amp; Resilience</p><p>Transmute uses verifiable credentials (VCs) + decentralized identifiers (DIDs) to create cost effective supply chain data security at scale. Using VCs + DIDs together harnesses the benefits of centralization while eliminating the downsides.</p> The Drawbacks of Blockchain <p>Blockchains are an incredible innovation, but they’re not a one-size-fits-all solution.</p><p>In their current state, blockchains are a heavy and over-engineered tool for the job at hand when it comes to bridging data silos in global&nbsp;trade.</p> Blockchains have a high cost for creation and maintenance.   Blockchains are expensive in public and private form, often gobbling up the margins of commodities they are being used to&nbsp;secure.   Blockchains are difficult to&nbsp;scale.   Blockchains don’t scale well enough for reliable enterprise use, including large supply chain companies or large regulatory and customs agencies. Blockchains may require layer 2 solutions to meet these&nbsp;needs.   Blockchains lack interoperability.   Blockchains aren’t interoperable with existing infrastructure or each other. To achieve interoperability, blockchains require additional adapters or layer 2 investments. Additionally, the cryptography many of them rely on is still considered very emergent and may not meet certain regulatory requirements. For instance, <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-186.pdf">updated NIST requirements</a> only recently allowed for an element used in Bitcoin and Ethereum to be used in blockchain applications.   The Benefits of VCs +&nbsp;DIDs <p>Applied correctly, VCs + DIDs are affordable, interoperable, and already standardized. The interoperability perks of VCs + DIDs give you the ability to work across existing systems, including distributed ledgers (DLTs) and blockchains. Using VCs + DIDs is a futureproof method to fortify supply chain data, using the right tool for the&nbsp;job.</p>  Using VCs + the appropriate DIDs provide the security benefits of decentralization and the efficiency benefits of centralization. Decentralization benefits include immutable claims and tamper evidence, while centralization benefits include scalability.  Implemented by experts like Transmute, VCs + DIDs awaken superpowers — such as data portability, data minimization, and selective disclosure — without locking you into a single vendor or blockchain.  <p><a href="https://medium.com/@karylfowler">Karyl Fowler</a>, Transmute co-Founder and CEO, is an expert in emerging tech and economic development in fields with high regulatory burdens such as FDA, HIPAA and ITAR.

<p>
In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2023/01/16/mastodon-relationship-graphs/">Mastodon relationship graphs</a> I showed how to use Steampipe to <a href="https://steampipe.io/blog/release-0-18-0">map Mastodon network neighborhoods</a>. When I use the word map here, I’m channeling Denis Wood’s <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/26399801">The Power of Maps</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Every map shows this … but not that, and every map shows what it shows this way … but not the other way. Not only is this inescapable but it is precisely because of this interested selectivity — this choice of word or sign or aspect of the world to make a point — that the map is enabled to work.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The aspect chosen by those neighborhood maps is the boost — the Mastodon version of a retweet. <a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/mastodon-boosts-from-selected-server.png">One of the maps</a> focuses on a selected instance that appears in the home timeline. It shows people who belong to that instance and who boost toots from people on the same or different instances. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/mastodon-boosts-server-to-server.png">The other map</a> zooms out to show boost relationships among all the instances that appear in the home timeline. This view wouldn’t be legible if it included people, so it omits them in order to focus on server-to-server relationships.</p>
<p>
These maps represent (or as Denis Wood emphasizes, “re-present”) a set of toots. They omit original toots to which nobody replies, and they also omit replies, in order to focus on boost relationships. What about replies? That would be a different map, one that might also be interesting to draw.</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, though, I’ve come up with another map to display the tags that appear in the results of a Mastodon tag search, along with the accounts that use those tags. It proved its worth today when I was looking for perspectives on Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. As you’ve likely noticed, the US Supreme Court is reconsidering Section 230. My understanding of the topic wasn’t current, I wanted to refresh it, and I especially wanted to test whether Mastodon could provide a useful alternative to a conventional web search. </p>
<p>
One affordance that Mastodon provides: search for toots that use the #Section230 tag. Here are two ways to map the results of that search.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/section230.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>
On the left is a conventional Mastodon view: a list of toots that match the query. In this case the article I ultimately wanted to read appears way down in that list. The <a href="https://elk.zone/mastodon.social/@themarkup@mastodon.themarkup.org/109925750471340463">toot</a> that announced it was from <a href="https://themarkup.org/">The Markup</a>, “a nonprofit newsroom that investigates how powerful institutions are using technology to change our society.” The article, <a href="https://themarkup.org/hello-world/2023/02/25/section-230-is-a-load-bearing-wall-is-it-coming-down">Section 230 Is a Load-Bearing Wall — Is It Coming Down?</a>, transcribes part of a conversation with two legal scholars whom I know to be reliable guides to Net-related issues.</p>
<p>
On the right is my Steampipe-based Mastodon tag explorer. Working with the same data, it surfaced The Markup’s article in a way that brought it immediately to my attention. The first thing that caught my eye was the conjunction of two tags: #section230 and #scotus. Since the Supreme Court’s interest in Section 230 is what’s driving the current news cycle, I wanted to hear from legal scholars qualified to discuss the Court’s interest in Section 230. So the tag conjunction was a significant landmark.</p>
<p>
The map displayed two nodes that connect to both #section230 and #scotus. How did I choose between them? My prior familiarity with The Markup led me to click on that node and visit the Markup’s <a href="https://mastodon.themarkup.org/public/local">Mastodon instance</a> where I read the article. </p>
<p>
Had I been following The Markup then, as I am now, I would likely have seen the article on the <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2023/02/14/news-in-the-fediverse/">news list</a> to which I’ve assigned The Markup’s account. But that wouldn’t have changed the experience of searching for the #section230 tag. The relationship graph works by reformulating the results of that search. It omits the text of toots that contain the tag, and the images in those toots, in order to highlight two aspects of the result list: people (or accounts) and tags. It contextualizes those tags by charting their relative frequency in the result list. And it attaches, to each tag node, a link to a new graph focused on that tag. </p>
<p>
This “interested selectivity” enables the map to do its work: find accounts that use given tags. Like a tag node, an account nodes provides a link — in this case, to the account’s Mastodon home page. It also reports the accounts’ description using a property that appears when hovering the node. So if I were unfamiliar with The Markup I could reveal its description without leaving the graph. Here’s the query that adds that property to the node.</p>
 select
  note
from 
  mastodon_search_account
where 
  query = 'https://mastodon.themarkup.org/@themarkup'

+---------------------+
| note                |
+---------------------+
|  Watching Big Tech. |
+---------------------+
 
<p>
That query is embedded in another query that joins across two Steampipe plugins: one that <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-mastodon">wraps the Mastodon API</a> and another that <a href="https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/rss">queries RSS feeds</a>. That’s because, as noted in <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2022/12/06/mastodon-steampipe-and-rss/">Mastodon, Steampipe, and RSS</a>, the RSS feeds that Mastodon provides for tags enrich the results available from the core API.</p>
<p>
Enabling SQL to query diverse APIs in a common way is one of Steampipe’s core superpowers. Enabling such queries to form the nodes and edges of relationship graphs is another. Used together, these two superpowers enable maps that select what is helpful, omit what isn’t, and thus “re-present” information for a given purpose.</p>

The first post, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/10/19/idtech-is-the-new-fintech/?sh=3553171a3a88">IDtech is the New Fintech</a> is available to read on Forbes, and the second post, <a href="https://medium.com/trinsic/intro-to-idtech-how-decentralized-identity-will-be-adopted-2a3fb9abf6bb">Intro to IDtech: How Decentralized Identity Will be Adopted</a>, can be found here on my&nbsp;Medium.</p><p>If you’ve been following the SSI space over the last few months, it’s likely you’ve seen the term “IDtech” used to describe the product or “application layer” of the cutting-edge identity standards like verifiable credentials. I have <a href="https://medium.com/trinsic/has-ssis-identity-problem-been-solved-2d33490315ae">spoken at length</a> about this term, whether that is on <a href="https://twitter.com/rileyphughes">Twitter</a>, via <a href="https://trinsic.id/">Trinsic</a>, or through my <a href="https://trinsic.id/podcast/">podcast</a>, because I believe it can do for identity products what ‘FinTech’, ‘EdTech’, or ‘Medtech’ do for those categories of products.</p><p>The more I’ve seen IDtech used, the more I see three misconceptions cropping up into conversations.</p><p>❌ IDtech is a rebrand of SSI or decentralized identity.</p><p>❌ IDtech is overly&nbsp;broad.</p><p>❌ IDtech is a new category.</p><p>But before I address these misconceptions, I think it is worth clarifying what IDtech&nbsp;is.</p> How Can You Tell an IDtech Product When You See&nbsp;One? <p>Let’s start with a definition from a <a href="https://medium.com/trinsic/intro-to-idtech-how-decentralized-identity-will-be-adopted-2a3fb9abf6bb">previous&nbsp;post</a>:</p><blockquote>IDtech is the name for the category of products that empower users to take control of their identity, share their data safely, and more securely access the things they&nbsp;need.</blockquote><p>The most important thing to understand about IDtech is that it’s a word to describe a kind of product (as opposed to a philosophy, concept, or technology). Therefore, the first way to tell whether you’re talking about IDtech is to determine whether you’re talking about a tangible product that solves a problem for customers, or potential customers. Booked revenue is an indication that something has moved beyond “use case” and beyond “business case” into a full-fledged product.</p><blockquote>If a fintech product helps you manage your money, an IDtech product helps you manage your identity and&nbsp;data.</blockquote><p>It may be just as helpful to call out the things that don’t help you identify&nbsp;IDtech.</p>  The form factor doesn’t matter. Many IDtech products are mobile apps, while others are web-based, and others live in a browser extension or smart&nbsp;watch.  The tech stack (e.g. use of web3 or blockchain) doesn’t matter either. Because IDtech describes a kind of product, not a technical approach, developers can draw from technologies in web2, web3, or web5 or (any number of future webs) to build their solutions.  The industry vertical is also irrelevant. While I’ve seen IDtech companies in regulated industries like healthcare, finance, and government, I’ve seen adoption succeed in other areas as&nbsp;well.  <p>Hopefully the stage is set and we all agree on what IDtech is. Now we can dive in to three common misconceptions.</p> Misconception #1: IDtech Is a Rebrand of Self-sovereign Identity or Decentralized Identity <p>I understand why this misconception exists. Given that my background and company is in the SSI and decentralized identity space, it is easy to see why people associate the term IDtech to those things when I use it. However, I consider anything that meets the two criteria of 1) empowering users with identity and 2) it is productized to fall under the broad IDtech umbrella. Products in this umbrella include things from <a href="http://dentity.com/">Dentity</a> to <a href="http://clearme.com/">Clear</a> to <a href="http://axuall.com/">Axuall</a> to <a href="http://classpass.com/">Classpass</a> to <a href="http://getportabl.com/">Portabl</a>. Decentralization is not a binary; and these products all sit on a bit of a different spot on the spectrum of self-sovereignty — some are fully custodial while others are totally centralized.</p><p>At the risk of sounding like a broken record (I recently wrote a <a href="https://medium.com/trinsic/has-ssis-identity-problem-been-solved-2d33490315ae">whole post</a> about this), self-sovereign identity is a concept or an ideal. Decentralized identity generally refers to a set of technologies. But IDtech refers to a class of product — or said another way, the set of solutions to a particular problem.</p><p>All that being said, my personal belief is that in the long run, the winning IDtech products will be built using decentralized identity and will get users closer to self-sovereignty.</p> Misconception #2: IDtech Is Overly&nbsp;Broad <p>Another misconception is that IDtech is too broad of a term. Usually this stems from a belief that IDtech encompasses everything from <a href="http://okta.com/">Okta</a> to <a href="http://equifax.com/">Equifax</a> to <a href="http://onfido.com/">Onfido</a> to <a href="http://entidad.io/">Entidad</a>. In reality, the only one of these I classify as an IDtech product is Entidad. Okta is an authentication infrastructure. Onfido is a verification widget. Equifax is a data aggregator. In fact, I’m aware of an IDtech product that uses Okta, Onfido, and Equifax together to achieve a particular user experience in their&nbsp;product.</p> Misconception #3: IDtech Is a New&nbsp;Category <p>Again, IDtech describes products that empower users to take control of their identity, share their data safely, and more securely access the things they need. These kinds of products have been around for decades. So despite the word only recently beginning to be used, products that fit this description are not&nbsp;new.</p><p>Dozens of IDtech products like those offered by <a href="http://clearme.com/">Clear</a>, <a href="https://www.merits.com/">Merit</a>, and <a href="https://airsidemobile.com/">Airside</a> were started over the last few decades, streamlining millions of consumers’ lives. Like the FinTech companies started in the early 2000s before open banking or fintech infrastructure, early IDtech companies had to blaze a trail of proprietary technology themselves. Fortunately, today decentralized identity represents a new way to build IDtech products — and infrastructure platforms such as Trinsic make it easier than ever. What used to take a whole team, millions of dollars, and years to build can now be done in a matter of weeks. So it’s easy to see why a surge of new-age IDtech companies are rising to the occasion.</p> IDtech Is About to Have Its&nbsp;Moment <p>Although IDtech is not a rebrand of “SSI” or “decentralized identity”, these technologies do check a lot of the boxes good IDtech products hope to achieve. And IDtech infrastructure companies (like Trinsic) that utilize SSI technologies are making it easier than ever to build IDtech products that serve specific industries or use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>An explosion of IDtech products is currently underway showing that IDtech is indeed the new Fintech. This revolution in identity products will transform how identity works today and make the world more accessible for&nbsp;all.</p><p>These ideas continue to develop. If you have feedback for me, or if you’re building an IDtech product, I’d love to hear from you — my DMs are open on <a href="https://twitter.com/rileyphughes">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rileyparkerhughes/">LinkedIn</a>. You should also check out <a href="http://trinsic.id">Trinsic</a>, the best infrastructure for building IDtech products. If this post was insightful, please share it with others that will learn from it, and follow me so you don’t miss subsequent posts where I’ll dive deeper into the concepts and practices behind successful IDtech products.</p>

  I've had a busy month. Something had to drop and it was regular updates here. Hopefully I’m back to a more regular schedule now. Technological change is messy and hard to predict. Still we can look at the direction in which digital identity is evolving to get an idea what's coming—even if we can't predict the timing.

Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.</p>       <p>Riley Hughes and I recently had a conversation about the question "why doesn't SSI exist already?" Sometimes the question is asked because people think it's such a natural idea that it's surprising that it's not the norm. Other times, the question is really a statement "if this were really a good idea, it would exist already!" Regardless of which way it's asked, the answer is interesting since it's more about the way technology develops and is adopted than the technology itself.</p><p>Riley calls identity products "extremely objectionable" meaning that there are plenty of reasons for people to object to them including vendor lock-in, privacy concerns, security concerns, and consumer sentiment. I think he's right. You're not asking people and companies to try a new app (that they can easily discard if it doesn't provide value). You're asking them to change the fundamental means that they use to form, manage, and use online relationships.</p> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0BS2H4HT1/technometria-20">   </a> <p>The last chapter of my new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0BS2H4HT1/technometria-20">Learning Digital Identity</a>, makes a case that there is an existing identity <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2022/02/life_is_a_metasystem.shtml">metasystem</a> that I label the Social Login (SL) metasystem. The SL metasystem is supported by OpenID Connect and the various "login in with..." identity providers. The SL metasystem is widely used and has provided significant value to the online world.</p><p>There is also an emerging Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) metasystem based on DIDs and verifiable credentials. I evaluate each in terms of <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/01/the_laws_of_identity.shtml">Kim Cameron’s Laws of Identity</a>. In this evaluation, the SL metasystem comes out pretty good. I believe this accounts for much of its success. But it fails in some key areas like not supporting directed (meaning not public) identifiers. As a result of these failings, SLM has not been universally adoptable. Banks, for example, aren’t going to use Google Signin for a number of reasons.</p><p>The SSI Metasystem, on the other hand, meets all of Cameron’s Laws. Consequently, I think it will eventually be widely adopted and gradually replace the SL metasystem. The key word being eventually. The pace of technological change leads us to expect that change will happen very quickly. Some things (like the latest hot social media app) seem to happen overnight. But infrastructural change, especially when it requires throwing out old mental models about how things should work is much slower. The fact is, we’ve been building toward the ideas in SSI (not necessarily the specific tech) for several decades. Work at IIW on user-centric identity led to the SL metasystem. But the predominant mental model of that metasystem didn't change much from the one-off centralized accounts people used before. You still get an account administrated bythe relying party, they've just outsourced the authentication to someone else. (Which means another party is intermediating the relationship). Overcoming that mental model, especially with entrenched interests, is a long slog.</p><p>In the 80s and 90s (pre-web) people were only online through the grace of their institution (university or company). So, I was <code>windley@cs.ucdavis.edu</code> and there was no reason to be anything else. When the web hit, I needed to be represented (have an account) in dozens or hundreds of places with whom I no longer had a long term relationship (like employee or student). So, we moved the idea of an account from workstation operating systems to the online service. And became Sybill.</p><p>When Kim first introduced the Laws of Identity, I literally didn’t understand what he as saying. I understood the words but not the ideas. Certainly not the ramifications. I don’t think many did. He’s the first person I know who understood the problems and set out a coherent set of principles to solve them. We <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2008/12/azigos_remindme_service.shtml">used Infocards in our product at Kynetx</a> and they worked pretty well. But because of how they were rolled out, people came to associate them strictly with Microsoft. The SL metasystem won out, offering the benefits of federation, without requiring that people, developers, or companies change their mental model.</p><p>Changing metasystems isn't a matter of technology. It's a social phenomenon. Consequently it's slow and messy. Here's my answer to the question "why doesn't this exist yet?" The arc of development for digital identity systems has been bending toward user-controlled, decentralized digital identity for decades. That doesn't mean that SSI, as currently envisioned, is inevitable. Just that something like it, that better complies with Kim's laws than the current metasystem, is coming. Maybe a year from now. Maybe a decade. No one can say. But it's coming. Plan and work accordingly.</p><p></p>   <p>Thanks for reading Phil Windley's Technometria!

<p>Blockchain is one of the fastest-growing technologies in the world. Most companies are trying to implement the scope of blockchain for the growth of their business. Therefore, they are looking for skilled blockchain developers who would help them to execute new technologies and to update their existing systems so that they can ensure growth in the market.</p>



<p>As blockchain is revolutionizing the world, there is a huge demand for blockchain developers. Without them, it is not possible to utilize the <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/feature/Top-10-benefits-of-blockchain-technology-for-business">benefits of blockchain technology</a>. The developers are responsible for all the research on the blockchain and the execution of the benefits of blockchain. Developers will be responsible for building the system’s architecture, creating smart contracts, as well as optimizing the protocols. As they need to handle a lot of responsibilities, they need to have certain skills.</p>


 
 


 
 Cryptography 
 



<p>To offer a safe blockchain environment, cryptography is very important. Therefore blockchain developers must have a good understanding of cryptographic practices and concepts including crypto keys, wallets, and digital signatures. Cryptography is a crucial element in ensuring the security and trustworthiness of the Bitcoin network and other cryptocurrencies. Such highly secure crypto is easily accessible with trading bots like bitcode prime. According to <a href="https://www.etf-nachrichten.de/autotrading/bitcode-prime/">bitcode prime test 2023</a>, it is designed to help users trade a wide range of cryptocurrencies on various markets in the cryptocurrency industry. Developers must have the knowledge to make use of public-key cryptography to avoid unauthorized access. They should also understand the dissimilarities between the different cryptographic hash functions such as Keccak-256 and SHA-256.</p>



 
 Blockchain architecture 
 



<p>Blockchain developers must have a good idea about the way blockchain works and its architecture. They should also know concepts like a consensus, smart contracts, distributed ledgers, and others that are very important in the functioning of blockchain technology. They should also know the four basic types of blockchain architecture – private, public, consortium, and hybrid.</p>



 
 Data Structures 
 



<p>The presence of data structures is an unavoidable part of the whole blockchain network. Every block is a data structure type that gathers all the transactions specifically for the public ledger. Blockchain developers must study data structures thoroughly and should understand the way blockchain network makes use of data structure. Developers must also understand the different types of data structures like heaps, graphs, Merkle trees, Patricia trees, and hash trees.</p>



 
 Smart Contracts 
 



<p>Smart contracts allow two parties to transfer services and goods without any intermediaries. Smart contracts are a predominant factor while implementing blockchains. Therefore, developers must be familiar with these smart contracts and how they can be used for business. They should also know the programming languages that are widely used in the execution of smart contracts like Chaincode, Solidity, or Vyper.</p>


 
 


 
 Web development 
 



<p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/web-development/">Web development</a> is very important as blockchain gives high importance to decentralized applications. Therefore developers must have good skills in web development like designing and developing web applications, technologies that back them up, and the steps that can be taken for the optimization and security of these applications.</p>



 
 Programming languages 
 



<p>Various programming languages are used by the blockchain technologies and will be different according to the platforms used to execute the blockchain environment. Developers need not be experts in all the languages, but they should have some basic knowledge of some of the popular languages like Python, C++, or JavaScript. It is also good if the developers have some idea of object-oriented programming.</p>

  Probably not but at there end there are 10 ways to prevent assumptions becoming culture <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Post the 2008 global financial crisis, the president of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, said in an opening address at the ECB Central Banking Conference Frankfurt, 18 November 2010, “<a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2010/html/sp101118.en.html">As a policymaker during the crisis, I found the available models of limited help. In fact, I would go further: In the face of the crisis, we felt abandoned by conventional tools</a>.”</p><br><p></p><br> The Gap <p>Many in executive and leadership positions have faced for a while a feeling that our models, simulations and computations are ill-suited to addressing big, messy, complicated real-world problems. There is a gap between the reality we read and measure today and the model that predicted today a short period ago. &nbsp; Since we have yet to create new models and continue to utilise the same ideals, we know there is a gap between prediction and reality, and that gap is leading to poor decisions, which make us see a bigger gap.&nbsp;</p><p>Decisions based on models today have short and long-term consequences. Poor decisions because of broken models lead to us missing an agreed performance metric and impact our children as they live with choices removed and unintended outcomes.&nbsp;</p><p>It is accepted by some commentators that <a href="https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/glossary/utility-maximisation/">utility maximisation</a> (the economic concept) is a poor way to navigate uncertainty.&nbsp; The reason is that uncertainty means you cannot be sure you are optimising for the best thing in the short and long term. The map and directions our economic models provide cannot deliver a compass for wicked problems such as climate change and pandemics.&nbsp;</p><p>A reason our models fail may be that they start with the wrong outcome preference, framing and assumption, which over time are transformed to no longer be preferences, framings and assumptions but beliefs and culture, and we cannot change them before they break — path dependency.&nbsp; An assumption our utility maximisation economic model took a while back was to value the time of humans unequally (discrimination), and now technology laboured to convert the earth's unvalued natural resources. With this model, humanity ignores the consequences of previous generations' assumptions because they are now cultural, which we experience as differing views on the environment, society and climate.</p> Does system thinking break at earth scale? <p>Many of our complex models start with a decomposition ideal to break apart complexity into small discrete components that we find we can model and explore. However, even our understanding of atoms, once the most fundamental building block, actually contains secrets that we still can't fathom; such is the joy of quantum mechanics.&nbsp; As we break things apart, we break connections we did not know existed, and so we cannot recombine the components and make what we started with.</p><p>Components don't combine to make the hole. I can put all your chemistry in a bucket, but it will not make you.&nbsp;</p><p>If our model depends on the complete understanding of the smallest part and that the understanding is perfect and precise, then when doubt arises or the proof comes that this smallest part is not what we assumed, why do we think that the model will retain its ability to provide precise prediction?&nbsp; When we study our smallest component parts in isolation, what linkages were there to other parts that we did not observe?</p><p>Our systems thinking and models depend on a form of separation, boundary, and interface that help us detail how these small components interact.&nbsp; We have a duality of issue insomuch that if our understanding of the smaller part is not right and we also make an error in the dependencies about how this small part interacts, effects, affects and connects to other small parts, we end up with non-linear errors in our models.&nbsp; Exponential (non-linear) errors, just like exponential growth, get big very quickly.&nbsp;</p><p>There is a branch of thinking that retains the idea that we will get a large-scale model right because we should be able to model each small basic component part and the dependency between all parts, but we face a dichotomy that we don't know that if the whole can be represented by the parts, because of variables in time delays and the emergence of new recursive loops in the system, which is why our system thinking breaks at earth's scale. At scale, the earth is not a static model but a dynamic living, moving, changing and adapting system of systems.&nbsp; The earth is adopting (not learning), and today's system creates a dynamic change that means tomorrow's system has different dependencies. &nbsp; Our decisions impact and direct that change.</p><p>In the small backwater of behaviours, economics and social psychology, there is a discipline called anthropology, the study of human behaviours, which searches for differences and how these tiny one-off behaviours and ideas may be the future and may scale. Hidden in plain sight among all the noise and hubris is the new dynamic changes, which means that our understanding of the small parts and the dependency must adapt continually, or we must recognise that small errors at scale will give false conclusions. It is not that the emerging feedback loop existed when it started; it was created because of the dynamic nature of complex systems. &nbsp; We lack right now the tools to create such new dynamic loops. This means that all our models are wrong; we just don't know by how much.</p><p>We lack right now the tools to create such new dynamic loops. This means that all our models are wrong; we just don't know by how much.</p><p>Just because all models are wrong, that does not mean they are not useful, but it does mean we need all models and cannot align to only one when we are dealing with issues at the earth scale.&nbsp; This implies that 1.5 degrees are both right and wrong, as is 3.5 degrees.&nbsp; Indeed the idea that any temperature is right or wrong is naive. Further, any one metric that we use as a tool for complex decision-making is going to be wrong.&nbsp;</p> Decisions based on metrics. <p>The consequence of the maximisation theory that drives our model has ignored or unvalued some cost. It also maximises for a single outcome, which is never possible.&nbsp; This means that the opposite side of that coin is true, that there will always be an overstatement of revenue and margin that can lead to false intentions.</p><p>We are drawn to decisions not based on costs but on the increment between revenue and costs (margin); we shortcut the complexity of the model to a single figure, ROI. Just like temperature in climate models. ROI decisions based on only costs do not exist and, therefore, as a viewpoint, it is discounted - reinforcing culture/ framing and mindset. ROI will always fail as a decision tool as there will always be undervalued costs and hurdles that mean we stretch the assumptions, but we love the idea of boling complexity down to a simple linear narrative.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Can models navigate uncertainty, probably not, but they are the best tool we have.&nbsp; Assuming they are a true compass is a dangerous game, especially if we have a culture that means we cannot challenge the model itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I suppose here is the reality, system thinking will fail at the earth scale because assumptions become culture, and we don’t have any examples that culture changes before it breaks.&nbsp; If the model cannot be challenged, we will have to wait until it breaks.</p><p>We don’t have any examples that culture changes before it breaks.<br><br></p> Leadership can stop assumptions from becoming culture <p>Assumptions can become part of a culture when they are repeated and reinforced over time, often without questioning or examining their accuracy or relevance.&nbsp; Assumptions become a part of culture when they are widely held and perpetuated through social norms and values.</p><p>To prevent assumptions from becoming entrenched in the company culture, it's important that leadership take steps to challenge and question them, as well as to actively promote more inclusive and open-minded ways of thinking.</p><p>So we we asked ChatGPT for some specific recommendations on how to prevent assumptions becoming culture; we will leave it up to you to judge.</p><p>ChatGPT please give some specific steps that can help prevent assumptions from becoming a culture?</p>  <p>Encourage critical thinking: Promote a culture of critical thinking and encourage people to challenge assumptions and beliefs that are taken for granted. This can help to break down the barriers that prevent people from questioning assumptions and can lead to more open-minded and inclusive thinking.</p>  <p>Encourage and promote diversity: Encourage diversity in all forms, whether it's through hiring practices, community events, or other initiatives. This can help to break down stereotypes and promote understanding across different cultures and perspectives by exposing people to a wider range of perspectives and experiences.</p>  <p>Foster open communication: Create a culture of open communication where people feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and ideas without fear of judgment. This can help to prevent assumptions from becoming entrenched by allowing people to openly question and discuss them.</p>  <p>Educate everyone: Provide education and training on topics such as cultural competency, unconscious bias, and diversity and inclusion. This can help people to become more aware of their own assumptions and biases, and can promote more inclusive thinking. Share your findings and insights with others. Explain why certain assumptions are inaccurate and how they can be harmful. Encourage others to question their assumptions as well.</p>  <p>Lead by example: It's important to lead by example. Model the behavior that you want to see in others by questioning your own assumptions and being open to new perspectives. By doing so, you can help to create a culture where assumptions are not accepted without question, and where people are encouraged to think critically and with an open mind.</p>  <p>Emphasize transparency: Encourage open and honest language, and be transparent about the assumptions that underlie decisions and actions. This can help to build trust and promote accountability.</p>  <p>Continuously assess and evaluate: Regularly review assumptions and cultural norms to determine whether they are still relevant and accurate. This can help to prevent assumptions from becoming outdated or misaligned with current needs and realities.</p>  <p>Be aware of your assumptions: Start by examining your own assumptions and biases. Ask yourself where they come from and whether they are based on evidence or stereotypes. Awareness is the first step in changing behavior.</p>  <p>Challenge assumptions: When you encounter assumptions that don't feel right, question them. Look for evidence that supports or contradicts them. If an assumption is not based on evidence, it should be discarded.</p>  Hold people accountable: Finally, hold people accountable for their assumptions. Call out harmful assumptions when you see them, and encourage others to do the same. Make it clear that assumptions are not acceptable in your culture.

 <p>I have been exploring the research and concepts that bias and trauma are deeply linked.&nbsp; The linkage and directionality are much debated. &nbsp; Trauma creates bias, and equally, bias creates trauma. It would appear that either can be a starting point, but they definitely feed each other, creating complex positive (healing) and negative (detrimental) feedback loops which extend beyond the individual and their immediate relationships to wider society.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p></p><p>Using systems-mapping to address Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) and trauma: A qualitative study of stakeholder experiences&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0273361">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0273361</a></p><br><p>Why does this matter, as all data has a bias?&nbsp;</p><p>Fundamental to a decision-making role based on data is to demand that we recognise bias and try to remove bias; however, I am now thinking that if we remove the bias, we assume there is no trauma, and therefore, everyone will be rational.&nbsp; Yes, there are some big ugly assumptions in that statement, but the purpose here is about the flow of challenging thinking and not academic rigour to prove something we already know.&nbsp;</p><p>In removing the bias, we ignore that bias feeds trauma and that equally, trauma feeds bias; a decision made without this context has no coupling to the reality of the situation.&nbsp; The alternative is that we live with the bias in our data, known and unknown; however, we don't know if the analysis for this person in this situation reflects/ fuels/heals their bias/ trauma or not.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, the framing of removing bias is not valid; equality, a framing that recognises bias, is not valid as it cannot represent the individual.</p><p>Houston, we have a problem. Do we have to reframe bias?</p><p>I am all up for understanding bias, but it has become more evident to me that in my thrust to be curious about bias, I have to accept that I am going to have to operate in a dynamic feedback loop, and it will uncover/ reveal trauma.&nbsp; Revelling trauma or bias crosses the creepy line.&nbsp; The creepy line is a very subjective idea and is different for everyone.&nbsp; When I published “<a href="https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/">My Digital Footprint</a>” back in 2009, I wrote a lot about the creepy line where data collection can be the same, but how you present the data back to the user will either add value or unnerve them.&nbsp; But to know what a user will accept, you test the user's concepts of a creepy line continually to find out when what you are saying becomes unacceptable and back off — deep personalisation.&nbsp; The creepy line and the concepts of privacy are deeply interlinked.&nbsp; Privacy is linked to perceptions of risk, and risk acceptance or adversity equally links to trauma and bias.</p><p>Bias, trauma, risk and privacy matter at both levels, macro and micro, but that is a big rabbit hole where we get into identity, but I am interested here in decision-making.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>What I am left questioning is whether understanding bias is the right thing to do. Conceptually should we spend more time understanding if this bias feeds something OR if this bias is fed by something OR both?&nbsp; Would both provide new insights to help us give the user better choices and make better decisions, or are we edging toward influence and control and, in doing so, remove agency?</p><br><p>&nbsp;CEO Take Away</p><p>Trauma and bias are critical to decision-making. In the board room and leadership executive setting, should we unpack bias and ignore trauma? &nbsp; Bias is easy to talk about, trauma remains “unsaid” - I am not even sure if we assume.&nbsp; The point is, can we use bias as a proxy? Knowing that many CEO’s and founders are driven by trauma, is understanding bias going to take us to a place that will be easier or more difficult to talk about how we make decisions?</p><p>Worth reading <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1048984322000212">CEO childhood trauma, social networks, and strategic risk-taking</a></p><br><p>&nbsp;</p><br><br><br><p>Further reading&nbsp;</p>  <p>CEO early-life disaster experience and corporate social performance <br><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/smj.3293">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/smj.3293</a></p>  <p>CEO Traits and Firm Outcomes: Do Early Childhood Experiences Matter?<br><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3374389">https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3374389</a></p>  <p>The Indirect Effect of Trauma via Cognitive Biases and Self-Disturbances on Psychotic-Like Experiences<br><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.611069/full">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.611069/full</a></p>  <p>Childhood trauma and cognitive biases associated with psychosis: A systematic review and meta-analysis <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7906349/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7906349/</a>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Enhanced Attentional Bias Variability in Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and its Relationship to More General Impairments in Cognitive Control <br><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-15226-7">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-15226-7</a>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Unconscious Cultural Bias Reduction and Trauma-Informed Care <a href="https://www.careinnovations.org/resources/unconscious-cultural-bias-reduction/">https://www.careinnovations.org/resources/unconscious-cultural-bias-reduction/</a></p>  <p>Attention Bias and Metacogniti on: Relationships with Childhood Trauma and Psychological Vulnerability<br><a href="https://research.manchester.ac.uk/files/205623245/FULL_TEXT.PDF">https://research.manchester.ac.uk/files/205623245/FULL_TEXT.PDF</a></p>  <p>Interpretation biases in victims and non-victims of interpersonal trauma and their relation to symptom development <br><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0887618506001332">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0887618506001332</a></p>  <p>Recall Bias in Trauma Recollection <br><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/355928917_Recall_Bias_in_Trauma_Recollection">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/355928917_Recall_Bias_in_Trauma_Recollection</a></p>  <br><br><br><br>

On a recent episode of <a href="https://www.buzzsprout.com/1112270/11934167-baby-jessica-with-blair-braverman">You’re Wrong About</a>, Sarah Marshall delivered a crisp summary of how the 24-hour news cycle came to be. This led me to realize that many among us do not remember when news was confined to time slots: the 7 o’clock news, the 11 o’clock news, the morning paper. I think it might be healthy to bring that back in some form. From the excitement I heard in their voices I gather that Sarah Marshall and her co-presenter Blair Braverman feel the same way. When I hear people complain about Mastodon’s lack of breaking news, I think: “Feature, not bug!” Maybe what the 24-hour cycle has been breaking is us.</p>
<p>
So when <a href="https://press.coop/">press.coop</a> launched today I was a bit conflicted. On the one hand, I would like to use Mastodon to read mainstream news headlines just as I once used RSS to do. (Full disclosure: press.coop is run as a public service by <a href="https://hello.coop">hello.coop</a> whose founder, Dick Hardt, is a longtime friend.) On the other hand, when reading Mastodon timelines I’m enjoying NOT knowing what’s happening in the world right now.</p>
<p>
What if you could exclude news from the home timeline, put it on a list, and go there when — and only when — in a news mindset? That’s a feature of <a href="https://fedilab.app/">the Fedilab client</a>, I learned from <a href="https://twit.social/@ksoltys">Keith Soltys</a>. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/press-coop.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>
What would it take to implement the same idea in the Mastodon reader I’m developing? It couldn’t be just an extra WHERE condition, could it?</p>
<p>
Well, actually, it could.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/news-exclude-timeline.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>
Problem solved. Now I can read news in Mastodon when and how I want, and never see it otherwise.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/mastodon-news-list.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>
If you want that same control, you shouldn’t have to use a particular Android client, or Steampipe client, or any other. There’s a Cambrian explosion of such creatures right now. The more they can share important DNA, the better for all of us.</p>
<p>
I hope that the Steampipe plugin for Mastodon, which enables the dashboards I’m building using Steampipe’s own <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3668032/visualizing-the-hacker-news-api-with-hcl-and-sql.html">dashboards-as-code</a> system, can provide some useful common DNA. A rule like news only on lists, not timelines, once expressed in SQL, can be used (and thus not reinvented) by any kind of Steampipe (read: Postgres) client: psql (or any Postgres CLI), Metabase or Tableau or any Postgres-compatible BI tool, Python or JavaScript or any programming language. Steampipe is a versatile <a href="https://steampipe.io/blog/steampipe-as-component">component</a>. Its mapping from APIs to SQL can, in theory, provide the data layer for any application. </p>
<p>
My Steampipe + Mastodon adventure notwithstanding, let’s hold on to that larger idea. The fediverse is our chance to reboot the social web and gain control of our information diets. Since our diets all differ, it ought to be trivial for anyone — in any client — to turn on a rule like news only on lists, not timelines. I’ve shown one way it can be trivial. Please show me others!</p>

A chatbot answering complex life questions sitting on a mountain — DALL·E&nbsp;2<p>From ChatGPT:</p><p>Digital identity is a complex issue that has not been fully solved due to several challenges and obstacles, some of which&nbsp;include:</p>  Privacy concerns: Digital identity often requires the collection and storage of personal information, which raises privacy concerns and the risk of data breaches. There is a need for a solution that can provide secure and reliable identity verification while also protecting the privacy of individuals.  Interoperability: There are many different systems and protocols for digital identity management, which can make it difficult for these systems to work together seamlessly. This can lead to compatibility issues and difficulties in accessing and sharing information across different platforms and organizations.  Trust and Security: Establishing trust and security in digital identity systems is crucial, as fraudulent activities and identity theft can have serious consequences for both individuals and organizations. Ensuring that digital identity systems are secure and resistant to hacking and fraud requires ongoing investment in research and development.  Regulation: Digital identity is a global issue and different countries have different laws and regulations around data privacy and identity management. This can make it difficult to develop a standardized and universal solution for digital identity.    Technical Complexity: Digital identity involves multiple technologies, such as cryptography, biometrics, and machine learning, which can make it challenging to create a solution that is both secure and user-friendly.  <p>Despite these challenges, there has been progress made in recent years to solve these problems and create more secure and user-friendly digital identity solutions. However, this is an ongoing process that requires collaboration between technology companies, governments, and other stakeholders.</p>

  Installing Ubuntu on a 2010 era iMac hardware

<p>I use a 2010 era 27” iMac as my primary home desktop computer. I have become increasingly frustrated by my inability to update the macOS to versions that support security and privacy features such as Apple’s Advanced Data Protection for iCloud. So I decided to install Ubuntu (Linux) in a dual-boot configuration on this hardware.</p>

<p></p>



<p>As I was researching whether this was even possible, I ran into sometimes conflicting, many times outdated, and often incomplete information, so wanted to document both my configuration and the resources that were helpful to me in the hope that others don’t have to go through much of the uncertainty that I felt when I decided to go down this road.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>TL;DR - Installing Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS (Jammy Jellifish) in a dual boot configuration with macOS High Sierra Version 10.13.6 on a 27” iMac 11,3 (Mid 2010) hardware with an Intel Core i3 CPU was a painless experience and, as of right now, I have been happily running this configuration as my primary home desktop computer with zero problems for close to 3 weeks.</p>
</blockquote>

 Apple hardware 

<p>I like the iMac hardware.</p>

<p>It is clean, does not take up much space, and has been running trouble-free for me since I bought it back in 2010. The following is my hardware configuration:</p>

 ❖ Model Name: iMac (27-inch, Mid 2010)
    ▻ Model Identifier:  iMac11,3
❖ Processor Name: Intel Core i3
    ▻ Processor Speed:  3.2 GHz
    ▻ Number of Processors:  1
    ▻ Total Number of Cores:  2
    ▻ L2 Cache (per Core):  256 KB
    ▻ L3 Cache:  4 MB
❖ Memory:  16 GB 1333 MHz DDR3
❖ Graphics:  ATI Radeon HD 5670 512 MB
❖ Storage:  1 TB SATA Disk
 

<p>It is also connected to the following external peripherals:</p>

 ❖ Dell 27" Monitor (U2719DC)
❖ USB connected Keychron V10 (Alice Layout) QMK Custom Mechanical Keyboard
❖ USB connected Logitech G203 Prodigy Gaming Mouse
❖ Hard line network connection  
 

<p>I am calling out the mention of the keyboard, mouse and network connection as being hard-wired because in my research, the typical complaints regarding the installation of Linux on Apple hardware was related to WiFi network connections and Bluetooth keyboards and mice.</p>

<p>My recommendation to de-complexify your installation would be to ensure that you use hard-line connected devices during the installation phase and once everything is done, swap in your regular devices (My WiFi and Bluetooth are working just fine under Ubuntu; I just don’t use it.)</p>

 Why Ubuntu LTS? 

<p>My selection criteria for a Linux distribution was the following:</p>

 
   It should be stable and it should just work; nothing flashy or fancy 
   When a software or hardware vendor says that it “Supports Linux”, the chosen distribution should be at the top of that list 
   There should be an automated security and maintenance update process 
   Excellent documentation and community support 
   Application support for the majority of my day to day activities, ideally with Linux versions of the same applications 
 

<p>Ubuntu LTS met all of those requirements for me.</p>

<p>In particular the LTS version of Ubuntu which “… stands for long-term support — which means five years of free security and maintenance updates, guaranteed until April 2027” was a make or break selection criteria for me.</p>

 Installation steps 

<p>I spent a substantial amount of time looking thru installation guides on the inter-webs and the best one that I found, and which I used for my installation, was Dan Helyer’s <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/install-linux-macbook-pro/" title="How to Install and Dual Boot Linux on Your Mac">How to Install and Dual Boot Linux on Your Mac</a>. It is well written, with lots of screen shots, and step-by-step instructions that worked very well for me.</p>

<p>I am not going to replicate that here, but instead provide some notes regarding my experience:</p>

 
   This process will not work on Apple Silicon iMacs 
   I followed the dual-boot installation steps 
   The drive partitioning step was an overnight process for me (I allocated 500GB of my 1TB SATA drive to a combination of OS and swap partitions) 
   I did not use the USB installer, but instead simply <a href="https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/burn-a-dvd-on-macos#1-overview" title="How to burn a DVD on macOS">burned the Ubuntu ISO onto a DVD</a> and used that instead 
 

<p>Everything else simply just worked, which I think is a testament to the maturity and polish of the Ubuntu distribution.</p>

 Post-installation configuration 

<p>There were only three steps that were specific to my environment.</p>

 
   
    <p>I use a NAS within my home network to keep content across my various devices synchronized and as my private git server and backup infrastructure. It is then set up to perform regular, automated and encrypted off-site archival of that content. So I simply had to install that client agent on my new system and point it to my internal NAS for all my content to be come back to my new machine. That was an overnight process.</p>
   
   
    <p>By default, Ubuntu uses the bash shell and I prefer the zsh shell. That is a personal preference; I had also spent far too much time getting my terminal “just so” on my mac and did not feel like redoing all that with bash. So I installed zsh and copied the config files that I was using on the iMac over, and everything just came back the way I wanted it to look.</p>
   
   
    <p>My mechanical keyboard supports open source software that allows for a significant amount of customization. So I spent some time looking at the <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/stable/ubuntu-help/shell-keyboard-shortcuts.html.en" title="Ubuntu keyboard shortcuts">keyboard shortcuts available under Ubuntu</a> to remap some of my keys, and create some macros to assign to the custom keys on the keyboard to make my day-to-day tasks a bit easier.</p>
   
 

 Future steps 

<p>I am rather happy with how this turned out, and the new life that my iMac hardware is enjoying.</p>

<p>The one thing I am currently researching is how best to add a fingerprint sensor for both authentication to the local machine as well as a pathway to support Passkeys/FIDO2/WebAuthn. Currently reading about and looking into the YubiKey Bio as a possible way to enable this support.</p>

<p>I hope that my experience and pointers prove useful to other folks who are being given not so subtle signals by the vendor that their hardware has reached end-of-life. The reality is that it has not, and you have very good options available to you to continue using the hardware which is working just fine!</p>

  For the first time, there is now a native JSON Web Token (JWT) representation for Verifiable Credentials. This representation uses IANA-registered JWT claims whenever applicable. Among other improvements and simplifications, this means that we finally have a Verifiable Credentials representation that doesn’t require the use of JSON-LD.

<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/"></a>For the first time, there is now a native JSON Web Token (JWT) representation for Verifiable Credentials.  This representation uses IANA-registered JWT claims whenever applicable.  Among other improvements and simplifications, this means that we finally have a Verifiable Credentials representation that doesn’t require the use of JSON-LD.</p>
<p>The native JWT representation explicitly isn’t a mapping from the VC Data Model.  This mapping in the VC 1.1 specification resulted in ambiguities about whether to duplicate VC Data Model claims in the VC-JWT representation (the “in addition to” option) or whether to delete them from the VC Data Model representation (the “instead of” option).  These ambiguities harmed interoperability.  Rather, the 2.0 VC-JWT representation is its own simpler native JWT data structure.</p>
<p>See the new native JWT VC representation in the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-jwt/#version-2">Version 2 section of the “Securing Verifiable Credentials using JSON Web Tokens” specification</a>.  You can also compare it there to the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-jwt/#version-1.1">Version 1.1 representation</a>, which is a mapping from the VC Data Model with the “in addition to” and “instead of” choices.</p>
<p>This accomplishment is the product of the vision, passion, and perseverance of many advocates of simplifying Verifiable Credentials.  Foremost among them is <a href="https://twitter.com/OR13b">Orie Steele</a> – my co-editor for the VC-JWT specification.  I’ll also observe that the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/vc-jwt/pull/44">pull request creating this functionality</a> had an unprecedented fifteen approvers – an indication of the broad support for this direction for Verifiable Credentials.  I am proud to have played a role in making it happen.</p>

<p>
The Fediverse is wired together by protocols like <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">ActivityPub</a> and <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7033">WebFinger</a> which, as yet, I know very little about. That’s because the Steampipe plugin, which supports the dashboards I’ve been building and describing in this series, doesn’t require me to understand or use those protocols. </p>
<p>
It does, however, require me to understand and use the <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/client/intro/">Mastodon API</a>. Mostly I use that API by way of the <a href="https://github.com/mattn/go-mastodon">Go SDK for Mastodon</a> (thanks, mattn!), sometimes I make REST calls directly. Either way, my read-only dashboards use a fairly small subset of the Mastodon API. The full API is quite broad and deep; it enables API clients to read from and write to Mastodon servers in all sorts of ways. Here are the chapters of the Mastodon API book: <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/apps/">apps</a>, <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/accounts/">accounts</a>, <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/admin/">admin</a>, <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/instance/">instance</a>, <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/search/">search</a>, <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/statuses/">statuses</a>, <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/timelines/">timelines</a>, <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/notifications/">notifications</a>, <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/oembed/">oembed</a>. These chapters define what’s common to all Mastodon clients, including web apps, phone apps, native OS apps, and Steampipe dashboards.</p>
<p>
So far I’ve ignored protocol-enabled interop in order to focus on API-enabled interop. I’m aware that the Fediverse includes much more than just Mastodon. I intend to explore BookWrym, Friendica, Funkwhale, Lemmy, takahe, PeerTube, Pixelfed, PeerTube, and others in due time. But right now the Mastodon ecosystem is plenty to try to wrap my head around.</p>
<p>
For example, there’s a new web client for Mastodon: <a href="https://elk.zone">elk.zone</a>. With the recent addition of support for lists, it has become my favorite way to interact in Mastodon space. So naturally I wanted to be able to click through from Steampipe dashboards to Elk, and use it as an alternative to the batteries-included Mastodon web app.</p>
<p>
It turned out to be easy to enable that integration. Not thanks to ActivityPub, and not even thanks to the API. It works thanks to a third level of interop at play: common patterns for account URLs and toot URLs. </p>
<p>
Here’s the account URL for Ward Cunningham who hangs his shingle at mastodon.radio: <a href="https://mastodon.radio/@k9ox">https://mastodon.radio/@k9ox</a>. But as we saw in <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2022/12/31/instance-qualified-mastodon-urls/">instance-qualified Mastodon URLs</a>, if you visit that URL directly — and if it’s not your home server — you can’t follow Ward there, or add him to a list. You’ll need to copy that URL, paste it into your home server’s search box, run the search, and arrive at an instance-qualified URL where you can follow him or add him to a list: <a href="https://mastodon.social/@k9ox@mastodon.radio">https://mastodon.social/@k9ox@mastodon.radio</a>. If you’re home is fosstodon.org this would instead be <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@k9ox@mastodon.radio">https://fosstodon.org/@k9ox@mastodon.radio</a>.</p>
<p>
Similarly here is one of Ward’s toots at mastodon.radio: <a href="https://mastodon.radio/@k9ox/109802968820955379">https://mastodon.radio/@k9ox/109802968820955379</a>. If you want to reply or boost or favorite, you can’t do it there. The URL you need is again one that routes through your home server: <a href="https://mastodon.social/@k9ox@mastodon.radio/109802969999396562">https://mastodon.social/@k9ox@mastodon.radio/109802969999396562</a>. Note that the ids for the same toot differ! That difference surprised me and some others, and is a topic for another episode. Here I’ll just note that these two patterns govern how we interact when crossing server boundaries in Mastodon space using the stock web client.</p>
<p>
When I started using Elk, another layer of pattern emerged. Here are those same URLs in Elk:</p>
<p>
<a href="https://elk.zone/mastodon.social/@k9ox@mastodon.radio">https://elk.zone/mastodon.social/@k9ox@mastodon.radio</a></p>
<p>
<a href="https://elk.zone/mastodon.social/@k9ox@mastodon.radio/109802969999396562">https://elk.zone/mastodon.social/@k9ox@mastodon.radio/109802969999396562</a></p>
<p>
As it turns out, I just needed to make two of the Steampipe plugin’s transform functions prepend elk.zone to the instance-qualified URLs, then make such prefixing a configuration option. Now when I visit Mastodon links from dashboards, to reply or boost or follow or enlist, I land in the Elk experience that I prefer.</p>
<p>
ActivityPub and WebFinger are formal standards. I would describe the Mastodon API as a de-facto standard. But this prefixing maneuver is just a convention. It’s not guaranteed to work with another web client, and not even guaranteed to work across all URLs presented by the stock Mastodon client. That’s OK by me. Conventions are incredibly useful. The Twitter hashtag is just a convention, after all, inspired in turn by an <a href="https://factoryjoe.com/2007/08/25/groups-for-twitter-or-a-proposal-for-twitter-tag-channels/">IRC convention</a>. </p>
<p>
We’re in one of those Internet moments of rapid innovation, when new conventions can unlock emergent behaviors. It hadn’t even occurred to me that the Steampipe dashboards could support Elk. A few hours after I thought they might, they did. I’ve seen this kind of thing before, perhaps most notably when the blogosophere adopted &lt;link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" href="{feedUrl}"&gt; to enable browsers to auto-discover RSS feeds. That happened about 20 years ago, and quite suddenly when a handful of leading blogging tools adopted the convention in a matter of days. It was a lot of fun to live through that era. If you missed it, enjoy the sequel that’s unfolding now!</p>

<p>The digital wallet is the killer app for the completely open source hardware and software “digital mobile safe” program led by mudge (aka Peiter) Zatko, at Google’s Advanced Technologies and Projects (ATAP) Group back in 2015. We need it today!</p>



<p>Digital wallets are core to enabling individual agency and control over sensitive data in online and offline interactions. In many ways, the European Union is leading this charge with the <a title="Orchestrating an ecosystem">massive identity ecosystem orchestration they are currently in the midst of.</a></p>

<p>At the same time, to ensure that wallets truly remain under individual control we must pay attention to <a title="Whose wallet is it anyway?">choices being made in its development such that the future does not become a collection of proprietary vertical cylinders of excellence (silos)</a>, and that <a title="Asymmetric wallet wars">individuals have true choice in how and when they select wallets</a> for their personal use.</p>

<p>However, there is a curious but important missing element in all of these digital wallet conversations; everyone talks about protocols to interact with a wallet and what should or should not be stored in a wallet, but there is little to no discussion about ensuring the openness, consistency and fidelity of the core security, privacy, cryptographic and storage aspects that a wallet actually needs!</p>

 Common need across digital wallets 

<p>Let us fast forward in time to understand what is needed:</p>

 
   
    <p>I am an EU Citizen with a EU Digital Identity (EUDI) Wallet who is seeking to live and work in the US. I need to interact with the US Government to provide information about who I am, and at the end of that process receive some manner of immigration or work permit related credential. Since I already have an EUDI Wallet, I would like provide information to the USG from that wallet and in turn continue to use that wallet to store any immigration credential I get from the USG.</p>
   
   
    <p>I am a Canadian who is looking to live and work in the EU and when seeking employment there would like to use the digital wallet from my Province that stores my identity information as well as education credentials. My potential employer supports, per EU regulation, the ability to consume these credentials in a digital form.</p>
   
   
    <p>Following upon both of the above scenarios, I would like to open a bank account using my digital wallet to present the needed information for KYC.</p>
   
 

<p>There are so many more variations of this that span the public and private sector, as well as a variety and combinations of credentials.</p>

<p>The commonality across ALL of them is not the credentials, or the protocols, but the underlying foundation and “trustability” of the digital wallet itself by a counter-party. Everything else is pipes and payloads.</p>

<p>And that, to my mind, is what the Google ATAP Project Vault showed could be done in a completely open manner, such that you can actually have independently verifiable confidence in that wallet when it shows up at your digital front door.</p>

 Google ATAP Project Vault 

<p>I would highly recommend folks watching the video below, which includes both a great introduction by Regina Dugan (formerly the first female director of DARPA) as well as the overview and demo of the capability by mudge.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So the question is, why build this [...]</p>
<p>It turns out, you already have security elements in your phones and your computers. SIM Cards; they protect the things that are important to the carriers. Trusted platform modules, or TPMs;  they protect the things that are important to the OEMs and the content providers. [...]</p>
<p>So, where is the security element that protects the things that are important to you, that you have complete control over? So we made one!</p>
<p>[...] So what do developers have to do to get the phones or laptops or IOT devices ready to use Project Vault? Nothing! The host system thinks this is a regular storage device.</p>
mudge
</blockquote>

 
  
 

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/mpbWQbkl8_g?t=2845">Link to Project Vault YouTube video</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As <a title="Parenting the future of technology">I wrote back in 2015:</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Project Vault is a micro-SD form-factor card that, when plugged into a device, makes available to the device a suite of cryptographic tools to enable hashing, signing, bulk encryption, streaming encryption as well as a strong hardware random number generator.</p>

  <p>The algorithms in the vault are not exposed to the host system so you can plug it into an untrusted device while being confident that the host system will not be able to corrupt the vault’s crypto services.</p>

  <p>It also comes with 4GB of isolated, sealed storage which can be used for enabling capabilities such as an immutable logging system where evidence of malicious activity cannot be covered up by tampering with the logs.</p>

  <p>It is operating system agnostic, so will work with a variety of both mobile and desktop operating systems. To the OS it behaves like a proc file system without any kernel drivers, which means that developers don’t have to do anything special in order to utilize it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The one change I would hope for in any current day implementation “… is a Security Key form-factor with USB-C …” because <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/society/20220413STO27211/usb-type-c-to-become-eu-s-common-charger-by-end-of-2024" title="USB-type C to become EU's common charger by end of 2024">USB-type C is mandated to become EU’s standard by the end of 2024</a>, and where the EU is leading with that, the world will follow.</p>

 Opportunity for personal, truly open digital wallets 

<p>There is a clear opportunity here to implement an open source hardware(!) and software foundation (the vault) to enable secure and interoperable wallets that can be used for a variety of purposes, that truly remains under the control of an individual.</p>

<p>However, for anyone going down this path, what will become critical to their success is what they choose not to do rather than what they actually do.</p>

<p>In order to provide a truly open foundation for a digital wallet that is under the personal control of an individual, it will require them to:</p>

 
   keep the focus on enhancing and making production ready the foundational vault capabilities to support hardened, accelerated cryptographic operations and secure storage that are needed for any type of digital wallet 
   build well documented APIs to interact with the core vault services that are open, royalty free and free to implement for anyone 
   think through how best to put into place an independent assessment/verification mechanism with a high degree of transparency and credibility that allows counter-parties to assess the “goodness” of an implementation 
 

<p>I anticipate that the hardest challenges here will not be technical, but instead will be to:</p>

 
   resist the pressure from handset and platform vendors who will seek to influence the work in a manner such that the capabilities being externalized into the vault continue to be gatekeeper’d by them 
   resist the use of platform or vendor specific hardware security elements instead of the open source externalized hardware security elements demonstrated by Project Vault 
   resist getting dragged into the political infighting around directly implementing the variety of credential types or credential issuance and presentation protocols directly in the vault; it should be the responsibility of those specific communities to define and standardize how their protocols can utilize the open platform and vendor neutral vault APIs. 
 

 Building on an open source foundation 

<p>I have no visibility into or awareness of what happened with Project Vault after mudge moved on from Google ATAP. What I do believe is that he, particularly given his prior stint at DARPA, looked around the corner for what was coming, drove the work that was needed to be ready for that future, and made sure it was as widely available as possible by making it entirely open source!</p>

<p>That is a gift that should not be wasted!</p>

 

 <a></a>newRecently: Commons are not tragic 

<p><a href="https://aeon.co/essays/the-tragedy-of-the-commons-is-a-false-and-dangerous-myth" title="The miracle of the commons">Elinor Ostrom, the first woman to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences, debunks the “Tragedy of the Commons”</a> which posits that “Humans, when left to their own devices, compete with one another for resources until the resources run out.”</p>

<p>Her research revealed that “Far from being profoundly destructive, we humans have deep capacities for sharing resources with generosity and foresight.”</p>

<p>The features of successful systems, Ostrom and her colleagues found, include:</p>

 
   
    <p>clear boundaries (the ‘community’ doing the managing must be well-defined);</p>
   
   
    <p>reliable monitoring of the shared resource;</p>
   
   
    <p>a reasonable balance of costs and benefits for participants;</p>
   
   
    <p>a predictable process for the fast and fair resolution of conflicts;</p>
   
   
    <p>an escalating series of punishments for cheaters;</p>
   
   
    <p>and good relationships between the community and other layers of authority, from household heads to international institutions.</p>
   
 

<p>This has implications for and provides hope to those who are building and investing in the “Internet Commons”.</p>

<p>
I began this journey convinced that Steampipe could help the Fediverse evolve, but not sure exactly how. My first thought was to use Steampipe’s <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3648648/how-sql-can-unify-access-to-apis.html">API-wrangling superpower</a> to study patterns of communication (and conflict) across the Fediverse. But as one of many Twitter escapees last November, I soon realized that the network I was joining reflected a culture that had been humming along nicely for six years and didn’t particularly want to be the object of sociological study.</p>
<p>
As I argued in <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2022/11/28/autonomy-packet-size-friction-fanout-and-velocity/">Autonomy, packet size, friction, fanout, and velocity</a>, Mastodon bakes in certain kinds of friction for reasons. You’ve likely heard about a default unfriendliness to search, which is both a technical setting and a cultural choice that privileges the experience of current flow over the mining of past flow. Even more fundamentally, the ID of a toot not only differs from server to server but also obfuscates the toot’s date, another technical/cultural choice that means you can’t randomly access history by date. None of these frictions is insurmountable. They will be overcome for purposes good and bad. I hope and expect that communities will be able to choose their desired amounts and kinds of friction while still interoperating with others. But for my project it seemed that trying to survey the wider Fediverse wasn’t the right place to start.</p>
<p>
So instead I began to explore a different way to read my home timeline. The dashboards that I’ve built and described in this series have become, for me at least, an effective way to scan recent Mastodon flow, then click into the stock client to post, reply, or boost. After overcoming a few obstacles, things are starting to feel like the <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2022/12/17/a-bloomberg-terminal-for-mastodon/">Bloomberg terminal for Mastodon</a> that I envision.</p>
<p>
One of those obstacles was the awkward copy/paste/search of foreign toot URLs that was required in order to interact with them. That’s now overcome by <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2022/12/31/instance-qualified-mastodon-urls/">Instance-qualified Mastodon URLs</a>. Another obstacle was the difficulty of curating and effectively reading topical lists of people. The strategies described in <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2022/12/22/lists-and-people-on-mastodon/">Lists and people on Mastodon</a> and <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2023/01/21/working-with-mastodon-lists/">Working with Mastodon lists</a> have improved matters nicely. And <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2023/01/16/mastodon-relationship-graphs/">relationship graphs</a> turned out to be a more useful alternate view of the current flow than I had expected.</p>
<p>
I think I’ve proven that a set of Steampipe dashboards, layered on a <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-mastodon">plugin</a> that maps the Mastodon API to tables that the dashboards query, can improve the ability to absorb and react to Mastodon flow. An unproven corollary: Steampipe’s <a href="https://steampipe.io/blog/dashboards-as-code">dashboards-as-code</a> system is only one of potentially <a href="https://steampipe.io/docs/cloud/integrations/overview">many clients</a> of the Mastodon plugin. Any dashboarding system or web app or native app could tap into the same query capability to deliver still another way to experience the flow. But that’s a future episode.</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, with a decent reading experience in place, this seemed like a good time to circle back to the question of surveying the wider Fediverse. To begin enabling that I added a couple of new tables to the plugin: <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-mastodon/blob/main/docs/tables/mastodon_peer.md">mastodon_peer</a> and <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-mastodon/blob/main/docs/tables/mastodon_domain_block.md">mastodon_domain_block</a>.</p>
<p>
Here’s a query that uses mastodon_peer.</p>
 with data as (
  select
    'https://' || server as server
  from
    mastodon_toot
  where
    timeline = 'home'
  limit 100
),
servers as (
  select
    server,
    count(*) as occurrences
  from
    data
  group by
    server
)
select
  s.server,
  s.occurrences,
  count(p.peer) as peers
from
  servers s
join
  mastodon_peer p
on
  s.server = p.server
group by
  s.server,
  s.occurrences
order by
  peers desc
 
<p>
In Engish: gather the most recent 100 toots in my home timeline, count the occurrences of each origin server, then ask each origin server how many other servers it talks to. Unsurprisingly my home server, mastodon.social, occurs most often. And because it’s the marquee Mastodon server it has the most peers. </p>

<p>
Here’s a query that uses mastodon_domain_block.</p>
 with data as (
  select
    'https://' || server as server
  from
    mastodon_toot
  where
    timeline = 'home'
  limit 100
),
servers as (
  select
    server,
    count(*) as occurrences
  from
    data
  group by
    server
)
select
  s.server,
  s.occurrences,
  count(d.domain) as "blocked domains"
from
  servers s
join
  mastodon_domain_block d
on
  s.server = d.server
group by
  s.server,
  s.occurrences
order by
  "blocked domains" desc
 
<p>
This one says: Again gather the origin servers in my recent home timeline, but this time ask each one how many other servers it blocks. Here we see that octodon.social, which happened to show up in my timeline when I ran the query, blocks a lot more servers than mastodon.social does.</p>
 +--------------------------+-------------+-----------------+
| server                   | occurrences | blocked domains |
+--------------------------+-------------+-----------------+
| https://octodon.social   | 1           | 510             |
| https://mastodon.social  | 8           | 181             |
| https://hachyderm.io     | 4           | 125             |
| https://infosec.exchange | 4           | 66              |
| https://nerdculture.de   | 1           | 36              |
| https://indieweb.social  | 4           | 23              |
+--------------------------+-------------+-----------------+
 
<p>
One could, and maybe at some point I will, comprehensively acquire and store this data. But meanwhile, how might it enhance the experience of reading recent Mastodon flow? Here’s what I’ve got so far.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/blocked-servers.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>
We’ve already seen the first table which answers the question: “How many servers does each of the origin servers in my timeline block?” The second table answers a different question: “Which servers are most often blocked by the origin servers in my timeline?” </p>
<p>
The blocking server list column shows an interesting mix of consensus and variation, and I think that will be something to explore comprehensively across the Fediverse. But for now I like how this view contextualizes what’s in my home timeline. Like the relationship graphs, it’s highly dynamic because my immediate network neighborhood is changing all the time. Whatever the current set of servers happens to be, though, I now have some clues about how connected each of those servers is and how aggressively each one is blocking others. This feels like a good first step toward mapping the wider Fediverse.</p>

<p>2022 marked the end of a big chapter of my life. The culmination of my PhD journey, easily the most challenging project I have ever undertaken. Alongside graduating from my PhD as a Doctor of Philosophy, this year I formalised my relationship as a Consultant Requirements Engineer at Legendary Requirements, helped to produce RWOT the Hague and participated in a research sprint focused on <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/projects/digital-identity-times-crisis">Digital Identity in Times of Crisis</a> coordinated by the Berkman Klein Center where I wrote a soon to be published short hopepunk story titled Experiences in Memory Space. </p>
<p>This post is a brief reflection on and celebration of this last year and the PhD adventure that brought me to this moment. It will likely be the last post I submit to this site, as I experiment with new self-presentations of myself online. </p>
<p>First, I have to say what an honour, joy and privilege it was to participate as one of the first PhD students at the Blockpass Identity Lab at Edinburgh Napier University. I didn’t fully comprehend what I was getting myself into back in <a href="https://wip-abramson.dev/bil-launch">2018</a>, but it exceeded my expectations. </p>
<p>That I had the freedom and support to explore the boundaries and the depths of human knowledge is something I will be forever grateful for. To perceive the interconnections and evolution of human scientific thought stretching back into our past, back to the seeds of ideas and the subsequent foundations upon which our modern information society has been built. It has been both an awe-inspiring and humbling experience. I am grateful to all those who influenced, shaped and supported me along the way, especially my PhD supervisor and mentor Professor Bill Buchanan.</p>
<p>It is telling that the last post I made to this site was almost two years ago in March 2021. Since then, almost all of my writing energy was turned towards producing my thesis. In the process I wrote over 200,000 words on <a href="https://new.750words.com/">750words.com</a>, a lifesaving practice where I worked through my goals, fears, doubts and initial drafts. Then there were the countless words produced iterating through drafts, revisions and rewrites as I attempted to corral my thoughts and sythesise my learnings into a coherent, consistent body of text. The end result being an 80,000 word tome titled Identity and Identification in an Information Society: Augmenting Formal Systems of Identification with Technological Artefacts that I imagine few will ever read. Regardless, it is a piece of work I will always be proud of.</p>
<p>My thesis presents my unique perspective on the identification systems, shaped by my academic research across multiple disciplinary boundaries and my practical experience as an implementer and participant in the rapidly evolving decentralized identity space. I believe there are some nuggets within its pages. My personal highlights include:</p>
 
 The chapter titled Security without Identification which traces the history and evolution scientific thought on cryptography through the lens of cryptographic credentials first conceptualised by David Chaum’s seminal paper <a href="https://www.cs.ru.nl/~jhh/pub/secsem/chaum1985bigbrother.pdf">Security without Identification</a>. 
 My determination to include a broader, sociological understanding of identification systems, despite advice that it should be left out of scope. See Chapters Identity, Trust and Privacy in an Information Society and Identification Systems. 
 The workshop I ran at the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.14864.pdf">Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh</a> that introduced verifiable credentials and explored issues and perceptions around their use for clinical passporting solutions. 
 The subtle influences of Ludwick Fleck’s work: <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/G/bo25676016.html">The Genesis and Development of a Scientific Fact</a> that I attempted to weave throughout my thesis. 
 The diverse, high quality references throughout my thesis, that are testament to the depth and breadth of human knowledge produced on identity and identification throughout the last 100 years. 
 The content in my appendix, especially my wacky abstract diagrams and a paper I wrote but never published that talks about identity and interaction in terms of complex adaptive systems. 
 
<p>Of course there are some aspects I am less pleased with, but I imagine that is always the case. I completed it, passed my viva and graduated which is all that really matters at the end of the day.</p>
<p>I have ambitions to synthesise and adapt parts of my thesis into more digestible content which I will make available on my new professional self-presentation - <a href="https://drwip.com">https://drwip.com</a>. We will see how that goes. In the meantime, if you are interested to give it a read I am happy to send it across.</p>
<p>It is also important to point out that the thesis is not the journey, just like the map is not the territory. There were so many other explorations, side quests, learning opportunities and experiences that shaped my perspective throughout my PhD and are not well reflected in the thesis. Growing into a researcher and developing my academic voice, exploring the beauty of Edinburgh and Scotland, learning Rust, participating in the interdisciplinary <a href="https://francesryanphd.com/2019/12/tapestry-sandpit-register/">TAPESTRY research sandpit</a>, over two years collaborating with the <a href="https://www.openmined.org/">OpenMined </a>community, the <a href="https://wip-abramson.dev/mapping-workshop">Odyssey hackathon</a> where I contributed to the initial POC for the <a href="https://commonsstack.org/">Commons Stack</a>, <a href="https://wip-abramson.dev/rwot8">RWOT Barcelona</a>, <a href="https://wip-abramson.dev/mapping-workshop">MyData</a>, my <a href="https://wip-abramson.dev/codi-virtual">attempt</a> at the Cabaret of Dangerous Ideas as part of the unfortunately virtual Edinburgh Fringe, my evolving thoughts about <a href="https://wip-abramson.dev/ideas-memory">memory and meaning</a> and countless other experiences. With at least half of my studies against the backdrop of the pandemic, adding its own layer of challenges into the mix and changes to adapt to.</p>
<p>My PhD journey was daunting, exhilarating, stressful, inspiring, exhausting, humbling and joyful at different moments along the way. A rollercoaster of emotions, motivation, exhaustion and determination. I am glad it is over, but I will be forever grateful for the opportunities and experiences that it opened up for me. </p>
 Looking to the Future 
<p>The future is unknown and unknowable. However, despite this I have repeatedly seen the value of setting expectations of it. Imagining, outlining and articulating possible futures that I would like to see come to pass. In fact I am playing around with a whole new space - <a href="https://futurewip.com">https://futurewip.com</a> - to playfully explore and experiment with just this in the context of the climate emergency. Even if it is more of a placeholder at the moment. I enjoy learning a new voice and style with which to write in. Crafting new identities you might say. Which if I have learnt anything over my PhD, it is that the identities we hold, take or have applied to us shape our experienced present and inturn influence our future. I believe there a few things more powerful that intentionally constructing loosely held identities for yourself as a means to explore yourself and who you might want to be in the future. </p>
<p>Another thing I learnt during my thesis, is that I love the freedom to self-direct my attention and time whilst exploring things that I care deeply about. Which identity and identification in an information society is certainly one, as I have come to view it as critical to the future of humanity and the forms and structures it might take. Whatever I end up doing in the future, I want to make sure I have time to spend as I choose because I am confident in my ability to spend it well and know this helps me thrive. At the moment that looks like pursuing a research and development agenda focused on <a href="https://wip-abramson.dev/ideas-memory">memory and meaning</a> as previously discussed on this blog. Indeed the questions I posed on my home page two years ago appear rather prescient and increasingly relevant in the context of LLMs such as ChatGPT. The speculative fiction story I produced as part of the BKC research sprint further explores these ideas through a different creative lens. I have some other interesting ideas and experiments around this concept that I hope to share over the coming months.</p>
<p>Professionally, I see my future intertwined with Legendary Requirements. Through Legendary I have been exposed to a diverse and interesting set of clients, projects and technologies with challenging problems that are fun to work through. It is clear that we add value to our clients, that I add value to Legendary and that Legendary values my contributions. My work is flexible, engaging and self-directed. The people I work with are intelligent, kind and thoughtful. I feel fortunate to have had such a smooth transition from my PhD into a job that respects my time, supports my growth and encourages my independence.</p>
<p> The decentralized identity space is still young and emerging. Legendary Requirements is well positioned to continue to work at the forefront of this space, helping clients discover, document and maintain human requirements for real world systems and use cases. </p>
<p>I am excited to see what the future holds.</p>

  A quick tip for speeding up Perl builds in GitHub workflows by caching dependencies.

<p>I’ve spent quite a few hours evenings and weekends recently building out a
comprehensive suite of <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/sqitch/actions">GitHub Actions for Sqitch</a>. They cover a dozen versions
of Perl, nearly 70 database versions amongst nine database engines, plus a
coverage test and a release workflow. A pull request can expect over 100 actions
to run. Each build requires over 100 direct dependencies, plus all their
dependencies. Installing them for every build would make any given run
untenable.</p>
<p>Happily, GitHub Actions include a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/advanced-guides/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows" title="GitHub Actions: “Caching dependencies to speed up workflows”">caching feature</a>, and thanks to a
<a href="https://github.com/shogo82148/actions-setup-perl/pull/892">recent improvement to shogo82148/actions-setup-perl</a>,
it’s quite easy to use in a version-independent way. Here’s an example:</p>
  <code>name: Test
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  OS:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ ubuntu, macos, windows ]
        perl: [ 'latest', '5.34', '5.32', '5.30', '5.28' ]
    name: Perl ${{ matrix.perl }} on ${{ matrix.os }}
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Source
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Perl
        id: perl
        uses: shogo82148/actions-setup-perl@v1
        with: { perl-version: "${{ matrix.perl }}" }
      - name: Cache CPAN Modules
        uses: actions/cache@v3
        with:
          path: local
          key: perl-${{ steps.perl.outputs.perl-hash }}
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: cpm install --verbose --show-build-log-on-failure --no-test --cpanfile cpanfile
      - name: Run Tests
        env: { PERL5LIB: "${{ github.workspace }}/local/lib/perl5" }
        run: prove -lrj4
</code>  <p>This workflow tests every permutation of OS and Perl version specified in
<code>jobs.OS.strategy.matrix</code>, resulting in 15 jobs. The <code>runs-on</code> value determines
the OS, while the <code>steps</code> section defines steps for each permutation. Let’s take
each step in turn:</p>
 
 “Checkout Source” checks the project out of GitHub. Pretty much required for
any project. 
 “Setup Perl” sets up the version of Perl using the value from the matrix.
Note the <code>id</code> key set to <code>perl</code>, used in the next step. 
 “Cache CPAN Modules” uses the <a href="https://github.com/actions/cache">cache action</a> to cache the directory named
<code>local</code> with the key <code>perl-${{ steps.perl.outputs.perl-hash }}</code>. The key
lets us keep different versions of the <code>local</code> directory based on a unique
key. Here we’ve used the <code>perl-hash</code> output from the <code>perl</code> step defined
above. The <code>actions-setup-perl</code> action outputs this value, which contains a
hash of the output of <code>perl -V</code>, so we’re tying the cache to a very specific
version and build of Perl. This is important since compiled modules are not
compatible across major versions of Perl. 
 “Install Dependencies” uses <a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/App-cpm/view/script/cpm" title="cpm - a fast CPAN module installer"><code>cpm</code></a> to quickly install Perl dependencies. By
default, it puts them into the <code>local</code> subdirectory of the current directory
— just where we configured the cache. On the first run for a given OS and
Perl version, it will install all the dependencies. But on subsequent runs
it will find the dependencies already present, thank to the cache, and
quickly exit, reporting “All requirements are satisfied.” In <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/sqitch/runs/4275487924?check_suite_focus=true">this Sqitch
job</a>, it takes less than a second. 
 “Run Tests” runs the tests that require the dependencies. It requires the
<code>PERL5LIB</code> environment variable to point to the location of our cached
dependencies. 
 
<p>That’s the whole deal. The first run will be the slowest, depending on the
number of dependencies, but subsequent runs will be much faster, up to the
seven-day caching period. For a complex project like Sqitch, which uses the same
OS and Perl version for most of its actions, this results in a tremendous build
time savings. CI configurations we’ve used in the past often took an hour or
more to run. Today, most builds take only a few minutes to test, with longer
times determined not by dependency installation but by container and database
latency.</p>

  We're tackling a field that touches every domain, has a deep history, and is currently growing faster than anyone can keep up with.

<p>I’d been chatting with <a href="https://identitywoman.net/">Kaliya Identity Woman</a> for around a year, after contacting her about the potential for our collaborating on decentralized identity. At some point, she proposed the idea of writing a newsletter together, under the <a href="https://identosphere.net">Identosphere.net</a> domain.</p>

<p>Before embarking upon this project, we spent a lot of time figuring out how to run a newsletter: sustainably, affordably and with as few third party services as possible, while I learn the use of various web-tools.</p>

<p>We’re tackling a field that touches every domain, has a deep history, and is currently growing faster than anyone can keep up with. But this problem of fast-moving information streams isn’t unique to digital identity, and what we learn here could be of use in any conceivable domain.</p>

 GitHub Pages 

<p>I started in Decentralized ID creating freelance content, and ended up building an Awesome List, to organize my findings. Once that list outgrew the Awesome format, I began learning to create static web-sites with <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> and <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>.</p>

<p>I saved some useful guides along that path in my <a href="https://web-work.tools/jamstack/github-pages-starter-pack/">GitHub Pages Starter Pack</a></p>

<p>Static Websites are great for security and require minimal infrastructure, but if you’re trying to create any type of business online, you’re gonna want some forms so you can begin collecting e-mail subscribers! Forms are not supported natively through Jekyll or GitHub Pages.</p>

 Enter Staticman 

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: I’m not currently using these forms, because I didn’t have the energy to maintain, verses the use they were getting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://github.com/eduardoboucas/staticman">Staticman</a> is a comments engine for static websites, but can be used for any kind of form, with the proper precautions.</p>

<p>It can be deployed to Heroku with a click of a button, made into a GitHub App, or run on your own server. Once set up, it will submit a pull-request to your repository with the form details (and an optional <a href="https://www.mailgun.com/">mailgun</a> integration).</p>

<p>I set it up on my own server and created a <a href="https://travisdowns.github.io/blog/2020/02/05/now-with-comments.html">bot account on GitHub</a> with permissions to a private repository for the Staticman app to update with subscriptions e-mails to.</p>

<p>Made the form, and a <code>staticman.yml</code> config file in the root of the private repository where I’m collecting e-mail addresses.</p>

 The Subscription Form

 Planet Pluto Feed Reader 

<blockquote>
  <p>In online media a planet is a feed aggregator application designed to collect posts from the weblogs of members of an internet community and display them on a single page. - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_(software)">Planet (Software)</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the most promising projects I found, in pursuit of keeping up with all the info, is <a href="https://github.com/web-work-tools/awesome-planet-pluto">Planet Pluto Feed Reader</a>, by Gerald Bauer.</p>

<p>For the uninitiated, I should mention that websites typically generate a machine readable copy of your blog in what’s called an RSS feed.</p>

<p>This allows anyone to follow your content in a newsreader, allowing users to keep up with posts from multiple locations without needing to visit each site individually.</p>

<p>Pluto Feed reader works just like a podcast app, but builds a simple webpage from the feeds added to it (or can be integrated with a Jekyll template).</p>

<p><a href="http://planet-templates.github.io/"></a></p>

<p>Pluto is built with <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>, using the <a href="https://www.stuartellis.name/articles/erb/">ERB templating</a> language for <a href="https://github.com/planet-templates">web-page design</a>.</p>

<p>One of the cool things about ERB is it lets you use any ruby function in your web-page template, supporting any capability you might want to enable while rendering your news feed. This project has greatly helped me to learn the basics of Ruby while customizing its templates to suit my needs.</p>

 Feed Search 

<p>I use the <a href="https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub-Radar">RSSHub Radar</a> browser extension to find feeds for sites while I’m browsing. However, this would be a lot of work when I want to get feeds for a number of sites at once.</p>

<p>I found a few simple python apps that find feeds for me. They aren’t perfect, but they do allow me to find feeds for multiple sites at the same time, all I have to do is format the query and hit enter.</p>

<p>As you can see below, these are not fully formed applications, just a few lines of code. To run them, it’s necessary to install <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python</a>, install the package with <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pip/">pip</a> (<code>pip install feedsearch-crawler</code>), and type <code>python</code> at the command prompt, which takes you to a Python terminal that will recognize these commands.</p>

<p>From there you can type\paste python commands for demonstration, practice, or for simple scripts like this. I could also put the following scripts into their own feedsearch.py file and type <code>python feedsearch.py</code>,  but I haven’t gotten around to doing anything like that.</p>

<p>Depending on the site, and the features you’re interested in, either of these feed seekers has their merits.</p>

 Feedsearch Crawler 

 
   <a href="https://github.com/DBeath/feedsearch-crawler">DBeath/feedsearch-crawler</a> 
 

   <code>from feedsearch_crawler import search
import logging
logging.basicConfig(filename='example.log',level=logging.DEBUG)
import output_opml
list = ["http://bigfintechmedia.com/Blog/","http://blockchainespana.com/","http://blog.deanland.com/"]
for items in list:
    feeds = search(items)
    output_opml(feeds).decode()
    logger = logging.getLogger("feedsearch_crawler")
</code>   

 Feed seeker 

 
   <a href="https://github.com/mitmedialab/feed_seeker">mitmedialab/feed_seeker</a> 
 

   <code>from feed_seeker import generate_feed_urls
list = ["http://bigfintechmedia.com/Blog/","http://blockchainespana.com/","http://blog.deanland.com/"]
for items in list:
    for url in generate_feed_urls(items):
        print(url)
</code>   

 GitHub Actions 

<p>Pluto Feed Reader is great, but I needed to find a way for it to run a regular schedule, so I wouldn’t have to run the command every time I wanted to check for new feeds. For this, I’ve used <a href="https://github.com/actions/setup-python">GitHub actions</a>.</p>

<p>This is an incredible feature of GitHub that allows you to spin up a virtual machine, install an operating system, dependencies supporting your application, and whatever commands you’d like to run, on a schedule.</p>

   <code>name: Build BlogCatcher
on:
  schedule:
    # This action runs 4x a day.
    - cron:  '0/60 */4 * * *'
  push:
    paths:

    - 'planetid.ini'
jobs:
  updatefeeds:

    steps:

 Identosphere Blogcatcher 

<p><a href="https://identosphere.net/"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://identosphere.net/">Identosphere Blogcatcher</a> (<a href="https://github.com/identosphere/planetid-reboot">source</a>) is a feed aggregator for personal blogs of people who’ve been working on digital identity through the years, inspired by the original <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161029051802/http://planetidentity.org/">Planet Identity</a>.</p>

<p>We also have a page for <a href="https://identosphere.net/companies/">companies</a>, and another for <a href="https://identosphere.net/organizations/">organizations</a> working in the field.</p>

 Identosphere Weekly Highlights 

<p>After we got these pages up and running, we were ready to start our newsletter. This is just a small piece of the information portal we’re working towards, and not enough to make this project as painless and comprehensive as possible, but we had enough to get started.</p>

<p>Every week, we get browse the [BlogCatcher]identosphere.net), and share essential content others in our field will appreciate.</p>

<p>We’ll be publishing our 6th edition, at the start of next week, and our numbers are doing well!</p>

<p></p>

<p>This newsletter is free, and a great opportunity for us to work together on something consistent while developing a few other ideas.</p>

 <a href="https://newsletter.identosphere.net/">newsletter.identosphere.net</a> 

<p>Setting up a newsletter without third-party intermediaries is more of a challenge than I’m currently up for, so we’ve settled on Substack for now, which seems to be a trending platform for tech newsletters.</p>

<p>It has a variety of options for both paid and free content, and you can read our content before subscribing.</p>

 <a href="https://www.patreon.com/identosphere">Support us on Patreon</a> 

<p>While keeping the newsletter free, we are accepting contributions via Patreon. (yes another intermediary, but we can draw upon a large existing userbase, and it’s definitely easier than setting up a self-hosted alternative.)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/identosphere"></a></p>

<p>So far, we have enough to cover a bit more than server costs, and this will ideally grow to support our efforts, and enable us to sustainably continue developing these open informational projects.</p>

 Python, Twitter Api, and GitHub Actions 

<p>Since we’re publishing this newsletter, and I’ve gotten a better handle on my inner state, I decided it was time to come back to twitter. However, I knew I couldn’t do it the old way, where I manually re-tweeted everything of interest, spending hours a day scrolling multiple accounts trying to stay abreast of important developments.</p>

<p>Instead, I dove into the twitter api. The benefits of using twitter programmatically can’t be understated. For my first project, I decided to try an auto-poster, which could enable me to keep an active twitter account, without having to regularly pay attention to twitter.</p>

<p>I found a simple guide <a href="https://dototot.com/how-to-write-a-twitter-bot-with-python-and-tweepy/">How To Write a Twitter Bot with Python and tweepy</a> composed of a dozen lines of python. That simple script posts a tweet to your account, but I wanted to post from a pre-made list, and so figured out how to read from a <a href="https://yaml.org/">yaml</a> file, and then used <a href="https://github.com/actions/setup-python">GitHub actions</a> to run the script on a regular schedule.</p>

<p>While that didn’t result in anything I’m ready to share here, quite yet, somewhere during that process I realized that I could write python. After playing around with Ruby, in ERB, to build the BlogCatcher, and running various python scripts that other people wrote, tinkering where necessary, eventually I had pieced together enough knowledge I could actually write my own code!</p>

 Decentralized ID Weekly Twitter Collections 

<p>With that experience as a foundation I knew I was ready to come <a href="https://twitter.com/DecentralizeID/">back to Twitter</a>, begin trying to make more efficient use of its wealth of knowledge, and see about keeping up my accounts without losing too much hair.</p>

<p>I made <a href="https://gist.github.com/vickyqian/f70e9ab3910c7c290d9d715491cde44c">a script that searches twitter</a> for a variety of keywords related to decentralized identity, and write the tweet text and some other attributes to a csv file. From there, I can sort through those tweets, and save only the most relevant, and publish a few hundred tweets about decentralized identity to a weekly <a href="https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/creating-a-twitter-collection-via-api-1378ecfe20df">twitter collection</a>, that make our job a lot easier than going to 100’s of websites to find out what’s happening. :D</p>

<p>Soon, these will be regularly published to <a href="https://decentralized-id.com">decentralized-id.com</a>, which I found out is an approved method of re-publishing tweets, unlike the ad hoc method I was using before, sharing them to discord channels (which grabs metadata and displays the preview image \ text), exporting their contents and re-publishing that.</p>

<p>I do intend to share my source for all that after I’ve gotten the kinks worked out, and set it running on an action.</p>

 Twitter collections I’ve made so far 

 
   <a href="https://twitter.com/DecentralizeID/timelines/1322735918386733057">Self Sovereign ID 101</a> 
   <a href="https://twitter.com/DecentralizeID/timelines/1322785746915307520">October Week 5 #SSI #DID</a> 
   <a href="https://twitter.com/DecentralizeID/timelines/1325219075463712769">November Week 1 #SSI #DID</a> 
 

 Decentralized-ID.com 

<p>Now we have a newsletter, and are seeking patrons, it seemed appropriate to work on developing <a href="https://decentralized-id.com/posts/">decentralized-id.com</a>, cleaning up some of its hastily thrown together parts, and adding a bunch of content to better represent the decentralized identity space.</p>

<p>That said, I’ve not given up on <a href="https://bitcoinfo.xyz">Bitcoin</a>, or <a href="https://sourcecrypto.pub">Crypto</a>. On the contrary, I’m sure this work is only expanding my future capacity to continue working to fulfil the original vision of those resources.</p>

 Web-Work.Tools 

<p>With the information and skills i’ve gathered over the past year, <a href="https://web-work.tools">web-work.tools</a> was starting to look pretty out of date, relative to the growth of my understanding.</p>

<p>I updated <a href="https://web-work.tools/jamstack/github-pages-starter-pack/">GitHub Pages Starter Pack \ Extended Resources</a> quite a lot to reflect those learnings, and separate the wheat from the chaff of the links I gathered when I was first figuring out how to use GitHub pages.</p>

 Thanks for stopping by!

<p>Back in June, I wrote about <a href="https://justatheory.com/2020/06/test-extensions-with-github-actions/" title="Test Postgres Extensions With GitHub Actions">testing Postgres extensions</a> on
multiple versions of Postgres using <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a>. The pattern relies on
Docker image, <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pgxn/pgxn-tools">pgxn/pgxn-tools</a>, which contains scripts to build and run any
version of PostgreSQL, install additional dependencies, build, test, bundle, and
release an extension. I’ve since updated it to support testing on the the latest
development release of Postgres, meaning one can test on any major version from
8.4 to (currently) 14. I’ve also created GitHub workflows for all of my PGXN
extensions (except for <a href="https://pgtap.org">pgTAP</a>, which is complicated). I’m quite happy with it.</p>
<p>But I was never quite satisfied with the release process. Quite a number of
Postgres extensions also release on GitHub; indeed, <a href="http://blog.cleverelephant.ca">Paul Ramsey</a> told me
straight up that he did not want to manually upload extensions like <a href="https://github.com/pramsey/pgsql-http">pgsql-http</a>
and <a href="http://postgis.net">PostGIS</a> to PGXN, but for PGXN to automatically pull them in when they were
published on GitHub. It’s pretty cool that newer packaging systems like
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev">pkg.go.dev</a> auto-index any packages on GibHub. Adding such a feature to PGXN
would be an interesting exercise.</p>
<p>But since I’m low on TUITs for such a significant undertaking, I decided instead
to work out how to automatically publish a release on GitHub and PGXN via
<a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a>. After experimenting for a few months, I’ve worked out a
straightforward method that should meet the needs of most projects. I’ve proven
the pattern via the <a href="https://github.com/theory/kv-pair/">pair extension</a>’s <a href="https://github.com/theory/kv-pair/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml"><code>release.yml</code></a>, which successfully
published the v0.1.7 release today on both <a href="https://github.com/theory/kv-pair/releases/tag/v0.1.7">GitHub</a> and
<a href="https://pgxn.org/dist/pair/0.1.7/">PGXN</a>. With that success, I updated the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pgxn/pgxn-tools">pgxn/pgxn-tools</a>
documentation with a starter example. It looks like this:</p>

 <code>name: Release

      - 'v*' # Push events matching v1.0, v20.15.10, etc.

    name: Release on GitHub and PGXN
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container: pgxn/pgxn-tools
    env:
      # Required to create GitHub release and upload the bundle.
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    steps:
    - name: Check out the repo
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Bundle the Release
      id: bundle
      run: pgxn-bundle
    - name: Release on PGXN
      env:
        # Required to release on PGXN.
        PGXN_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.PGXN_USERNAME }}
        PGXN_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.PGXN_PASSWORD }}
      run: pgxn-release
    - name: Create GitHub Release
      id: release
      uses: actions/create-release@v1
      with:
        tag_name: ${{ github.ref }}
        release_name: Release ${{ github.ref }}
        body: |
          Changes in this Release
          - First Change
          - Second Change          
    - name: Upload Release Asset
      uses: actions/upload-release-asset@v1
      with:
        # Reference the upload URL and bundle name from previous steps.
        upload_url: ${{ steps.release.outputs.upload_url }}
        asset_path: ./${{ steps.bundle.outputs.bundle }}
        asset_name: ${{ steps.bundle.outputs.bundle }}
        asset_content_type: application/zip
</code> 
 
 <p>Here’s how it works:</p>
 
 
<p>Lines 4-5 trigger the workflow only when a tag starting with the letter v is
pushed to the repository. This follows the common convention of tagging
releases with version numbers, such as <code>v0.1.7</code> or <code>v4.6.0-dev</code>. This
assumes that the tag represents the commit for the release.</p>
 
 
<p>Line 10 specifies that the job run in the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pgxn/pgxn-tools">pgxn/pgxn-tools</a> container, where
we have our tools for building and releasing extensions.</p>
 
 
<p>Line 13 passes the <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> variable into the container. This is the
GitHub <a href="https://github.com/settings/tokens/new">personal access token</a> that’s automatically set for every build. It
lets us call the <a href="https://docs.github.com/">GitHub API</a> via actions later in the workflow.</p>
 
 
<p>Step “Bundle the Release”, on Lines 17-19, validates the extension
<code>META.json</code> file and creates the release zip file. It does so by simply
reading the distribution name and version from the <code>META.json</code> file and
archiving the Git repo into a zip file. If your process for creating a
release file is more complicated, you can do it yourself here; just be sure
to include an <code>id</code> for the step, and emit a line of text so that later
actions know what file to release. The output should be appended to the
<code>$GITHUB_OUTPUT</code> file like this, with <code>$filename</code> representing the name of
the release file, usually <code>$extension-$version.zip</code>:</p>
 <code>echo bundle=$filename &gt;&gt; $GITHUB_OUTPUT
</code>  
 
<p>Step “Release on PGXN”, on lines 20-25, releases the extension on PGXN. We
take this step first because it’s the strictest, and therefore the most
likely to fail. If it fails, we don’t end up with an orphan GitHub release
to clean up once we’ve fixed things for PGXN.</p>
 
 
<p>With the success of a PGXN release, step “Create GitHub Release”, on lines
26-35, uses the GitHub <a href="https://github.com/actions/create-release">create-release</a> action to create a release
corresponding to the tag. Note the inclusion of <code>id: release</code>, which will be
referenced below. You’ll want to customize the body of the release; for the <a href="https://github.com/theory/kv-pair/">pair extension</a>, I added a simple <a href="https://github.com/theory/kv-pair/blob/798cd00e76b5b029967262101b9bb2c4add0e9d2/Makefile#L28-L29">make target</a> to generate a file, then pass it
via the <code>body_path</code> config:</p>
  <code>- name: Generate Release Changes
  run: make latest-changes.md
- name: Create GitHub Release
  id: release
  uses: actions/create-release@v1
  with:
    tag_name: ${{ github.ref }}
    release_name: Release ${{ github.ref }}
    body_path: latest-changes.md
</code>   
 
<p>Step “Upload Release Asset”, on lines 36-43, adds the release file to the
GitHub release, using output of the <code>release</code> step to specify the URL to
upload to, and the output of the <code>bundle</code> step to know what file to upload.</p>
 
 
<p>Lotta steps, but works nicely. I only wish I could require that the testing
workflow finish before doing a release, but I generally tag a release once it
has been thoroughly tested in previous commits, so I think it’s acceptable.</p>
<p>Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m off to add this workflow to my other PGXN
extensions.</p>

<p>I first heard about <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a> a couple years ago, but fully embraced them
only in the last few weeks. Part of the challenge has been the paucity of simple
but realistic examples, and quite a lot of complicated-looking JavaScript-based
actions that seem like overkill. But through trial-and-error, I figured out
enough to update my Postgres extensions projects to automatically test on
multiple versions of Postgres, as well as to bundle and release them on <a href="https://pgxn.org/" title="PGXN: The PostgreSQL Extension Network">PGXN</a>.
The first draft of that effort is <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pgxn/pgxn-tools">pgxn/pgxn-tools</a><a>1</a>, a Docker image
with scripts to build and run any version of PostgreSQL between 8.4 and 12,
install additional dependencies, build, test, bundle, and release an extension.</p>
<p>Here’s how I’ve put it to use in a <a href="https://github.com/theory/pg-semver/blob/c56d76dcbe85e0348b44c6c098560a0df7ab25a5/.github/workflows/ci.yml">GitHub workflow for semver</a>, the
<a href="https://semver.org">Semantic Version</a> data type:</p>

 <code>name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        pg: [12, 11, 10, 9.6, 9.5, 9.4, 9.3, 9.2]
    name: 🐘 PostgreSQL ${{ matrix.pg }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container: pgxn/pgxn-tools
    steps:
      - run: pg-start ${{ matrix.pg }}
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: pg-build-test
</code> 
 
 <p>The important bits are in the <code>jobs.test</code> object. Under <code>strategy.matrix</code>, which
defines the build matrix, the <code>pg</code> array defines each version to be tested. The
job will run once for each version, and can be referenced via <code>${{ matrix.pg }}</code>
elsewhere in the job. Line 10 has the job a <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pgxn/pgxn-tools">pgxn/pgxn-tools</a> container, where
the <code>steps</code> run. The are are:</p>
 
 Line 12: Install and start the specified version of PostgreSQL 
 Line 13: Clone the <a href="https://github.com/theory/pg-semver">semver repository</a> 
 Line 14: Build and test the extension 
 
<p>The intent here is to cover the vast majority of cases for testing Postgres
extensions, where a project uses <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/extend-pgxs.html" title="PostgreSQL Extension Building Infrastructure">PGXS</a> <code>Makefile</code>. The <code>pg-build-test</code> script
does just that.</p>
<p>A few notes on the scripts included in <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pgxn/pgxn-tools">pgxn/pgxn-tools</a>:</p>
 
 
<p><code>pg-start</code> installs, initializes, and starts the specified version of Postgres.
If you need other dependencies, simply list their <a href="https://www.debian.org/distrib/packages#search_packages" title="Search Debian Packages">Debian package names</a>
after the Postgres version.</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://github.com/pgxn/pgxnclient"><code>pgxn</code></a> is a client for PGXN itself. You can use it to install other
dependencies required to test your extension.</p>
 
 
<p><code>pg-build-test</code> simply builds, installs, and tests a PostgreSQL extension or
other code in the current directory. Effectively the equivalent of
<code>make &amp;&amp; make install &amp;&amp; make installcheck</code>.</p>
 
 
<p><code>pgxn-bundle</code> validates the <a href="http://manager.pgxn.org/howto" title="PGXN How To">PGXN <code>META.json</code></a> file, reads the distribution
name and version, and bundles up the project into a zip file for release to
PGXN.</p>
 
 
<p><code>pgxn-release</code> uploads a release zip file to <a href="https://pgxn.org/" title="PGXN: The PostgreSQL Extension Network">PGXN</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>In short, use the first three utilities to handle dependencies and test your
extension, and the last two to release it on PGXN. Simply set <a href="https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets">GitHub secrets</a>
with your PGXN credentials, pass them in environment variables named
<code>PGXN_USERNAME</code> and <code>PGXN_PASSWORD</code>, and the script will handle the rest. Here’s
how a release job might look:</p>
  

 <code>15
16

22

</code> 

 <code>  release:
    name: Release on PGXN
    # Release pon push to main when the test job succeeds.
    needs: test
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' &amp;&amp; github.event_name == 'push' &amp;&amp; needs.test.result == 'success'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: pgxn/pgxn-tools
      env:
        PGXN_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.PGXN_USERNAME }}
        PGXN_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.PGXN_PASSWORD }}
    steps:
      - name: Check out the repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Bundle the Release
        run: pgxn-bundle
      - name: Release on PGXN
        run: pgxn-release
</code> 
 
 <p>Note that lines 18-19 require that the <code>test</code> job defined above pass, and ensure
the job runs only on a push event to the <a href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/EasilyRenameYourGitDefaultBranchFromMasterToMain.aspx" title="Easily rename your Git default branch from master to main">main branch</a>, where  we push final
releases. We set <code>PGXN_USERNAME</code> and <code>PGXN_PASSWORD</code> from the secrets of the
same name, and then, in lines 27-32, check out the project, bundle it into a zip
file, and release it on PGXN.</p>
<p>There are a few more features of the image, so <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pgxn/pgxn-tools">read the docs</a>
for the details. As a first cut at PGXN <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD" title="Wikipedia: “CI/CD”">CI/CD</a> tools, I think it’s fairly
robust. Still, as I gain experience and build and release more extensions in the
coming year, I expect to work out integration with publishing <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-releases-in-a-repository">GitHub releases</a>,
and perhaps build and publish relevant actions on the <a href="https://github.com/marketplace">GitHub Marketplace</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Not a great name, I know, will probably change as I learn more.&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a></p>

  Fed up with all the empty content dominating search results, I started keeping track of useful information. I used only a fraction of my backround research for the articles I was writing, I thought I might collaborate with other information aggregators.

<p>I became captivated with computers in the early-mid ’90s, as the world wide web began to reach the consumer market. I was a total computer nerd, but never took it seriously.</p>

<p>I had no conception of how the world would be transformed, and ultimately decided that technology was simply one of many potential material pursuits. I took off to gather experience and pursue meaning, which kept me apart from the tech I loved, for most of the time.</p>

<p></p>

 After years bereft of meaningful direction, I needed a re-boot. 

<p>Finding safe haven where I could freely pursue a new direction and self-education. While I had been paying scant attention to the broader cultural movements or the advance of personal computing, the world had become transformed.</p>

<p>Feeling the pain of lost opportunities, I quickly realized I could have done almost anything if I had gotten serious about tech as a kid, I could have built a much nicer life for myself by that point.</p>

<p>Yet, I could see that the world has only begun its digital transformation, and opportunity abounds.</p>

<p>I’ve always loved to read and consume information, so I began writing freelance, in order to make some money while educating myself. If I could get paid to read, I thought… Now, that would be the ticket!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I hadn’t spent much time with the written word in a while, could barely keep my eyes focused on the screen, and I didn’t know anything about the modern tech landscape.</p>
</blockquote>

 Learn some markdown, and get blogging! 

<p>My style was rough, to start, but my dedication to internet search and relating accurate and precise information landed me some content gigs related to Bitcoin and data science.</p>

<p>Fed up with all the empty content dominating search results, I started keeping track of useful information. I used only a fraction of my background research for the articles I was writing, I thought I might collaborate with other information aggregators.</p>

<p>I wanted to make lists for various histories surrounding my topics of interest, since it’s a lot easier to understand anything if you can see where it came from and how it developed. Somewhere along the line, I realized I love information discovery and keeping track of fast moving information streams a lot more than I like writing.</p>

 Curated Lists: the Gold of the Internet 

<p>Coming upon a list of relevant materials someone else already sorted for me, that’s even better than finding a single source. Why write an article when I could make endless lists which could become a foundation for a variety of articles?</p>

<p>Then I thought “what if I could map out the various systems of information surrounding my subjects of interest.” This is the biggest challenge in tech that hardly anyone is working on. Sure plenty trying to write algorithms to save themselves the work of curation, but no-one is really tackling the problem head on.</p>

<p>Automation is just eating up jobs left and right, while curation is a purely human activity. You can augment curation, but you can’t automate it. You need a human to determine the value of a given resource in relation to the rest.</p>

<p>I see internet research and digital curation as making up a potentially massive portion of the future labor markets. This huge sector of the economy just waiting to transform the world.</p>

 I’d like to nurture that potential and help to create that reality! 

<blockquote>
  <p>A bigger wikipedia isn’t the answer, but a wikipedia full of curated lists might be a step in the right direction.</p>

<!-- use 'smarter' algorithm for cutoff snippet text

  Recognizing the collaborative potential for Discord Chat, during the ICO boom in 2017, I was inspired to begin collecting information about blockchain in the channels of a Discord Server dedicated for that purpose. After a year or so working relentlessly on whatever was in front of me at a given moment, its time to pause, reflect, and make a way for anyone following my work to be notified of update

<div class='wrap'>

<p>In the Summer of 2018, I had a seemingly foolish idea. I decided that I should try and organize all the types of information surrounding Bitcoin, Blockchain and Cryptocurrency in the channels of a discord server.</p>

<p>Recognizing the collaborative potential for Discord Chat, during the ICO boom in 2017, I was inspired to begin collecting information about blockchain in the channels of a Discord Server dedicated for that purpose.</p>

<p>After a year or so working relentlessly on whatever was in front of me at a given moment, its time to pause, reflect, and make a way for anyone following my work to be notified of updates.</p>

<p></p>

 A reasonably comprehensive grasp 

<p>A grasp of so many subjects is required for a reasonably comprehensive understanding of blockchain, cryptocurrency and relevant tech trends; eventually I broke my inquiry apart into multiple categories which spread across a dozen discord organizations with associated twitter accounts.</p>

<p>I learned to follow the professionals and organizations working in each field, using the retweet button to bookmark interesting posts, whose content I could review later with a fresh set of eyes for its substance and relevance.</p>

<p>I never assumed that I could actually accomplish the task, but I felt it was important to act and believe as though it was possible.</p>

<p>While I grew up a total computer nerd, I drifted from that early passion for many years, and only got serious about tech, more recently.</p>

<p>I have had quite a steep learning curve trying to catch up, but I paired that with an infinite curiosity and relentless pursuit of knowledge.</p>

 A Collaborative Workflow? 

<p>The idea that I could organize the varieties of information surrounding Bitcoin, in a comprehensive fashion, still seems foolish. Then again, it doesn’t seen quite so foolish as it did, when I began.</p>

<p>It’s always been my intent for these resources to be collaborative, and they have been open for such from the beginning.</p>

<p>While I’ve received assistance, in one form or another from a handful of contributors, the work has primarily been my own. I will admit that I’ve not always felt very social, or acted as an effective organizer.</p>

<p>Regardless, I’m pretty sure Discord isn’t the ideal venue for this work.</p>

 FOSS Ideals vs Pragmatism 

<p>The irony of a dependence on discord and twitter while laying a foundation for a Free and Open Source (FOSS) principled collaborative curation platform is not lost on me.</p>

<p>Discord was a matter of convenience, Twitter has played an essential component of my education, and is a primary public sphere for discourse on most of the subjects I’ve been studying.</p>

<p>Despite it’s shortcomings, there is plenty of value to be gained from studying various fields through the lense of Twitter.</p>

 Moving Forward 

<p>It’s time to move forward. I’d like to say I’m moving to 100% sovereign solutions, However, I’m not quite there yet. I have no definite answers, except that I’ll be restructuring this information into markdown and then structured data.</p>

<p>I’m just getting to know google sheets, and decided I should get to know the GSuite a little better while searching for a reasonable replacement.</p>

<p>Spreadsheets are extensible, and make an ideal stepping stone between unordered lists and a variety of applications.</p>

<p>I’ve also begun to include Notion as an integral component of my workflow. It allows me to easily transform html into markdown, which is perfect from all the enriched content I’ve been pulling from the social media.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I think a wiki of curated lists is a solid direction to aim towards.</p>

<p></p>

 Taking a Break from Socials 

<p>This post is meant to provide an update, since I’m taking a break from social media.</p>

<p>I have just been going full blast, trying to make up for lost time. Now its time for me to reassess my workflow, and figure out what is the best path forward.</p>

<p>That’s why I’m backing off from my day to day curation, so I can organize what I’ve got, learn some new tools, and take it all to the next level.</p>

<p>I’ve found myself enthralled by the intoxicating streams of information surrounding Bitcoin, in 2017. I began studying related histories: Cryptography, Programming, Digital Cash; while developing my technical skills with freelance work, and building small websites on related subjects.</p>

<p>Studying history is my antidote to the exceeding complexity of life. While Bitcoin and its network are rather complex to wrap your head around, learning about the history of cryptography makes it a lot easier.</p>

<p>If you proceed to study the history of other relevant subjects: from the global economy, wall street, and the creation of money; to the timeline and basic details surrounding the creation of various programming languages, little by little, Bitcoin becomes much easier to digest.</p>

 A few markdown files 

<p>This project began as a few markdown files in my first github repository, that gradually evolved into my homepage. I needed space for my endless curiosity to grow, and splitting the content off to multiple websites also helped me to develop my skills.</p>

<p>At each step I have used my interests to fuel my education and learned many difficult things for the ability share knowledge I’ve gathered, and increase my value in this rapidly evolving digital sphere.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now all of my content, and forked repositories, have become divided between a variety of GitHub Organizations and my user account. This makes it easy to publish websites built from multiple custom domains, without the need to rent server space for each of them.</p>

 I will keep building! 

<p>I’ve always hoped that I might find others interested in helping to create these resources, but appreciate that others may prefer to quietly gather resources for their own projects, and it could always get easier to contribute.</p>

<p>Either way, I like moving around information, organizing it in different ways, expanding my reach in the digital sphere, and experimenting with different ways of sharing it.</p>

<p>These projects have tended to multiply and then contract, in an iterative fashion, and over time the ideal structure of these cornerstones have beginning to emerge.</p>

 <a href='https://infominer.xyz/posts/blockchain-identity/'>Blockchain Identity Reources - TOML</a>

</h3>

<div class='item-body'>

<div class='item-snippet'>
<!-- use 'smarter' algorithm for cutoff snippet text
   note: summary goes first; than try content -->

  The inspiration for my work in digital identity might easily trace back to The Original Blockchain Identity list on GitHub, originally compiled by Markus Sabadello. /peacekeeper/blockchain-identity I leaned heavily on that resource when first learning about decentralized identity and blockchain.

<div class='item-content item-summary'>

<!-- todo: use sanitize or simplify or whitelist

 -->
<div class='wrap'>

<p>This is among my earliest posts, and came at a time when I first began to think about how can this project evolve into the future, beyond lists of links gathered and organized by hand?</p>

 Knowledge Defies Categorization 

<p>Part of the challenge I encountered is that information wont be neatly divided into categories. Fields of knowledge are all overlapping, and a given post will fit within multiple categories.</p>

<p>What I came to understand is that I should use some type of structured data, so that I required only a single entry of an item in the data file, for it to be featured within multiple categories, once the finished product was rendered.</p>

 Infominer meets Structured Data 

<p>When I began, I didn’t really know much about types of data.</p>

<p>I decided upon TOML because it’s user-friendly, and easy to read. Once data is structured in this way, it can be transformed to JSON, or whichever format works best for a given project.</p>

<p>This page has two toml files from <a href="https://github.com/infominer33/SourceCrypto">infominer33/SourceCrypto</a> embedded into it, marking a beginning in my effort to enhance my curation and publishing through automation.</p>

<p>I’ve always been good with a computer, but this was entering me into an entirely new domain. At the time of publication is when I began learning how to publish websites and use developers tools.</p>

 Future Direction 

 
   some simple way to check <a href="https://decentralized-id.com">didecentral.github.io</a> against these lists, and output a list of links that have yet to be included. 
   an app that will take a list of links as the input and output a toml file with title\description automatically populated based on metadata.. 
 

<p>(Crossing out these items, as now I can manage these tasks with python)</p>

<p>I suppose it would make the most sense to prioritize those objectives, rather than constructing everything by hand.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Scraping a list of links from wherever I want is simple.. so really the two things are checking a list of links against a toml file(s), outputting any links not found in the db already. Another script to construct a toml file grabbing metadata.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At this time I didn’t come to the logical conclusion of how easy it could have been to generate content based on the files embedded here. I was just getting in way over my head, and was hopeful someone coder would catch my enthusiasm and make the code for me.</p>

<p>Ultimately it has worked out fine and in 2023, finally coming around to this idea: full-circle.</p>

 Algorithmic tagging 

<blockquote>
  <p>what’s really missing is tagging all of these resources by authors, co-authors, references/citations</p>

  <p>once this is done, topical tags can be derived algorithmically<br>
<a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.397.8960&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Enabling Author-Centric Ranking of Web Content</a> - @MaciekLaskus on twitter</p>
</blockquote>
