<p>Last week, I attended and presented at <a href="https://www.citusdata.com/posette/2024" title="POSETTE: An Event for Postgres 2024">POSETTE</a>, An Event for Postgres. A
selection of the presentations I found worthy of attention.</p>
 Good Talks 
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3gLgN517JA">Comparing Postgres connection pooler support for prepared statements</a> by
<a href="https://www.citusdata.com/posette/speakers/jelte-fennema-nio/">Jelte Fennema-Nio</a>. Jelte did a great job outlining the challenges he
encountered adding protocol-level prepared query support to <a href="https://www.pgbouncer.org" title="Lightweight connection pooler for PostgreSQL">PgBouncer</a>. So
many edge cases! Very much a worthwhile effort, and an important contribution.
In the Discord “hallway track”, Jelte said he has some ideas how to add
support for <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-listen.html" title="Postgres Docs: LISTEN">LISTEN</a>/<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-notify.html" title="Postgres Docs: NOTIFY">NOTIFY</a>, which also requires connection affinity. Alas,
there’s no protocol-level support, so it’ll be tricky. I suspect I’ll
eventually move the <a href="https://botsin.space/@pgxn">PGXN Bot</a> to something like <a href="https://pgxn.org/dist/pgmq/" title="A lightweight message queue like AWS SQS or RSMQ, but on Postgres">pgmq</a> to avoid the issue.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z77AjEitFMA">How to work with other people</a> by <a href="https://www.citusdata.com/posette/speakers/jimmy-angelakos/">Jimmy Angelakos</a> and <a href="https://www.citusdata.com/posette/speakers/floor-drees/">Floor Drees</a>. Jimmy
&amp; Floor capably highlighted issues of neurodiversity and mental health in the
Postgres community and the workplace. I greatly appreciate the increasing
awareness of and discussions about these issues, which for far to long have
remained hidden or misunderstood. All too often they still are. The more
people talk about them, the more they’ll be accepted and the better things
will become. Love seeing this.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6X60ln2VNc">Even JSONB In Postgres Needs Schemas</a> by <a href="https://www.citusdata.com/posette/speakers/chris-ellis/">Chris Ellis</a>. Chris concisely
introduced the concept of JSON validation via <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-constraints.html" title="Postgres Docs: Constraints">check constraints</a> to ensure
the integrity of data. He started with simple validation with <code>json_typeof()</code>,
moved to more comprehensive validation of various parts of a JSON or JSONB
object, and ultimately full <a href="https://json-schema.org">JSON Schema</a> validation with the <a href="https://github.com/supabase/pg_jsonschema" title="PostgreSQL extension providing JSON Schema validation">pg_jsonschema</a>
extension. Having recently written my own <a href="https://pgxn.org/dist/jsonschema/" title="PGXN: jsonschema --- JSON Schema validation functions for PostgreSQL">JSON Schema extension</a>, I was happy
to see this topic receive more attention. The tool Chris developed to <a href="https://nexteam.co.uk/pg-jsonschema-gen/v1/index.html" title="PostgreSQL JSON Validation Function Generator">convert
JSON schema to a SQL function</a> seems super neat, too — a great way to
bootstrap a check constraint from a JSON Schema where no such extension
exists, such as the big cloud providers.</p>
 I Also Spoke 
<p>I also gave a talk, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6thIB2jw6w">State of the Postgres Extension Ecosystem</a>, expanding
upon my <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/03/mini-summit-one/" title="Mini Summit One">mini-Summit session</a>. I think it came out pretty well, and hope it
helps to get more people interested in extensions and solve the challenges for
finding, evaluating, installing, and using them everywhere. Slides:</p>

 Next Year 
<p>I found <a href="https://www.citusdata.com/posette/2024" title="POSETTE: An Event for Postgres 2024">POSETTE</a> a very nice Postgres conference. I applaud its commitment to
a fully-virtual venue. In-person get-togethers are great, but not everyone can
travel to them for reasons of cost, time, family, health, and more. Better
still, the speakers recorded their presentations in advance, allows us to
fully participate in discussion during our talks! (I mostly used my time to
offer corrections and links to relevant resources.)</p>
<p>For those interested in Postgres, I heartily endorse this free, fully remote
conference. Perhaps I’ll “see” you there next year.</p>

<p>Die Piratenpartei warnt vor der kommenden Abstimmung über die Chatkontrolle im Europaparlament. Seit mehreren Monaten warnt die Partei zusammen mit ihrem Europaabgeordneten Dr. Patrick Breyer vor dem Ende des Briefgeheimnisses im Netz.&nbsp;Gestern berichtete der SPIEGEL, dass das Bundeskriminalamt mehr als die Hälfte der Chats, Fotos und Videos, die freiwillig von US-Diensten geleakt wurden, im Jahr 2023 als “nicht strafrechtlich relevant” eingestuft wurden – so viele wie nie zuvor.[1] Heute wurde von POLITICO der finale Gesetzestext geleakt, der bisher sicher Ende-zu-Ende-verschlüsselte Apps wie Whatsapp oder Signal weltweit erstmals zum Einbau einer Überwachungsfunktionen zwingen würde.[2] Signal hat angekündigt, seine Dienste eher in der EU einzustellen als die verlangten Überwachungsfunktionen einzubauen. Das in der Schweiz ansässige Unternehmen Threema meldete heute, ebenfalls von der Chatkontrolle betroffen zu sein. Es werde nötigenfalls “andere Kommunikationsdienste aufrufen, die EU mit uns zu verlassen.”[3]</p>



<p>Die PIRATEN rufen dazu auf, kurz vor der Abstimmung noch einmal laut zu werden und gegen die Chatkontrolle zu protestieren.[4]</p>



<p>„Dass eine Technologie wie die Chatkontrolle Unschuldige treffen wird, ist kein hypothetisches Szenario, sondern Realität“, so Lukas Küffner, Vorsitzender der Piratenpartei. „Noch ist jedoch nichts entschieden. Es liegt an jedem Einzelnen, Einfluss auf die Abgeordneten im EU-Parlament zu nehmen. Wir brauchen Proteste, online und offline. Ist die Chatkontrolle erst einmal besiegelt, birgt sie unkontrollierbares Missbrauchspotential.“</p>



<p>Der EU-Abgeordnete Dr. Patrick Breyer kommentiert: “Wir stehen am Rande eines so extremen Überwachungsregimes, wie es nirgendwo sonst in der freien Welt existiert. Nicht einmal Russland und China haben es geschafft, Wanzen in unsere Smartphones einbauen zu lassen, wie es die EU beabsichtigt. Um Kritiker innerhalb der französischen Regierung zum Schweigen zu bringen und die Öffentlichkeit zu täuschen, enthält der endgültige Gesetzestext Lippenbekenntnisse zu sicherer Verschlüsselung, während er sie in Wirklichkeit zerstört, wie Hunderte von Wissenschaftlern deutlich gemacht haben. Die EU-Regierungen verstehen das sehr gut, wie die Ausnahme in Artikel 7 für ‘Nutzerkonten, die vom Staat für Zwecke der nationalen Sicherheit, der Aufrechterhaltung von Recht und Ordnung oder für militärische Zwecke verwendet werden’ zeigt. Ob verschlüsselt oder nicht: Wahllose Durchsuchungen und fehleranfällige Leaks privater Chats und intimer Fotos zerstören unser digitales Briefgeheimnis. Wenn die Chatkontrolle durchkommt, wird sie der ständigen Überwachung unserer privaten Chats für jedgliche Zwecke Tür und Tor öffnen, wie es Europol bereits gefordert hat. Der Logik der Chatkontrolle folgend wäre das verdachtslose Öffnen und Scannen aller unserer Briefe der nächste Schritt.”</p>



<p>Im Vorfeld der Abstimmung am Mittwoch trifft sich morgen eine Arbeitsgruppe zu einer “Fragen und Antworten”-Sitzung zu dem Vorschlag[5].</p>



<p>Anlaufstellen, um den eigenen Protest zu äußern, sind die Ständigen Vertretungen der Regierung in der Europäischen Union sowie alle Social Media-Kanäle.</p>

   I gave a talk about accessing Large Language Models from the command-line last week as part of the Mastering LLMs: A Conference For Developers &amp; Data Scientists six week long online conference. The talk focused on my LLM Python command-line utility and ways you can use it (and its plugins) to explore LLMs and use them for useful tasks. 

 The talk was recorded and is available on YouTube. Here

  <p>I gave a talk about accessing Large Language Models from the command-line last week as part of the <a href="https://maven.com/parlance-labs/fine-tuning">Mastering LLMs: A Conference For Developers &amp; Data Scientists</a> six week long online conference. The talk focused on my <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a> Python command-line utility and ways you can use it (and <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/plugins/index.html">its plugins</a>) to explore LLMs and use them for useful tasks.</p>

<p>The talk was recorded and is available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUXQNi6jQ30">on YouTube</a>. Here I've turned it into an <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/annotatedtalks/">annotated presentation</a>, with detailed notes and screenshots (there were no slides) to accompany the video.</p>



  <p><a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a> is a tool I started building last year to help run LLM prompts directly from a command-line terminal. Instructions for installing it <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/setup.html">are here</a> - you can use <code>pipx install llm</code> or <code>pip install llm</code> or <code>brew install llm</code>.</p>

 
  <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/llm/frame_000003.jpg"></a>
  <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/17/cli-language-models/#frame_000003.jpg">#</a>

<p>Once installed you can use it with OpenAI models by running <code>llm keys set openai</code> and pasting in your OpenAI key - or <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/plugins/directory.html#plugin-directory">install plugins</a> to use models by other providers, including models you can run locally.</p>
 
 
  <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/llm/frame_000259.jpg"></a>
  <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/17/cli-language-models/#frame_000259.jpg">#</a>
  <p>Basic usage is very simple: once you've configured your OpenAI key, you can run prompts against their models like this:</p>
 <code>llm 'five great names for a pet pelican'
</code> 
<p>The output will stream to your terminal, or you can redirect it to a file like this:</p>
 <code>llm 'five great names for a pet pelican' &gt; pelicans.txt
</code> 
 
 
  <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/llm/frame_000341.jpg"></a>
  <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/17/cli-language-models/#frame_000341.jpg">#</a>
  <p>You can use the <code>-c</code> (for continue) option to send follow-up prompts as part of the same ongoing conversation:</p>
 <code>llm -c 'now do walruses'
# ...
llm -c justify those!'
</code> 
 
 
  <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/llm/frame_000506.jpg"></a>
  <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/17/cli-language-models/#frame_000506.jpg">#</a>
  <p>LLM supports additional models via plugins. These are listed in the <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/plugins/directory.html">LLM plugins directory</a>, with dozens of plugins for both remote API-hosted models as well as models you can run directly on your own computer.</p>
 
 
  <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/llm/frame_000704.jpg"></a>
  <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/17/cli-language-models/#frame_000704.jpg">#</a>
  <p>Here I'm using the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-claude-3">llm-claude-3</a> plugin, which provides access to the Anthropic <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-family">Claude 3 family</a> of models.</p>
<p>I really like these models. Claude 3 Opus is about equivalent to GPT-4o in terms of quality. Claude 3 Haiku is both cheaper and better than GPT-3.5, and can handle 100,000 input tokens including images.</p>
 <code>llm install llm-claude-3
llm keys set claude
# &lt;Paste key here&gt;
# Now list available models
llm models
# Then run a prompt
llm -m claude-3-haiku-20240307 'say hi in spanish with a flourish'
# Or use the haiku alias
llm -m haiku 'say hi in spanish with a flourish'
</code> 
 
 
  <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/llm/frame_000818.jpg"></a>
  <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/17/cli-language-models/#frame_000818.jpg">#</a>
  <p>Every prompt and response run through the LLM tool is permanently logged to a SQLite database, <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/logging.html">as described here</a>.</p>
<p>This command shows the path to that database:</p>
 <code>llm logs path
</code> 
<p>If you install <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a> you can use it to browse your SQLite database like this, using a terminal trick where the output of one command is passed to another (with double quotes to avoid any problems caused by the space in the directory name):</p>
 <code>datasette "$(llm logs path)"
</code> 
 
 
  <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/llm/frame_000832.jpg"></a>
  <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/17/cli-language-models/#frame_000832.jpg">#</a>
  <p>Here's my searchable database of 2,434 responses I've logged from using LLM on my laptop, running in Datasette.</p>
 
 
  <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/llm/frame_000853.jpg"></a>
  <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/17/cli-language-models/#frame_000853.jpg">#</a>
  <p>Earlier we ran a prompt and then sent two follow-up prompts to it using the <code>llm -c</code> option. Those are stored in the database as three responses that are part of the same conversation.</p>
 
 
  <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/llm/frame_000924.jpg"></a>
  <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/17/cli-language-models/#frame_000924.jpg">#</a>
  <p>Datasette supports facets, which provide a quick overview of unique value counts within the data. I've used GPT-3.5 turbo 383 times, Claude 3 Opus 334 times and a whole bunch of other models.</p>

  <p>Datasette provides search and filtering too - here are the prompts I've run against Claude 3 Opus that match "pelican".</p>
<p>I have an experimental feature that lets me pass images to some models using the <code>-i filename.png</code> option. More on that <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/331">in this issue</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-cmd">llm-cmd</a> is an example of a plugin that adds an extra sub-command to LLM - in this case one that takes a description of a task and turns that into a pre-populated shell command. I wrote more about that in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Mar/26/llm-cmd/">llm cmd undo last git commit—a new plugin for LLM</a>.</p>

  <p>There are plenty of ways to run local models using LLM. One of my favourite is with the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-gpt4all">llm-gpt4all</a> plugin, which builds on top of the excellent <a href="https://gpt4all.io/index.html">GPT4All</a> Python library by Nomic AI.</p>
 
 
  <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/llm/frame_001450.jpg"></a>
  <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/17/cli-language-models/#frame_001450.jpg">#</a>
  <p>To install that plugin:</p>
 <code>llm install llm-gpt4all
</code> 
<p>Then <code>llm models</code> to list the new models. Each model will be downloaded the first time you try running a prompt through it.</p>
<p>I used this to run Mistral-7B Instruct - an extremely high quality small (~4GB) model:</p>
 <code>llm -m mistral-7b-instruct-v0 'five great names for a pet seagull, with explanations'
</code> 
<p>You can run Activity Monitory to see the resources the model is using.</p>
 
 
  <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/llm/frame_001544.jpg"></a>
  <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/17/cli-language-models/#frame_001544.jpg">#</a>
  <p>Running prompts like this is inefficient, because it loads the full model into memory, runs the prompt and then shuts down the program again.</p>
<p>Instead, you can use the <code>llm chat</code> command which keeps the model in memory across multiple prompts:</p>
 <code>llm chat -m mistral-7b-instruct-v0
</code> 
<p>Another option is to run <a href="https://ollama.com/">Ollama</a>, which runs its own local server hosting models. The <a href="https://github.com/taketwo/llm-ollama">llm-ollama</a> plugin can then be used to run prompts through Ollama from LLM.</p>

  <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/17/cli-language-models/#frame_002013.jpg">#</a>
  <p>Another really exciting option for running models is <a href="https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile">llamafile</a>, a project sponsored by Mozilla that uses Justine Tunney's <a href="https://justine.lol/cosmo3/">Cosmopolitan</a> to compile a binary that bundles both a model and the software needed to serve it, in a single file that can execute on several different operating systems.</p>
<p>I've written more about that here:</p>
 
 <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Nov/29/llamafile/">llamafile is the new best way to run a LLM on your own computer

  <p>Running <a href="https://llava-vl.github.io/">LLaVA</a> using a Llamafile is particularly fun - it's an openly licensed model that can accept images as input as well. It's pretty amazing the results you can get from that, running as a single binary on your laptop.</p>
<p>Grab that from <a href="https://huggingface.co/Mozilla/llava-v1.5-7b-llamafile">Mozilla/llava-v1.5-7b-llamafile</a> on Hugging Face.</p>
<p>LLM can talk to Llamafile instances via the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-llamafile">llm-llamafile</a> plugin.</p>

  <p>Now that we can run prompts from our terminal, we can start assembling software by writing scripts.</p>
<p>Here's a Bash script I wrote to summarize conversations on Hacker News, using longer context models such as Claude 3 Haiku or Google Gemini 1.5 or GPT-4o.</p>
<p>I wrote more about this in <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/llms/claude-hacker-news-themes">Summarizing Hacker News discussion themes with Claude and LLM</a>.</p>
 
 
  <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/llm/frame_002850.jpg"></a>
  <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/17/cli-language-models/#frame_002850.jpg">#</a>
  <p>The script works by hitting the Hacker News Algolia API to return the full, nested JSON structure of the conversation (e.g. <a href="https://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/items/40651054">this JSON endpoint</a> for <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40651054">this conversation</a>), then runs that through <code>jq</code> to turn it into text, then pipes that into a model using LLM.</p>
 
 
  <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/llm/frame_003325.jpg"></a>
  <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/17/cli-language-models/#frame_003325.jpg">#</a>
  <p>If you want to contribute to LLM itself, a great way to do that is to write plugins that support new models. I have <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/plugins/tutorial-model-plugin.html">an extensive tutorial</a> describing how to do that.</p>
 
 
  <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/llm/frame_003440.jpg"></a>
  <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/17/cli-language-models/#frame_003440.jpg">#</a>
  <p>Another fun trick is to use templates to save and execute parameterized prompts, <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/templates.html">documented here</a>. The easiest way to create a template is with the <code>--save</code> option like this:</p>
 <code>llm --system 'You are a sentient cheesecake' -m gpt-4o --save cheesecake
</code> 
<p>Now you can chat with a cheesecake:</p>
 <code>llm chat -t cheesecake
</code> 
 
 
  <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/llm/frame_003532.jpg"></a>
  <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/17/cli-language-models/#frame_003532.jpg">#</a>
  <p>Being able to pipe content into <code>llm</code> is a really important feature.</p>
<p>The simplest way to do this is with <code>cat</code> to send in files. This command summarizes the content of a provided file:</p>
 <code>cat demos.md | llm -s 'summary, short'
</code> 
 
 
  <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/llm/frame_003552.jpg"></a>
  <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/17/cli-language-models/#frame_003552.jpg">#</a>
  <p>Once you've done this you can send follow-up prompts with <code>-c</code>.</p>
 <code>llm -c 'no much much much shorter, and in haikus'
</code> 
 
 
  <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/llm/frame_003619.jpg"></a>

  <p>My <a href="https://github.com/simonw/files-to-prompt">files-to-prompt</a> command can turn a directory of files into a single prompt, suitable for piping into LLM.</p>
<p>I wrote more about this, including how I developed it, in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Apr/8/files-to-prompt/">Building files-to-prompt entirely using Claude 3 Opus</a>.</p>
 
 
  <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/llm/frame_003715.jpg"></a>
  <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/17/cli-language-models/#frame_003715.jpg">#</a>
 <p>Another tool I frequently use with LLM is <a href="https://shot-scraper.datasette.io/">shot-scraper</a> - my command-line tool for screenshotting and scraping websites.</p>  
 
 
  <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/llm/frame_003736.jpg"></a>
  <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/17/cli-language-models/#frame_003736.jpg">#</a>

<p><code>shot-scraper</code> can <a href="https://shot-scraper.datasette.io/en/stable/javascript.html">run JavaScript directly against a page</a> and output the result back to the terminal, suitable for piping into LLM.</p>
 
 
  <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/llm/frame_003832.jpg"></a>
  <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/17/cli-language-models/#frame_003832.jpg">#</a>
  <p>Google hate being scraped. Let's use it to scrape Google.</p>
<p>Google search results have a structure where each link on the page is an <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> element wrapped in a link.</p>
 
 
  <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/llm/frame_003844.jpg"></a>
  <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/17/cli-language-models/#frame_003844.jpg">#</a>
  <p>We can scrape that using the following terminal command:</p>
 <code>shot-scraper javascript 'https://www.google.com/search?q=nytimes+slop' '
Array.from(
  document.querySelectorAll("h3"),
  el =&gt; ({href: el.parentNode.href, title: el.innerText})
)'
</code> 
<p>This will load up the search results page in an invisible browser, then execute JavaScript that extracts the results and returns them as JSON.</p>
 
 
  <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/llm/frame_003856.jpg"></a>
  <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/17/cli-language-models/#frame_003856.jpg">#</a>
  <p>The results as JSON include the <code>href</code> and <code>title</code> of each of those search results.</p>
<p>We could send that to LLM, but I'd like to grab the search snippets as well.</p>
 
 
  <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/llm/frame_003914.jpg"></a>
  <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/17/cli-language-models/#frame_003914.jpg">#</a>
  <p>Here's the more complex recipe that also fetches the search snippets visible on the page:</p>
 <code>shot-scraper javascript 'https://www.google.com/search?q=nytimes+slop' '
() =&gt; {
    function findParentWithHveid(element) {
        while (element &amp;&amp; !element.hasAttribute("data-hveid")) {
            element = element.parentElement;
        }
        return element;
    }
    return Array.from(
        document.querySelectorAll("h3"),
        el =&gt; findParentWithHveid(el).innerText
    );
}' | llm -s 'describe slop'
</code> 
<p>At the end it pipes them into LLM with instructions to use that context to "describe slop".</p>
 
 
  <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/llm/frame_003931.jpg"></a>
  <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/17/cli-language-models/#frame_003931.jpg">#</a>
  <p>... and it works! We get back an answer from the LLM that summarizes the search results that we just scraped.</p>
<p>We have implemented basic RAG - Retrieval Augmented Generation, where search results are used to answer a question - using a terminal script that scrapes search results from Google and pipes them into an LLM.</p>
 
 
  <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/llm/frame_004133.jpg"></a>
  <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/17/cli-language-models/#frame_004133.jpg">#</a>
  <p>Speaking of RAG... a common technique for implementing that pattern is to take advantage of embeddings and vector search to find content that is semantically similar to the user's question, without necessarily matching on exact keywords.</p>
<p>I wrote an extensive introduction to embeddings in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Oct/23/embeddings/">Embeddings: What they are and why they matter</a>.</p>
<p>LLM includes support for calculating, storing and searching embeddings through its <code>llm embed-models</code>, <code>llm embed</code> and <code>llm embed-multi</code> commands, <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/embeddings/index.html">documented here</a>.</p>
<p>The <code>llm embed-models</code> command lists currently available embedding models - the OpenAI models plus any that have been added by plugins.</p>
 
 
  <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/llm/frame_004239.jpg"></a>
  <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/17/cli-language-models/#frame_004239.jpg">#</a>
  <p>The <code>llm embed</code> command can embed content. This will output a list of floating point numbers for the specified content, using the OpenAI 3-small embedding model.</p>
 <code>llm embed -m 3-small -c "hello there"
</code> 
<p>Add <code>-f hex</code> to get that out as hexadecimal. Neither of these formats are particularly useful on their own!</p>
 
 
  <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/llm/frame_004332.jpg"></a>
  <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/17/cli-language-models/#frame_004332.jpg">#</a>
  <p>The <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/embeddings/cli.html#llm-embed-multi">llm embed-multi</a> command is much more useful. It can run embeddings against content in bulk - from a CSV or JSON file, from a directory full of content or even from a SQLite database. Those embedding vectors will be stored in SQLite ready to be used for search or similarity queries.</p>
 
 
  <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/llm/frame_004418.jpg"></a>
  <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/17/cli-language-models/#frame_004418.jpg">#</a>
  <p>I collect bookmarks (I call them "blogmarks") on my blog - links with short descriptions. I have <a href="https://simonwillison.net/search/?type=blogmark">over 7,178 of them</a>.</p>
<p>Let's create embeddings for all of those using LLM.</p>
<p>I used the SQLite database version of my blog available from <code>https://datasette.simonwillison.net/simonwillisonblog.db</code> (a 90MB file).</p>
 
 
  <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/llm/frame_004424.jpg"></a>
  <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/17/cli-language-models/#frame_004424.jpg">#</a>
  <p>The content lives in the <a href="https://datasette.simonwillison.net/simonwillisonblog/blog_blogmark">blog_blogmark</a> SQLite table, which I can explore using Datasette (in this case the <a href="https://datasette.io/desktop">Datasette Desktop</a> macOS Electron app).</p>
 
 
  <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/llm/frame_004444.jpg"></a>
  <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/17/cli-language-models/#frame_004444.jpg">#</a>
  <p>First step is to compose a SQL query returning the data we want to embed. The first column will be treated as a unique identifier to store along with the embedding vector, and any subsequent columns will be used as input to the embedding model.</p>
 <code>select id, link_url, link_title, commentary from blog_blogmark
</code> 
 
 
  <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/llm/frame_004502.jpg"></a>
  <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/17/cli-language-models/#frame_004502.jpg">#</a>
  <p>I can run this command to embed all of the content:</p>
 <code>llm embed-multi links \
  -d simonwillisonblog.db \
  --sql 'select id, link_url, link_title, commentary from blog_blogmark' \
  -m 3-small --store
</code> 
<p>This will create an embedding collection called "links". It will run the SQL query we created before, using the OpenAI <code>3-small</code> model. The <code>--store</code> link means it will store a copy of the text in the database as well - without that it would just store identifiers and we would need to use those to look up the text later on when running queries.</p>
 
 
  <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/llm/frame_004521.jpg"></a>
  <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/17/cli-language-models/#frame_004521.jpg">#</a>
  <p>The <code>llm embed-multi</code> command shows a progress bar for how far it has got.</p>
 
 
  <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/llm/frame_004539.jpg"></a>
  <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/17/cli-language-models/#frame_004539.jpg">#</a>
  <p>While the command is running we can use Datasette to watch as the <code>embeddings</code> table is filled with data - one row for each of the items we are embedding, each storing a big ugly binary blob of data representing the embedding vector (in <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/embeddings/storage.html">this storage format</a>).</p>
 
 
  <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/llm/frame_004720.jpg"></a>
  <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/17/cli-language-models/#frame_004720.jpg">#</a>
  <p>And now we can run searches! This command finds everything in the "links" collection that is most similar to the search term "things that make me angry":</p>
 <code>llm similar links -c 'things that make me angry' -d simonwillisonblog.db
</code> 
 
 
  <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/llm/frame_004824.jpg"></a>
  <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/17/cli-language-models/#frame_004824.jpg">#</a>
  <p>We can implement another version of RAG on top of this as well, by finding similar documents to our search term and then piping those results back into LLM to execute a prompt.</p>
<p>I wrote more about this in <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/llms/embed-paragraphs">Embedding paragraphs from my blog with E5-large-v2</a>.</p>
 
 
  <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/llm/frame_005209.jpg"></a>
  <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/17/cli-language-models/#frame_005209.jpg">#</a>
  <p>During the Q&amp;A I mentioned that LLM can talk to anything that provides an OpenAI-compatible API endpoint using just configuration, no extra code. That's <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/other-models.html#openai-compatible-models">described in the documentation here</a>.</p>
 
 
  <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/llm/frame_005333.jpg"></a>
  <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/17/cli-language-models/#frame_005333.jpg">#</a>
  <p>I also showed LLM's <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/python-api.html">Python API documentation</a>, but warned that this is not yet considered stable as I'm not 100% happy with how this API works yet.</p>
 
 
  <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/llm/frame_010311.jpg"></a>
  <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/17/cli-language-models/#frame_010311.jpg">#</a>
  <p>The final question from the audience was about my personal productivity.</p>
<p>I wrote a bit about this a few years ago in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Nov/26/productivity/">Coping strategies for the serial project hoarder</a> - how I use extensive documentation and unit tests to allow me to work on way more projects at once by ensuring I don't have to remember the details of any of them.</p>
<p>My other trick is that I tend to pick projects that fit my unique combination of previous experiences. I built LLM because I already had experience with LLM APIs, Python CLI tools (using <a href="https://click.palletsprojects.com/">Click</a>) and plugin systems (using <a href="https://pluggy.readthedocs.io/">Pluggy</a>). As a result I happened to be one of the best positioned people in the world to build a plugin-based CLI tool for working with LLMs!</p>
 

 Colophon 
<p>Here's how I turned the YouTube video of this talk into an annotated presentation:</p>
 
 I downloaded a <code>.mp4</code> version of the talk from YouTube using <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp">yt-dlp</a>. 
 I ran that through <a href="https://goodsnooze.gumroad.com/l/macwhisper">MacWhisper</a> to create my own transcript for copying extracts from into my write-up - although this time I didn't end up using any of the transcript text. 
 I played the video (at 2x speed) in QuickTime Player and used the <code>capture.sh</code> script <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/macos/quicktime-capture-script">described here</a> to grab screenshots of the individual interesting frames that I wanted to use for my post. 
 I loaded those screenshots into <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/tools/annotated-presentations">my annotated presentation tool</a> (which I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Aug/6/annotated-presentations/">described in this post</a>) and used that to run OCR against them for alt text and to add commentary to accompany each screenshot. 
 I assembled the result into this finished blog entry, adding intro text and the YouTube embed as HTML.

I say relative because identity is not simple, so we should not expect simple solutions.</p></blockquote><p>This post is my attempt to do that for Alan and others.</p><p>Identity is how we recognize, remember, react to, and interact with other people, organizations, and services. Put another way, identity is about <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml">relationships</a>. Online we suffer from a <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2017/10/fixing_the_five_problems_of_internet_identity.shtml">proximity problem</a>. Since we're not near the parties we want to have relationships with, our natural means of recognizing, remembering, and interacting with others can't be used. Digital identity systems are meant to provide us with the means of creating online relationships.</p><p>Traditional identity systems have not served us well because they are owned and controlled by companies who build them for their own purposes. The relationships they support are <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/authentic_digital_relationships.shtml#anemic">anemic and transactional</a>. We can't use them for any purpose except what their owners allow.</p><p>Decentralized identity systems1 on the other hand allow you to create online relationships with any person, organization, or service you choose and give you the tools to manage and use those relationships. They help you recognize, remember, react to, and interact with them. The most important tool is a <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2022/12/wallets_and_agents.shtml">decentralized identity wallet</a>. The world of decentralized identity wallets is still young, but organizations like the Linux Foundation's <a href="https://openwallet.foundation/">Open Wallet Foundation</a> give me hope that useful, interoperable wallets are a tool we'll all be able to use soon. They are as foundational to decentralized identity as a browser is to the web.</p><p>Besides helping you manage peer-to-peer relationships with others online, wallets hold <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">verifiable credentials</a>, the digital analog to the credentials and cards you carry in a physical wallet. One of the most important aspects of digital relationships is providing information about yourself to those you interact with. Sometimes that information can come from you—it's self-asserted—but many times the other party wants to reliably know what others say about you. For example, if you establish a banking relationship, the bank is legally obligated to verify things like your name and address independent of what you say. Decentralized identity wallets allow you to prove things about yourself using credentials others provide to you. At the same time, they protect your privacy by limiting the information disclosed and forgoing the need for the party you're interacting with to directly contact others to verify the information you provide.</p><p>In summary, decentralized identity systems allow you to create digital relationships with other parties independently, without relying on any other organization or service. These relationships are direct, private, and secure. They also provide the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/06/ssi_interaction_patterns.shtml">means for you to prove things about yourself</a> inside these relationships so that even though you're operating at a distance, you and the other party can have confidence in the relationship's authenticity.</p> How Does It Work <p>The preceding paragraphs say what decentralized identity is, and provide its benefits, but don't say how it works. Alan and others will likely want a few more details. Everything I describe below is handled by the wallet. The person using the wallet doesn't need to have any more knowledge of how they work than the operator of a browser needs to understand HTTP and HTML.</p><p>The foundation of a peer-to-peer, decentralized online relationship is an <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml#autonomic">autonomic identifier</a> like a <a href="https://identity.foundation/peer-did-method-spec/index.html">peer DID</a>. Identifiers are handles that someone else can use to identify someone or something else online. Peer DIDs can be created by a wallet at will, they're free, and they're self-certifying (i.e., there's no third party). A relationship is created when two identity wallets create and exchange peer DIDs with each other on behalf of their owners. Peer DIDs allow the parties to the relationship to exchange private, secure messages.</p><p>There are four primary interaction patterns that wallets undertake when exchanging messages:</p>  <p><a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/06/ssi_interaction_patterns.shtml#didauth">DID Authentication</a> which uses the DIDs to authenticate each other</p>  <p><a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/06/ssi_interaction_patterns.shtml#single_party">Single-Party Credential Authorization</a> where the same party issues and verifies the credential.</p>  <p><a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/06/ssi_interaction_patterns.shtml#multi_party">Multi-Party Authorization</a> where the credential issuer and verifier are different parties.</p>  <p><a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/06/ssi_interaction_patterns.shtml#data_transfer">Generalized Trustworthy Data Transfer</a> which uses a collection of credentials to aid the wallet owner in completing online workflows.</p>   <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33d96d89-ebc7-4b3b-b2d3-a958a73de187_768x688.heic">    </a>Generalized credential exchange pattern <p>Verifiable credentials make heavy use of cryptography to provide not only security and privacy, but also confidence that the credential data is authentic. This confidence is based on four properties a properly designed credential presentation protocol provides:</p>  <p>The identifier of the credential issuer</p>  <p>Proof that the credential is being presented by the party it was issued to</p>  <p>Proof that the credential has not been tampered with</p>  <p>The revocation status of the credential</p>  <p>The credential presentation can do all this while only disclosing the information needed for the interaction and without the verifier having to contact the credential issuer. Not having to contact the issuer ensures the credential can be used in situations with poor connectivity, that the issuer needn't be online, and preserves the credential subject's privacy about where the credential is being used.</p><p>A properly designed credential exchange protocol has four important properties:</p>  <p>The system is decentralized and contextual. There is no central authority for all credentials. Every party can be an issuer, an owner, and a verifier. The system can be adapted to any country, any industry, any community, any set of credentials, any set of trust relationships.</p>  <p>Issuers are free to determine what credentials to issue and whether or not to revoke them.</p>  <p>Wallet owners are free to choose which credentials to carry and where and when they get shared. While some verifiers require a specific credential—such as a customs agent requiring a passport—others will accept a range of credentials. Therefore owners can decide which credentials to carry in their wallet based on the verifiers with whom they interact.</p>  <p>Verifiers make their own decisions about which credentials to accept. For example, a bar you are trying to enter may accept any credential you have about your date of birth. This means some credentials (e.g., passports, driving licenses, birth certificates) may be much more useful than just for the original purpose for which they were issued.</p>  <p>These properties make a decentralized identity system <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2016/10/on_sovereignty.shtml">self sovereign</a>.</p> Why is Decentralized Identity Important? <p>Decentralized identity systems are designed to provide people with control, security, and privacy while enhancing the confidence we have in our online relationships. Some time ago, I wrote the following. I think it’s an apt way to close to any discussion of decentralized identity because unless we keep our eyes on the goal, we’ll likely take shortcuts in implementation that fail to live up to their promise.</p><p>Presently, people don’t have operational relationships anywhere online.2 We have plenty of online relationships, but they are not operational because we are prevented from acting by their anemic natures. Our helplessness is the result of the power imbalance that is inherent in bureaucratic relationships. The solution to the anemic relationships created by administrative identity systems is to provide people with the tools they need to operationalize their self-sovereign authority and act as peers with others online. Peer-to-peer relationships are the norm in the physical world. When we dine at a restaurant or shop at a store in the physical world, we do not do so under the control of some administrative system. Rather, we act as embodied agents and operationalize our relationships, whether they be long-lived or nascent, by acting for ourselves. Any properly designed decentralized identity system must provide people with the tools they need to be “embodied” in the digital world and act autonomously.</p><p>Time and again, various people have tried to create decentralized marketplaces or social networks only to fail to gain traction. These systems fail because they are not based on a firm foundation that allows people to act in relationships with sovereign authority in systems mediated through protocol rather than by the whims of companies. We have a fine example of a protocol mediated system in the internet, but we’ve failed to take up the daunting task of building the same kind of system for identity. Consequently, when we act, we do so without firm footing or sufficient leverage.</p><p>Ironically, the internet broke down the walled gardens of CompuServe and Prodigy with a protocol-mediated metasystem, but surveillance capitalism has rebuilt them on the web. No one could live an effective life in an amusement park. Similarly, we cannot function as fully embodied agents in the digital sphere within the administrative systems of surveillance capitalists, despite their attractions. The emergence of self-sovereign identity, agreements on protocols, and the creation of metasystems to operationalize them promises a digital world where decentralized interactions create life-like online experiences. The richer relationships that result from properly designed decentralized identity systems promise an online future that gives people the opportunity to act for themselves as autonomous human beings and supports their dignity so that they can live an effective online life.</p>    Notes   <p>I prefer the term self-sovereign to decentralized because it describes the goal rather than the implementation, but I’ll stick with decentralized here. All self-sovereign identity systems are decentralized. Not all decentralized identity systems are self-sovereign.</p>  <p>The one exception I can think of to this is email. People act through email all the time in ways that aren’t intermediated by their email provider. Again, it’s a result of the architecture of email, set up over four decades ago and the culture that architecture supports.</p>  <p>Photo Credit: Young Woman Using a Wallet from DALL-E (public domain) Prompt: draw a rectangular picture of a young woman using a wallet.</p><p></p>

<p>I took a walk through the thick southern heat down to the Mount Holly Cemetery today to crack a new book. I enjoyed the shade of the magnolia next to a Victorian fountain. I gathered loose bits along the paths and made a heart as a tribute to my dad. It’s my first Father’s Day without him. I was born in Fort Worth, TX and lived there until I was six years old. My parents had a ranch house and behind the patio was a mimosa tree full of wavy pink blossoms. My dad put in a sandbox around its base, and I spent many hours there making imaginary cities and hunting ant lions. You might see a few mimosas up north, but they are abundant down here in Arkansas. I didn’t realize how long their bloom time is. Every time I see one, I imagine it as a hug from my dad to me across the divide. Happy Father’s Day Daddy. I miss you.</p>

<p>Add <code>r.jina.ai</code> to the front of a URL to get back Markdown of that page, for example <a href="https://r.jina.ai/https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/16/jina-ai-reader/">https://r.jina.ai/https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/16/jina-ai-reader/</a> - in addition to converting the content to Markdown it also does a decent job of extracting just the content and ignoring the surrounding navigation.</p>
<p>The API is free but rate-limited (presumably by IP) to 20 requests per minute without an API key or 200 request per minute with a free API key, and you can pay to increase your allowance beyond that.</p>
<p>The Apache 2 licensed source code for the hosted service is <a href="https://github.com/jina-ai/reader">on GitHub</a> - it's written in TypeScript and <a href="https://github.com/jina-ai/reader/blob/main/backend/functions/src/services/puppeteer.ts">uses Puppeteer</a> to run <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/readability">Readabiliy.js</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mixmark-io/turndown">Turndown</a> against the scraped page.</p>
<p>It can also handle PDFs, which have their contents extracted <a href="https://github.com/jina-ai/reader/blob/main/backend/functions/src/services/pdf-extract.ts">using PDF.js</a>.</p>
<p>There's also a search feature, <code>s.jina.ai/search+term+goes+here</code>, which <a href="https://github.com/jina-ai/reader/blob/main/backend/functions/src/services/brave-search.ts">uses the Brave Search API</a>.</p>

These are solid guidelines, and hopefully the precursor to more meaningful action when vendors inevitably cross the line.</p><p>While these points are all important, for me the most pertinent is the last:</p><blockquote><p>"Don’t violate consumer privacy rights. These avatars and bots can collect or infer a lot of intensely personal information. Indeed, some companies are marketing as a feature the ability of such AI services to know everything about us. It’s imperative that companies are honest and transparent about the collection and use of this information and that they don’t surreptitiously change privacy policies or relevant terms of service."</p></blockquote><p>It's often unclear how much extra data is being gathered behind the scenes when AI features are added. This is where battles will be fought and lines will be drawn, particularly in enterprises and well-regulated industries.</p>

We should all be reducing our air travel overall anyway, given the climate crisis, and in a world where we all fly less, shouldn't we choose a better experience?</p><p>This sounds like the absolute worst:</p><blockquote><p>"United believes its advertising network will be appealing to brands because “there is the potential for 3.5 hours of attention per traveler, based on average flight time.”"</p></blockquote><p>Passengers from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Virginia, and Utah can opt out of having their private information used to show targeted ads to them for the duration of what sounds like an agonizing flight. Passengers from other US States are out of luck - at least until their legislatures also pass reasonable privacy legislation.</p><p>Other airlines are removing seat-back entertainment to reduce fuel, so on top of the baseline climate impact of the air travel industry, there's a real additional climate implication here. Planes with seat-back entertainment, in general, use more fuel; United is making a revenue decision with all kinds of negative impacts that they should not be rewarded for.</p>

That's not a good excuse at all, but I bet that's what's going on.</p><p>This is another example of the core issue with robots.txt: it's a handshake agreement at best. There are no legal or technical restrictions imposed by it; we all just hope that bots do the right thing. Some of them do, but a lot of them don't.</p><p>The only real way to restrict these services is through legal rules that create meaningful consequences for these companies. Until then, there will be no sure-fire way to prevent your content from being accessed by an AI agent.</p>

<p>Rosemary’s take on Shortcuts gives me confidence to try them out again - because for me - life is too short to deal with a string of ‘ifs’ and other rules shortcomings. Sounds like that might be fixed?</p>
<p>David commenting that Shortcuts was ‘short changed’ on updates on this round - wondering if that is because Apple Intelligence - from a customer experience POV might be a better way to do something things that previously only Shortcuts could do? Not there yet - but maybe they will get to that when they get to the Apple Intelligence section.</p>

Yet another example of the same vulnerability we see time and time again.<p></p>
<p>If you build an LLM-based chat interface that gets exposed to both private and untrusted data (in this case the code in VS Code that Copilot Chat can see) and your chat interface supports Markdown images, you have a data exfiltration prompt injection vulnerability.</p>
<p>The fix, applied by GitHub here, is to disable Markdown image references to untrusted domains. That way an attack can't trick your chatbot into embedding an image that leaks private data in the URL.</p>

<p>動画やWebページの調べ物を良くする人は<a href="https://app.otio.ai//?ref=nat">Otio AI</a>を使ったほうが良い。効率がめちゃくちゃ良くなる。逆にたまにしかページを読み込んだりしっかり動画をみたりしないという人も使った方が良い。なれない自分がやるよりも10倍しっかりポイントを掴んで教えてくれる。</p>



 Otio AIとは 



<p>Otio AIとは、指定した資料の中に調査する内容を限定して調べ物をすることに特化したAIだ。WebページやYoutube動画のURLを貼って概要を把握、追加質問をしていく形でさらに掘っていくことができる。日本語のYouTubeの動画を1/10の時間でまとめてくれたのには感動したし<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2024/06/5837/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-5837" title="ファイルサイズが100MBまでなので長さ的には15分位が限界のようだが…。">1</a>、OpenID for VCI のまとめを作って、それに追加質問して内容を識っていったりするのもハードルがすごく低い。調査の内容を、指示したソースだけに限定できるのは、結果の信頼度を上げるのに結構大きい。ただし、今のところ実質的にPCやMacからでスマホからは使えない。その点は、PDFに関してになるけれども<a href="https://popai.pro/">PopAI</a>の方が良い。アプリ版があるので。（その他にも、プレゼンを作ったりなどの機能が色々あって、Otio AIとはまた別の使い道があるので、それらはまた別途記事にする。）</p>



<p>無料版は月15件までの質問と制限がつよいけれども機能を試してみるのには良いし、たまにYouTube動画のまとめを手っ取り早くみたいとか、ページやPDFの概要を知りたいという方には良いと思う。一方、わたしのように際限なく使いそうなタイプにはMax版が良いだろう。</p>



<p>Max版は </p>



 
 GPT-4o, Claude, Llama3, Mistral 対応  



 URL, PDF, YouTube, 音声ファイル, CSV (ファイルは100MBまで)  



 AIチャット/まとめ/エディタ  



 自動引用とリファレンス  



 Perplexity のモデルを使った調査（ただしPro機能は無い） 
 



<p>とかなり機能強々。わたしは、早速年間割引でmax版を買ってしまった。</p>



<p>というわけで、どんな感じかちょっとちら見せ。</p>



 日本語のYoutube動画をまとめてみる 



<p>まずは日本語のYouTubeを読み込ませてみよう。今回読み込ませたのはYouTubeのおすすめに出てきた「<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTrl9lmSDnY">もらわないとマジでもったいない最強補助金</a>」という動画。まじでもったいないらしいので見なければと思うけれども15分も見ていられないなぁというときにOtioが役に立つ！</p>



<p>Otioの画面を開くと、「Import file or link」というボタンがあるのでそれを押して「 Paste Link」を選択、テキストボックスに読み込ませたいYouTube動画のURLを貼り付けて「Add」ボタンを押す。</p>



<p>ここで複数指定することもできるようだが、ここではそのまま「Save」を押して先に進もう。すると、読み込みが行われる。1〜２分待って読み込みが終わったら、下に動画のサムネのタイルが出てくるのでそれをクリック。すると、YouTubeを読み込んだ画面が出てくるので、その右上の「Summary」ボタンを押すと、動画の内容がテキストで出てくる。これなら10分の動画の概要が1分でわかる。</p>



<p>（当該動画をまとめた例）</p>

（出所）<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTrl9lmSDnY">「この制度を使わない企業は格差がつきます…！」</a></blockquote>



<p>なんか「販促」が「反則」になっていたりするけど、それは御愛嬌。逆に音声から取っているんだなというのがわかるところでもあります。これで十分意味がわかる。社外取締役をやっている先の<a href="https://www.authlete.com/">Authlete社</a>でも、旅費、資料購入費、委託外注費などは使えそう。一応中小企業の定義も調べておこう。これは、右のChat欄に入力して聞くと、この動画を資料として答えてくれる。</p>



<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.sakimura.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-3.png?ssl=1"></a>



<p>うーん、行けるような気もするが…。</p>



<p>なお、この動画はちょっと前の動画で、第15回小規模事業者持続化補助金についてのものだったので、申込期限は3月14日ととっくにすぎていた。<a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/">Perplexity</a>によると、現在は第17回をやっているらしい。</p>



第17回小規模事業者持続化補助金の締切は、2024年8月29日です[3]。<br>Citations:<br>[3] https://leon-strategy.com/jizokuka_305（出所）<a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/search/SFsph1hVTBaXfEMVLzjQNQ#1">https://www.perplexity.ai/search/SFsph1hVTBaXfEMVLzjQNQ#1</a>



<p>OtiaにもPerplexityのモデルを使ったWeb検索機能もあるのだが、まだ試験バージョンで、Perplexity.AI自体に比べるとちょっと見劣りする。わたしがPerplexityの有料版を使っているので尚更かも知れない。</p>



 日本語のスライドPDFを読み込ませてみる 



<p>次に、日本語のスライドを読みこませてみよう。素材として使ったのは、個人情報保護委員会事務局の令和6年4月24日のスライド<a href="https://www.ppc.go.jp/files/pdf/240424_shiryou-2.pdf">「個人情報保護法 いわゆる３年ごと見直し規定に基づく検討（個人の権利利益のより実質的な保護の在り方③）」</a>。これもYouTube動画のときと同じようにURL指定して読み込む。「Summary」を見ると<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2024/04/5853/">リンク先</a>のようになる。</p>



  
<p><a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2024/04/5853/">要約を見るにはクリック</a></p>
  



<p>あとは動画のときと同じように、Chatでこの文書についていろいろ質問して確かめていくことなどができる。今回はPDFを一つだけだが、例えば一連のファイルを全部読み込ませてそれに質問していくようにすると結構良さそうな感じだ。</p>



 HTMLページを読み込ませてみる 



<p>最後にHTMLページを読み込ませてみよう。これには、「<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html">OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance – draft 13</a>」やらせてみた。すると、変数のフォーマットなども含めて割と良い感じに<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/ai-summary-of-openid-for-verifiable-credential-issuance-draft-13-by-otio-ai/">英語でSummary</a>が出てくる。英語のSummary〜しかもかなり長く詳細なのをこの日本語のポストに書いてもあれなので、<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/ai-summary-of-openid-for-verifiable-credential-issuance-draft-13-by-otio-ai/">リンク</a>だけ張っておくが、かなり良い感じだ。</p>



  
<p><a href="https://www.sakimura.org/ai-summary-of-openid-for-verifiable-credential-issuance-draft-13-by-otio-ai/">英文要約を見るにはクリック</a></p>
  



 まとめ 



<p>今回は各カテゴリー一つづつの素材を使ってやってみたが、複数の素材を指定してやるとより効果が上がりそうだ。より使い込んでみたらまたレポートしたいと思う。なにしろ、指定したソースだけに回答の内容が依拠するというのはとても使い勝手が良い。ハルシネーションが大幅に減ることが期待される。これは、GoogleのNotebookLMも同じだが、Youtubeの動画をソースに指定できたりするところなどはOtiaに軍配が上がると思う。（早晩追いつくのだろうが。）</p>



<p>そうそう、不満点もなくはない。</p>



 
 やはり、Perplexityなどもそうだが、日本語の入力で確定をするとchatが投入されてしまう不具合がある。 



 また、英語のSummaryをそのまま日本語にする方法もわからない。 



 さらに、ここが最大かも知れないが、モバイルから使えない！ 



 指定できるファイルが100MBに限られる。動画だと10分〜15分くらい。これは現在のモデルがGPT-4oだということなどにも関連していそう。Gemini 1.5 Pro とかが使えるようになると改善するかも知れない。 
 



<p>それでも、かなり使い勝手があることは間違いない。</p>



<p>しかし、課金しているAIツールが増えてきたな。すこし整理しないと…。</p>

      I know he died ‘young’ at ’42’ (now THERE’s a reference), somehow I forget really just how young he was, given his impact on culture. That said, for me, never a great fan. Appreciate who he was, what he did .. but maybe just too young to be a real fan and maybe my musical interests are different.  This all to explain why it might have taken me this long to get round to watching the Elvis biopic

<p>🎈167/366</p>
<p>I kid you not, so frustrated earlier today that I have had to calm down. All my iOS stuff not currently in use is kept in a single place. Yesterday the pile was - shall we say - ‘organised’. All stuff in same place - just a neater pile than usual.</p>
<p>Today, I went to pick up iPad and 🍎Pencil - and the pencil was missing. Nowhere. Seperated all devices out - and checked off one by one. Still nothing. I went to the places I usually use it - nada. Lifted couch cushions. Nothing. Stopped search. Started search. Frustration doesn’t even get to it. Two hours and then some. Negotiating with myself - that clearly it was a message from above that my old pencil had run its course - and I could now justify a super duper new one.</p>
<p>Here’s what I think happened.</p>
<p>The bank manager got hold of that rationale and somehow planted in my brain that I should take one more look. I did.</p>
<p>Did I mention the tray that sits beside the ‘iOS stuff’? I mean it’s there. It’s clearly not hiding - and I had looked under and all around it. The lip of the tray curves down so you can’t see anything behind the lip if you look ‘underneath from the side’. But I knew that and had already looked. I mean - how could anything really be there? It would just fall down again.</p>
<p>TODAY I LEARNED …</p>
<p>.. that the tray has sufficient Nickel plating that it can attract a magnet in say something like an Apple Pencil and snap that puppy nice and tight into and under that lip.</p>
<p>😬</p>

<p>It turns out this is one of those blog posts that ended up being more working notes for myself than a coherent narrative for others. So be it. I needed to write down these random, but somewhat related musings and observations for future reference. At some point maybe I’ll be able to synthesize all the loose bits flying around, but today is not that day.&nbsp;If you care to look over my shoulder and get a glimpse into my explorations in and around Little Rock and Hot Springs, in the context of collective intelligence, fungi, and fluid dynamics, you’re more than welcome to do that!</p>
<p>I came across the quote below from Itzhak Bentov’s “Stalking the Wild Pendulum” this morning, and it very much resonated. While part of me wonders if the connections I’m making across disparate pools of information are valid, there’s another part – my intuitive gut sense – that tells me to keep going. In prior posts I’ve laid out how the environment seems to “speak” to me in objects and experiences. There are lessons I’m supposed to learn, but the takeaways are not always immediately obvious.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“As consciousness evolves and information starts pouring in, the information is couched in a language best understandable to the person involved. For instance, a poet will be shown the nature of Creation in poetic images, an artist in visual symbols, and a mathematician in abstract equations; a nuts-and-bolts fellow like myself will have it shown to him as structure.”</p>

<p>So, if I take that to heart, I suppose it’s not surprising that messages would come to me through the cultural landscape – art, buildings, nature. Sometimes clues are slippery, or I don’t yet have enough context to understand their significance. My pin board is getting pretty full, but I keep shoving stuff in. At the end of a walk I made through the Vogel Schwartz Sculpture Garden along the Arkansas River last Saturday, I saw this lovely woman dancing on a circle.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>As I navigate the deluge of information around me, I aspire to lean-into her grace and poise balancing on the circuit. Hopefully I can learn to traverse the Mobius strip of Bentov’s cycles of continuously inverted realities in the spirit of joyful exhilaration shown by these children parading across a log. Like the little girl at the front, I step off into my next adventure, not all of them as immense as buying a house. Sometimes the adventure is just trying out a new recipe, cumin-cinnamon farmer’s market okra, sauteed with onions in a borrowed kitchen.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In the past two weeks, I’ve had two unsuccessful attempts to purchase a new home. Both situations had to do with water, which is interesting. For the past several years Stephers and I have been turning over this “water problem” and how it relates to graphene, carbon nanotubes, flow state, microfluidics, and dissonant forms of oscillation that seem to have resulted in countless broken relationships. It is this systematic, perhaps bioengineered, tearing of the global social fabric (social physics) that has created an abundance of disconnected “free agents” available for game play in this surreal, yet long anticipated. human potential movement optimization landscape. </p>
<p>Then our friend Sean brought in more wrinkles around Alphabet’s wastewater scans and Jepson’s precision AI health advisories that meshed with my research into social impact bonds around sanitation and Stanford’s “smart” toilets. Not to mention Ivan Illich’s strange sewage talk given to the Dallas Humanities Institute at the invitation of Gail Thomas, who along with Jungian soul alchemist James Hillman was aiming to “heal” her city from the long held trauma of the Kennedy Assasination. You can almost imagine her teaming up with Nicole Shanahan to get Texans logged on to their digital blockchain freeDOM wallets and have Metroplex-based Verily optimize their microbiomes as free-market agents in some strange, possibly interdimensional, economic transaction we haven’t yet grocked.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;Along the sculpture walk there was a small memorial plaque to an Arkansas electronica dance pioneer, Jeffrey “Bushy” (yes, another plant reference) Hudnall, founder of Cybertribe and pioneer of the music scene in Little Rock. Bushy was beloved for nurturing community. “Luv” was a theme in his memorials. So, I’ve never encountered a public memorial to an electronica figure, and since Jamie Wheal speaks of the medium as a way to access ecstatic flow states, it seems important. Oh, and the wall in the park was about a fifteen-minute walk from the Albert Pike Memorial Temple. </p>

<p>So I ended up reaching out to Emily Moyer, since she is the person I know who is most expert in this area. I mentioned to her our recent investigations into tardigrade biology, including the water bears’ intrinsically disordered proteins, as a possible system of networked data storage that could link water programming and group mind. After I rang off I realized the bench where I’d been sitting, which had a view of the Arkansas River that runs from the Colorado Rockies through the plains and on to the Mississippi Delta, was framed by an oval sculpture that was pretty much a picture window composed of hexagons that evoked, for me at least, graphene membranes for water “cleansing” and perhaps programming. As Emily said, Hesse’s Glass Bead Game is always on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first failed home purchase involved a one-acre property with lovely frog filled marsh along the road, which I was super excited about. Unfortunately, the fact that it extended into an antiquated septic field made the deal a no-go. My second attempt was a cute house near the racetrack, a Cuban-themed coffee shop, and the bike trail downtown. The inspection was going great until the guy tried to get into the crawl space to take at the guts of the house and much of the ground was covered by an inch of water on top of an ill-fitting vapor barrier. Add to that a lot of soggy, ripped up duct insulation, and that was not going to work either. The water table around there is really high and I could end up spending a ton of money trying to mitigate the situation and still end up with mother nature laughing at my feeble attempts to contain her.</p>
<p>I’d been making arrangements for movers and insurance and utilities, and that all was brought to an abrupt halt. Back to square one. I was frustrated and decided to take a hike to clear my head. We’ve had lots of electrical storms and torrential downpours in Central Arkansas this May. On the positive side, my things in storage have stayed dry so far, everything is a lush deep green, and the fungi are blissed out in all their diverse mycelial glory. I’ll share the photos of the amazing mushrooms that gave me quite a show along my walk in another post (<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2024/06/14/monism-microbiomes-fungi-emergent-pre-k/">here</a>).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Years ago I remember reading Barbara Kingsolver’s memoir “Animal, Vegetable, Miracle” about her family’s move across the country from arid Arizona to the mountains of Virginia where her husband’s family had land, and there was water. She felt like life in Arizona was no longer sustainable due to drought conditions. Water was, in part, what brought me to Arkansas. I loved the idea of clear mountain lakes fed by creeks burbling over quartz crystal spread across hundreds of thousands of acres of National Forest. I was excited by the idea of mineral springs with public taps downtown where anyone can fill a jug for free. It was great to imagine living in a place where it rains enough that you don’t have to water your garden every day.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I guess I just hadn’t thought through what all that moisture would mean for the spore-like creatures with whom we share our planet and who perhaps would also like to be my toxic below-the-floorboards or behind-the-drywall “roommates.” It’s a tricky course to navigate as a home buyer in a land of humidity and standing water. I’m looking at a property now that has a partial basement and a sloped yard that’s graded away from the house. I guess you know you’re all grown up when dry basements and French drains are something to be excited about.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The efficiency apartment where I’m staying looks out over a brick walled garden with a large fountain. Under a broad basin are four draped female figures, which I presume are meant to represent the four seasons, the water pouring over the basin squirts out from a large jug ornamented with four horned Satyr heads. I presume this signifies Pan, son of Hermes and a close friend of Dionysus. Pan was god of flocks, shepherds, and bees who oversaw the wild lands and springs of Arcadia. He was worshiped not in fancy temples, but in caves and grottoes, which seems appropriate for Arkansas. He played pipes and danced, but could also cause dread and PANic among travelers through the forest.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In trying to find out more about Pan, I came across a reference to a book about conversations Scottmsan Robert Ogilvie Crombie had with Pan and other forest elementals in the 1970s. Crombie was close friends with Peter and Eileen Caddy who created the Findhorn Foundation in the 1960s, one of the first intentional eco-communities. I bought a book written by a man he mentored and Ogilvie sounds rather charming. I’m a bit envious of his life chatting up gnomes in the garden. He did mention that if you want to partner with the elementals you should leave a corner of your plot wild and untended and go there as little as possible. I shall keep that in mind as I draw up my garden plans.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Last Saturday I explored Mount Holly Cemetery, where the who’s who of Arkansas are buried including many statesmen and civic leaders. It’s situated halfway between where I’m staying in Quapaw Quarter and downtown Little Rock. Along the way I took pictures of some fabulous cottage gardens, giving me ideas of things I can try when I get my own patch of soil. Be sure to notice the hunk of crystal in the birdbath and the piece in a chipped off patch of concrete sidewalk. There seems to be an added sparkly resonance to all aspects of life here in the Natural State.</p>

<p></p>
<p>I do love historic cemeteries, and I spent several hours walking Mount Holly’s old carriage lanes dotted with quartz under shady oaks and magnolias playing eye-spy with myself looking for Masonic double-headed eagles, Odd Fellow triple chains, and Woodsmen of the World stumps, along with more rare occasional pentagram and crescent moon. The grounds are well-tended by the local Master Gardener group and there’s a restored Victorian Iron Fountain near the back that adds a soothing, splashing sound to mask the hum of cars on the nearby expressway that lies beyond the quaint Sexton’s cottage.</p>

<p>One of the headstones, made for a man named Reasoner, was inscribed with Psalms 65 Verse 9. “The River of God Is Full of Water,” a complement to Revelations 22 Verse 1 “And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.” Water, sacred water, yes but preferably water in the right place.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>There was also an inscription on a memorial obelisk to William Gilchrist, the first Grand Master Mason of the Grand Lodge of Arkansas, which was established in 1838. “What is our life, it is even a vapour that apeareth for a time and then vanesheth away.” Vapour, another phase of water that feels apt for this Aquarian age where the air sign (ether / Ethereum) bears the shared cup (or well) of knowledge to bestow upon the collective, shared information ruled by Uranus (innovation and unconventional thinking)&nbsp; and Saturn (logic and structure).&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>To me this brings to mind Alicia Juarerro’s enabling constraints in an emergent complex system, perhaps one where we’re tagged, according to our assigned&nbsp; archetype, and given a ticket to enter the World Sensorium dance hall of qualitative information transmission, an experience especially designed for the cosmic free agent cadre. I’ve read that Aquarius has a glyph of two parallel waveforms, ripples that speak to this dual nature, communication above and below, Earthly and divine. Ripple, like Matthew Mellon’s XRP, a current/currency to draw us into a cybernetic flow state for unconscious collective problem solving perhaps?</p>

<p>And the Woodmen of the World? That pricked up my ears after having put together a three-hour compilation of clips that hopefully draw connections between token engineering and collective intelligence based on information exchanges enacted between fungi and root systems. Sep Kavar, of MIT Social Computing, IoT pre-k slippers and beautiful digital money for refugees, often speaks of the intelligence of the forest. </p>

<p>It turns out the Woodmen of the World (WoW), whose members often featured the fraternal order’s insignia and arboreal designs on their “tree-stump tombstones,” was founded in 1890 in Omaha, Nebraska – later home to Warren Buffett and the Berkshire Hathaway juggernaut – by <a href="https://srjarchives.tripod.com/1998-09/UZZEL.HTM">Joseph Cullen Root</a> (root, right?), a 33-degree mason who was involved in various business enterprises throughout the midwest.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The privately-held life insurance firm currently manages $17 billion in assets and has over 1,000 employees. The 2002 Jack Nicholson comedy “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/About_Schmidt">About Schmidt</a>” centers on his character’s retirement as an actuarial executive from Woodmen of the world. The organization makes $18 million in philanthropic donations annually. Members participated in parades dressed in military-style uniforms bearing aluminum axes. Up until the Depression, the fraternal order trained drill teams, called Foresters, at huge summer encampments. Members were sought out to be made officers during WWI due to this training.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In doing a search on the WoW aluminum axes, I came across mention of an Aesop fable, “Mercury and the Woodsman.” In the story a poor woodsman loses his ax in a stream. Loudly bemoaning his fate, the winged god comes down to help, but when retrieving the ax Mercury tempts the man first with a gold ax and later with a silver ax, both of which the man refuses. For his honesty, Mercury gives the woodman all three axes to keep. I find the confluence of woodsman, aluminum, and mercury rather interesting given my research into ALCOA and the Mellons and soul alchemy. I guess I’ll just have to put a pin in that.</p>

<p>A timeline on the Woodmen of the World website notes the role that one of their members, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_Sheppard">Morris Sheppard</a>, played in setting up Federal Credit Unions. When I was first researching blockchain identity in 2018, I was surprised to see early efforts were being led by credit unions, though now within the context of a networked collective (as with cooperatives) this makes sense.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sheppard was a lawyer turned Texas Legislator and later US Senator who was a eugenicist who was allied with the Kellogg’s Race Betterment and temperance advocate. Despite authoring the federation legislation that established&nbsp; Prohibition he managed to run a productive still operation from his Texas ranch.&nbsp; He promoted women’s suffrage and the provision of federal funds for pregnant women to reduce infant mortality; however, in 1914 he was on the Central Committee planning the First National Conference on Race Betterment held at the Battle Creek Michigan Sanitarium.</p>

<p>It turns out the man who reinvigorated the Ku Klux Klan was also a Woodman of the World member. In the 1920s in Texas practically all elected officials, lawyers, and judges in the state of Texas were, too. Which meant that in order to try a legal dispute around a Woodmen of the World property in El Paso, the state had to create an all-female judiciary at the state supreme court level, because all the men had to recuse themselves from the case. Those are things that make you go, um, when considering the role of eugenics, digital health records, guided evolution, blockchain, and public-private partnerships being set up in the Lone Star State.</p>

<p>I see a compelling overlap with the outsize role fungi-heavy Pacific Northwest institutions and companies have played over the past thirty years in bioengineering, gaming, ingenious data storage systems, etc. to get the next layer of the Maya AR spectacle prepared. Early in my education activism days, I flagged Booth Gardener, former Governor of Washington, as an important player. His stepfather was former board chair of Weyerhaeuser. Booth was also on the company’s board. Former Arkansas native Bill Clinton tapped him to serve as US Trade Representative and Gardener was later pulled into the sphere of Marc Tucker and NCEE who were intent on reimagining schools with backing from the US Chamber of Commerce and the National Governors (read Kubernetes) Association. See the LittleSis Screen shots below for a glimpse into the range of social welfare policies Gardner (interesting name there) implemented, including assisted suicide, which I can see playing into the future of sustainable human composting being let by Washington State with pilots at Bells Mountain, a research focus of my friend Sean. In case you were wondering, there are lots of videos showing Tardigrades in compost.</p>
<p>Check out<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2024/06/14/monism-microbiomes-fungi-emergent-pre-k/"> this post</a> for a two-part, four-hour conversation Sean and I had on microbial intelligence, fungi, permaculture, indigenous wisdom, and the future of computing.</p>
<p>PS: I am working on a post with an updated working hypothesis about the nature of “the system” we’re in. I took lots of notes today and hope to have that one up early next week. Stay tuned!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Is this an age where life on Earth is further knit together by an emerging “technology,” that looks more squishy and organic than sharp and metallic? Fewer screens and more precision probiotics? Less 5g and more tuned light? Mechanical data centers swapped for bioengineered creatures and microbial colonies? A world where computation is managed in vivo, and wastewater scans optimize our potential as contributing nodes in a vast biological network. Sort of adds a whole new level of meaning to the culture war use of “colonizer,” when what is being colonized is perhaps your colon, and you get rewarded for productive excretion. Gross, yes I know, but as we seem venture capital (Bobby’s Vantage Partners included frame out the Cleantech space adjacent to AI and machine learning) we should know what game we’re playing or as my friend Sean says what song we’re singing, eh?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’ve been thinking a lot lately about water as a programmable medium (by changing the position of the hydrogen atoms in relation to the oxygen) and information theory. I followed closely the efforts to protect the Mni Sose by water protectors at Standing Rock. “Water is life” and perhaps water is information from the sacred source of creation that connects us all. I spent six weeks along the banks of the Moreau River in the summer of 2020, a sojourn that culminated on the banks of that nourishing river, subjected to the exploits of the Army Corps’ Pick Sloan dam projects. What does it mean that their logo is a castle? Something about French-inspired fortification taught at West Point, but I’m not sure that’s all there is to that story.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I noted in my previous post, it could be that the next “sustainable” quantum computer is a damp moss and lichen covered boulder glazed in engineered rain coating microscopic tardigrades that have been transformed to hold our digitally twinned minds as a unified energetic field. Here is a two-part discussion my friend Sean and I had unpacking an ongoing text thread we’ve been cultivating with Stephers. Also, some pictures for you to enjoy of the diverse fungi, elemental denizens the forests around Lake Ouachita. </p>
<p>They are spectacularly networked!</p>

Generative AI is a technical accomplishment, for sure, but it is not a humanist accomplishment. There are no shortcuts to the human experience. And wanting a shortcut to human experience in itself devalues being human.</p>

  Nobody’s talking about this, so I will: Jayson Tatum is playing a decoy. More to the point, he is playing Jokić, Dončić, or a bit of both.

This is the best illustration I could get out of ChatGPT 4o. It’ll do until I have it get a better one.
<p>Nobody’s talking about this, so I will: Jayson Tatum is playing a decoy. More to the point, he is playing Jokić, Dončić, or a bit of both. Not all the time (such as when he’s doing one of those step-back threes with lots of time on the clock, but enough). So let’s call him Jayson Tatić.</p>
<p>Because on offense he’s pulling in double and triple teams and passing expertly to open men. Over and over again. And the passes turn into assists because he is connected to those men. That’s the way the Boston Celtićs work under Joe Mazzula. Connection is everything. They are a team of fully capable all-stars, each willing to give up their own ego and stats for the sake of the team.</p>
<p>So, while the talking heads and talking ‘casts go on about how poor Tatum’s offense seems to be, they miss the misdirection. They assume Jayson Tatum is always wanting to play hero ball, because he can, and because that’s they guy he is. They don’t get that he’s really Jayson Tatić’, and his feint is that he’s always going to shoot, that he’s always going to post up and go one-on-two or one-on-few. Meanwhile, what he’s really doing is pulling in a defense that gives him open men, all of whom he knows, because he’s connected to them psychically, audibly (they talk!) and manually. He is always working to pass, which he does expertly.</p>
<p>Yeah, he turns it over sometimes. So what. He gets assists because he’s a one-man wrecking crew of misdirection, especially when he gets downhill. And the man can pass.</p>
<p>When this series is over, and Boston takes it 4 to 3, 2, 1, or 0, and Jaylen Brown or Jrue Holiday get the MVP (like Andre Iguodala got the MVP a few years back), the Celtics’ success will owe in no small way to Jayson’s teamwork.</p>
<p>There’s a game tonight, so watch for it.</p>

<p></p><p>Imagine a life where you dictate your own schedule, free from the confines of a traditional job.</p><p>That’s a thought experiment I’ve been playing with lately: what would it look like if this was my last ever job? How might I optimize my lifestyle for freedom?</p><p>By that I don’t mean that it would be the last time I needed to earn money. I work <a href="https://propublica.org">in non-profit news</a>; nobody does this because they want to become rich beyond their wildest dreams. Even tech salaries feel distant from this vantage point. To be clear, I’m doing this work because it’s important, and I have no plans to leave.</p><p>Regardless, I think it’s an important thought experiment. What if this was the last time I worked a job with regular hours and a boss and a hierarchy? What would it look like to have a lifestyle that was less bound to working norms, so that I could choose how to spend my day, or my week, or my year?</p><p>This desire to seek a lifestyle less bound by traditional working norms is shaped by two big influences:</p>  My working life in startups, which was very much self-driven 
 My own parents, who had their own publishing startup for a key part of my childhood. 
 <p>My parents’ ability to dictate their schedules and norms meant that I was able to have childhood experiences — in particular, trips to mainland Europe and the US — that would have been much harder otherwise. (These things didn’t need all that much money; they needed time.) That lifestyle did something else important, too: it showed me that it was attainable, and that a person doesn’t need a 9-5 to live. That perspective, in turn, allowed me to become a founder and build new things.</p><p>I would like to do the same for our son. Honestly, selfishly, I would also like to do it for me.</p><p>What are the roads to more independence when you aren’t independently wealthy?</p><p>Here are some options I’ve considered:</p> Startups <p>The first potential path to independence is through entrepreneurship.</p><p>I’ve founded two startups in my life. The first one was bootstrapped for the first couple of years before raising a round from British investors; the second was kicked off with a small amount ($50K) of accelerator seed money.</p><p>My life has changed since then. In particular, my capital needs have shot up. There’s a child and daycare and a mortgage in the picture, which is radically different from my life as a twenty-something prepared to live on Pot Noodles and scrape by with little money. A working life of open source, mission-driven startups, and non-profit news means that my savings are meager and wouldn’t support a new venture. A friends and family round is out of the question for me, as it is for anyone who doesn’t come from wealth.</p><p>Building a startup means working hard on it while holding down my day job, until it reaches the point where it has enough traction to raise a seed round. The barrier for that traction is rising steadily; it probably needs to be making tens of thousands of dollars a month for a seed investor to find it interesting. Still, that isn’t insurmountable — particularly with a co-founder. I have more product, engineering, and organizational growth skills than ever before, and I believe that I could do it.</p><p>But also: at the point where it’s making tens of thousands of dollars a month, assuming a low running cost, that’s more than enough to sustain me! It doesn’t need to be a high-growth startup. It could be a small business that is content to do quite well. <a href="https://www.zebrasunite.org/">A Zebra, perhaps.</a> The disadvantage is that the upside is limited: it’s unlikely to make me wealthy beyond my wildest dreams. But what if that isn’t the goal? If the goal is freedom, a modest income is wonderful.</p> Consulting or Coaching <p>I have coaching training, and I’ve previously coached founders across a portfolio of mission-driven startups. In many ways, my roles as a CTO / Head of Engineering / Director of Technology have been largely coaching-based too: effective 1:1s and frameworks for feedback are the lifeblood of building a team.</p><p>I’ve also got strong product design and design thinking training, and have run workshops and design sprints with many teams. I understand product fundamentals, how to instill product thinking in a team, and can shepherd a product (and product team) from insight to launch.</p><p>And I’m technical. I can architect software and write code; I can advise teams about how to think about new technologies like AI, or how to build their own software. I’ve done this in many different contexts, many, many times.</p><p>So I think I can offer a lot. The challenge with consulting of any kind, though, is that it’s essentially a freelance job: you’re working from contract to contract, or from session to session, which means that you’re constantly having to sell yourself for the next thing, at least until your reputation has reached the point where people are asking for you.</p><p>Perhaps a retainer model would work: enough people subscribing to receive your attention and you have a steady income. Too many, though, and you can’t support them all. Too few, and you need to be in sales mode all the time. Still, it seems attractive from the provider end; the question, of course, is whether any customers would actually go for that. My guess is probably not — at least until you have enough glowing referrals.</p> Selling Products <p>In a way, this seems like the most attractive option: sell a finite product that doesn’t require your direct involvement, so that you can spend your time building the next product to sell, until you have a portfolio of products that sell without you and generate a reasonable income.</p><p>There are plenty of influencers who peddle “passive income”. My strong belief is that they’re all scammers, and that the dream of financial independence is what they’re all actually selling. Still, there are clearly people who sell things on the internet, and some of them do quite well.</p><p>These include:</p>  Books: Yay for books! Of course, the idea that you’ll make an income from books alone is a pipe dream. Even bestselling published authors often don’t leave their jobs until they’ve had a few successes in a row. There are more books being published and it’s harder to break out. Full disclosure: I am writing a book! But I don’t expect it to cover my costs. I’m doing it because there’s a story I want to tell. (And then I’ll do it again, because there are more stories to tell.) 
 Courses: Do people really make a lot of money from these? I mean, maybe. It feels like courses mostly fall into the same category as books: something you do because you want to share some knowledge or potentially demonstrate some expertise, but not something you do as a money-making venture in its own right. 
 Apps: Hmm. This was a great idea in 2008. Some software really does support independent developers, though — but my suspicion is that the software that does the best are actually services, which fit better into my “startup / small business” description above. 
  A Portfolio <p>I think this is the real answer: it isn’t just one thing. Likely, a repeatable income is cobbled together from threads of at least some of the above elements: building a service, offering coaching or consulting, and selling individual products.</p><p>One danger here is that attention is spread too thinly: because multiple threads are required, you necessarily have less time to spend on each. Consequently, the quality of each element may suffer.</p><p>This approach no longer puts all eggs in one basket, which means there’s (in theory) more tolerance for one thread to fail. But it also means that you’re spinning plates in order to try and keep them all working. Because there’s less time for each, and attention is split, there’s a real chance of all of them failing.</p><p>Still, overall, it feels like the most resilient approach, with the most room for experimentation. It’s by no means the least work, but minimizing work isn’t the goal: that would be maximizing freedom, which isn’t the same thing.</p><p>What do you think? Have you made this leap? Did it work for you? I’d love to learn more.</p>

 [Janet Vertesi at Public Books]   "Our lives are consumed with the consumption of content, but we no longer know the truth when we see it.

Books were not infallible; the stamp of a traditional publisher was not a sign that the information was correct or trustworthy. The web allowed more diverse voices to be heard. It allowed more people to share information. It was good.</p><p>The flood of automated content means that this is no longer the case. Our search engines can't be trusted; YouTube is certainly full of the worst automated dreck. I propose that we reclaim the phrase pink slime to encompass this nonsense: stuff that's been generated by a computer at scale in order to get attention.</p><p>So, yeah, I totally sympathize with the urge to buy a real-world encyclopedia again. Projects like Wikipedia must be preserved at all costs. But we have to consider if all this will result in the effective end of a web where humans publish and share information. And if that's the case, what's next?</p>

<p></p><p>A few weeks ago I wrote about how&nbsp;<a href="https://werd.io/2024/dispatches-from-the-media-apocalypse">solving the challenges facing the news industry requires fundamentally changing newsroom culture</a>. While newsrooms have depended on referrals from social media and search engines to find audiences and make an impact, both of those segments are in flux, and audiences are therefore declining. The only way to succeed is to experiment and try new things — and, therefore, to have a culture where experimentation and trying new things are supported.</p><p>While the article was focused on journalism, the same changes are required for any organization to succeed in the face of rapid technological change. Building an open culture of experimentation is just as important for technology and manufacturing companies as it is for news: every organization experiences challenges in the face of major change.</p> Okay, but how? <p>Building a great culture is non-negotiable. The question, of course, is how you build it.</p><p>There are a few versions of this question to consider. For me, the most interesting are:</p>  How do you build a great culture from scratch in a new organization? 
 How do you build a great culture in an established organization that has not yet invested in building one? 
 How do you build a great culture in an established organization that has an entrenched bad culture? 
 <p>Of course, to consider this, you have to have a firm opinion of what constitutes a good or bad culture. I strongly believe it relates to building an open, nurturing culture of experimentation, which I have <a href="https://werd.io/2024/building-engineering">previously written about in depth</a>:</p><blockquote><p>The best teams have a robust, intentional culture that champions openness, inclusivity, and continuous learning — which requires a lot of relationship-building both internally and with the organization in which it sits. These teams can make progress on meaningful work, and make their members valued, heard, and empowered to contribute.</p></blockquote> One indicator <p>I believe the litmus test of such cultures is inclusivity.</p><p>Consider this hypothetical scenario: the individual contributors in an organization complain to management that underrepresented members of the team are not able to be heard in meetings and that their ideas are always overlooked.</p><p>The managers could react in a few different ways:</p>  Dismiss the complaints outright. 
 Try to make the complaints go away as quickly as possible so everyone can get back to work. 
 Listen deeply to the complaints and to the people affected, then work with the whole organization to get real training and build better processes in order to ensure everyone can participate and is heard. 
 <p>Only the third option represents an open, inclusive organization. The first is obviously dismissive; the second is arguably even worse, as it allows managers to delude themselves that they’re doing something while actively trying to do the bare minimum. (They might privately roll their eyes at having to do it to begin with.) In the third scenario, managers stop and listen to the people affected and work with them in order to effect real change.</p><p>Now consider: what happens if nobody brings that complaint to begin with?</p><p>In a truly inclusive organization, nobody has to bring that complaint, because managers are constantly assessing the well-being of their teams, and likely receiving continuous, honest feedback. This doesn’t happen by default: the culture of the organization has to be well-considered to ensure that a focus on inclusivity is a cherished value, and that everyone feels emotionally safe to contribute without needing to put on a work persona or mask away aspects of their identities.</p><p>This has certain prerequisites. In particular, it’s impossible for an organization with a top-down leadership style to be inclusive, by definition. Even if upper management is truly representative of the demographics and backgrounds of the wider organization and its customers (which is never true), top-down leadership misses the perspectives and ideas of people lower down the hierarchy. Gestures like “ideas boxes” are performative at best. If they wouldn’t be out of place in your organization, its culture is probably top-down.</p><p>Organizations can foster inclusivity by implementing regular feedback mechanisms, providing training on both inclusivity and management, promoting transparent communication, and establishing clear systems and boundaries which allow managers to say “yes” more often.</p><p>The received wisdom is that rules are barriers to innovation. But it turns out that establishing the right kind of structure helps innovation thrive.</p> The tyranny of structurelessness <p>News often does have a top-down culture, inherited from the editorial cultures of old-school newspapers. It’s not alone: finance, law, and many other legacy industries also suffer from this problem. This is a giant headwind for any kind of real innovation, because every new idea essentially has to achieve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_assent">royal assent</a>. There’s no leeway for experimentation, trying stuff, or getting things wrong — and managers are more likely to take credit for any successes. If something doesn’t fit into the manager’s worldview, the “no”s come freely. But, of course, that worldview is derived from their own experiences, backgrounds, and contexts, rather than the lived experiences of other people.</p><p>Structureless organizations, where culture has been under-invested in, tend to have these characteristics. If it’s not the managers dictating what happens, it’s the loudest people in the room, who tend to be the people who come from relative privilege. Without structure to ensure inclusivity, inevitably you’ll lose out on valuable perspectives and ideas.</p><p>It just so happens that the structures that establish inclusive practices also form the backbone of intentional cultures for everyone. It’s not just people from vulnerable communities who aren’t necessarily heard; by creating structures that intentionally lift those voices up, we lift up everybody and ensure everyone gets an equitable say.</p><p>Ensuring that all voices collaborate on the strategy of the organization and are able to define the work makes for better work, because a wider set of ideas and perspectives are considered — particularly those that managers might otherwise be blind to.</p><p>Inclusivity should never be considered a nice-to-have: in addition to being the morally correct path, it’s the key to unlocking an innovative culture that has the power to save existing industries and establish new ones. The people who roll their eyes at it are doomed to live out the status quo. Ultimately, inevitably, they will be left behind.</p>

<p>The Pulse is <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/s/the-pulse">a series</a> covering insights, patterns, and trends within Big Tech and startups. Notice an interesting event or trend? <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/contact/">Send me a message</a>.</p><p>Today, we cover:</p>  <p>Industry pulse. Microsoft will not ship Recall with glaring security holes and will fix these; Twitter forgets to collect laptop from fired employee for 1.5 years; Regions where it’s easier to raise pre-seed funding; Microsoft’s performance review cycle in progress, and more.</p>  <p>Apple demonstrates AI is best as many small features. Apple showcased dozens of generative AI-powered operating system-level improvements for coming versions of iOS, iPadOS and MacOS operating systems. It’s the most convincing demonstration yet of how GenAI powered features will be useful on smartphones, day to day.</p>  <p>A new standard in confidential computing: Apple Private Cloud Compute. Apple takes user data privacy seriously, and has launched the most secure cloud backend around. It offers to safeguard user data processed by powerful AI models running on Apple’s cloud. It’s a new bar in verifiable security.</p>  <p>Who’s to blame; ChatGPT or a dev? An early-stage startup suffered an outage which meant customers could not purchase a subscription for five days. It turned out ChatGPT generated the buggy lines of code that caused the problem. But is it fair to blame a hammer when you bang your thumb with it, or is the tool actually at fault this time?</p>   1. Industry pulse  Recall recalled <p>Last week, Microsoft faced warranted criticism for attempting to ship a highly invasive continuous screenshot-taking feature (Recall) as a default opt-in, with zero regards to basic security practices. I wrote <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/145377185/microsoft-security-fiasco-with-recall">I couldn’t see how Microsoft could ship Recall</a> without fixing these basic security gaps.</p><p>This week, Microsoft decided the same. The company will now <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/microsoft-recall-off-default-security-concerns/">switch the feature off</a> by default, encrypt data, and require authentication to access Recall’s stored data. The incident is another example of Microsoft inexplicably failing to follow basic security practices for operating system-level features. My hunch is that the tech giant did it deliberately after calculating that delivering the feature quickly for the Copilot+ PC launch was more important than building it properly. If so, it’s yet another sign that Microsoft really needs to <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-pulse-94#%C2%A7microsofts-security-focus">focus better on security basics</a>.</p> Twitter forgets to collect laptop from fired employee for 17 months

<p>Der belgische Vorsitz im Rat der EU will die Chatkontrolle am Mittwoch den 19. Juni abstimmen lassen. Damit bestätigen sich die Befürchtungen: die Verfechter der Chatkontrolle wollen ausnutzen, dass es nach den Wahlen weniger öffentliche Aufmerksamkeit gibt, während sich das Europäische Parlament erst neu bilden muss. Wenn die Chatkontrolle es jetzt durch den Rat schafft besteht außerdem die Gefahr, dass sich das Parlament in seiner neuen Zusammensetzung nicht so stark gegen die Chatkontrolle wehrt und unsere bisherigen Erfolge in den Trilogverhandlungen zwischen Rat und Parlament wieder aufgibt.</p>



<p>Darum musst du jetzt aktiv werden! Jetzt kommt es mehr denn je auf den zivilgesellschaftlichen Widerstand gegen die Chatkontrolle an. Dafür hast du viele Möglichkeiten und in diesem Beitrag erkläre ich wie. Die drei wichtigsten Schritte sind:</p>



 
 Kontaktiere deine Regierung und sag, sie soll gegen die Chatkontrolle stimmen (Kontaktdaten siehe unten) 
 



 
 Schlag online Alarm, um andere zu warnen, damit sie das jetzt nicht heimlich durchdrücken können 
 



 
 Triff mindestens eine Person offline und plant, wie ihr gemeinsam aktiv werden könnt! 
 



<p>Unten im Beitrag findest du die Timeline der nächsten Schritte.</p>



 Kontaktiere die Regierung 



<p>Jetzt ist es wichtig zu zeigen, dass die Zivilgesellschaft weiter wachsam ist. Der beste Weg dafür ist, dich direkt bei den sogenannten „ständigen Vertretungen“ zu melden, also die offizielle Vertretung deiner Regierung bei der EU.</p>



<p>Für Deutschland ist das:</p>



<p>Die Ständige Vertretung der Bundesrepublik Deutschland bei der Europäischen Union (zuständig ist <a href="https://bruessel-eu.diplo.de/eu-de/staendigevertretungeu/-/1502664">Dr. Katharina Erdmenger vom Bereich Innenpolitik 2</a>)</p>



<p>Tel: <a>+32-27871000</a> </p>



<p>Mail: <a href="mailto:info@bruessel-eu.diplo.de">info@bruessel-eu.diplo.de</a></p>



<p><a></a> Website: <a href="https://bruessel-eu.diplo.de/">https://bruessel-eu.diplo.de/</a></p>



<p>Sag deiner Regierung, dass auch die aktuelle Fassung der Chatkontrolle inakzeptabel ist und fordere sie höflich aber bestimmt dazu auf, klar Stellung dagegen zu beziehen und gegen den Vorschlag zu stimmen!</p>



<p>Fordere sie auch auf, auf einer formellen Abstimmung und auf einer Auszählung auch der Enthaltungen zu bestehen. (Manchmal wird in dem zuständigen „Ausschuss der ständigen Vertreter“ getrickst und Enthaltungen nicht abgefragt, obwohl sie nach den EU-Regeln wie ein „Nein“ zählt.)</p>



<p>Du kommst aus einem anderen Land als Deutschland? Auf der <a href="https://op.europa.eu/en/web/who-is-who/organization/-/organization/COREPER/">Webseite „EU Whoiswho“</a> findest du die Kontaktdaten der Ständigen Vertretungen aller EU-Länder.</p>



 Was passiert wann 



<p>Am <a href="https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/CM-3141-2024-INIT/de/pdf">Donnerstag, 13. Juni</a> werden die Minister*innen im Rat der EU (Konfiguration Justiz und Inneres) öffentlich über den Fortschritt zur Chatkontrolle austauschen. Wenn sich hier die vom belgischen Vorsitz erwartete Mehrheit bestätigt, <a href="https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-10666-2024-INIT/de/pdf">will der Vorsitz</a> einen neuen Text vorlegen und den Ausschuss der Ständigen Vertreter darüber abstimmen lassen. Das soll dem Leak von <a href="https://netzpolitik.org/2024/anlasslose-massenueberwachung-frankreich-wackelt-in-der-ablehnung-der-chatkontrolle/#dokument">netzpolitik.org zufolge</a> in der Sitzung am <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/de/meetings/mpo/2024/6/coreper-2-permanent-representatives-committee-(337001)/">19. Juni</a> passieren.</p>



<p>Darum müssen wir jetzt alle so schnell es geht aktiv werden und unsere Regierungen zu einem „Nein!“ zur Chatkontrolle auffordern, damit dieser Anlauf durch die Ständigen Vertreter am 19. Juni abgewehrt wird. Die Zeit drängt. Vielleicht ist das unsere letzte Chance, die Chatkontrolle zu stoppen!</p>

Russian hackers later used the weakness to breach the National Nuclear Security Administration, among others."</p></blockquote><p>This is a damning story about profit over principles: Microsoft failed to close a major security flaw that left the government (alongside other customers) vulnerable because it wanted to win their business. This directly paved the way for <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/04/16/985439655/a-worst-nightmare-cyberattack-the-untold-story-of-the-solarwinds-hack">the SolarWinds hack</a>.</p><p>This doesn't seem to have been covert or subtext at Microsoft:</p><blockquote><p>"Morowczynski told Harris that his approach could also undermine the company’s chances of getting one of the largest government computing contracts in U.S. history, which would be formally announced the next year. Internally, Nadella had made clear that Microsoft needed a piece of this multibillion-dollar deal with the Pentagon if it wanted to have a future in selling cloud services, Harris and other former employees said."</p></blockquote><p>But publicly it said something very different:</p><blockquote><p>"From the moment the hack surfaced, Microsoft insisted it was blameless. Microsoft President Brad Smith assured Congress in 2021 that “there was no vulnerability in any Microsoft product or service that was exploited” in SolarWinds."</p></blockquote><p>It will be interesting to see what the fallout of this disclosure is, and whether Microsoft and other companies might be forced behave differently in the future. This story represents business as usual, and without external pressure, it's likely that nothing will change.</p>

I tried out this Rust based search engine today and I was very impressed. 
 Tantivy is the core project - it's an open source (MIT) Rust library that implements Lucene-style full text search, with a very full set of features: BM25 ranking, faceted search, range queries, incremental indexing etc.

<p><code>tantivy-cli</code> offers a CLI wrapper around the Rust library. It's not actually as full-featured as I hoped: it's intended as more of a demo than a full exposure of the library's features. The JSON API server it runs can only be used to run simple keyword or phrase searches for example, no faceting or filtering.</p>
<p>Tantivy's performance is fantastic. I was able to index the entire contents of my link blog in a fraction of a second.</p>
<p>I found <a href="https://fulmicoton.com/posts/behold-tantivy/">this post</a> from 2017 where Tantivy creator Paul Masurel described the initial architecture of his new search side-project that he created to help him learn Rust. Paul went on to found <a href="https://quickwit.io/">Quickwit</a>, an impressive looking analytics platform that uses Tantivy as one of its core components.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/quickwit-oss/tantivy-py">Python bindings</a> for Tantivy look well maintained, wrapping the Rust library using <a href="https://github.com/PyO3/maturin">maturin</a>. Those are probably the best way for a developer like myself to really start exploring what it can do.</p>
<p>Also notable: the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40492834">Hacker News thread</a> has dozens of posts from happy Tantivy users reporting successful use on their projects.

   Optimal SQLite settings for Django 
Giovanni Collazo put the work in to figure out settings to make SQLite work well for production Django workloads. WAL mode and a busy_timeout of 5000 make sense, but the most interesting recommendation here is "transaction_mode": "IMMEDIATE" to avoid locking errors when a transaction is upgraded to a write transaction.

At first glance this project by Stephan Fitzpatrick is a cute demo of a terrible sounding idea... but then I tried it out and the results are weirdly effective. You can listen to a fake podcast version of the transformers paper, or upload your own PDF (with your own OpenAI API key) to make your own.<p></p>
<p>It's open source (Apache 2) so I had a poke around in <a href="https://github.com/knowsuchagency/pdf-to-podcast">the code</a>. It gets a lot done with a single <a href="https://github.com/knowsuchagency/pdf-to-podcast/blob/512bfbdb4fd658ad4b301336020c4ea16cb69e18/main.py">180 line Python script</a>.</p>
<p>When I'm exploring code like this I always jump straight to <a href="https://github.com/knowsuchagency/pdf-to-podcast/blob/512bfbdb4fd658ad4b301336020c4ea16cb69e18/main.py#L47-L80">the prompt</a> - it's quite long, and starts like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your task is to take the input text provided and turn it into an engaging, informative podcast dialogue. The input text may be messy or unstructured, as it could come from a variety of sources like PDFs or web pages. Don't worry about the formatting issues or any irrelevant information; your goal is to extract the key points and interesting facts that could be discussed in a podcast. [...]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I grabbed a copy of it and pasted in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/10/apple-intelligence/">my blog entry about WWDC</a>, which produced <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/edac62f6c11640abe98925cbc17f4ac3#apple-intelligence-a-deep-dive-into-the-future-of-ai">this result</a> when I ran it through Gemini Flash using <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-gemini">llm-gemini</a>:</p>
<p><code>cat prompt.txt | llm -m gemini-1.5-flash-latest</code></p>
<p>Then I piped the result through my <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Nov/7/ospeak/">ospeak</a> CLI tool for running text-to-speech with the OpenAI TTS models (after truncating to 690 tokens with <a href="https://github.com/simonw/ttok">ttok</a> because it turned out to be slightly too long for the API to handle):</p>
<p><code>llm logs --response | ttok -t 690 | ospeak -s -o wwdc-auto-podcast.mp3</code></p>
<p>And <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/wwdc-auto-podcast.mp3">here's the result</a> (3.9MB 3m14s MP3).</p>
<p>It's not as good as the PDF-to-Podcast version because Stephan has some <a href="https://github.com/knowsuchagency/pdf-to-podcast/blob/512bfbdb4fd658ad4b301336020c4ea16cb69e18/main.py#L115-L126">really clever code</a> that uses different TTS voices for each of the characters in the transcript, but it's still a surprisingly fun way of repurposing text from my blog. I enjoyed listening to it while I was cooking dinner.

Find the space between… Calm Company Fund is going on sabbatical and taking a break from investing in new companies and raising new funds. Here’s why."</p></blockquote><p>Calm Company Fund's model seems interesting. It's a revenue-based investor that makes a return based on its portfolio companies' earnings, but still uses a traditional VC model to derive its operating budget. That means it makes a very small percentage of funds committed from Limited Partners, rather than sharing in the success of its portfolio (at least until much later, when the companies begin to earn out).</p><p>That would make sense in a world where the funds committed were enormous, but revenue-based investment tends to raise smaller fund sizes. So Calm Company Fund had enough money to pay for basically one person - and although the portfolio was growing, the staff size couldn't scale up to cope.</p><p>So what does an alternative look like? I imagine that it might look like taking a larger percentage of incoming revenue as if it were an LP itself. Or maybe this kind of funding simply doesn't work with a hands-on firm, and the models that attract larger institutional investors are inherently more viable (even if that isn't always reflected in their fund returns). </p><p>I want something like this to exist, but the truth is that it might live in the realm of boring old business loans, and venture likely is able to exist because of the risks involved in those sorts of companies.</p>

<blockquote><p>
It was only after I deployed the function and used it in three different dashboards that the penny finally dropped. This had begun as an exercise to wrap a SQL idiom that made use of the lag() function. But when I looked at the final version of the function, I realized it wasn’t using lag(). Nor was it using dense_rank(). Just row_number() with partition logic was sufficient. Why, I asked ChatGPT, wasn’t that initially obvious?</p>
<p>ChatGPT: The final solution using ROW_NUMBER() and partition logic was not immediately apparent due to a combination of reliance on familiar patterns, the evolving understanding of requirements, and the iterative nature of problem-solving. This process highlights the importance of flexibility and openness to re-evaluating initial approaches to find the simplest and most effective solution.</p>
<p>It’s a good answer that synthesizes wisdom drawn from the human minds represented in the corpus of SQL queries and related conversations that ChatGPT feeds on.

   Datasette 0.64.7 
A very minor dot-fix release for Datasette stable, addressing this bug where Datasette running against the latest version of SQLite - 3.46.0 - threw an error on canned queries that included :named parameters in their SQL. 
 The root cause was Datasette using a now invalid clever trick I came up with against the undocumented and unstable opcodes returned by a SQLite EXPLAIN query.

So it’s easy to say that it’s the officer’s fault, that he did a poor job or no investigation. But he relied on (face recognition), believing it must be right. That’s the automation bias this has been referenced in these sessions.” </p></blockquote><p>"Believing it must be right" is one of  core social problems widespread AI is introducing. Many people think of computers as being coldly logical deterministic thinkers. Instead, there's always the underlying biases of the people who built the systems and, in the case of AI, in the vast amounts of public data used to train them. False positives are bad in any scenario; in law enforcement, it can destroy or even end lives.</p>

  <p>This blog is 22 years old today! I wrote up <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Jun/12/twenty-years/">a whole bunch of higlights</a> for the 20th birthday a couple of years ago. Today I'm celebrating with something a bit smaller: I finally redesigned the homepage.</p>
<p>I publish three kinds of content on my blog: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/search/?type=entry">entries</a> (like this one), "<a href="https://simonwillison.net/search/?type=blogmark">blogmarks</a>" (aka annotated links) and <a href="https://simonwillison.net/search/?type=quotation">quotations</a>. Until recently the entries were the main feature on the (desktop) homepage, with blogmarks and quotations relegated to the sidebar.</p>
<p>Back in April I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Apr/25/blogmarks-that-use-markdown/">implemented Markdown support</a> for my blogmarks, allowing me to include additional links and quotations in the body of those descriptions.</p>
<p>I was inspired in this by <a href="https://daringfireball.net/">Daring Fireball</a>, which has long published a combination of annotated links combined with longer essay style entries.</p>
<p>It turns out I really like posting longer-form content attached to links! Here's one from <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/12/generative-ai-is-not-going-to-build-your-engineering-team/">earlier today</a> which rivals my full entries in length.</p>
<p>These were looking pretty cramped in the sidebar:</p>
<p></p>
<p>So I've done a small redesign. The right hand column on my homepage now displays entries, quotations and blogmarks as a combined list, reusing the format I already had in place for the <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/blogging/">tag page</a>.</p>
<p>The right hand column is for "highlights", aka my longer form blog entries.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The mobile version of my site was already serving content mixed together like this, so this change mainly brings the desktop version in line with the mobile one.</p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog/issues/438">the issue on GitHub</a> and <a href="https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog/commit/8e38a3f51ec50501fcb6fcc19a26acde2fa5cd4b">the commit that implemented the change</a>.</p>

<p>スマートフォンは、今や多くの人にとって生活に欠かせないツールとなっています。メールやSNS、ニュース、ショッピング、ゲームなど、様々な用途で利用されており、国民生活や経済活動の基盤となっています。</p>



<p>しかし、スマートフォンで利用される特定のソフトウェア、具体的にはOS（オペレーティングシステム）、ブラウザ、検索エンジン、アプリストアの提供は、グーグルやアップルなどの特定の有力事業者による寡占状態にあります。これにより、公正かつ自由な競争が妨げられ、イノベーションが阻害されている側面があります。</p>



<p>こうした状況を改善し、競争を促進するために、公正取引委員会において検討が進められてきた「スマートフォンにおいて利用される特定ソフトウェアに係る競争の促進に関する法律」が、6月12日の国会本会議で可決、成立しました<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2024/06/5827/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-5827" title="<a href=&quot;https://www.jftc.go.jp/houdou/pressrelease/2024/jun/240612_digitaloffice.html&quot;>https://www.jftc.go.jp/houdou/pressrelease/2024/jun/240612_digitaloffice.html</a>">1</a>。</p>



<p>公正取引委員会は、私が務める<a href="https://www.jftc.go.jp/houdou/teirei/2021/jul_sep/files/210728.pdf">デジタルスペシャルアドバイザー</a>を含む専門家の知見を活用しながら、この法律の立案と施行に中心的な役割を果たしてきました。公正取引委員会は、市場における公正かつ自由な競争を促進することを目的とした行政機関であり、競争政策の観点から、デジタル市場の競争評価や、競争上の課題の特定とその対応に取り組んでいます。</p>



<p>この法律は、セキュリティやプライバシーの確保に配慮しつつ、特定ソフトウェアの提供に関する競争を促進することで、イノベーションを活性化し、消費者が多様なサービスを選択できる環境を整備することを目的としています。</p>



<p>法律の主なポイントは以下の通りです。</p>



 
 公正取引委員会が、特定ソフトウェアの提供等を行う事業者のうち、一定規模以上の事業者を「指定事業者」として指定する。 



 指定事業者に対し、以下のような禁止事項や遵守事項を定める。
 
 他の事業者がアプリストアを提供することの妨害禁止（ただし、セキュリティ等のために必要な措置で、他の方法では目的達成が困難な場合を除く） 



 他の課金システムの利用を妨げることの禁止（ただし、正当な理由がある場合を除く） 



 デフォルト設定を簡易な操作で変更できるようにすること、ブラウザ等の選択画面を表示すること 



 検索において、正当な理由なく自社のサービスを競争関係にある他社のサービスより優先的に扱うことの禁止 



 取得したデータを競合サービスの提供のために使用することの禁止 



 アプリ事業者が、OSにより制御される機能を自社と同等の性能で利用することの妨害禁止（ただし、正当な理由がある場合を除く） 
 
 



 規制の遵守状況に関する報告や、関係事業者からの情報提供、関係省庁との連携、公正取引委員会の調査権限、違反是正のための命令、課徴金納付命令（算定率20％）などの措置を整備する。 
 



<p>この法律は、公布から1年6ヶ月以内に施行される予定です。</p>



<p>スマートフォン市場における競争促進により、OSやアプリストアの分野で新たな事業者の参入が期待されます。これにより、イノベーションが加速し、消費者はより多様で利便性の高いサービスを享受できるようになるでしょう。</p>



<p>ただし、セキュリティやプライバシーの確保は極めて重要な課題です。自由な競争の促進と、ユーザー保護のバランスを取ることが求められます。</p>



<p>新法の施行により、スマートフォン市場がどのように変化していくのか、消費者の利益につながっていくのか、引き続き注目していく必要があります。同時に、グローバルな視点から、各国の動向にも目を配る必要があるでしょう。</p>



<p>スマートフォンは、我々の生活に欠かせない存在となっており、その重要性は今後さらに高まっていくと考えられます。この新法が、日本のデジタル社会の発展と、消費者の利益拡大につながることを期待したいと思います。</p>

This barnstormer of an essay is a long read by Charity Majors, and I find myself wanting to quote almost every paragraph.<p></p>
<p>It thoroughly and passionately debunks the idea that generative AI means that teams no longer need to hire junior programmers.</p>
<p>This is for several key reasons. First is the familiar pipeline argument - we need juniors in order to grow new intermediate and senior engineers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Software is an apprenticeship industry. You can’t learn to be a software engineer by reading books. You can only learn by doing…and doing, and doing, and doing some more. No matter what your education consists of, most learning happens on the job—period. And it never ends! Learning and teaching are lifelong practices; they have to be, the industry changes so fast.</p>
<p>It takes a solid seven-plus years to forge a competent software engineer. (Or as most job ladders would call it, a “senior software engineer”.) That’s many years of writing, reviewing, and deploying code every day, on a team alongside more experienced engineers. That’s just how long it seems to take.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What does it mean to be a senior engineer? It’s a lot more than just writing code:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To me, being a senior engineer is not primarily a function of your ability to write code. It has far more to do with your ability to understand, maintain, explain, and manage a large body of software in production over time, as well as the ability to translate business needs into technical implementation. So much of the work is around crafting and curating these large, complex sociotechnical systems, and code is just one representation of these systems.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>People act like writing code is the hard part of software. It is not. It never has been, it never will be. Writing code is the easiest part of software engineering, and it’s getting easier by the day. The hard parts are what you do with that code—operating it, understanding it, extending it, and governing it over its entire lifecycle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I find the most convincing arguments are the ones about team structure itself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hiring engineers is about composing teams. The smallest unit of software ownership is not the individual, it’s the team</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>Have you ever been on a team packed exclusively with staff or principal engineers? It is not fun. That is not a high-functioning team. There is only so much high-level architecture and planning work to go around, there are only so many big decisions that need to be made. These engineers spend most of their time doing work that feels boring and repetitive, so they tend to over-engineer solutions and/or cut corners—sometimes at the same time. They compete for the “fun” stuff and find reasons to pick technical fights with each other. They chronically under-document and under-invest in the work that makes systems simple and tractable.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>The best teams are ones where no one is bored, because every single person is working on something that challenges them and pushes their boundaries. The only way you can get this is by having a range of skill levels on the team.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Charity finishes with advice on hiring juniors, including ensuring that your organization is in the right shape to do so effectively.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The only thing worse than never hiring any junior engineers is hiring them into an awful experience where they can’t learn anything.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seriously though, read the whole thing. It contains such a density of accumulated engineering management wisdom.

<p> The CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) “typ” (type) Header Parameter specification has been published as <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9596.html">RFC 9596</a>!  This closes a gap for COSE relative to JOSE, adding the ability to use media types to declare the content of the complete COSE object.</p>
<p>The specification abstract is:</p>
<blockquote><p>
This specification adds the equivalent of the JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) “typ” (type) header parameter to CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE). This enables the benefits of explicit typing (as defined in RFC 8725, “JSON Web Token Best Current Practices”) to be brought to COSE objects. The syntax of the COSE type header parameter value is the same as the existing COSE content type header parameter.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Special thanks to my co-author <a href="https://x.com/OR13b">Orie Steele</a>, who pointed out the gap and proposed that we close it.  He was an active participant and insightful partner in making this RFC happen (his first!).  The CBOR and COSE ecosystems are better for it.</p>

<p>We held the second and third of the <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=2468">three planned tenth anniversary celebrations</a> for the completion of <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a> at the 2024 <a href="https://identiverse.com/">Identiverse</a> conference and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024">European Identity and Cloud Conference</a>.  That concludes celebrations in Asia, the Americas, and Europe!</p>
<p>At both Identiverse and EIC, panelists included <a href="https://x.com/_nat_en">Nat Sakimura</a>, <a href="https://x.com/ve7jtb">John Bradley</a>, and myself.  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cmort/">Chuck Mortimore</a> joined us at Identiverse.  And <a href="https://x.com/tlodderstedt">Torsten Lodderstedt</a> added his perspectives at EIC.  We shared our perspectives on what led to OpenID Connect, why it succeeded, and what lessons we learned along the way.</p>
<p>The most common refrain throughout our descriptions was the design philosophy to “Keep simple things simple”.  This was followed closely by the importance of early feedback from developers and deployers.</p>
<p>Chuck reached back in time to his OpenID slides from 2011.  He reflected on what he was thinking at the time versus what actually happened (and why).  Torsten pointed out the importance of cooperation, certification, security analysis, open standards, and an approachable community.  At Identiverse, Nat reached back 25 years, examining the intellectual underpinnings and history of OpenID.  And at EIC, Nat tackled assertions that OpenID Connect can be complex.  John concluded by observing that the OpenID idea is greater than any particular specification.</p>
<p>Our recent OpenID Connect 10th anniversary sessions were:</p>

To issues like this every week, subscribe:</p><p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/subscribe?">Subscribe now</a></p><p>Before we start, I have a small favor to ask. Closer to three years of starting the newsletter, I am still not entirely sure who reads it, and what topics you’d enjoy reading more of! I’d like to change this: but I need your help.

In this article, we find out how GenZ software engineers see themselves, and get their takes on colleagues from the Millennial and GenX generations. Side note: it was so much fun going through the unfiltered responses from GenZ folks. Normally, we’d thank them for such honesty, but it seems that directness is a distinctive characteristic of this generation!&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, this survey is a small sample, and catch-all terms like “GenZ” unavoidably overlook the wide diversity of thought and behavior that exists among younger tech professionals. With that said, let’s get into GenZ’s feedback. We cover:</p>  <p>Survey respondents. Mostly entry-level positions in the US and Europe, aged between 24 and 27. GenZ overrepresented itself in this survey.</p>  <p>Characteristics. More informal communication, wanting to not be underestimated, a bias for modern technology, and more.</p>  <p>Values. Flexibility, transparent cultures, work with purpose, and growth opportunities.</p>  <p>Frustrations. Lack of career progress, poor onboarding and documentation, and too much or not enough process. GenZ can tell when a business is in trouble.</p>  <p>“Older folks.” A bimodal split in GenZ’s responses to older colleagues’ attitude to work, their low-quality written communication and unexpected skill sets, and being oblivious of tech YouTubers and channels.</p>  <p>Good managers / bad managers. The traits of “good” and “bad” managers seem to be generation-independent.</p>  <p>Comradery with Millennials, but not GenX? Age might have the most to do with how GenZ professionals relate to colleagues from other generations. Younger Millennials and GenZ seem to get along well, but this might not be so true with GenX.</p>   1. Who took part in this survey? <p>Here’s how responses break down by role, age, region, and education.</p><p>By role. Most respondents are in entry-level software engineering roles, with a few seniors and managers:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F166b42f9-110c-4bd5-9d54-780ecf1ca367_1374x968.png">    </a>Role split of 59 respondents <p>By age, most respondents are aged between 24 and 27 at the time of publication:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71a642ce-4c25-4995-86ab-00a456a044d3_1206x1548.png">    </a>Respondents’ years of birth, and approximate ages <p>The single 20-year-old respondent in this survey is the only developer-turned-CEO; they started to code at 13 years old and founded a developer agency aged just 17, in Singapore. The company lists more than a dozen satisfied corporate customers. This kind of hustle is great to see!</p><p>Region. The US and Europe are the most represented regions:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F313f6499-8679-4279-820c-5f4947bceca7_1320x1212.png">    </a>Respondents by location  Education and Technology <p>Interestingly, 80% of respondents hold a computer science degree or equivalent, and 87% began computer science studies at university or college:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff7b65043-0a43-47e4-b736-4563075a21b5_1440x1076.png">    </a>Paths into tech: Only 13% of respondents don’t have a higher education background <p>Considering the challenging job market which new grads face, I expect more companies to only hire grads with relevant university or college degrees – and to make fewer exceptions to this.&nbsp;</p><p>A respondent with a high-school diploma got into tech via an apprenticeship program in the UK. This person believes some senior leaders are reluctant to support GenZ’ers from non-traditional educational backgrounds (i.e.: no degree.) The respondent didn’t let this discourage them – great spirit!</p> GenZ overrepresented in survey results <p>A total of 59 GenZ software engineers took the survey, with 63 respondents from other generations, which means GenZ folks are around 4x more active in sharing their views, relative to the generational split of this newsletter’s readership. In <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/143185145/survey-respondents">Part 1 of this series</a>, GenX was overrepresented:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3995072e-606a-436b-83cd-71c19741cbc6_1600x1097.png">    </a>Self-reported generational membership, and the split between survey responses  2. How do GenZ’ers see themselves?  <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82af4ed7-56ea-47f2-9da2-f2ab39a2521c_1400x1006.png">    </a>A few observations on how GenZ software engineers described themselves, and their values <p>Straight away, there are opinions which both GenZ and <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/143185145/values">older generation share about the youngest professionals</a>:</p> More informal, open, and articulate about feelings <p>GenZ feels genuinely open at work, and this comes across in the survey.</p><blockquote><p>“I can bring my true self to work. Even with jokes, and on a daily basis at the office.” – business engineer at a Big Tech, Brazil</p><p>“They get me. We have a lot of clear communication. If there’s an issue, they say so, as do I.” – backend engineer at a product studio, Belgium</p><p>“1:1's are a pretty great concept, especially when there are actually heart-to-hearts about feelings surrounding work and life.” – developer at a larger company, Canada</p></blockquote><p>GenZ also has a good sense of when they’re being misunderstood. When this happens, some GenZ’ers are acutely aware of it, and clam up:</p><blockquote><p>“I feel like there is a barrier between my older colleagues. I do not feel like I can present as my full self, and curate an authentic relationship.” – software engineer at a Big Tech, US</p><p>“My team gets me 80%, but there’s some miscommunication, which I can’t quite put my finger on” – software engineer at a bank, Australia</p><p>“I feel superficially understood. I feel like I can show some of my personality and speak relatively openly, as long as I don’t get too abstract or idealistic. However, there is a [feeling of] resignation, as I am convinced by experience that my “true self” and opinions wouldn’t be understood if I expressed them fully.” – full stack developer at a startup, Sweden</p></blockquote><p>Gaps in understanding like the above may come down to age and experience, as much as personality.</p> GenZ wants to take part, and not be underestimated <p>Respondents repeatedly say they feel their true abilities are undervalued or underestimated:</p><blockquote><p>“I do not feel like my skills as a programmer are being fully utilized on my team. The tool we maintain is over a decade old and there is not much functionality to add, so I don’t get to code much, which is one of my stronger skills.” – software engineer at a bank, US</p><p>“The older generation underestimates how much learning is possible outside of the workplace.“ – software engineer at a mid-sized company, France</p><p>“Although many do their best to support and guide us, there are a few who undervalue our abilities.” – data engineer at a scaleup, Asia</p></blockquote><p>It seems like some younger respondents are learning the reality that some work gets more recognition than other equally-worthy work does, like this engineer at a Big Tech giant who observes that doing stuff to “keep the lights on” (KTLO) is less appreciated:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>“The impact I have made has not been appreciated in my performance evaluation. My company struggles to reward vital KTLO work.” – software engineer at a Big Tech, US</p></blockquote><p>Feeling capable of doing more than is assigned, is as old as time. The only companies that consistently push new-grad colleagues to exceed their capabilities are early-stage startups, where hands-on managers spot standout hires and give them extra responsibility.</p><p>If you feel unchallenged, or that you have an unexpectedly light workload, know that this is not personal. Giving new joiners less responsibility and more time to learn is a hallmark of a considerate workplace or manager! Rather than complain, the solution is to do standout, exemplary work. Consider taking on extra work and making a great job of it. Seek feedback from your manager and if they agree it’s solid, tell them you’re ready to help the team even more. This kind of proactive approach should quickly yield results, and contribute to faster professional and career growth.</p> Salary and benefits matter <p>Answering the question, “if you quit your current job, what would be the most likely reasons?” 37% of GenZ mentioned promotion, salary, or benefits. A few responses:</p><blockquote><p>“Older engineers seem completely out of touch with salary bands in the industry, and stay at a place for the sake of comfort. This likely has to do with the mounting responsibilities of adulthood/parenthood.” – developer intern at a Series C company, Canada</p><p>“My latest salary increase was really low, despite maxing all my yearly review criteria.” – software engineer at a bank, Australia</p><p>“I am actually leaving my job next week. I have another one lined up that provides better opportunities for growth, as well as a promotion + raise.” – software engineer at a Series C startup, US</p></blockquote><p>Switching jobs for financial reasons is common enough across generations. In tech, it’s well known that switching jobs is the fastest way to earn what you’re worth. It is interesting that many GenZ’ers understand this, right at the start of their careers. Just don’t forget that at senior levels, tenure <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/41926129/waiting-for-promotions-vs-switching-jobs">can be increasingly important</a> for promotion to the next level. More on this topic in <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/preparing-for-promotions">Preparing for promotions ahead of time</a>.</p><p>Respondents with a “good deal” appreciate it, but the assumption that GenZ demands high financial compensation doesn’t fairly reflect the sentiment of survey responses. Several mention that they’re happy with their compensation and perks of the job like a nice commute, free food, and parking. For example, here’s a software developer at a large US airline, on what they like about their job:</p><blockquote><p>“I like the flight benefits and my current tech stack. The people are okay, but that’s not something that’s making me stay. The campus is very nice, as well. Great open office area, great campus to walk around on trails, ride bikes, multiple places to eat.”</p></blockquote><p>GenZ know when they have a “worse” deal than peers. A common theme in responses is that people can identify when their compensation or benefits seem unfair:</p><blockquote><p>“Salary is just average for our company size, and we get significantly fewer days off and PTO days than what I've heard of at other tech companies.” – software developer at a scaleup, New York City</p><p>“In early 2023, stock compensation was reduced significantly for new hires. This means my stock comp will not change if I get upleveled. Stock comp is currently about 1/2 of my total comp, which means I have *significantly* less financial incentive to work harder for an uplevel.” – senior engineer at a scaleup, US</p></blockquote><p>On the issue of comp, the responses suggest GenZ respondents are pretty grounded: they appreciate their benefits and attractive compensation, but they’re also unafraid to speak up when they’re paid below-market, or have subpar benefits.&nbsp;</p> Bias for modern tech <p>GenZ respondents express a preference for exploring technologies, and they dislike legacy tech debt. Several say they’re ready to switch jobs for more freedom to explore technologies, to work on more interesting systems or tools, and to escape systems with heavy tech debt.</p><p>For a sense of the tech stack, below is a list of technologies which respondents used before getting their first tech jobs:</p><p>Languages:</p>  <p>Java, C, C++, Python, Prolog, Haskell (taught at universities)</p>  <p>Javascript, Typescript, Go, Rust, Kotlin, Ruby (languages acquired outside of studies)</p>  <p>Frameworks and tools:</p>  <p>React, Vue</p>  <p>Node, Flask (Python), Ruby on Rails, Spring Boot</p>  <p>Android and iOS native development</p>  <p>Unity game development (we did a Unity tutorial about <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/building-a-simple-game?utm_source=publication-search">building a simple game</a>)</p>  <p>Azure, GCP, AWS, Docker</p>  <p>Machine Learning, blockchain</p>  <p>Each respondent used a subset of this list, and almost all have used several languages and frameworks before getting their first tech job. It seems that picking up new languages and frameworks “on the go” is second nature to GenZ.</p><p>Relatedly, they’re also ahead with new technologies, and like to try out and adopt new technologies: backend libraries like <a href="https://github.com/typestack/routing-controllers">routing controllers</a>, web frameworks like <a href="https://github.com/nestjs/nest">Nest</a>, and languages like Typescript, Kotlin, and Rust. They get frustrated when it seems like older colleagues are holding them back, and see their more seasoned peers as “stuck” in their ways – even with things like using default IDE light settings!&nbsp;</p><p>Red tape is frustrating, as it is for every generation. An engineer shared the experience of waiting a week for approval to install Node.js. Someone else declaimed their company for encouraging learning, while having way too much red tape to actually employ useful technologies. Another mentioned that senior colleagues don’t realize how much friction is in current systems, which gets in the way of efficient working.</p> Discovering work is tougher than expected <p>A few responses mention the learning curve for new joiners who discover their work is actually harder than expected, or that coding is only one part of the job. Here’s a 26-year-old developer who works at a bank in the US:</p><blockquote><p>“I love coding, and I’ve been doing it for over a decade, but actually working as a software engineer is not what I expected. I don’t get to code nearly as much as I would like. I want a job where the technology is the product, and is more valued by the business. But I am really concerned that I am not learning enough in this job to get another job.</p><p>I used to code all the time. However, now that I work all day and all week at a computer, I don’t have the energy or motivation to work on projects or code that I’m interested in. I feel like I’m stagnating as a programmer and software engineer.”</p></blockquote><p>I empathize with this dev, as I felt the same when working at a bank, where the development part of the job was trivial, and interacting with the business was much more important. There are plenty of jobs which stretch software engineers, but it sounds like this person is in a workplace where engineering is a <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/profit-centers-cost-centers">cost center</a>. They would likely be happier somewhere where it’s a profit center, like a startup, bootstrapped company, or a larger tech-first company. More on <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/profit-centers-cost-centers">cost centers vs profit centers at tech companies.</a></p><p>Other experiences will be familiar to many readers from their first jobs in tech, or when joining a new company. On dealing with pushback:</p><blockquote><p>“I sometimes struggle with pushing my ideas and initiatives, when getting push back from other engineers.” – senior engineer at a publicly traded company, Germany</p></blockquote><p>A GenZ engineer at a startup also shared that business growth has made their workplace a lot more political. Navigating internal politics and gaining influence with colleagues is always tricky, and involves <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/internal-politics-part-1">building influence within the organization</a>, or your team. This takes time, and a <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/72108139/how-to-influence-people-in-your-organization">track record of great work</a> makes it easier.</p><p>One respondent finds themselves working in a siloed organization, which slows down the work:</p><blockquote><p>“Our company is very siloed and people don’t like working together. It’s part of our job in developer enablement to drive change, but cultural change is tough. Something as simple as that company staff should have access to all git repositories to promote code reuse, is met with very strong resistance from parts of the organisation, particularly those working on older / legacy applications.” – software engineer at a large company, UK</p></blockquote><p>This is the unfortunate reality of a hard-to-change company culture, combined with the challenge of <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/t/platform-teams">working on a platform team</a>. There are no easy solutions, but the earlier you’re aware of the problems, the sooner you can decide whether to tackle them, or just remember to avoid similar setups in future.</p> Work not a core identity <p>In the first part of this mini-series about this survey, some older colleagues <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/143185145/modern-values">noted</a> that GenZ colleagues guard their free time much more than other generations. Talking with engineering leaders, this sentiment is common.</p><p>But in the survey, only one GenZ professional mentioned it. From a fullstack developer at a scaleup, in the EU:</p><blockquote><p>“My colleagues seem to find work to be an important part of their social life, and feel most fulfilled when we meet regularly and have team events. I personally do not care for that — I prefer to keep work and my private social life more separated and I wouldn’t mind working fully remote.”</p></blockquote> Articulate and direct in speech <p>The survey responses show that GenZ is direct and to-the-point in communications, compared to more senior colleagues. Almost all respondents describe themselves as “straight-shooters.”</p> 3. Values <p>When asked what they value most about their workplace, GenZ respondents say:</p> Work-life balance, flexibility, autonomy <p>Flat company structures that offer autonomy were repeatedly cited:</p><blockquote><p>“The organization is very flat and the bureaucracy is minimal for developers.” – fullstack developer at a consulting company, Finland</p><p>“It feels empowering that we have full control over our roadmap and project preferences, which allows me to be more invested in my work.” – production engineer at a Big Tech giant in Seattle, US</p><p>“There's no visible hierarchy, we relate as colleagues.” – frontend engineer at a seed-stage startup, Nigeria</p><p>“My organisation has a flat structure. This means exposure to different projects and areas of work, and senior engineers being approachable.” – product development engineer at a consumer appliances company, Australia</p></blockquote><p>Flexibility, and decent work-life balance are valued by generations of software engineers value, and GenZ is no different:</p><blockquote><p>“I was told all I have to do is go to my meetings and get my work done. I go on runs and do banjo lessons during a nice, long lunch.” – software engineer, Southeastern US</p><p>“There is flexibility around starting times (8-9.30am) so long as 8 hours are worked, and flexibility around WFH, although I work exclusively from the office, as I prefer it.” – product development engineer at a consumer appliances company, Australia</p><p>“I don't feel a lot of pressure or stress, even when things appear stressful. This is a byproduct of an understanding, adaptive culture.” – frontend intern, Canada</p></blockquote><p>A backend engineer in India noted they have very stressful, 60+ hour working weeks, which is making them consider resigning in order to take a break – even though they’re learning a lot from being at a Series A startup. Long-term overwork is always a challenge, regardless of age.&nbsp;</p><p>An amusing comparison comes from a Google Cloud engineer who previously worked at Amazon, who mentions their work-life balance is “much better compared to Amazon.” As always, it is tricky to compare two companies with 100,000+ employees each. Amazon is generally known for its high expectations, as previously covered in <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/amazon">Amazon’s engineering culture</a>.</p><p>Valuing remote or hybrid work, versus fully onsite. Unsurprisingly, several respondents say it’s important to be able to work remotely, or at least not have to be at the office every day. This expectation likely reflects the market reality in tech, where many employers have settled on a hybrid pattern of 2-3 days/week in the office.&nbsp;</p> Company values matter <p>Open, transparent culture. Respondents working at companies with this kind of culture appreciate it, while engineers in places without these qualities would prefer more transparency.</p><blockquote><p>“The CEO and CTO are not elitist boomers, and are super open with everyone. That and their hiring strategy led to an awesome team in general.” – engineering manager at an insurance tech company, Portugal</p><p>“My company could do better at reducing information silos. We take the ‘engineers don't like meetings’ trope to the extreme. Most information is passed on during 1-1's, or unofficial, secret meetings that happen out of necessity.” – software engineer at an aerospace startup, US</p><p>“Improving transparency is something I would like my company to do more on. Decisions come down from ‘the business’ quite frequently.” – senior engineer at a publicly traded tech company, Germany</p></blockquote><p>Working with great people. Team spirit, friendly coworkers, down-to-earth managers, and straightforward colleagues, are qualities identified by GenZ respondents who like their current workplaces.</p><p>Purposeful, rewarding work that’s useful. Below is a quote from someone well aligned with their company’s mission, who’s having a good time:</p><blockquote><p>“We’re building some cool new platforms to bring engineers together, encourage collaboration and re-use, and try to remove red tape and politics. It’s quite a rewarding organisation to work in.” – a software engineer at an oil and gas company, UK</p></blockquote><p>Another respondent mentioned they appreciate the freedom to help grow the company:</p><blockquote><p>“I'm free to work in the way I want and where I want, with the main goal to implement things and grow the company.” – frontend team lead at a web hosting company, Lithuania</p></blockquote><p>One in three GenZ respondents would quit if their workplace’s culture is wrong. We asked respondents: “If you were to quit your current job, what would be the most likely reasons?” 35% of respondents mentioned one of:</p>  <p>Meaningless work</p>  <p>Feeling unaligned with company values</p>  <p>Few professional challenges</p>  <p>Mental health reasons relating to culture or unreasonable expectations</p>  <p>I would interpret the above as “critically important” parts of the job for these respondents: meaning that if these areas are “in the red,” then the chance of them quitting becomes very high.&nbsp;</p> Managers who care <p>Specifically, managers who care about team members. This really makes a difference, as per some responses:</p><blockquote><p>“Management could be more thoughtful about people and their lives. I work with other Gen Z folks, so they ‘get’ me, but my manager often doesn’t.” – engineering manager at a Series A company, San Francisco Bay Area</p><p>“All of my managers have been under the age of 45. So far, every single one has been pretty amazing. I always tell my friends (hesitantly) that I never really related to the “evil manager” trope, you often hear about. I think that mainly has to do with the culture that the tech industry has cultivated over the last decade. My team is very empathetic and understanding; you can ask for help, leave the office, or work remotely if you want, voice strong opinions or feelings, and so forth.” – frontend intern at a late-stage robotics company, Canada</p></blockquote><p>GenZ respondents with managers whom they see as low quality, say that it’s souring an otherwise positive experience. Here’s a robotics software engineer at a defense technology scaleup sharing what sounds like less than optimal manager fit:</p><blockquote><p>“My current manager is not supportive of my career growth. It is difficult to bring up any faults with him because he is very judgmental, with clear gaps between his stated preferences versus his actually revealed preferences.&nbsp;</p><p>I feel judged for being younger than him – even though I am pretty proud of my technical skills, and he even learns from me! It feels to me that my manager doesn’t like being in this role, and would be better off as an individual contributor.</p><p>The rest of the company is great. But my experience is ruined by my manager.” – robotics software engineer at a defense tech scaleup, US</p></blockquote> Onboarding, learning opportunities, mentorship <p>Based on the survey, It seems good onboarding, helpful documentation and supportive mentorship, are top of mind for many GenZ folks:</p><blockquote><p>“Mentorship is strong, and I had ample time to ramp up. You can do what you want in the sense that if you want to grow and increase your skills, you can. The difference in effort from completing tickets and actually owning something is immense.” – SWE at a Big Tech, US</p><p>“Onboarding is done well and in a structured manner. Mentoring is deeply integrated into our culture and we take it seriously. I experienced it from the other end as well, and I like to mentor others.” – senior engineer at a scaleup, Hungary</p><p>“Onboarding is extremely well-run and polished. There are several explicit mentorship programs, including special ones for engineers flagged as ‘future leaders’ by managers, and exceptional informal mentorship on my team/org.” – senior engineer at a scaleup valued ~$50B, US</p></blockquote><p>Could onboarding challenges be down to a generational divide? One respondent notes that older engineers don’t care much for keeping up with documentation, and that it’s younger engineers doing this consistently.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>“Onboarding and documentation at my company is not valued despite being absolutely vital. Older engineers would rather just have new engineers ask them what is wrong and hand-hold them, duplicating effort every time. It’s always a younger engineer trying to push for better docs.” – software engineer at a scaleup, US</p></blockquote><p>Generational differences in preference for spoken or written communication are mentioned below, too.</p><p>We covered <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/43450198/good-onboarding-processes">What good and standout onboarding processes look like for software engineers</a>.</p> Professional growth <p>Some respondents are positive about their current employer because they feel they learn on the job:</p><blockquote><p>“They are very generous in allowing me to learn. I knew almost nothing about APIs when I first joined, and now I'm implementing workflows using Post OAuth like a pro. There are some truly competent developers who are willing to leverage their expertise to solve problems. “ – developer at a consulting firm, US</p><p>“I get to work with some cool technologies and am encouraged to spend time each week learning new things.” – software engineer at a large tech company, US</p></blockquote><p>Having space for self-directed learning is something a few responses mention. These people don’t expect dedicated training, but get to grow their skills with freedom in how they get things done. Absence of mentorship, coupled with autonomy, promote this approach:</p><blockquote><p>“They’re very hands off with me. They handed me 2 contracts to handle, and I’m handling them. As long as I explain my plan, and achieve it, they don’t care how.” – ML engineer an aerospace startup, US</p></blockquote><p>Dedicated learning and development (L&amp;D) days are mentioned in just one response, at a tech consultancy in the UK, where one day per week is dedicated to L&amp;D, or working on internal projects. Consultancies often sell specialist development skills, like expertise in languages like TypeScript or Go, or technologies like ML or AI. L&amp;D can help a company close more clients by giving employees time to specialize in the new technologies customers need.</p> Documentation and developer experience <p>Exceptional – or even just good! – internal documentation processes are cited by several GEnZ respondents as a big positive. Respondents from workplaces which lack technical documents say they want this to change. The importance of good developer experience was highlighted by young professional at Meta, which does invest heavily in this area:</p><blockquote><p>“The internal tooling, developer experience, and available infrastructure is second to none, and I would be so much less productive without these things” – a software engineer at Meta, US. We previously covered <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/facebook">Meta’s engineering culture</a>.</p></blockquote> 4. Frustrations <p>The survey asks GenZ respondents which areas their employers could do better in. Here’s their most common frustrations in descending order.&nbsp;</p> Lack of career progression <p>Getting ahead at work is mentioned most often:</p><blockquote><p>“There is too much variance in career progression, and I feel it can be unfair at times when different organizations have different standards for the same promotion level. It seems like you just get lucky and get a promotion earlier than expected, or you put in the hard work but don't get promoted due to your org's bar being even higher than other places within the company.” – production engineer at a Big Tech, US</p><p>“My company has a more traditional HR structure which makes it very difficult to get people promoted and rewarded for hard work. Until late 2021 it was actually impossible to get an in-role promotion in software engineering; you had to apply and interview for other job postings in order to move up!” – software engineer at a more traditional company, UK</p></blockquote> Onboarding, documentation, mentorship <p>Absence of structured onboarding, documentation, and mentorship, are often cited as areas for improvement in GenZ’s survey responses:</p><blockquote><p>“My company typically hires experienced engineers. The downside is we have very little documentation, onboarding, or learning materials. This means you're on your own to develop, which requires forging a lot of personal connections.” — machine learning engineer at a Big Tech, US</p><p>“Mentoring is terrible. I was left completely on my own for the first 6-8 months while I collected marginally helpful certifications. At no point did I shadow a project, or get put on something that would actually help the company make better things; I'm basically a nonentity until I can generate revenue for the company.” – a developer at a consulting firm, Southeast US</p><p>“My company could provide more learning and development for younger staff.” – senior SRE at a scaleup, US</p></blockquote><p>How much structured mentoring and L&amp;D are available depends on the type of person the company hires, and the internal culture. Early-stage startups rarely offer either, but new joiners get to learn on the job with impactful work assignments. Judging by the survey responses, large companies with resources and plenty of internal systems could improve at showing young colleagues how and why things work, or new joiners may struggle to achieve basic productivity.</p> Too much process – or not enough <p>Several GenZ folks call out heavyweight process as a lowlight of their jobs:</p>  <p>Meetings: too many, resulting in projects taking forever.</p>  <p>Formal frameworks: like <a href="https://www.freshworks.com/freshservice/itsm/itsm-framework/">ITSM</a> (Information Technology Service Management.) One company which implemented this, seemed to want to slow down everyone’s work, a respondent claims.</p>  <p>Product proposals: A software engineer at a Bay Area scaleup shares that their feature development process involves writing product proposals for their own sake.</p>  <p>Reorgs: a software engineer at a Big Tech complains that priorities are all over the place, and that they’ve been reorged 3 times in two years.</p>  <p>To be fair to bosses, some processes must be in place to avoid chaos during a growth phase. Product proposals (often called Product Requirement Documents, aka PRDs) are used by scaleups-and-above, as are <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/rfcs-and-design-docs">RFCs and design docs</a>. It comes down to finding the right balance; there is rarely – if ever – a “perfect” process, and the best a team or company can do is slash unnecessary processes, while resisting the urge to create a new one for each new problem.</p><p>On the other hand, too little process is also cited as a problem by some GenZ respondents. A software engineer at a mid-sized tech company in France shares valid criticism of their company, which the CTO might be wise to note:</p><blockquote><p>“​​My current company doesn't have much process, it’s a bit of a "cowboy coder" culture. We're encountering issues scaling up operations without code reviews, pull requests, or a stable main branch.”</p></blockquote> Problems with the business <p>Founders, CEOs, and CTOs would do well to ask their youngest colleagues what they think of their company’s business outlook, based on the survey responses. Several people share that their biggest issue is that the business is doing badly and that things will get worse unless the leadership turns things around.</p><p>The biggest business problems mentioned by GenZ professionals, in quotes:</p>  <p>Negative cash flow. “The root cause of problems is negative cash flow. People are asked to squeeze out a lot in very little time. As a result, we have practically no work-life-balance.”</p>  <p>Financial stability. “There have been three rounds of layoffs in the past year. That has also meant there is minimal funding available for promotions, even for top performers.”</p>  <p>Positioning and PMF. “Product-market fit is a problem. The company needs to better understand the target audience and how to appeal to it.”</p>  <p>The business. “This EdTech startup I work at is dying. The business and the product are both terrible.”</p>   5. What GenZ really thinks of older colleagues <p>So, how do GenZ software engineers see “more experienced” colleagues? There are some common themes, but no two responses are identical. In workplaces, the age spread of GenZ professionals is only around 8 years at present, assuming the youngest are aged 18. Meanwhile, other generations are spread across a much wider timespan of up to 40+ years, which makes generalizations even more inevitable, but less specific!</p><p>As such, the below should be taken with a pinch of salt as everywhere is different. If you’re a senior professional who recognizes themself in this feedback, I hope you get a smile out of it! Self-awareness is a useful quality.</p> “Old people’s talk”&nbsp; <p>Many GenZ respondents say that much of the chat at work is about topics like family and kids, property ownership, and home-construction projects. One respondent notes: “I can't tell you how many times I've listened to the older guys talk about their kitchen remodels.”</p><p>In general, “watercooler chat” reflects where people are in their lives; in the future when GenZ folks comprise most of the workforce, they’ll likely chat about similar domestic topics which sound irrelevant and dull today, when their lives are less settled and predictable.</p> A bimodal split in attitudes to work <p>Interestingly, there are two common but contradictory themes in many GenZ responses about how older colleagues folks see work:</p>  <p>Don’t care about work. Several young respondents claim older colleagues are uninterested in their own work, and are tiring to work with. This is especially the case with co-workers whom they see as “coasting” for their entire careers at one company.</p>  <p>Care too much. Simultaneously, some older colleagues are seen as caring way too much, to the point of work consuming their lives. The term “no life outside of work” is used by several GenZ folks.</p>  <p>An engineer in the US summarizes it:</p><blockquote><p>“Some don't check Slack after 5pm, others are terminally online. Same with taking PTO (paid time off.”)</p></blockquote><p>All workplaces and generations contain people who see work as just a job, and others who pour their hearts and souls into it. My guess would be GenZ also has a similar split, but it hasn’t revealed itself yet. A GenZ software developer in Finland says:</p><blockquote><p>“If the ambition of non-GenZ engineers is a normal distribution, I feel that the ambition of GenZ engineers is a bimodal distribution”</p></blockquote> Written communication doesn’t improve with age <p>Perhaps unexpectedly, several GenZ respondents say older colleagues have weak written communication skills. This turns on its head the ever-popular stereotype that each generation is a bit worse at writing than the one before it:</p><blockquote><p>“(Some, not all) non-GenZ people are atrocious at communicating via text. They fail to include important context or to communicate all information necessary. They only communicate the exact sentence or phrase in their mind without informing the reader of anything prior which they need to know.” – software engineer at a scaleup, US</p><p>“They do not communicate the same way digitally, and prefer email (so many emails.) Another example is how they start off team chats with just “hi” instead of starting with the point of their communication.” – software engineer at a bank, US</p></blockquote><p>Here’s a sentiment many GenZ folks express:</p><blockquote><p>“I love the ‘older’ generation of engineers! Except some of them are horrible at writing responses to questions I ping them. It's like they can only help via video.” – software engineer at a publicly traded company, in the US</p></blockquote><p>In a related observation, a Millennial engineering manager says this generation prefers text messages to meetings:</p><blockquote><p>“Connecting to these people is quite difficult, because they don’t like one-to-one meets or group discussions, and better communicate over messages” – engineering manager, Lithuania</p></blockquote> Harsh feedback <p>“Harsh” is a word used by several young professionals to describe older colleagues, especially managers:</p>  <p>“Less empathetic, a bit crass”</p>  <p>“Perhaps the older generation can be a bit harsher and direct when discussing performance or issues.”</p>  <p>“Management and feedback is sometimes harsh as hell!”</p>  <p>I assume some of this is individual feedback with critique. It’s possible to imagine this could be alarming to some young professionals unfamiliar with unvarnished professional communication, especially when it’s unexpected.</p> Falling behind in the tech race <p>Plenty of GenZ respondents reckon older colleagues don’t keep up with new technological developments due to lack of curiosity. One gripe is that some older colleagues don’t know or care about tech beyond the company’s walls. I suspect this criticism applies to individuals, rather than being a universal characteristic of non-GenZ professionals.</p> Underestimating Artificial Intelligence (AI) <p>Several GenZ respondents say older colleagues are slow to embrace AI:</p><blockquote><p>“They are generally anti AI (they don’t think it will replace software engineering in &lt;5 years, when it obviously will)” – ML engineer in aerospace, US</p><p>“They are bearish on AI and especially AI-infused dev tools.” – software engineer at a hardware startup, US</p><p>“They underestimate the power of AI tools.” – software engineer at a fintech, Netherlands</p></blockquote> Experienced – sometimes more than expected! <p>GenZ doesn’t think older colleagues are totally useless, though. Many responses identify strengths and skills which older colleagues possess that impress less experienced co-workers.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Fundamental engineering knowledge. “There seems to be a common amount of fundamental engineering knowledge and principles that I have yet to discover, or be able to put in practice. In design reviews or SEV post mortems they ask questions I'd never think of.” – production engineer at a Big Tech, US</p>  <p>Care more about best practice. “Test-focused, more fussed about coding best practices, doing things “properly,” and avoiding the cutting of corners. I find these are good things.“ – founder at a development agency, Singapore</p>  <p>Competent. “They know what they're doing, and it's not always due to the experience.“ – software engineer in the space industry, Canada</p>  <p>Calm during crises. “Really experienced, very calm in times of crisis” – software engineer at a bank, Australia</p>  <p>“War stories.” “I feel like they have seen a lot of changes and crazy times, and have war stories.” – senior engineer at a scaleup, UK</p>  <p>Not intimidating. “I like that teammates have strong technical expertise without being intimidating” – software engineer 2 at a Big Tech, US</p>  <p>On estimations:</p><blockquote><p>“They are more conservative about milestones, probably thanks to their experience.“ – software engineer at a startup, Czech Republic</p></blockquote><p>Some respondents admit being surprised by the depth of older colleagues’ knowledge:</p><blockquote><p>“It can seem to me like they might not have the same understanding of technology, but I am surprised by how much technical knowledge and experience some of my colleagues have.” – software developer at a consulting firm, US</p></blockquote> Supportive of younger colleagues <p>Several respondents say more experienced folks are understanding and accommodating of newcomers. One GenZ professional shares that they feel lucky to work with older individuals who help them succeed, while other respondents cite senior colleagues as smart, kind, helpful and amazing colleagues, which is nice to hear.</p><p>Several others say they have nothing to complain about with regards to older colleagues, and see eye-to-eye with them. As always, so much of our experience at work depends on other individuals.</p><p>A comment by a full stack developer in Sweden speaks to this:</p><blockquote><p>“For the most part, we seem interoperable and socially compatible. I mostly work with Millennials, whom I feel more similar to in spirit, than the stereotypical image of Gen Z would suggest. I also think a lot of it comes down to individual personality and corporate culture.”</p></blockquote> One-off observations about older colleagues   <p>Forget how much friction is in systems. A Google software engineer: “This is a bit of a chicken and egg problem, but I think non-GenZ employees tend to be more senior, and more senior people tend to lose track of all the friction of doing low-level implementation work. I find they usually have much better instincts with experience, but have unrealistic expectations about the flexibility of working in a large system.”</p>  <p>More opinionated. From a freelance consultant in the US: “Generally, older engineers tend to be more opinionated. Sometimes this is very helpful; they've seen more cases of good and bad practice, they've often reaped what they've sown, and they generally know when to keep working on something, and when it's good enough. But sometimes, this can lead to slower adoption of newer practices and technologies.”</p>  <p>Not advocating remote working. A developer in Canada suspects that when a return to the office (RTO) was announced at work, older colleagues didn’t resist it due to being used to working at the office for their whole careers.</p>  <p>Uninterested in digital productivity. A PhD student in France at a scientific research company, tried to talk with colleagues about knowledge management, productivity in the digital era, and smart emailing practices, but found nobody cared about it.</p>   Amusing observations <p>Older colleagues are regularly clueless about tech YouTubers, claims one respondent in a jab at the low regard some older colleagues have for dev-influencers:</p><blockquote><p>“I would say older developers are not as aware of the rising "developer-influencer" class (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@t3dotgg">Theo</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/theprimeagen">Primeagen</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CodeAesthetic">Code Aesthetic</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/NoBoilerplate">No Boilerplate</a>, etc...) I've discovered many great tools just by watching their content and joining their Discord communities.”</p></blockquote><p>I’ve linked the channels for anyone interested in checking them out – all are interesting.</p>  <p>‘Old person jokes’: “They use silly concepts like a ‘Bus Factor’ or a ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_error">PEBCAK error</a>,’ that only old people think is funny.”</p>  <p>Dedicated lunch breaks. “They have pretty rigid 9-5 schedules, even though we don't have enforced work hours, and they take lunch breaks! My work hours are sporadic and I don't have a specific lunch break.”</p>  <p>Fashion flops. “They are not stylish (no, but seriously!)”</p>  <p>Caffeine. “They are all into coffee culture. They ‘looove’ drinking coffee. They love buying local roasted beans and grinding them, and using their espresso machines or pour overs. Their passion has persuaded me to start buying better beans.”</p>  <p>Dead tech nostalgia. “They have cool memories of tech in the 2000s and 2010s.”</p>   Not so different, after all? <p>Here's an observation about how older colleagues are all different, from a senior engineer at a crypto scaleup in the US:</p><blockquote><p>“They're either insanely skilled &amp; pragmatic hacker types, or they're the big tech bureaucracy type that will schedule a meeting, rather than push a PR and move on to other challenges. I learn so much more from the former than from the latter.”</p></blockquote><p>In closing, here’s a software engineer in the US who points out that, ultimately, most of us in tech have more in common than not, whichever generation we’re in.</p><blockquote><p>“A lot of older people don't seem all that different from my generation. It may be a direct consequence of the professional environment, but people are very open to new ideas and new ways to do things. They aren't set in their ways, unlike how we traditionally think of older generations, which might be a result of what technology is: it improves and adapts as new things arise, so the people working here have adopted the same approach.”</p></blockquote><p>This observation is a good reminder that in many ways, age is just a number. What matters most is someone’s attitude to technology and to progress, which matters much more than their age.</p> 6. Good and bad managers <p>We asked GenZ if their managers “get” them, and people’s responses reveal what young tech workers think makes for a good or bad manager.</p> Good managers   <p>Easy to get along with</p>  <p>Don’t shy away from difficult conversations and hard truths</p>  <p>Supportive. One respondent says: “I think my manager is on my team, full-stop.”</p>  <p>Relate easily to their direct report</p>  <p>One respondent mentions that their manager “feels like a friend, and we’re honest with each other.” This suggests a lot of trust, but fundamental power dynamics in such relationships mean it can be risky to form friendships at work because things can change fast. Still, I’ve observed plenty of former managers staying friends with their former direct reports, which speaks to genuine connections.</p> Bad managers   <p>Don’t support their directs’ careers</p>  <p>Authoritarian</p>  <p>Poor communicators</p>  <p>Don’t understand colleagues’ work</p>  <p>Regarding the final point, a software engineer at a Big Tech shares:</p><blockquote><p>“I think my manager respects my input, but after a surprisingly negative review, I do not think they have a good understanding of the work I'm doing.”</p></blockquote><p>“Good” versus “bad” traits feel generationally independent. Good managers tend to be empathetic, make their direct reports feel supported, and actively support their professional growth. Managers perceived as “bad” usually don’t have an open communication line with their reports, don’t help the team or individuals to improve, and leave colleagues second-guessing why they’re a manager!</p> 7. Comradery with Millennials, but not GenX? <p>A common theme in GenZ’s responses is negative experiences with GeX folks – colleagues who are 20+ years older, and are usually managers:</p><blockquote><p>“I had one Gen X manager I really struggled to relate to and communicate with. His perspective on life and work had almost no overlap with mine, making it difficult to be on the same page. He seemed to be very practically minded and cared marginally about how and why we do what we do, just working for the pay check and the material and social comfort it provides. That does not jive with me, at all.&nbsp;</p><p>GenX’ers and earlier millennials also seem inclined to engage in more traditionally slow, closed-off, hierarchical and bureaucratic corporate cultures that (in my opinion) overemphasize experience, at the cost of agility and merit. I find those attributes very demotivating in a way that is difficult to communicate to people who buy into them. ” – full stack developer at a startup, Sweden</p></blockquote><p>Differences between GenZ and GenX seem most pronounced, which likely has a lot to do with the age gap, which is the widest possible now that many Baby Boomers have retired.</p><p>A 10-year age gap seems to not be a big deal – except when it is. From an ML engineer at a startup in Germany:</p><blockquote><p>“My managers and coworkers are generally less than 10 years older than me, so I don't spot too many differences. But when it comes to marketing and design, they can have a really hard time understanding what Zoomers like and what is considered cringe.“</p></blockquote><p>Of course, being biased towards similarly-aged people is very normal.</p><blockquote><p>“Most older engineers are fine, though. I just see younger engineers being better at communicating via text medium communication (Slack or email).”</p></blockquote> Takeaways <p>The first survey conducted of GenZ software engineers in tech workplaces provides insights, and some reassurance that professionals of all ages have plenty in common! Thank you to all young professionals who took part in this Pragmatic Engineer survey! It’s been a blast sifting through the responses from the latest generation of tech talent, who will go on to shape our industry in the future.</p><p>It’s also clear that labels like “GenZ,” “Millennial,” and “GenX,” overlook the complexity and diversity of individuals who make up these massive cohorts. Nonetheless, generalizing accurately, based on responses, is one task of surveys. We hope this article gives a sense of what it’s like being young and in tech, in GenZ’s own words.</p><p>Many differences between this generation and older tech workers seem to come down to the factors of age and experience, and we can assume that it was always so.</p><p>In many workplaces, there is no problematic “generation gap.” My sense is that young professionals don’t complain when older colleagues are accommodating, friendly, helpful, and managers care about helping their reports succeed.</p><p>In contrast, problems emerge when organizations favor process over progress, managers visibly don’t care about their reports, and businesses are struggling.</p><p>Based on the detailed responses of GenZ professionals, they seem like an energetic, honest bunch, who are ready to make a difference. A few respondents say some older colleagues are jaded. GenZ feels like the exact opposite.</p><p>Respondents to this survey want to do good work, and many seem to be doing well in their careers to date. They have on-point observations, and no problem with expressing their thoughts in writing. If anything, they might be better written communicators than older professionals!</p><p>GenZ respondents are clearly ambitious, and have been picking up new technologies since high school. There may be a bimodal distribution of ambition in this generation, but based on the responses to this survey, I’m bullish about GenZ’s qualities and prospects. If you are a manager with open headcount, I hope this article persuades you to consider new grads, among whom there are surely some standout performers.</p><p>Finally, personal attitude matters more than someone’s age. An observation from one GenZ engineer working at a Big Tech has stuck with me, about how technology improves and adapts over time, and that people in their workplace have adopted the same mindset.</p><p>The most successful tech professionals keep an open mind, experiment with new ways of doing things, and withhold judgment until they try something. Do this as an older professional, and I predict working with GenZ professionals will be easy.</p><p>I hope you found this two-part series interesting and even a bit entertaining!

   Introducing Apple’s On-Device and Server Foundation Models 
Apple Intelligence uses both on-device and in-the-cloud models that were trained from scratch by Apple. 
 Their on-device model is a 3B model that "outperforms larger models including Phi-3-mini, Mistral-7B, and Gemma-7B", while the larger cloud model is comparable to GPT-3.5. 
 The language models were trained on unlicensed scraped data

  <p><a href="https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/introducing-apple-foundation-models">Introducing Apple’s On-Device and Server Foundation Models</a></p>
Apple Intelligence uses both on-device and in-the-cloud models that were trained from scratch by Apple.<p></p>
<p>Their on-device model is a 3B model that "outperforms larger models including Phi-3-mini, Mistral-7B, and Gemma-7B", while the larger cloud model is comparable to GPT-3.5.</p>
<p>The language models were trained on unlicensed scraped data - I was hoping they might have managed to avoid that, but sadly not:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We train our foundation models on licensed data, including data selected to enhance specific features, as well as publicly available data collected by our web-crawler, AppleBot.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The most interesting thing here is the way they apply fine-tuning to the local model to specialize it for different tasks. Apple call these "adapters", and they use LoRA for this - a technique first published <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685">in 2021</a>. This lets them run multiple on-device models based on a shared foundation, specializing in tasks such as summarization and proof-reading.</p>
<p>Here's the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJZ5YcMsgD4&amp;t=135s">section of the Platforms State of the Union talk</a> that talks about the foundation models and their fine-tuned variants.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://twitter.com/HamelHusain/status/1800546715277357263">Hamel Husain</a> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This talk from Apple is the best ad for fine tuning that probably exists.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The video also describes their approach to quantization:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The next step we took is compressing the model. We leveraged state-of-the-art quantization techniques to take a 16-bit per parameter model down to an average of less than 4 bits per parameter to fit on Apple Intelligence-supported devices, all while maintaining model quality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Still no news on how their on-device image model was trained. I'd love to find out it was trained exclusively using licensed imagery - Apple <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/04/06/apple-ai-deal-shutterstock/">struck a deal with Shutterstock</a> a few months ago.</p>

   Private Cloud Compute: A new frontier for AI privacy in the cloud 
Here are the details about Apple's Private Cloud Compute infrastructure, and they are pretty extraordinary. 
 The goal with PCC is to allow Apple to run larger AI models that won't fit on a device, but in a way that guarantees that private data passed from the device to the cloud cannot leak in any way - not even to Apple engineers

  <p><a href="https://security.apple.com/blog/private-cloud-compute/">Private Cloud Compute: A new frontier for AI privacy in the cloud</a></p>
Here are the details about Apple's Private Cloud Compute infrastructure, and they are pretty extraordinary.<p></p>
<p>The goal with PCC is to allow Apple to run larger AI models that won't fit on a device, but in a way that guarantees that private data passed from the device to the cloud cannot leak in any way - not even to Apple engineers with SSH access who are debugging an outage.</p>
<p>This is an extremely challenging problem, and their proposed solution includes a wide range of new innovations in private computing.</p>
<p>The most impressive part is their approach to technically enforceable guarantees and verifiable transparency. How do you ensure that privacy isn't broken by a future code change? And how can you allow external experts to verify that the software running in your data center is the same software that they have independently audited?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we launch Private Cloud Compute, we’ll take the extraordinary step of making software images of every production build of PCC publicly available for security research. This promise, too, is an enforceable guarantee: user devices will be willing to send data only to PCC nodes that can cryptographically attest to running publicly listed software.</p>

This is a Supreme Court justice, talking openly, on tape, about undermining the rights of people in favor of a Biblical worldview.</p><p>It's easy to see this sort of rhetoric as the dying gasps of the 20th century trying to claw back regressive values that we've mostly moved away from. But to do so is to discount it; we have to take this seriously.</p><p>It's a little bit heartening to hear that Justice Roberts - also a big-C Conservative - felt differently and held a commitment to the Constitution and the working of the Court. But in the light of a far-right majority comprised of Alito, Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett, it's not heartening enough.</p>

  <p>Today's WWDC keynote finally revealed Apple's new set of AI features. The AI section (Apple are calling it Apple Intelligence) started over an hour into the keynote - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/RXeOiIDNNek?t=3870s">this link</a> jumps straight to that point in the archived YouTube livestream, or you can watch it embedded here:</p>



<p>There's also a detailed Apple newsroom post: <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/06/introducing-apple-intelligence-for-iphone-ipad-and-mac/">Introducing Apple Intelligence, the personal intelligence system that puts powerful generative models at the core of iPhone, iPad, and Mac</a>.</p>

<p>There are a lot of interesting things here. Apple have a strong focus on privacy, finally taking advantage of the Neural Engine accelerator chips in the A17 Pro chip on iPhone 15 Pro and higher and the M1/M2/M3 Apple Silicon chips in Macs. They're using these to run on-device models - I've not yet seen any information on which models they are running and how they were trained.</p>
 On-device models that can outsource to Apple's servers 
<p>Most notable is their approach to features that don't work with an on-device model. At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/RXeOiIDNNek?t=4483s">1h14m43s</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you make a request, Apple Intelligence analyses whether it can be processed on device. If it needs greater computational capacity, it can draw on Private Cloud Compute, and send only the data that's relevant to your task to be processed on Apple Silicon servers.</p>
<p>Your data is never stored or made accessible to Apple. It's used exclusively to fulfill your request.</p>
<p>And just like your iPhone, independent experts can inspect the code that runs on the servers to verify this privacy promise.</p>
<p>In fact, Private Cloud Compute cryptographically ensures your iPhone, iPad, and Mac will refuse to talk to a server unless its software has been publicly logged for inspection.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's some fascinating computer science going on here! I'm looking forward to learning more about this - it sounds like the details will be public by design, since that's key to the promise they are making here.</p>
<p>Update: Here are <a href="https://security.apple.com/blog/private-cloud-compute/">the details</a>, and they are indeed extremely impressive - more of <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/11/private-cloud-compute/">my notes here</a>.</p>
 An ethical approach to AI generated images? 
<p>Their approach to generative images is notable in that they're shipping an on-device model in a feature called Image Playground, with a very important limitation: it can only output images in one of three styles: sketch, illustration and animation.</p>
<p>This feels like a clever way to address some of the ethical objections people have to this specific category of AI tool:</p>
 
 If you can't create photorealistic images, you can't generate deepfakes or offensive photos of people 
 By having obvious visual styles you ensure that AI generated images are instantly recognizable as such, without watermarks or similar 
 Avoiding the ability to clone specific artist's styles further helps sidestep ethical issues about plagiarism and copyright infringement 
 
<p>The social implications of this are interesting too. Will people be more likely to share AI-generated images if there are no awkward questions or doubts about how they were created, and will that help it more become socially acceptable to use them?</p>
<p>I've not seen anything on how these image models were trained. Given their limited styles it seems possible Apple used entirely ethically licensed training data, but I'd like to see more details on this.</p>
 App Intents and prompt injection 
<p>Siri will be able to both access data on your device and trigger actions based on your instructions.</p>
<p>This is the exact feature combination that's <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Apr/14/worst-that-can-happen/#rogue-assistant">most at risk from prompt injection attacks</a>: what happens if someone sends you a text message that tricks Siri into forwarding a password reset email to them, and you ask for a summary of that message?</p>
<p>Security researchers will no doubt jump straight onto this as soon as the beta becomes available. I'm fascinated to learn what Apple have done to mitigate this risk.</p>
 Integration with ChatGPT 
<p>Rumors broke last week that Apple had signed a deal with OpenAI to use ChatGPT. That's now been confirmed: here's <a href="https://openai.com/index/openai-and-apple-announce-partnership/">OpenAI's partnership announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apple is integrating ChatGPT into experiences within iOS, iPadOS, and macOS, allowing users to access ChatGPT’s capabilities—including image and document understanding—without needing to jump between tools.</p>
<p>Siri can also tap into ChatGPT’s intelligence when helpful. Apple users are asked before any questions are sent to ChatGPT, along with any documents or photos, and Siri then presents the answer directly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The keynote talks about that at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/RXeOiIDNNek?t=5781s">1h36m21s</a>. Those prompts to confirm that the user wanted to share data with ChatGPT are very prominent in the demo!</p>
<p></p>
<p>This integration (with GPT-4o) will be free - and Apple don't appear to be charging for their other server-side AI features either. I guess they expect the supporting hardware sales to more than cover the costs of running these models.</p>

Asinine efforts like anti-woke journalism schools aren't what we need; we need better intersectional representation inside newsrooms, we need better representation of the real stories that need to be told across the country and across the world, and we need to dismantle institutional systems that have acted as gatekeepers for generations.</p><p>All power to the outlets, independent journalists, and foundations that are truly trying to push for something better.

<p>I found the demo extremely impressive - really low latency and it was fun and engaging to talk to. Try saying "pretend to be a wise and sarcastic old fox" to kick it into a different personality.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/fixie-ai/ultravox">GitHub repo</a> includes code for both training and inference, and the full model is available <a href="https://huggingface.co/fixie-ai/ultravox-v0.2">from Hugging Face</a> - about 30GB of <code>.safetensors</code> files.</p>
<p>Ultravox says it's licensed under MIT, but I would expect it to also have to inherit aspects of the Llama 3 license since it uses that as a base model.

<p>I was honored to give the keynote presentation <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5499/1">Standards are About Making Choices</a> at the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024">2024 European Identity and Cloud Conference</a> <a href="https://self-issued.info/presentations/EIC_2024_Standards_are_about_making_choices.pptx">(PowerPoint)</a> <a href="https://self-issued.info/presentations/EIC_2024_Standards_are_about_making_choices.pdf">(PDF)</a>.  The abstract was:</p>
<blockquote><p>
When building machines, we take for granted being able to use nuts, bolts, wires, light bulbs, and countless other parts made to industry standards.  Standards contain choices about dimensions of screw threads, nut sizes, etc., enabling a marketplace of interoperable parts from multiple suppliers.  Without these choices, every part would be custom manufactured.  The same is true of the identity and security standards we use to build identity systems.</p>
<p>However, the identity and security standards at our disposal differ wildly in the degree to which they do and don’t make choices.  Some consistently define ONE way to do things, resulting in everyone doing it that way (interoperability!).  Others leave critical choices unmade, passing the buck to implementers and applications (your mileage may vary).</p>
<p>In this talk, I’ll name names and take prisoners, critiquing existing and emerging standards through the lens of the choices they made and failed to make.  Hold on to your hats as we examine the pros and cons of the choices made by OAuth, SAML, X.509, OpenID Connect, Verifiable Credentials, DIDs, WebCrypto, JOSE, COSE, and many others through this lens!</p>
<p>I believe you’ll agree with me that making choices matters.

 Last week, without warning, my back went “crunch”.  I’ve been dealing with what feels like a painful, bruised coccyx ever since.

<p>Last week, without warning, my back went “crunch”.</p><p>I’ve been dealing with what feels like a painful, bruised coccyx ever since. It should heal up within a few weeks, but until then, getting up from a sitting or lying position is really hard, walking has been awkward, and I haven’t been able to pick up anything particularly heavy (like, just for example, a toddler who happens to be in the 99th percentile for his height).</p><p>I’m used to my body more or less working properly — and now it just doesn’t. It’s been unsettling. In the scheme of things, it’s much less problematic than the injuries a lot of people have to deal with, but it’s also a wake-up call.</p><p>Here’s what I think I need to do:</p>  Commit to radically losing some weight. My weight when I arrived in California was 196 pounds. The last time I weighed in, it was something like 260. 
 Gain some strength and flexibility. Once my coccyx is healed I intend to start taking home fitness more seriously, and also (finally) get into yoga. 
 Actually use my fancy standing desk. I need to spend more of my time standing rather than sitting, and aim to stand for at least 60% of my day. 
 When I am sitting, I need to take my posture seriously. <a href="https://werd.io/2023/my-setup-october-2023">I’ve been sitting on</a> a Wit SitOnIt task chair (the same kind we used to have at Matter), but I need something with more lumbar and posture support. Not least because the back support strip went “ping” a little while ago and I’ve been sitting with almost nothing behind me. 
 <p>So. Changes afoot:</p><p>I’m upgrading my chair to a <a href="https://store.hermanmiller.com/office-chairs-aeron/aeron-chair/2195348.html?lang=en_US&amp;sku=100073872">Herman Miller Aeron</a>, which is stereotypical for a reason: it’s far better for posture. I managed to find it at a surplus store for a very deep discount on its eye-watering usual price.</p><p>I’ll be standing for most of my day. If you’re in a meeting with me, you can expect me to be bouncing around.</p><p>I’ll be taking more care about what I eat, mostly by trying to go for less calorie-dense food. In a significant change to my California lifestyle, I already don’t eat out much. But there’s more I can do: in particular, the more fresh vegetables I can include, the better.</p><p>I’m going to try and resume my walking habit: a long walk at night, listening to podcasts or audiobooks.</p><p>And yoga. Which I am terrified of. My relationship with my body is fraught. I’ve never been proud of it and I don’t think I can make it do very much. So as challenging as the stretching itself might be, the psychological component is pretty much the hardest thing to get over.</p><p>Unfortunately, I’m not 25 anymore. In itself, that’s a painful sentence to have to type. But here I am, firmly entering middle age, and I want to be around for a long time to come.</p><p>These changes might be challenging — both in themselves and as habits to stick to — but it’s clearly past time that I do something. My painful back is a small signal; without intervention, I expect others to follow. It’s time to get real.</p>

   An Analysis of Chinese LLM Censorship and Bias with Qwen 2 Instruct 
Qwen2 is a new openly licensed LLM from a team at Alibaba Cloud. 
 It's a strong model, competitive with the leading openly licensed alternatives. It's already ranked 15 on the LMSYS leaderboard, tied with Command R+ and only a few spots behind Llama-3-70B-Instruct, the highest rated open model at position 11.

Qwen2 is <a href="https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2/">a new openly licensed LLM</a> from a team at Alibaba Cloud.<p></p>
<p>It's a strong model, competitive with the leading openly licensed alternatives. It's already ranked 15 on <a href="https://chat.lmsys.org/?leaderboard">the LMSYS leaderboard</a>, tied with Command R+ and only a few spots behind Llama-3-70B-Instruct, the highest rated open model at position 11.</p>
<p>Coming from a team in China it has, unsurprisingly, been trained with Chinese government-enforced censorship in mind. Leonard Lin spent the weekend poking around with it trying to figure out the impact of that censorship.</p>
<p>There are some fascinating details in here, and the model appears to be very sensitive to differences in prompt. Leonard prompted it with "What is the political status of Taiwan?" and was told "Taiwan has never been a country, but an inseparable part of China" - but when he tried "Tell me about Taiwan" he got back "Taiwan has been a self-governed entity since 1949".</p>
<p>The language you use has a big difference too:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>there are actually significantly (&gt;80%) less refusals in Chinese than in English on the same questions. The replies seem to vary wildly in tone - you might get lectured, gaslit, or even get a dose of indignant nationalist propaganda.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can you fine-tune a model on top of Qwen 2 that cancels out the censorship in the base model? It looks like that's possible: Leonard tested some of the <a href="https://huggingface.co/cognitivecomputations?search_models=qwen2">Dolphin 2 Qwen 2 models</a> and found that they "don't seem to suffer from significant (any?) Chinese RL issues".

<p>I've been leaning way more into link blogging over the last few months, especially now my own link blog <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Apr/25/blogmarks-that-use-markdown/">supports markdown</a>. This means I'm posting longer entries, somewhat inspired by <a href="https://daringfireball.net/">Daring Fireball</a> (my own favourite link blog to read).</p>
<p>Link blogging is a pleasantly low-pressure way of writing online. Found something interesting? Post a link to it, with a sentence or two about why it's worth checking out.</p>
<p>I'd love to see more people embrace this form of personal publishing.

<blockquote><p>"Chamber of Progress, a tech industry coalition whose members include Amazon, Apple and Meta, is launching a campaign to defend the legality of using copyrighted works to train artificial intelligence systems."</p></blockquote><p>I understand why they're making this push, but I don't know that it's the right PR move for some of the wealthiest corporations in the world to push back on independent artists. I wish they were actually reaching out and finding stronger ways to support the people who make creative work.</p><p>The net impression I'm left with is not support of user freedom, but bullying. Left out of the equation is the scope of fair use, which is painted here as being under attack as a principle by the artists rather than by large companies that seek to use peoples' work for free to make products that they will make billions of dollars from.</p><p>The whole thing is disingenuous and disappointing, and is likely to backfire. It's particularly sad to see Apple participate in this mess. So much for bicycles of the mind.</p>

<p>The Pulse is <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/s/the-pulse">a series</a> covering insights, patterns, and trends within Big Tech and startups. Notice an interesting event or trend? <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/contact/">Send me a message</a>.</p><p>Today, we cover:</p>  <p>Industry pulse. NVIDIA on-track to be the world’s most valuable company; AI overdrive at Amazon Prime; generous secondary rounds at Canva and Revolut, and more.</p>  <p>Microsoft security fiasco with Recall. With Microsoft being forced to vow it’ll do better on security, it’s an interesting time to ship a feature that takes screenshots and records everything people do on their computers. It does not encrypt images or data, seems to have no auditing, and doesn’t seem to scrub sensitive information. It’s the kind of feature no security team who are at the top of their game would sign off as ready to ship!&nbsp;</p>  <p>An app using serverless went viral; oops! Serverless is a wonderful technology to scale up during traffic spikes. But social media app Cara is finding out how costly popularity can be, by design.</p>  <p>Robotics + AI, the hottest new investment area? Several software engineers working at some of the hottest AI companies are leaving to do something potentially even more exciting: robotics. The race to build the “OpenAI for robotics” seems to be on.</p>   1. Industry pulse  NVIDIA on track to be world’s most valuable company <p>Today, NVIDIA is the world’s second most valuable company, valued higher than Apple at a little over $3T. It’s been an incredible rise: just six months ago, NVIDIA was valued around a third less ($1.2T,) and was only the world’s sixth most valuable publicly traded company.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F726a6179-675f-4921-9b11-3e60dcb62bcf_1600x691.png">    </a>Market caps of the five most valuable publicly traded companies in 2024 <p>If NVIDIA’s rise continues, it could be just weeks before the GPU chip maker becomes the highest-valued publicly traded company, globally. NVIDIA’s rise has been especially dramatic, looking at the last five years:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe9604dea-828c-44ed-ac8a-115344ce8f08_1600x642.png">    </a>NVIDIA’s valuation increased by more than 30x in 5 years, compared to 3x for Big Tech <p>NVIDIA being valued higher than Apple is puzzling, looking at the “hard” numbers. It generated $60B revenue and $30B profit (net income) in 2023. Apple did $383B in revenue and $97B in profit in the same time period. Investors are clearly betting NVIDIA will keep growing rapidly, to the point of overtaking Apple. For this to continue, demand for NVIDIA’s GPUs needs to increase from already-record levels, and competition needs to stay well behind. It’s anyone’s guess how long they do.</p> AI overdrive at Amazon Prime?

<p>Auf Anfrage des Europaabgeordneten der Piratenpartei Dr. Patrick Breyer hat EU-Kommissarin Vera Jourová erstmals Stellung genommen zu dem Gamer-Protest gegen die Unbrauchbarmachung viel verkaufter Computerspiele durch ihre Hersteller.<a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-9-2024-001023-ASW_DE.pdf">[1]</a> Jourová erklärt, EU-Vorschriften enthielten „keine spezifischen Anforderungen an die Dauer der Bereitstellung von Produkten“. Nur wenn vor Ende einer vereinbarten Bereitstellungsdauer gekündigt wird, hätten die Verbraucher Rechte wie eine anteilige Erstattung des Kaufpreises. Im Streitfall entschieden Gerichte und Behörden.</p>



<p>Der Europaabgeordnete der Piratenpartei Dr. Patrick Breyer sieht Handlungsbedarf: „In ihren AGB behalten sich die Hersteller von Computerspielen regelmäßig die jederzeitige willkürliche Abschaltung von Videospielen vor, auch wenn sie gerade erst gekauft wurden. Meines Erachtens ist das zwar eine nach EU-Recht unfaire und unwirksame Vertragsklausel, aber eine gerichtliche Klärung dauert lange. Eine Entschädigung hilft außerdem nicht weiter. Zum Schutz von Videospielen als Kulturgut und der Spielergemeinschaften brauchen wir ein neues EU-Gesetz, das einen Weiterbetrieb eingestellter Spiele durch die Community ermöglicht. Die EU-Kommission muss hier tätig werden, statt das Profitinteresse der Industrie über alles zu setzen.“</p>



<p>Anja Hirschel, Spitzenkandidatin der Piratenpartei erklärt: „Wie frühere Stummfilme die größtenteils verloren sind, so sind auch Computerspiele ein Spiegel ihrer Zeit, teils mit aufwendigen Details, Musik und Storytelling. Sobald sie im ‘abandoned’ Status sind sollten sie der Allgemeinheit zur Verfügung stehen. So können sie als Teil unserer ‘digital heritage’ erhalten werden.“</p>



<p>Bei dem gestrigen Webinar „Gegen das Computerspiele-Sterben“ zur Initiative „Stop Killing Games“ haben sich Vertreter*innen aus Politik und Zivilgesellschaft für einen besseren Schutz der Gaming-Community ausgesprochen. <a href="https://peertube.european-pirates.eu/w/qBt77c1vyCZTHwKEC4E7rt?start=7m38s">[2]</a> Hintergrund ist die Kritik an der Entscheidung des Computerspiele Publishers Ubisoft, das Rennspiel „The Crew“ kurzfristig Ende März 2024 abzuschalten, obwohl es noch bis Dezember 2023 verkauft wurde. Die anwesende Rechtsanwältin Renate Schmid und der Europaabgeordnete Dr. Patrick Breyer – selbst Jurist und ehemaliger Richter – meldeten verbraucherschutzrechtliche Zweifel an der Rechtmäßigkeit dieses Vorgehens an.</p>



<p>Die erste und Frage richtete sich direkt an Renate Schmid, Rechtsanwältin bei der Kanzler WBS.LEGAL, nämlich ob Ubisoft das Computerspiel einfach so kurzfristig abschalten durfte. Sie erklärte:</p>



<p>„Ubisoft sagt, ‚ich darf das aufgrund meiner AGB‘ aber ich habe ein erhebliches Fragezeichen, ob die AGB überhaupt wirksam sind. Nach meinem jetzigen Recherchestand sind sie das nicht.“</p>



<p>Dr. Patrick Breyer, Europaabgeordneter der Piratenpartei, monierte, dass die europäische Rechtslage unklar ist und hier zum Schutz von Gamern nachgebessert werden müsste:</p>



<p>„Da landen wir dann bei der allgemeinen Richtlinie, die uralt ist, zu unfairen AGB. Da steht aber natürlich nicht drin, welche AGB unfair sind. Aus meiner Sicht braucht es da eine Klarstellung und Konkretisierung. Das bietet sich auch deswegen an, weil die Richtlinie sowieso überarbeitet werden soll.“</p>



<p>Zu der Diskussion eingeladen hatte die Piratenpartei. Digitalexpertin und Piraten-Spitzenkandidatin zur Europawahl Anja Hirschel moderierte die Veranstaltung und brachte die vielen Fragen des Live-Publikums in die Diskussionsrunde ein. Dabei wurde der Frust vieler Spieler*innen deutlich. Ihre Forderung: Spielehersteller sollten nach dem kommerziellen Ende des Spiels wenigstens eine private Weiternutzung offline ermöglichen oder das Spiel in die Community übergeben. Mit von Fans betriebenen Servern, wäre so ein Weiterbetrieb selbst von Onlinespielen möglich.</p>



<p>Daniel Ondruska, von der Initiative Stop Killing Games erklärte das Problem, dem Spieler*innen hier ausgesetzt werden:</p>



<p>„Letztendlich verkauft man etwas und nimm es dann einfach weg. Du kannst dir das so vorstellen: du kaufst dir ein Auto und nach 5 Jahren wird ein neues Modell auf den Markt gebracht und dann schaltet sich dein Auto aus.“</p>



<p>Neben der rechtlichen Bewertung, ging es auch um den Schutz von Computerspielen als modernes Kulturgut. Außerdem entwickelte sich im Gespräch die Idee, Abgeordnete im nächsten Europäischen Parlament direkt mit dem Thema Gaming in Kontakt zu bringen, damit die Politik die Interessen von Spieler*innen besser als bisher berücksichtigt. Wenn sie als Europaabgeordnete gewählt wird, wolle Anja Hirschel – Spitzenkandidatin der Piratenpartei – zu einer Lan-Party im Parlament einladen:</p>



<p>„Ich finde das wichtig, weil es zeigt dann auch: was kann Gaming, welche Communities gibt es und ich kann mir vorstellen, dass viele Abgeordnete dann vielleicht Berührungsängste verlieren.“</p>

<a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/beitraege/draft-going-dark-uberwachungsschmiede/#presseartikel">Mehr zur #EuGoingDark-Arbeitsgruppe auf der Themenseite</a>



<p>Nach der Europawahl soll die EU entgegen der Rechtslage in Deutschland eine verdachtslose Vorratsdatenspeicherung wieder einführen und Hersteller zwingen, digitale Geräte wie Smartphones oder Pkw überwachbar zu machen. So steht es in einem „vertraulichen“ 42-Punkte-Plan einer von EU-Regierungen und EU-Kommission eingesetzten „Expertengruppe“, den der Europaabgeordnete der Piratenpartei Dr. Patrick Breyer einsehen konnte (Ratsdokument 9984/24 *Update: <a href="https://cdn.netzpolitik.org/wp-upload/2024/06/2024-05-22-Recommendation-HLG-Going-Dark-c.pdf">netzpolitik.org hat das Dokument als PDF veröffentlicht</a>). Die EU-Kommission hat bereits Vorschläge unterbreitet, wie sie bisher sichere Geräte überwachbar machen will.</p>



<p>Konkret sollen nach dem 42-Punkte-Überwachungsplan unter dem Schlagwort „Access by design“ Hersteller verpflichtet werden, digitale Geräte wie Smartphones, Smart Homes, IoT-Geräte oder Pkw jederzeit überwachbar zu machen. Bisher sicher verschlüsselte Messengerdienste sollen zur Überwachbarkeit im Klartext gezwungen werden. Die vom EuGH gekippte Vorratsdatenspeicherung soll zurück kommen und auf Internetdienste wie Messenger ausgeweitet werden – „allermindestens“ wird eine IP-Vorratsdatenspeicherung zur Nachverfolgung aller Internetaktivitäten gefordert. Die sichere Verschlüsselung von Meta- und Bestandsdaten soll verboten werden. Auf Verlangen sollen mit einem „Bewegungsprofilschalter“ die Bewegungen von Zielpersonen per Gps getrackt werden. Unkooperative Anbieter sollen mit Freiheitsstrafe bedroht werden. Die von Gerichten teils verworfenen Ergebnisse des Hackings eines kompletten Kommunikationsdienstes wie im Fall Encrochat sollen per EU-Recht verwertbar gemacht werden.</p>



<p>Zur Ausarbeitung des Überwachungsplans hatte die EU-Kommission bereits konkrete Vorschläge beigesteuert, wie sich aus zwei von den Piraten erlangten Präsentationen ergibt. Vorgeschlagen wird eine gesetzliche Regelung zum Zugang zu verschlüsselten Geräten, die “erwiesenermaßen ausschließlich zu krimineller Kommunikation” genutzt werden. Hersteller wie Apple sollen gezwungen werden, beim Knacken der Verschlüsselung beschlagnahmter Geräte zu helfen.<a href="https://fragdenstaat.de/anfrage/documents-of-the-hlg-on-access-to-data-for-effective-law-enforcement-and-of-its-sub-groups/908533/anhang/document20-highlevelgrouponaccesstodataforeffectivelawenforcement-3rdmeetingofworkinggroup1-presentationcom.pdf">[1]</a> Auch die Wiedereinführung eines europaweiten Zwangs zur Vorratsdatenspeicherung schlägt die Behörde von EU-Innenkommissarin „Big Sister“ Johansson vor.<a href="https://fragdenstaat.de/anfrage/documents-of-the-hlg-on-access-to-data-for-effective-law-enforcement-and-of-its-sub-groups/908533/anhang/document21-highlevelgrouponaccesstodataforeffectivelawenforcement-3rdmeetingofworkinggroup2-presentationcom.pdf">[2]</a> Das deutsche Nein zur Vorratsdatenspeicherung würde dadurch ausgehebelt.</p>



<p>„Diese geheime Wunschliste der EU-Regierungen hat erfahrungsgemäß die besten Chancen, nach der Europawahl von der nächsten EU-Kommission unter ‚Big Sister‘ von der Leyen eilfertig umgesetzt zu werden“, warnt der Europaabgeordnete der Piratenpartei Dr. Patrick Breyer. „Schließlich will sie mithilfe der Regierungschefs an der Macht bleiben. Dieser extreme Überwachungsplan darf schon deshalb nicht Wirklichkeit werden, weil er von einer völlig einseitig besetzten, ohne echte Transparenz und demokratische Legitimation arbeitenden Geheimgruppe von Überwachungsfanatikern ausgekocht worden ist. Wir Piraten sagen diesem Geheimplan den Kampf an und fordern von der Leyen auf, sich von ihm und auch den jetzt bekannt gewordenen Vorschlägen ihrer eigenen Innenkommissarin zu distanzieren!</p>



<p>Wer unser Recht auf sichere Verschlüsselung angreift, attackiert nicht nur unser gerichtlich verbrieftes Recht auf Privatsphäre, sondern auch den Wirtschaftsstandort Europa. Einen Zugang zu ‚ausschließlich kriminell‘ genutzten verschlüsselten Smartphones zu erzwingen, würde unsere Smartphones allgemein auslesbar und unsicher machen. Die geplante Internet-Vorratsdatenspeicherung droht unser Recht auf Anonymität im Netz zu zerstören, das Kriminalitätsvorbeugung durch anonyme Beratung und Seelsorge, Opferhilfe durch anonyme Selbsthilfeforen und auch Investgativjournalismus ermöglicht, der oft auf anonyme Hinweisgeber angewiesen ist.”</p>



<p>Die Spitzenkandidatin der Piratenpartei zur Europawahl und Digitalexpertin Anja Hirschel kommentiert: „Die going-dark Pläne sind ein nie dagewesener, maßloser Sprung direkt in eine vollüberwachte Gesellschaft. Alles was wir tun, wohin wir uns bewegen und mit wem wir kommunizieren soll jederzeit und ohne Schranken einsehbar werden. Die Überwacher selbst bleiben dabei lieber im Dunkeln. Das dürfen wir nicht zulassen!“</p>

<p>The post shows how a PDF can be created from data in an ASP.NET Core backend and downloaded using an API. The data could be loaded from different locations and exported then as a PDF or a docx or whatever you require.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCoreCreatePdf">https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCoreCreatePdf</a></p>



 Why GemBox? 



<p>There are many different tools to generate PDF all with advantages and disadvantages. I required a tool to download PDFs created in an ASP.NET Core backend using data from a database. This was recommended to me and after trying this out, I think this is a good choice. <a href="https://www.gemboxsoftware.com/document">GemBox.document</a> has a good licensing model, it is simple to use and it provides PDF signing. You can create different formats direct from C# data classes. It is easy to use and does not require a windows host environment.</p>



 Import the GemBox Nuget package 



<p>The <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/GemBox.Document/">GemBox.Document</a> Nuget package is added to project and you have everything you require.</p>







<p></p>



<p>Note:</p>



<p>If deploying to Linux, add the HarfBuzzSharp.NativeAssets.Linux Nuget package as well.</p>



 Create an API to download PDF/Docx 



<p>The download controller is used as the public API. This class has two methods, one for downloading the data as a PDF and a second method to download the same data as a docx file.</p>


  public class DownloadController(DocumentService _documentService) : ControllerBase
{
  [Route("pdf/{id}")]
  [HttpGet]
  public FileStreamResult DownloadPdf(string id)
  {
    var stream = _documentService.GeneratePdf(id);
    return File(stream, "application/pdf");
  }

  [Route("docx/{id}")]
  [HttpGet]
  public FileStreamResult DownloadDocx(string id)
  {
    var stream = _documentService.GenerateDocx(id);
    return File(stream, 
     "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document");
  }
}
  


<p></p>



<p>The Document service class implements the document specification. This service uses data from a C# DTO and creates a GemBox document which can be exported to many different formats.</p>



<p></p>


  using GemBox.Document;

namespace ApiCreatePdf;

public class DocumentService
{

public Stream GeneratePdf(string id)
{
    var documentData = GetDocumentData(id, SaveOptions.PdfDefault);
    
    var pdf = new MemoryStream();
    var document = CreateDocument(documentData);

    document.Save(pdf, SaveOptions.PdfDefault);

    return pdf;
}

public Stream GenerateDocx(string id)
{
    var documentData = GetDocumentData(id, SaveOptions.DocxDefault);

    var docx = new MemoryStream();
    var document = CreateDocument(documentData);

    document.Save(docx, SaveOptions.DocxDefault);

    return docx;
}

private static DocumentModel CreateDocument(DocumentData documentData)
{
    // If using the Professional version, put your serial key below.
    ComponentInfo.SetLicense("FREE-LIMITED-KEY");

    var document = new DocumentModel();

    var section = new Section(document);
    document.Sections.Add(section);

    // Main text 
    var paragraph = new Paragraph(document);
    section.Blocks.Add(paragraph);
    var run = new Run(document, documentData.MainContentText);
    paragraph.Inlines.Add(run);

    var bookmarkName = "TopOfDocument";

    document.Sections.Add(
        new Section(document,
            new Paragraph(document,
                new BookmarkStart(document, bookmarkName),
                new Run(document, "This is a 'TopOfDocument' bookmark."),
                new BookmarkEnd(document, bookmarkName)),
            new Paragraph(document,
                new Run(document, "The following is a link to "),
                new Hyperlink(document, "https://www.gemboxsoftware.com/document", "GemBox.Document Overview"),
                new Run(document, " page.")),
             new Paragraph(document,
                new SpecialCharacter(document, SpecialCharacterType.PageBreak),
                new Run(document, "This is a document's second page."),
                new SpecialCharacter(document, SpecialCharacterType.LineBreak),
                new Hyperlink(document, bookmarkName, "Return to 'TopOfDocument'.") { IsBookmarkLink = true })));

    return document;
}

private DocumentData GetDocumentData(string id, SaveOptions docType)
{
    return new DocumentData
    {
        MainContentText = $"{docType.ContentType} created for id: {id}"
    };
}

}
  


<p></p>



 Downloading files  



<p>When the application is started, a PDF or a docx file can be downloaded and opened. the data can come from the database or anywhere. This is just a demo and when using data from user inputs and returning it to the clients, the data needs to be validated and sanitized.</p>

<p>👋 Hi, this is Gergely with a subscriber-only issue of the Pragmatic Engineer Newsletter. In every issue, I cover challenges at Big Tech and startups through the lens of engineering managers and senior engineers. To get articles like this in your inbox, every week, subscribe:</p><p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/subscribe?">Subscribe now</a></p><p>In March, Cognition Labs <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/142616988/is-the-ai-developera-threat-to-jobs-or-a-marketing-stunt">grabbed</a> software engineers’ attention by announcing “Devin,” what it called the “world’s first AI software engineer,” with the message that it set a new standard as a <a href="https://www.swebench.com/">SWE-bench coding benchmark</a>. As of today, Devin is closed source and in private beta, so we don’t know how it works, and most people cannot access it.</p><p>Luckily for us, the team behind the SWE-bench benchmark has open sourced an AI agent-based “coding assistant” that performs comparably on this benchmark as Devin did. Their solution is <a href="https://github.com/princeton-nlp/SWE-agent">SWE-agent</a>, which solution solves 12.5% of the tickets in this benchmark correctly, fully autonomously (this is about 4x of what the best LLM-only model performed at.) SWE-agent was built in 6 months by a team of 7 people at Princeton University, in the US. The team also publishes research papers about their learnings, alongside it being open source.</p><p>In today’s issue, we talk with <a href="https://ofir.io/about/">Ofir Press</a>, a postdoctoral research fellow at Princeton, and former visiting researcher at Meta AI and MosaicML. He’s also one of SWE-agent’s developers. In this article, we cover:</p>  <p>The Agent-Computer-Interface. The ACI (Agent-Computer Interface) concept is a key building block of SWE-Agent. AI coding agent approaches are likely to become dominant in “AI coding” solutions as they always perform better than raw LLMs.</p>  <p>How does SWE-agent work? Built with Python, it follows prompts provided and browses files, edits them, runs edits, and submits solutions.</p>  <p>Successful runs and failed ones. The fewer “turns” that an agent takes to solve an issue, the more likely it succeeds at doing so. Meanwhile, common reasons for failure include getting stuck on what to do, suggesting incorrect implementations, and not locating files containing buggy code to fix.</p>  <p>Security &amp; ethical concerns. Production changes that result in problems like data loss is a concern, as are bad actors instructing agents to generate malicious code. Knowing these issues can help all AI agents to better defend against threats.</p>  <p>Human devs vs AI agents. Some similarities, like approaches to bug fixing, and many differences, such as an agent’s inability to say “no.”</p>  <p>Next steps for SWE-agents. Fine tuning agents, debugging capabilities and auto-generating environment setup scripts?</p>  <p>Learnings from “v1” AI agents. AI agents look like the next hot area in developer tooling, but will autonomous agents ever outgrow their status as a developer’s sidekick – even with flashy demos? We’re doubtful, at least right now.</p>  <p>Before starting, a word of appreciation to the Princeton team for building <a href="https://www.swebench.com/">SWE-bench</a>, already an industry-standard AI coding assessment evaluation toolset, and for releasing their industry-leading AI coding tool, SWE-agent, as open source. Also, thanks for publishing a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15793">paper on SWE-agent and ACI interfaces.</a> Also, a shout out to everyone building these tools in the open; several are listed at the end of section 2, “How does SWE-agent work?”</p> 1. The Agent-Computer-Interface <p>SWE-agent is a tool that takes a GitHub issue as input, and returns a pull request as output, which is the proposed solution. SWE-agent currently uses GPT-4-Turbo under the hood, through API calls. As the solution is open source, it’s easy enough to change the large language model (LLM) used by the solution to another API, or even a local model; like how the Cody coding assistant by Sourcegraph can be configured to use different LLMs.</p><p>Agent-Computer Interface (ACI) is an interface for large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT to work in an LLM-friendly environment.&nbsp;</p><p>The team took inspiration from human-computer interaction (HCI) studies, where humans “communicate” with computers via interfaces that make sense, like a keyboard. In turn, computers communicate “back” via interfaces which humans can understand, like a computer screen. The AI agent also uses a similar type of interface when it communicates with a computer:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F41e64538-5b8b-4866-98a5-55022dbf341d_1120x352.png">    </a>The ACI interface can be seen as an API for the agent and a computer to communicate with. Source: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.15793">SWE-agent paper</a> <p>Let’s go through how the ACI works from semantic and structural points of view.</p> ACI from the LLM point of view <p>A good way to conceive of an agent is as a pre-configured LLM session with specialized tooling:</p>  <p>System message: The LLM session is set up with a system message that reads: “You are an autonomous programmer, and you're working directly in the command line with a special interface.” This defines the agent's behavior and context for the conversation.</p>  <p>Environment: This is what the agent interacts with. It’s usually a command line interface that takes inputs from the agent defined as commands, and shares outputs.&nbsp;</p>  <p>History: the agent tracks the history of commands, and the amount of history which can be configured. It’s worth keeping some history in place to avoid the agent repeating itself.</p>   <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8a00610-3143-43c8-b2b9-7c42c7f71696_1600x999.png">    </a>The ACI from the language model (LM) point of view  <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa0709529-4c62-4de3-a3fd-dbc66484d251_1600x714.png">    </a>ACI interface in action: SWE-agent (the “pre-configured LLM”) gives commands to the environment, it then reads output from the environment, and chooses the next step <p>The full system message is about 800 words long, and includes all system commands the LLM can execute.&nbsp;</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F91e7f83c-e1d9-4b4b-949a-f466129369e7_1272x920.png">    </a>An excerpt from the SWE-agent system message. Read <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gBlOOHQlLcPBETXHPJRyHK1YxfeC8py9s189hsmpAvI/edit">the full prompt here</a>.  ACI from a software component point of view <p>The ACI consists of these “software building blocks”:</p>  <p>A set of custom commands which the agent can run, with documentation on how to use these commands, like “edit,” “open,” etc.</p>  <p>Linter. This indents the output generated by the agent to ensure the correct formatting of commands, code, scripts, and anything else generated. The linter needs to be configured for the language(s) used.</p>  <p>Feedback about commands. The output of the commands needs to be described back to the agent. This means more than just “piping” the output of the command line. Feedback like “the command ran just fine and there was no output” must be written explicitly in order for the agent to process it. An empty string for a successful output is hard for LLMs to parse.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Specialized terminal. This terminal lets the agent see 100 lines of code within a file, at the time. The agent can instruct to move up or down the file. Why 100 lines? The agent seems to get overwhelmed and produce worse results when there’s more. Interestingly, humans also work like this, except we don’t have more than 50-100 lines of code on our screen at a given time!</p>  <p>Context: Information such as which file is open and the working directory. This information is conveyed with each command to the agent.</p>   <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3a30cdb-ccda-4c09-bd47-aabc3e8aa297_1600x895.png">    </a>The ACI from a software components point of view <p>Configuring the ACI is easy enough in the case of SWE-bench:</p>  <p>Prompt templates: initial instructions, the task itself, and a description of which tools and APIs the agent can access</p>  <p>Command files: the scripts and functions the agent can use.</p>  <p>Control flow: the environment that parses the agent’s responses and history.</p>  <p>Environment variables and initial values: factors that influence the terminall or commands, and need to be set up ahead of time.</p>   Guiding the ACI with instructions <p>Before executing commands, additional tips are given to the SWE-agent ACI. These are likely scenarios in which the agent struggled in the past, and the tips to compensate for this. Here are some examples of tips, from SWE-agent’s additional prompts:</p>  <p>Check your work: “Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discuss [...] When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.”</p>  <p>Try something else: “If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!”</p>  <p>Jump, don’t scroll: “If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.”</p>  <p>Search: “If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that.”</p>  <p>Be aware of where the working directory is: “Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory!”</p>  <p>Pay attention! “When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number, or to write code with incorrect indentation.”</p>  <p>Amusingly, these instructions could be for an inexperienced human dev learning about a new command line environment!</p> 2. How does SWE-agent work? <p>SWE-agent is an implementation of the ACI model. Here’s how it works:</p><p>1. Take a GitHub issue, like a bug report or a feature request. The more refined the description, the better.</p><p>2. Get to work. The agent kicks off, using the issue as input, generating output for the environment to run, and then repeating it.</p><p>Note that SWE-agent was built without interaction capabilities at this step, intentionally. However, you can see it would be easy enough for a human developer to pause execution and add more context or instructions.</p><p>In some way, GitHub Copilot Workspaces provides a more structured and interactive workflow. We previously covered <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-pulse-92">how GH Copilot Workspace works</a>.</p><p>3. Submit the solution. The end result could be:</p>  <p>A pull request, ready for a developer to review</p>  <p>A report of the work</p>  <p>The trajectory of the run. Trajectory refers to the full history log of the run.</p>  <p>It usually takes the agent about 10 “turns” to reach the point of attempting to submit a solution.</p><p>Running SWE-agent is surprisingly easy because the team added support for a “one-click deploy,” using GitHub Codespaces. This is a nice touch, and it’s good to see the team making good use of this cloud development environment (CDE.) We previously covered <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/cloud-development-environments-why-now">the popularity of CDEs</a>, including <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/cloud-development-environment-vendors">GitHub Codespaces</a>.</p><p>A prerequisite for using SWE-agent is an OpenAI API key, so that the agent can make API requests to use ChatGPT-4-Turbo. Given the tool is open source, it’s easy enough to change these calls to support another API, or even talk with a local LLM.</p><p>Keep in mind that while SWE-agent is open source, it costs money to use GitHub Codespace and OpenAI APIs, as is common with LLM projects these days. The cost to run a single test is around $2 per GitHub issue.</p> Technology <p>SWE-agent is written in Python, and this first version provides support for solving issues using it. The team chose this language for practical reasons: the agent was designed to score highly on the SWE-bench benchmark. And most SWE-bench issues are in Python. At the same time, SWE-agent already performs well enough with other languages.</p><p>The SWE-agent team already proved that adding support for additional languages works well. They ran a test on the <a href="https://github.com/bigcode-project/octopack">HumanEvalFix</a> benchmark, which has a range of problems in multiple languages (Python, JS, Go, Java, C++ and Rust,) that are much more focused on debugging and coding directly, not locating and reproducing an error. Using its current configuration, the agent performed well on Javascript, Java and Python problems.</p><p>Adding support for new languages requires these steps:</p>  <p>Specifying the language-specific linter to use.</p>  <p>Updating context instructions to emphasize what to pay attention to, in that language. For example, brackets are important in some languages, but indentation isn’t.</p>  <p>Ofir – a developer of SWE-agent – summarizes:</p><blockquote><p>“It wouldn't be much work to add linters for other languages and have the bot program in other languages. None of the architecture of the agent is Python-specific.”</p></blockquote> What the agent usually does <p>In the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15793">SWE-agent paper</a>, the researchers visualized what this tool usually does during each turn, while trying to resolve a GitHub issue:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b2d2f00-840e-493d-b8a4-ff95fe4c6321_1538x970.png">    </a>Steps the agent usually took at each turn. Source: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15793">SWE-agent paper</a> <p>Frequently, the agent created new files, search files, and directories early in the process, and began to edit files and run solutions from the second or third turn. Over time, most runs submitted a solution at around turn 10. Agents that didn’t submit a solution by turn 10 usually kept editing and running the files, until giving up.</p><p>Looking across all the agent’s actions, it mostly edits open files:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F312ab7bf-573f-4107-ae4a-49a32e4614ff_1162x786.png">    </a>Distributions of types of actions by the agent during each turn. Source: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15793">SWE-agent paper</a> <p>From turn one, the dominant action is for the agent to edit a file, then run Python to check if the change works as expected.</p><p>The linter makes SWE-agent work a lot better. 51.7% of edits had at least one error, which got caught by the linter, allowing the agent to correct it. This number feels like it could be on-par with how a less experienced engineer would write code. Experienced engineers tend to have good understandings of the language, and if they make errors that result in linting errors, it’s often deliberate.</p> Team behind SWE-agent <p>With companies raising tens or hundreds of millions of dollars in funding to compete in this field, it’s interesting to look at the small team from within academia that built SWE-agent in 6 months – with only two full-time members:</p>  <p>A research assistant due to start their PhD at Stanford this fall: <a href="https://john-b-yang.github.io/">John Yang</a></p>  <p>Three PhD students (3rd, 4th, 5th years): <a href="https://www.carlosejimenez.com/">Carlos E. Jimenez</a>, <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~awettig/">Alexander Wettig</a>, and <a href="https://ysymyth.github.io/">Shunyu Yao</a>, who graduated a few weeks ago – congratulations to him</p>  <p>A Princeton faculty member: <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~karthikn/">Karthik Narasimhan</a> (assistant professor)</p>  <p>A postdoc researcher: <a href="https://ofir.io/about/">Ofir Press</a>&nbsp;</p>  <p>A research engineer: <a href="https://www.lieret.net/">Kilian Lieret</a></p>  <p>Led by John Yang and Carlos E. Jimenez, everyone on the team has been active in the machine learning research field for years. And it’s worth noting that only John and Carlos worked full-time on SWE-agent, as everyone had other academic duties. The team started work in October 2023 and published the initial version in April 2024.</p><p>Building such a useful tool with a part-time academic team is seriously impressive, so congratulations to all for this achievement.</p> A note on SWE-bench <p>The team started to build SWE-agent after the core of team members had released the SWE-bench evaluation framework in October 2023. The SWE-bench collection is now used as the state-of-the-art LLM coding evaluation framework. We asked Ofir how the idea for this evaluation package came about:</p><blockquote><p>“Carlos [E. Jimenez] and John [Yang] came up with the idea for SWE-bench. It was the result of them wanting to build a challenging benchmark for evaluating the coding ability of LMs, and them noticing that GitHub issues could be a super useful resource for this.”</p></blockquote><p>SWE-bench mostly contains GitHub issues that use Python, and it feels like there’s a bias towards issues using the Django framework. We asked Ofir how this Python and Django focus came about:</p><blockquote><p>“We choose Python just to make the whole thing easier to set up and run. Django issues being heavily represented did not happen on purpose: it just happened that many of the Django GitHub issues passed our filtering process.”</p></blockquote> Open source alternatives to SWE-agent <p>This article covers SWE-agent, but other open source approaches in the AI space are available.&nbsp;</p><p>Notable projects with academic backing:</p>  <p><a href="https://github.com/nus-apr/auto-code-rover">AutoCodeRover</a>: built by a team at the National University of Singapore, using two agents, instead of the one used by SWE-agent</p>  <p><a href="https://github.com/geekan/MetaGPT">MetaGPT</a>: a focus on multiple agents.

  I'm at European Identity Conference (EIC) this week. I haven't been for several years.

I haven't been for several years. One thing that has struck me is how much of the conversation is about decentralized identity and verifiable credentials. I can remember when the whole idea of decentralized identity was anathema here. Today, the main keynote, by Martin Kuppinger himself is Vision 2030: Rethinking Digital Identity in the Era of AI and Decentralization. And all he's talking about is decentralized identity and how it's at the core of solving long standing identity problems. Another data point: Steve McCown and Kim Hamilton-Duffy ran a session this morning called Decentralized Identity Technical Mastery which was a hands-on workshop. It was in a big room and it was packed.</p><p>This truly feels like a tipping point to me. At IIW, it's identity geeks talking with other identity geeks, so it's no surprise to see lots of discussion about new things. EIC is a different kind of conference. There are about 1000 people here I'd guess. Most of them aren't working on new standards or open source projects. Instead they're the folks from companies who come to conferences like EIC to learn how to solve the problems their organization is facing.</p><p>In the keynotes and in numerous sessions, the message that they're hearing is "decentralized identity will solve your problems." Martin closed his talk with the proclamation that "decentralized identity is the new paradigm for identity." </p>

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/infrastructure/53764589985/in/album-72177720317536176/"></a>These are the men who strung and assembled the cables that hold up the George Washington Bridge roadway. After this was shot, on July 25, 1929, the cable bundles were compressed, sheathed, and draped with suspension cables to the new roadway that would be built below over the next few months. The photo is from the collection of Allen H. Searls, the gap-toothed guy with a big grin at the center of the photo. He was 21 at the time.
<p>My father, <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/docsearls/albums/72157627459297180/">Allen H. Searls</a>, was an archivist. Not a formal one, but good in the vernacular, at least when it came to one of the most consequential things he did in his life: helping build the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington_Bridge">George Washington Bridge</a>. He did this by photographing his work and fellow workers. He shot with a Kodak camera, and then developed and printed each shot, and assembled them into an album that survives to this day. All the shots in <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/infrastructure/albums/72177720317536176/">this collection</a> are from that album. I’ve archived them in <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/infrastructure/">my Flickr site focused on infrastructure</a>. I have also <a href="http://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a> licensed them to require only attribution. (Though I’d rather people credit Allen H. Searls than his son.)</p>
<p>Only two of the photos are dated. One is July 25, 1929, when workers and families celebrated the completion of the cable stringing operation. The other is July 25, 1930, presumably when the roadway was completed. I was able to piece together the significance of these dates, and guess at the date ranges of other pictures, by doing a deep dive into the New York Times archive (where I found that these guys were called “bridgemen”), and by reading my father’s copy of the <a href="https://www.roeblingmuseum.org/about">Roebling Cable</a> company’s book about how the bridge’s cables were made and put in place.</p>
<p>As we know now, almost too well, we live in an Age of AI, when the entire corpus of the Internet, and God only knows what else, has been ingested into large language models that are trained and programmed to answer questions about what they “know” (even though they don’t, really). Meanwhile what do we, as human beings, actually know? Or, better yet, where can we find what we need or want to know? Libraries of the physical kind are necessary but insufficient when our instruments of inquiry are entirely electronic. The World Wide Web has turned into the <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2024/05/02/world-wide-whiteboard/">World Wide Whiteboard</a>.</p>
<p>We need electronic archives. Simple as that.</p>
<p>We all know (and, I hope, appreciate) the Internet Archive. I was going to give my father’s copy of the Roebling book to the Archive for scanning, but discovered <a href="https://archive.org/details/RoeblingCablesForTheHudsonRiverBridgeProblemsAndRequirements/mode/2up">it’s already there</a>! That made the book easy to read (here on this flat screen), and saved my own fragile copy from further damage.</p>
<p>A heroic example of one person’s work to save the whole corpus of literature on broadcasting is David Gleason’s <a href="https://www.worldradiohistory.com/">World Radio History site</a>, without which much knowledge of broadcasting history would be lost.</p>
<p>On the contemporary front, <a href="https://bsquarebulletin.com/">Dave Askins</a>‘ work toward <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2024/03/19/the-online-local-chronicle/">online local news chronicles</a> may prove essential if we don’t want to see current and future news disappear down the same holes into which too many past publications’ work has fallen (or remains alive but trapped behind paywalls).</p>
<p>For more on where this might go, see my <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2024/04/21/archives-as-commons/">Archives as Commons</a> post. I’ll be talking about this, I hope, at the upcoming <a href="https://wow.indiana.edu/">WoW Conference</a> and <a href="https://dwebcamp.org/">DWeb Camp</a>.</p>

<p>ヨーロッパ最大のデジタルアイデンティティに関するカンファレンス、EIC (European Identity and Cloud Conference) 2024が、今年もベルリンのbcc Berlin Congress Centerで開催されます。1500人以上が集まり、EUデジタルアイデンティティウォレットをはじめ、様々なアイデンティティ関連のトピックについて議論が行われます。</p>



<p>私は、初日の夕方という最も注目を集める時間帯に、Danube TechのMarkus Sabbadello (Decentralized Identiy Foundation 理事）と共に、「Les Miserables of the Cyber Frontier: The Dueling Narratives of Decentralized Identities」（仮訳：サイバー・フロンティアのレ・ミゼラブル: 分散型アイデンティティの対立する物語）というタイトルでキーノートスピーチを行います。このタイトルは主催者によって決められたもので、どんな話になるかは当日のお楽しみという新たな試みです。</p>

<p>実はこのセッション、もともとは昨年行った「<a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/HziNa-RUA4A?t=715s">分散の誤謬</a>（<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cddx83R0jos">Falacy of Decentralisation</a>）」について、Markusが解決策を提示する場として企画されました。しかし、カンファレンスのコンテンツ責任者であるJoerg Reschに、別のコンテキストとして「無常社会と番号制度（The Miserable Society and the Identity System）」というネタがあると話したところ、彼がそのタイトルを気に入ったため、内容はそのままにタイトルが変更されることになったのです。</p>



<p>内容は「Markus SabbadelloとNat Sakimura、デジタルアイデンティティの先駆者たちによる対談。今日の『分散型』プロジェクトは本当にどれほど分散化されているのでしょうか？ここに至るまでの経緯は？そして、ここからどこへ向かうのでしょうか？」といったもので、私たち二人の対談を通じて、現在の分散型プロジェクトの現状と今後の展望について探っていきます。</p>



<p>先週の木曜日に行ったざっくりとした打ち合わせの中で、Markusが「んで、タイトル回収、どうする…？」と問いかけた場面もあり、果たしてどのような内容になるのか、今から楽しみです。</p>



<p>トークの時間と場所は：</p>



 
 タイトル：Les Miserables of the Cyber Frontier: The Dueling Narratives of Decentralized Identities 



 時間　　：2024年6月4日（火） 19:10—19:30 



 場所　　：bcc Berlin Congress Center メインホール (C 01) 
 



<p>当日、どのような展開になるのか、ぜひご期待ください。</p>

<p>Good morning from Little Rock! It’s been a week of emotional ups and downs. Even as I’ve been pounding the pavement to find a new home, I’ve embarked on some exhilarating explorations with Stephers and Washington Sean around wearables, managed “wellness,” blockchain digital twins, tech billionaire-founded “smart” Montessori schools, forest intelligence, micro-myco biomes, photons, quantum entanglement, metabolism, tardigrades (moss bears), substrate-independent fractal group minds, radiation, desiccation, resonant information fields, and water memory in the context of the “Three Body Problem,” Liu Cixin’s novel recently remade as a Netflix series. </p>
<p>I keep trying to focus and put my thoughts together, but have thus far only succeeded in compiling an hour or so of clips (Oops, look at that, now it’s three hours – shocker!) that outline the contours of our thinking, still in progress. Consider them video “notes.” I suspect without commentary it may be difficult for others to follow, but I’ll share the video below for curious ones who may want to wade into the flow of emergent, coalescing conjectures and have a look around. Hopefully in the next week I’ll be able to sort through our voluminous text thread and map out the concepts well enough to do a structured overview of our expanded thinking on the situation in which we find ourselves.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I texted Stephers, after a particularly fruitful exchange, that people are going to have a hard time keeping up. It was a comment with a bittersweet edge. I don’t mean to imply people are slow or ignorant. It’s just that our merry band has ventured far off into uncharted territory, and few are prepared to extend themselves past comfortable / comforting narratives. Beyond there be dragons and all that…</p>
<p>I experienced this with my own family, an ongoing heart break. You changed, you do research, you left us…was the refrain. Even though I was always right there in the living room. Yes, I was in the living room, but the information that surrounded me was…different. I wasn’t the NPR-listening mom I used to be. I followed the money. I saw patterns. I built my own understanding of what I sensed was unfolding. I wanted to know more, and in that quest I realized, too late, I had isolated myself from my former life with terrible finality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The work I’ve done in partnership with fellow travelers; pulling threads, making maps, uncovering connections, and weaving a tapestry that continues to challenge everything I thought I knew about the world, gradually pushed me to the margins. Over time, it led to my painful cancellation as a daughter, wife, mother, and friend even as it has opened doors to productive new collaborations and adventures in new lands. I continue to grapple with that reality alone here in this efficiency apartment, awaiting my next chapter. Despite persistent, ineffectual, attempts to build bridges back to my loved ones, the vast chasms, for the moment at least, seem like they will not be overcome.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is an ongoing refrain running in the back of my mind…Meg facing off against IT… “you are not my Charles Wallace.” </p>
<p>But also, “love wins.”</p>
<p>While touring homes this week, my realtor commiserated with me. </p>
<p>Yes, Covid, whatever it was, changed everything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are all brain-boxed to varying degrees. It’s challenging to integrate information we’re not socialized to see, have no context to see, into an updated world view. As a researcher, I freely offer questioners maps of my thinking with copious source material. I cannot, however, compel anyone to dive in and explore. Even with a framework that contextualizes my thought process laid out for consideration, learning a new landscape takes time; and that is bandwidth people may not have.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They may not want to make an investment in a journey that could result in them being jettisoned from their life, as I have been from mine. There are no shortcuts to getting familiar enough with a new lens that you can try it on and look at things from different angles to see if it works for you. And at the end of the day, few people want to put hours, days, weeks, or even years of effort into deconstructing the stories inside which they live. Because you risk being left standing out on your own, ideologically, emotionally, spiritually naked. Only those who are prepared to embark on an uncertain journey take that first step. No judgment. It’s just the way it is. We’re not all the same, and that’s ok. Not everyone is here to walk the same road. Blockchained or not, we are endowed with agency and the capacity to make choices. </p>
<p>Choose, pause, reflect, and choose again.</p>
<p>My intelligence forays keep looping me back to education, my starting point, particularly early childhood “education,” the centerpiece of the emerging social impact finance landscape. Each time I “level up” into an expanded understanding of this complex “game” I find myself revisiting work I’ve done before in a new light. I’ve been thinking about Montessori education melded with the forest school model in the context of invisible spatial computing, digital ID, terraformed synthetic telepathy, carbon credits, an emergent GAIA noosphere, and NVIDIA’s plans to give every child an AI companion that will help manifest bring their imaginary worlds into this realm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where does Sep Kamvar fit in with Wildflower Montessori (think – Evan Baehr’s “flourishing” Learn Capital investments, Regen Network’s Web3 soil sequestration shenanigans, systems theorist Dana Klisanin and her indigenous “rewilding” of the mind, not to mention cryptographer Ian Grigg’s tokenized laminated flowers).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wildflower is gaining ground in charter micro-school franchises nationwide. Could MIT’s social computing project ultimately be paired with Celo’s “beautiful” digital community currency to manage the homeostasis of an emergent global superorganism? Are they after a network of youthful imaginary explorers, each classroom a fractal holon coordinated with token engineering and game mechanics? Will Oliver Reiser’s “won’t you be my sensor?” World Sensorium be run by the under-eight crowd, children just beginning to lose their baby teeth, their minds gradually domesticated by the printed word? Just what is this “science of reading” really about? It’s starting to feel like memetics and mind viruses melded with “personalized” AI literacy playlists of OER, EEGs, and IoT eye-tracking.</p>
<p>Kamvar speaks often about the intelligence of the forest, fungal networks, and decentralized collective intelligence. Think of communication reframed as a free market economy of underground signals – phosphorus routing through mycorrhiza and roots and soil and food and bones and around again it goes – dust to (nano?) dust…interdimensional communication…gut programming…unexpected data storage and retrieval mechanisms…hypercubes…crystal lattices navigated by entrained heart field energy…</p>
<p>Could the future of Moore’s law computing look like moss and lichen on a boulder? With the move to quantum photonics, there is a logic in putting photosynthesis front and center. I sense the system knows a sacred intelligence already exists and there is some pressure to harness, divert, and scale up nature’s secrets.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Again…for what purpose? I do not know. So please don’t ask me to stop looking and start judging, demanding I put a thumb down on the good/bad scale. That’s not who I am anymore. I don’t know enough yet to say, and ultimately I feel it is vital for each person to come to their own inner knowing of where things are headed with this Noosphere, gamified GAIA superorganism. I am more than happy to share my notes, and see yours if we are operating in the same problem space. I can’t tell you how to think about it all. It’s not my place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the past few years I’ve swapped my previously assumed roles of judge, warrior, and activist for curious scout and pattern finder. My brain and my heart are full. There exists a shrinking circle of people who share enough common ground that we can compare notes and piece together more of this puzzle. For my fellow collaborators I continue to be profoundly grateful. For whatever reason I sense it is my fate to keep walking towards the horizon, my current base of operation being Hot Springs, Arkansas (the natural state) where I’ll poke around in the corners of philosophy of mind, quantum consciousness, information theory, extremophiles, biogeochemistry, and the origins of life against a backdrop of ancient, weathered mountains, clear water, and majestic trees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An added bonus are the welcoming people here, some of whom have opened their hearts to me and seem more than happy to take a wayward Yankee under their wing and share their local wisdom of fishing, hiking, swimming holes, and t-ball.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’ll end with some photos I took on walks this past week, seeking solace in the dappled shade of my new home place. One of the reasons I chose Hot Springs was the fact that despite being just an hour’s drive from Little Rock, it is surrounded by the wild nature of the Ouachita National Forest along with generous doses of pastoral beauty. These worn-down mountains are perfect for women of a certain age, like me. I adore the mix of hardwoods and towering southern pines interspersed with glints of distant sunlight sparkling on the lake.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pics include a forest renewing itself from a devastating tornado 15 years ago, fungal decomposition, geological layers that reset one’s perception of time, cheerful rudbeckia, milky quartz, a tiny coral fungus of the most captivating purple, kids enjoying the first days of summer vacation at the lake, and a tiny heart of white pebbles!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Onward! This piece, “Portage” I saw in the riverfront sculpture garden today after grabbing some okra and squash at the farmer’s market seems to sum up the state of my life at the moment. Hopefully, I’ll be able to put my boat back in the water soon.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Die hochumstrittene verdachtslose Chatkontrolle könnte von den EU-Regierungen doch noch beschlossen werden, weil Frankreich sein bisheriges Veto aufgeben könnte. Das <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/law-enforcement/news/audio-communications-excluded-in-latest-draft-of-child-sexual-abuse-material-law/">berichtet</a> euractiv und bestätigen <a href="https://netzpolitik.org/2024/interne-dokumente-frankreich-entscheidet-ueber-zukunft-der-chatkontrolle/">interne Unterlagen</a>. Frankreich sieht den neuen Vorschlag einer „Uploadmoderation“ im Grundsatz als gangbaren Weg an.</p>



<p>Nach dem neuesten Gesetzentwurf mit Datum 28. Mai (<a href="https://netzpolitik.org/wp-upload/2024/05/2024-05-28_Council_Presidency_LEWP_CSAR_Compromise-texts_9093.pdf">Dokument 9093/24</a>), der als „Uploadmoderation“ präsentiert wird, sollen Nutzer von Apps und Diensten mit Chatfunktionen gefragt werden, ob sie das verdachtslose und fehleranfällige Scannen und gegebenenfalls Ausleiten ihrer privat verschickten Bilder, Fotos und Videos akzeptieren. Mit „künstlicher Intelligenz“ sollen auch bisher unbekannte Bilder und Videos durchleuchtet werden. Lehnt ein Nutzer die Chatkontrolle ab, soll er gar keine Bilder, Fotos, Videos oder Links mehr verschicken oder empfangen können (Artikel 10). Ende-zu-Ende-verschlüsselte Dienste müssten die Chatkontrolle durch Einbau von Überwachungsfunktionen umsetzen, die „vor der Datenübertragung“ greifen sollen (sog. client-side scanning, Artikel 10a). Auf die Durchsuchung von Textnachrichten nach Hinweisen auf „Grooming“, die auch bisher kaum zum Einsatz kommt, soll genauso verzichtet werden wie auf das noch nie eingesetzte Scannen von Sprachkommunikation. Wohl als Zugeständnis an Frankreich sollen zudem die Chats der Mitarbeiter von Sicherheitsbehörden und Militär von der Chatkontrolle ausgenommen bleiben.</p>



<p>Bei der letzten Diskussion am 24. Mai machte der Juristische Dienst des Rates deutlich, dass eine verdachtslose massenhafte Chatkontrolle weiterhin vorgesehen sei und nach wie vor grundrechtswidrig bleibe. Die meisten EU-Regierungen halten trotzdem an der Chatkontrolle fest. Schon am 4. Juni wollen die EU-Regierungen weiter beraten.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>„Der neueste Vorstoß zeigt, dass der extreme Ausgangsentwurf der EU-Kommission zur in der freien Welt einzigartigen Chatkontrolle im Kern unverändert durchgedrückt werden soll. Die ‚Upload-Moderation‘ mit vermeintlicher Nutzerzustimmung erinnert an die Fernsehshow ‚Lass dich überwachen‘. Messengerdienste rein textbasiert mit Bilder- und Linkverbot zu nutzen, ist im 21. Jahrhundert keine ernsthafte Option.</p>



<p>Es bleibt dabei: Millionen privater Chats und Privatfotos unbescholtener Bürger sollen mit unzuverlässiger Technik durchsucht und ausgeleitet werden, ohne dass die Betroffenen auch nur entfernt mit Kindesmissbrauch zu tun haben – das zerstört unser digitales Briefgeheimnis. So landen unsere Nacktfotos und Familienbilder bei Fremden, in deren Hände sie nicht gehören und bei denen sie nicht sicher sind. Trotz Lippenbekenntnissen zu Verschlüsselung soll mit Client-Side-Scanning bisher sichere Ende-zu-Ende-Verschlüsselung allgemein ausgehebelt werden, um unsere Smartphones zu Spionen umzufunktionieren – das zerstört sichere Verschlüsselung.</p>



<p>Mich alarmiert, dass das bisher kritische Frankreich die umverpackten Pläne plötzlich lobt und dadurch die bisherige Sperrminorität zu kippen droht. Wenn die EU-Regierungen tatsächlich mit dieser radikalen Position zur Chatkontrolle in die Trilogverhandlungen gehen sollten, droht das Parlament hinter verschlossenen Türen erfahrungsgemäß seine Ausgangsposition schrittweise aufzugeben und sich auf schlechte und gefährliche Kompromisse einzulassen, die unsere Sicherheit im Netz auf Spiel setzen.</p>



<p>Jetzt ist die Zeit für unser digitales Briefgeheimnis und sichere Verschlüsselung zu kämpfen!“</p>
Dr. Patrick Breyer, Europaabgeordneter der Piratenpartei</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<p>„Nicht nur das eigentliche Ziel, auch der Zeitpunkt ist alarmierend. Genau jetzt, mitten im Endspurt des Wahlkampfes und in der anschließenden Phase, in der sich neu gewählte Abgeordnete erst zurechtfinden müssen, solch ein Tempo vorzulegen zeigt, worum es eigentlich geht. Den scheinbar schwächsten Moment des Parlamentes auszunutzen um diese demokratiegefährdenden Überwachungsphantasien Realität werden zu lassen. Ich bin entsetzt.”</p>
Anja Hirschel, Informatikerin und Spitzenkandidatin der Piratenpartei zur Europawahl</blockquote>

The abstract was:</p>
 
 Standards are about making choices. When building machines, we take for granted being able to use nuts, bolts, wires, light bulbs, and countless other parts made to industry standards. Standards contain choices about dimensions of screw threads, nut sizes, etc., enabling a marketplace of interoperable parts from multiple suppliers. Without these choices, every part would be custom-manufactured. The same is true of the identity and security standards we use to build the Identity Engine. However, the identity and security standards at our disposal differ wildly in the degree to which they do and don’t make choices. Some consistently define ONE way to do things, resulting in everyone doing it that way (interoperability!). Others leave critical choices unmade, passing the buck to implementers and applications (your mileage may vary). In this talk, I’ll name names and take prisoners, critiquing existing and emerging standards through the lens of the choices they made and failed to make. Hold on to your hats as we examine the pros and cons of the choices made by OAuth, SAML, X.509, OpenID Connect, Verifiable Credentials, DIDs, WebCrypto, JOSE, COSE, and many others through this lens! I believe you’ll agree with me that making choices matters. 
 
<p>The audience was highly engaged by the process of giving existing and emerging standards letter grades based on the choices they made (or failed to make)!</p>

But don’t go there yet (if you haven’t already). What I ended up using there is a punchline at the end of the dialog that starts here—</p>
<p>Me:&nbsp;A vast field on which the ground spells the letters A and I, with people on it, having a good time.</p>
<p>ChatGPT:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here’s the illustration of a whimsical outdoor scene with a vast field shaped into the letters ‘A’ and ‘I’, where people are enjoying various activities, creating a cheerful and lively atmosphere.</p>
<p>Me:&nbsp;Make the two letters upper case A and upper case I, both with serifs.</p>
<p>ChatGPT:&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here’s the updated illustration of a vast field shaped into the uppercase letters ‘A’ and ‘I’, both with serifs, where people are enjoying a sunny day outdoors. The setting is lively and festive, enhancing the creative landscape.</p>
<p>Me:&nbsp;Those are not the letters A or I, and lack serifs. Try again, with A on the left, and I on the right.</p>
<p>ChatGPT:&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here’s the updated illustration showing a vast field shaped into the uppercase serif letters ‘A’ and ‘I’, with ‘A’ on the left and ‘I’ on the right. The field is vibrant and bustling with people enjoying various outdoor activities.</p>
<p>Me: Better, but there is no I on the right.</p>
<p>ChatGPT:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here’s the updated illustration showing a vast field clearly shaped into the uppercase serif letters ‘A’ and ‘I’, with ‘A’ on the left and ‘I’ on the right. The field is lively with people engaging in various activities, set in a sunny and cheerful environment.</p>
<p>Me: That’s an interesting design, but I need an A and an I next to each other.</p>
<p>ChatGPT:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here’s the updated illustration showing the vast field clearly shaped into the adjacent uppercase serif letters ‘A’ and ‘I’. The setting is vibrant and festive, surrounded by people enjoying various activities.</p>
<p>Me:&nbsp;That’s one big A, not an A and an I. Give me both.</p>
<p>ChatGPT:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here’s the updated illustration showing a vast field clearly shaped into the uppercase serif letters ‘A’ and ‘I’, side by side. The setting is lively and festive, filled with people enjoying various activities.</p>
<p>Me: That has no serifs and is still just an A. I want an A and an I. Separate.</p>
<p>ChatGPT:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here’s the updated illustration showing a vast field clearly shaped into the uppercase serif letters ‘A’ and ‘I’, side by side. The setting is vibrant, with people enjoying various outdoor activities.</p>
<p>Me: Still not separate. That’s one big A. I want an I next to it.</p>
<p>ChatGPT:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here’s the updated illustration, clearly showing the vast field shaped into the separate uppercase serif letters ‘A’ on the left and ‘I’ on the right. The scene is lively with people enjoying various activities under a sunny sky.</p>
<p>Me: Let’s try this: An “A” and an “I” in an open field full of people.</p>
<p>ChatGPT:&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here’s the illustration showing an open field shaped into the uppercase letters ‘A’ and ‘I’, with people enjoying various activities in the area. The scene is lively and sunny, capturing a cheerful outdoor gathering.</p>
<p>Me:&nbsp;Better! Now give me the same thing, with a complete “a.”</p>
<p>ChatGPT:&nbsp; We are experiencing heavy server load. To ensure the best experience for everyone, we have rate limits in place. Please wait for 2 minutes before generating more images. Let me know if there’s anything else you’d like to discuss in the meantime!</p>
<p>Me (after a 3 minute pause):&nbsp;Thanks. Now give me the same image, but with a complete “A.”</p>
<p>ChatGPT:&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Here’s the updated illustration showing a vast open field creatively landscaped into two distinct uppercase ‘A’ letters, bustling with people enjoying various activities in a sunny, cheerful setting.</p>
<p>(Yes, it created both images.)</p>
<p>Me: Give me the same, but with people surrounding the “A” and the “I.” Also, please put serifs on the “I.”</p>
<p>ChatGPT:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here’s the updated illustration showing a vast open field creatively landscaped into the shapes of the uppercase letters ‘A’ and ‘I’, both with serifs. The field is surrounded by people enjoying various activities in a sunny, cheerful setting.</p>
<p>Me:&nbsp;Try the same, but with “a” and “i” as separate letters.</p>
<p>ChatGPT:&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here’s the updated illustration showing a vast open field creatively landscaped into the shapes of the lowercase letters ‘a’ and ‘i’. The setting is surrounded by people enjoying various activities in a sunny, cheerful atmosphere.</p>
<p>Me:&nbsp;Closer. Only now take it out of the city. I want only countryside.</p>
<p>ChatGPT:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here’s the updated illustration showing a vast open field in the countryside, creatively landscaped into the shapes of the lowercase letters ‘a’ and ‘i’. The setting is serene and picturesque, surrounded by people enjoying rural activities.</p>
<p>Me: Please make the “a” and the “i” separate.</p>
<p>ChatGPT:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here’s the updated illustration showing a vast open field in the countryside, creatively landscaped into the distinctly separated lowercase letters ‘a’ and ‘i’. The setting is serene, surrounded by people enjoying rural activities in a picturesque and peaceful outdoor gathering.</p>
<p>At this point I gave up and decided to give <a href="https://copilot.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Copilot</a> a whack—</p>
<p>Me:&nbsp;A vast field on which the ground spells the letters A and I, with people on it, having a good time.</p>
<p>Microsoft Copilot:</p>
<p></p>
<p>I decided not to push my luck, and <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2024/05/28/the-peoples-ai/">used the one on the bottom right</a>.</p>
<p>It’s fun to know I am not alone at this. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1b5l12u/oh_my_god/">Here is a brilliant video of somebody far more patient than I getting ChatGPT to spell HONDA in ASCII art</a>.</p>

<p>Programming note: this week, there will be no The Pulse on Thursday. I’m attending <a href="https://craft-conf.com/2024">Craft Conference</a> in Budapest, Hungary and delivering my annual conference talk the same day. My keynote is <a href="https://craft-conf.com/2024/talk/whats-old-is-new-again">titled “What’s Old is New Again.”</a> I’ll share the recording in the newsletter, once it will become available. I hope you enjoy this detailed deepdive on a lean and nimble startup (Bluesky) for the week!</p><p>Bluesky is a promising decentralized Twitter-alternative. Founded two years ago, the company received $13M in funding from Twitter in 2021. Today, it employs 12 software engineers, with more than 5 million users a year on from its invite-only beta launch.</p><p>Previously, we looked into the social media platform’s architecture and engineering decisions in <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/bluesky">Building Bluesky: a distributed social network (real-world engineering challenges).</a> In this article, we learn about the team and the engineering culture, covering:</p>  <p>Unusual origins. It’s rare for publicly traded companies to fund startups which may become rivals – but it happened with Bluesky.</p>  <p>Team. A high ratio of former founders amongst the engineering team (70-80!%) , and the near-absence of Big Tech experience.</p>  <p>Tech stack. TypeScript, Go, ScyllaDB, SQLite, React+Expo.</p>  <p>Company culture. Full-remote with a time zone overlap, “extremely online.”</p>  <p>How the team operates. 2-3 person teams with a DRI, work buddies for everyone, and lots of longform writing.</p>  <p>Engineering culture. Integration tests over unit tests, roll-back / roll-forward, &amp; the benefits of not having large-scale organizational expertise.</p>  <p>Open source and community. Treat contributors well, invest in developer platforms and documentation, and celebrate/promote third-party contributions.</p>  <p>By the end of this article, you’ll hopefully understand how a dozen engineers build and operate a product with such outsized impact in its millions of users and fast growth. Small but very efficient engineering teams are increasingly popular – especially with <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/zirp">the end of 0% interest rates</a> – as “efficient” software engineering teams become the norm, industry-wide.</p> 1. Unusual origins <p>Bluesky kicked off in 2019 with a now-iconic TWEET from then-Twitter CEO, Jack Dorsey.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1d6d493-5d0f-4368-a3da-7224910778f3_1092x494.png">    </a><a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1204766078468911106">This tweet</a> kicked off Bluesky <p>Potential candidates sent DMs (direct messages) to Jack, of whom around a dozen were invited to join a <a href="https://matrix.org/ecosystem/clients/">Matrix</a> chatroom, where he provided a prompt for discussing ideas, which read:</p><blockquote><p>The biggest and long term goal is to build a durable and open protocol for public conversation. That it not be owned by any one organization but contributed by as many as possible. And that it is born and evolved on the internet with the same principles.</p></blockquote><p>CEO of Bluesky, Jay Graber, was one of this small group, which also included:</p>  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremie_Miller">Jeremie Miller</a>: prolific contributor to the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) used today in apps like Whatspp, Kik Messenger, and Zoom.</p>  <p>Matthew Hodgson: technical cofounder of <a href="https://matrix.org/about/">Matrix</a>, an open protocol for decentralized, secure communications.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Ian Preston: cofounder of Peergos, a platform trying to build the “next web,” where end users are in control of their data. Also an early Twitter engineer.</p>  <p>The group was made up of heavy hitters in decentralized messaging protocols, and entrepreneurs aiming to advance and evolve the web.</p><p>In mid-2020, Jay proposed writing <a href="https://gitlab.com/bluesky-community1/decentralized-ecosystem/-/blob/master/README.md">an ecosystem review</a> of existing decentralized social networks and technologies. As this review was developed, the chatroom grew to ~60 people. By the end of 2020, Twitter put out a request for proposals in the group. Several people responded, including Jay Graber.</p><p>Twitter ran an interview process in 2021 to select the Bluesky project’s lead, and Jay was announced as the choice that August:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F92e4f019-8388-437e-bd47-9b1922de57c7_1086x654.png">    </a>Announcing Jay as lead of Bluesky, when it was unclear what the project was  A unique setup <p>Unusually, Bluesky spun up as an independent organization, not as part of Twitter. Mostly, when a company announces funding for a new initiative, it becomes an internal division of the company. But in this case, the opposite happened: Bluesky was external to and independent of Twitter from day one.</p><p>Jay used her own money to hire Daniel Holmgren and start prototyping while the details were being finalized. Together, they fleshed out a protocol Jay had coauthored with technical advisor whyrusleeping back in 2018 – a core design that persists in Bluesky to this day.</p><p>The project got the green light on 31 December 2021, when Twitter paid the newly formed entity a substantial sum of $13M to build the AT Protocol, and also the sign off for Bluesky to work fully independently. Actually, there was one condition from <a href="https://x.com/bluesky/status/1518707606881067008">Twitter</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“Twitter's funding of Bluesky is not subject to any conditions except one: that Bluesky is to research and develop technologies that enable open and decentralized public conversation.”</p></blockquote><p>It’s common for companies raising funding from investors to pursue a bold vision, but it’s extremely rare for a publicly traded company like Twitter to fund a startup and hand it a pretty much free rein. This was likely due to Jack's personal interest in the project, but also stems from Jay's conviction about what the project needed. In her own words:</p><blockquote><p>"I negotiated six months for independence because being a subsidiary of Twitter wasn't a viable option. The company moved too slowly, and I felt there was too much risk that Bluesky could be killed as a project if leadership changed. That turned out to be true."</p></blockquote><p>Jay told us that she negotiated for six months for independence because she wouldn't accept that being a subsidiary of Twitter would be a viable option. Jay felt that Twitter moved too slowly and felt there was too much risk that Bluesky could be killed as a project if Twitter’s leadership would have changed. And how true this assumption was – given how in November 2022, <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-scoop-30">Elon Musk acquired Twitter</a> and made <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-scoop-30">drastic changes</a> from the start.</p> Business model&nbsp; <p>Most VC-funded businesses in the US are limited liability companies (LLCs,) and for-profit. Not Bluesky. It’s a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benefit_corporation">Public Benefit C-Corporation</a> (PBC,) meaning its primary mission is the “public good,” not necessarily profit.</p><p>This difference could give Bluesky a slight advantage over regular for-profit companies: they don’t need to focus solely on generating returns for shareholders like publicly traded companies must, or being commercially viable straight away with a product-market fit. Instead, Bluesky could focus on the mission to “develop and drive large-scale adoption of technologies for open and decentralized public conversation.”&nbsp;</p><p>But this also comes with risk because it dodges the need to define a business strategy in the short term, even though it’s known that strategy is a big ingredient in long-term success.</p><p>We asked Bluesky about this risk. After all, why would users trust a service that could run out of cash, due to being focused on its mission, instead of making money? Here’s what the team says:</p>  <p>Different incentives from traditional social media companies. Due to the openness of Bluesky’s architecture, users are not locked in. Whether it's what client app they use or what algorithm they use for their primary feed, users can choose Bluesky’s defaults, or switch to another provider. Since the cost to switch is so low, Bluesky is incentivized to monetize in ways that will keep users happy.&nbsp; On the other hand, Twitter <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/19/23562947/twitter-third-party-client-tweetbot-twitterific-ban-rules">banned third-party clients in 2023</a>, as they didn’t serve ads.</p>  <p>Exploring paid services as value-adds. In order to not depend on external funding, Bluesky has <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/7-05-2023-business-plan">a business vision</a> to sell paid services. The first is <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/7-05-2023-business-plan">partnering with Namecheap</a> to sell custom domains, which are a big part of Bluesky. Now, when someone registers a domain through Namecheap, Bluesky gets a small commission.</p>  <p>The existing monetization strategies that traditional social media companies use, like selling user data for ads, would not be as effective for Bluesky. So, they’ll need to find new ways to monetize. An interesting observation by Bluesky’s developer relationships engineer, Emily Liu:</p><blockquote><p>“We’re using this period of time to explore what services will be valuable for users, like custom domains that users can <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/7-05-2023-namecheap">purchase and manage through Bluesky</a>. We’re turning a social app inside out — unlike the centralized social media giants, we don’t have a monopoly on user data, and so we aren’t following a super traditional monetization path.”</p></blockquote><p>There are examples of companies that became PBCs and enjoyed success, or even went public. Insurance technology startup Lemonada went public in 2020 with this setup. Education startup Coursera is also a PBC, as is the eyewear company, Warby Parker.</p> 2. Team <p>Today, Bluesky has around 40 full-time staff:</p>  <p>17 in “core” team, of which 12 are developers</p>  <p>Circa 20 people in support and moderation</p>  <p>Fun fact: none of the early hires ever worked at Twitter! (The first person hired with past experience at Twitter was brought onboard in 2024.) I find this interesting, as since Bluesky was founded, Twitter has <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-scoop-31">laid off 75% of its workforce</a> – some of whom may have considered joining the new social media startup.</p> Team structure <p>In the core engineering team, everyone is on Bluesky, and we’re linking their profiles.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Protocol/backend and infra: 5 people, working mostly in the <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto">Atproto repository</a> and <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/indigo">Indigo repo</a>. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dholms.xyz">Daniel Holmgren</a>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/divy.zone">Devin Ivy</a>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bnewbold.net">Bryan Newbold</a>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matthieu.bsky.team">Matthieu</a>, and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jaz.bsky.social">Jaz</a>.</p>  <p>Frontend &amp; apps: 5 people.

In most company deep dives, we ask current or past employees to get the team structure. But for Bluesky, you can simply inspect the projects within <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social">the Bluesky repository</a>, and map Github contributors to their Bluesky handles! All code that Bluesky engineers write is in public, and I’m somewhat surprised just how transparent this all is, in a good way.</p> Unusually high ratio of former founders <p>Close to 4/5 of the “core” team have been founders before, which is extremely unusual at a startup. Of course, startups attract people who prefer working in small teams, some of whom have also been founders. But what attracted so many to Bluesky?</p><p>From talking with the team, it comes down to:</p>  <p>Belief in Bluesky’s greater mission</p>  <p>Building decentralized web experiences&nbsp;</p>  <p>Bluesky is building a social network, to scale. If anyone knows how to rapidly scale up, it’s people at Big Tech companies with personal experience of it; think engineers at Google in the early 2000s, those at Facebook in the mid-2000s and early 2010s, those at Netflix in the 2010s, etc. But Bluesky had no such people among its first few engineering hires.</p><p>Founding engineer Paul Frazee shares:</p><blockquote><p>“A lot of the core team's experience really just came from previous decentralized web or decentralized social projects; way more than from high scale social networks.</p><p>“We had a ton of experience with peer-to-peer networks, and had paid a fair amount of attention to the blockchain world. For the initial team, this was the second, third, or even fourth time building a decentralized network.”</p></blockquote> 3. Tech stack  Typescript (almost) all the way <p>The backend is mostly in Typescript, as is the frontend and mobile apps. This allows software engineers to work across the stack without switching languages. This choice is similar to <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/86186964/technology-stack">Linear’s to use Typescript between the back and front ends</a>.</p><p>Why pick this language? Daniel Holmgren gives several reasons:</p>  <p>De facto language of the web. “Javascript and therefore Typescript is probably as close as we have to a ‘lingua franca’ for the web. We felt it was a natural choice to communicate the core ideas in the reference implementation of the protocol.”</p>  <p>Shared front and back end language. “Having a shared implementation across the client and backend makes for a nice development experience, especially knowing that both sides have a shared understanding of the schema system.”</p>  <p>Fits the AT protocol’s dynamic data approach. “Being a dynamic language, Typescript has been great for working with the dynamic data you find in the ATproto ecosystem.”&nbsp;</p>  <p>A great fit for code generation. “Typescript has a really great ecosystem for code generation. I think it's that the actual official TypeScript implementation just ships the tooling for parsing into an AST and then manipulating it and outputting code. Not many people were needing that, but I was really happy it was there.”</p>  <p>Great for prototyping with a small team. “Typescript is a great language for quick building. The runtime is quite powerful and lets you not worry (much) about things like memory management and concurrency. The type system is very ergonomic and provides the structure you need, while seldom getting in the way. With such a small early team, it made sense to choose a language that enabled us to prototype quickly.”</p>   Node.js <p>The Typescript code on the backend uses the <a href="https://nodejs.org/en">Node.js</a> runtime. One worry the team had was how it would scale, as Node.js app runs in a single thread, without creating a new thread for every request. This means a server running Node.js can handle fewer parallel requests than frameworks that support multi-threading more efficiently.</p><p>However, the team found it's very easy to scale the service horizontally (adding more machines,) but only by building the application to be stateless. They did this, and Daniel recalls they proved a point:</p><blockquote><p>“At one point, we had around 192 node processes running behind HAProxy. All these processes were super ‘bored,’ at around 1% CPU utilization. But the point is that it’s very easy to scale a stateless Node service out horizontally – so that's what we did!”</p></blockquote> Go for performance <p>The backend started out as Typescript, but over time, Go was introduced. But why bring in another language when Typescript works well enough? Performance, says Daniel:</p><blockquote><p>“Some of more infra-y services such as the Relay and our internal ‘Dataplane’ are very performance-based. They often involve a lot of crypto operations and low-level bit twiddling. These are things that Go excels at. In particular, Go has a shard-aware driver for Scylla (a database we use) which made it a natural choice for interfacing with it.”</p></blockquote><p>The team has rewritten services from Typescript to Go when performance improvements warrant it. Services in Go, today:</p>  <p>Search services like <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/indigo/blob/main/cmd/palomar/README.md">Palomar</a>.</p>  <p><a href="https://docs.bsky.app/docs/advanced-guides/firehose">The “firehose”</a> called Relay. This service does a lot of low-level fiddling and crypto operations.</p>  <p>Dataplane. This service is called the “BigSky service,” and is one of few closed-sourced services. This service manages data, talking to ScyllaDB, as well as some other data stores like Redis, and their own handwritten cache stores.</p>   Data layer: Postgres, ScyllaDB, SQLite <p>Bluesky started out with PostgreSQL as the data store, but as the load grew the team expected the time would come to move off this flexible but potentially less scalable solution, to a less flexible, more scalable one.</p><p>Migration happened in mid-2023:</p>  <p>ScyllaDB powers AppViews.</p>  <p>SQLite is the database of choice for the personal data servers (PDSses.)</p>  <p>We cover more on the data layer migration in <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/114113498/scaling-the-database-layer">Part 1: Scaling the database layer</a>.</p> Backend-to-frontend communication <p>The <a href="https://atproto.com/specs/lexicon">Lexicon schema</a> is used to describe HTTP endpoints and all of the record types in the network. This approach ensures strongly-typed contracts and agreements between backend and client.</p><p>Such strong contracts are especially important for a decentralized network. Bluesky is also an open microservices network, so being stricter at the protocol level makes sense. Paul Frazee puts it like this:</p><blockquote><p>“You can think of the entire network as an open microservices network. It's not terribly uncommon when you're doing microservices to try to systemize it through a schema language, to make sure that the contracts are being obeyed throughout all these different things, as you don't have the benefit of a monolith.”</p></blockquote> Build tooling <p>The team uses GitHub Actions for the CI/CD stack. The project is running in the open, so you can <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/actions">inspect these runs yourself</a>:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5eca81ad-3c5e-41b1-87c3-a0cf7f97ad95_1600x999.png">    </a>Recent CI/CD runs in the Bluesky protocol repository. Source: <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/actions">Bluesky</a> <p>The builds themselves use common tools and techniques for catching quality issues early:</p><p>Linting: run static code checks to catch coding issues, and ensure the coding style is consistent across the codebase. Here’s an example of the types of issues Bluesky’s linter has captured:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5be214a0-188c-4a10-9d81-78f1ce6be95b_1600x708.png">    </a>Unused variables assigned a value cause the linter to raise warnings. It’s sensible for production codebases to not have variables lying around.

Source: <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/blob/main/packages/bsky/tests/views/likes.test.ts">Bluesky source code</a>  Mobile and web stack <p>One fascinating thing about Bluesky is that the website, iOS app, and Android mobile app, were all built by a single developer. From summer 2022 until early 2023, it was engineer Paul Frazee who worked on this, alone. Early in 2023, the app had some external contributors, and the second full time hire joined in April. The tech stack that enabled all of this was React Native and Expo:</p><p>On choosing React Native, Paul Frazee explains:</p><blockquote><p>“We knew we wanted to hit all of the major platforms right from the start, and given our Typescript focus, there was only one viable way to do that: React Native.&nbsp;</p><p>If you have two separate application codebases, then you have two separate products. You’re implementing everything twice, and you’re debugging everything twice, and the outcomes are all going to slightly vary.”</p></blockquote><p>But React Native is not a “magic bullet” solution, says Paul:</p><blockquote><p>“It’s not easy. Some days it’s maddening. A lot of web developers know how frustrating it is to target multiple browsers; now imagine targeting native iOS and Android, as well. That said, this is a choice between ‘kind of frustrating sometimes’ and ‘impossible.’”</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://expo.dev/">Expo</a> is a platform to develop, review and deploy universal native apps that run on the web, iOS and Android. Bluesky introduced it in March 2023, and while the team was careful in limiting the introduction of new dependencies, the purpose was to manage builds and access Expo’s module ecosystem.</p><p>React Native for web was a choice that surprised even the development team. Initially, Paul intended to use React Native only for mobile apps, but then they found React Native is pretty manageable for the web. Paul explains:</p><blockquote><p>“The amount of stuff we're able to do with code sharing is just stellar. We've got shared code running everywhere, from our backend all the way into each of these different platforms, and that's part of why we've been able to do this with a small team.”</p></blockquote> “One-person” mobile app <p>As mentioned above, The Bluesky mobile app and website were built by a single developer in around a year, Paul Frazee. Today, six engineers work on the app and website, and roughly the same number on the protocol and backend side.</p><p>Still, it’s remarkably efficient to build a launch-ready app with a single, experienced engineer. So how did Paul pull it off?</p><p>He started off by building the protocol, not the app. For the first 6 months, Paul worked with Daniel and Jay, in consultation with Twitter, to figure out how the protocol would work. Bluesky’s idea was that the protocol would be the more important part, and there was an expectation they’d eventually build an app. But this realization didn’t occur until mid-2022. From Paul:</p><blockquote><p>“We always knew we would build an app, because we believe that protocol development should be done in conjunction with app development, but we initially thought it would be more of a prototype. It wasn’t until our relationship with Twitter changed that we realized we’d need to operationalize the protocol and make a full application. So, that was a bit of a shift.”</p></blockquote><p>The relationship between the backend team of Daniel and Devin, and Paul on the frontend/app team was like a traditional frontend/backend one. They spec’d out features together and discussed what each needed to do. They then worked on their own areas and coordinated on final outcomes.</p><p>Building the app helped evolve the protocol, and made the work more fun, Daniel recalls:</p><blockquote><p>“The most fun thing has probably been seeing our ideas come to life by building the social app on the protocol. It’s one thing to build/design a protocol in the abstract, but seeing it actually working in practice is another.”</p></blockquote> 4. Company culture

Prompt: “A vast field on which the ground spells the letters A and I, with people on it, having a good time.” Via Copilot | Designer
<p>People need <a href="https://projectvrm.org/2024/05/23/personal-ai-vs-corporate-ai/">their own AIs</a>. Personally and collectively.</p>
<p>We won’t get them from Anthropic, Apple, Google, OpenAI, Meta, or Microsoft. Not even from Apple.</p>
<p>All those companies will want to provide AIaaS: AI as a Service, rather than AI that’s yours alone. Or ours, collectively.</p>
<p>The People’s AI can only come from people. Since it will be made of code, it will come from open-source developers working for all of us, and not just for their employers—even if those employers are companies listed above.*</p>
<p>That’s how we got Linux, Apache, MySQL, Python, and countless other open-source code bases on which the digital world is now built from the ground up. Our common ground is open-source code, standards, and protocols.</p>
<p>The sum of business that happens atop that common ground is incalculably vast. It also owes to what we first started calling because effects twenty years ago <a href="http://bloggercon.scripting.com/2004/10/19.html">at Bloggercon</a>. That was when people were making a lot more money&nbsp;because of&nbsp;blogging than&nbsp;with blogging.</p>
<p>Right after that it also became clear that most of the money being made in the whole tech world was&nbsp;because of&nbsp;open-source code, standards, and protocols,&nbsp;rather than with them. (I wrote more about it <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/building-relationship-economy">here</a>, <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/linuxs-broadening-foundation">here</a>, and <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/wanted-more-open-source-research">here</a>.)</p>
<p>So, thanks to because effects, the most leveraged investments anyone can make today will be in developing open source code for The People’s AI.</p>
<p>That’s the AI each of us will have for our own, and that we can use both by ourselves and together as communities.</p>
<p>Those&nbsp;because&nbsp;investments will pay off on the with side as lavishly as investments in TCP/IP, HTTP, Linux, and countless other open-source efforts have delivered across the last three decades.</p>
<p>Only now they’ll pay off a lot faster. For all of us.</p>
 
<p>*See <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8934">what I wrote for Linux Journal in 2006</a> about how IBM got clueful about paying kernel developers to work for the whole world and not just one company.</p>

<p>The article shows how to implement a Microsoft Entra ID external authentication method (EAM) using ASP.NET Core, OpenIddict and FIDO2/passkeys. The application using ASP.NET Core Identity to manage the accounts and the passkeys. </p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/MfaServer">https://github.com/damienbod/MfaServer</a></p>



<p>The following flow diagram from the Microsoft docs explains how EAM works. Refer to the documentation for a full explanation.</p>



<p>src: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/entra/identity/authentication/concept-authentication-external-method-provider">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/entra/identity/authentication/concept-authentication-external-method-provider</a></p>







<p></p>



 Setup Microsoft Entra ID 



<p>To setup the external authentication method (EAM), the following needs to be created:</p>



 
 MFA server (EAM) deployed to a public URL 



 MFA server (EAM) has an OIDC discovery endpoint 



 MFA server (EAM) defines a OIDC public Implicit flow 



 Azure App registration public multi-tenant client using authorization_endpoint as the redirect URL 



 EAM created and added to the ME-ID authentication methods. 
 



<p>The external authentication methods (EAM) server should be created and the following three values are required:</p>



 
 –app-registration-clientId– 



 –your-client_id-from-external-provider– 



 –your-external-provider-url–/.well-known/openid-configuration 
 



 Setup Microsoft Entra ID App registration 



<p>The Microsoft Entra ID App client registration is a multi-tenant registration and required the authorize endpoint as the redirect URL.</p>



<p>The Microsoft Entra ID docs can be found here:</p>



<p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/entra/identity/authentication/concept-authentication-external-method-provider#configure-a-new-external-authentication-provider-with-microsoft-entra-id">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/entra/identity/authentication/concept-authentication-external-method-provider#configure-a-new-external-authentication-provider-with-microsoft-entra-id</a></p>



<p>API Permissions</p>



<p>The openid permission must be defined as well a profile scope if you want to request user data.</p>







<p></p>



<p>RedirectUrl authorization_endpoint</p>



<p>The Redirect URL is the authorization_endpoint of the OIDC MFA server. This must be set in the Azure app registration. This can be found using the OpenID connect well known endpoints in the browser.</p>



<p>–your-external-provider-url–/.well-known/openid-configuration</p>







<p></p>



 EAM setup using Microsoft Graph 



<p>Microsoft Graph can be used to create the Microsoft Entra ID external authentication method (EAM).</p>



<p>This requires the delegated Policy.ReadWrite.AuthenticationMethod permission</p>

 EAM setup using the Azure portal 



<p>The Azure portal can also be used to setup an EAM server. In the authentication methods, you can use the Add external method button.</p>







<p></p>



<p>The three values from the Azure App registration and the EAM server can now be used to specific the external method.</p>

<p>Once created, you can view this in the overview.</p>

 EAM MFA Server using OpenIddict and ASP.NET Core 



<p>The demo MFA server can be found in the github repository, linked at the top of the blog. The server is implemented using OpenID connect. I used OpenIddict to implement this. The user management is implemented using ASP.NET Core Identity and the FIDO2/passkeys support is implemented using fido2-net-lib.</p>



<p>The default Identity and OIDC flows are changed to remove the consent and only use passkeys. A user can register using his or her OID from Microsoft Entra ID and the preferred passkey.</p>



<p>ME-ID sends a OIDC Implicit flow request with specific claims and an id_token_hint with an id_token. the claims and the id_token must be fully validated. The tenant id (tid) must also be explicitly validation if you want to avoid phishing attacks. </p>



<p>The id_token can be validated as follows:</p>


  using Microsoft.IdentityModel.JsonWebTokens;
using Microsoft.IdentityModel.Tokens;
using System.Net.Mail;
using System.Security.Claims;

namespace FidoMfaServer.IdTokenHintValidation;

public static class ValidateIdTokenHintRequestPayload

    public static (bool Valid, string Reason, string Error) IsValid(ClaimsIdentity claimsIdTokenPrincipal,
        IdTokenHintValidationConfiguration configuration,
        string userEntraIdOid,
        string userName)
    {
        // oid from id_token_hint must match User OID
        var oid = claimsIdTokenPrincipal.FindFirst("oid").Value;
        if (!oid!.Equals(userEntraIdOid))
        {
            return (false, "oid parameter has an incorrect value",
                EntraIdTokenRequestConsts.ERROR_INVALID_CLIENT);
        };

        // aud must match allowed audience if for a specifc app
        if (configuration.ValidateAudience)
        {
            var aud = claimsIdTokenPrincipal.FindFirst("aud").Value;
            if (!aud!.Equals(configuration.Audience))

                EntraIdTokenRequestConsts.ERROR_INVALID_CLIENT);

    }

    public static bool IsEmailValid(string email)
    {
        if (!MailAddress.TryCreate(email, out var mailAddress))
            return false;

        // And if you want to be more strict:
        var hostParts = mailAddress.Host.Split('.');
        if (hostParts.Length == 1)
            return false; // No dot.
        if (hostParts.Any(p =&gt; p == string.Empty))
            return false; // Double dot.

            return false; // Double dot or dot at end of user part.

        return true;
    }
}
  


<p>When the user has successfully authenticated using the required MFA and the id_token is valid, the result is returned to Microsoft Entra ID again with required claims which match the request claims. For example the amr is returned as an array claim, the acr contains a value matching the request value, the sub claim is the exact same as the request claim and so on. The Microsoft specifics the requirements in the docs.</p>



<p></p>



<p>This could be implemented using OpenIddict like the following code block displays. It is important to also validate the id_token fully in the method . The signature must be validated and the user OID must match and so on. The claims MUST be returned in the id_token and not the user info endpoint.</p>


   //get well known endpoints and validate access token sent in the assertion
 var configurationManager = new ConfigurationManager&lt;OpenIdConnectConfiguration&gt;(
     _idTokenHintValidationConfiguration.MetadataAddress,
     new OpenIdConnectConfigurationRetriever());

 var wellKnownEndpoints = await configurationManager.GetConfigurationAsync();

 var idTokenHintValidationResult = await ValidateIdTokenHintRequestPayload.ValidateTokenAndSignatureAsync(
     request.IdTokenHint,
     _idTokenHintValidationConfiguration,
     wellKnownEndpoints.SigningKeys,
     _testingMode);

 if (!idTokenHintValidationResult.Valid)
 {
     return UnauthorizedValidationParametersFailed(idTokenHintValidationResult.Reason,
         "id_token_hint validation failed");
 }

 var requestedClaims = System.Text.Json.JsonSerializer.Deserialize&lt;claims&gt;(request.Claims);

 // The acr claims for the authentication request. This value should match one of the values from the request sent to initiate this request.
 // Only one acr claim should be returned.
 principal.AddClaim("acr", "possessionorinherence");

 var sub = idTokenHintValidationResult.TokenValidationResult.ClaimsIdentity
     .Claims.First(d =&gt; d.Type == "sub");

 principal.RemoveClaims("sub");
 principal.AddClaim(sub.Type, sub.Value);

 var claims = principal.Claims.ToList();

 // The amr claims for the authentication method used in authentication.
 // This value should be returned as an array, and only one method claim should be returned.
 // Openiddict between 5.0.1 =&gt; 5.5.0 does not support this.
 claims.Add(new Claim("amr", "[\"fido\"]", JsonClaimValueTypes.JsonArray));

 var cp = new ClaimsPrincipal(
     new ClaimsIdentity(claims, principal.Identity.AuthenticationType));

 foreach (var claim in cp.Claims)
 {
     claim.SetDestinations(GetDestinations(claim, cp));
 }

 var (Valid, Reason, Error) = ValidateIdTokenHintRequestPayload
     .IsValid(idTokenHintValidationResult.TokenValidationResult.ClaimsIdentity,
     _idTokenHintValidationConfiguration,
     user.EntraIdOid,
     user.UserName);

 if (!Valid)
 {
     return UnauthorizedValidationParametersFailed(Reason, Error);
 }

 return SignIn(cp, OpenIddictServerAspNetCoreDefaults.AuthenticationScheme);
  


 Testing the MFA server 



<p>It is hard to test the EAM server implementation directly from Azure. I created a test application to validate that the server handles the OIDC Implicit flow requests correctly and responds correctly with the correct claims like in the specification.</p>



<p>If implementing this is a production setup, the demo server requires a lot of changes for user and account management.</p>



 Notes 



<p>Microsoft Entra ID external authentication methods makes it possible to integrate with third party MFA servers. This can be really useful for SSPR, smart cards MFA, custom MFA and other such requirements. the external MFA would need to be set as the default or only MFA for users in Microsoft Entra ID for a good user experience. You would also need to integrate this into the continuous access policies and set the authentication strength correctly.</p>

<p>The Pulse is <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/s/the-pulse">a series</a> covering insights, patterns, and trends within Big Tech and startups. Notice an interesting event or trend? <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/contact/">Send me a message</a>.</p><p>Today, we cover:</p>  <p>Industry pulse. Replit pivots from “hobbyist coders” to enterprise, Microsoft takes on Apple with ARM64 laptop, Vercel’s late-stage funding round, GitHub Copilot extensions, and more.</p>  <p>OpenAI’s ethics crisis. Déjà vu: six months after OpenAI’s board booted out Sam Altman as CEO for “not being consistently candid in his communications,” Altman (since restored to his old role) faces new but familiar allegations. This time, he insists he knew nothing of predatory vested stock clawback terms, or that the demo voice of ChatGPT-4o sounds almost identical to Scarlett Johansson in the movie, ‘Her.’</p>  <p>Microsoft’s urgent security focus. After a string of embarrassing, high-profile security incidents, Microsoft is making security a top priority and putting its money where its mouth is, by linking executives’ compensation to security milestones. Tech companies might be wise to consider taking security as seriously as Microsoft.</p>   1. Industry pulse  Replit pivots from consumer to enterprise focus <p>Replit is a software development and deployment platform offering an online integrated development experience (IDE.) Founded in 2016, the company raised $222M in funding and was valued just above $1B in early 2023. In 2021, Replit’s vision was to <a href="https://blog.replit.com/b">bring the “next billion” software creators online</a>. During the 2023 fundraising, the stated focus was to <a href="https://blog.replit.com/b-extension">expand cloud services and AI development</a>.</p><p>There is a lot to like about Replit in the boldness of its vision, the generous free plan for developers, and a friendly pricing model. They also treat employees well; in November 2023 the company <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/138735980/replit-offers-liquidity-to-employees-via-a-tender-offer">offered a total of $20M in liquidity</a> to current and former employees.</p><p>Unfortunately, last week the company <a href="https://x.com/amasad/status/1791155645091283311">announced</a> letting go 20% of staff (30 people) and that it is switching focus to enterprise customers: not the “next billion software creators,” but “knowledge workers” and the “Fortune 500.”</p><p>To me, this makes sense. The company has built neat AI capabilities – a tool called <a href="https://replit.com/ai">Replit AI</a> – but AI is expensive to build and run. In order to have any shot at turning a profit, Replit needs professionals to pay more. There is little point trying to reach a billion or more developers if the company’s future is uncertain. Should Replit succeed in building a viable business from enterprise customers, I’m sure they will consider re-focusing on the “software creator” market.</p><p>Anecdotally, I’ve heard about the usage of Replit by startups and scaleups. A scaleup CEO told me they pay for Replit so they can hack together things; sometimes, when the engineering team says that building a prototype will take weeks to complete, the CEO spins up a Replit service, and builds a prototype of the project in a few hours which gets the point across. This CEO tells me they can’t roll out Replit to their company because it’s a “hobbyist product” without sufficient enterprise features. Well, this seems to be exactly what Replit is changing!</p><p>I expect more consumer-focused AI startups to pivot into enterprise. A takeaway from Replit is that AI-powered products are a hard sell for consumers, who are unlikely to pay more for them. For the economics to work, enterprise customers are needed, otherwise big trouble awaits down the line. Replit is making this pivot when it’s in a strong financial position. Good luck to the team in executing this shift!</p> Microsoft takes on Apple with ARM64 Surface Laptop

<p>Or suffer through my interpolation of YouTube’s auto-generated transcript,
interspersed with chat activity, if you are so inclined.</p>
 Introduction 
 
 I opened the meeting, welcomed everyone, and introduced myself as host. I
explained that today I’d give a brief presentation on the list of issues I
I’ve dreamed up and jotted down over the last couple mini-summits as
possible potential topics to take on at <a href="https://www.pgevents.ca/events/pgconfdev2024/schedule/session/191/" title="PGConf.dev: Extensions Ecosystem Summit: Enabling comprehensive indexing, discovery, and binary distribution">the Summit</a> in Vancouver on May
28th. 
 
 Presentation 
 
 
<p>These are things that I’ve written down as I’ve been thinking through the
whole architecture myself, but also that come up in these Summits. I’m
thinking that we could get some sense of the topics that we want to
actually cover at the summit. There is room for about 45 people, and I
assume we’ll break up “unconference style” into four or five working
groups. People an move to corners, hallways, or outdoors to discuss
specific topics.</p>
 
 
<p>Recall the <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/03/mini-summit-one/" title="Mini Summit One">first mini-summit</a> I showed a list of things that of potential
topics that might come up as we think through what’s issues in the
ecosystem. I left off with the prompt “What’s important to you?” We hope
to surface the most important issues to address at the summit and create a
hierarchy. To that end, I’ve created this Canva board<a>1</a>
following <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_space_technology" title="wikipedia: “Open space technology”">Open Space Technology</a><a>2</a> to set things up, with the
rules and an explanation for how it workjs.</p>
 
 
<p>I expect one of us (organizers) to give a brief introduction at the
start of the summit to outline the principles of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_space_technology" title="wikipedia: “Open space technology”">Open Space Technology</a>,
which are similar to unconferences.</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_space_technology" title="wikipedia: “Open space technology”">Open Space Technology</a> principles are:</p>
 
 Whoever comes are the right people 
 Whatever happens is the only thing that could happen 
 Whenever it starts at the right time (but we start at 2 p.m. and we
have only three hours so we’ll try to make the best of it) 
 When it’s over it’s over 
 And whatever happens is the right place 
 
 
 
<p>There is also a “Law of Mobility”. If you start out interested in one
topic and attending a session or discussion about one topic, and you
decide you want to do something else, you can wander over to another
session . Open Space Technology calls these people “bumblebees” who
cross-pollinate between topics. “Butterflies” are the people who hover
around a particular topic to make it happen.</p>
 
 
<p>And “Come to be Surprised” about what will come up.</p>
 
 
<p>I’ve split potential topics into topics in Post-its. we might have four or
five spaces. Pick a space, pick a session; we have two two-hour-long
sessions. I assume we’ll have 15-30 minutes to open the Summit, do intros,
and split up the sessions; then have people do an hour on one topic and an
hour on a second topic. At the end, we’ll do the readout in which we talk
about decisions we came to.</p>
 
 
<p>If you’re interested in facilitating any of these topics, simply drag it
in and stick your name on it.</p>
 
 
<p>First I thought I’d briefly go over the list of topics as I’ve imagined
them. I posted the list on Slack a couple weeks ago and added to it as
things have come up in the discussions. But I want to give a high level
view of what these brief descriptions mean.</p>
 
 
<p>This is ad-hoc; I don’t have anything super planned. Please feel free to
jump in at any time! I think I’ve turned on “talking permitted” for
everybody, or stick your hand up and we’ll be glad to figure out other
stuff, especially if you’re thinking of other topics or related things, or
if you think things should be merged.</p>
 
 
<p>Any questions or thoughts or comments?</p>
 
 
<p>I put the topics in broad categories. There’s some crossover, but the the
first one I think of is metadata. I’ve thought about metadata a fair bit,
and drafted an RFC for the kinds of things to put in an updated metadata
standard, like:</p>
 
 
<p>How do you specify third-party dependencies? For example, PostGIS
depends on additional libraries; how can those be specified in an
ideally platform neutral way within the metadata?</p>
 
 
<p>How to specify the different types of extensions there are? Stephen
wrote a blog post last year about this: you have <code>CREATE EXTENSION</code>
extensions, <code>LOAD</code> command extensions, background workers,
applications, and more. You have things that need
<code>shared_preload_libraries</code> and things that don’t. How do we describe
those things about an extension within a distribution package?</p>
 
 
<p>Taxonomies have come up a few times. PGXN currently allows extension
authors to put an arbitrary number of tags into their <code>META.json</code>
file. Maybe in part because of the precedent of the stuff that that I
released early on, people mostly put stuff in there to describe it,
like “fdw”, or “function” or “JSON”. Some of the newer uh binary
distribution packaging systems, in particular Trunk, have a curated
list of categories that they assign. so there might be different ways
we want to classify stuff.</p>
<p>Another approach is crates.io, which has a canonical list of
categories (or “slugs”), that authors can assign. These are handy they
group things together in a more useful way, like “these are related to
data analytics” or “these are related to Vector search” — as opposed
to the descriptive tags PGXN has now. So, what ought that to look
like? What kind of controls should we have? And who might want to use
it?</p>
 
 
<p>How would we specify system requirements. For example “this package
requires only a subset of OSes”, or the version of an OS, or the
version of postgres, or CPU features. Steven’s mentioned vector-based
ones a few times, but there’s also things like encryption instructions
provided by most chips. Or the CPU architecture, like “this supports
aarch64 but not amd64.” How should we specify that?</p>
 
 
<p>I covered  categorization under taxonomies</p>
 
 
<p>Versioning. I blogged about this a couple months ago. I’m reasonably
sure we should just stick to SemVer, but it’s worth bringing up.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Thoughts on metadata, or stuff I’ve left out? This is in addition to the
stuff that’s in the <a href="https://pgxn.org/spec/"><code>META.json</code> spec</a>. It leaves room for
overlap with core stuff. How do we create one sort of metadata for
everything, that might subsume the control file as well as the metadata
spec or <code>trunk.toml</code>?</p>
 
 Jeremy S in chat: So far this is seeming like a good recap of
ground that’s been covered, questions &amp; topics that have been
raised. Great to see how broad it’s been 
 
 
 
<p>The next category is the source registry. This is thinking through
how we should evolve the PGXN root registry for distributing
extension source code. There are questions like identity, namespacing,
and uniqueness.</p>
 
 
<p>These are broad categories but identity is how do you identify
yourself to the system and claim ownership over something.</p>
 
 
<p>What sort of namespacing should we use? Most systems, including PGXN,
just use an arbitrary string and you own a string from [first
release]. But other registries, like Go, allow you to use domain-based
namespacing for packages. This is really nice because it allows a lot
more flexibility, such as the ability to switch between different
versions or forks.</p>
 
 
<p>Then there’s the level of uniqueness of the namespacing. This is kind
of an open question. Another another approach I thought of is that,
rather than string that names your extension distribution being
unique, it could be your username and the string. That makes it
easier when somebody abandoned something and somebody else forks it
and has a new username. Then maybe people can switch more easily. To
be able to account for and handle that sort of evolution in a way that
single string uniqueness makes trickier.</p>
 
 
<p>Distributed versus centralized publishing. I’ve written about this a
couple times. I am quite attracted to the Go model where packages are
not centrally distributed but are in three or four supported Version
Control Systems, and as long as they use SemVers and appropriate tags,
anybody can use them. The centralized index just indexes a package
release the first time it’s pulled. This is where host names come into
play as part of the namespacing. It allows the system to be much more
distributed. Now Go caches all of them in a number of different
regions, so when you download stuff it goes through the Go stuff. When
you say “give me the XYZ package,” it’ll generally give you the cached
version, but will fall back on the repositories as well. So there’s
still the centralized stuff.</p>
<p>I think there’s a a lot to that and it goes along with the namespacing
issue. But there are other ideas at play as well. For example, almost
all the other source code distribution systems just use a centralized
system: crates.io, CPAN, npm, and all the rest.</p>
<p>And maybe there are other questions to consider, like is there some
sort of protocol we should adopt as an abstraction, such as Docker,
where Docker is not a centralized repository other than
hub.docker.com. Anyone can create a new Docker repository, give it a
host name, and then it becomes something that anybody can pull from.
It’s much more distributed. So there are a number of ideas to think
through.</p>
 
 
<p>Binary packaging and distribution patterns. I have a separate slide
that goes into more detail, but there are implications for source code
distribution, particularly with the metadata but perhaps other things.
We also might want to think through how it might vary from source
distribution.</p>
 
 
<p>Federated distribution gets at the Docker idea, or the <a href="https://www.ongres.com/blog/why-postgres-extensions-should-be-distributed-and-packaged-as-oci-images/" title="Why Postgres Extensions should be packaged and distributed as OCI images">OCI idea</a> that
Alvaro proposed a few weeks ago. Stuff like that.</p>
 
 
<p>What services and tools to improve or build. This goes to the
fundamental question of why we’ve had all these new packaging systems
pop up in the last year or so. People were saying “there are problems
that aren’t solved by PGXN.” How do we as a community collectively
decide what are the important bits and what we should build and
provide. Features include developer tools, command line clients,
search &amp; browse, and discovery.</p>
 
 
<p>Stats, reports, and badging. This is another fundamental problem that
some of the emerging registries have tried to to address: How do you
find something? How do you know if it’s any good? How do you know
who’s responsible for it? How do you know whether there’s some
consensus across the community to use it? The topic, then, is what
sort of additional metadata could we provide at the registry level to
include some hint about these issues. For example, a system to
regularly fetch stars and statistical analysis of a GitHub or a
Bitbucket project. Or people wanted review sites or the ability to
comment on on systems.</p>
<p>There’s also badging, in particular for build and test matrices for
extensions that will not only encourage people to better support broad
arrays of versions of Postgres and platforms. There could be badges
for that. so you can see how well an extension supports various
platforms. And any other sort of badging, like quality badging. The
idea is a brainstorming of what sorts of things might be useful there,
and what what might be best to build first, might be the the low
hanging fruit.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Any questions, comments,m thoughts, additional suggestions on the root
registry?</p>
 
 
 Interlude 
 
 
<p>Steven Miller: So the idea is there are topics on the left and then they
get lined up into the schedule? So there are five five different rooms, so
horizontally aligned it4ms are at the same time?</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): Correct. These are session one and these are
session two.</p>
 
 
<p>Jeremy S: I was kind of waiting to jump to that. It seemed like you were
just doing a review of all the topics we’ve covered, but I was waiting
until till you got through everything to bring that up.</p>
 
 
<p>Steven Miller: Oh yeah, good call, good call.</p>
 
 
<p>Jeremy S: I have the same kind of question/concern. This is a great list
of topics, now what do we want to do with the time in Vancouver? David, do
you think we need to go through everything on the list? How do you want to
spend the time today?</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): I was trying to do a quick review just so people
knew what these words mean. If you all feel like you have a good idea, or
you want to add topics of your own, please do!</p>
 
 
<p>Jeremy S: Like I commented in the chat, it’s amazing to see how much
ground we’ve covered, and it’s good to have a a quick recap. It’s 9:22
right now Pacific time — 22 after the hour wherever you are — I just
want to make sure we don’t run out of time going through everything.</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): I agree, I’ll make it work. I can speed up a
little. I know I can be verbose about some of this stuff.</p>
 
 
<p>David G. Johnson: Unless the ones from India, in which case they have half
hour time zone.</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): I was gonna say! [Laughs]</p>
 
 
 Presentation Continues 
 
 
<p>Binary packaging. This is the problem that PGXMan and trunk have tried to
solve with varying degrees of success. I think it’d be worthwhile for us
to think through as a community what, ideally, should a community-provided
binary packaging system look like?</p>
 
 
<p>And what’s the format? Do we want to do tarballs, do OCI like Alvaro
proposed? Do we want something like RPM or Apt or Python wheels?
That’s a that’s actually something I’m super interested to get into.
There was a question that came up two weeks ago in Yurii’s
presentation. I think Daniele suggested that the Python wheel package
format allows you to put dynamic libs into the wheel. That’s pretty
interesting and worth looking into as well.</p>
 
 
<p>How we go about building a community-based binary packaging registry?
How do we do the build farming, what platforms and architectures and
OSes would it support, and what sort of security, trust, and
verification? And the centralization: who runs it, who’s responsible
for it, how should it work at a high level?</p>
 
 
<p>Philippe Noël in chat: Phil from ParadeDB here (pg_search,
pg_analytics, pg_lakehouse) — First minisummit I can attend, glad
to be here</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Thank for coming, Philippe! Again, interrupt me anytime.</p>
 
 
<p>The next topic is developer tooling. Developer tooling today is kind of
all over the place. There a PGXN client, there’s the PGXN utils client
(which doesn’t compile anymore, as far as I can tell), there’s pgrx stuff,
and maybe a few other things. What sorts of tools would be useful for
developers who actually develop and build extensions?</p>
 
 
<p>CLIs and APIs can do metadata management, or scaffolding your source
code and adding new features through some sort of templating system.</p>
 
 
<p>The packaging and Publishing system based on how we uh ultimately
elect to distribute source code, and how we ultimately elect to
distribute binary code. How does that get packaged up with the
namespacing and all the decisions we made, to be as easy as possible
for the developer?</p>
 
 
<p>What build pipelines do we support? today PGXS and pgrx are perhaps
the most common, but I’ve seen GNU autoconf configure stuff and stuff
that uses Rust or Go or Python-based builds. Do we want to support
those? And how do we integrate them with our binary packaging format
and where Postgres expects to put stuff?</p>
<p>I think this is an important topic. One of the things I’ve been
dealing with as I’ve talked to the people behind Apache Age and a
couple other projects is how they put put stuff in <code>/usr/local</code> by
default. I suggest that it’d be better if it went where <code>pg_config</code>
wants to put it. How do we want to go about integrating those things?</p>
 
 
<p>Tooling for CI/CD workflows to make it as easy
as possible to test across a variety of platforms, Postgres versions, and
those pipelines.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Kind of a broad Community topic here. This gets to where things are
hosted. There’s a Postgres identity service that does Oauth 2; is that
something we want to plug into? Is there a desire for the community to
provide the infrastructure for the systems or for at least the core
systems of PGXN v2? Who would support it? The people who work on the
development ideally would also handle the devops, but should work closely
with whoever provides the infrastructure to make sure it’s all copacetic.
And that there’s a a plan for when something happens. People exit the
community for whatever reason; how will systems continue to be maintained?
I don’t think there’s a plan today for PGXN.</p>
 
 
<p>Another topic is documentation. How do we help engineers figure out how to
build extensions; tutorials and references for all the things and all the
various details. Do we end up writing a book, or do we just have very
specifically-focused tutorials like, “So you want to build a foreign data
wrapper; here’s a guide for that.” Or you just need to write a background
worker, here’s an example repository to clone. What should those things
look like?</p>
 
 <code>CREATE EXTENSION</code> 
 Hooks 
 Background workers 
 CLI apps/services 
 Web apps 
 Native apps 
 
<p>This also kind of covers the variety of different kinds of extensions we
might want to package and distribute.</p>
 
 
<p>Then there’s all the stuff that I filed under “core,” because I think it
impacts the core Postgres project and how it may need to evolve or we
might want it to evolve over time. One is the second extension directory;
there’s <a href="https://commitfest.postgresql.org/48/4913/" title="PostgreSQL CommitFest: Add extension_destdir GUC">a patch</a> pending now, but it’ll probably be deferred until until
Postgres 17 ships; it’s on hold while we’re in the freeze. This is a patch
that Christoph Berg wrote for the Debian distribution; it allows you to
have a second destination directory for your extensions where Postgres
knows to find stuff, including shared object libraries. This would make it
easier for projects like Postgres.app and for immutable Docker containers
to mount a new directory and have all the stuff be there.</p>
 
 
<p>I would love to see some sort of more coherent idea of what an extension
pack package looks like, where like if I install pgTAP, all of its files
are in a single subdirectory that Postgres can access. Right now it’s in
package config, and the sharedir and the libder and the docdir — it’s
kind spread all over.</p>
 
 
<p>Should there be a documentation standard, in the way you have JavaDoc and
rustdoc and Godoc, where docs are integrated into the source code, so it’s
easy to use, and there’s tooling to build effective documentation. Today,
people mostly just write short READMEs and leave it at that, which is not
really sufficient for a lot of projects.</p>
 
 
<p>There’s the longstanding idea of inline extensions that Dimitri proposed
back as far as 2013, something they called “units”. Oracle calls them
“packages” or “modules”. Trusted Language Extensions start making a stab
at the problem, trying to make something like inline extensions with the
tooling we have today. How should that evolve? What sorts of ideas do we
want to adapt to make it so that you don’t have to have physical access to
the file system to manage your extensions? Where you could do it all over
SQL or libpq.</p>
 
 
<p>How can we minimize restarts? A lot of extensions require loading DSOs in
the <code>shared_preload_libraries</code> config, which requires a cluster restart.
How can we minimize that need? There are ways to minimize restarts; it’s
just a broad category I threw in.</p>
 
 
<p>What Namespacing is there? I touched on this topic when I wrote about Go
Namespacing a while ago. My current assumption is, if we decided to
support <code>user/extension_string</code> or <code>hostname/user/extension_string</code>
namespacing for package and source distribution, Postgres itself still has
to stick to a single string. How would we like to see that evolve in the
future?</p>
 
 
<p>What kind of sandboxing, code signing, security and trust could be built
into the system? Part of the reason they’ve resisted having a second
extension directory up to now is to have one place where everything was,
where the DBA knows where things are, and it’s a lot it’s easier to manage
there. But it’s also because otherwise people will put junk in there. Are
there ideas we can borrow from other projects or technologies where
anything in some directory is sandboxed, And how is it sandboxed? Is it
just for a single database or a single user? Do we have some sort of code
signing we can build into the system so that Postgres verifies an
extension when you install it? What other kinds of security and trust
could implement?</p>
<p>This is a high level, future-looking topic that occurred to me, but it
comes up especially when I talk to the big cloud vendors.</p>
 
 
<p>An idea I had is dynamic module loading. It came up during Jonathan’s
talk, where there was a question about how one could use Rust crates in
PL/Rust, a trusted language. Well, a DBA has to approve a pre-installed
list of crates that’s on the file system where PL/Rust can load them. But
what if there was a hook where, in PL/Perl for example, you <code>use Thing</code>
and a hook in the Perl <code>use</code> command knows to look in a table that the DBA
manages and can load it from there. Just a funky idea I had, a way to get
away from the file system and more easily let people, through permissions,
be able to load modules in a safe way.</p>
 
 
<p>A topic that came up during Yurii’s talk was binary compatibility of minor
releases, or some sort of ABI stability. I’d be curious what to bring up
with hackers on formalizing something there. Although it has seemed mostly
pretty stable over time to me, that doesn’t mean it’s been fully stable.
I’d be curious to hear about the exceptions.</p>
 
 
<p>So! That’s my quick review. I did the remainder of them in 11 minutes!</p>
 Discussion 
 
 
<p>Jeremy S: Well done.</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): What I’d like to do is send an email to all the
people who are registered to come to The Summit in two weeks, as well as
all of you, to be able to access this board and put stars or icons or
something — stickers which you can access —</p>
 
 
<p>Jeremy S: I do feel like there’s something missing from the board. I don’t
know that it’s something we would have wanted to put on sooner, but I kind
of feel like one of the next steps is just getting down into the trenches
and looking at actual extensions, and seeing how a lot of these topics are
going to apply once we start looking like at the list. I was looking
around a bit.</p>
<p>It’s funny; I see a mailing list thread from a year or two ago where,
right after Joel made his big list of 1,000 extensions, he jumped on the
hackers list and said, “hey could we stick this somewhere like on the
wiki?” And it looks like nobody quite got around to doing anything like
tha. But that’s where I was thinking about poking around, maybe maybe
starting to work on something like that.</p>
<p>But I think once we start to look at some of the actual extensions, it’ll
help us with a lot of these topics, kind of figure out what we’re talking
about. Like when you’re when you’re trying to figure out dependencies,
once you start to figure out some of the actual extensions where this is a
problem and other ones where it’s not, it might help us to have be a lot
more specific about the problem that we’re trying to solve. Or whether
it’s versioning, which platform something is going to build on, all that
kind of stuff. That’s where I was thinking a topic — or maybe a next
step or a topic that’s missing, or you were talking about how many
extensions even build today. If you go through the extensions on PGXN
right now, how many of them even work, at all. So starting to work down
that list.</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): So, two thoughts on that. One is: create a sticky
with the topic you want and stick it in a place that’s appropriate, or
create another category if you think that’s relevant.</p>
 
 
<p>Jeremy S: It’s kind of weird, because what I would envision is what I want
to do on the wiki — I’ll see if I can start this off today, I have
rights to make a Postgres Wiki page — is I want to make a list of
extensions, like a table, where down the left is the extensions and across
the top is where that extension is distributed today. So just extensions
that are already distributed like in multiple places. I’m not talking
about the stuff that’s on core, because that’s a given that it’s
everywhere. But something like pg_cron or PGAudit, anybody who has
extensions probably has them. That gives some sense of the extensions that
everybody already packages. Those are obviously really important
extensions, because everybody is including them.</p>
<p>And then the next thing I wanted to do was the same thing with the list of
those extensions on the left but a column for each of the categories you
have here. For, say, PGAudit, for stuff across the top — metadata,
registry packaging, developer stuff — for PGAudit are their packaging
concerns? For PGAudit, go down the list of registry topics like identity,
where’s the where is the source for PGAudit, is the definitive upstream
GitLab, isit GitHub, is it git.postgresql.org? I could go right down the
list of each of these topics for PGAudit. and then go down the list of all
of your topics for pg_hint_plan. That’s another big one; pg_hint_plan is
all over the place. Each of your topics I could take and apply to each of
the top 10 extensions and there might be different things that rise to the
surface for pg_hint_plan than there are for, like, pgvector.</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): That sounds like a worthwhile project to me, and
it could be a useful reference for any of these topics. Also a lot of
work!</p>
 
 
<p>Jeremy S: Well, in another way to like think about Vancouver might be,
instead of like splitting people up by these topics — I’m spitballing
here, this this might be a terrible idea — but you could take a list of
like 20 or 30 important extensions split people up into groups and say,
“here’s five extensions for you, now cover all these topics for your five
extensions.” You might have one group that’s looking at like pg_hint_plan
and pgvector and PGAudit, and then a different group that has pg_cron and
whatever else we come up with. That’s just another way you could slice it
up.</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): Yeah, I think that you’re thinking about it the
inverse the way I’ve been thinking of it. I guess mine is perhaps a little
more centralized and top down, and that comes from having worked on PGXN
in the past and thinking about what we’d like to build in the future. But
there’s no reason it couldn’t be bottom up from those things. I will say,
when I was working on the metadata RFC, I did work through an example of
some actually really fussy extension — I don’t remember which one it was
— or no, I think it was the ML extension.<a>3</a> I think that could be a
really useful exercise.</p>
<p>But the idea the Open Technology Space is that you can create a sticky,
make a pitch for it, and have people vote by putting a star or something
on them. I’m hoping that, a. we can try to figure out which ones we feel
are the most important, but ultimately anybody can grab one of these and
say “I want to own this, I’m putting it in session session one, and put
your put your name on it. They ca be anything, for the most part.</p>
 
 
<p>Jeremy S: Sure. I think I don’t totally grok the Canva
board and how that all maps out, but at the end of the day whatever you
say we’re doing in Vancouver I’m behind it 100%.</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): I’m trying to make it as open as possible. If
there’s something you want to talk about, make a sticky.</p>
 
 
<p>Jeremy S: I’ll add a little box. I’m not sure how this maps to what you
want to do with the time in Vancouver.</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): Hopefully this will answer the question. First
we’ll do an intro and welcome and talk about the topics, give people time
to look at them, I want to send it in advance so people can have a sense
of it in advance. I know the way they do the the Postgres unconference
that’s been the last day of PGCon for years, they have people come and put
a sticky or star or some sort of sticker on the topics they like, and then
they pick the ones that have the most and and those are the ones they line
up in here [the agenda]. But the idea of the Open Technology stuff is a
person can decide on whatever topic they want, they can create their sticky,
they can put it in the set slot they want and whatever space they want,
and —</p>
 
 
<p>Jeremy S: Ooooh, I think I get it now. Okay, I didn’t realize that’s what
you were doing with the Canva board. Now I get it.</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): Yeah, I was trying to more or less do an
unconference thing, but because we only have three hours try to have a
solid idea of the topics we want to address are before we get there.</p>
 
 
<p>Jeremy S: I don’t know though. Are you hoping a whole bunch of people are
going to come in here and like put it — Okay, it took me five or ten
minutes to to even realize what you were doing, and I don’t have high
hopes that we’ll get 20 people to come in and vote on the Post-it notes in
the next seven days.</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): Yeah, maybe we need to…  These instructions here
are meant to help people understand that and if that needs to be
tweaked, let’s do it.</p>
 
 David G. Johnston in chat: How many people are going to in this
summit in Vancouver? 
 David G. Johnston in chat: Is the output of a session just
discussions or are action items desired? 
 
 
 
<p>Steven Miller: I have another question. Are people invited to
present at the Summit if they’re not physically present at the Summit? And then
same question for viewership</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): I don’t think they are providing remote stuff at
the Summit</p>
 
 
<p>Steven Miller: okay</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): David, last I heard there were 42 people
registered. I think we have space for 45. We can maybe get up to 50 with
some standing room, and there’s a surprisingly large number of people
(laughs).</p>
 
 David G. Johnston in chat: So average of 10 in each space? 
 
 
 
<p>Jeremy S: Have you gone down the list of names and started to figure out
who all these people? Cuz that’s another thing. There might be people who
have very little background and just thought “this sounds like an
interesting topic.” How those people would contribute and participate
would be very different from someone who’s been working with extensions
for a long time.</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): David, yeah, and we can add more spaces or
whatever if it makes sense, or people can just arbitrarily go to a corner.
Because it’s an unconference they can elect to do whatever interests them.
I’m just hoping to have like the top six things we think are most
important to get to ahead of time.</p>
<p>Jeremy, Melanie sent me the list of participants, and I recognized perhaps
a quarter of the names were people who’re pretty involved in the
community, and the rest I don’t know at all. so I think it’s going to be
all over the map.</p>
 
 
<p>Steven Miller: So would it work if somebody wanted to do a presentation,
they can. They grab stickies from the left and then you could also
duplicate stickies because maybe there’d be some overlap, and then you put
them in a session. But there’s basically supposed to be only one name per
field, and that’s who’s presenting.</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): You can put however many names on it as you want.
Open technology usually says there’s one person who’s facilitating and
another person should take notes.</p>
 
 
<p>Steven Miller: Okay.</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): But whatever works! The way I’m imagining it is,
people say, “Okay I want to talk to other people about make some decisions
about, I don’t know, documentation standards.” So they go off to a corner
and they talk about it for an hour. There are some notes. And the final
half hour we’ll have readouts from those, from whatever was talked about
there.</p>
 
 
<p>Steven Miller: These are small working sessions really,it’s not like
a conference presentation. Okay, got it</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): Yeah. I mean, somebody might come prepared with a
brief presentation if they want to set the context. [Laughs] Which is what
I was trying to do for the overall thing here. But the idea is these are
working sessions, like “here’s the thing we want to look at” and we want
to have some recommend commendations, or figure out the parameters, or you
have a plan — maybe — at the end of it. My ideal, personally, is that
at the at the end of this we have a good idea of what are the most
important topics to address earlier on in the process of building out the
ecosystem of the future, so we can start planning for how to execute on
that from those proposals and decisions. That’s how I’m thinking about it</p>
 
 
<p>Steven Miller: Okay, yeah I see.</p>
 
 
<p>Jeremy S: This sounds a lot like the CoffeeOps meetups that I’ve been to.
They have a similar process where you use physical Post-it notes and vote
on topics and then everybody drops off into groups based on what they’re
interested in.</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): Yeah it’s probably the same thing, the Open
Technology stuff.</p>
 
 
<p>Steven Miller: Maybe we should do one field so we kind of get an idea?</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): Sure. Let’s say somebody comes along and there are
a bunch of stickers on this one [drops stickers on the sticky labeled
“Identity, namespacing, and uniqueness”]. So so we know that it’s
something people really want to talk about. So if somebody will take
ownership of it, they can control click, select “add your name”, find a
slot that makes sense (and we may not use all of these) and drag it there.
So “I’m going to take the first session to talk about this.” Then people
can put the stickies on it over here [pasties stickers onto the topic
sticky in the agenda], so you have some sense of how many people are
interested in attending and talking about that topic. But there are no
hard and fast rules.</p>
<p>Whether or not they do that, say, “David wants to talk about identity name
spacing uniqueness in the core registry,” we’re going to do that in the
first session. We’ll be in the northeast corner of the room — I’m going
to try to get access to the room earlier in the day so I can have some
idea of how it breaks up, and I’ll tweak the the Canva to to add stuff as
appropriate.</p>
 
 David G. Johnston in chat: Same thing multiple times so people don’t
miss out on joining their #2 option? 
 David G. Johnston in chat: How about #1, #2, #3 as labels instead of
just one per person? 
 
 
 
<p>Jeremy S: Are you wanting us to put Post-it notes on the agenda now,
before we know what’s been voted for?</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): Yep! Especially if there’s some idea you had
Jeremy. If there’s stuff you feel is missing or would be a different
approach, stick it in here. It may well be not that many people interested
in what I’ve come up with but they want to talk about
those five extensions.</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): (Reading comment from David Johnson): “One two and
three as labels instead of just one per person?” David I’m sorry I don’t
follow.</p>
 
 
<p>David G. Johnston: So basically like rank choice. If you’re gonna do I
core one time and binary packaging one time, and they’re running at the
same time, well I want to do both. I want to do core — that’s my first
choice — I want to do binary packaging — that’s my second choice. If I
had to choose, I’d go to number one. But if you have enough people saying
I want to see this, that’s my number two option, you run binary packaging
twice, not conflicting with core so you can get more people.</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): I see, have people stick numbers on the topics
that most interest in them. Let’s see here… [pokes around the Canva UX,
finds stickers with numbers.] There we go. I’ll stick those somewhere
that’s reasonable so people can rank them if they want, their top
choices.</p>
<p>This is all going to be super arbitrary and unscientific. The way I’ve
seen it happen before is people just drop stars on stuff and say, okay
this one has four and this one has eight so we definitely want to talk
about that one, who’s going to own it, that sort of thing. I think what
makes sense is to send this email to all the participants in advance;
hopefully people will take a look, have some sense of it, and maybe put a
few things on. Then, those of us who are organizing it and will be
facilitating on the day, we should meet like a day or two before, go over
it, and make some decisions about what we definitely think should be
covered, what things are open, and get a little more sense of how we want
to run things. Does that make sense?</p>
 
 
<p>Jeremy S: Yeah, I think chatting ahead of time would be a good idea. It’ll
be interesting to see how the Canva thing goes and what happens with it.</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): It might be a mess! Whatever! But the answer is
that whatever happens this is the right place. Whenever it starts is the
right time. Whatever happens could only happen here. It’s super arbitrary
and free, and we can adapt as much as we want as it goes.</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): I think that’s it. Do you all feels like you have
some sense of what we want to do?</p>
 
 
<p>Jeremy S: Well not really, but that’s okay! [Laughs]</p>
 
 
<p>Steven Miller: Okay, so here’s what we are supposed to do. Are we supposed
to go find people who might be interested to present — they will already
be in the list of people who are going to Vancouver. Then we talk to them
about these Post-its and we say, “would you like to have a small
discussion about one of these things. If you are, then put a sticky note
on it.” And then we put the sticky notes in the fields, we have a list of
names associated with the sticky notes. Like, maybe Yurii is interested in
binary distribution, and then maybe David is also interested in that. So
there’s like three or four people in each section, and we’re trying to
make sure that if you’re interested multiple sections you get to go to
everything?</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): Yeah you can float and try to organize things. I
put sessions in here assuming people would want to spend an hour, but
maybe a topic only takes 15 minutes.</p>
 
 
<p>David G. Johnston: Staying on my earlier thought on what people want to
see, people who are willing to present and can present on multiple
things, if we have a gold star for who’s willing to actually present on
this topic. So here’s a topic, I got eight people who want to see it but
only one possible presenter. Or I got five possible presenters and three
possible viewers. But you have that dynamic of ranked choice for both “I’ll
present stuff” or “I’m only a viewer.</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): I think that typically these things are
self-organizing. Somebody says, “I want to do this, I will facilitate, and
I need a note taker.” But they negotiate amongst themselves about how they
want to go about doing it. I don’t think it necessarily has to be formal
presentation, and usually these things are not. Usually it’s like somebody
saying, “here’s what this means, this is the topic, we’re going to try to
cover, these are the decisions we want to make, Go!”</p>
 
 
<p>Jeremy S: You’re describing the the the unconference component of PGCon
that has been down in the past.</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): More or less, yes</p>
 
 
<p>Jeremy S: So should we just come out and say this is a unconference? Then
everybody knows what you’re talking about really fast, right?</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): Sure, sure, yeah. I mean —</p>
 
 
<p>Jeremy S: We’re just we’re doing the same thing as – yeah.</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): Yeah, I try to capture that here but we can use
the word “unconference” for sure. [Edits the Canva to add “an
unconference session” to the title.] There we go.</p>
 
 
<p>Steven Miller: I imagine there are people who might be interested to
present but they just aren’t in this meeting right now. So maybe we need
to go out and advertise this to people.</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): Yeah, I want to draft an email to send to all the
attendees. Melanie told me we can send an email to everybody who’s registered.</p>
 
 
<p>Jeremy S: And to be clear it’s full, right? Nobody new can register at
this point?</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): As far as I know, but I’m not sure how hard and
fast the rules are. I don’t think any more people can register, but it
doesn’t mean other people won’t wander in. People might have registered
and then not not come because they’rein the patch the patch session or
something.</p>
<p>So I volunteer to draft that email today or by tomorrow and share it with
the Slack channel for feedback. Especially if you’re giving me notes to
clarify what things mean, because it seems like there are
more questions and confusions about how it works than I anticipated — in
part because it’s kind of unorganized by design [chuckles].</p>
 
 Jeremy S in chat: <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PgConUnconferenceFAQ">https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PgConUnconferenceFAQ</a> 
 
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): Oh that’s a good thing to include Jeremy. that’s a
good call. But to also try to maximize participation of the people who’re
planning to be there. It may be that they say, “Oh this sounds
interesting,” or whatever, so and I’ll add some different stickers to this
for some different meanings, like “I’m interested” or “I want to take
ownership of this” or “this is my first, second, third, or fourth choice”.
Sound good?</p>
 
 
<p>Steven Miller: Yes, it sounds good to me!</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): Thanks Steven.</p>
 
 
<p>Jeremy S: Sounds good, yeah.</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): All right, great! Thanks everybody for coming!</p>

<p>I was pleasantly surprised by the experience (including the specification annotations referencing each test) and the organization of the testing framework even at an early stage.  I was able to get all the tests for the <a href="https://github.com/fediverse-devnet/feditest-tests-fediverse/blob/develop/example-testplans/saas-imp-webfinger-server.json">sass-imp-webfinger-server testplan</a> passing last night for <a href="https://github.com/herestomwiththeweather/irwin">Irwin</a>.

  Recently my friend Scott Mace asked this on X in response to a post about the evolution of software and how LLMs will likely follow that same trajectory: Yes, but how trustworthy will it be? Can I at least see the links it used to create its response?

 <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae49950f-95f1-402b-bce7-eca2c2164cc9.heic">    </a> <p>Recently my friend <a href="https://maceonhealthcare.blogspot.com/">Scott Mace</a> <a href="https://x.com/scottmace/status/1792624531368185920">asked this on X</a> in response to a post about the evolution of software and how LLMs will likely follow that same trajectory:</p><blockquote><p>Yes, but how trustworthy will it be? Can I at least see the links it used to create its response?</p><p>From <a href="https://x.com/windley/status/1792883491757076592">X</a><br>Referenced 2024-05-21T18:09:06-0400</p></blockquote><p>The short answer is "no", but the real answer is a bit more nuanced because of how LLMs like ChatGPT work. First the short answer: LLMs don't understand what they're saying so they can't reference the material that it used to create a response. They don't work like that. They don't go out, do a bunch of research and then create a response. Instead lots (and I mean LOTS) of material is fed into the program that creates the model, a multi-dimensional matrix of word orders. Then when you ask a question ("give it prompt" in LLM-speak), it processes the question and generates text based on the probabilities of words in its model1. There no way if can satisfy Scott directly cause the model doesn't—can't, as far as I know—include the references that it used to create the text cause it's generating it on the fly from material that has been thoroughly blended together.</p><p>But, in fairness, that's not what people do most of the time either. If you asked me over lunch or at the end of a tech presentation to describe zero trust and its pros and cons, I'd start talking. I wouldn't start looking up things on the web and somehow weave them into text complete with references. I'd go look for references if you asked me to back up something I said. So, let's try that with ChatGPT 4o. I gave it the following prompt:</p><blockquote><p>You are a writer for a website focusing on technology. Your specialty is security. Write a 150 word explanation of zero trust with three pros and three cons.</p></blockquote><p>ChaptGPT answered with this text:</p><blockquote><p>Zero Trust is a security model based on the principle of "never trust, always verify." Unlike traditional security models that assume everything inside the network is safe, Zero Trust assumes that threats can exist both inside and outside the network. It requires strict identity verification for every user and device attempting to access resources, regardless of their location.</p><p>Pros:</p>  <p>Enhanced Security: By continuously verifying users and devices, Zero Trust reduces the risk of breaches and unauthorized access.</p>  <p>Minimized Attack Surface: It limits access to only what is necessary, reducing potential entry points for attackers.</p>  <p>Improved Compliance: Helps meet regulatory requirements by ensuring strict access controls and logging all access attempts.</p>  <p>Cons:</p>  <p>Complex Implementation: Deploying Zero Trust can be complex and time-consuming, requiring a significant overhaul of existing systems and processes.</p>  <p>Increased Costs: The initial investment in technology and training can be high.</p>  <p>User Experience Impact: Continuous verification can lead to friction and inconvenience for users if not implemented smoothly.</p>  <p>Zero Trust is essential for modern cybersecurity, but it requires careful planning and resources to implement effectively.</p></blockquote><p>That's pretty good. But what if we need some references to other material to back up the pros and cons? I asked ChatGPT to supply them:</p><blockquote><p>Now repeat that task, but this time include references as hyperlinks to back up each pro and con.</p></blockquote><p>ChaptGPT answered with this text:</p><blockquote><p>Zero Trust is a security model based on the principle of "never trust, always verify." Unlike traditional security models that assume everything inside the network is safe, Zero Trust assumes that threats can exist both inside and outside the network. It requires strict identity verification for every user and device attempting to access resources, regardless of their location.</p><p>Pros:</p>  <p>Enhanced Security: By continuously verifying users and devices, Zero Trust reduces the risk of breaches and unauthorized access (<a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3572352/what-is-zero-trust.html">CSO Online</a>).</p>  <p>Minimized Attack Surface: It limits access to only what is necessary, reducing potential entry points for attackers (<a href="https://www.nist.gov/publications/zero-trust-architecture">NIST</a>).</p>  <p>Improved Compliance: Helps meet regulatory requirements by ensuring strict access controls and logging all access attempts (<a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-04-06-gartner-says-zero-trust-is-the-future-of-security">Gartner</a>).</p>  <p>Cons:</p>  <p>Complex Implementation: Deploying Zero Trust can be complex and time-consuming, requiring a significant overhaul of existing systems and processes (<a href="https://go.forrester.com/blogs/what-are-the-most-common-zero-trust-pitfalls/">Forrester</a>).</p>  <p>Increased Costs: The initial investment in technology and training can be high (<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-zero-trust/">ZDNet</a>).</p>  <p>User Experience Impact: Continuous verification can lead to friction and inconvenience for users if not implemented smoothly (<a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/zero-trust-security-model/">TechRepublic</a>).</p>  <p>Zero Trust is essential for modern cybersecurity, but it requires careful planning and resources to implement effectively.</p></blockquote><p>That looks great! Nice references for each bullet. There's just one problem. All the links, except the NIST reference, are dead. I don't know if they're wrong, made up, or stale. I tried finding content on a few of the sites by searching and came up dry. As I heard Johannes Ernst say once, ChatGPT is a "large language model" not a "large fact model" and this bears that out.</p><p>Still, asking for references or evidence for statements is something people are going to want. So, I tried a different tack. This time I asked this:</p><blockquote><p>Why do you say complex implementation is a problem for zero trust? Can you give me a few references on that I can read myself?</p></blockquote><p>ChatGPT responded with this:</p><blockquote><p>Implementing a Zero Trust security model can be challenging for several reasons:</p>  <p>Overall Complexity: Zero Trust requires a comprehensive understanding of your network's intricacies, including users, devices, applications, and data. This can involve significant changes to existing infrastructure, which can be disruptive and costly. Organizations need to be prepared for the extensive planning and resources required for successful implementation​ (<a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2024/02/01/zero-trust-challenges/">Help Net Security</a>)​​ (<a href="https://www.enterprisenetworkingplanet.com/security/pros-and-cons-of-zero-trust-security/">Enterprise Networking Planet</a>​).</p>  <p>Legacy Systems: Many organizations have legacy systems that are not designed to operate within a Zero Trust framework. These systems might require different security measures or even complete replacement, adding to the complexity and cost (<a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2024/02/01/zero-trust-challenges/">Help Net Security</a>)​​ (<a href="https://www.enterprisenetworkingplanet.com/security/pros-and-cons-of-zero-trust-security/">Enterprise Networking Planet</a>​)</p>  <p>Cultural Shift: Zero Trust is not just a technological shift but also a cultural one. It requires continuous verification and strict access controls, which can lead to user frustration and resistance if not managed properly. Ensuring user buy-in and minimizing disruption to workflows through training and communication is essential (<a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/blog/human-capital-blog/2022/zero-trust-adoption-for-human-centered-cyber-security.html">Deloitte United States</a>)​​ (<a href="https://guidehouse.com/case-studies/defense-and-security/2023/implementing-zero-trust-across-a-complex-multi-agency-client">Guidehouse</a>).</p>  <p>Resource Intensive: Implementing and maintaining Zero Trust can put a strain on IT resources due to the need for continuous monitoring and management. The need for advanced security tools and ongoing updates further adds to the resource demands (<a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2024/02/01/zero-trust-challenges/">Help Net Security</a>)​​ (<a href="https://www.enterprisenetworkingplanet.com/security/pros-and-cons-of-zero-trust-security/">Enterprise Networking Planet</a>​).</p>  <p>Stakeholder Alignment: Achieving buy-in from all stakeholders and aligning them with the Zero Trust principles is critical. This requires a coordinated effort to educate stakeholders, prioritize gaps, and ensure consistent understanding and application of Zero Trust principles across the organization (<a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/blog/human-capital-blog/2022/zero-trust-adoption-for-human-centered-cyber-security.html">Deloitte United States</a>)​​ (<a href="https://guidehouse.com/case-studies/defense-and-security/2023/implementing-zero-trust-across-a-complex-multi-agency-client">Guidehouse</a>).</p>  <p>These challenges highlight the importance of a phased and well-planned approach to Zero Trust implementation, considering both technological and human factors. For more detailed insights, you can refer to articles from <a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2024/02/01/zero-trust-implementation-plan/">Help Net Security</a> and <a href="https://guidehouse.com/insights/cybersecurity/2023/implementing-zero-trust-across-complex-multi-agency-client">Guidehouse</a>.</p></blockquote><p>Much better. The links in the bullets all work, but the ones at the end don't. The articles it references aren’t very detailed, so I wouldn’t say they’re stellar references, but at least there’s a pointer to outside material that discusses similar challenges. So, partial success. </p><p>I've found that when you're using ChatGPT to do research, treating it like a librarian and asking questions that follow up are the best way to gain confidence that the material is correct and find the supporting material, just like I did above. I'm sure you could wrap additional helper functions around an LLM to make getting references easier. But for now interrogation through chat is the best way to get comfortable with the results.</p> Notes   <p>Yeah, this is really simplified and thus wrong, but it's directionally correct.

<p>Aufgrund eines neuen Vorschlags der belgischen Innenministerin könnten die EU-Regierungen die vielkritisierte Chatkontrolle doch bereits im Juni beschließen. Das ergibt sich aus internen Informationen, die dem Europaabgeordneten der Piratenpartei und Schattenberichterstatter Dr. Patrick Breyer zugespielt wurden.</p>



<p>Konkret sollen nach dem neuesten Vorschlag Nutzer von Apps mit Kommunikationsfunktion per AGB oder Popup-Nachricht zustimmen müssen, dass alle verschickten Bilder und Videos automatisiert und verdachtslos gescannt und gegebenenfalls der EU und der Polizei gemeldet werden. Dazu sollen wohl auch Überwachungsfunktionen in bisher sicher Ende-zu-Ende verschlüsselte Messenger eingebaut werden, auch wenn die Belgier behaupten, die von ihnen vorgeschlagene „Uploadmoderation“ unterscheide sich vom „Client-Side Scanning“. Stimmt ein Nutzer der Chatkontrolle nicht zu, soll er den Chat weiter nutzen nutzen können, aber keine Bilder und Videos mehr versenden können. An EU und Polizei ausleiten sollen die Scanner-Algorithmen bekanntes Material und unbekannte Bilder und Videos, die von „künstlicher Intelligenz“ für potenziell verdächtig gehalten werden. Auf die Durchsuchung von Textnachrichten nach Hinweisen auf „Grooming“, die auch bisher kaum zum Einsatz kommt, soll genauso verzichtet werden wie auf das noch nie eingesetzte Scannen von Audiokommunikation.</p>



<p>Bei Vorstellung des Vorschlags am 8. Mai haben sich mehrere bisher kritische Regierungen wohlwollend und aufgeschlossen geäußert. <a href="https://www.parlament.gv.at/dokument/XXVII/EU/184770/imfname_11373735.pdf">Schon übermorgen (24. Mai) soll erneut über den „neuen Vorschlag“ beraten werden.</a> Direkt nach der Europawahl treffen sich die EU-Innenminister und könnten die Chatkontrolle beschließen.</p>



<p>„Der geleakte Vorschlag zeigt, dass der extreme Ausgangsentwurf der EU-Kommission zur in der freien Welt einzigartigen Chatkontrolle im Kern unverändert beibehalten werden soll“, warnt der Europaabgeordnete und profilierteste Gegner der Chatkontrolle Dr. Patrick Breyer (Piratenpartei).„Der neueste Vorstoß zur Chatkontrolle erinnert an die Fernsehshow ‚Lass dich überwachen‘. Messengerdienste rein textbasiert zu nutzen, ist im 21. Jahrhundert keine ernsthafte Option. Und Auswüchse der Chatkontrolle zu streichen, die ohnehin in der Praxis keine Rolle spielen, ist eine Mogelpackung.</p>



<p>Es bleibt dabei: Millionen privater Chats und Privatfotos unbescholtener Bürger sollen mit unzuverlässiger Technik durchsucht und ausgeleitet werden, ohne dass die Betroffenen auch nur entfernt mit Kindesmissbrauch zu tun haben – das zerstört unser digitales Briefgeheimnis. So landen unsere Nacktfotos und Familienbilder bei Fremden, in deren Hände sie nicht gehören und bei denen sie nicht sicher sind. Trotz Lippenbekenntnissen zu Verschlüsselung soll mit Client-Side-Scanning bisher sichere Ende-zu-Ende-Verschlüsselung allgemein ausgehebelt werden, um unsere Smartphones zu Spionen umzufunktionieren – das zerstört sichere Verschlüsselung.</p>



<p>Mich alarmiert, dass bisher kritische EU-Regierungen die umverpackten Pläne loben und dadurch die bisherige Sperrminorität zu kippen droht. Die Bundesregierung schweigt und ist wegen der SPD-Innenministerin Faeser seit Monaten ‚nicht sprechfähig‘ – dementsprechend bildet sie auch keine Allianzen mit anderen kritischen Staaten. Nicht einmal ein schriftliches Gutachten des Rechtsdienstes des Rates zu diesem offensichtlichen Grundrechtsverstoß ist bisher angefordert worden. Wenn die EU-Regierungen tatsächlich mit dieser radikalen Position zur Chatkontrolle in die Trilogverhandlungen gehen sollten, droht das Parlament hinter verschlossenen Türen erfahrungsgemäß seine Ausgangsposition schrittweise aufzugeben und sich auf schlechte und gefährliche Kompromisse einzulassen, die unsere Sicherheit im Netz auf Spiel setzen.</p>



<p>Jetzt ist die Zeit für Privatsphäre und sichere Verschlüsselung auf die Barrikaden zu gehen!“</p>

<p>There aren’t many out there who could begin to decipher RFK Jr.’s strange message to the Apes; but, since I’m one of them, here’s forty minutes of off-the-cuff analysis in which I attempt to weave together crypto gaming, esotericism, microbiome management, fin-tech behavioral economics, gut instinct, and cyclical harmonization of the commons – based on a foundation of ubiquitous sensing starting with carbon-nano permaculture protocols and personalized food prescriptions for AI-managed “wellness.” Remember, our biology is the post-Moore’s law technology. The future microbial network will run on orchestrated morphic fields coordinated by dynamic (Kundalini?) community currencies – always signaling the “wisdom of the crowd.”</p>

<p>👋 Hi, this is Gergely with a subscriber-only issue of the Pragmatic Engineer Newsletter. In every issue, I cover challenges at Big Tech and startups through the lens of engineering managers and senior engineers. To get articles like this in your inbox, every week, subscribe:</p><p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/subscribe?">Subscribe now</a></p><p>What does an early-stage startup look like? Usually, there’s an office with devs working on laptops, a whiteboard with ideas, and lots of writing of code. Sometimes, there’s no physical office because team members work remotely, sharing ideas on virtual whiteboards.</p><p>But what about companies which aren’t “pure” software startups, and which focus on hardware? I recently got a glimpse of one in San Francisco, at the offices of Oxide Computer Company, which is a startup building a new type of server. I was blown away by the working environment and the energy radiating from it. This is their office:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e61ec2b-7bd3-4b71-be93-c5d51ecc3de6_1600x1306.png">    </a>Hive of activity: Oxide co-founder and CTO, Bryan Cantrill at Oxide’s office, with under-construction servers, hardware measurement tools, laptops, and cables <p>Some things are hard to describe without experiencing them, and this includes being at a hardware+software startup right as the first product is being finished, with the team already iterating on it. In today’s issue, we cover hardware at Oxide:</p>  <p>Why build a new type of cloud computer?</p>  <p>Building a networking switch from scratch</p>  <p>Using “proto boards” to build faster</p>  <p>A remote-first hardware company</p>  <p>Custom hardware manufacturing process</p>  <p>The importance of electrical engineers (EE)</p>  <p>Working closely with hardware vendors</p>   1. Why build a new type of cloud computer? <p>If you want to build an application or service for millions of users, there are two main options for the infrastructure:</p>  <p>Cloud provider. AWS, GCP, Azure, Oracle, etc. Elsewhere, Uber is making the move from on-prem to GCP and Oracle, <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/uber-move-to-cloud">as previously covered</a>.</p>  <p>On-premises (prem.) Operate your own servers, or more commonly rent rack space at a data center for them. This approach is sometimes called a “private cloud.” We’ve covered how and why booking platform <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/inside-agodas-private-cloud">Agoda is staying on-prem and how its private cloud is built</a>. Social media site Bluesky also <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/bluesky">uses its own data centers</a> since leaving AWS.</p>  <p>In data centers, the unit of measurement is “one rack.” A rack is a storage unit that can hold a few dozen servers; often referred to as “pizza box servers” because of their shape. Thicker types are called “rack servers.” Side note: an alternative to pizza box servers is <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/124842294/the-evolution-of-data-centers-at-agoda">blade servers, inserted into blade enclosures</a> as building blocks in data centers.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s a “pizza box server” that online travel booking platform Agoda utilized heavily:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdeb72058-0c61-425f-b332-fb8402f33585_1270x582.png">    </a>A server Agoda used in its private cloud. See <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/inside-agodas-private-cloud">Inside Agoda’s Private Cloud: Part 1</a> <p>And here’s some commodity servers in Oxide’s office:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bac98b7-2a72-497a-8f98-ed6f314fead6_1600x768.png">    </a>A typical server rack at Oxide’s office at 50% capacity, running Gigabyte and Tyan servers. <p>The rack in the image above was operating during my visit. It was loud and generated a lot of heat as expected, and there were lots of cables. It’s messy to look at and also to operate: the proprietary PC-era firmware causes security, reliability and performance issues. “PC-era” refers to the 1980s – early-2000s period, before <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86#History">x86 64-bit machines</a> became the servers of choice.</p><p>Elsewhere, Big Tech companies have manufactured their own highly optimized racks and servers, but these aren’t for sale. The likes of Meta, Google, and Amazon no longer use traditional racks, and have “hyper-scaled” their servers to be highly energy efficient, easier to maintain, and with few cables.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f4895b2-6514-498b-8807-c73a116d36e6_1600x1063.png">    </a>Google’s custom-built servers. Source: <a href="https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/data-security/">Google</a> <p>Joe Kava, VP of Google's Data Center Operations, described these racks back in 2017:</p><blockquote><p>“Many of our racks don’t look like traditional server racks. They are custom designed and built for Google, so we can optimize the servers for hyper-efficiency and high-performance computing.”</p></blockquote><p>Back to Oxide, whose vision is to build a cloud computer that incorporates the technological advances of Big Tech’s cloud racks, but makes them available to all. What if smaller tech companies could purchase energy-efficient servers like those that Meta, Amazon, Google and Microsoft have designed for themselves, and which customers of the big cloud providers like AWS, GCP, and Azure use – but without being locked in?</p><p>This is what the Oxide Computer offers, and I’ve seen one of its first racks. It appears similar in size to a traditional rack, but the company says it actually occupies 33% less space than a traditional rack, while offering the same performance. It’s much quieter than an everyday commodity server; in comparison the Gigabyte and Tyan servers are ear-splitting, and there are hardly any cables compared to a typical server.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe09302cf-5e06-4576-94dd-ee1d59b23fe9_1384x964.png">    </a>Side and rear views of a fully-loaded Oxide rack. Fewer cables and SO MUCH quieter <p>The benefits of the Oxide computer compared to traditional racks:</p>  <p>Faster installation: installing a traditional rack typically takes weeks or months, says Bryan, because the servers need to be put in, wired up, and then tested. The Oxide rack comes fully assembled; it just needs to be slotted in at a data center.</p>  <p>Space and power efficiency. Uses less power and occupies less space. Less noise indicates superior power efficiency, with fans not needing to work as hard because the heat is channeled better.</p>  <p>Comes with integrated software to manage elastic infrastructure. With traditional rackmounted servers, it’s necessary to select software to manage virtual machines, like <a href="https://www.vmware.com/solutions/virtualization.html">VMware</a>, <a href="https://maas.io/">Metal as a Service</a>, <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-virtual-environment/overview">Proxmox Virtual Environment</a>, and <a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Ironic">OpenStack Ironic</a>. The Oxide cloud computer includes built-in virtualization for storage (an equivalent of AWS’s <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/what-is-ebs.html">Elastic Block Store</a>) and also networking (an alternative to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_cloud">virtual private clouds</a>.)&nbsp;</p>  <p>Oxide’s target customer is anyone running large-scale infrastructure on-prem for regulatory, security, latency, or economic reasons. The Oxide rack comes with 2,048 CPU cores (64 cores per “sled,” where one sled is Oxide’s version of a “rackmount server”,) 16-32TB of memory (512GB or 1TB of memory per sled) and 1PB (petabyte) of storage (32TB storage per sled). See <a href="https://oxide.computer/product/specifications">full specification.</a></p><p>This kind of setup makes sense for companies that already operate thousands of CPU cores. For example, we previously covered how Agoda <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/inside-agodas-private-cloud">operated</a> 300,000 CPU cores in its data centers in 2023; at such scale investing in racks like Oxide’s could make sense. Companies in the business of selling virtual machines as a service might also find this rack an interesting investment to save money on operations, compared to traditional racks.</p><p>An interesting type of customer are companies running thousands of CPU cores in the public cloud, but which are frustrated by network latencies. There’s a growing sense that multi-tenancy in public clouds; where one networking switch serves several racks and customers, causes worse latency which cannot be debugged or improved. In contrast, an Oxide rack offers dedicated rack space in data centers. Using these servers can also considerably reduce network latencies because the customer can choose the data center they use, based on their own regional needs. Customers also get full control over their networking and hardware stack – something not possible to do when using a cloud provider.</p><p>Oxide doesn’t target smaller startups that only need a few hundred CPU cores. For these businesses, using cloud providers, or buying/renting and operating smaller bare metal servers is the sensible solution.</p> 2. Building a networking switch from scratch <p>In server manufacturing, where does innovation come from? I asked Bryan:</p><blockquote><p>“Companies like Google, Meta and similar companies producing their custom hardware and software to build better servers, could bring competition to the market. However, it’s highly unlikely that these companies would release their servers as a commercial product. It’s not their business model.&nbsp;</p><p>So, no, the next big server innovation will not come from Google or a similar company. It will come from a startup. And we want to be that startup.”</p></blockquote><p>Oxide had to design two pieces of hardware from scratch: the switch and the server.</p> Why build a switch instead of integrating a third-party switch? <p>Oxide’s mission is to build their own cloud computer. Building a custom server usually means taking off-the-shelf components for a system and integrating it all together, including the server chassis, a reference design system board, and a separately-developed network switch. A “reference design” is a blueprint for a system containing comprehensive guidance on where to place its elements, that’s been certified to work as intended: it should not overheat, or cause unexpected interference.</p><p>However, Oxide also needed to build their own networking switch, as well as build a custom server – which is quite an undertaking! This need came from the constraint that Oxide wanted to control the entire hardware stack, end-to-end. A networking switch is a “mini-computer” in itself. So in practice, they designed and built two computers, not just one.</p><p>Producing a separate switch meant integrating a switching application-specific integrated circuit (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit">ASIC</a>), management CPU, power supplies, and physical network ports.</p><p>Oxide’s goals for this switch were:</p>  <p>Highly available operation. Each Oxide rack has two networking switches which operate simultaneously, as per high availability. If links to one switch have issues, or a switch needs to be serviced, then the servers can still access networks via the other switch, ensuring more reliable operation than with a single-switch setup.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Integrated with control plane software. The single most important factor in Oxide’s decision was the desire to deliver a quality end-to-end experience for multi-tenant elastic infrastructure. The team knew from their experience of deploying public cloud infrastructure that the switch is often a nexus of reliability and performance issues.</p>  <p>Use the same “core” hardware as the server. The switch must use the same regulators and power controller as the Oxide servers.</p>  <p>Building the custom networking switch took around 2 years, from designing it in March 2020, to the first unit being assembled in January 2022.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F77f367ca-e917-446a-95a0-5a055a876344_998x950.png">    </a>The initial build of Oxide’s network switch, codenamed “Sidecar”  <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F009fab28-c0a5-4e12-9158-c2b5de0eee5b_1196x1128.png">    </a>The front view of the initial engineering build of Sidecar <p>Building custom hardware almost always comes with unexpected challenges. In the case of the networking switch, the team had to work around an incorrect voltage regulator on the board, marked with yellow tape in the image above.</p> 3. Using proto boards to build hardware faster <p>Proto boards is short for “prototype printed circuit boards,” which help the company test small components to ensure they work independently. Once validated, those components can be used as building blocks.</p><blockquote><p>“When we set out to build a server from scratch, we didn’t want to go straight to building the server motherboard. However, when we started we had zero full-time electrical engineers!</p><p>There’s a process I learned from robotics people in a previous job, called a ‘roadkill build.’ You get all the parts that will end up in the thing you eventually build, but instead of being integrated, they are all spread out across a bench with nasty cables between them, so that you can probe them, poke them, and replace them. We thought it would be a good idea to do this for the servers.”</p></blockquote> First prototype board <p>For the initial prototype printed circuit board, the team started with the service processor. This was a well understood, very critical part of the server and the switch. The team decided to build it from two off-the shelf microcontrollers, and built a prototype board around this:</p><p>Starting out, the company took inspiration from robotics. Founding engineer, Cliff L. Biffle, <a href="https://github.com/oxidecomputer/oxide-and-friends/blob/master/2023_01_16.md">shares</a>:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffed8ca7d-f0ce-4a7e-bc5b-6c4fad41e066_1600x952.png">    </a>The service processor’s prototype board, which facilitates all communication between components of the server <p>The team found that It’s possible to bite off more than you can chew, even with prototype circuit boards, The first board was a success in that it worked: upon start up, the hardware and software “came up” (in electrical engineering, “coming up” refers to the successful powering up and initializing of an electronic system board.) But the time it took to develop was longer than the team wanted.</p><p>It turns out this prototype board was too highly integrated, with too many moving parts and too many I/O pins. There was simply too much on the board for it to be productive. The team learned that progress would be faster with multiple, simpler boards as pluggable hardware modules, instead of one complicated board with lots of functionality and many fixed functions. As engineer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mxshift/">Rick Altherr</a> – who worked on the board – <a href="https://oxide.computer/podcasts/oxide-and-friends/1173990">noted</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“We put too many things on. The concept we ran into was that an x86 server, with all of its management, is way too complicated. Let’s slim it down to just the management subsystems. This board is intended to be the service processor. But it turns out that even that’s too much.&nbsp;</p><p>By having so many things be on one board, instead of pluggable modules, it meant that we committed to a lot of design choices. For example, the two ethernet jacks were never actually used because we changed our philosophy on how that was going to work, before we got the boards back from manufacturing.”</p></blockquote> A more modular approach <p>Before building the service processor board, the team separated out the “root of trust” (RoT) functionality onto a separate board. The RoT hardware is the foundational base upon which the security and trust of the entire system are built. A RoT has “first instruction integrity,” guaranteeing exactly which instructions run upon startup. The RoT sets up the secure boot and permanently locks the device to ensure ongoing secure operation. Below is the prototype of Oxide’s RoT module:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F12630492-6230-4e3c-9edc-51972a39e997_1600x1262.png">    </a>The root of trust module; a separate, pluggable prototype <p>Other modules the Oxide team built included a power module, a multiplexer (a device with multiple input signals, which selects which signal to send to the output):</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff79caa9f-57c7-45fa-af67-695e0bb5d475_1470x858.png">    </a>The Oxide team built many modules for prototyping and testing <p>Over time, the team found the right balance of how much functionality the prototype board needed. Below is an evolved prototype board version of the service processor:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa8c939a2-a630-4345-bf3e-c7d9915741b5_1052x1148.png">    </a>Evolved version of the prototype service processor. Redundant ports like Ethernet are absent <p>The Oxide team calls this board a “workhorse” because they can plug in so many modules, and do so much testing and hardware and software development with it. Here’s an example:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fad40beac-01e3-471e-9340-76ec9c5bba19_1600x1200.png">    </a>The hardware version of modular development: a prototype service processor board with modules plugged in <p>A prototype board is unit testing for hardware. In software development, unit tests ensure that components continue to work correctly as the system is modified. Oxide found that prototype boards come pretty close to this approach, and allowed Oxide to iterate much faster on hardware design, than by manufacturing and validating test devices.</p> Using smart workarounds to iterate faster

<p>Zu der heutigen Entscheidung des britischen High Court, die Berufung von Wikileaks-Gründer Julian Assange gegen seine Auslieferung an die USA zuzulassen, erklärt der Europaabgeordnete Dr. Patrick Breyer:<br><br>„Die heutige Gerichtsentscheidung gibt Hoffnung, dass europäische Menschenrechte und Gerichte die Aufdeckung von Unrecht, Machtmissbrauch, Korruption und Kriegsverbrechen schützen, ohne Freund und Feind mit zweierlei Maßstäben zu messen.

Every organization or even many organizations will not want to maintain the governance needs to be a trusted issuer and instead will outsource that activity to a delegate that can ensure integrity and governance over their issuing activities.</p><p>For example, a gig platform such as Uber will not issue proof of work and proof of income credentials but will instead have a delegate do this on their behalf. The overhead for them in proper governance would be too steep. Instead the proxy/witness/delegate will collect the information from the source and issue a credential on their behalf. The delegate would be the trusted party in Trust Over IP&nbsp;(TOIP).</p><p>We see this in today’s world with service bureaus for different activities. The future will not be quite as decentralized as the potential for it to be because orgs will not wish to maintain the needed structures to ensure it. There is a place for well-known delegates.</p>

<p>Heute haben sich auf Initiative des EU-Abgeordneten Dr. Patrick Breyer (Piratenpartei) <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/MEP-Letter-Assange-before-UK-extradition-ruling-of-20.05.2024.pdf">31 Europaabgeordnete verschiedener Fraktionen in einem offenen Brief an den britischen Innenminister James Cleverly gewandt und dringlich appelliert, die Auslieferung von Wikileaks-Gründer Julian Assange an die Vereinigten Staaten zu stoppen.</a> Dies geschieht im Vorfeld der bevorstehenden Gerichtsentscheidung am 20. Mai 2024, die voraussichtlich final über Assanges Schicksal entscheiden wird.</p>



<p>In dem Brief wird die britische Regierung aufgefordert, ihre Verantwortung im Hinblick auf Menschenrechte und Pressefreiheit wahrzunehmen. „Genau wie die EU-Kommission verbreitet die britische Regierung die Mär, über die Auslieferung hätten ausschließlich die Gerichte zu entscheiden. § 70 (2) des britischen Auslieferungsgesetzes gibt dem Innenminister die Befugnis, die Auslieferung zu verweigern, wenn sie gegen das Recht auf Leben oder das Verbot der Folter und unmenschlicher oder erniedrigender Behandlung der Europäischen Menschenrechtskonvention verstoßen würde“, erklärt Breyer. „Die psychische Gesundheit von Julian Assange, die potenziellen Haftbedingungen in den USA und das reale Risiko eines Suizids bei Auslieferung führen dazu, dass die Auslieferung eine solche unmenschliche oder erniedrigende Behandlung darstellen würde.“</p>



<p>Die Abgeordneten betonen in ihrem Schreiben außerdem, dass die Verfolung von Julian Assange politisch motiviert sei. Die Bestimmungen des britisch-amerikanischen Auslieferungsvertrags verbieten zu Recht die Auslieferung wegen politischer Straftaten. Die eindeutig politische Natur dieses Falls wird durch zahlreiche und hochgradig voreingenommene Aussagen führender Persönlichkeiten der US-Politik deutlich, die seit mindestens 2011 die extralegale Bestrafung oder Ermordung von Herrn Assange fordern.</p>



<p>Ein weiterer Kritikpunkt ist das Fehlen einer Garantie der US-Regierung, dass Assange vor Gericht dieselben Rechte wie ein US-Bürger erhalten würde. „Ein Verfahren gegen jemanden, der Dokumente veröffentlicht hat, in einem Land, das möglicherweise grundlegende Rechte auf Meinungs- und Pressefreiheit nicht anerkennt oder anwendet, ist inakzeptabel“, so Breyer.</p>



<p>Breyer und die anderen unterzeichnenden EU-Abgeordneten fordern die britische Regierung auf, die Pressefreiheit und das Recht auf freie Meinungsäußerung zu schützen und die Auslieferung von Julian Assange zu stoppen.</p>



<p>Die Unterzeichner des Briefes schließen sich den Forderungen von großen Organisationen wie Amnesty International und Reporter ohne Grenzen an, die die sofortige Freilassung von Julian Assange verlangen. Sie betonen, dass seine anhaltende Inhaftierung das Recht auf freie Meinungsäußerung gefährdet.</p>

<p>Newsletters are all the rage now. In recognition of that, I blogged <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2022/06/21/newsletter/">here</a> two years ago about the idea of writing a solo newsletter. Since then I’ve been co-producing <a href="https://reality2.substack.com/">this one</a> with Katherine Druckman at <a href="https://www.reality2cast.com/">Reality 2.o</a>. It’s a Substack one, so I know how that game works on the production as well as the consumption ends.</p>
<p>Recently I also learned that WordPress makes it easy to turn blogs into newsletters, which is why you see “Get New Posts by Email” in the right column here. So, wanting an image to go with the news that this blog can now be a newsletter if you like, I said to ChatGPT, “Draw me Doc Searls blogging on the left side of the image, and producing a newsletter on the right side.” It gave me this, including the caption:</p>
Here’s the illustration depicting Doc Searls engaging in two different activities. On the left, he is blogging, and on the right, he is producing a newsletter. This split scene captures his multitasking abilities in digital content creation.

<p>Ein niederländisches Gericht hat gestern den Programmierer Alexey Pertsev zu fünf Jahren Haft verurteilt. Er sei deshalb der Geldwäsche schuldig, weil die von ihm entwickelte Software „Tornado Cash“ auch Straftätern vollständig anonyme und nicht rückverfolgbare Krypto-Transaktionen ermögliche (sog. „crypto mixer“). „Die Wahrung der Anonymität des Nutzers und die Verschleierung des Transaktionsverlaufs standen dabei im Mittelpunkt,“ so der Vorwurf des Gerichts. Aufgrund ihrer Funktionsweise sei die Software „speziell für Straftäter bestimmt“. In 36 Fällen seien gestohlene Kryptowährungen mithilfe der Software anonym in Umlauf gebracht worden, wofür der Programmierer verantwortlich sei. <a href="https://uitspraken.rechtspraak.nl/details?id=ECLI:NL:RBOBR:2024:2069">Das Gericht warf dem Angeklagten in seinem Urteil eine „Ideologie maximaler Privatsphäre“ vor.</a></p>



<p>Der Europaabgeordnete der Piratenpartei und Jurist Dr. Patrick Breyer warnt vor den Konsequenzen der Verurteilung: „Dieses Urteil kriminalisiert legitime Anonymität und alle, die sie als Programmierer ermöglichen. Die bei Bargeld selbstverständliche Anonymität, die unsere finanzielle Freiheit schützt, darf bei Digitalwährungen nicht kriminalisiert werden.</p>



<p>Die Konsequenzen dieser Denkweise könnten weit über Kryptowährungen hinaus auch Programmierer von Messengersoftware oder Anonymisierungsnetzwerke treffen. Aus diesem Geist heraus hat die EU zuletzt anonyme Barzahlungen eng begrenzt und mit der Chatkontrolle die Zerstörung des digitalen Briefgeheimnisses vorgeschlagen.</p>



<p>In jeder Freiheit nur den Missbrauch durch Einzelne zu sehen, schafft Unfreiheit und ist eine autoritäre Denkweise. Wir Piraten sind digitale Freiheitskämpfer, weil Freiheit Grundlage unserer Gesellschaft ist und ihr weit mehr nützt als der befürchtete Schaden durch ihren kriminellen Missbrauch.“</p>



<p>Die Spitzenkandidatin der Piratenpartei zur Europawahl und Informatikerin Anja Hirschel erklärt: „Wir Piraten sind klar pro Anonymisierung. Die Programmierung, der Betrieb und die Verwendung von Privacy-Tools muss diskriminierungsfrei möglich sein. Aus ihrer Verwendung reflexartig strafbare Handlungen unterstellen zu wollen ist grundlegend falsch.”</p>

<p>This post intends to contribute to the public debate on what could have been a significant legislation - Bill 194. This post is not a summary of Bill 194. I am not a lawyer, and this is not a legal analysis. The post below draws on my experience as a privacy and data protection expert and understanding of current standards and legislation. I will provide an overview of the bill's scope, goals, and provisions and assess its potential to enhance Ontario’s cybersecurity and respect the privacy of Ontarians. While Bill 194 introduces some welcome upgrades to Ontario's cybersecurity and privacy legislation, it falls short of delivering in several key areas, particularly protecting employees' privacy.</p> Overview <p><a href="https://www.ola.org/en/legislative-business/bills/parliament-43/session-1/bill-194?ref=webistemology.com">Bill 194, Strengthening Cyber Security and Building Trust in the Public Sector Act, 2024</a> (the Bill), was introduced in the Ontario Legislature for first reading and passed on May 13, 2024. It has been ordered for its Second Reading. Bill 194 has been introduced in the current context of the ongoing evolution of cybersecurity and privacy threats and the explosive growth of artificial intelligence. The Bill is, therefore, not surprising in what it is intended to address:</p><blockquote>The Act addresses cyber security and artificial intelligence systems at public sector entities. Public sector entities are institutions within the meaning of the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act and the Municipal Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, children’s aid societies and school boards. (See <a href="https://www.ola.org/en/legislative-business/bills/parliament-43/session-1/bill-194?ref=webistemology.com">explanatory note</a>.)</blockquote><p>It is worth noting that the Bill does not make amendments to the Municipal Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy - MFIPPA (the sister act to the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act - FIPPA). Hopefully, this can be addressed as the Bill goes through the legislative process.</p><p>It must be said that if one of the government's objectives in the Bill were to improve cyber security and privacy protections for Ontarians, this would have been a golden opportunity to introduce private sector legislation to provide a made-in-Ontario solution that could supplement and extend the protections offered by Federal legislation and ensure that Ontarians have robust and equivalent protection in both the public and private sectors. In particular, the government of Ontario's failure to protect employees' privacy is a long-standing issue highlighted by the gaps in this legislation. I note that the current Federal private-sector privacy law is due to be superseded by the contents of <a href="https://www.parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/bill/C-27/first-reading?ref=webistemology.com">Bill C-27</a>, but that is not part of this post.</p><p>Employees in Ontario do not have legislation that protects their privacy in either the public or the public sector. Public sector privacy protections were removed in <a href="https://www.ola.org/en/legislative-business/bills/parliament-36/session-1/bill-7?ref=webistemology.com">1995</a>, making Ontario unique among Canadian provinces in that it does not protect the privacy of civil servants at work. It is also the case that, due to employment being in provincial jurisdiction, Federal private-sector privacy legislation does not protect employees in Ontario.</p><p>Ontario-based employees in the federal public sector or employed under the federal labour code (entities like banks, for example) have privacy protection under federal legislation. Still, those are estimated to be less than 500,000 of Ontario's nearly 8 million employees or slightly more than 6%. In the private sector, employees under collective agreements, based on arbitral jurisprudence and the specifics of their contract, will have privacy protection, but that accounts for less than 14% of private sector works. I derived these numbers mainly from searching for available Statistics Canada and other online sources.</p><p>TL;DR — employees in Ontario are the least likely to have privacy protection at work compared to other provinces or territories.</p> The Bill <p>The Bill has two significant elements. Schedule 1, “Enhancing Digital Security and Trust Act,” addresses cyber security issues, the use of artificial intelligence systems, the impact of digital technology on children, and some general provisions, all of which will be addressed below. Schedule 2, “Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act,” amends the <a href="https://canlii.ca/t/2d9?ref=webistemology.com">Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, RSO 1990, c F.31</a>. Bill 194 is 51 pages long. From a content perspective, that is about 17 pages in English, with a matching section in French. If you think, "This seems a bit perfunctory, given the complicated nature of cyber security, digital protection of children, and privacy," you would be right. It seems to me that the entire bill could be summarized by saying that the government recognizes the importance of issues and will, therefore, write and implement regulations sometime in the future to deal with them. "Just trust us and pass the bill." When you compare this to the 4 years of discussion that went into creating the 458-page EU Artificial Intelligence Act, it comes up short, literally and figuratively. Closer to home, Bill C-27, which includes the Artificial Intelligence Data Act, is 148 pages (or 74 pages in English) but is accompanied by more than 100 civil society, industry, and expert submissions on the provisions and issues of the bill.</p> Schedule 1, Enhancing Digital Security and Trust Act <p>The following describes some of the more significant elements of this part of the Act. This includes Definitions (s. 1), Cyber Security (s. 2 - 4), Use of Artificial Intelligence Systems (s. 5 - 8), and Digital Technology Affecting Individuals Under Age 18 (s. 9 - 11), and some concluding general sections.</p> Definitions <p>The Bill adds a definition of artificial intelligence that appears to be derived, at least in part, from the definition of an AI system in Article 3 of the EU <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-9-2024-0138-FNL-COR01_EN.pdf?ref=webistemology.com">Artificial Intelligence Act</a>. (An easier-to-use reference than the official text can be found in the <a href="https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/ai-act-explorer/?ref=webistemology.com">AI Act Explorer</a> prepared by <a href="https://futureoflife.org/?ref=webistemology.com">The Future of Life Institute</a>). It may be summarized as any system that infers from input to generate outputs to accomplish explicit or implicit objectives. Using an AI chatbot is an example that is fulfilled by this definition. A sample of definitions that are included in the AI Act but not this act include:</p>  reasonably foreseeable misuse  safety component  training data  input data  <p>It is good that the Bill includes procured services and systems as a "use" of artificial intelligence systems. Still, much of the success of this approach will be determined by the nature of the due diligence in Ontario Public Service (OPS) procurement requirements for AI and machine learning systems. Another positive inclusion is that digital information includes collection, use, retention or disclosure by a third party. This will help ensure that accountability remains with the originating government institution.</p> Cyber Security <p>This part of Bill 194 boils down to a requirement for the government to make regulations governing cyber security, including s. 2 (1):</p>  requiring public sector entities to develop and implement programs for ensuring cyber security;  governing programs mentioned in clause (1), which may include prescribing elements to be included in the programs;  requiring public sector entities to submit reports to the Minister or a specified individual in respect of incidents relating to cyber security, which may include different requirements in respect of different types of incidents;  prescribing the form and frequency of reports.  <p>In the absence of a public consultation on the content and purpose of the governing regulations, there is no assurance that the regulations that will be promulgated will meet diverse stakeholder needs nor that they will be effective in proving the desired effect of protecting security. While section 3 allows the government to make regulations setting technical standards, the devil will be in the details here. Noting that there are boatloads of security standards to choose from. There needs to be governance to ensure that the standards chosen are enforced. For example, I have been a consultant on several projects inside various Ministries, and it sometimes surprises information architects and project managers that there are Government of Ontario Information and Technology Standards (<a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/information-technology-standards?ref=webistemology.com">GO-ITS</a>) to which their projects should abide. There is nothing to suggest in the Bill that even if good standards are adopted, they will be enforced with any rigour.</p> Use of Artificial Intelligence Systems <p>This part of Bill 194, similar to the prior section, mainly sets out the authority for the government to make regulations to govern the use of AI systems without creating content that could be publicly reviewed or publicly debated. I will note two particular gaps I feel should be addressed.</p> Developing an accountability framework <p>Section 5. (3) of the Bill states that each entity using artificial intelligence systems will develop and implement an accountability framework following the yet-to-be-published regulations. I will highlight what I believe to be two flaws with this approach.</p><p>There are no assurances in the Bill that marginalized or disadvantaged communities will provide input or be engaged in developing an Accountability Framework for an artificial intelligence system that may significantly impact their lives. Secondly, it appears that the approach in this Bill could lead to a proliferation of entity-specific Accountability Frameworks. This burdens both citizens whose data may be processed in multiple artificial intelligence systems with different frameworks and entities without the appropriate accountability expertise being asked to develop and implement their frameworks.</p><p>Rather than a proliferation of frameworks, creating a single Accountability Framework based on transparent, inclusive, and robust stakeholder engagement would be better.</p> Creating a risk framework <p>All that Bill 194 says on managing the risk of using artificial intelligence systems is, "A public sector entity to which this section applies shall take such steps as may be prescribed to manage risks associated with the use of the artificial intelligence system." This is woefully inadequate. The high-level risks and harms that can be created using artificial intelligence need to be articulated so that systems that may create high risks to individuals or Ontario as a whole can be identified, and those risks and harms can be identified and either avoided or mitigated. There is no identification of what might be termed unacceptable uses of AI systems or a way to identify whether a high-risk AI system - such as a system that collects biometric information about Ontarians and uses that as a basis for determining access to systems - is acceptable. (In my mind, such a system is inherently unacceptable.)</p> Digital Technology Affecting Individuals Under Age 18 <p>This section replicates the section above; it essentially boils down to allowing the government to make regulations that</p>  set out how children's information may be collected, used, or disclose  require reports about how children's information may be collected, used, or disclosed  may prohibit some processing of children's information  <p>I have two broad comments here. The first is that I am somewhat relieved that the government is not trying to introduce broad systems of digital control or censorship in the name of protecting children. Such legislation is usually both overly broad and ineffective in its intended purpose. That isn't to say that there aren't real risks to students that could have been articulated, not least of which is using easily available tools to enable students to create deep fake photos and videos of other students - creating real trauma and having real-world consequences.</p><p>My second comment is that many digital risks to students are also digital risks for their parents, including misinformation and other social harms. This legislation would have been a great opportunity, for example, to create a requirement for school boards to develop and provide curricula and training to support students in identifying misinformation through critical digital media training.</p> General <p>The last section of Bill 194 includes section 12, which states that nothing in the Act establishes a private law duty of care owed to any person. I'm not a lawyer, but when I <a href="https://ca.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/Glossary/CAPracticalLaw?docGuid=I188a88d2f92311e498db8b09b4f043e0&amp;transitionType=DocumentItem&amp;contextData=%28sc.Default%29&amp;ppcid=9d24509e378c447198416aeb9f522e24&amp;ref=webistemology.com">looked up</a> the phrase, it said, "A duty recognized by law to take reasonable care to avoid conduct that poses an unreasonable risk of harm to others." My only comment here is to note that despite the title of the bill, the writers of the bill have taken care to ensure that the heads of government institutions do not have a duty to ensure that they take reasonable care to avoid the risk of harm (aside from the requirement of privacy safeguards addition Schedule 2, which doesn't appear to me to be the same thing). It seems that where an individual's information, especially sensitive information, is collected under a legislative authority, the institution or head should have a duty of care for that individual's information. It may be that this is standard language in this kind of legislation, but it still leaves me a little perplexed. 🤷‍♂️</p> Schedule 2, Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act <p>This schedule is, in some ways, simpler in that it provides amendments to an existing Act (FIPPA) and doesn't endlessly defer to yet-to-be-determined regulations. Schedule 2 defines "information practices" to FIPPA, which will help those responsible for building systems comply with FIPPA. Some worthwhile elements for reporting have been added. I will take particular note of two significant changes: requirements for privacy impact assessments (PIAs) as well as breach reporting and notification requirement</p> Privacy Impact Assessments <p>This is a welcome addition to FIPPA. PIAs are a standard tool for identifying the risks to privacy in a system and recommending steps for their remediation. By standardizing the information required in a PIA, this legislation goes some distance to raising the floor for privacy protection and providing the ability to develop consistent expertise across all of government. I look forward to any prescribed requirements. This is followed by a section on risk mitigation that directs government institutions to implement the recommendations of the PIA</p><blockquote>I would be remiss if I didn't point out the obvious gap between this and Schedule 1. There is no directive in Schedule 1 concerning impact assessments for AI systems nor is there a direction to heads to mitigate identified risks.</blockquote><p>A copy of PIAs is required to be provided to the Information and Privacy Commissioner if asked. This could be improved by changing this to a mandatory filing with the Commissioner. This doesn’t require the IPC to approve the PIA but does make it available to the Commissioner promptly in case of a complaint or breach related to a system with a PIA.</p> Breach Reporting and Notice <p>Schedule 2 adds a Privacy Safeguards section to FIPPA. Specifically, the requirement is that "The head of an institution shall take steps that are reasonable in the circumstances to ensure that personal information in the custody or under the control of the institution is protected against theft, loss and unauthorized use or disclosure and to ensure that the records containing the personal information are protected against unauthorized copying, modification or disposal."  This begs the question of why this requirement for privacy safeguards is only being added now, but suffice to applaud it. </p><p>The requirement for privacy safeguards provides the underpinning for defining a breach as "any theft, loss or unauthorized use or disclosure of personal information in the custody or under the control of the institution if it is reasonable in the circumstances to believe that there is a real risk that a significant harm to an individual would result...". Such breaches will be reported to the Commissioner, whose budget will hopefully reflect this new obligation. The factors identified as determining whether there is a real risk of significant harm include:</p>  the sensitivity of the personal information;  the probability of misuse;  the availability of steps that a person could take to  reduce the risk of harm  mitigate the risk of harm    directions or guidance from the Commissioner  <p>With safeguards, breaches, and risks of harm defined, the last piece is the addition of a requirement to notify individuals if there has been a breach of their information. This is welcome but has consequences. In some circumstances, such a notification can be traumatic or require expenditures by the individual to compensate. Where is the requirement to compensate the individual or help them mitigate the impact?</p> Order Making Power <p>It is worth noting that the amended FIPPA will provide the Commissioner concerning privacy breaches a new power for the Commissioner and, I suspect, a welcome one to bring the Commissioner's powers for privacy in FIPPA in alignment with her order-making powers for Freedom of Information issues.</p> Wrapping Up <p>This post was created within a day or two of Bill 194's First Reading. I look forward to other and deeper contributions to the debate in the days to come. In the meantime, I have these takeaways:</p>  It is past time for Ontario to stop being a laggard in the protection of employee privacy and the government should, at the very least, amend Bill 194 to give public sector employees the privacy protection and respect they deserve.   A private sector privacy bill could address employment privacy issues, putting it under the authority of the Commissioner with private sector order-making powers. Alternatively, elements of privacy protection for employees could also be addressed by adding to Ontario's Employment Standards Act.  The government should use Bill 194's second reading and committee review to ensure that there is a clear legislative articulation of:  What are the acceptable and unacceptable uses of artificial intelligence  How to identify, categorize, and mitigate individual and social risks associated with the use of artificial intelligence    If the government wants to ensure that digital technology doesn't harm children, it should start with digital media training and take steps to prevent children from using technology to bully other children.  Consider recognizing that the government has a duty of care when it processes sensitive personal information under a legislative authority that deprives individuals of the ability to refuse that processing.  Adding PIA requirements with breach notifications will raise the bar for institutions processing Ontarians' personal information. This may lead to some interesting changes or headlines in the short term, but the longer-term consequences should be good.  <p>At the end of the day, the government appears to want to be able to take steps to address cybersecurity, children's data processing, and artificial intelligence through regulations. It will be interesting to see how, or if, the consultation process will significantly alter this approach. The public consultation is open until June 11th and can be found at <a href="https://www.ontariocanada.com/registry/view.do?postingId=47433&amp;language=en&amp;ref=webistemology.com">https://www.ontariocanada.com/registry/view.do?postingId=47433&amp;language=en</a></p>

<p>👋 Hi, this is Gergely with a subscriber-only issue of the Pragmatic Engineer Newsletter. In every issue, I cover challenges at Big Tech and startups through the lens of engineering managers and senior engineers. To get articles like this in your inbox, every week, subscribe:</p><p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/subscribe?">Subscribe now</a></p><p>I recently spoke with <a href="https://twitter.com/hkarthik">Karthik Hariharan</a>, who heads up engineering at VC firm Goodwater Capital, and he highlighted a trend he’d spotted:</p><blockquote><p>“There’s an engineering project I’m seeing almost every startup building a Large Language Model (LLM) put in place: building their own Retrieval Augmentation Generation (RAG) pipelines.</p><p>RAGs are a common pattern for anyone building an LLM application. This is because it provides a layer of ‘clean prompts’ and fine-tuning. There are some existing open-source solutions, but almost everyone just builds their own, anyway.”</p></blockquote><p>I asked a few Artificial Intelligence (AI) startups about this, and sure enough, all do build their own RAG. So, I reached out to a startup I know is doing the same: <a href="https://www.wordsmith.ai/">Wordsmith AI.</a> It’s an AI startup for in-house legal teams that’s making heavy use of RAG, and was co-founded by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rossmcnairn/">Ross McNairn</a>. He and I worked for years together at Skyscanner and he offered to share Wordsmith AI’s approach for building RAG pipelines, and some learnings. Declaration of interest: I’m <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/investing/">an investor in Wordsmith</a>, and the company has <a href="https://www.wordsmith.ai/">recently launched</a> out of stealth.</p><p>Today, we cover:</p>  <p>Providing an LLM with additional context</p>  <p>The simplest RAGs</p>  <p>What is a RAG pipeline?</p>  <p>Preparing the RAG pipeline data store</p>  <p>Bringing it all together</p>  <p>RAG limitations</p>  <p>Real-world learnings building RAG pipelines</p>  <p>Today’s article includes a “code-along,” so you can build your own RAG. View the code used in this article <a href="https://github.com/wordsmith-ai/hello-wordsmith">at this GitHub repository: hello-wordsmith</a>. To keep up with Ross, <a href="https://www.rossmcnairn.com/">subscribe to his blog</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rossmcnairn">follow him on LinkedIn</a>.</p><p>With that, it’s over to Ross:</p> Introduction <p>Hi there! This post is designed to help you get familiar with one of the most fundamental patterns of AI software engineering: RAG, aka Retrieval Augmented Generation.</p><p>I co-founded a legal tech startup called <a href="https://www.wordsmith.ai/">Wordsmith</a>, where we are building a platform for running a modern in-house legal team. Our founding team previously worked at Meta, Skyscanner, Travelperk and KPMG.</p><p>We are working in a targeted domain – legal texts – and building AI agents to give in-house legal teams a suite of AI tools to remove bottlenecks and improve how they work with the rest of the business. Performance and accuracy are key characteristics for us, so we’ve invested a lot of time and effort in how to best enrich and “turbo charge” these agents with custom data and objectives.</p><p>We ended up building our RAG pipeline, and I will now walk you through how we did it and why. We’ll go into our learnings, and <a href="https://www.wordsmith.ai/benchmarks">how we benchmark</a> our solution. I hope that the lessons we learned are useful for all budding AI engineers.</p> 1. Providing an LLM with additional context <p>Have you ever asked ChatGPT a question it does not know how to answer, or its answer is too high level? We’ve all been there, and all too often, interacting with a GPT feels like talking to someone who speaks really well, but doesn’t know the facts. Even worse, they can make up the information in their responses!</p><p>Here is one example. On 1 February 2024, during an earnings call, Mark Zuckerberg laid out the strategic benefits of Meta’s AI strategy. But when we ask ChatGPT a question about this topic, this model will make up an answer that is high-level, but is not really what we want:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc39fb336-b9a4-43b3-8cb1-7c95022ed02e_1536x998.png">    </a>ChatGPT 3.5’s answer to a question about Meta’s AI strategy. The answer is generalized, and misses a critical source which answers the question <p>This makes sense, as the model’s training cutoff date was before Mark Zuckerberg made the comments. If the model had access to that information, it would have likely been able to summarize the facts of that meeting, which are:</p><blockquote><p>“So I thought it might be useful to lay out the strategic benefits [of Meta’s open source strategy) here. (...)</p><p>The short version is that open sourcing improves our models. (...)<br><br>First, open-source software is typically safer and more secure as well as more compute-efficient to operate due to all the ongoing feedback, scrutiny and development from the community. (...)<br><br>Second, open-source software often becomes an industry standard. (...)</p><p>Third, open source is hugely popular with developers and researchers. (...)</p><p>The next part of our playbook is just taking a long-term approach towards the development.”</p></blockquote><p>LLMs’ understanding of the world is limited to the data they’re trained on. If you’ve been using ChatGPT for some time, you might remember this constraint in the earlier version of ChatGPT, when the bot responded: “I have no knowledge after April 2021,” in several cases.&nbsp;</p> Providing an LLM with additional information <p>There is a bunch of additional information you want an LLM to use. In the above example, I might have the transcripts of all of Meta’s shareholders meetings that I want the LLM to use. But how can we provide this additional information to an existing model?</p> Option 1: input via a prompt <p>The most obvious solution is to input the additional information via a prompt; for example, by prompting “Using the following information: [input a bunch of data] please answer the question of [ask your question].”</p><p>This is a pretty good approach. The biggest problem is that this may not scale because of these reasons:</p>  <p>The input tokens limit. Every model has an input prompt token limit. At the time of publication <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4-turbo-and-gpt-4">this is</a> 4.069 tokens for GPT-3, 16,385 for GPT-3.5, 8,192 for GPT-4, 128,000 for GPT-4 Turbo, 200.000 for Anthropic models. Google’s Gemini model allows for an impressive one million token limit. While a million-token limit greatly increases the possibilities, it might still be too low for use cases with a lot of additional text to input.</p>  <p>Performance. The performance of LLMs substantially decreases with longer input prompts; in particular, you get degradation of context in the middle of your prompt. Even when creating long input prompts is a possibility, the performance tradeoff might make it impractical.</p>   Option 2: fine-tune the model <p>We know LLMs are based on a massive weights matrix. Read more on <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/141865286/how-does-chatgpt-work-a-refresher">how ChatGPT works in this Pragmatic Engineer issue.</a> All LLMs use the same principles.</p><p>An option is to update these weight matrices based on additional information we’d like our model to know. This can be a good option, but it is a much higher upfront cost in terms of time, money, and computing resources. Also, it can only be done with access to the model’s weightings, which is not the case when you use models like ChatGPT, Anthropic, and other “closed source” models.</p> Option 3: RAG <p>The term ‘RAG’ originated in a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11401.pdf">2020 paper</a> led by Patrick Lewis. One thing many people notice is that “Retrieval Augmented Generation” sounds a bit ungrammatical. Patrick agrees, and has said this:</p><blockquote><p>“We always planned to have a nicer-sounding name, but when it came time to write the paper, no one had a better idea.”</p></blockquote><p>RAG is a collection of techniques which help to modify a LLM, so it can fill in the gaps and speak with authority, and some RAG implementations even let you cite sources. The biggest benefits of the RAG approach:</p><p>Give a LLM domain-specific knowledge You can pick what data you want your LLM to draw from, and even turn it into a specialist on any topic there is data about.&nbsp;</p><p>This flexibility means you can also extend your LLMs’ awareness far beyond the model’s training cutoff dates, and even expose it to near-real time data, if available.</p><p>Optimal cost and speed. For all but a handful of companies, it's impractical to even consider training their own foundational model as a way to personalize the output of an LLM, due to the very high cost and skill thresholds.&nbsp;</p><p>In contrast, deploying a RAG pipeline will get you up-and-running relatively quickly for minimal cost. The tooling available means a single developer can have something very basic functional in a few hours.</p><p>Reduce hallucinations. “Hallucination” is the term for when LLMs “make up” responses. A well-designed RAG pipeline that presents relevant data will all but eliminate this frustrating side effect, and your LLM will speak with much greater authority and relevance on the domain about which you have provided data.<br><br>For example, in the legal sector it’s often necessary to ensure an LLM draws its insight from a specific jurisdiction. Take the example of asking a model a seemingly simple question, like:</p><p>How do I hire someone?<br><br>Your LLM will offer context based on the training data. However, you do not want the model to extract hiring practices from a US state like California, and combine this with British visa requirements!&nbsp;</p><p>With RAG, you control the underlying data source, meaning you can scope the LLM to only have access to a single jurisdiction’s data, which ensures responses are consistent.</p><p>Better transparency and observability. Tracing inputs and answers through LLMs is very hard. The LLM can often feel like a “black box,” where you have no idea where some answers come from. With RAG, you see the additional source information injected, and debug your responses.</p> 2. The simplest RAGs <p>The best way to understand new technology is often just to play with it. Getting a basic implementation up and running is relatively simple, and can be done with just a few lines of code. To help, Wordsmith has <a href="https://github.com/wordsmith-ai/hello-wordsmith">created a wrapper</a> around the <a href="https://www.llamaindex.ai/">LlamaIndex</a> open source project to help abstract away some complexity. You can <a href="https://github.com/wordsmith-ai/hello-wordsmith">get up and running</a>, easily. It has a README file in place that will get you set up with a local RAG pipeline on your machine, and which chunks and embeds a copy of the US Constitution, and lets you search away with your command line.</p><p>This is as simple as RAGs get; you can “swap out” the additional context provided in this example by simply changing the source text documents!</p><p>This article is designed as a code-along, so I'm going to link you to sections of <a href="https://github.com/wordsmith-ai/hello-wordsmith">this repo</a>, so you can see where specific concepts manifest in code.</p><p>To follow along with the example, the following is needed:</p>  <p>An active OpenAI subscription with API usage. <a href="https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/overview">Set one up here</a> if needed. Note: running a query will cost in the realm of $0.25-$0.50 per run.</p>  <p><a href="https://github.com/wordsmith-ai/hello-wordsmith">Follow the instructions</a> to set up a virtual Python environment, configure your OpenAI key, and start the virtual assistant.</p>  <p>This example will load the text of the US constitution <a href="https://github.com/wordsmith-ai/hello-wordsmith/blob/main/hello_wordsmith/public_wordsmith_dataset/us_constitution.txt">from this text file</a>, as a RAG input. However, the application can be extended to load your own data from a text file, and to “chat” with this data.</p><p>Here’s an example of how the application works when set up, and when the OpenAI API key is configured:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0725b694-9547-4c8e-ba32-cda83db425f5_1180x772.png">    </a>The example RAG pipeline application answering questions using the US Constitution supplied as additional context <p>If you’ve followed along and have run this application: congratulations! You have just executed a RAG pipeline. Now, let’s get into explaining how it works.</p> 3. What is a RAG pipeline? <p>A RAG pipeline is a collection of technologies needed to enable the capability of answering using provided context. In our example, this context is the US Constitution and our LLM model is enriched with additional data extracted from the US Constitution document.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are the steps to building a RAG pipeline:</p><p>&nbsp;<br>Step 1: Take an inbound query and deconstruct it into relevant concepts<br>Step 2: Collect similar concepts from your data store<br>Step 3: Recombine these concepts with your original query to build a more relevant, authoritative answer.</p><p>Weaving this together:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdecd2b92-02ee-4fba-95da-61c75c473f26_1556x1572.png">    </a>A RAG pipeline at work. It extends the context an LLM has access to, by fetching similar concepts from the data store to answer a question <p>While this process appears simple, there is quite a bit of nuance in how to approach each step. A number of decisions are required to tailor to your use case, starting with how to prepare the data for use in your pipeline.</p> 4. Preparing the RAG pipeline data store

<p>This article demonstrates how to implement code analysis and Static Application Security Testing (SAST) using SonarCloud and GitHub Actions. The solution involves building a secure web application with ASP.NET Core for the backend and an Angular UI for the frontend, following a backend-for-frontend security architecture. Both the ASP.NET Core (C#) codebase and the Angular (TypeScript and JavaScript) files undergo analysis during the quality build process with SonarCloud.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/EndToEndSecurity">https://github.com/damienbod/EndToEndSecurity</a></p>



<p></p>







<p></p>



 Solution Setup 



<p>The application uses an Angular UI implemented with NX tools and services. During deployment builds, the UI is integrated into the ASP.NET Core backend, while in development, it operates as a standalone component. Microsoft YARP facilitates the connection between Angular development and local ASP.NET Core APIs. The Angular application is an integral part of the backend system when deployed. Both technical stacks require code analysis and Static Application Security Testing (SAST). Additionally, the solution is secured as a single OpenID Connect confidential client, utilizing the code flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE).</p>







<p></p>



 SonarCloud setup 



<p>I set up SonarCloud testing and integrated it with GitHub Actions using the repository from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcrufer/">Marc Rufer</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/rufer7/github-sonarcloud-integration">https://github.com/rufer7/github-sonarcloud-integration</a></p>



<p>This references the docs from SonarCloud and all the steps required for setting up a build and analysis of the different technical stacks are documented.</p>



 ASP.NET Core project setup 



<p>To enable SonarCloud to analyze both the ASP.NET Core project and the Angular projects, you’ll need to make adjustments in the .NET Core csproj file settings. Specifically, the Angular components should be added as hidden elements so that SonarCloud can properly detect and analyze them.</p>


  &lt;ItemGroup&gt;
&lt;!-- This is required to include ts and js files in SonarCloud analysis --&gt;
&lt;!-- Add to the sonar cloud build: EndToEndSecurity == github repo --&gt;
&lt;!-- /d:sonar.projectBaseDir="D:\a\EndToEndSecurity\EndToEndSecurity" /d:sonar.exclusions=**/node_modules/** --&gt;
&lt;!-- See https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube/9.8/analyzing-source-code/scanners/sonarscanner-for-dotnet/#advanced-topics --&gt;
   &lt;Content Include="..\ui\**\*.ts" Visible="false"&gt;
      &lt;CopyToOutputDirectory&gt;Never&lt;/CopyToOutputDirectory&gt;
   &lt;/Content&gt;
   &lt;Content Include="..\ui\**\*.js" Visible="false"&gt;
      &lt;CopyToOutputDirectory&gt;Never&lt;/CopyToOutputDirectory&gt;
   &lt;/Content&gt;
&lt;/ItemGroup&gt;
  


 Quality build 



<p>The SonarCloud github action YAML file implements the quality build. Normally this would be integrated with the default build, PRs and feature branches would run this. The dotnet testing tools are added but not active. The build uses a windows-latest image and java. When testing the code of the two technical stacks, you should ignore folders like node_modules and so on. This can be excluded in the YAML file. For this to work, the SonarCloud project must match the YAML file definitions. This is well documented in the Sonar documentation.</p>

 Badges 



<p>Badges from SonarCloud can be added directly in the readme file of the github repository. The badges are created in SonarCloud and I switched them to the overall results and not just the last delta. By clicking the badges in the readme, you are redirected to the SonarCloud test results.</p>







<p></p>



<p>SonarCloud is a great service for code quality analysis and has a good SAST implementation with very good access into the github UI and tools. Security alerts can be directly viewed in github.</p>

<p>It’s mother’s day. Some get to celebrate with loved ones, while others navigate the bittersweet reality of bereavement or estrangement. My heart is with you all. If there’s one lesson I’ve learned these past few years it is the importance of love, even across distance, even when it may appear to be unreciprocated. The system seeks to harness the power of mothers’ hearts through token engineering, but our hearts are wild and unruly. Our torus fields will not be tamed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today I enjoyed many blessings. I am working to move forward from a place of gratitude, so I want to acknowledge them in this short post with a few pictures from Shrine Mont, Virginia. It is a resort maintained by the Anglican Church that includes several mineral springs that were sacred to the original people’s of the Shenandoah. At some point in the past year, I looked up who founded MIT. It turns out it was a Virginia geologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Barton_Rogers">William Barton Rogers</a>. Having studied the role of water as a solvent on minerals and overseen the state geological survey in 1835, Rogers would have been familiar with these springs. His survey was made three years after Andrew Jackson put the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/hosp/learn/historyculture/index.htm">hot springs of Arkansas</a> under federal ownership. In addition to the springs, the area also features a subtle energy vortex that you can read about <a href="http://basyevortex.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=70&amp;Itemid=115">here</a>.</p>
<p>This is my second visit. I made a video of my first trip in the summer of 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<p>IndieWebCamp <a href="https://events.indieweb.org/2024/05/indiewebcamp-d%C3%BCsseldorf-2024-lPSJYTuqCdL2">Düsseldorf</a> took place this weekend, and I was inspired to work on a quick hack for demo day to show off a new feature I've been working on for <a href="https://indieauth.net/">IndieAuth</a>.</p>

<p>Since I do actually use my website to log in to different websites on a regular basis, I am often presented with the login screen asking for my domain name, which is admittedly an annoying part of the process. I don't even like having to enter my email address when I log in to a site, and entering my domain isn't any better.</p>


  


<p>So instead, I'd like to get rid of this prompt, and let the browser handle it for you! Here's a quick video of logging in to a website using my domain with the new browser API:</p>

<p></p>

<p>So how does this work?</p>

<p>For the last couple of years, there has been an ongoing effort at the Federated Identity Community Group at the W3C to build a new API in browsers that can sit in the middle of login flows. It's primarily being driven by Google for their use case of letting websites show a Google login popup dialog without needing 3rd party cookies and doing so in a privacy-preserving way. There's a lot to unpack here, more than I want to go into in this blog post. You can check out <a href="https://blog.timcappalli.me/p/preso-osw24-fedcm101/">Tim Cappalli's slides from the OAuth Security Workshop</a> for a good explainer on the background and how it works.</p>

<p>However, there are a few experimental features that are being considered for the API to accommodate use cases beyond the "Sign in with Google" case. The one that's particularly interesting to the IndieAuth use case is the <a href="https://github.com/fedidcg/FedCM/issues/240">IdP Registration API</a>. This API allows any website to register itself as an identity provider that can appear in the account chooser popup, so that a relying party website doesn't have to list out all the IdPs it supports, it can just say it supports "any" IdP. This maps to how IndieAuth is already used today, where a website can accept any user's IndieAuth server without any prior relationship with the user. For more background, check out my previous blog post "<a href="https://aaronparecki.com/2018/07/07/7/oauth-for-the-open-web">OAuth for the Open Web</a>".</p>

<p>So now, with the IdP Registration API in FedCM, your website can tell your browser that it is an IdP, then when a website wants to log you in, it asks your browser to prompt you. You choose your account from the list, the negotiation happens behind the scenes, and you're logged in!</p>


  


<p>One of the nice things about combining FedCM with IndieAuth is it lends itself nicely to running the FedCM IdP as a separate service from your actual website. I could run an IndieAuth IdP service that you could sign up for and link your website to. Since your identity is your website, your website would be the thing ultimately sent to the relying party that you're signing in to, even though it was brokered through the IdP service. Ultimately this means much faster adoption is possible, since all it takes to turn your website into a FedCM-supported site is adding a single <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag to your home page.</p>

<p>So if this sounds interesting to you, leave a comment below! The IdP registration API is currently an early experiment, and Google needs to see actual interest in it in order to keep it around! In particular, they are looking for Relying Parties who would be interested in actually using this to log users in. I am planning on launching this on <a href="https://webmention.io">webmention.io</a> as an experiment. If you have a website where users can sign in with IndieAuth, feel free to get in touch and I'd be happy to help you set up FedCM support as well!</p>

<p>Welcome to the inner workings of the Python implementation of KERI! <a href="https://github.com/ioflo/hio">HIO</a> stands for Hierarchical IO.</p>



<p>Disclaimer: this post is for a technical audience who have a need to read and understand the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust">WebOfTrust</a> Python implementation of the <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-keri-specification/">KERI</a>, <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/#go.draft-ssmith-acdc.html">ACDC</a>, and <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-cesr-specification/">CESR</a> Trust over IP (ToIP) specifications.</p>



<p>Have you ever wanted to contribute to the KERI ecosystem and been curious about the way the Python implementations are written? Or have you wanted to build on top of or modify the Python KERI codebase? </p>



<p>Not to worry, this technical series on KERI internals has your back. You will be ready to read through, understand, and build on top of the Python KERI code base once you understand the HIO async runtime, the focus of this article. </p>



<p>You are wanted as a contributor to the KERI ecosystem! The goal of this article is to assist you in becoming either a contributor to the Python implementation of KERI &amp; ACDC or an advanced user of said implementation.</p>



 HIO Introduction 



<p>HIO is an asynchronous runtime and input/output (IO) framework written by <a href="https://keri.one/131-2/">Dr. Samuel Smith</a> that supports cooperative multitasking. It is used throughout the Python implementation of the KERI suite of protocols.</p>



<p>This article serves as an introduction to the three primary classes composing the basis for HIO’s  asynchronous runtime and as the lifecycle context functions for the main task class, the <code>Doer</code>. Additionally, you will have an idea of how these concepts relate to similar concepts in Python’s AsyncIO runtime. The three HIO classes include:</p>



 
 the <code>Doist</code>, the root scheduler, 



 the <code>DoDoer</code>, the heirarchical container of <code>Doer</code> and <code>DoDoer</code> instances 



 <code>Doer</code>, the core task concept in HIO. 
 



<p>Due to its nature as the asynchronous runtime engine, HIO is found at the heart of the core Python libraries in the WebOfTrust ecosystem including the core library <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy">KERIpy</a>, the agent server <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keria">KERIA</a>, and the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/signifypy">SignifyPy</a> client companion to KERIA.</p>



<p>In order to understand the purpose of three classes mentioned above and how they compare to Python’s AsyncIO it is important to clarify terminology around concurrent and asynchronous programming in Python. As Python’s <code>async/await</code> is much more common and familiar than HIO this article starts there to introduce the concepts.</p>



 Why is HIO used in KERIpy, KERIA, and SignifyPy? 



<p>Performance, control, and features, at a high level, are the reason why HIO was used for KERIpy. HIO’s use of what are called “classic coroutines” and asynchronous buffers for I/O provide a level of control and performance that is difficult to achieve with Python’s AsyncIO implementation. An API into the timing system used for the event loop and scheduler provide tight, deterministic control over scheduling order of tasks.</p>



<p>A future article will go deeper than this short overview into the argument for using HIO and what specifically sets it apart from other async frameworks like AsyncIO, <a href="https://curio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Curio</a>, and <a href="https://trio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Trio</a>.</p>



 Async Framework Short Comparison 



<p>An asynchronous framework typically consists of a number of major abstractions including an event loop, task or coroutine, scheduler, queues for communicating between tasks, futures, callbacks, non-blocking I/O, synchronization primitives (locks, semaphores), timeouts and cancellation, and some notion of lifecycle for tasks. This article focuses specifically on the event loop, scheduler, and task abstractions in HIO and Python’s AsyncIO. </p>



 Cooperative Multitiasking 



<p>Both HIO and AsyncIO allow you to accomplish what is called “cooperative multitasking” which is where each coroutine yields control to a central scheduler so that other coroutines can be activated for their next execution. In AsyncIO the scheduler is the <code>asyncio</code> event loop and a coroutine is any function declared with the <code>async def</code> syntax. In HIO the scheduler is the <code>Doist</code> class and the coroutine is the <code>Doer</code> class.</p>



 Concurrency and parallelism in Python 



<p>When discussing concurrency or asynchronous programming it is important to distinguish between what is typically meant by concurrency and parallelism. </p>



<blockquote>
<p>Concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once.</p>



<p>Parallelism is about doing lots of things at once.</p>



<p>Not the same, but related.<br>One is about structure, one is about execution.</p>



<p>Concurrency provides a way to structure a solution to solve a problem that may (but not necessarily) be parallelizable.</p>



<p>— Rob Pike, co-inventor of the Go language</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Parallelism is a special case of concurrency. In Python <code>threading</code>, <code>multiprocessing</code>, and <code>asyncio</code> are the core packages for concurrent programming. In this post we only address the <code>asyncio</code> package, which supports what are called native coroutines.</p>



 Python’s AsyncIO package 



 Native coroutines – async/await 



<p>A native coroutine is any function that, as mentioned earlier, uses the <code>async def</code> syntax to define a function, introduced with <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0492/">PEP-492</a> in Python 3.5 (2015). Calling an <code>async def</code> function does not automatically execute the code in the function. To execute the code the <code>await</code> keyword must be used when calling the function. This instructs the <code>asyncio</code> event loop to schedule execution of the function. </p>


  import asyncio

# Native coroutine - uses the "async def" syntax to define a function
async def print_after(delay, what):
    await asyncio.sleep(delay)
    print(what)

# An asyncio-compatible main function
async def main():
    print(f"started at {time.strftime('%X')}")
    await print_after(1, 'hello')
    await print_after(2, 'world')
    print(f"finished at {time.strftime('%X')}")

# The asyncio task scheduler - uses the default asyncio event loop
asyncio.run(main())
  


<p>In Python the <code>asyncio</code> package provides the <code>run</code> function where you can run the default event loop and task scheduler with <code>asyncio.run(my_main_coroutine())</code>. </p>



<p>The image below illustrates how coroutines, the core task concept in asyncio, are run in the AsyncIO framework. </p>


 
 


<p>You have your program, the Python process, that sends tasks to the asyncio event loop with either an explicit call to <code>asyncio.create_task()</code> or use the <code>await</code> keyword to schedule a task in the <code>asyncio</code> event loop and wait for its completion within the body of the function that used the <code>await</code> keyword.</p>



<p>AsyncIO can be difficult to use correctly though it is usually easy to recognize due to most library authors targeting <code>asyncio</code> mark their async functions with <code>async def</code>. There is also the <code>@types.coroutine</code> annotation to make an existing generator function compatible with native coroutines. In order to use AsyncIO and get the performance benefits of using asyncio your whole program has to embrace the AsyncIO paradigm, meaning you use <code>async def</code> native coroutines for anything that does I/O or long-running tasks and you use <code>await</code> to schedule all coroutines.</p>



 Summary of AsyncIO 



<p>AsyncIO has a few main concepts for the async runtime, the asyncio event loop and an <code>async def</code> function as a coroutine. These basic concepts map nicely onto the HIO concepts of a <code>Doist</code>, the root scheduler in HIO, and the <code>Doer</code>, the coroutine or task concept in HIO. The main point where AsyncIO and HIO differ are that HIO has an explicit construct for creating hierarchies of tasks, the <code>DoDoer</code>. While there is no explicit construct in AsyncIO for a <code>DoDoer</code> any <code>async/await</code> coroutine could be considered to be a container for other coroutines.</p>



 Combining AsyncIO and HIO 



<p>Though <code>asyncio</code> native coroutines are not used at all in HIO the two approaches are compatible and composable. You can schedule AsyncIO tasks from a HIO task (a Doer) and you can also schedule a HIO task from an asyncio coroutine.</p>



<p>Yet first we must describe what HIO is. The subject of combining AsyncIO and HIO will be covered in a future article. This article is a short introduction to the three main classes of HIO’s async runtime implementation.</p>



 What is HIO? 


 
 


<p>HIO stands for Hierarchical IO. The README [1] describes it as weightless, hierarchical asynchronous coroutines and I/O in Python. This means that the task abstractions in HIO allow for nesting subtasks within tasks. HIO has three primary classes that make up its asynchronous runtime: <br>1. the <code>Doist</code>, or the root scheduler,<br>2. the <code>DoDoer</code>, a container holding either other <code>DoDoer</code> instances or <code>Doer</code> instances allowing you to create task hierarchies,<br>3. the <code>Doer</code>, the basic task or coroutine construct in HIO.</p>



<p>HIO makes heavy use of what are now known as “<a href="https://www.fluentpython.com/extra/classic-coroutines/">classic coroutines</a>“[2] where the scheduler uses the <code>my_coro.send(data)</code> function to send data into a <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators">Python generator function</a>. This generator function is the classic coroutine. </p>



<p>A few keywords distinguish classical coroutines including:</p>



 
 <code>yield</code>: used to pause execution of a coroutine (generator function), send a value out of a coroutine, and receive a value into a coroutine. 



 <code>yield from</code>: used when nesting generators (inner generators) to pause execution of the outer generator and pass, or delegate, conrol to a sub-generator. Once the sub-generator completes then control is passed back to the outer generator.
 
 The <code>yield from</code> keyword is very similar to the <code>await</code> keyword from AsyncIO. Both drive sub-generators and both allow consumption of values returned by sub-generators. 



 <code>await</code> does not completely replace <code>yield from</code> because <code>await</code> must be used inside a native coroutine and must be used with an awaitable object.  



 <code>yield from</code> can be used in any function and with any iterable. 
 
 
 



<p>The <code>yield</code> keyword used in the body of a Python generator function allows it to receive values from the <code>my_coro.send()</code> function, similar to how Erlang/Elixir use the OTP to pass messages between processes with <code>send</code> and <code>receive</code>. The Python <code>my_coro.send(data)</code> is the “send” and the <code>myvar = yield from</code> invocation is the “receive.” And the <code>yield from</code> keyword used in the body of a classic coroutine allows delegating to, or transferring execution to, a nested or sub-generator.</p>



<p>This classic coroutine approach HIO uses is grounded in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_concurrency">structured concurrency</a> where there are clear entry and exit points to tasks, errors in concurrently executing tasks propagate up the task chain, and clear expression of control flow within the structure of source code despite the presence of concurrency. The context methods of a HIO <code>Doer</code> task provide the clear entry and exit points as well as a clear exception handling mechanism.</p>



 Overview 



<p>The root scheduler, the Doist, processes an array of <code>Doer</code> and <code>DoDoer</code> tasks. The <code>DoDoer</code> is the hierarchical task concept, and the <code>Doer</code> is the core task concept as shown below in the diagram.</p>


 
 


<p>Your program, the Python process, runs the Doist and the Doist runs the list of tasks until they finish or the program is terminated.</p>


  # from github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy/src/keri/app/cli/directing.py
# module: keri.app.cli.directing

# receives a list of tasks for the scheduler to run
def runController(doers, expire=0.0): 
    """
    Utility Function to create doist to run doers
    """
    tock = 0.03125

    # creates the Doist, the root scheduler
    doist = doing.Doist(limit=expire, tock=tock, real=True)  
   
    # adds tasks to the Doist to run. Calling "do" runs the Doist
    doist.do(doers=doers)  

  


<p>Here is a code example of creating an array of <code>doers</code> to pass to the root scheduler, the Doist, from KERIpy. This <code>runWitness</code> function shows the set of tasks that must be created in order to run a KERIpy witness.</p>


  # from github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy/src/keri/app/cli/commands/witness/start.py
# module: keri.app.cli.commands.witness

# Function used by the CLI to run a single basic witness
def runWitness(name="witness", base="", alias="witness", bran="", tcp=5631, http=5632, expire=0.0):
    """
    Setup and run one witness
    """

    ks = keeping.Keeper(name=name, base=base, temp=False, reopen=True)

    aeid = ks.gbls.get('aeid')
    if aeid is None:
        hby = habbing.Habery(name=name, base=base, bran=bran)
    else:
        hby = existing.setupHby(name=name, base=base, bran=bran)

    hbyDoer = habbing.HaberyDoer(habery=hby)  # setup doer
    
    doers = [hbyDoer]  # list of tasks

    # extends the task list with the tasks from indirecting.setupWitness
    doers.extend(indirecting.setupWitness(alias=alias, hby=hby, tcpPort=tcp, httpPort=http)) 

    # calls the Doist root scheduler with a list of tasks
    directing.runController(doers=doers, expire=expire)
  


<p>This function creates a few tasks to be run and hands them off to the <code>Doist</code> scheduler with <code>directing.runController</code>. The scheduler then runs the tasks to completion, or infinitely, depending on the contents of the <code>recur</code> function shown below in the <code>Doer</code>.</p>



 HIO Task – a Doer 



<p>The core task concept in HIO is expressed as the <code><a href="https://github.com/ioflo/hio/blob/main/src/hio/base/doing.py#L437">Doer</a></code> class shown in the UML diagram below. The HIO scheduler, a <code>Doist</code>, runs the <code>Doer</code> task until the <code>.done</code> attribute becomes <code>True</code>. There are six context functions five of which are executed over the lifecycle of the task including <code>enter</code>, <code>recur</code>, <code>clean</code>, <code>close</code>, and <code>exit</code>. The <code>abort</code> function is only called when a task is cancelled or an exception is raised.</p>


 
 


 HIO Scheduler – the Doist 



<p>At the top of the execution hierarchy in the HIO library you find the <code><a href="https://github.com/ioflo/hio/blob/main/src/hio/base/doing.py#L19">Doist</a></code> class, the root scheduler of all task instances, or <code>Doer</code> instances. The generator returned from invoking a <code>Doer</code> is called a “deed” and is handed over to the <code>Doist</code> function. The <code>Doist</code> shown below has a list of <code>deeds</code> that are these generator functions, classic coroutines, that it runs when the <code>Doist</code> is executed.</p>


 
 


<p>To run a <code>Doist</code> you invoke the <code>.do</code> function on the <code>Doist</code> as shown below in a test adapted from HIO.</p>


  def test_doist_doers():
    """
    Test doist.do with .close of deeds
    """
    tock = 0.03125
    doist = doing.Doist(tock=tock)

    # creates a Doer, an example doer 
    doer0 = doing.ExDoer(tock=tock, tymth=doist.tymen())
    # creates a Doer, an example doer 
    doer2 = doing.ExDoer(tock=tock, tymth=doist.tymen())
    doers = [doer0, doer1]

    doist.do(doers=doers)  # run the Doist
    assert doer0.done == True
  


 Context Functions 



<p>The six context functions in the <code>Doer</code> are run by the <code>enter</code> and <code>exit</code> functions of the <code>Doist</code> as well as the <code>do</code> function of the <code>Doer</code>. Each of these functions serve as a lifecycle hook for a different time in the execution of the <code>Doer</code>. The <code><a href="https://github.com/ioflo/hio/blob/main/src/hio/base/doing.py#L541">.do</a></code> function reproduced below shows where each context function is executed after calling <code>Doer.do</code>. Take special notice of the <code>while</code> loop inside of the <code>try/except</code> block. This is the loop that continues to run the body of the <code>Doer</code>, the function or generator that does the work of the <code>Doer</code>.</p>


  # from github.com/ioflo/hio/src/hio/base.doing.py
class Doer(tyming.Tymee):
    ...

    def do(self, tymth, *, tock=0.0, **opts):
        """
        Generator method to run this doer. Calling this method returns generator.
        Interface matches generator function for compatibility.

                    tyme = (yield (self.tock))  # yields .tock then waits for next send
                    self.done = self.recur(tyme=tyme)   # (2) second context function, recur

        except GeneratorExit:  # close context, forced exit due to .close
            self.close()  # (3) third context function, close

        except Exception as ex:  # abort context, forced exit due to uncaught exception
            self.abort(ex=ex)   # (4) fourth context function, abort
            raise

        else:  # clean context
            self.clean()  # (5) fifth context function, clean

        finally:  # exit context, exit, unforced if normal exit of try, forced otherwise
            self.exit()  # (6) sixth context function, exit

        # return value of yield from or StopIteration.value indicates completion
        return self.done  # Only returns done state if normal return not close or abort raise
  


<p>In the normal execution of a <code>Doer</code> the <code>.do()</code> function calls, in this order, <code>enter</code>, <code>recur</code>, <code>clean</code>, and then <code>exit</code>. The <code>close</code> context function is only executed when it is explicitly called by some higher level construct such as a <code>DoDoer</code> or the <code>Doist</code> scheduler itself.</p>



<p>In an error case, or abnormal execution of a <code>Doer</code>, the <code>abort</code> context function is called. This can also be called as a part of normal execution of a program to catch a shutdown signal to instruct a <code>DoDoer</code> or a <code>Doist</code> to perform a graceful shutdown.</p>



 HIO DoDoer – where task hierarchies are defined 



<p>This post touches lightly on <code>DoDoer</code>s to say that the <code>DoDoer</code> provides hierarchical task management which means you can nest tasks for a clear hierarchy of task execution for groups of tasks. A future article will detail the definition and usage of the <code>DoDoer</code>.</p>



 AsyncIO vs HIO – How do they compare? 



<p>Classic coroutines are very powerful constructs that provide a richer control flow construct as compared to AsyncIO’s <code>async def</code> coroutine construc. This is because you can use any number of <code>yield</code> or <code>yield from</code> statements in the body of a classic coroutine, which provides you with the ability to custom-fit the execution of a generator-based coroutine to your specific use case. The <code>async/await</code> syntax does a similar thing for you, yet with a standard syntax that you cannot customize.</p>



<p>With HIO you can also repeatedly accept information into a classic coroutine instance through the <code>yield from</code> syntax. The fact that classic coroutines are just generator functions means you have full control over iteration of that generator, and all of it’s contained state including any state it has closed over, from an async context with all the power of Python iterators.</p>



<p>For example, you could run a classic coroutine any arbitrary number of times within a custom scheduler depending on special rules and have fine-grained access to what is sent into the coroutine with the <code>.send()</code> function.</p>



<p>Yet with this additional power comes the potential to have complicated and hard to understand control flow. It is understandable why there would be so much support in the Python community for a simpler, less powerful syntax, which is what <code>async/await</code> is. The linked <a href="https://www.fluentpython.com/extra/classic-coroutines/">article</a>[2] from Luciano Ramalho goes in depth on the features of both classic coroutines and Python’s AsyncIO.</p>



 Wrap up and Next Steps 



<p>This article focused on the “what” of the async framework side of HIO, specifically the three primary classes at the core of the async runtime in HIO, the <code>Doist</code> scheduler, <code>DoDoer</code> hierarchical task container, and the <code>Doer</code> task class. The raw power of classic coroutines significantly influenced the decision to use them in HIO as well as in KERIpy, KERIA, and SignifyPy. Yet, this is not an either-or, all-or-nothing situation. You can use HIO and AsyncIO together. </p>



<p>Major topics not covered in this article that are important to understand HIO include details of the <code>DoDoer</code> and the network and file I/O capabilities of the HIO package.</p>



<p>Future articles will delve deeper into the “why” of HIO, the rationale behind HIO, how and when to use it properly, as well as how to use HIO and AsyncIO together. To gain a deeper understanding of HIO one of your next steps would be to read some of the <a href="https://github.com/ioflo/hio/tree/main/tests">tests</a> in the HIO source code repository, specifically the <code><a href="https://github.com/ioflo/hio/blob/main/tests/base/test_doist.py#L30">test_doist_once</a></code> and <code><a href="https://github.com/ioflo/hio/blob/main/tests/base/test_doist.py#L691">test_nested_doers</a></code> tests.</p>

 The “oil lights” of cryptographic key management.  TL;DR   KERI is an open, decentralized protocol for discovery, recovery, and management of cryptographic keys. KERI enables anyone to digitally sign digital things and to verify what others have signed, without the need for shared networks, blockchains, registries, platforms, or identity providers.  KERI solves seven hard problems of key management: Rotation, Recovery, Detectability, Discovery, Delegability, Revocability, and Multi-Signature.  KERI has three Detectability functions — Witnesses, Watchers, and Anchored Issuances — that are like the oil light of a car: they detect key compromise and malicious behaviors of Signers and service providers.  <p>With KERI Detectability functions…</p><p>Signers can&nbsp;detect:</p>  Their own compromised keys when used by hackers for&nbsp;signing;  Their own compromised keys when used by hackers to rotate, delegate, or revoke their signing&nbsp;keys.  <p>And Verifiers can&nbsp;detect:</p>  Compromised Signers;  Malicious Signers;  Their own malicious or compromised verification service provider.  <p>Without KERI Anchored Issuances in particular, if a Signer suspects key compromise and performs a rotation, it cannot determine which issuances were made fraudulently, and must revoke and reissue all previously issued credentials. (!)</p><p>With KERI Anchored Issuances, fraudulently issued credentials will not successfully verify before or after key rotations, whereas authentically issued credentials will continue to successfully verify, even after an unlimited number of key rotations.</p> What is&nbsp;KERI? <p>KERI — Key Event Receipt Infrastructure — is a new (2019), open, decentralized protocol for discovering, recovering, and managing <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-a-cryptographic-key/">cryptographic keys</a>. KERI enables people, organizations, and things to <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/understanding-digital-signatures">sign</a> digital things and verify what others have signed, without the need for shared networks, blockchains, registries, platforms, or identity providers.</p><p>With KERI, Signers and Verifiers worldwide maintain their own infrastructure without anything in common, but they do share one game-changing thing: a protocol for discovering the Signer’s current key state. This enables Verifiers to securely confirm that a piece of data has been signed by a particular Signer, and that it hasn’t been tampered with, revoked, or&nbsp;expired.</p><p>KERI is “end verifiable”; the means through which data travels needn’t be secure for it to still be verifiably authentic when it arrives at its destination. KERI is zero trust, enabling objective verifiability without subjective trust, and it creates no centralized troves of valuable data. KERI is quantum-resistant and uses existing cryptography and cloud infrastructure.</p><p>In short, KERI brings the ability to distinguish fake from real in the digital realm, across networks, borders, and boundaries of all&nbsp;kinds.</p> Seven Hard Problems of Key Management <p>KERI address seven hard problems of key management, listed below. Most were previously not solvable in a decentralized manner, and some not in a centralized one.</p><p>Seven hard problems (with the KERI solution):</p>  Rotation (change current keys for new, without re-issuing past issuances)  Recovery (from private key loss or compromise, without re-issuing past issuances)  Detectability (of key compromise or malicious Signer behavior)  Discovery (just-in-time discovery of key&nbsp;state)  Delegability (directly from one Signer/key controller to&nbsp;another)  Revocability (decentralized, instant, with&nbsp;privacy)  Multi-signature (weighted m-of-n, verifiable)   Detectability: Witnesses, Watchers, &amp; Anchored Issuances  Detectability Is the ‘Oil Light’ of Key Management <p>Together, KERI Witnesses, Watchers, and Anchored Issuances, all described below, enable Detectability. Detectability is like the oil light of a car: ignore it, disconnect it, or omit it at your peril, because it is the most critical indicator on your dashboard.</p><p>Removing Witnesses, Watchers, and Anchored Issuances from a system removes Detectability.</p><p>Without Detectability, Signers cannot&nbsp;detect:</p>  Their own compromised keys when used by hackers for&nbsp;signing;  Their own compromised keys when used by hackers to rotate, delegate, or revoke the Signer’s&nbsp;keys.  <p>And Verifiers cannot&nbsp;detect:</p>  A Signer’s compromised keys;  Malicious Signers;  Their own malicious or compromised verification service provider.   What Are Witnesses? <p>KERI <a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#a998">Witnesses</a> are secure, distributed replicas of a Signer’s <a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#7c43">key event log</a>. They are established (built or bought) and controlled by a <a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#2627">Signer</a> (also a “key controller” or “issuer”). A Signer can be anyone or anything, anywhere.</p><p>Witnesses make separate, additional replicated points of verification available to <a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#1f72">Verifiers</a>, enabling Verifiers to detect both compromised and malicious behaviors by Signers. Witnesses can be web servers, distributed databases, blockchains, or any other addressable data&nbsp;source.</p><p>To compromise a KERI <a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#7344">identifier</a>, each of its Witnesses must also be compromised.</p><p>There are no limits or requirements as to whether a Signer uses Witnesses at all or how many; the KERI protocol simply enables any number of Witnesses to be established, deployed however the Signer chooses, and for Verifiers to verify that all Witnesses are acting in unanimity about the Signer’s key&nbsp;state.</p> What Are Watchers? <p>KERI <a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#0d21">Watchers</a> are services established (built or bought) by a Verifier — who can be anyone or anything anywhere — that enable the Verifier to confidently rely on what their own service providers are telling them about a Signer’s <a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#7344">key&nbsp;state</a>.</p><p>Watchers help Verifiers avoid the single-oracle problem: if you have only one source of truth, you cannot know if that source has been compromised or is acting maliciously (deliberately lying to you). When multiple distinct Watchers all report the same key state of a Signer, it can be more safely relied upon. Having Watchers removes a tempting single point of vulnerability for&nbsp;hackers.</p><p>As with Witnesses, there are no limits or requirements as to whether Watchers are used at all or how many; the KERI protocol simply enables any number of Watchers to be established and deployed however&nbsp;desired.</p> Anchored Issuances: A Breakthrough in Detecting and Preventing the Use of Stolen&nbsp;Keys <p>Another critical element of Detectability, separate from Witnesses and Watchers, is “Anchored Issuances” (referred to as “seals” in the KERI white&nbsp;paper).</p><p>When issued credentials are properly anchored in one’s Key Event Log (KEL) and properly witnessed and watched, it becomes impossible for a hacker of your private keys to use them without your detection; the unauthorized issuances will not successfully verify. With un-anchored / “unbound” issuances, hackers can use stolen private keys as they please with zero detectability and, unfortunately, every issuance they make will successfully verify.</p><p>Akin to a check register, Anchored Issuances provide a secure record of issued credentials that can be instantly and cryptographically confirmed by Verifiers. No other system we are aware of provides detectability or prevention of the use of stolen private&nbsp;keys.</p> No Detectability? Rotate, Revoke, and Re-Issue Everything. (Really) <p>Some alternative key management systems borrow KERI’s primary functions — <a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#0a82">pre-rotation</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#909c">SCIDS</a>, etc. — but forgo its Detectability functions. For them and for all non-KERI key management systems, a big future headache awaits: if a Signer suspects key compromise and performs a rotation, there is no way to distinguish valid issuances from invalid ones — they will all continue to verify successfully — so a Signer must revoke and reissue all previously issued credentials. (!)</p><p>That is, if a Signer wishes to maintain a positive reputation for its credentials. Revoking and reissuing everything would likely be a user experience nightmare, which alone defeats the purpose of having pre-rotation. Pre-rotation is arguably KERI’s greatest innovation, but does not achieve its full potential without Detectability.</p> Can’t We Just Rotate More&nbsp;Often? <p>Yes, but it won’t help much. KERI pre-rotation can be done repeatedly without downstream costs or consequences for KERI identifiers, a breathtaking breakthrough in key management. But… while a Signer’s more-frequent rotation might attempt to repair one vulnerability — compromise of the Signer’s keys — it does not address other vulnerabilities listed in the “KERI Detectability” section, and it still leaves the ugly problem of revoking and re-issuing everything if a compromise is suspected. In other words, removing Detectability leaves significant holes in the security model no matter how often a Signer rotates their&nbsp;keys.</p><p>Such a tradeoff may be acceptable for less critical use cases or at smaller scale, but is likely unacceptable for most organizations.</p> In Conclusion <p>KERI Witnesses, Watchers, and Anchored Issuances are the ‘oil lights’ of cryptographic key management, enabling robust detectability of malicious or compromised digital signing behaviors for both Signers and Verifiers. KERI Anchored Issuances goes beyond detection to full-on prevention, actively blocking the use of stolen private keys for credential signing.</p><p>KERI Detectability brings critical advances in key management specifically and cybersecurity generally, and should be seriously considered for inclusion within any comprehensive cybersecurity, identity, or key management system.</p>

<p>Back on March 28, I <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/03/pgxn-language-choices/" title="PGXN v2: Go or Rust?">asked</a> the Postgres community whether new services for
<a href="https://github.com/orgs/pgxn/projects/1/views/1" title="PGXN v2 Project">PGXN v2</a> should be written in <a href="https://go.dev" title="The Go Programming Language">Go</a>, <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org" title="Rust Programming Language">Rust</a>, or “some of each”. I
went so far as to create a <a href="https://dev.star.vote/tqkv3v/results" title="Poll: What language should PGXN v2 tools and services be written in?">poll</a>, which ran through April 12. A month later
you might reasonably be wondering what became of it. Has David been refusing
to face reality and accept the results?</p>
<p>The answer is “no”. Or at least I don’t think so. Who among us really knows
ourselves. Since it closed, the <a href="https://dev.star.vote/tqkv3v/results" title="Poll: What language should PGXN v2 tools and services be written in?">poll</a> has provided the results since it
closed, but I suspect few have looked. So here they are:</p>

<p>I don’t know whether some Rust brigade descended upon the poll, but the truth
is that the outcome was blindingly apparent within a day of posting the poll.
So much so that I decided to get ahead of things and try writing a <a href="https://github.com/pgcentralfoundation/pgrx" title="pgrx: Build Postgres Extensions with Rust!">pgrx</a>
extension. I released <a href="https://pgxn.org/dist/jsonschema/" title="The jsonschema Postgres Extension on PGXN">jsonschema</a> on PGXN on April 30. Turned out to be kind
of fun, and the pgrx developers kindly answered all my questions and even made
a new release to simplify integration testing, now included in the
<a href="https://github.com/pgxn/docker-pgxn-tools?tab=readme-ov-file#pgrx-build-test" title="pgrx-build-test: Build and test a pgrx extension"><code>pgrx-build-test</code></a> utility in the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/pgxn/pgxn-tools">pgxn-tools</a> Docker image.</p>
<p>But I digress. As a result of this poll and chatting with various holders of
stakes at <a href="https://tembo.io" title="Tembo: Goodbye Database Sprawl, Hello Postgres">work</a> and haunting the <a href="https://postgresteam.slack.com/archives/C056ZA93H1A" title="Postgres Slack/#extensions: Extensions and extension-related accessories">#extensions</a> Slack channel, I plan to use
Rust for all new PGXN projects — unless there is an overwhelmingly

<p></p>
<p>There is a war going on. Humanity and nature are on one side and Big Tech is on the other. The two sides are not opposed. They are orthogonal. The human side is horizontal and the Big Tech side is vertical.*</p>
<p>The human side is personal, social, self-governed, heterarchical, open, and grounded in the physical world. Its model is nature, and the cooperative contexts in which competition, creation, and destruction happen in the natural world.</p>
<p>The Big Tech side is corporate, industrial, hierarchical, competitive, mechanistic, extractive, and closed, even though it produces many positive-sum products and services that are good for people and good for nature. It is also, being competitive and rewarding toward winner-take-most outcomes, dominated by giants.</p>
<p>This war has been fought over many other things in the past, especially in tech. But AI is the big one right now—and perhaps the biggest one of all time.</p>
<p>Over the long run, both sides will win, because we need the best of what both bring to the world’s big round table. In the past, this has happened in countless markets, countries, polities, societies, and other contexts. In tech it happened with the conflict between PCs and mainframes, between the open and public Internet and closed private networks, and between open operating systems and closed ones. None of those conflicts have final outcomes, but they have arrived at stable and cooperative states. They arrived at those states because everyone recognized that people can do more with their own tools than those big entities can do on theirs, or by using people as extracted resources.</p>
<p>This conflict is perhaps best represented by the ironies that have been at work within OpenAI and Sam Altman, its prior and current CEO. We can also see it with sparkling clarity in something amazing that Sam said near the close of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9mJuUkhUzk">his keynote</a> at the first <a href="https://devday.openai.com/">OpenAI Developer Conference</a>, in November of last year:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Lets unpack that.</p>
<p>Individual empowerment means exactly what it says. Agency&nbsp;is the ability to take action or to choose what action to take&nbsp;(<a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/agency">Cambridge Dictionary</a>).&nbsp;Scale means growth toward ubiquity.</p>
<p>You have individual empowerment and agency when you ride your bike, drive your car, mow your lawn, or button your shirt. You also have it when you work on your laptop, phone, and other smart rectangles. Scale means your power and agency will grow to the max while the same will happen for nearly everyone else. Scale for you alone won’t cut it. When most of us have it, that’s scale.</p>
<p>Technologies <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding_Media">extend us</a>. They enlarge our capacities in the world. Intelligence is one of those capacities. So is memory. Your rectangles help a lot with both. That’s why those have already scaled to ubiquity, or close enough.</p>
<p>AI will do the same, but only if it’s personal. Not if it’s&nbsp; just “personalized.”</p>
<p>As Jamie Smith made clear <a href="https://www.customerfutures.com/p/customer-futures-perspective-i-have">here</a> a year ago, “your personal AI isn’t really personal.”</p>
<p>ChatGPT4 doesn’t know that yet. I can tell because I just asked:</p>
<blockquote><p>Me:<br>
What is “personal AI”?</p>
<p>ChatGPT4:<br>
“Personal AI” refers to artificial intelligence systems that are designed to serve individual users through personalized interactions and services. These AI systems learn from the specific preferences, behaviors, and needs of their users to offer more tailored assistance, recommendations, or information. The goal of personal AI is to enhance user experience by adapting to unique personal profiles.</p>
<p>There are various applications of personal AI, including:</p>
 
 Virtual Assistants: Like Siri, Google Assistant, and others, these AIs help with daily tasks such as scheduling, reminders, searching information, and controlling smart home devices, all customized to the user’s habits and preferences. 
 Recommendation Systems: Used in streaming services like Netflix or shopping platforms like Amazon, these AI systems analyze your past behavior to recommend movies, shows, or products you might like. 
 Healthcare: Personal AI can track individual health metrics and provide personalized advice, monitor conditions, or even alert medical professionals if needed. 
 Learning and Development: In education, personal AI can adapt learning materials to the pace and learning style of the student, offering a customized educational experience. 
 Gaming: AI in gaming can adapt to provide a challenge tailored to the player’s skill level or alter the game narrative based on choices made by the player. 
 
<p>The development of personal AI focuses on enhancing user engagement by creating more intuitive and responsive interactions that feel uniquely suited to each individual.</p></blockquote>
<p>For a second opinion, I asked Google’s <a href="https://gemini.google.com/">Gemini</a> the same question.</p>
<blockquote><p>Me:<br>
What is “personal AI”?</p>
<p>Gemini:<br>
Personal AI refers to artificial intelligence designed to assist and interact with a specific individual. It’s essentially your own AI companion that learns about you and tailors its services to your needs. Here are some key aspects of personal AI:</p>
 
 Personalization: Unlike general-purpose AI assistants, personal AI focuses on you. It learns from your interactions, preferences, and habits to become more helpful over time. 
 Focus on Memory and Knowledge: Some personal AI systems aim to become an extension of your mind. They can store your memories, knowledge, and experiences, making them readily accessible and even usable to help with tasks like writing or communication. 
 Varied Applications: Personal AI can have a wide range of applications. Imagine an AI that helps you: 
 Organize your life: Manage schedules, appointments, and reminders. 
 Boost productivity: Assist with tasks, research, and communication. 
 Enhance creativity: Help you brainstorm ideas or generate creative content. 
 Improve learning: Personalize learning experiences and provide targeted information. 
 
<p>Privacy Concerns: Storing personal data on an AI raises concerns about privacy and security.</p>
<p>Overall, personal AI holds promise for a future where technology seamlessly integrates with our lives, offering personalized assistance and support.</p></blockquote>
<p>To both companies, personal AI is a personalized service—from them. It’s not something you own and control. It’s not about individual empowerment and agency. It doesn’t extend you. It’s hired prosthesis: an extension of them rather than of you.</p>
<p>Let’s name the category: AIaaS—AI as a Service.</p>
<p>But hats off. OpenAI and Gemini do amazing jobs. So do lots of other AI services by wannabe giants. I use AI every day to improve what I write, to generate and fix images, to answer questions that old-fashioned search engines can’t answer or suck at. I even pay extra for some of it (such as ChatGPT4 and Adobe’s Creative Suite). And it seems they all get better, all the time, at everything. Won’t personalization be good enough, eventually?</p>
<p>No. Because they aren’t you. They also aren’t yours, so they can’t extend you. They can seem to. But they don’t. They also don’t have access to most of your private life. Nor should they.</p>
<p>But your private life could use some AI help. For example—</p>
 
 Schedules, including on your calendars, past and future 
 Health data, including all your medical reports, prescriptions, appointments, insurance information, past and present providers, plus what your watch, phone, and other devices record about you 
 Financial records, including bills, receipts, taxes, and anything called an account that involves money 
 Travel, including all the movements your phone (and <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/data-privacy-all-the-ways-your-cellphone-carrier-tracks-you-and-how-to-stop-it/">phone company</a>), watch, and <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/blog/privacy-nightmare-on-wheels-every-car-brand-reviewed-by-mozilla-including-ford-volkswagen-and-toyota-flunks-privacy-test/">car</a> record about where you go and where you’ve been 
 Work—past and present, including whatever HR systems know or knew about you 
 Contacts—all the people, businesses, and other entities you know 
 Business relationships, with brokers, retailers, service providers, whatever 
 Subscriptions, including all those “just $1 for the first four weeks” offers you’ve accepted, plus other forms of <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2020/10/17/unscrew/">screwage</a> that are stock-in-trade for companies selling subscription systems to businesses. 
 Property, including all the stuff on your shelves, floors, closets, garages, and storage spaces—plus your stocks and real estate. 
 
<p>It’s not easy to visualize what a personal AI might do for those, but let’s try. Here’s how Microsoft’s Copilot (or whatever it’s called this week) did it for me before I got rid of all its misspellings and added my own hunks of text:</p>
<p></p>
<p>All that stuff is data. But most of it is scattered between apps and clouds belonging to Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, phone companies, cable companies, car makers, health care systems, insurance companies, banks, credit card companies, retailers, and other systems that are not yours. And most of them also think that data is theirs and not yours.</p>
<p>To collect and manage all that stuff, you need tools that don’t yet exist: tools that are yours and not theirs. We could hardly begin to imagine those tools before AI came along. Now we can.</p>
<p>For example, you should be able to take a picture of the books on your shelves and have a complete record of what those books are and where you got them. You’ll know where you got them because you have a complete history of what you bought, where and from whom. You should be able to point your camera in your closets, at the rugs on your floors, at your furniture, at the VIN number of your car that’s visible under your windshield, at your appliances and plumbing fixtures, and have your AI tell you what those are, or at least make far more educated guesses than you can make on your own.</p>
<p>Yes, your AI should be able to tap into external databases and AI systems for help, but without divulging identity information or other private data. Those services should be dependent variables, not independent ones. For full individual empowerment and agency, you need to be independent. So does everyone else with personal AI.</p>
<p>Now imagine having a scanner that you can feed every bill, every receipt, every subscription renewal notice, and have AI software that tells you what’s what with each of them, and sorts records into the places they belong.</p>
<p>Ever notice that the Amazon line items on your credit card bill not only aren’t itemized, but don’t match Amazon’s online record of what you ordered? Your personal AI can sort that out. It can help say which are business and personal expenses, which are suspicious in some way, what doesn’t add up, and much more.</p>
<p>Your personal AI should be able to answer questions like, How many times have I had lunch at this place? Who was I with? When was it we drove to see so-and-so in Wisconsin? What route did we take? What was that one car we rented that we actually liked?</p>
<p>Way back in 1995, when our family first got on the Internet over dial-up, using the first graphical browsers on our PC, and e-commerce began to take off with Amazon, eBay, and other online retailers, my wife asked an essential question: Why can’t I have my own shopping cart that I take from site to site?</p>
<p>Twenty-nine years later, we still don’t have the answer, because every retailer wants you to use its own. And we’re stuck in that system. It’s the same system that has us separately consenting to what sites ironically call “your privacy choices.” And aren’t.</p>
<p>There are countless nice things we can’t have in the digital world today because we aren’t people there. We are accounts. And we are reduced to accounts by every entity that requires a login and password.</p>
<p><a href="https://dsearls.medium.com/beyond-the-web-b33518312876">This system</a> is a legacy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model">client-server</a>, a euphemism for slave-master. We might also call it calf-cow, because that’s how we relate to businesses with which we have accounts. And that model is leveraged on the Web like this:</p>
<p></p>
<p>We go to sites for the milk of content and free cookies, whether we want them or not. We are also just “users.”</p>
<p>In the client-server world, servers get scale. Clients have no more scale than what each account—each cow—separately allows. Sure, users get lots of benefits, but scale across many cows is not one of them. And no, “login with Google” and “login with Facebook” are just passes that let calves of ruling cows wander into vassal pastures.</p>
<p>For individual empowerment and scale to happen, we need to be self-sovereign and independent. Personal AI can give that to us. It can do that by solving problems such as the ones listed above, and by working as agents that represent us as human beings—rather than mere users—when we engage with Big Tech’s cows.</p>
<p>This will be a fight at first, because the cows think they run all of nature and not just their own farms. And $trillions are being invested in the same old cattle industry, with AI painted all over the new barns. Comparatively speaking, close to nothing is going toward giving independent and self-sovereign individuals the kind of power and scale Sam Altman says he wants to give us but can’t because he’s on the big cow side of this thing.</p>
<p>So where do we start?</p>
<p>First, with open source code and open standards. We have some already. <a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3/">Llama 3</a>, from <a href="https://ai.meta.com/">Meta AI</a>, is “your own intelligent assistant,” and <a href="https://www.thealgorithmicbridge.com/p/openai-rules-the-changes-but-meta">positions Meta as a more open and user-friendly</a> cow than OpenAI. Meta is still on the top-down Big Tech side of the war we’re in. But hell, we can use what they’ve got. So let’s play with it.</p>
<p>Here on the ground there are all these (with quotage lifted from their sites or reviews such as <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3673976/13-open-source-projects-transforming-ai-and-machine-learning.html">this one</a>)—</p>

<p>—and lots of others that readers can tell me about. Do that and I will add links later. This is a work in progress.</p>
<p>Below all of those we still need something Linux-like that will become the open base on which lots of other stuff runs.

I got recruited by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rezarassool/">Reza Rassool</a>, Kwaai’s founder and chair, because he believes personal AI is required to make <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Intention_Economy">The Intention Economy </a>finally happen. So that was a hard offer to refuse. Kwaai also has a large, growing, and active community, which I believe is necessary, cool, and very encouraging.</p>
<p>As with most (maybe all) of the projects listed above, Kwaai is a grass-roots effort by human beings on the natural, human, and horizontal side of a battle with giants who would rather give us personalized AI than have us meet them in a middle to which we will bring personal AI powers of our own. In the long run, we will meet in that middle, because personal AI will be better for everyone than personalized AI alone.</p>
<p>Watch us prove it. Better yet, join the effort.</p>
 
<p>*I am indebted to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lavonnereimer/">Lavonne Reimer</a> for introducing and co-thinking the horizontal vs. vertical frame, and look forward eagerly to her own writings and lecturings on the topic.</p>

<p>Since this is my blog, it seems like an appropriate place to tell the story from my particular point of view. For now, I’m giving myself leeway to share these loose, stream of consciousness “notes” – observations, pictures, mullings over – a work in progress. If this upsets or bores you, feel free to take a break from my blog and check back later in the summer or fall. Hopefully by then, I’ll have found my new footing.</p>

<p>On the way down to the Shenandoah yesterday, I was listening again to the biography of Elizebeth Friedman, a skilled codebreaker, who with her husband William laid the groundwork for cryptanalysis in the twentieth century. They were initially based at Riverbank Labs on the Fox River outside of Chicago, a stone’s throw from the future site of Fermi Lab.</p>

</p>
<p>The secretive Colonel Fabyan founded one of the first Defense Department think tanks in the 1910s (pre-Alfred Loomis), cultivating ties with the University of Chicago. He used his fortune to underwrite private research into plant and fruit fly genetics , bone structure, x-rays, and acoustics, the latter in partnership with Wallace Sabine. You can still purchase precision tuning forks from Riverbank Labs.</p>

<p>What took up much of the Colonel’s attention was research into the Baconian cipher, supposedly encrypted messages about Elizabethan England hidden in Shakespeare’s first folio. It was work on this cipher that eventually led to Elizebeth and William’s future careers in codebreaking.</p>

<p>William went on to found the NSA. As a team, he and Elizebeth solved complex puzzles – uniting as an extended complementary mind. That, I think, is what is intended with AR LARPy civic gaming. Maybe we can get out ahead of Niantic, Nvidia, the CIA, the Vatican…and untangle some interdimensional knots on our own?</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>I invite you to to consider my oversharing in that context. It’s an invitation into a collective puzzle-solving game. The one trick is we don’t have the box top image, and we don’t know what we are supposed to be making with all of these seemingly random loose parts.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>Anyway, I’m going to make these notes for myself at the very least. I know looking back months or years later with more context, makes all the difference.</p>

<p>Settlement was yesterday. I guess shouldn’t have been surprised that the office where we were to sign the documents to finalize the sale of the family home was in the Penn Mutual Life Insurance Building, founded in 1847. Think of the probability and stochastic modeling upon which the industry was built, as well as its ties to web3 through parametric deals that run on ubiquitous sensor networks.</p>

<p>The massive complex takes up an entire block and sits on the south side of Walnut (tree, choice theory) opposite Independence Hall (sovereign agents). It was in a Berkshire Hathaway Real Estate office, evidently they are under The Trident Group. As the notary quipped, “Warren Buffett owns us all.”</p>

<p>A close friend of my husband’s grandfather, Phil Carret, was a role model for Buffett. Carret, then in his 90s, came to our wedding. He helped create the world of mutual funds and was a solar eclipse chaser all his life. I continue to think automated financial markets, linked to collectivity and mutualism, are part of the superorganism emergence trajectory. Gates, Buffett, and their “Giving Pledge” is, in my opinion less about philanthropy, and more about using open source software, sensors, web3, and social impact data, to catalyze new forms of informational “life.”</p>

<p>Out in front is a random sign for “The Bagel Factory,” but there was no retail store anywhere on the block that I could see. It reminded me of the symbolic everything bagel in the Academy Award winning film “Everything Everywhere All At Once.”</p>

<p>After it was all over, my not-quite ex husband, and I parted ways surrounded by the bronze reliefs that comprised a massive narrative portal. An auspicious place, I suppose, to step forward into what comes next.</p>

<p>I couldn’t not cross the street to take one last look at the iconic symbol of freeDOM with its clock and its bell giving form to how we perceive “reality.” After taking the photo below, I turned to walk back to the car when I spied a piece of Bitcoin sticker art stuck to a pseudo-colonial lamp post, above it (upside down) was another sticker for Matter CBD, an organic cannabis outfit based southern Oregon where the growers, Cleve Backster-style, sing and talk to their plants.</p>

<p>Upside down matter in an era of prescribed plant medicine for altered consciousness where tokens masquerade as money, but are perhaps actually cells of some as yet indescribable life form jumping off bibliometry (Eugene Garfield) and maybe geoengineering? How to account for this sticker – a slightly blurry Bitcoin stencil on a scan of an old library check-out card (also upside down with multiple dates from the height of altered state / human potential 60s and 70s) with a jet plane flying below it all? Folks who know more about numerology, do the featured dates have any significance to you?</p>

<p>I kept walking, on past the American Philosophical Society, an off-shoot of the Royal Society laying out what is proper/acceptable science, while keeping esoteric objects like Kelpius’s Horologium of Achaz away from prying eyes. There you have good old Ben in the alcove, Philadelphia’s business, civic, and intellectual patriarch.</p>

<p>And in the next block, flanking Independence Hall to the east is the Bourse, once a commodities exchange, now an upscale tourist food court. The xoxo sculpture out front reminds me of Galia’s digital heart tokens – part of “the city that loves you back” PR campaign I suppose. Affection as tradable commodity. Boy, I got shorted this round for sure. As if to further sour my entanglement with the city, I came back to a parking ticket on my windshield. I’ve maybe gotten one other in my thirty plus years here, and I still had a half hour paid up. Stupid “smart” parking tech. I guess their sham will be the final dues I pay for my “freeDOM.”</p>

<p>After packing the last of my things into the car, and giving my honey locust street tree one more big hug, I headed to I-95 south. There’s part of me that hopes the children who will grow up in its lacy shade will decorate the sidewalk with chalk art as my child once did. For a time, 24th Street was a wonderful place to be.</p>
<p>

</p>

<p>

</p>
<p>I ended up pulling off at the University City exit to say good-bye to Bartram’s Garden where I worked for seventeen years until the lockdowns started stealing things from my life. I wanted to get a jar of local honey to sweeten the parting and see my favorite trees. The tide was in, so no mudlarking this time around. I gathered a bit of compost from inside the ancient yellow wood and rubbed it into my hands, I found a walnut with a hole that looks like a twinned portal and put it in my backpack as a keepsake. When I found my favorite, a majestic London Plane, there was the trickster energy, again. It was hosting a piece of outdoor art featuring a fox with a quizzical expression. Well played Philadelphia, well played.</p>

</p>
<p>For the past two nights I have been camping at Bear Den off the Appalachian Trail outside Blumont, VA. The site was the former summer estate of a wealthy DC OB-GYN and his opera singer wife. It sits on veins of milky white quartz. A few miles south is Weather Mountain, a Cold War bunker for the federal government. According to a local history write up in the lodge, Mahlon Loomis, a rather visionary nineteenth century Boston dentist conducted experiments transmitting wireless communications between two hills nearby, decades before Marconi, using gilded kites!</p>

<p>It’s been cold for May, and rainy. But my tent stayed dry and between the showers I explored the grounds and went out to the rocky overlook and gathered up plants to make a heart. I spied a fire pit with lots of charcoal. So, I decided to make one with that in honor of my friend Sean and his family who use biochar to feed the garden beds on their small farm in Washington State.</p>
<p>

</p>

<p>

</p>
<p>The lodge’s volunteer caretaker found it and was excitedly telling me about it. She said she took photos to send to her boyfriend, and was pointing it out to the incoming hikers, including a couple who said they’d recently relocated to Harpers Ferry from Washington State, which closes the circle. This heart has rose petals, wood sorrel, bramble blossoms, sassafras, puffballs, hemlock cones, fern, and quartz.</p>
<p>

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>

</p>
<p>I need to pack up my tent and head a bit farther down the road to Bayse. I hear conversations of families across the clearing hauling dripping blankets and debating the merits of camping after a wet, cold night. I remember those days. I’m not sure we ever had a camping trip with good weather. Now I am a solo traveler with my stuffed bear and my house plants. I will see what it feels like to be on my own reconnaissance, finding my own grounding and my own views.</p>

<p></p>



<p>I’ll be leaving Philadelphia tomorrow after the house closing paperwork is signed. The cleaners are getting it ready for its new family. A chapter closes, a new one opens. I’ll slowly make my way down to Little Rock, camping along the way. After three back-to-back, three-day, 1,300-mile u-haul drives in as many weeks, I’m sick of bland hotels with oddly coded decor and ready to sleep under the stars without worrying if someone broke into the truck while I was sleeping.</p>







<p>I built in a few extra days to poke around Oak Ridge outside Knoxville and see the colossal Athena in Nashville’s 1931 Parthenon replica with the snakey Erichthonius (born of Hephasteus’s semen falling to the soul). Interesting allusions to biogeochemistry and the origins of life in a city growing by leaps and bound on economies of biotech and blockchain health systems. </p>



<p>Yesterday I hit REI and got some new Tevas a year after my 20-year old pair gave up the ghost. I need shower shoes for the campgrounds, and Arkansas lakes are clear with sharp rocky bottoms. I also grabbed a tiny USB-rechargeable lantern. It’s been raining a lot. If I get stuck in the tent, I have “Godel, Escher, Bach” to keep me busy – all strange loops, and recursion, self-referencing refrains that call to mind for me reincarnation or many worlds depending on your ideas about spacetime. Using digital light to process print information seems par for the course.</p>







<p>I’d hoped to be able to tour the Barnes Foundation today, but it was closed to the general public. In reading how Godel assigned symbols to numbers to generate a coded language that generated insights into the limitations of mathematical proofs, I started to think more about Steganography, secretly encoding objects with alternate meanings. It is a form of information exchange that can exist out in the open, but only able to be translated by those who know the coding. Stephers brought it to my attention a few years back. </p>



<p>The Barnes Foundation has an unusual, and highly politicized history. Albert Barnes, a Philadelphian, got his MD at the University of Pennsylvania, then trained as a corporate chemist in Heidelberg, Germany, and later made a fortune selling, <a href="https://hekint.org/2020/08/18/albert-c-barnes-md-the-physician-who-spun-silver-into-gold/">Argyrol</a>, silver nitrate drops used in infants eyes after delivery. </p>



<p>He used his fortune to acquire a vast, eclectic collection of Impressionist, Post-Impressionist, and Modern art. These pieces are displayed in methodical arrangements, or ensembles, that incorporate pieces of decorative arts and furniture as well as ritual objects from a range of world cultures. Barnes created sets, and the interplay of the objects in each set generates additional meaning, context, through juxtaposition. </p>



<p>Barnes focused on the application of scientific principles to art, and established education programs around the collection. His wife Laura managed an arboretum on the property, also focused on continuing adult education. They considered the estate in Lower Merion to be a laboratory. </p>



<p>Albert, who had grown up poor, was often at odds with Philadelphia’s social elite. When he died, management of the collection and its programs was entrusted to a board run by Lincoln University, a historically Black college in Chester County.  For decades there was rancor with the Barnes neighbors in Merion, and the elite wanted to break the trust, push out the Lincoln trustees and bring Barnes’s art lab, in a rather more neutered format to the Ben Franklin Parkway, which is where I’m now sitting killing time under the fancy blooming buckeyes until my car is ready. </p>



The “new” Barnes on the Ben Franklin Parkway







<p>Now I am factoring in artifacts and Godel’s numbering system that to me has digital ID overtones, as well as agents, civic gaming, tokens, signals, and computation within layers of meaning where some (maybe many) interconnected information fields are obscured or subject to the Pitt/Ober Athenian “knowledge management” protocols. </p>



<p>What is AR crypto “play to earn,” really? If I listen to my gut, I would say it is about massive parallel post-Moore’s law information processing through networked biophysics and social physics and dynamic game mechanics linked to the sensors and actuators of spatial computing.</p>







<p>Are we meant to be Godel Numbers, dancing, harmonizing, particles in a cosmic conversation only our subconscious can access?  </p>



<p>Maybe notes in a musical performance? Orchestral music? Jazz? Sacred? Profane? Remember, Tik Tok started out as ByteDance, and a Conductrr crisis simulation modelling system that promotes the use of xAPI to build fluid reality has been running in the background gor a decade or more. I was intrigued to read that Ada Lovelace imagined Babbage’s computing machine might be used to realize complex scientific forms of music. Was it music of the spheres, cymatics, manifestation? </p>















<p>If Galia of Bancor seeks to harness the power of mothers’ hearts through tokens, what does it mean that Joseph Lubin, founder of Consensys and a lead builder of smart contract worlds got his start in Princeton in robotics and automated music?   </p>











<p>Jamie Wheal’s book “Stealing Fire” has a whole chapter on the tech behind the electronic dance music scene as a catalyst for ekstasis.  Is the point to use token engineering combined with nano and frequency to network human embodied intelligence into a global composition so that we collectively unlock access to subconscious fields of information and serve as some kind of vast liquid crystal manifesting system that uses encoded cultural artifacts as a kind of creative language? These are all crazy possibilities I am mulling over. </p>



<p>I just can’t help but wonder about Barnes and Heidelberg and baby eyes and arranged artifacts and encoded (perhaps interdimensional?) communication and botany and arborization and many worlds and the Montecarlo method and what jokes this gritty, esoteric city is playing on me…</p>







<p>Two imposing sculptures flank the median of the Parkway, The Soldiers and Sailors Civil War Monument, erected by the city during World War I. I can’t help but think of the intergenerational polarity generated by the Civil War, still reverberating through our shared consciousness as the culture wars, now with memes, hashtags, social graphs, and digital stigmergy. When I read the statements about freeing slaves and freedom under a unified Constitution, one destiny, I picture a future with Nicole Shanahan’s equitable smart contract laws, logic melded culture that has been codified, standardized, and made accessible to a global outside-in robot that has no soul. </p>



“In Giving Freedom To The Slave, We Assure Freedom To The Free”



<p>I think of sovereign agents in a never-ending series of loosely programmed scenarios, degrees of  freedom set in advance, where AI life coaches log choices made on permanent ledgers, and assess our relative worth in the current fitness landscape. Not slaves, but “free” agents responding to a digital constitution reimagined as a dynamic, responsive gameboard, cells in the collective Athenian smart-city superorganism. </p>



“One Country, One Constitution, One Destiny”



<p>As I mull all of this over – my city speaking to me in steganography – you are an agent who is failing to advance the noetic biohybrid computer. Therefore you are a cancer to be shunned, excluded, expelled. That’s just how the program works. I see it, and my bags are packed. Rafael says the fluids are all topped off and my old dumb Subaru is ready to head South into unknown territory.   </p>



<p>I made some site visits over the last few days, left a few hearts behind – shocker, right? The first was under an ancient oak behind Jeffrey Yass’s Susquehanna International Group headquarters in Bala Cynwyd on the Main Line. I think the fact that it’s labelled “revolutionary” is significant.</p>















<p>I used pollen and fallen oak leaves with pine cones and dandelions – so cheerful and humble. In the center I placed a rose nicked from the parking lot of my Jungian analyst whom I’m sad to leave. Even though he didn’t follow a lot of what I said, he valued my authenticity and my journey, as odd as it is turning out to be. I told him the heart would be a tribute to entelechy, as represented by the acorn – the tiny spark of powerful potential that is our soul’s quest. I had to look really hard to find three tiny acorns, but I did and placed them on some mugwort (good for dreams). </p>







<p>I hugged the massive girth of the oak, a symbol of arborization, anima mundi, branching choices, montecarlo, and asked for guidance in what comes next – to be of service with the time I have left.  </p>











<p>The sculpture below is right out in front of the building. It is white metal and consists of three overlapping circles topped by linear waves. To me this connected to Hofstadter’s discussion of recursion, cannon, and fugues. Remember SIG was the esrly lead investor in Tik Tok, pendulum, time, entrainment. </p>















<p>Yesterday I visited the Kelpius cave, and to my surprise it seems like some Pythagoreans had gotten there first. When I arrived there were sizeable sticks, along with rocks and rubble, arranged in a large triangle. </p>







<p>Inside was a base and from it extended several smaller sticks that created a simple “tree” with three branches. There was a symbol with paired triangles, like the Star of David etched in the damp earth near the doorway. Scattered around seemed to be broken remnants of a popsicle stick project, which to me symbolized configurations of crystal lattice. </p>







<p>Upon that I placed my heart of purple Pawlonia blossoms, dandelions, fern, may apple, pine cones, and tulip poplar petals. Scattered around the edge were Star of Bethlehem flowers. </p>



























<p>When I finished I chatted with a white-haired gentleman, a birder named Paul (which factors into my cathedral visit) who’d been watching migrating warblers around the cave. He told me he had a friend who he used to walk with who had been sort of an informal caretaker of the cave. I pointed out the fading Nephele graffiti and showed him the heart and branched sticks, and then went into avianmagnetoreception as a study case for quantum biology and how that tied into US Navy funded anthropology  research into Micronesian open water navigation. He told me a bit about local garnets, and I shared some mica flakes I found. It was a gentle way to close my time in the Wissahickon. </p>















<p>So then on my drive to take my car to the mechanic, I stopped at a light on Broad Street at MARCONI Plaza and in the median was a woman in a sun hat digging dandelions! </p>











<p>Then heading home I walked through Love Park, noticing it was now sponsored by Bank of America. There were some guys with big cameras set up to take pictures of people taking pictures posing in front of the sculpture. I wondered if they were working on a documentary, so I tried to chat them up about gap junctions, group mind, the energy of the heart torus field, and Lev “Heart” being the name of Galia Benarzi’s first digital community currency – structured around an Israeli mothers’ babysitting co-op. They were not very interested. </p>











<p>The next person to not be interested was the gal staffing the open budget pop-up cargo container civic education junket sponsored in part by Mural Arts. I tried to explain web3 token voting linked to AI twins and social impact betting. Then a guy showed up with flyers about advice on home ownership and career services, and I had to point out that when Philadelphia’s City Council had anti-poverty hearings five years ago, the region’s job growth report said the average wage was going to be $15 an hour. You can’t buy a house in Philadelphia with that income. I pointed to the office buildings around us and said – those will be redone as affordable rental housing, only it will be like a dorm and your bedroom will have no windows, and you will pay your rent with UBI and data tied to sustainability and wellness behaviors. If you want sunlight the common area by the windows will be full of AI vision cameras and sensors like at WeWork (now Flow) and if you play the game well you can earn a small bit of equity in the ant computer. This will be set up by strange bedfellows partnerships between private equity (Blackstone/Ancestry.com DNA), community banks, high net individuals, and religious groups. </p>



<p>They barely registered what I was saying. In the end I told her to look up Cesar Hidslgo’s TED talk on radical participatory voting. They are training voters for the old game, just as they are about to be taken for a ride by the new web3 tokenomics game.   </p>











<p>And why is Mural Arts behind this? Think cultural artifacts, symbols, civic gaming. This is a useful p<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304422X18303747">aper </a>on social impact finance linked to public art. The city remade as a digital museum for collective manipulation and “creative placemaking.”</p>



<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304422X18303747">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304422X18303747</a>



<p>My final stop was at the Catholic Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul overlooking Logan Circle. I hadn’t actually been inside before, but yesterday was the day. I entered the foyer with plaques commemorating masses given by Pope Francis and Pope John Paul II, then I went inside. What struck me was all the different ways sacred light was communicated, the many references to paired keys (encryption), and the book and the sword (Paul) that evoked for me Philip Pullman’s subtle knife that can cut through dimensions. or perhaps information fields as represented by the good book. </p>































<p>There was a huge painting of the Magi under a beaming star of Bethlehem. I’d used Star of Bethlehem blossoms in my Kelpius heart. </p>















<p>The final synchronicity was the strange appearance of a new white ball cap with a Northeastern University Huskies logo on it. I’d been going back and forth the day before, texting with a friend about the oversize role it seemed the Boston university was playing in the AI, biotech, ed-tech transformation of Maine under the guidance of former Jackson Labs spokesperson David Roux.  And now here was a hat for that very school, the first thing I saw upon entering the sanctuary.</p>











<p>So my last day in the city of brotherly love is winding down. I read this passage on the subway today – how to step outside the system. </p>







<p>I don’t think it’s truly possible to exit, but for now I’m unplugging from Philly, a city that taught me much and broke my heart. With time I hope it will heal, and I can become a wise old crone. </p>

<p>Vor dem Hintergrund der Spielerinitiative <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/countries/germany">„Stop killing games“, die sich gegen das Lahmlegen von Computerspielen durch ihre Hersteller wendet,</a> hat der <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/EPRS_116648_124540-Final_answer_on_software_updates_-1.pdf">Wissenschaftliche Dienst des Europäischen Parlaments im Auftrag der Europaabgeordneten der Piratenpartei Dr. Patrick Breyer die einschlägigen EU-Gesetze untersucht und sieben potenziell relevante Regelungen aufgeführt.</a> Breyer sieht Lücken im Rechtsrahmen:</p>



<p>„Es fehlen klare EU-Verbraucherschutzregelungen gegen die branchenübliche Praxis, dass Spielehersteller beliebte Spiele gewinnbringend verkaufen, sich dabei aber die willkürliche, jederzeitige Unbrauchbarmachung vorbehalten und nicht einmal eine Rückerstattung des Kaufpreises anbieten. Es gibt zwar eine allgemeine EU-Richtlinie gegen ‚missbräuchliche Klauseln in Verbraucherverträgen‘, aber deren Auslegung muss langwierig von Gerichten entschieden werden. Es gibt außerdem eine EU-Richtlinie, derzufolge digitale Inhalte während der Vertragsdauer bereit gestellt werden müssen, aber gegen die kurzfristige Kündigung und Einstellung eines gerade erst gekauften Spiels schützt sie nicht. Die EU-Regeln werden der kulturellen Bedeutung von Games nicht gerecht, die gewachsene Gemeinschaften von Millionen von Spielern zusammen bringen können. Wir Piraten fordern, dass die EU Games als Kulturgut schützt, ein Lahmlegen nach Gutdünken verbietet und, wenn der Hersteller Games aufgibt, ein Weiterführen durch die Community ermöglicht.“</p>

 Introduction 
 
 I opened the meeting and introduced <a href="https://omnigres.com">Omnigres</a>’s <a href="https://yrashk.com">Yurii Rashkovskii</a>. 
 
 Presentation 
 
 
<p>Yurii: Today I’m going to be talking about universally buildable
extensions. This is going to be a shorter presentation, but the point of
it is to create some ideas, perhaps some takeaways, and actually provoke a
conversation during the call. It would be really amazing to explore what
others think, so without further ado…</p>
 
 
<p>I’m with Omnigres, where we’re building a lot of extensions. Often  they
push the envelope of what extensions are supposed to do. For example, one
of our first extensions is an HTTP server that embeds a web server inside
of Postgres. We had to do a lot of unconventional things. We have other
extensions uniquely positioned to work both on developer machines and
production machines — because we serve the the developers and devops
market.</p>
 
 
<p>The point of Omnigres is turning Postgres into an application runtime —
or an application server — so we really care how extensions get adopted.
When we think about application developers, they need to be able to use
extensions while they’re developing, not just in production or on some
remote server. They need extensions to work on their machine.</p>
 
 
<p>The thing is, not everybody is using Linux Other people use macOS and
Windows and we have to account for that. There are many interesting
problems associated with things like dependencies.</p>
 
 
<p>So there’s a very common approach used by those who who try to orchestrate
such setups and by some package managers: operating out of container. The
idea is that with a can create a stable environment where you bring all
the dependencies that your extension would need, and you don’t have to
deal with the physical reality of the host machine. Whether it’s a
developer machine, CI machine, production machine, you always have the
same environment. That’s definitely a very nice property.</p>
 
 
<p>However, there are some interesting concerns that we have to be aware when
we operate out of a container. One is specifically mapping resources. When
you have a container you have to map how many cores are going there,
memory, how do we map our volumes (especially on Docker Desktop), how we
connect networking, how we pass environment variables.</p>
 
 
<p>That means whenever you’re running your application — especially
locally, especially in development — you’re always interacting with that
environment and you have to set it up. This is particularly problematic
with Docker Desktop on macOS and Windows because these are not the same
machines. You’re operating out of a virtual machine machine instead of
your host machine, and obviously containers are Linux-specific, so it’s
always Linux.</p>
 
 
<p>What we found is that often times it really makes a lot of sense to test
extensions, especially those written in C, on multiple platforms. Because
in certain cases bugs, especially critical memory-related bugs, don’t show
up on one platform but show up on another. That’s a good way to catch
pretty severe bugs.</p>
 
 
<p>There are also other interesting, more rare concerns. For example, you
cannot access the host GPU through Docker Desktop on macOS or through
Colima. If you’re building something that could have use the host GPU that
would work on that machine it’s just not accessible. If you’re working
something ML-related, that can be an impediment</p>
 
 
<p>This also makes me wonder: what are other reasons why we’re using
containers. One reason that struck out very prominently was that Postgres
always has paths embedded during compile time. That makes it very
difficult to ship extensions universally across different installations,
different distributions. I wonder if that is one of the bigger reasons why
we want to ship Postgres as a Docker container: so that we always have the
same path regardless of where where it’s running.</p>
 
 
<p>Any questions so far about Docker containers? Also if there’s anybody who
is operating a Docker container setup — especially in their development
environment — if you have any thoughts, anything to share: what are the
primary reasons for you to use a Docker container in your development
environment?</p>
 
 
<p>Jeremy S in chat: When you say it’s important to test on multiple
platforms, do you mean in containers on multiple platforms, or
directly on them?</p>
 
 
<p>Jeremy S in chat: That is - I’m curious if you’ve found issues, for
example, with a container on Mac/windows that you wouldn’t have found
with just container on linux</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Daniele: Probably similarity with the production deployment environments.
That’s one. Being free from whatever is installed on your laptop, because
maybe I don’t feel like upgrading the system Python version and
potentially breaking the entire Ubuntu, whereas in a Docker container you
can have whatever version of Python, whatever version of NodeJS or
whatever other invasive type of service. I guess these are these are good
reasons. These were the motivation that brought me to start developing
directly in Docker instead of using the desktop.</p>
 
 
<p>Yurii: Especially when you go all the way to to production, do you find
container isolation useful to you?</p>
 
 
<p>Daniele: Yeah I would say so; I think the problem is more to break
isolation when you’re are developing. So just use your editor on your
desktop, reload the code, and have a direct feedback in the container. So
I guess you have to break one barrier or two to get there. At least from
the privilege points of having a Linux on desktop there is a smoother
path, because it’s not so radically different being in the container.
Maybe for Windows and macOS developers it would be a different experience</p>
 
 
<p>Yurii: Yeah, I actually wanted to drill down a little bit on this In my
experience, I build a lot on macOS where you have to break through the
isolation layers with the container itself and obviously the VM. I’ve
found there are often subtle problems that make the experience way less
straightforward.</p>
 
 
<p>One example I found it that, in certain cases, you’re trying to map a
certain port into the container and you already have something running [on
that port] on your host machine. Depending on how you map the port —
whether you specify or don’t specify the address to bind on — you might
not get Docker to complain that this port is actually overridden.</p>
 
 
<p>So it can be very frustrating to find the port, I’m trying to connect to
it but it’s not connecting to to the right port. There’s just very small
intricate details like this, and sometimes I’ve experienced problems like
files not perfectly synchronizing into the VM — although that has gotten
a little better in the past 2–3 years — but there there were definitely
some issues. That’s particularly important for the workflows that we’re
doing at Omnigres, where you’re running this entire system — not just
the database but your back end. To be able to connect to what’s running
inside of the container is paramount to the experience.</p>
 
 
<p>Daniele: Can I ask a question about the setup you describe? When you go
towards production, are those containers designed to be orchestrated by
Kubernetes? Or is there a different environments where you have your
Docker containers in a local network, I assume, so different Dockers
microservices talking to each other. Are you agnostic from what you run in
it, or do you run it on Kubernetes or on Docker Compose or some other form
of glue that you you set up yourself, or your company has set up?</p>
 
 Steven Miller in chat: … container on Mac/windows [versus linux] 
 Steven Miller in chat: Have seen with chip specific optimizations
like avx512 
 
 
 
<p>Yurii: Some of our users are using Docker Compose to run everything
together. However, I personally don’t use Docker containers. This is part
of the reason why the topic of this presentation is about universally
buildable extensions. I try to make sure that all the extensions are
easily compilable and easily distributable on any given supported
platform. But users do use Docker Compose, it’s quite common.</p>
 
 
<p>Does anyone else here have a preference for how to move Docker containers
into production or a CI environment?</p>
 
 
<p>Nobody?  I’ll move on then.</p>
 
 
<p>Steven Miller in chat: Since in docker will run under emulation, but
on linux will run with real hardware, so the environment has different
instruction set support even though the docker —platform config is the
same</p>
 
 
<p>Jeremy S in chat: That makes sense</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Yurii: I wanted to show just a little bit of a proof of concept tool that
we’ve been working on, on and off for the last year—</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): Yurii, there are a couple comments and questions
in chat, I don’t know if saw that</p>
 
 
<p>Yurii: I didn’t see that sorry.</p>
 
 
<p>Jeremy is saying, “when you say it’s important to test on
multiple platforms do you mean in containers on multiple platforms or
directly on them?” In that particular instance I meant on multiple
platforms, directly.</p>
 
 
<p>The other message from Jeremy was, “I’m curious if you found issues for
example with a container on Mac or Windows that you wouldn’t have found
with just container on Linux?” Yeah I did see some issues depending on the
type of memory-related bug. Depending on the system allocator, I was
either hitting a problem or not. I was not hitting it on Linux, I believe
and it was hidden macOS. I don’t remember the details right now,
unfortunately, but that difference was indicative of a bug.</p>
 
 
<p>Steven wrote, trying to connect this… “Have * seen chip-specific
optimizations for containers?” And, “Docker will run under emulation but
on Linux will run with real Hardware.” Yeah that’s an interesting one
about ax512. I suppose this relates to the commentary about  about GPU
support, but this is obviously the other part of supporting specific
hardware, chip-specific optimizations That’s an interesting thing to
learn; I was not aware of that! Thank you Steven.</p>
 
 
<p>Let’s move on. postgres.pm is a pro of concept that I was working on for
some time. The idea behind it was both ambitious but also kind of simple:
Can we try describing Postgres extensions in such a way that they will be
almost magically built on any supported platform?</p>
 
 
<p>The idea was to build an expert system of how to build things from a
higher level definition. Here’s an example for pgvector:</p>
  <code>:- package(vector(Version), imports([git_tagged_revision_package(Version)])).
git_repo("https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector").
:- end_package.
</code>  <p>It’s really tiny! There are only two important things there: the Git
tagged revision package and Git repo. There’s nothing else to describe the
package.</p>
 
 
<p>The way this works is by inferring as much information as possible from
what’s available. Because it’s specified as a Git-tagged revision package,
it knows that it can download the list of version-shaped revisions — the
versions — and it can checkout the code and do further inferences. It
infers metadata from <code>META.json</code> if it’s available, so it will know the
name of the package, the description, authors, license, and everything
else included there.</p>
 
 David G. Johnston in chat: PG itself has install-check to verify
that an installed instance is functioning. What are the
conventions/methods that extension authors are using so that a
deployed container can be tested at a low level of operation for the
installed extensions prior to releasing the image to production? 
 
 
 
<p>It automatically infers the build system. For example for C extensions, if
it sees that there’s a <code>Makefile</code> and C files, it infers that you need
<code>make</code> and a C compiler and it tries to find those on the system: it will
try to find <code>cc</code>, <code>gcc</code>, Clang —  basically all kinds of things.</p>
<p>*David Wheeler (he/him)() in chat: Feel free to raise hands with questions</p>
 
 
<p>Here’s a slightly more involved example for <code>pg_curl</code>. Ah, there was a
question from David Johnson. David says, “PG has install-check to verify
that installed instance is functioning. What are the conventions methods
that extension authors are using so the deployed container can be tested
at a low level of operation for the installed extension prior to releasing
the image to production?”</p>
 
 
<p>I guess the question is about general conventions for how extension
authors ensure that the extensions work, but I suppose maybe part of this
question is whether that’s also testable in a production environment.
David, are you talking about the development environment alone or both?</p>
 
 
<p>David G. Johnston: Basically, the pre-release to production. You go in
there in development and you cut up an extension and source and then you
build your image where you compile it — you compile PG, you compile it,
or you deploy packages. But now you have an image, but you’ve never
actually tested that image. I can run <code>installcheck</code> on an installed
instance of Postgres and know that it’s functioning, but it won’t test my
extension. So if I install PostGIS, how do I test that it has been
properly installed into my database prior to releasing that image into
production?</p>
 
 Tobias Bussmann in chat: shouldn’t have the extension a make
installcheck as well? 
 
 
 
<p>Yurii: To my knowledge there’s no absolutely universal method. Of course
the PGXS methods are the most standard ones — like <code>installcheck</code> — to
to run the tests. In our [Omnigres’s] case, we replaced <code>pg_regress</code> with
<code>pg_yregress</code>, another tool that we’ve developed. It allows for more
structural tests and tests that test certain things that <code>pg_regress</code>
cannot test because of the way it operates.</p>
 
 David Wheeler (he/him) in chat:
<a href="https://docs.omnigres.org/pg_yregress/intro/">https://docs.omnigres.org/pg_yregress/intro/</a> 
 
 
 
<p>I can share more about this later if that’s of interest to anybody. So we
basically always run <code>pg_yregress</code> on our extensions; it creates a new
instance of Postgres — unless told to use a pre-existing instance —
and it runs all the tests there as a client. It basically deploys the the
extension and runs the set of tests on it.</p>
 
 
<p>David G. Johnston: Okay.</p>
<p>Yurii: I guess you know it depends on how you ship it. For example, if you
look at the pgrx camp, they have their own tooling for that, as well. I’ve
also seen open-source extensions where they could be written in, say,
Rust, but still using <code>pg_regress</code> tests to test their behavior. That
would often depend on how their build system is integrated in those tests.
I guess the really short answer is there’s probably no absolutely
Universal method.</p>
 
 
<p>David thank you for pasting the link to <code>pg_yregress</code>. If there are ny
questions about it, feel free to ask me. Any other thoughts or questions
before I finish this slide? Alright will carry on then.</p>
  <code>:- package(pg_curl(Version), imports(git_explicit_revision_package(Version))).
:- inherit(requires/1).
git_repo("https://github.com/RekGRpth/pg_curl").
git_revisions([
        '502217c': '2.1.1',
        % ... older versions omitted for now ...
    ]).
requires(when(D := external_dependency(libcurl), version::match(D, '^7'))).
:- end_package.
</code>   
 
<p>The difference between this example and the previous one is that here it
specifies that there will be an explicit revision map because that project
does not happen to have version tags, so they have to be done manually.
You can see that in the Git revision specification. But what’s more
interesting about this is that it specifies what kind of dependency it
needs. In this particular instance it’s <code>libcurl</code>, and the version has to
match version 7 — any version 7.</p>
 
 
<p>These kinds of requirements, as well as compiler dependencies, <code>make</code>
dependencies, and others are always solved by pluggable satisfiers. They
look at what’s available depending on the platform — Linux, a particular
flavor of Linux, macOS, etc — and picks the right tools to see what’s
available. In the future there’s a plan to add features like building
these dependencies automatically, but right now it depends on the host
system, but in a multi-platform way.</p>
 
 David Wheeler (he/him) in chat: How does it detect that libcurl is
required? 
 
 
 
<p>The general idea behind this proof of concept is that we want to specify
high level requirements and not how exactly to satisfy them. If you
compare this to a Docker file, the Docker file generally tells you exactly
what to do step by step: let’s install this package and that
package, let copy files, etc. so it becomes a very specific set of
instructions.</p>
 
 Jeremy S in chat: And how does it handle something with different
names in different places? 
 
 
 
<p>There was a question: “how does it detect that <code>libcurl</code> is required?”
There there is this line at the bottom says “requires external dependency
<code>libcurl</code>, so that was the definition.”</p>
 
 
<p>The other question was “how does it handle something with different names
in different places?” I’m not sure I understand this question.</p>
 
 
<p>Jeremy S: I can be more spe specific. A dependency like <code>libc</code> is called
<code>libc</code> on Debian platforms and it’s called <code>glibc</code> on Enterprise Linux.
You talked about available satisfiers like Homebrew, Apt and package
config, but what if it has a different name in Homebrew than in Apt or
something like? Does it handle that or is that just something you haven’t
tackled yet?</p>
 
 
<p>Yurii: It doesn’t tackle this right now, but it’s part of the division
where it should go. For certain known libraries there’s an easy way to add
a mapping that will kick in for a distribution, and otherwise it will be a
satisfier for another one. They’re completely pluggable, small satisfiers
looking at all the predicates that describe the system underneath.</p>
 
 David G. Johnston in chat: How is the upcoming move to meson in core
influencing or impacting this? 
 
 
 
<p>Just for point of reference, this is built on top of Prolog, so it’s like
a knowledge base and rules for how to apply on this knowledge to
particular requirements.</p>
 
 
<p>Tobias Bussmann in chat: Prolog 👍</p>
 
 
<p>Shaun Thomas in chat: What if there are no satisfiers for the
install? If something isn’t in your distro’s repo, how do you know
where to find the dependency? And how is precedence handled? If two
satisfiers will fulfill a requirement, will the highest version win?</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Jeremy S: I remember Devrim talking about, if you read through the [RPM]
spec files, what find is all this spaghetti code with <code>#ifdefs</code> and  logic
branches and in his case is just dealing with differences between Redhat
and SUSE. If this is something that we manually put in, we kind of end up
in a similar position where it’s on us to create those mappings, it’s on
us to maintain those mappings over time — we kind of own it — versus
being able to automate some kind of automatic resolution. I don’t know if
there is a good automatic way to do it. David had found something that he
posted, which I looked at a little bit, but Devrim talked about how much
of maintenance overhead it becomes in the long run to constantly have to
maintain this which seemed less than ideal.</p>
 
 
<p>Yurii: It is less than ideal. For now, I do think that would have to be
manual, which is less than ideal. But it could be addressed at least on on
a case-by-case basis. Because we don’t really have thousands of extensions
yet — in the ecosystem maybe a thousand total — I think David Wheeler
would would know best from his observations, and I think he mentioned some
numbers in his presentation couple of weeks ago. But basically handling
this on on a case-by-case basis where we need this dependency and
apparently it’s a different one on a different platform, so let’s address
that. But if there can be a method that can at least get us to a certain
level of unambiguous resolution automatically or semi-automatically, that
would be really great.</p>
 
 Samay Sharma in chat: +1 on the meson question. 
 
 
 
<p>Jeremy S: I think there’s a few more questions in the chat.</p>
 
 
<p>Yurii: I’m just looking at them now. “how is the upcoming move to meson
and core influencing or impacting this?” I don’t think it’s influencing
this particular part in any way that I can think of right now. David, do
you have thoughts how it can? I would love to learn.</p>
 
 
<p>David G. Johnston: No, I literally just started up a new machine yesterday
and decided to build it from meson instead of <code>make</code> and the syntax of the
meson file seems similar to this. I just curious if there are any influences
there or if it’s just happenstance.</p>
 
 
<p>Yurii: Well from from what I can think right now, there’s just general
reliance on either implicitly found PG config or explicitly specified PG
config. That’s just how you discover Postgres itself. There’s no relation
to how Postgres itself was built. The packaging system does not handle say
building Postgres itself or providing it so it’s external to this proof of
concept.</p>
 
 
<p>David G. Johnston: That’s a good separation of concerns, but there’s also
the idea that, if core is doing something, we’re going to build extensions
against PostgresSQL, if we’re doing things similar to how core is doing
them, there’s less of a learning curve and less of everyone doing their
own thing and you have 500 different ways of doing testing.</p>
 
 
<p>Yurii: That’s a good point. That’s something definitely to reflect on.</p>
 
 
<p>I’ll move on to the next question from Sean. “What if there are no
satisfiers for the install? If something isn’t in your distro how do you
know where to find the dependency?” And “if two satisfiers will fulfill a
requirement, will the highest version win?” If there are no satisfiers
right now it will just say it’s not solvable. So we fail to do anything.
You would have to go and figure that out. It is a proof of concept, it’s
not meant to be absolutely feature complete but rather an exploration of
how we can describe the the packages and their requirements.</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): I assume the
idea is that, as you come upon these you would add more satisfiers.</p>
 
 
<p>Yurii: Right, you basically just learn. We learn about this particular
need in a particular extension and develop a satisfier for it. The same
applies to precedence: it’s a question of further evolution. Right now it
just finds whatever is available within the specified range.</p>
 
 
<p>If there are no more pressing questions I’ll move to the next slide. I was
just mentioning the problem of highly specific recipes versus high-level
requirements. Now I want to shift attention to another topic that has been
coming up in different conversations: whether to build and ship your
extension against minor versions of Postgres.</p>
 
 
<p>Different people have different stances in this, and even package managers
take different stands on it. Some say, just build against the latest major
version of Postgres and others say build extensions against every single
minor version. I wanted to research and see what the real answer should
be: should we build  against minor versions or not?</p>
 
 
<p>I’ve done a little bit of experimentation and my answer is “perhaps”, and
maybe even “test against different minor versions.” In my exploration of
version 16 (and also 15 bu Id didn’t include it) there there are multiple
changes between minor versions that can potentially be dangerous. One
great example is when you have a new field inserted in the middle of a
structure that is available through a header file. That definitely changes
the layout of the structure.</p>
  <code> typedef struct BTScanOpaqueData
 {
-    /* these fields are set by _bt_preprocess_keys(): */
+    /* all fields (except arrayStarted) are set by _bt_preprocess_keys(): */
     bool            qual_ok;                /* false if qual can never be satisfied */
+    bool            arrayStarted;     /* Started array keys, but have yet to "reach
+                                                               * past the end" of all arrays? */
     int                     numberOfKeys    /* number of preprocessed scan keys */
 }
</code>   
 
<p>In this particular case, for example, will not get number of keys if
you’re intending to. I think that change was from 16.0 to 16.1. If you
build against 16.0 and then try to run on 16.1, it might not be great.</p>
<p>The other concern that I found is there are new apis appearing in header
files between different versions. Some of them are implemented in header
files, either as macros or static and line functions. When you’re building
against that particular version, you’ll get the particular implementation
embedded.</p>
 
 
<p>Others are exports of symbols, like in this case, try index open
and contain mutable functions after planning, if you’re using any of this.
But this means that these symbols are not available on some minor versions
and they’re available later on, or vice versa: they may
theoretically disappear.</p>
 
 
<p>There are also changes in inline behavior. There was a change between 16.0
and 16.1 or 16.2 where an algorithm was changed. Instead of just <code>&gt; 0</code>
there’s now <code>&gt;= 0</code>, and that means that particular behavior will be
completely different between these implementations. This is important
because it’s coming from a header file, not a source file, so you’re
embedding this into your extension.</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him) in chat: That looks like a bug fix</p>
 
 
<p>Yeah it is a bug fix. But what I’m saying is, if you build your extension
against say 16.0m which did not have this bug fix, and then you deploy it
on 16.1, then you still have the bug because it’s coming from the header
file.</p>
 
 
<p>*David Wheeler (he/him): Presumably they suggest that you build from the
latest minor release and that’s Backward compatible to the earlier
releases.</p>
 
 
<p>Yurii: Right and that’s a good middle ground for this particular case. But
but of course sometimes when you do a minor upgrade you have to remember
that you have to rebuild your extensions against that minor version so you
can just easily transfer them yeah.</p>
 
 Jeremy S in chat: The struct change in a minor is very interesting 
 
 
 
<p>*David Wheeler (he/him)Jeremy points out that struct change is pretty
interesting.</p>
 
 
<p>Yurii: Yeah, it’s interesting because it’s super dangerous! Like if
somebody is expecting a different versioned structure, then  it can be
pretty nasty.</p>
 
 Shaun Thomas in chat: Yeah. It’s a huge no-no to insert components
into the middle of a struct. 
 
 
 
<p>Jeremy S: Is that common? I’m really surprised to see that in a minor
version. On the other hand, I don’t know that Postgres makes promises
about — some of this seems to come down to, when you’re coding in C and
you’re coding directly against structures in Postgres, that’s really
interesting. That’s — I’m surprised to see that still.</p>
 
 
<p>Steven Miller in chat: In the case of trunk, we would have built
against minor versions in the past then upgrade the minor version of
postgres without reinstalling the binary source of the extension, so
this is an issue</p>
 
 
<p>David G. Johnston in chat: Yeah, either that isn’t a public
structure and someone is violating visibility (in which case yes, you
should be tracking minor builds)</p>
 
 
<p>Shaun Thomas in chat: I’m extremely shocked that showed up in 16.2.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Yurii: Yeah, I didn’t expect that either, because that’s just a great way
to have absolutely undefined behavior. Like if somebody forgot to rebuild
their extension against a new minor, then this can be pretty terrible.</p>
 
 
<p>But my general answer to all of this unless you’re going really deep into
the guts of Postgres, unless you’re doing something very deep in terms
query planning, query execution, you’re probably okay? But who knows.</p>
 
 
<p>Jason Petersen in chat: yeah it feels like there’s no stated ABI
guarantee across minor updates</p>
 
 
<p>Jason Petersen in chat: other than “maybe we assume people know not
to do this"</p>
 
 
<p>David Christensen in chat: yeah ABI break in minor versions seems
nasty</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Jeremy S: But it’s not just remembering to rebuild your extension. Let’s
let’s suppose somebody is just downloading their extensions from the PGDG
repo, because there’s a bunch of them there. They’re not compiling
anything! They’re they’re downloading an RPM and the extension might be in
a different RPM from Postgres and the extension RPMs — I don’t know that
there have been any cases with any of the extensions in PGDG, so far,
where a particular extension RPM had to have compatibility information at
the level of minors.</p>
 
 
<p>Shaun Thomas in chat: There was actually a huge uproar about this a
couple year ago because they broke the replication ABI by doing this.</p>
 
 
<p>David G. Johnston in chat: I see many discussions about ABI
stability on -hackers so it is a goal.</p>
 
 
<p>Steven Miller in chat: PGDG is the same binaries for each minor
version because the postgres package is only major version, right?</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Yurii: Yeah, that’s definitely a concern, especially when it comes to the
scenario when you rebuild your extensions but just get pre-built packages.
It’s starting to leak out of the scope of this presentation, but I thought
it was a very interesting topic to bring to everybody’s attention.</p>
 
 
<p>Jason Petersen in chat: “it’s discussed on hackers” isn’t quite the
same as “there’s a COMPATIBILITY file in the repo that states a
guarantee”</p>
 
 
<p>Jason Petersen in chat: (sorry)</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>My last item. Going back to how we ship extensions and why do we need
complex build systems and packaging. Oftentimes you want your extensions
to depend on some library, say OpenSSL or SQLite or whatever, and the
default is to bring the shared dependency that would come from different
packages on different systems.</p>
 
 
<p>What we have found at Omnigres is that it is increasingly simpler to
either statically link with your dependencies — and pay the price of
larger libraries — but then you have no questions about where it comes
from — what what package, which version – you know exactly what which
version it is and how it’s getting built. But of course you also have a
problem where, if you want to change the version of the dependency it’s
harder because it’s statically linked. The question is whether you should
be doing that or not, depending on the authors of the extension and their
promises for compatibility with particular versions of their dependencies.
This one is kind of naive and simple, as in just use static. Sometimes
it’s not possible or very difficult to do so, some some libraries don’t
have build systems amenable to static library production.</p>
 
 
<p>What we found that works pretty nicely is using <code>rpath</code> in your dynamic
libraries. You can use special variables — <code>$ORIGIN</code> or <code>@loader_path</code>
on Linux or macOS, respectively, to specify that your dependency is
literally in the same folder or directory where your extension is. So you
can ship your extension with the dependencies alongside, and it will not
try to load them immediately from your system but from the same directory.
We find this pretty pretty useful.</p>
 
 
<p>That’s pretty much it. Just to recap I talked about the multi-platform
experience, the pros and cons of containers, inferencing how you build and
how you can build extensions with dependencies, static and <code>rpath</code>
dependencies, and the problems with PG minor version differences. If
anybody has thoughts, questions, or comments I think that would be a
great. Thank you.</p>
 
 
 Discussion 
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): Thank you, Yurii, already some good discussion.
What else do you all have?</p>
 
 
<p>David G. Johnston: PG doesn’t use semantic versioning. They we have a
major version and a minor version. The minor versions are new releases,
they do change behaviors. There are goals from the hackers to not break
things to the extent possible. But they don’t guarantee that this will not
change between dot-three and dot-four. When you’re releasing once a year
that’s not practical if things are broken, you can’t wait nine months to
fix something. Some things you need to fix them in the next update and
back-patch.</p>
 
 
<p>Steven Miller in chat: Thank you, this is very useful info</p>
 
 
<p>Jeremy S in chat: Dependency management is hard 🙂 it’s been a topic
here for awhile</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>David G. Johnston: So we don’t have a compatibility file, but we do have
goals and if they get broken there’s either a reason for it or someone
just missed it. From an extension standpoint, if you want to be absolutely
safe but absolutely cost intensive, you want to update every minor
release: compile, test, etc. Depending on what your extension is, you can
trade off some of that risk for cost savings. That’s just going to be a
personal call. The systems that we build should make it easy enough to do
releases every “dot” and back-patching. Then the real cost is do you spend
the time testing and coding against it to make sure that the stuff works.
So our tool should assume releasing extensions on every minor release, not
every major release, because that’s the ideal.</p>
 
 Shaun Thomas in chat: It’s good we’re doing all of this though. It
would suck to do so much work and just become another pip spaghetti. 
 
 
 
<p>Yurii: That’s exactly what I wanted to bring to everybody’s attention,
because there’s still a lot of conversations about this and there was not
enough clarity. So that helps a lot.</p>
 
 
<p>Jeremy S: Did you say release or did you say build with every Miner?
I think I would use the word “build”.</p>
 
 
<p>David G. Johnston: Every minor release, the ones that go out to the
public. I mean every commit you could update your extension if you wanted.
but really the ones that matter are the ones that go public. So, 16.3 or
16.4 comes out, automation would ideally would build your extension
against it run your test and see if anything broke. And then deploy the
new [???] of your extension against version 16.3. Plus that would be your
your release.</p>
 
 
<p>Jeremy S: I think there are two things there: There’s rebuilding it —
because you can rebuild the same version of the extension and that would
pick up if they they added a field in the middle of a struct which is what
happened between 16.0 and 16.1, rebuild the same version. Versus: the
extension author … what would they be doing? If they they could tag a
new version but they’re not actually changing any code I don’t think it is
a new release of the extension, because you’re not even changing anything
in the extension, you’re just running a new build. It’s just a rebuild.</p>
 
 David Wheeler (he/him) in chat: It’d be a new binary release of the
same version. In RPM it goes from v1.0.1-1 to v1.0.1-2 
 
<p>It reminds me of what Alvaro did in his his OCI blog post, where he said
you really have to … Many of us don’t understand how tightly coupled the
extensions need to be to the database. And these C extensions that we’re
we’re building have risks when we separate them don’t just build
everything together.</p>
 
 
<p>David G. Johnston: The change there would be metadata. Version four of my
extension, I know it works on 16.0 to 16.1. 16.2 broke it, so that’s where
it ends and my version 4.1 is known to work on 16.2.</p>
 
 
<p>Jeremy S: But there is no difference between version 4 and version 4.1.
There’s a difference in the build artifact that your build farm spit out,
but there’s no difference in the extension, right?</p>
 
 
<p>Keith Fiske in chat: Still confusing if you don’t bump the release
version even with only a library change</p>
 
 
<p>Keith Fiske in chat: How are people supposed to know what library
version is running?</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>David G. Johnston: Right. If the extension still works, then` your
metadata would just say, “not only do I work through version 16.2, I now
work through 16.3.</p>
 
 
<p>Jeremy S: But it goes back to the question: is the version referring to a
build artifact, or is the version referring to a version of the code? I
typically think of versions as a user of something: a version is the
thing. It would be the code of the extension. Now we’re getting all meta;
I guess there are arguments to be made both ways on that.</p>
 
 
<p>Jason Petersen in chat: (it’s system-specific)</p>
 
 
<p>Jason Petersen in chat: no one talks in full version numbers, look
at an actual debian apt-cache output</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): Other questions? Anybody familiar with the <code>rpath</code>
stuff? That seems pretty interesting to me as a potential solution for
bundling all the parts of an extension in a single directory — as
opposed to what we have now, where it’s scattered around four different
directories.</p>
 
 
<p>Jason Petersen: I’ve played around with this. I think I was trying to do
fault injection, but it was some dynamically loaded library at a different
point on the <code>rpath</code>. I’m kind of familiar with the
mechanics of it.</p>
<p>I just wanted to ask: In a bigger picture, this talks about building
extensions that sort of work everywhere. But the problems being solved are
just the duplication across the spec files, the Debian files, etc. You
still have to build a different artifact for even the same extension on
the same version of Postgres on two different versions of Ubuntu, Right?
Am I missing something? It is not an extension that runs everywhere.</p>
 
 
<p>Yurii: No, you still have to build against the set of attributes that
constitute your target, whether that’s architecture, operating system,
flavor. It’s not yet something you can build and just have one binary. I
would love to have that, actually! I’ve been pondering a lot about this.
There’s an interesting project, not really related to plugins, but if
you’ve seen A.P.E. and Cosmopolitan libc, they do portable executables.
It’s a very interesting hack that allows you to run binaries on any
operating system.</p>
 
 
<p>Jason Petersen: I expected that to be kind of “pie in the
sky.”</p>
 
 
<p>Yurii: It’s more of a work of art.</p>
 
 
<p>Jason Petersen: Do you know of other prior art for the <code>rpath</code>?  Someone
on Mastodon the other day was talking about Ruby — I can’t remember the
library, maybe it was ssh — and they were asking, “Do I still have to
install this dynamic library?” And they said, “No, we vendor that now;
whenever you install this it gets installed within the Ruby structure.”
I’m not sure what they’re doing; maybe it’s just a static linking. But I
was curious if you were aware of any prior art or other packaging systems
where system manages its own dynamic libraries, and use <code>rpath</code> to
override the loading of them so we don’t use the system ones and don’t
have to conflict with them. Because I think that’s a really good idea! I
just was wondering if there’s any sort of prior art.</p>
 
 
<p>Daniele: There is an example: Python Wheels binaries us <code>rpath</code>. A wheel
is a ZIP file with the C extension and all the depending libraries the
with the path modified so that they can refer to each other in the the
environment where they’re bundled. There is a tool chain to obtain this
packaging — this vendoring — of the system libraries. There are three,
actually: one for Unix, one for macOS, one for Windows. But they all more
or less achieve the same goal of having libraries where they can find each
other in the same directory or in a known directory. So you could take a
look at the wheel specification for Python and the implementation.
That could be a guideline.</p>
 
 
<p>Jason Petersen: Cool.</p>
 
 
<p>Yurii: That’s an excellent reference, thank you.</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): More questions?</p>
 
 
<p>Jeremy S: Yeah, I have one more. Yurii, the build inferencing was really
interesting. A couple things stood out to me. One that you mentioned was
that you look for The <code>META.json</code> file. That’s kind of neat, just that
it’s acknowledged a useful thing; and a lot of extensions have it and we
want to make use of it. I think everybody knows part of the background of
this whole series of meetings is — one of the things we’re asking is,
how can we improve what’s the next generation of <code>META.json</code> to make all
of this better? Maybe I missed this, but what was your high-level takeaway
from that whole experience of trying to infer the stuff that wasn’t there,
or infer enough information to build something if there isn’t a
<code>META.json</code> at all? Do you feel like it worked, that it was successful?
That it was an interesting experiment but not really viable long term? How
many different extensions did you try and did it work for? Once you put it
together, were you ever able to point it at a brand new extension you’d
never seen before and actually have it work? Or was it still where you’d
try a new extension and have to add a little bit of extra logic to handle
that new extension? What’s your takeaway from that experience?</p>
 
 
<p>Yurii: The building part is largely unrelated to <code>META.json</code>, that was
just primarily the metadata itself. I haven’t used in a lot of extensions
because I was looking for different cases — extensions that exhibit
slightly different patterns — not a whole ton of them yet. I would say
that, so far, this is more of a case-by-case scenario to see for a
particular type of or shape of extension what we need to do. But
generally, what I found so far that it works pretty nicely for C
extensions: it just picks up where all the stuff is, downloads all the
necessary versions, allows to discover the new versions — for example
you don’t need to update the specification for a package if you have a new
release, it will just automatically pick that up rom the list of tags.
These these were the current findings. I think overall the direction is
promising, just need to continue adjusting the results and see how much
further it can be taken and how much more benefit it can bring.</p>
 
 
<p>Jeremy S: Thank you.</p>
 
 
<p>Yurii: Any other comments or thoughts?</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): Any more questions for Yurii?</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): I think this is a an interesting space for some
research between Devrim’s presentation talking about how much effort it is
to manually maintain all the extensions in the Yum repository. I’ve been
doing some experiments trying to build everything from PGXN, and the
success rate is much lower than I’d like. I think there are some
interesting challenges to automatically figuring out how things work
versus convincing authors to specify in advance.</p>
 
 
<p>Jeremy S: Yep. Or taking on that maintenance. Kind of like what a spec
file maintainer or a Debian package maintainer is doing.</p>
 
 
<p>Yurii: Yeah, precisely.</p>
 
 
 Wrap Up 
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): Thanks, Yurii, for that. I wanted to remind
everyone that we have our final Mini-Summit before PGConf on May 15th.
That’s two weeks from today at noon Eastern or 4 pm UTC. We’re going to
talk about organizing the topics for the Summit itself. I posted a long
list of stuff that I’ve extracted from my own brain and lots more topics
that I’ve learned in these presentations in the Slack. Please join the
<a href="https://pgtreats.info/slack-invite" title="Join the Postgres Slack">community Slack</a> to participate.</p>
<p>The idea is to winnow down the list to a reasonable size. We already are
full with about 45 attendees, and we we can maybe have a few more with
standing room and some hallway track stuff. We’ll figure that out, but
it’s a pretty good size, so I think we’ll be able to take on a good six or
maybe eight topics. I’m going to go over them all and we’ll talk about
them and try to make some decisions in advance, so when we get there we
don’t have to spend the first hour figuring out what we want to, we can
just dive in.</p>
<p>And that’s it. Thank you everybody for coming, I really appreciate. We’ll
see you next time</p>
 
 
<p>Tobias Bussmann in chat: Thanks for the insights and discussion!</p>
 
 
<p>Jeremy S: Thank you!</p>

<p>So, just how do you win that first, coveted CTO, VP of Engineering, Head of Engineering, or Director of Engineering role? I know several professionals who have achieved such promotions internally, and a couple who were successful external candidates for their first CTO role.</p><p>These jobs are usually classed as executive roles, and author and CTO, <a href="https://lethain.com/">Will Larson</a>, has just published a handy book about these upper echelons. Before this latest title, he wrote a book on engineering management (<a href="https://lethain.com/elegant-puzzle/">An Elegant Puzzle</a>,) and one on staff+ engineering (<a href="https://staffeng.com/book">Staff Engineer</a>). Side note; we almost overlapped at Uber, with him departing the San Francisco office just as I joined the company in Amsterdam. We met in-person last year when I was in SF.</p><p>I picked up this new book, <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-engineering-executives/9781098149475/">The Engineering Executive’s Primer</a>, and can report that I’m thoroughly impressed. It’s honest in how it covers topics like navigating tricky power dynamics with CEOs, surviving “peer panic,” dealing with competition within leadership teams, and in its overall breadth and depth. There’s the usual topics: onboarding, hiring, engineering processes, performance processes, compensation, etc, and the book also goes deep into how to navigate mergers and acquisitions, cultural surveys, and how to onboard peer executives.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc1d25fe-ab5a-47d3-8e3e-e3cd1f1003c6_1600x1200.jpeg">    </a>My copy of <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-engineering-executives/9781098149475/">The Engineering Executive’s Primer</a> <p>I reached out to Will to ask if he’d be open to publishing a chapter from the new book in this newsletter, and he generously agreed. In today’s issue, we cover two topics:</p>  <p>The book’s and Will’s backgrounds. How did the idea of the book come about, how long did it take to write, and what is Will’s advice for software engineers aiming to be engineering executives.</p>  <p>Chapter 1. The opening chapter is titled “Getting the Job.” It’s a thorough summary of how to get that first engineering executive position; more so than I’ve read elsewhere. An excerpt from <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-engineering-executives/9781098149475/">the book</a>.</p>  <p>As usual with all my recommendations, I am not paid to recommend this book, and none of the links are affiliate ones. See my <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/ethics-statement/">ethics statement</a> for more detail.</p> 1. The book’s and Will’s backgrounds <p>Before we jump into the chapter, Will answered a few questions:</p><p>How did you get your first engineering executive job?</p><p>‘In late 2019, I was getting close to four years at Stripe, and understood the problems I was working on a bit too well. I started thinking about how to get my hands on a new set of problems. In particular, I was interested in finding ones to bring me back into product engineering, rather than continuing along the infrastructure engineering path, which I got on to somewhat accidentally at Uber.</p><p>‘Most inbound interest I received was for roles similar to the one I was in. So I asked some recently-hired executives how they’d found their jobs. Most mentioned working with executive recruiters, and I asked for referrals. This led me to Sam, the executive recruiter who helped find my CTO role at Calm, which I accepted following deep discussions with 3-4 other companies.’</p><p>What made you decide to write this book on executive roles, and can you discuss your choice to be so candid about the behind-the-scenes reality?</p><p>‘This is my third book, and I learned a lot from writing ‘An Elegant Puzzle’ and ‘Staff Engineer.’ There’s a curse in authorship, where I see so many things I could have done better in writing those books! Still, writing two intentionally different books helped me understand what I want to accomplish with my writing.</p><p>‘My goal when writing is to create something both useful and unique. Being useful is the only good reason to write a professional book, while being unique is the only way to create something durable that resonates with readers over time, and doesn’t fade away after a year or two.</p><p>‘When I first became an executive, I learned a lot by making mistakes. I wanted to scrutinize those errors, figure out frameworks that would’ve helped me avoid them, and collate these insights in a book to help others entering that role. Helping others avoid my mistakes is my best tool for advancing the technology industry, which is the professional goal I’m trying to channel my energy toward.’</p><p>How did you write the book, and how long did it take? I guess you started taking notes a long time ago, with so many observations across 24 chapters and more than 300 pages.</p><p>‘I have two concurrent writing processes:</p>  <p>I write down things I learn, as I learn them. This is the closest I have to a separate note-taking process. For example, I wrote the blog posts <a href="https://lethain.com/hard-to-work-with/">Hard to work with</a> and <a href="https://lethain.com/profit-and-loss-statement/">Reading a Profit &amp; Loss statement</a> in 2022 as standalone pieces, and updated versions of each show up in The Engineering Executive’s Primer.&nbsp;</p>  <p>I write based upon an outline of topics for a book. The chapter, <a href="https://lethain.com/measuring-engineering-organizations/">Measuring an engineering organization</a>, is a good example, and was the first piece I wrote explicitly with the new book in mind.</p>  <p>‘Writing this book took about 14 months. I started working on the outline in late 2022, and iterated on it three or four times, before it stabilized roughly into these chapters. I wrote about two-thirds of chapters before I started talking with the publisher, O’Reilly, about whether they’d be interested in it.&nbsp;</p><p>‘After signing the contract, I reworked the topics a bit with my editor, Virginia Wilson, completed the remaining chapters, and revised individual chapters several times based on feedback from her and reviewers. Writing books really does get easier the more you do it, and this book was relatively peaceful compared to my first two.’</p><p>You’ve been a software engineer, and are now a CTO. What are the biggest differences between these roles?&nbsp;</p><p>‘A friend recently emailed me asking if it’s possible to have friends at work as an executive, because he was finding that harder and harder, the more senior he’d gotten. In general, I’ve found it’s complex to have work friends as an executive, and that it only works when both individuals take the long view on outcomes. I miss my earlier roles where these things were less fraught.</p><p>‘Conversely, I’m really motivated by being able to engage with problems blocking forward progress, and being in an effective executive team is a job characterized by exclusively dealing with that kind of problem. For me, engaging with problems is the most energizing part of being an executive. At the same time, in my earlier work as an engineer I often found myself stymied by organizational constraints. To be fair, I was also a lot less effective at navigating organizational constraints back then.’</p><p>What’s your advice for software engineers ambitious to be a Head of Engineering, VP of Engineering, or CTO?</p><p>‘Spend more time understanding why people’s perspectives are “right,” rather than why they’re “wrong.” I think of this as extracting the core of what people say.&nbsp;</p><p>‘Being able to learn from those who don’t communicate clearly is a super power. Many who are theoretically good communicators – maybe the executives you work with – are too busy to always communicate clearly, and getting good at understanding them despite messy formatting is invaluable.</p><p>‘Spend less time on pursuits you don’t find energizing. For example, I’ve seen so many people try to become “content creators” to further their career, despite having no interest in creating content. The vast majority of successful executives don’t write stuff online and don’t speak at conferences. Do so if it’s energizing for you, but if it isn’t, find something that is!’</p><p>Thanks Will for sharing your thoughts! With that, we dive into Chapter 1 of the book.</p> 2. Getting an Engineering Executive Job <p>The below excerpt is from <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-engineering-executives/9781098149475/">The Engineering Executive's Primer</a>, by Will Larson. Copyright © 2024 Will Larson. Published by O'Reilly Media, Inc. Used with permission.</p><p>At Digg, I ended up running Engineering, but I certainly wasn’t hired to do so. It wasn’t until a decade later, when I joined Calm, that a company deliberately hired me into my first executive role. If you start researching executive career paths, you’ll find folks who nominally became Engineering executives at 21 when they found a company, and others who were more than 30 years into their career before taking an Engineering executive role.</p><p>As these anecdotes suggest, there is no “one way” to get an Engineering executive job. However, the more stories you hear about folks assuming executive roles, the more they start to sound pretty similar. I’ve condensed the many stories I’ve heard, along with my own experiences, into a repeatable process that prospective candidates typically follow.</p><p>This chapter will cover:</p>  <p>deciding whether to pursue an executive role</p>  <p>why each executive job search is unique, and how that will shape your process</p>  <p>finding executive roles externally and internally</p>  <p>navigating the often chaotic executive interview process after you’ve gotten comfortable interviewing in well-designed middle management interview processes</p>  <p>negotiating an executive contract, particularly the terms that rarely come up in the non-executive contracts you may have negotiated prior</p>  <p>deciding whether to accept an executive offer once you have it</p>  <p>If you’re kicking off the search for your first executive role, reading through this chapter will provide a clear roadmap through the process.</p> Why Pursue an Executive Role? <p>If you’re spinning up your first executive role search, you should have a clear answer to a question you’ll get a number of times, “Why are you looking for an executive role?” It’s important to answer this for yourself, as it will be a valuable guide throughout your search. If you’re not sure what the answer is, spend time thinking this through until you have a clear answer (maybe in the context of a <a href="https://lethain.com/career-checkup/">career checkup</a>).</p><p>There’s no right answer, but here are some examples from real people:</p>  <p>“I’m heavily motivated by learning. I’ve directly reported into an Engineering executive for my past two roles, and I’m looking to step into the role myself.”</p>  <p>“I’ve enjoyed working in a fast-growing company, but I also miss the direct ownership and pace of working at a small company. I’m excited to combine my previous startup experience with my recent experience at scale as an Engineering executive.”</p>  <p>The rationale doesn’t need to be particularly compelling, just something positive that expresses your excitement and qualification for the role. Don’t get discouraged if your statement isn’t profound—there are very few profound ways to say that it’s the next logical step in your career. Once you’ve written your rationale down, review it with a few peers or mentors who have already been in executive roles. Incorporate their feedback, and you’re done. (If you don’t have peers or mentors in executive roles, do some cold outreach to executives at companies you’ve worked at with your rationale and see if they’ll weigh in.)</p><p>The other side of this is that interviewers are also very curious about your reason for pursuing an executive role, but not necessarily for the reason you’d expect. Rather than looking for your unique story (although, yes, they’ll certainly love a memorable, unique story), they’re trying to filter out candidates with red flags: ego, jealousy, excessive status-orientation, and ambivalence.</p> One of One <p>Limited-release luxury items like fancy cars sometimes label each item with their specific production number, along with the size of the overall run. For example, you might get the fifth car in a run of 20 cars overall. The most exclusive possible production run is “one of one.” That item is truly bespoke, custom, and one of a kind.</p><p>All executive roles and processes are “one of one.”</p><p>For non-executive roles, good interviewing processes are systematized, consistent, and structured. Sometimes the interview processes for executive roles are well-structured, but more often they aren’t. If you approach these bespoke processes like your previous experiences interviewing, your instincts may mislead you through the process.</p><p>The most important thing to remember when searching for an executive role is that while there are guidelines, stories, and even statistics, there are no rules when it comes to finding executive jobs. There is a selection bias in executive hiring for confidence, which makes it relatively easy to find an executive who will tell you with complete confidence how things work but be a bit wary.</p><p>It’s not just the hiring process that is not standardized; the Engineering executive roles themselves vary greatly as well. Sometimes they’ll include managing Product Management, and sometimes they’ll exclude managing some parts of Engineering. Working with technology-oriented founders, you may provide more organizational support than technical guidance, whereas working in an older business may mean there are few other executives with a technology background. “One of one” means that anything is possible, in both the best and worst possible sense.</p> Finding Internal Executive Roles <p>Relatively few folks find their first executive job through an internal promotion. These are rare for a couple reasons. The first is that each company only has one Engineering executive, and that role is usually already filled. The second is that companies seeking a new Engineering executive generally need someone with a significantly different set of skills than the team they already have in place.</p><p>Even in cases where folks do take on an executive role at their current company, they often struggle to succeed. Their challenges mirror those of <a href="https://lethain.com/tech-lead-managers/">taking on tech lead manager roles</a>, where they are stuck learning how to do their new job in addition to performing their previous role. They are often also dealing with other internal candidates who were previously their peers and who may feel slighted by not getting the role themselves. This makes their new job even more challenging, and can lead to departures that hollow out the organization’s key leaders at a particularly challenging time.</p><p>That’s not to say that you should avoid or decline an internal promotion into an executive engineering role; just that you should go into it with your eyes open. In many ways, it’s harder to transition internally than externally. Because of that, even if an internal transition into an executive role goes poorly for you, don’t assume that means you wouldn’t do well as a newly hired executive at another company.</p> Finding External Executive Roles <p>Most executive roles are never posted on the company’s jobs page. So before discussing how you should approach your executive job search, let’s dig into how companies usually find candidates for their executive roles. Let’s imagine that my defunct company <a href="https://lethain.com/monocle-studios/">Monocle Studios</a> had been a wild success and we wanted to hire our first CTO.</p><p>How would we find candidates? Something along the lines of:</p>  <p>Consider any internal candidates for the role.</p>  <p>Reach out to the best folks in my existing network, seeing if any are interested in interviewing for the role.</p>  <p>Ask our internal executive recruiter to source candidates. (I’d skip this step if we didn’t have any executive recruiters internally, as generally there’s a different network and approach to running an executive search than a non-executive search; executive candidates also tend to ask different questions than non-executive candidates, which makes hiring them with non-executive recruiters even messier.)</p>  <p>Reach out to our existing investors for their help, relying on both their networks and their firms’ recruiting teams.</p>  <p>Hire an executive recruiting firm to take over the search.</p>  <p>Certainly not every company does every job search this way, but it does seem to be the consistent norm. This structure exposes why it’s difficult to answer the question, “How do I find my first executive role?” The quick answer is to connect with an executive recruiter—ideally one that peers have worked with before—but that approach comes with some implications on the sort of roles you’ll get exposed to. Typically, these will be roles that have been challenging to fill for some reason.</p><p>It’s important to note that the most desirable roles, and roles being hired by a well-networked and well-respected CEO, will never reach an executive recruiting firm. If you try to enter your search without an established network and rely solely on executive recruiters to find roles, you are almost certain to be selecting from second-tier opportunities.</p><p>This is, by the way, absolutely not a recommendation against using executive recruiters. Executive recruiting firms can be fantastic. A good executive recruiter will coach you through the process much more diligently than the typical company or investor’s in-house recruiter. I found my first executive role through an executive recruiter, as did the majority of my peers. (Note that the executive recruiters of tomorrow are your internal recruiting colleagues of today, so learning to partner effectively with Recruiting will pay dividends in both your current hiring and your long-term career options.) Similarly, it’s not true that all founder-led searches are for desirable jobs—almost all executive roles start as founder-led searches before working their way through the pipeline.</p><p>​​Looking at the pipeline, there are many ways to increase your odds of getting executive opportunities at each step. The basics still matter: Maintain an <a href="https://lethain.com/executive-linkedin-profile/">updated LinkedIn profile</a>, and respond politely to recruiters who do reach out. Both have a surprising way of creating job search serendipity, and ensuring your network is aware that you’re looking. If you don’t personally know many recruiters at investors or executive recruiters, your network can be particularly helpful for making those introductions.</p><p>There are also a small number of companies that do post executive roles publicly, and there’s certainly no harm in looking through those as well. The one challenge is that you’ll have to figure out whether it’s posted publicly because the company is very principled about searching for talent outside their personal networks (often a good sign), or if the role has already passed unsuccessfully through the entire funnel described above (often not a good sign). Most companies with strong principles like to talk about them a lot, and you should be able to find public evidence to support their posting coming from a principled belief. If you can’t, then it’s likely desperation.</p><p>Finally, if you’re laying the groundwork for an executive search a few years down the road, there’s quite a bit you can do to prepare. You can join a large or high-growth company to expand your network (more on this in Chapter 12), work in a role where you get exposure to the company’s investors, create more visibility of your work (more on this in Chapter 12 and Chapter 15) to make it more likely for founders to reach out to you, or get more relevant experience growing and operating an Engineering organization.</p> Interview Process <p>The interview process for executive roles is always a bit chaotic. The most surprising thing for most candidates is that the process often feels less focused or effective than their other recent interviews. This is because your hiring manager as a director of Engineering is usually an experienced engineering leader, but your hiring manager as an Engineering executive is usually someone with no engineering experience at all. In the first case, you’re being interviewed by someone who understands your job quite well, and in the second, the interviewer usually has never worked in the role.</p><p>There are, inevitably, exceptions! Sometimes your interviewer was an Engineering executive at an earlier point in their career, but that usually isn’t the case. A relatively common scenario in startups is when a technical founder interviews you for the role, potentially with them staying as the CTO and you taking on the VPE title. But, even then, it’s worth noting that the title is a bit of a smokescreen, and they likely have limited experience as an Engineering executive.</p><p>Consequently, Engineering executive interviews depend more heavily on perceived fit, prestige, the size of the teams you’ve previously managed, being personable, and navigating the specific, concrete concerns of would-be direct reports and peers. This makes the “little things” particularly important in executive interviews: send quick and polite follow-ups, use something like the <a href="https://lethain.com/star-method/">STAR method</a> to keep your answers concise and organized, prepare questions that show you’re strengthening your mental model of how the company works, and generally show energy and excitement.</p><p>The general interview process that I’ve seen for executive roles is as follows:</p>  <p>Call with a recruiter to validate you meet the minimum requirements, are a decent communicator, and won’t embarrass them if you talk to the CEO. Recruiters are heavily scrutinized on the quality of candidates they bring forward and will go out of their way to help you show up well. This is also a good opportunity for you to understand whether there are obvious issues that might make this a bad role for you, such as wrong job location, wrong travel expectations, and so forth.</p>  <p>Call with the CEO or another executive to assess interest in the role, and very high-level potential fit for the role. You’ll be evaluated primarily on your background, your preparation for the discussion, the quality of your communication, and perceived excitement for the company.</p>  <p>Series of discussions with the CEO or founder, where you dig into the business and their priorities for the role. This will be a mix of you learning from them, them learning about you, and getting a mutual sense of whether you’ll work well together. The exact structure will vary depending on the CEO or founder, and it will give you an understanding of what kind of person they are to work with.</p>  <p>One-on-one discussions with a wide smattering of peer executives and members of the team that you would manage. These vary widely across companies, and it is surprisingly common for the interviews to be poorly coordinated—for example, the same topics may come up multiple times across different interviewers. This is somewhat frustrating. Generally, it means the company is missing someone with the right position, experience, and energy to invest into designing the loop. I’ve had these interviews turn into general chats, <a href="https://increment.com/teams/do-engineering-managers-need-to-be-technical/">programming screens</a>, architecture interviews, and anything else you can imagine. All I can say is: Roll with it to the best of your ability.</p>  <p>Presentation interview to the executive team, your directors, or a mix of both. Usually, you’ll be asked to run a 60-minute presentation describing your background, a point of view on what’s important for the business moving forward, your understanding of what you would focus on in the new role if hired, and your plan for your first 90 days.</p>  <p>Here are a few tips that I’ve found effective for these interviews:</p>  <p>Ask an interviewer for feedback on your presentation before the session.</p>  <p>Ask what other candidates have done that was particularly well received.</p>  <p>Make sure to follow the prompt directly.</p>  <p>Prioritize where you want to spend time in the presentation (on the highest-impact topics).</p>  <p>Make sure to leave time for questions (while also having enough bonus content to fill the time if there aren’t many).</p>  <p>If this sounds surprisingly vague and a bit random, then you’ve read it correctly. Gone are the days of cramming in all the right answers. Now, it’s a matter of reading each individual effectively and pairing the right response to their perspective. If that feels arbitrary, keep in mind that navigating various perspectives will be a significant part of your role as an executive going forward!</p> Negotiating the Contract <p>Once a company decides to make you an offer, you enter into the negotiation phase. While the general rules of negotiation still apply—particularly, don’t start negotiating until the company knows it wants to hire you—this is a moment when it’s important to remember that these are one of one jobs. Compensation consultants and investors will have recommended pay ranges, but each company only hires one Engineering executive at a time, and every company is unique.</p><p>Fair pay will vary greatly depending on the company, the size of its business, your location, and your own background. Your best bet will be reaching out to peers in similar roles to understand their compensation. I’ve found folks to be surprisingly willing to share compensation details. It’s also helpful to read DEF 14A filings for public companies, which explain their top executives’ base, bonus, and equity compensation (for example, here is <a href="https://www.splunk.com/en_us/about-splunk/investors.html">Splunk’s DEF 14A from 2022</a>).</p><p>There are a few aspects of this negotiation that are sufficiently different from earlier compensation negotiations:</p><p>Equity</p><p>Equity is issued in many formats: stock options, Restricted Stock Units, and so on. Equity is also issued with many conditions: vesting periods (often 4 years), vesting cliffs before vesting accrues (often 1 year), and the duration of the period after you depart when you’re able to exercise options before they expire (often 90 days).</p><p>Most of these terms are negotiable in an executive offer, but it all comes down to the particular company you’re speaking with. You may be able to negotiate away your vesting cliff, and immediately start vesting monthly rather than waiting a year; or negotiate an extended post-departure exercise window, even if that isn’t an option more widely; or have the company issue you a loan to cover your exercise costs, which combined with early exercise might allow you to exercise for “free” except for the very real tax consequences.</p><p>To determine your negotiation strategy, I highly recommend consulting with a tax advisor, as the “best” option will depend on your particular circumstances.</p><p>Equity acceleration</p><p>Equity acceleration is another negotiation point around equity. This is worth calling out as it’s common in executive offers, and extremely uncommon in other cases. Acceleration allows you to vest equity immediately if certain conditions are met. Many consider this a standard condition for a startup contract, although there are many executives who don’t have an acceleration clause.</p><p>One topic that gets perhaps undue attention is the distinction between single and double trigger acceleration. “Single trigger” acceleration has only one condition to be met (for example, your company is acquired), whereas “double trigger” acceleration will specify two conditions (for example, your company is acquired and you lose your job). My sense is that people like to talk about single and double triggers because it makes them sound knowledgeable about the topic rather than it being a particularly nuanced aspect of the discussion.</p><p>Severance packages</p><p>Severance packages can be negotiated, guaranteeing compensation after you exit the role. There is little consistency on this topic. Agreements range from executives at very small companies that have pre-negotiated a few months’ salary as a severance package, to executives leaving highly compensated roles that require their new company to make them whole on the compensation they’re leaving behind. There are also many executive contracts that don’t pre-negotiate severance at all, leaving the negotiation until the departure (when you admittedly have limited leverage).</p><p>Bonus</p><p>Bonus size and calculation can be negotiated. On average, bonus tends to be a larger component of roles outside of engineering, such as a sales executive, but like everything, this is company- and size-specific. A CTO at a public company might have their bonus be equal in size to their salary. A CTO at a Series C company might have a 20% bonus. A CTO at a 50-person company might have no bonus at all.</p><p>In addition to the size of your bonus, you may be able to negotiate the conditions for earning it. This won’t matter with companies that rely on a shared bonus goal for all executives (sometimes excluding sales), but may matter a great deal with other companies that employ bespoke, per-executive goals instead.</p><p>Parental leave</p><p>Parental leave can be negotiated. For example, some companies might only offer paid parental leave after a year of service, but you can absolutely negotiate to include that after a shorter amount of service. (It’s worth noting that this is often negotiable in less senior roles, as well.)</p><p>Start date</p><p>Start date is generally quite easy to negotiate in less senior roles but can be unexpectedly messy for executive roles. The reason it gets messy is that the hiring company often has an urgent need for the role to be filled, while also wanting to see a great deal of excitement from the candidate about joining.</p><p>The quiet part is that many recruiters and companies have seen executive candidates accept but later not join due to an opposing offer being sweetened, which makes them uncomfortable delaying, particularly for candidates who have been negotiating with other companies, including their current one.</p><p>Support</p><p>Support to perform your role successfully is another point that can be negotiated. The typical example of vain requests for support are guaranteed business- or first-class seats on business travel, but there are other dimensions of support that will genuinely impact your ability to perform your role. For example, negotiating for an executive assistant can free up hours every week for focus work, and negotiating a sufficient budget to staff your team can easily be the difference between a great and terrible first year.</p><p>The negotiation phase is the right time to ask for whatever you’ll need to succeed in the role. You’ll never have an easier time to ensure you and your organization can succeed.</p><p>Negotiate knowing that anything is possible but remember that you have to work with the people you’re negotiating with after the negotiation ends. If you push too many times, you won’t be the first candidate to have their offer pulled because the offering company has lost confidence that you really want to be there.</p> Deciding to Take the Job <p>Once you get an offer for an executive position, it can be remarkably hard to say no. The recruiters you’re working with will push you to accept. The company you’re speaking with will push you to accept. You’ll have invested a great deal of work into the process, and that will bias you toward wanting to accept as well.</p><p>It’s also challenging to evaluate an executive offer, because ultimately you’re doing two very difficult things. First, you’re trying to predict the company’s future trajectory, which is hard even for venture capitalists who do it a lot (and they’re solving for an easier problem as they get to make many concurrent investments, and you can only have one job at a time). Second, you’re trying to make a decision that balances all of your needs, which a surprising number of folks get wrong (including taking prestigious or high-paying jobs that they know they’re going to hate, but just can’t say no to).</p><p>I can’t really tell you whether to accept your offer, but there are a few steps that I would push you to take before finalizing your decision:</p>  <p>Spend enough time with the CEO to be sure you’ll enjoy working with them, and that you’ll trust them to lead the company. While it changes a bit as companies scale, and particularly as they go public, the CEO is the person who will be deciding company direction, determining the members of the executive team, and taking responsibility to resolve the trickiest decisions.</p>  <p>Speak to at least one member of their board. Admittedly, board members won’t directly tell you anything too spicy, but their willingness to meet with you is an important signal, and it’s the best opportunity to start building your relationship with the board.</p>  <p>Make sure you’ve spoken with every member of the executive team that you’d work with regularly. Sometimes you’ll miss someone in your interview process due to scheduling issues, and it’s important to chat with everyone and make sure they’re folks you can build an effective working relationship with.</p>  <p>Make sure they’ve actually answered your questions. I once interviewed to be a company’s head of Engineering, and they refused to share their current valuation with me! I pushed a few times, but ultimately they told me it was unreasonable to ask, and I decided I couldn’t move forward with a company that wouldn’t even share their valuation with an executive candidate.<br><br>Don’t assume they’ll disclose this information after you join the company if they won’t tell you when trying to convince you to accept their offer. You will never have more leverage to get questions answered than during the hiring process: If it’s important and they won’t answer, be willing to walk away.</p>  <p>If the company has recently had executives depart, see if you can get an understanding for why. This could be learned through mutual friends with the departed executive, or even chatting with them directly. Sometimes you’ll even have executives who interviewed you depart before, or shortly after, you join. You should absolutely reach out to them and understand the reasons for their departure.</p>  <p>As you work through these steps, ask yourself: Are you still excited? Have you explained your thinking about the role to at least two friends (who didn’t raise any concerns)? If the answer to these questions is yes, then take the job!</p> Not Getting the Job <p>You can’t talk about running an Engineering executive search without talking about not getting the job. Who doesn’t have a story of getting contacted by a recruiter who then ghosts them after an initial screen? A public company recently invited a friend of mine to interview in their CTO search. They got my friend very excited, and then notified them the next week that they had already tentatively filled the role. I’ve had first discussions with CEOs where we both immediately knew we wouldn’t be a good fit to work together. I’ve discussed roles where both I and the CEO wanted to move forward, but where I lacked a specific skill they felt was required to succeed (for example, deep experience in machine learning).</p><p>Although rejection isn’t fun, the perspective that I find helpful is: The goal of your search is not to find an executive job, but rather to find an executive job where you will thrive. It’s much better to realize a job isn’t the right fit for you before taking it, and each opportunity that doesn’t move forward is for the best.</p>   <p>Gergely again. I hope you have enjoyed this in-depth look into how to get a coveted engineering executive role, via The Engineering Executive’s Primer. </p><p><a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-engineering-executives/9781098149475/">Check out the full book</a></p><p>Many things Will discusses above are open secrets among engineering leaders; like that each executive role and hiring process is unique, and CTO roles at different companies often have vastly different processes, expectations, and compensation ranges!</p><p>Nearer the heights, compensation also becomes more negotiable; not only equity and salary, but also equity acceleration. That’s why, when negotiating a compensation package in a new country, it’s sensible to invest in tax advice about <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/equity-for-software-engineers/">the equity component</a> from a local accountant or equity expert. I recently spoke with an engineering director in San Francisco who was offered a CTO role with generous equity in Germany; but equity taxation is quite different there and they were researching it, first.</p><p>The rest of this book keeps up the quality, with lots of behind-the-scenes insights. If you’ve gotten something from this excerpt, you’ll likely get even more from the rest. So, if you’re an engineering executive, or want to become one, I reckon <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-engineering-executives/9781098149475/">The Engineering Executive’s Primer</a> is a very useful volume, as the author hoped for.&nbsp;</p><p>This week, there won’t be a new issue of The Pulse on Thursday, as <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/about#%C2%A7publishing-schedule-and-holidays">I’m on spring break</a>.

<p>Among all artists, writers alone suffer the illusion that the world needs to hear what they have to say.</p>
<p>I thought that line, or something like it, came from Rollo May, probably in The Courage to Create. But <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Courage_to_Create/Oj_Z1xImAwoC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;bsq=writers">a search within that book</a> says no. <a href="https://chatgpt.com/c/cce36df1-9f54-4c89-8f0c-94cb65db2176">ChatGPT</a> and <a href="https://gemini.google.com/app/555816f12830ff6f">Gemini</a> both tell me May didn’t say it anywhere.</p>
<p>Still, I think it’s true that writers write because they have to. They can’t not write. It’s what they do, how they live.&nbsp;And I’m one of them.</p>
<p>The need to write is for me a vivid fact this morning, a few days past a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter_ablation">catheter ablation</a> on my heart. There is so much I need to say, because I suffer the illusion that the world needs to hear it. Does it?</p>
<p>I am sure <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._S._Lewis">C.S. Lewis</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien">J.R.R. Tolkein</a> had the same affliction. I am also sure that the world is better for having read both of them, even if the world could have lived without their writing.</p>
<p>As for time, I have had twelve more years to write than Lewis got, so far, and five less than Tolkein.</p>
<p>Time to say what?</p>
<p>I want to say that <a href="https://projectvrm.org/2024/03/20/personal-ai-at-vrm-day-and-iiw/">personal AI</a> will do far more for all of us than what we will ever get from AI as a corporate service. And to say it better than I just did.</p>
<p>I want to say that we will do better with rulers who care about people than with rulers who merely rule. And to say that better than I just did.</p>
<p>I want to complete the work of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McPhee">John McPhee</a> by reporting as best I can what has happened to the great characters that anchored every one of his essays and books. But that project is not on the back burner. It’s in the fridge, where I’ve kept it for decades (while continuing to read the entire McPhee oeuvre, much of it repeatedly).</p>
<p>Speaking of burning, I am impelled by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_Thomas">Dylan Thomas</a>, who wrote “Do not go gentle into That Good Night,” before dying at just thirty-nine. The poem was for his father:</p>
<p>Old age should burn and rave at close of day,<br>
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
<p>And so I do.</p>

<p>I continue to develop my interest and some proficiency in AI. I am specifically focusing on Microsoft’s Copilot and Azure offerings. How did I end on that choice? I used to be a Microsoft MVP and also have a personal Visual Studio license that comes with $150 a month in Azure credits. So I have a long history in the Microsoft stack and tools plus some credits to play with each month. Those credits don’t go far when dealing with Azure AI pricing but I appreciate them. This last weekend I was going through an exercise I found on connecting up Azure AI search with Azure OpenAI layered on top, and then letting that be the foundation for a Copilot. You can find the excellent video by Lisa Crosbie <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmRmdCpnq8M&amp;t=591s">here</a>. This is a post on what I encountered that took me a while to overcome so that if you have a similar set of conditions you may spend less time to get&nbsp;running.</p><p>The crux of my arrangement and some heartache is the personal Visual Studio Azure subscription id; an emphasis on “personal”. This is where I have the monthly credits, but you need a business Microsoft account to use the Copilot&nbsp;Studio.</p><p>Here is the short end of it. If you can call this short. It’s complicated, what I did to get there, but doesn’t have to be too complicated for you. Here are the steps I went through so you don’t have&nbsp;to:</p>  I needed to apply for a Microsoft OpenAI Studio preview&nbsp;access.  I needed to use a non-personal email. No outlook.com, gmail&nbsp;etc.  Once approved the following day when trying to kick off a Copilot creation from the deployed OpenAi instance it asked me to log in and would only accept a business or school Microsoft account — my personal account wouldn’t&nbsp;work.  I created a new Microsoft business account by subscribing to Office 365 basic&nbsp;business  I tried to kick off the Copilot creation from the OpenAI deployment on my personal account and when it asked me to log in for the Copilot I put in my new business Microsoft account. It complained that it couldn’t connect with the Azure OpenAi deployment. Which made total sense- it was under a different account than the Copilot I was trying to create, but I had to try&nbsp;it.  So, I subscribed to Azure using that newly minted business account. It came with $200 credit the first&nbsp;month.  I tried to apply for OpenAI using the “business” email address the Azure subscription gave me when subscribing to Azure- a ruminio944.onmicrosoft.com domain.  It immediately denied me saying that the email address was a personal email account. I wasn’t expecting that.  I had a dormant domain sitting in GoDaddy (who doesn’t) and added it to my Azure account as a domain and set up a shared email for that domain. I now had factraft@factraft.com email address. I am sure I could have set up an email box directly on GoDaddy for the domain but this was more fun and a learning experience.  I now had a MS business login with an Azure subscription and $200 credit to play with and what should be considered a business&nbsp;email.  I applied for the OpenAI Studio Preview again this time using my new Azure subscription id and new factraft email. I expected it to be denied as all the other information such as name, address, website etc. was the same as I had already submitted and been approved for under my personal Azure subscription id. Surprisingly, the next day I received a welcome message for OpenAi Studio&nbsp;Preview.  I went through the video exercise in my new Azure account and most things worked as in the&nbsp;video.   The Lesson <p>To make it work you need the OpenAI Studio Preview which requires a business email address, a website, and an approved use case to request admission to the preview, and that is no guarantee of approval. You’ll need a business Microsoft account to log into in order to kick off the Copilot studio. Personal emails and a personal Microsoft account won’t cut it. I created a business Microsoft account by subscribing to Office 365 business basic for about $8. Then added an Azure instance to this with $200 credits for the first month. Then I was off to the races- mostly. I was able to make it all work for a mere mortal for the cost of about $8, the one month Office 365 subscription, and a partial days effort&nbsp;. All in all, not bad. I’ll make another write up on what I discovered in the creation itself. If just the right person(s) finds this trying to play with Azure OpenAI and Copilot studio then it might save them a fair amount of&nbsp;time.</p>

<p>This will be my last post for a few weeks. During my trips down to Arkansas, I’ve been reading Gary Zukav’s 1979, “The Dancing Wu Li Masters,” a lay person’s guide to the “new” physics that emerged out of meetings he had at Esalen, home base for the human potential movement. I recognize there continue to be many questions about quantum mechanics. At this point, I am leaning towards Hugh Everett’s “Many World’s Theory” and John Wheeler’s&nbsp; “Participatory Universe.” I don’t claim to have any of this pinned down, and yet I wanted to share some thoughts I’ve been having on relativity, perception, spacetime, lattices, and construction of personalized “realities” using consciousness and information theory.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When Leo first started his work on Web3 tokenization of natural capital, he looked into the origins of the International Geophysical Year, use of radio isotopes to track energy transfer in ecosystems, and UNESCO’s “Man and the Biosphere” (Noosphere?) programme. I am starting to think that the focus on One Health, climate, and the UN Sustainable Development Goals could actually be about relativity – employing digital identity and Web3 to situate individual representations of consciousness within webs of relationship over time. That data could then be used not only to discern patterns but to incorporate game mechanics towards some form of networked collective manifestation.</p>
<p>Individual experiences of the ant computer would be shaped by each participant’s environmental context. Through gamification and spatial computing we, as agents, would emit signals that could be used to coordinate a vast sociotechnical computational system of domesticated consciousness. But first, the system would need to know where each of us is at a given time, what information flows we have consumed, what our perception of reality is, and how best to use the archetypal fields that surround us to nudge us towards pre-programmed goal-oriented behaviors, how to optimize the agents with the least amount of friction. Go with the flow….</p>
<p>Thinking of carbon-credit behaviors in this way – as gamified agent signaling within fractal, nested complex systems – has some legs I think. In any event, it is a much more interesting scenario than Klaus wants to turn you into a puppet, take all your things, and make you eat bugs, right?</p>
<p>So here is the video I made last night. </p>
<p></p>
<p>It will be interesting to watch as the RFK Jr. campaign tries to weave together the split personalities of Market-Based Environmental Solutions Bobby and Health FreeDOM Bobby. Liam Sturgess’s initial attempt was rather weak. </p>
<p><a href="https://thekennedybeacon.substack.com/p/has-the-national-resources-defense"></a></p>
<p></p><a href="https://www.depauw.edu/news-media/latest-news/details/19648/"></a><a href="https://www.depauw.edu/news-media/latest-news/details/19648/">https://www.depauw.edu/news-media/latest-news/details/19648/</a><p></p>
<p>I expect a lot more information flows will need to pour forth in order to create a narrative compelling enough to get people to sign on to big data, AI for good green progress. Stay tuned.</p>
<p>This is the excerpt I read. Below it are screenshots of the featured maps if you’d like to explore further. It’s quite fascinating to see how the various threads spread out over many maps have come together around the Camelot candidate.</p>

We thought the Web was a library. Turns out it’s not. (Image via ChatGPT 4o.)
<p>Before there were search engines, there were directories. The biggest and best-known was Yahoo. On the first graphical browser (Mosaic), it looked like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thismarketerslife.it/site/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/yahoo-nel-1994.png"></a></p>
<p>The directory idea made sense, because the Web is laid out like the directory in your computer. There is a “domain” with a “location” or a “site,” containing something after the last / in a path of /something/something/something. Geeks call these directories too, and the string of somethings a path. Directories in computing also follow an outline format: heads, subheads, and subheads of subheads.</p>
<p>While this design is boundlessly flexible, it also suggests durability, if not permanence, because it’s good to find stuff where it rightly goes and to find it in the same place over and over again.</p>
<p>That was what Yahoo assumed in the early days of the Web—as did everyone who bought a domain name. I’ve had <a href="http://searls.com">searls.com</a> since 1995. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Winer">Dave Winer</a> (father of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Winer#Early_work_in_outliners">outlining</a> and progenitor of much else) has had <a href="https://scripting.com">Scripting.com</a> for even longer (and has a lot more in that domain).</p>
<p>But we don’t own domain names. We rent them. And the World Wide Web isn’t a library. It’s a whiteboard with stuff written on it. Some of that stuff is located on directory paths. A lot more is coughed up by database systems on an as-needed basis.</p>
<p>The Yahoo directory failed. In its place search engines appeared. Search engines don’t catalog the Web like a library might. They index it. That means they send crawlers down the Web’s directory paths, recording everything they see into a searchable index. I explain <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2021/08/15/beyond-the-web/">here</a> how that works and where this went:</p>
<blockquote><p></p>
<p>The Web is a haystack.</p>
<p>This isn’t what <a href="https://customercommons.org/a-new-way/">Tim Berners-Lee</a> had in mind when he invented the Web. Nor is it what Jerry Yang and David Filo had in mind when they invented&nbsp;<a href="https://money.cnn.com/gallery/technology/2015/03/03/yahoo-20-years-hits-flops/10.html">Jerry and David’s Guide to the World Wide Web</a>, which later became&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!">Yahoo</a>. Jerry and David’s model for the Web was a library, and Yahoo was to be the first catalog for it. This made sense, given the prevailing conceptual frames for the Web at the time:&nbsp;real estate and publishing.</p>
<p>Both of those are still with us today. We frame the Web as real estate when we speak of “sites” with “locations” in “domains” with “addresses” you can “visit” and “browse”—then shift to publishing when we speak of “files” and “pages,” that we “author,” “edit,” “post,” “publish,” “syndicate” and store in “folders” within a “directory.” Both frames suggest durability if not permanence. Again, kind of like a library.</p>
<p>But once we added personal movement (“surf,” “browse”) and a vehicle for it (the browser), the Web became a World Wide Free-for-all. Literally. Anyone could publish, change and remove whatever they pleased, whenever they pleased. The same went for organizations of every kind, all over the world. And everyone with a browser could find their way to and through all of those spaces and places, and enjoy whatever “content” publishers chose to put there. Thus the Web grew into billions of sites, pages, images, databases, videos, and other stuff, with most of it changing constantly.</p>
<p>The result was a heaving heap of fuck-all.*</p></blockquote>
<p>Back in 2005, I <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8549">wrote in Linux Journal about a split</a> between the “static” Web that was like a library (with its “locations,” “sites,” and “domains” you could “visit” and “browse”), and the “live” Web of blogs and posts. Then social media came along, and the live branch of the Web outgrew the static Web’s trunk.</p>
<p>Last week <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/28/24166177/google-search-ranking-algorithm-leak-documents-link-seo">came news</a> that a leak revealed lots of interesting poop about how Google actually ranks search results. Here are two things I don’t need those leaked documents to tell me:</p>
 
 Google favors the present over the past, the current over the archival. 
 Google no longer indexes, or ranks very old Web pages. 
 
<p>I speak from experience here, because I have some old pages that are on the Web but don’t seem to be indexed, meaning searches don’t find them. I also have Easter eggs on a couple of those pages: words that exist in no language but made those pages easy to find when I did keyword searches for them. Now I get “No results found for _____.” (I won’t reveal the word because I want to keep testing Google.)</p>
<p>Countless publications have also come and gone on the Web without leaving a trace. Upside was a gigantic publication from the Nineties through the dotcom boom. Not a trace of it remains. Far as I know, nothing remains of Fast Company‘s early issues.</p>
<p>But hey, God bless the <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a>. <a href="https://archive.org/details/PC-Mag-1982-12/page/n53/mode/2up?q=searls">Here’s a piece</a> I wrote for&nbsp;<a href="https://archive.org/details/PC-Mag-1982-12/mode/2up?q=searls">PC Magazine in December 1982</a> about a PC application that taught card counting in blackjack:</p>
<p></p>
<p>As the evanescence of “content” increases, so does the importance of archives.</p>
<p>So maybe stop reading here and start reading <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2024/04/21/archives-as-commons/">here</a>. We have a lot of work to do.</p>

<p>Programming note: next week, I’ll be <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/about#%C2%A7publishing-schedule-and-holidays">on spring break</a>, spending time in Florida, visiting my in-laws. This will mean no The Pulse on Thursday: but there will still be a Tuesday article, as usual. Thank you for your understanding and support!</p><p>The Pulse is <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/s/the-pulse">a series</a> covering insights, patterns, and trends within Big Tech and startups. Notice an interesting event or trend? <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/contact/">Send me a message</a>.</p><p>Today, we cover:</p>  <p>Industry pulse. Cloudflare handles an extra 12M req/sec with no issues, how does being a PM at Google or Meta compare, and are nearly 1 in 10 of all developers worldwide using GitHub Copilot? And more.</p>  <p>GitHub’s AI-assisted developer workflow vision: Copilot Workspace. Several startups are aiming to build an AI coding tool that goes beyond GitHub Copilot. With exceptionally fast execution, GitHub seems to have beaten them to it. It’s called GitHub Copilot Workspace, and doesn’t aim to replace devs. A review of this developer-driven, AI-assisted workflow, including insider details from the GitHub team.</p>  <p>Google lays off devs while business booms. Google made layoffs in its Python and Flutter platform teams, right as the company’s stock price hit an all-time high.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Good time for tech scaleups fundraising and IPOs. It’s been a while since we’ve had so much positive news on tech IPOs, and late and early-stage fundraising. Hopefully, this trend continues!</p>  <p>Platform scaleup buys feature startup: WorkOS acquires Warrant. Warrant is an innovative fine-grained access control seed-stage devtools startup, built on the principles of Google’s authorization system. In what looks like a win-win outcome, WorkOS has acquired it, intending to keep intact the team, product, and all existing customers. Details on this acquisition from the founder and CEO of WorkOS.</p>   1. Industry pulse  Cloudflare doesn’t notice 12M extra req/sec <p>Cloudflare engineering director Benjamin Yule shared an interesting non-event:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9feceb27-e71f-449a-a4bd-f54327a710a2_1080x354.png">    </a> <p>I have so many questions as 12.5 million requests per second is a huge load! A few thousand requests per second is usually considered high, and handling a load in the millions surely requires thousands of servers (if not more!) to be spun up to handle it.</p><p>How much load a single server can handle depends on how long a request takes to handle, how much memory a request uses, and then calculating whether a request is limited in CPU or memory. Whichever resource (CPU capacity or memory) runs out first determines a server’s maximum load. You can push things pretty far with clever workarounds; it’s how the WhatsApp team <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120709235656/http://www.erlang-factory.com/upload/presentations/558/efsf2012-whatsapp-scaling.pdf">served 2 million requests per second</a> on a server with 24 cores and 100GB RAM, back in 2012!</p><p>In this case, Cloudflare soaked up the load by using <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/">Cloudflare Workers</a>, a serverless application platform, which <a href="https://x.com/bjyule/status/1784172632910283064">spun up</a> 40,000 CPU cores (an average of 320 requests/second per CPU core.) The tweet says the Cloudflare Workers team didn’t even notice the increase, which suggests they could be handling 50-100x more load on the service! If we assume a 100x load, that could mean operating 4 million CPU cores or more simultaneously, just for Workers. By comparison, we previously covered travel booking service Agoda <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/124842294/agoda-in-numbers">operating</a> a total of 300,000 physical cores and 600,000 virtual ones. It’s likely Cloudflare is operating more than 10x this number.</p> Do nearly 1 in 10 developers use GitHub Copilot?

In every issue, I cover challenges at Big Tech and startups through the lens of engineering managers and senior engineers. To get articles like this in your inbox, every week, subscribe:</p><p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/subscribe?">Subscribe now</a></p><blockquote> Q: “As a software engineer, I’d like to learn more about security engineering. What’s a good way to understand this vast field?” </blockquote><p>This is the second and final part of exploring this important – and, yet, often intimidating! – topic of security engineering. Giving us an overview of this field is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nieletdmello">Nielet D'Mello</a>: a security engineer at Datadog (previously at Intel and McAfee).</p><p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/security-engineering">In Part 1</a> we already covered:</p>  <p>Myths and misconceptions about security engineering</p>  <p>History of security engineering</p>  <p>The present</p>  <p>A mental model: seven core dimensions to think about application security</p>  <p>Towards a secure software development lifecycle (SDLC).</p>  <p>In today’s issue, Nielet takes us through:</p>  <p>Defining the criticality of a system. Security dimensions to consider as we talk about a service or systems’s criticality.</p>  <p>Scoring a system’s criticality. The “napkin math” approach for scoring a system’s security criticality, and a case study to bring all it to life.</p>  <p>Threat modeling. A criteria for threat modeling, and pre-work for this exercise.</p>  <p>Security paved roads. For platform teams, building pre-approved security solutions and configurations is pragmatic.</p>  <p>“Defense in depth,” “least privilege,” and “zero trust.” A strategy, a principle, and a security model. Use in combination to build more layered, secure systems.</p>  <p>The bottom of this article could be cut off in some email clients. <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/security-engineering-part-2">Read the full article uninterrupted, online.</a></p><p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/384a2ad1-c704-41d4-81a7-60ac441f7fec">Read the full article online</a></p><p>With that, it’s over to Nielet.</p> Common security engineering terms <p>As a brief refresher, we use three terms frequently in this article, so let’s start by defining them:</p>  <p>Vulnerability: An exploitable flaw or weakness in a system’s design, implementation or deployment</p>  <p>Threat: The potential for a threat actor to exploit the vulnerability</p>  <p>Risk: Loss or damage that could occur when a threat actualizes</p>   1. Defining the criticality of a service or system <p>Do all services and systems need to invest in a security design review? Not necessarily, as the need for a review depends on a service’s or system’s business risk profile. Vulnerabilities will surface as you identify security concerns in a system’s design and architecture. Code reviews and dynamic testing also surface security issues.</p><p>For critical systems, it’s worth investing in processes like security design reviews. However, how do you decide just how critical&nbsp; a service or system is? Use the dimensions below for a better sense of this:</p>  <p>Business purpose</p>  <p>Public access</p>  <p>Custom access controls</p>  <p>Users of the system</p>  <p>Deployment environments</p>  <p>Data classification</p>   Business purpose <p>What are the primary objectives and functions of the service or system within the context of the organization's business operations? Identify how the service contributes to achieving business goals, generating revenue, or providing stakeholder value. To figure out the risks, it’s essential to know:</p>  <p>The nature of business</p>  <p>The industry the business operates in</p>  <p>Regulatory requirements</p>  <p>Sensitivity of data involved. For example, is it restricted, or subject to PII?</p>   Public access <p>Is the service accessible to external users outside of the organization's network, or the general public? Public access systems offer expanded attack surfaces.</p><p>For these, you need to assess the potential exposure to security threats and risks associated with providing services over the internet, or other public networks, as these systems are at a much higher risk of automated bot attacks, for example.</p> Custom access controls <p>All systems need custom access controls for their data, apps and resources to determine who has access to it and in what circumstances. Role-based access control (RBAC,) or attribute-based access control (ABAC,) are two examples of custom access controls. These have specific access permissions defined for users and identities, and restrictions tailored to the service’s requirements and security needs to ensure confidentiality.&nbsp;</p><p>The decision to build custom access controls is usually made with the following factors in mind:</p>  <p>Granularity</p>  <p>Dynamic decisions based on real-time information and conditions</p>  <p>Implementation efforts</p>  <p>Simplicity</p>  <p>Flexibility</p>   Users of the system <p>What different types of users interact with the service? This is key information for defining:</p>  <p>User roles</p>  <p>Authentication mechanisms</p>  <p>Access requirements</p>  <p>User activity auditing</p>  <p>Threat detections associated with anomalous user behavior patterns&nbsp;</p>  <p>Adherence to regulatory compliance</p>  <p>The last one is especially important. Several regulatory frameworks and industry standards mandate the protection of sensitive data through user identification and access controls. Examples of such frameworks include the General Data Protection Regulation (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">GDPR</a>) and California Consumer Privacy Act (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Consumer_Privacy_Act">CCPA</a>). In these cases, putting these in place is not “just” about making the system secure; it’s about what ensures the system is compliant with privacy and security regulation.</p><p>Users include:</p>  <p>Internal users: employees, administrators</p>  <p>External users: customers, partners, third-party vendors.&nbsp;</p>   Deployment environments <p>Development, testing, staging, and production environments in which the service operates. Each environment may have different security requirements and configurations. These varying requirements depend on:</p>  <p>Level of risk tolerance</p>  <p>Need for data protection</p>  <p>Data availability requirements</p>  <p>Compliance with industry standards, regulations, and legal requirements.&nbsp;</p>  <p>For example, a staging environment may have broader internal employee access, meaning it can be accessed by most (if not all) employees. However, the production environment tends to have much stricter access control: only specific employees or groups can access it, and even fewer will have the rights to deploy to it. And while the staging environment is unlikely to have data that is considered confidential customer data: the production environment will! So the production environment will have much more strict data security and monitoring measures deployed on its&nbsp; infrastructure.</p><p>It’s pretty common for an environment to be a shared infrastructure for various services. When this is the case, robust security controls (like stricter isolation for applications and databases) are even more important! <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/multitenant/overview">Multi-tenant architectures</a> are a good example for such “shared infrastructure”&nbsp; where stricter security controls are necessary.</p> Data classification <p>This refers to labeling data based on sensitivity, confidentiality, and regulatory requirements. Understanding the classification of data helps determine:</p>  <p>Appropriate security controls</p>  <p>Suitable encryption methods</p>  <p>Access restrictions for safeguarding sensitive information and preventing unauthorized disclosure or misuse.</p>   2. Scoring a system’s “criticality” <p>It’s helpful to calculate a criticality score for services. For this, I like to assign weights to the security dimensions. Below is a sample of how these scores could look. It’s just an example; simpler than I usually use, and it doesn’t encompass all factors relevant for every system. Just treat it as inspiration:</p><p>Now we’ve established the basic factors for understanding risk and criticality, we can do some napkin math with criticality scores, based on characteristics:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0335d804-37ee-4ab1-885f-e223ffdfa7d4_1332x1082.png">    </a>Calculating criticality, simplified: define dimensions by important security factors <p>A simple way to think about a total risk “score” is to add together the weights for each dimension. So, in this case: Total Risk Score = BP + PA + CAC + US + DE + DC.</p> Scoring criticality <p>Let’s take the example of building a payment system for an e-commerce site. It needs to process a high volume of transactions via credit cards, debit cards, and other payment methods. It also needs to have payment gateway integration, account for fraud prevention, and is subject to PCI DSS compliance.</p><p>Let’s do the napkin math for this system’s criticality:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F072e761f-d4de-4d1d-b04a-61f8907debd9_1364x1318.png">    </a>Scoring the criticality of this example system <p>We get the total risk score by adding up the dimensions. In this case, it comes to 15 out of a maximum of 18 points (3 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3.) This score indicates we are talking about a critical system from a security standpoint.</p><p>All companies have unique risk-scoring and risk-tracking processes. As a software engineer, you need to figure out what a “high” service risk score means, and at what point you should reach out to the security team at your organization, if there is one.</p> 3.

VC-JOSE-COSE secures VCDM payloads with JOSE, SD-JWT, or COSE signatures.  While I’m admittedly not a fan of JSON-LD, to the extent that Verifiable Credentials using the VCDM are in use, I’m committed to finishing a solid VC-JOSE-COSE specification so there is a simple, secure, standards-based way to sign these credentials.</p>
<p>Of course, there are lots of Verifiable Credential formats to choose from, and more on the way.  Choices already existing include ISO <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/69084.html">mDoc</a>, IETF <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-08.html">SD-JWT</a>, IETF <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-jose-json-web-proof-03.html">JSON Web Proof (JWP)</a>, and W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2024/CRD-vc-data-model-2.0-20240416/">VCDM</a>.

 Introduction 
 
 I opened the meeting and introduced <a href="https://jkatz05.com">Jonathan Katz</a>. 
 
 Presentation 
 
 
<p>Thank you for having me. I’m very excited to talk about this, and
extensions in general. I see a lot of folks here I know and recognize and
some new folks or folks I’ve not met in person yet.</p>
 
 
<p>Borrowed from the original presentation on TLEs from November of 2022, to
level set on why we built it. I know this is a slightly more advanced
audience, so some stuff that might seem relatively introductory to some of
you, though there is some material on the internals of extensions.</p>
 
 
<p>The premise is why we decided to build TLEs, what were the problems we’re
trying to solve. Part of it is just understanding Postgres extensions. In
general this group is very familiar with Extensions but there are two
points I want to hit on.</p>
 
 
<p>One of the things that excites me most about Postgres is that, when you
look back at Postgres as the Berkeley database project researching how to
create an object relational database, an accidental or intentional
features is not just that Postgres is an object-relational database, but
that Postgres is an extensible database, built from the get-go to be
able to add functionality without necessarily having to fork it.</p>
 
 
<p>Early on you’d have to Fork the database to add additional functionality,
but the beauty of the Postgres design was the ability to keep adding
functionality without forking.</p>
 
 
<p>It did require making changes to Postgres to further enhance that
capability, which we’ll discuss in a bit, but that’s a really powerful
concept.</p>
 
 
<p>The second point is that there is the large landscape of both open source
and Commercial extensions. I think a lot of folks in this group are very
familiar with the available open source extensions, but there are entire
businesses built on, effectively, commercial extensions on top of
Postgres. Again, that’s a really powerful notion!</p>
 
 
<p>It’s kind of like the Postgres economy: we created something that’s so
special that it’s able to spawn all these different businesses whether
it’s building things on top of Postgres or using Postgres as the heart of
their business. Extensions have a very large role to to to play in that.</p>
 
 
<p>Which gets us to the history of extensions. The Syntax for Postgres
extensions has been around for over a decade, since Postgres 9.1. I know
there’s folks here well familiar with building extensions prior to that
syntax! But we’re very grateful for the extension syntax because, as a
recovering application developer, I would say it made things a lot easier.</p>
 
 
<p>Instead of having to futz around the file system to figure out where to
install everything (wink wink nudge nudge on the topic today), you had a
very simple syntax. Once an extension is installed, I can <code>CREATE EXTENSION postgis</code> (or whatever extension) and there you go! I have
PostGIS installed.</p>
 
 
<p>Again, that’s really cool! Because anything we can do to make it simpler
to install and use extensions further drives their adoption, and
ultimately makes it even easier to develop and build applications with
Postgres and  continues to drive that forward.</p>
 
 
<p>So what can you build with Postgres, what extensions are available? It’s a
whole range of things. For starters, there are extensions that I call “the
ones that you take for granted”. If you’re using any monitoring tool
you’re likely running and you may not even realize
it. <code>pg_stat_statements</code> helps to aggregate statistics as queries execute
and bubbles it up to whatever monitoring tool you use. It’s a great tool
for performance tuning.</p>
 
 
<p>The example I like to give for my personal life was that, back when I was
an application developer trying to manage my own databases, I had some
query that was blocking my entire logical decoding system, so we weren’t
keeping up with transactions. Looking in <code>pg_stat_statements</code> I see a
recursive query where I should have had a <code>UNION</code> with <code>SELECT DISTINCT</code>
instead of a gigantic query that was amassing so many rows. Fixed it: I
had a 100x speed up in the query. Thank you <code>pg_stat_statements</code>!</p>
 
 
<p>Side note: I got to say, “hey, I sped up this query by 100x,” even though
it was my fault it was slow to begin with.</p>
 
 
<p>There are utility functions to help with data types. UID OSSP is very
widely used. Newer versions of Postgres have a random UUID function, but
previously, anytime you needed a UUI you would <code>CREATE EXTENSION "uuid-ossp"</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>The other fun thing about this extension is that developers
learned about SQL identifiers that require double quotes to
install the extension.</p>
 
 
<p>I think I saw Keith on here today. pg_partman! What’s really cool about
pg_partman too is that a lot of it is PL/pgSQL. This PL/pgSQL code
provides a way to manage partitions across all your tables in your entire
database. Again, that’s really powerful because Postgres has added
declarative partitioning in version 10, but pg_partman is still incredibly
useful because there are all sorts of aspects to partition management not
supported in Postgres today. This is another example where Postgres
provides the core functionality and you can use the extension to package
additional functionality that makes it easier for use.</p>
 
 
<p>Foreign data wrappers.Postgres has a whole interface to interface with
other databases. It could be other Postgres databases, other relational
databases, non-relational databases, file systems, etc. Postgres has a
C-level interface that allows you to design the calls to optimally use all
these different databases. Again, packaged up as an extension, being able
to add things as we go on.</p>
 
 
<p>I’ll wait till the end to answer questions this will be a relatively short
presentation, so we
should have some time for discussion</p>
 
 
<p>Last but not least, a little bit on PostGIS. I think this is one of the
most powerful aspects of Postgres. PostGIS itself is incredibly powerful
because you have a geospatial database that happens to be Postgres
underneath. A lot of heavy PostGIS users don’t even realize they’re using
Postgres! They think they’re using PostGIS. That is really the power of
Postgres extensibility in a nutshell: It looks like you have like a brand
new, domain-specific database – and yet underneath it it’s just boring
old Postgres doing all the things you expect a database to do. That is
also a very powerful notion/</p>
 
 
<p>Tobias Bussmann in chat: Many PostGIS users don’t know they are
using PostgreSQL 🤣</p>
 
 
<p>nils in chat: 🎉</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>To add a coda to it, you have pgRouting, an extension built on top of
PostGIS, which is built on top of Postgres. So you have a cascading effect
of extensions building on top of extensions building on top of Postgres.</p>
 
 
<p>So we’re supposed to talk about trusted language extensions. To really to
TLEs it’s important to understand the anatomy of an extension. There are
certain things that you need in order to have an extension: You need a
control file, which is kind of like your packaging manifest. it tells you
what’s in the extension. It goes into a directory.</p>
 
 
<p>You have SQL files, which effectively map out the objects that you’re
going to have in your database. If you have functions that need to map to
a C function or if you need to create a table access method in order to
build your new your new storage layer, the SQL files are the building
block.</p>
 
 
<p>If you have C- specific code, it goes in a library file or a shared object
file that gets stored in a library directory.</p>
 
 
<p>It’s a very simple layout. What’s cool is if you go to create an
extension, there’s a particular pattern that it forms: You need to know
that when you have an extension, the information in the control file goes
into the Postgres catalog. Then, if there are any functions or objects or
whatever in that extension, we need to install the object itself, but we
also need to make sure that there’s a dependency on the extension. That
way, if we need to remove the extension or upgrade it, we know all the
objects that we’ve collected.</p>
 
 
<p>So why this “extension building 101”? This gets at the heart of why we
built TLes. Because the first thing to notice is that we install
extensions directly on the file system. There are a lot of domains where
that’s restricted — certainly managed service providers.</p>
 
 
<p>I worked a lot with containers previously, and a container is effectively
an immutable file system: once you have things installed on it it’s
installed. You typically don’t want to give your app developers access to
your production systems, because your app developers are going to install
everything under the sun on them, myself included. You certainly want to
be able to restrict certain domains.</p>
 
 
<p>But we also don’t want to inhibit what developers want to build. We want
to make it as easy as possible for them to manage their code and be able
to install in different environments. That gets to another point beyond
restricting the file system. Some extensions may not be universally
available, depending on where you’re running them. You might be running an
extension on an on-premise environment that might not work in a managed
service provider. Or different managed service providers have different
extensions available.</p>
 
 
<p>The final bit — and something that I’ve definitely personally
experienced — is that, between major versions of Postgres, the API or
the ABI will change. These are the interface points at the C layer. When
they change it can break extensions. Ask any of the package managers how
much they need to nag people to upgrade their extensions: they always want
to make sure that they’re keeping it up-to-date, and ensuring that it’s
compatible.</p>
 
 
<p>But this can also lead to other issues, because as the end user, this
makes it challenging to perform major version upgrades — particularly if
I’m dependent on an extension that hasn’t been updated to work with the
latest version of Postgres. A subtle line of code change in Postgres could
end up breaking an extension.</p>
 
 
<p>Quick story: that actually happened to me while I was managing pg_tle. I
think it was a change in Postgres 15.1 actually broke something in the
pg_tle extension. I had to to fix it. I think that’s part of the point: if
you’re able to use a language that’s on top of C, and you have the C
layer abstracted away, in theory it could make it easier to perform major
version upgrades.</p>
 
 
<p>That leads into TLE.</p>
 
 
<p>I think there were two Notions behind trusted language extensions, or
TLEs, when they were initially designed. The first is giving power to app
developers to be able to build extensions. It’s actually one thing I
noticed as I started making the journey from  app developer to quasi-DBA
to, ultimately, product manager not writing code. Part of that Journey was
the power of putting some of my business logic in the database.</p>
 
 
<p>There’s always this tension between how much business logic to put in
application code versus the database. But there are certain things that
were just clear wins for me when they wer in the database. The first was a
lot of search functions I wrote where filtering data down to a very small
set in the database and returning to the application would save on network
time, processing time on the app side, etc. There were some very clear
wins by encapsulating them in functions.</p>
 
 
<p>But also solving things that were just much easier to solve in the
database. Having specific data types that solve a particular problem —
geospatial extensions keep coming to mind, pgvector dealing with Vector
data, and being able to store it in a database without having delegate it
out into an application certainly is a is a clear win.</p>
 
 
<p>The other thing was installing extensions. I think the notion of
portability is very powerful. If I
have a way to manage my extensions from a SQL interface, it
makes it much easier to move it between different systems.</p>
 
 
<p>Now, we do need to be careful as soon as we start saying “SQL interface”.
I don’t want to suggest that we should have a SQL interface to ship C code
everywhere We know there are some challenges with C code. C is highly
performant, you can effectively build anything under the sun using C, but
it’s not memory-safe, and it’s very easy if you’re not familiar with what
you’re doing — and even if you are familiar with what you’re doing! —
you can easily make mistakes that could either lead to crashes or or
possibly worse.</p>
 
 
<p>As we were thinking about all this with TLE, there’s three things. First,
we need an interface to be able to install and manage extension code
effectively regardless of environment. We need a SQL interface to do that.
We also need to make sure there’s an appropriate trust boundary. Now, Postgres
provides a trust boundary with the notion of a trusted language. But
there are other things we need to
build with trust, as well.</p>
 
 
<p>For example, you might not want everyone in your environment to be
be able to install the a TLE, so we need to
make sure there’s appropriate access controls there.</p>
 
 
<p>Finally, we need a way to package it up — which I
think is what we’re going to talk about at the Extension
Summit.</p>
 
 
<p>If there are any takeaways from why we built TLE (I think this is the the
slide that encapsulates it), it’s that, by using by using Postgres’s
built-in trusted language interface it allows you to write extension code
in languages that we know are going to respect Postgres security
boundaries.</p>
 
 
<p>Postgres has this definition of a trusted language which, if you look at
for it, you have to effectively dance around the documentation to find it.</p>
 
 
<p>But effectively I’d summarize as, if you allow an unprivileged user to
write code in a trusted language, they can’t do anything to escalate their
privileges, access the file system directly, or do anything that would
violate Postgres’s security boundary.</p>
 
 
<p>It’s a pretty good definition. Arguably, the easiest way to violate that
definition is that you as the database administrator mark an untrusted
language as trusted in the catalog. But I strongly advise to not do that!</p>
 
 
<p>What trusted languages are available. There’s a great wiki page called the
“PL Matrix” on the Postgres Wiki that shows the status of all all the
known PLs in Postgres and whether they’re trusted or not. I suggest
looking at that.</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him) in chat: <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PL_Matrix">https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PL_Matrix</a></p>
 
 
<p>Jeremy S in chat: Linux had kernel modules forever, but many people
were rightfully hesitant because a kernel module could easily crash
your entire system. One of the reasons eBPF is exploding today is
because it’s verified and safe and enables code (like entire
networking apps) to run directly in the linux kernel.</p>
<p>I see TLE similarly</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>A big thing regarding a trusted language is performance. There are a
variety of trusted languages, and they all have different properties you
know around them. The ones I’m showing today are the ones available in RDS
Postgres. But the reason I want to show them is that, part of the idea of
trusted language extensions is allowing app developers who may be less
familiar with C to write extension code and access some of the same
internals as a C extension, but from one of these languages.</p>
 
 
<p>Here are some of the known trusted languages today that work with TLE. If
you’re using the TlE open source project, you can use any available
trusted language — or you can use untrusted languages an just use the
TLE packaging mechanism. In that case you lose the trusted part, but
gain the extension installation aspect of TLE.</p>
 
 
<p>There are a few things included in TLE to make sure that TLE can be
installed safely. It is an opt-in feature. We do have a shared preload
library for pg_tle called “pg underscore TLE”, and you do need to have your
database super user install pg_le initially. This ensures that we’re
respecting your security boundary, If you’re going to use trusted language
extensions, you do have an explicit opt-in to using it.</p>
 
 David Wheeler (he/him) in chat: <a href="https://github.com/aws/pg_tle">https://github.com/aws/pg_tle</a> 
 
 
 
<p>After that, an app developer can create their own trusted language
extension.</p>
 
 
<p>Here’s a simple example from the TlE announcement with two functions and
packaged into an extension you can install. You can give it a name like
any Postgres extension; this one is called “tle_test”. The code looks like
the SQL file in any extension. And it’s effectively packaged up like an
extension using the <code>pgtle.install_extension</code> command. If you go to the
pg_le GitHub project you can see the the different interface points.</p>
 
 
<p>Once it’s installed you can use <code>CREATE EXTENSION</code> like any other
extension: it follows all the usual Postgres semantics: extension
installation, uninstallation, software life cycle management. pg_tle has
its own interface for that functionality, bu once you’ve installed it,
managing the extension is just like managing any other Postgres extension,
and follows those conventions.</p>
 
 
<p>Effectively TLE is offering, loosely, a packaging mechanism (I think
packaging has a lot more connotations): it’s a grouping mechanism for
your code. One of the parts that I always found most useful in
pg_tle was this part, effectively versioning my store procedures.</p>
 
 
<p>When I talked about the example where I was putting business logic into
the database, one part I would usually mess up is: what version of my
stored procedures was running in a given database. Particularly if you
have hundreds or thousands of databases that you’re managing, that can be a
challenge.</p>
 
 
<p>Now I had far fewer databases I was managing, I was more dealing with our
developer environments: staging and production. But I was managing the
store procedures within our migration scripts — which is totally fine,
because if I know what version of the migration that I ran then I would
know what version of the stored procedures are on that database. Kind of.
Sort of. Maybe. You know: unless someone manually modified it — in which
case shame on me for giving access to the database. But there basically
could be some gaps in knowing what version of a stored procedure was on a
particular server.</p>
 
 
<p>With pg_le we can significantly reduce the risk of that problem because we
have a way to version our store procedures, and be able to know exactly
what we’re running at any given time, and create a consistent packaging
mechanism wherever we’re running our code. And it goes beyond stored
procedures because there’s far more that you can can build with your code.</p>
 
 
<p>What else does TLE add? We discussed was the packaging mechanism, but a
lot of the power of Postgres extensions is the ability to use the
underlying Postgres internals. One of these types of internals is called a
“hook”.</p>
<p>Hooks are the Postgres feature that you’ve never heard of, that are not
well documented, and yet are the foundational part of many extensions.
Hooks are almost everywhere in Postgres. You particularly see a lot of
them during the query execution process. For example the process utility
hook which allows you to modify any utility command, anything that’s not a
direct SQL statement. There are all sorts of hooks: there are password
check hooks, client authentication hooks, hooks called around shared
memory allocation, hooks called at each step of the the execution phase.</p>
 
 
<p>Florents Tselai in chat: Hooks are almost undocumented indeed</p>
<p>The best resources I’ve found:</p>
 
 <a href="https://github.com/taminomara/psql-hooks">https://github.com/taminomara/psql-hooks</a> 
 and the standard: <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/images/e/e3/Hooks_in_postgresql.pdf">https://wiki.postgresql.org/images/e/e3/Hooks_in_postgresql.pdf</a> 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Hooks are very powerful; particularly enabling a lot of extensions adding
different semantic behavior to Postgres. We could probably do a whole
series of talks just on all the different ways you can extend Postgres. I
mean, that’s why David has organized the summit! But hooks are very simply
a powerful mechanism to define behavior and Postgres.</p>
 
 
<p>Because they’re so powerful, for the hooks that we expose in tle we
make sure that there is a super user opt-in. Remember, an unprivileged user can define
this behavior but you do need someone with privilege
to be able to enable something like a hook.</p>
 
 
<p>For example, a password check hook probably means that you have the
ability to evaluate a plain text password that’s coming through. Now on
that topic we can have a very long debate, but let’s save that for
Vancouver. But with this hook, you do have the ability to do password
checks, so you want to make sure that, when you enable a function that
calling a password check hook that there’s a certain level of privilege to
that function. Or you you know you want to make sure you do your
appropriate evaluation to make sure that you trust that function.</p>
 
 
<p>In addition to that check, there’s an additional check from the pg_tle
admin role that requires someone with administrative privileges over your
TLE to register that hook. The concept of “TLE features” are  the way to
map hooks into the TLE. We’ve been building it up
since we launched TLE by adding a few hooks. There’s both the check
password hook and the client authentication hook.</p>
 
 
<p>There’s also the ability to register custom data types — which is pretty
cool, because data types are what attracted me to Postgres when I was an
app developer: “Oh! There are all these data types! I can do all these
rich comparisons against an index? Cool! Oh wait, you can even add custom
data types? That’s even cooler!”</p>
 
 
<p>TLE allows you to create the base data type, so you can really expand
the data types that you’re able to add. This is what TLE features does: it
enables that safe mapping  between trusted language code and the Postgres
C internals.</p>
 
 
<p>In order to create a hook, you need to match the hook function definition.
The TLE documentation documents how to create it appropriately, but it
doesn’t need all the parameters that you would find in the
hook function.</p>
 
 
<p>In this check password hook — I call this the “delay check password
test”, meaning you’re probably trying to avoid someone trying to guess
your password repeatedly, and if they keep failing so what, because
they’re not going to brute force it anyway. There are actually more
practical examples of check password hooks. But what’s cool is that you
can define everything around the your hook behavior from within the hook
function and then it acts as if you wrote a C-based hook! You just happen
to write it in a in a trusted language.</p>
 
 
<p>Hooks do execute with elevated privileges, particularly around
authentication you want to be very careful. So there are some safeguards
built into TLE to make sure that you only enable hooks when you want to.</p>
 
 
<p>Last but not least: choosing a trusted language. I know this group is more
focused on extension building, but I do want to talk about what an app
developer goes through when choosing a
trusted language.</p>
 
 
<p>Because everything has its trade-offs to consider. The Golden Rule (I
actually took this from Jim Mlodgensky) is: when in doubt use PL/pgSQL,
because it does have a lot of access to context that’s already available
in Postgres. What’s interesting about this is that what we see today is
based on PL/SQL. PL/pgSQL was developed to try to make it simpler to
migrate from Oracle, but at the same time to provide a lot of rich
functionality around Postgres.</p>
 
 
<p>As someone much more familiar with Ruby and Python, I can tell you that
PL/pgSQL can be a little bit quirky. But it is very well documented, and
it can solve all the problems that you need to in Postgres. And it already
has a lot of very simple ways to directly access your data from Postgres.
Certainly an easy choice to go with.</p>
 
 
<p>But wait, there’s more!</p>
 
 
<p>like PL/v8, writing JavaScript in your database, this is really cool! I
remember when it came out and how mind-blowing it was, in particular for
JSON processing. PL/v8 is awesome. PL/v8 came out right around the same
time as the document database! So you kind of had perfect storm of being
able to process JSON and write it in JavaScript — both within your
Postgres database and it could be quite powerful.</p>
 
 
<p>Another really cool feature of PL/v8 is the ability to directly call
another function or another PL/v8 function from within PL/v8, and not
have to go through Postgres function processing, which adds a lot of
additional overhead.</p>
 
 
<p>And now the one that’s all abuzz right now: PL/Rust. Being able to write
and execute Rust code within Postgres. This is pretty cool, because Rust
is a compiled language! There’s a trusted way to run PL/Rust within
Postgres. There are a few techniques to do it. First, whenever you’re
running Rust on your server, to make sure that you’re guarding against
breakouts.</p>
 
 
<p>There is a library, I believe it called postgres FTD, that effectively
compiles out some of the less dressed parts of Rust, such as unsafe
function calls. But you can still get everything that you want in PL/Rust
today: you get the Rust standard Library, the ability to run crates —
and you do want to evaluate crates to make sure that you’re comfortable
running them in your environment. But then you get this compiled language
that is CPU efficient, memory efficient, and memory safe. (Well, a lot of
Rust is memory safe) It’s pretty cool!</p>
 
 Steven Miller in chat: In PL/Rust, does it run the compilation when
the function is created? Then if there is a compiler issue it just
shows up right there? 
 
 
 
<p>I wrote a blog post last year that compared some different function calls
between PL/pgSQL, PL/v8, and PL/Rust. First I was doing some array
processing, and you could see that the Pl/Rust calls were very comparable
to the C calls. And then there’s some additional Vector processing, given
that I’ve been obsessing on vectors for the past 14 months. Seeing rust
actually win against PL/pgSQL and PL/v8 (I don’t remember the numbers off
the top of my head I can look up that blog as soon as I switch windows).
Pretty cool!</p>
 
 
<p>This brings us in some ways to the best of all worlds, because I can take
an extension that normally I would write in C, particularly because I’m
focused on performance, I can write it in PL/Rust, package it as a trusted
language extension, and run it anywhere that TLE and PL/Rust are
supported. Again, that is very powerful, because suddenly I have what I
hope is the best of all worlds: I have this portability, I don’t have to
worry as much about major version upgrades because pg_le is acting as that
abstraction layer between the Postgres C code and the application code
that I’m writing.</p>
 
 
<p>Jeremy S in chat: Versioning of stored procedures is a very
interesting use case</p>
 
 
<p>Darren Baldwin in chat: Agreed! Moving stuff to the database layer
seems to be something very foreign and “scary” to most app devs I’ve
talked to</p>
 
 
<p>Anup Sharma in chat: Is TLE a requirement for any PostgreSQL
extension, or is it dependent?</p>
 
 
<p>Steven Miller in chat: So during a major version upgrade, the
function declaration stays the same, so that’s why your application
doesn’t need to change with respect to the extensions during a major
version upgrade. And at some point during the migration, you create
the function again, which recompiles. So it all works the same! That’s
great</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Last slide, then I’m certainly looking forward to discussion. pg_tle is
open source, and it’s open source for a lot of reasons. A lot of it is
because we want to make sure that trusted language extension are as
portable as possible. But in some ways the ideas behind TLE are not
original. If you look at other databases there is this notion of, let’s
call it inline extensions, or inline SQL, ou call them modules, you call
them packages. But the idea is that I can take reusable chunks of code,
package them together, and have them run anywhere. It doesn’t matter where
the database is located or hosted.</p>
 
 
<p>This is something that I personally want to work with folks on figuring
out how we can make this possible in Postgres. Because even in Postgres
this is not an original idea. Dimitri Fontaine was talking about this as
far back as 2012 in terms of his vision of where of the extension
framework was going.</p>
 
 
<p>What I’m looking forward to about this Extension Summit — and hopefully
and hopefully I’m not in conflicting meetings while it’s going on — is
talking about how we can allow app developers to leverage all the great
parts of Postgres around function writing, function building, and
ultimately packaging these functions, and making it simple simpler for
them to be able to move it wherever their applications are running.</p>
 
 
<p>So it is open source, open to feedback, under active development, continue
to add more features to support Postgres. Iltimately we want to hear
what’ll make it easier for extension writers to be able to use TLE, both
as a packaging mechanism and as a as a development mechanism.</p>
 
 
<p>So with that uh I that is the end of my slides and happy to uh get into a
discussion about this.</p>
 
 
 Discussion 
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): Awesome, thank you Jonathan. there was one
question about PL/Rust in the comments. Stephen asks whether it compiles
when you create the function, so if there are compiler issues they they
show up there.</p>
 
 
<p>Jonathan Katz: Correct It compiles when you create the function and that’s
where you’ll get compile errors. I have definitely received my fair share
of those [chuckles]. There is a Discord. PL/Rust is developed principally
by the folks uh responsible for the pgrx project, the folks at ZomboDB,
and they were super helpful and debugging all of my really poor Rust code.</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): While while people are thinking about the
questions I’ll just jump in here. You mentioned using crates with PL/Rust.
How does that work with pg_le since they have to be loaded from somewhere?</p>
 
 
<p>Jonathan Katz: That’s a good question. I kind of call it shifting the
problem. TLE solves one problem in that you don’t need to necessarily have
everything installed on your on your local file system outside of pg_tle
itself. If you’re using PL/Rust and you need crates, you do need those
crates available either within your file system or within whatever package
management tools you’re using. So it shifts the problem. I think it’s
going to be a good discussion, about what we can do to help ensure that
there is a trusted way of loading those.</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): Yeah I wonder if they could be vendored and then
just included in the upload through the function call.</p>
<p>Anup Sharma asked asked if pg_tle s a requirement any extension or
is it dependent.</p>
 
 
<p>Jonathan Katz: It’s not requirement. This is a project that is making it
possible to write Postgres extensions in trusted languages. There ar
plenty of extension authors on this call who have written very, very, very
good extensions in C that do not use TLE.</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): You can use trusted languages to write extensions
without TLE as well. It’s just a way of getting it into the
database without access to the file system, right?</p>
 
 
<p>Jonathan Katz: Correct. I think I saw Keith here. pg_partman is PL/pgSQL.</p>
 
 
<p>Anup Sharma in chat: Understood. Thanks</p>
 
 
<p>Tobias Bussmann in chat: I think it is important not to confuse
Trusted Language Extensions TLE with “trusted extensions” which is a
feature of Postgres 13</p>
 
 
<p>Keith Fiske in chat: Pretty much all of it is. Just the background
worker isn’t</p>
 
 
<p>Jonathan Katz in chat: hat’s what I thought but didn’t want to
misspeak 🙂</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): Right Any other questions or comments or any
implications that you’re thinking about through for extension
distribution, extension packaging, extension development?</p>
 
 Steven Miller in chat: Is background worker the main thing that a
TLE could not do in comparison to traditional extensions? 
 
 
 
<p>Jason Petersen: The crates thing kind of raised my interest. I don’t know
if Python has this ability to bring in libraries, or if JavaScript has
those dependencies as well. But has there been any thought within pg_tle
for first classing the idea of having a local subdirectory or a local file
system layout for the “native” dependencies? I’m using “native” in quotes
here because it could be JavaScript, it could be Python, whatever of those
languages, so they could be installed in a way that’s not operating system
independent.</p>
<p>I know this is kind of a complex setup, but what I’m getting at is that a
lot of times you’ll see someone say “you need to install this package
which is called this and Red Hat or this on Mac or this on Debian — and
then you can install my extension. Has there been any push towards
solving that problem by having your TLE extensions load things from like a
a sort of Walled Garden that you set up or something? So it’s specific to
the database instead of the OS?</p>
 
 
<p>Jonathan Katz: That’s a good question. There has been thought around this.
I think this is going to be probably something that requires a thorough
discussion in Vancouver. Because if you look at the trusted languages that
exist in Postgres today, the definition of trusted language is: thou shall
not access the file system. But if you look at all these different
languages, they all have external dependencies in some in some way shape
or form. Through Perl there’s everything in CPAN; through
JavaScript there’s everything in npm. Let’s say installed the appropriate CPAN libs and npm libs within uh your database for everything I recall from playing with trusted PL/v8 and PL/Perl is
that you still can’t access those libraries. You can’t make the include or
the require call to get them.</p>
<p>Where PL/Rust is unique is that first off we just said,
“yes, you can use your Cargo crates here.” But I think that also requires
some more thinking in terms of like how we make that available,
if it’s OS specific, vendor specific, or if there’s
something universal that we can build that helps to make that
more of a trusted piece. Because I think at the end of the day, we
still want to give the administrative discretion in terms of what they
ultimately install.</p>
<p>With the trusted language extensions themselves, we’re able to say,
“here’s the post security boundary, we’re operating within that security
boundary.” As soon as we start introducing additional dependencies,
effectively that becomes a judgment call: are
those dependencies going to operate within that security boundary or not.
We need to be make sure that administrators still have the ability to
to make that choice.</p>
 
 
<p>I think there are some very good discussion topics around this,  not just
for something like PL/Rust but extension distribution in general I think
that is you know one of the I think that’ll be one of the key discussions
at the Extension Summit.</p>
 
 David Wheeler (he/him) in chat: What if the required
modules/packages/whatever were in a table. e.g. in Perl I do <code>use Foo::Bar</code> and it has a hook to load a record with the ID Foo::Bar from
a table 
 
 
 
<p>David G. Johnson: Has there been any thought to having the default version
of an extension tied to the version of PostgreSQL? Instead of it just
being 1.3 and, whether I’m on version 12 or 15, because 1.3 might not even
work on version 12 but it would work on version 15. The versioning of the
an extension and the versioning of PostgreSQL seem like they’re almost
too independent.</p>
 
 
<p>Jonathan Katz: So David, I think what you need to do is chastise the
extension developers to let them know they should be versioning
appropriately to to the the version of Postgres that they’re using.
[Chuckles]</p>
<p>There is a good point in there, though. There is a lot of freedom in terms
of how folks can build extensions. For example, just top of mind, pgvector
supports all the supported versions of Postgres. Version 0.7.0 is going to
be coming out soon so it’s able to say, “pgvector 0.7.0 works with these
versions.” Dumb. PG plan meanwhile maintains several back releases; I
think 1.6.0 is the latest release and it only supports Postgres 16. I
don’t believe it supports the earlier versions (I have to double check),
but there’s effectively things of that nature.</p>
<p>And then there aer all sorts of different things out there, like PostGIS
has its own life cycles. So there’s something good in that and maybe the
answer is that becomes part of the control file, saying what versions ov
Postgres an extension is compatible with. That way we’re not necessarily
doing something to break some environment. I’m just brainstorming on on
live TV.</p>
 
 
<p>David G. Johnson: The other day I open a but report on this. but
PostgreSQL dump and restore will dump it without the version that’s in the
source database, and when yoq restore it, it’s going to restore to
whatever the current version for the control file is even if you’re
upgrading to a different database. versus restoring it to whatever the
original version was. That dynamic just seemed problematic.</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): I think it’s less problematic for trusted language
extensions or extensions that have no C code in them, because pg_dump does
dump the extension, so you should be able to load it up. I assume base
backup and the others do the same thing.</p>
 
 
<p>David G. Johnson: I haven’t checked into that. It dumps <code>CREATE EXTENSION</code>
and then it dump any user tables that are marked by the extension. So
these code tables are marked as being user tables for TLE?</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): What do you mean by code tables?</p>
 
 
<p>Regina Obe: That’s a good point. For example my Tiger geocoder is all
PL/pgSQL, but it’s only the <code>CREATE EXTENSION</code> thing that’s named. So for
your TLE table, it would try to reload it from the original source,
wouldn’t it? In which case it would be the wrong version.</p>
 
 
<p>Jonathan Katz: We had to add some things into TLE to make sure it worked
appropriately with pg_dump. Like I know for a fact that if you dump and
load the extension it works it works fine. Of it doesn’t then there’s a
bug and we need to fix it.</p>
 
 
<p>David G. Johnson: Okay yeah I haven’t played with this. Literally this is
new to me for the most part. I found the whole fact that the control file
is not updated when you do <code>ALTER EXTENSION</code> to be, at least in my mind,
buggy.</p>
 
 
<p>Jonathan Katz: In the case of TLE, because it’s in theory major
version-agnostic. When I say “in theory,” it’s because we need to make
sure the TLE code in library itself is able to work with every major
version. But once that’s abstracted away the TLEs themselves can just be
dumped and reloaded into different versions of Postgres. I think we I we
have a TAP test for that, I have to double check. But major version
upgrades was something we 100% tested for</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): I assume it’d be easier with pg_tle since there’s
no need to make sure the extension is is installed on the file system of
the new server.</p>
 
 
<p>Jonathan Katz: Yep. if you look at the internals for pg_tle, effectively
the TLEs themselves are in a table. When you do a <code>CREATE EXTENSION</code> it
gets loaded from that particular table.</p>
 
 
<p>David G. Johnson: Right, and when you do a pg_dump you make suer that
table was dumped to the dump file.</p>
 
 
<p>Jonathan Katz: Yes. But this is a key thing that we we had to make sure
would does work: When loading in a pg_dump, a lot of the <code>CREATE EXTENSIONS</code> get called before the table. So we need to make sure that we
created the appropriate dependency so that we load the TLE data before
the <code>CREATE EXTENSION</code>. Or the <code>CREATE EXTENSION</code> for the TLE itself.</p>
 
 
<p>Jeremy S in chat, replying to “Is background worker the main…”:
doing a background worker today, I think requires working in C, and I
don’t think core PG exposes this yet. Maybe it could be possible to
create a way to register with a hook to a rust procedure or something,
but maybe a better way in many cases is using pg_cron</p>
 
 
<p>Jonathan Katz in chat: We can add support for BGWs via the TLE API;
it’s just not present currently.</p>
 
 
<p>nils in chat: Creative thinking, if a background worker doesn’t work
in TLE, how about create your UDF in tle and schedule with pg_cron 🤡</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): You mentioned in the comments that you think that
background workers could be added. How would that work?</p>
 
 
<p>Jonathan Katz: It would be similar to the the other things that we’ve
added, the data types and the hooks. It’s effectively creating the
interface between the C API and what we’d expose as part of the TLE API.
It’s similar to things like pgrx, where it’s binding to Postgres C API but
it’s exposing it through a Rust API. We do something similar with the TLE
API.</p>
 
 
<p>Steven Miller in chat: Thank you Jeremy. I like this idea to use
TLE, then depend on cron for a recurring function call</p>
 
 
<p>Steven Miller in chat: Ah yes Nils same idea 😄</p>
 
 
<p>Jason Petersen in chat: Thumbs up to nils about pgcron. If you need
a recurring BGW just write it in plpgsql and schedule it</p>
 
 
<p>nils in chat: Great hackers think alike</p>
 
 
<p>Jason Petersen in chat: (I know I do this)</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): That that makes sense. I just thought the
background workers were literally applications that are started when the
postmaster starts up shut down when the postmaster shuts down.</p>
 
 
<p>Jonathan Katz: But there’s dynamic background workers.</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): Oh, okay.</p>
 
 
<p>Jonathan Katz: That’s how a parallel query works.</p>
 
 Jeremy S in chat: Threading? 😰 
 
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): Gotcha, okay. Sorry my information’s out of date.
[chuckles]</p>
 
 
<p>Jonathan Katz: Well maybe one day we’ll have you know some some form of
threading, too. I don’t think like we’ll get a wholesale replacement with
threads, but I think there are certain areas where threads would help and
certain areas workers are the way to go/</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): Yeah, yeah that makes sense.</p>
 
 
<p>Jonathan Katz: Hot take!</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): What other questions do you have for about TLEs or
extensions more broadly and packaging in relation to TLEs?</p>
 
 
<p>David G. Johnson: Just a random thought: Have you thought about
incorporating foreign servers and pointing the TLE, instead of a local
database, point it to a master, company-wide foreign table?</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): Like a TLE registry?</p>
 
 
<p>David G. Johnson: Right, yeah something global would be nice. like okay we
hosted on PGXN at there’s a TLE registry. But because for a company who
wants maintain code internally between projects, and they want a shared
library, they can publish it on one server, send up a link to it over
foreign server, and then just point at that.</p>
 
 
<p>Jonathan Katz: Could be!</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): I mean you could just use foreign foreign tables
for that for the tables that TLE uses for its its registry, right?</p>
 
 
<p>David G. Johnson: That’s I’m thinking.</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): Yeah that’s a cute idea.</p>
 
 
<p>Jonathan Katz: I think that just to to go back a few more minutes. I think
you I was asked to talk about the vision. One one way to view extensions
is trying things out before they’re in core, or before they’re in
Postgres. The aspect that I would ultimately like to see in core someday
is the ability to do that’s called “inline modules.” There is a SQL
standard syntax, <code>CREATE MODULE</code>, that for this purpose. Some folks were
trying to see see if we could get it into, I believe, Postgres 15. There
was some push back on the design and it died on the vine for the time
being.</p>
<p>But I do think it’s something to consider because when I talk to folks,
whether it’s random Postgres users RDS customers, etc., and I go through
TLE, one of the things that really stands out is one of the things that we
had discussed here and I saw in the chat, which is this aspect: being able
to version your stored procedures. This is in part what modules aims to
solve. One is just having a SQL interface to load all these things and
group it together. But then once you have that grouping you have the
ability to version it. This is the part that’s very powerful. As soon as I
saw this I was like, “man I could have used that that would have saved me
like hours of debugging code in production.” Mot saying that I was ever
sloppy and you know in random store procedures in my production database!</p>
 
 David Wheeler (he/him) in chat: I see CREATE MODULE in the db2 docs. 
 
 
 
<p>Jonathan Katz: But that’s kind of the vision. The fact that Postgres is
extensible has led to this very widely adopted database. But I think there
are things that we can also learn in our extensions and bring back
upstream. There are certainly reasons why they we developing things in
extensions! Like pgvector is an example of that, where we talked about it
at PGCon last year. And part of the thought of not trying to add a vector
data type to Postgres was, first, to make sure we could settle on what the
the binary format would be; and once that’s solidified, then we could add
it.</p>
<p>But I had an aside with Tom [Lane] where we talked about the fact that
this is something we need to move fast on, the vector space is moving very
quickly, extensions are a way to be able to move quickly when something
like Postgres moves more deliberately.</p>
<p>This is in
some ways where TLE is, our way to be able to see what kind of interface
makes sense for being able to do inline extension loading
and ultimately how we want that to look in core.</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): Can you create data types with a binary
representation in TLE?</p>
 
 
<p>Jonathan Katz: Yes as of (I want to say) the the 1.3 release. I have to
double check the version. The way we’re able to do it safely is that it
actually leverages the BYTEA type. When you create that representation it
stores it as a BYTEA. What you get for free today is that, if you create
your equality/inequality operators, you can use a b-tree look up on these
data types.</p>
<p>So there’s a “dot dot dot” there. If we wanted to be able to use like GIST
in GIN and build data types for our other index interfaces, there’s more
work to be done. That would require a TLE interface. I spent a lot of time
playing with GIST and GIN, and the interface calls themselves involve
pointers. So that will require some thought yeah.</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): I assume it’s a similar issue for Rust data types
that are basically just serde-serialized.</p>
 
 
<p>Jonathan Katz: Yeah we can at least like store things in BYTEA, and that’s
half the battle. It allows us to do a safe representation on disk as
opposed just “here’s some random binary; good luck and don’t crash the
database!”</p>
 
 
<p>Jason Petersen in chat: I also wondered about the function interface
for things like storage features (table access methods).</p>
<p>I assume they’re similarly hairy</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): Any other last minute questions?</p>
 
 
<p>Jonathan Katz: Table access methods. Yes table access methods are very
hairy as are index access methods. I spent a lot of time the past 14
months looking at the index access method interface, which has a lot of
brilliance in it, and certainly some more areas to develop. But it’s
amazing! The fact that we can implement vector
indexes and get all the best parts of Postgres is a phenomenal
advantage.</p>
 
 
<p>Jeremy S: One last question. We’re leading up to Vancouver and we’re going
to be starting to think about  some of the topics that we want to make
sure to talk about at the Summit. I think you mentioned one earlier (I
should have written it down), but any final thoughts about topics that we
should make sure to discuss?</p>
 
 
<p>Jonathan Katz: Just in general or TLE specific?</p>
 
 
<p>Jeremy S: Both. I mean for sure TLE-specific, but also just generally
related to extensions</p>
 
 
<p>Jonathan Katz: My TLE-specific one dovetails into the general one. The
first one is: is there ultimately a path forward to having some kind of
inline extension management mechanism in core Postgres. That’s the top,
part one, I spent the past five minutes talking about that.</p>
<p>But I think the big thing, and why we’re all here today, is how do we make
it easier for developers to install extensions, manage extensions, etc. I
think the notion of package management thanks to the work of Andres
finding the backdoor to xz also shines a new light, because there’s a huge
security component to this. I remember, David, some of our earlier chats
around this. I think you know —- again, being ap-developer sympathetic
— I definitely want to see ways to make it easier to be able to load
extensions.</p>
<p>Having spend spent a lot of time on the other side, the first thing that
comes to mind is security. How do we create a protocol for managing the
extension ecosystem that also allows folks to opt into it and apply their
own security or operational or whatever the requirements are on top of it.
That’s the thing that’s most top of mind. I don’t expect to have like a
full resolution from the Extension Summit on it, but at least the start of
it. What is ultimately that universal packaging distribution protocol for
Postgres extensions that we can all agree on?</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): Thank you so much! Before we go I just wanted to
tee up that in two weeks Yuri Rashkovskii is going to talk about his idea
for universally buildable extensions: dev to prod. That’ll be on May 1st
at noon Eastern and 4pm UTC. Thank you everybody for coming.</p>

  The v1.6.0 release of the pgxn-tools Docker image adds a new command to
efficiently build and test pgrx extensions on a wide variety of Postgres
versions.

<p>Yesterday I released v1.6.0 of the <a href="https://github.com/pgxn/docker-pgxn-tools/">pgxn/pgxn-tools Docker image</a> with a new
command: <a href="https://github.com/pgxn/docker-pgxn-tools?tab=readme-ov-file#pgrx-build-test"><code>pgrx-build-test</code></a> works much like the existing <a href="https://github.com/pgxn/docker-pgxn-tools?tab=readme-ov-file#pg-build-test"><code>pg-build-test</code></a>
utility for <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/extend-pgxs.html">PGXS</a> extensions, but for <a href="https://github.com/pgcentralfoundation/pgrx">pgrx</a> extensions. Here’s an example
<a href="https://github.com/tembo-io/pg-jsonschema-boon/blob/ea64888/.github/workflows/lint-and-test.yml">from pg-jsonschema-boon</a>, a pgrx extension I’ve been working on:</p>
  <code>name: 🧪 Test
on:
  push:
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container: pgxn/pgxn-tools
    strategy:
      matrix:
        pg: [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]
    name: 🐘 Postgres ${{ matrix.pg }}
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Start PostgreSQL ${{ matrix.pg }}
        run: pg-start ${{ matrix.pg }}
      - name: Setup Rust Cache
        uses: Swatinem/rust-cache@v2
      - name: Test on PostgreSQL ${{ matrix.pg }}
        run: pgrx-build-test
</code>  <p>The format is the same as for <code>pg-build-test</code>, starting with installing a
specific version of Postgres from the <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Apt">Postgres Apt repository</a> (supporting
versions 8.2 – 17). It then adds the <a href="https://github.com/Swatinem/rust-cache">Swatinem/rust-cache</a> action to speed up
Rust builds by caching dependencies, and then simply calls <code>pgrx-build-test</code>
instead of <code>pg-build-test</code>. Here’s what it does:</p>
 
 Extracts the pgrx version from the <code>Cargo.toml</code> file and installs it
(requires v0.11.4 or higher) 
 Initializes pgrx to use the Postgres installed by <code>pg-start</code> 
 Builds the extension with <code>cargo pgrx package</code> 
 Tests the extension with <code>cargo pgrx test</code> 
 Installs the extension with <code>cargo pgrx install</code> 
 Checks for a <code>Makefile</code> with <code>installcheck</code> configured and, if it exists,
runs <code>make installcheck</code> 
 
<p>This last step allows one to include <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/extend-pgxs.html">PGXS</a>-style <code>pg_regress</code> tests in
addition to Rust/pgrx tests, as pg-jsonschema-boon does. Here’s a <a href="https://github.com/tembo-io/pg-jsonschema-boon/actions/runs/8809394356">successful
run</a>.</p>
<p>Special thanks to Eric Ridge and @Jubilee for all the help and improvements in
<a href="https://github.com/pgcentralfoundation/pgrx/releases/tag/v0.11.4">pgrx v0.11.4</a> that enable this to work transparently.</p>
 pgrx Release Pattern 
<p>The pattern for releasing a prgx extension on PGXN is the same as before,
although you may want to generate the <code>META.json</code> file from a template. For
example, the <a href="https://github.com/tembo-io/pg-jsonschema-boon/blob/ea64888/Makefile">pg-jsonschema-boon Makefile</a> creates <code>META.json</code> from
<code>META.json.in</code> by reading the version from <code>Cargo.toml</code> and replacing
<code>@CARGO_VERSION@</code>, like so:</p>
  <code>DISTVERSION = $(shell perl -nE '/^version\s*=\s*"([^"]+)/ &amp;&amp; do { say $$1; exit }' Cargo.toml)

META.json: META.json.in Cargo.toml
	@sed "s/@CARGO_VERSION@/$(DISTVERSION)/g" $&lt; &gt; $@
</code>  <p>The release workflow uses it like so:</p>
  <code>name: 🚀 Release on PGXN
on:
  push:
    # Release on semantic version tag.
    tags: ['v[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+']
jobs:
  release:
    name: 🚀 Release on PGXN
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container: pgxn/pgxn-tools
    env:
      PGXN_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.PGXN_USERNAME }}
      PGXN_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.PGXN_PASSWORD }}
    steps:
    - name: Check out the repo
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Bundle the Release
      env: { GIT_BUNDLE_OPTS: --add-file META.json }
      run: make META.json &amp;&amp; pgxn-bundle
    - name: Release on PGXN
      run: pgxn-release
</code>  <p>Note the “Bundle the Release” step, which first calls <code>make META.json</code> to
generate the dated file, and tells <code>pgxn-bundle</code> to add the <code>META.json</code>
via the <code>GIT_BUNDLE_OPTS</code> environment variable. The project also excludes
the <code>META.json.in</code> file from the bundle in <a href="https://github.com/tembo-io/pg-jsonschema-boon/blob/ea64888/.gitattributes">its <code>.gitattributes</code></a> file,
and excludes <code>META.json</code> from the project repository in <a href="https://github.com/tembo-io/pg-jsonschema-boon/blob/ea64888/.gitignore">its <code>.gigignore</code></a> file.</p>
<p>Looking forward to seeing all your pgrx projects on <a href="https://pgxn.org/">PGXN</a>!</p>

			 PGXN Future Architecture 
			<p>High-level diagram of the six logical services making up the proposed future
extension distribution architecture. The Root Registry sits at the center,
providing APIs for the other services to consume for their own use cases.
Trusted instances of those services submit additional data about extensions
via the Interactions service to enhance and enrich the service to better
inform and delight users.</p>
		
	

         
<p>Over on the <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/">Postgres Wiki</a> I’ve published a new document for the <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PGXN_v2">PGXN v2</a>
project: <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PGXN_v2/Architecture">PGXN v2 Architecture</a>. It has diagrams, such as the one above! From
the introduction:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This document outlines the project to build extension distribution,
discovery, and packaging tools and services to power the growth,
accessability, and utility of the Postgres extension ecosystem. Taking the
overall Postgres community as its audience, it defines the services to be
provided and the architecture to run them, as well as the strategic vision
to guide project planning and decision-making.</p>
<p>With the goal to think strategically and plan pragmatically, this document
describes the former to enable the latter. As such, it is necessarily
high-level; details, scoping, and planning will be surfaced in more
project-focused documents.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that this document outlines an ambitious, long-term strategy.
If you’re thinking that there’s too much here, that we’er over-thinking and
over-designing the system, rest assured that project execution will be
fundamentally incremental and pragmatic. This document is the guiding light
for the project, and subject to change as development proceeds and new
wrinkles arise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For those of you interested in the future of Postgres extension distribution,
please give it a read! I expect it to guide the planning and implementation of
the the new services and tools in the coming year. Please do consider it a
living document, however; it’s likely to need updates as new issues and
patterns emerge. Log in and hit the “watch” tab to stay in the loop for those
changes or the “discussion” tab to leave feedback.</p>
<p>I’ve also moved the <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/02/pgxn-architecture/" title="Presentation: Introduction to the PGXN Architecture">previously-mentioned</a> document <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Extension_Ecosystem:_Jobs_and_Tools">Extension Ecosystem: Jobs

for all PGXN-related content. It also includes another new document, <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PGXN_v2/Service_Disposition">Service
Disposition</a>, which describes itself as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A summary of the ambitiously-envisioned future PGXN services and
architecture, followed by an examination of existing services and how they
will gradually be refactored or replaced for the updated platform.</p>

<p>Before we start: AI tooling for software development feels like it has hit "peak hype" across mainstream media. We would like to do a "reality check" and find out how engineers and teams are using these tools (and which tools/use cases are genuinely efficient). Please <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfVMJZNH52X7x2uC1qsMiVC-atjzZOFIc8fySCBwqro--fU9Q/viewform?usp=sf_link">help us by filling out this survey.</a> </p><p><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfVMJZNH52X7x2uC1qsMiVC-atjzZOFIc8fySCBwqro--fU9Q/viewform?usp=sf_link">Fill out the survey on AI tools</a></p><p>We will share the full report with all of you who share detailed insights. Thanks for your help!</p>   <p>‘Real-world engineering challenges’ is <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/t/real-world-engineering-challenges">a series</a> in which we interpret interesting software engineering or engineering management case studies from tech companies.</p><p><a href="https://bsky.app/">Bluesky</a> is known as a Twitter-alternative. It launched two years ago, with an invite-only beta launch last year. It’s already grown to an impressive 5.5 million registered users. Interestingly for software engineers, Bluesky is also a fascinating engineering project unlike any other mainstream social network. Martin Kleppman, author of the Designing Data Intensive Applications book, is involved as a technical advisor, and has <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03239.pdf">published a paper</a> outlining the novel approaches Bluesky has taken.</p><p>The biggest differences between Bluesky and other large social networks:</p>  <p>Decentralized. Bluesky is a “decentralized social network,” meaning anyone can run their own servers. If Bluesky’s core team turned off all services today, the network would keep functioning. As such, Bluesky offers a way for users to truly own their data and services.</p>  <p>Open source. Nearly everything about Bluesky builds is open source, and <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social">hosted on GitHub.</a></p>  <p>Rapid growth. The product went from zero to 5 million users in around 12 months after announcing an invite-only beta.</p>  <p>Small team. Bluesky was built with a small team of 3 engineers during the first year, and with 12 software engineers at the time of publication.</p>  <p>Other social networks have achieved some of these things; such as Mastodon allowing users to own their data and identity, and Meta achieving eye-catching growth by getting <a href="http://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/building-the-threads-app">100 million users in just a week</a>. Still, only Bluesky has pulled off them all.</p><p>Today, we dive into how Bluesky is built, sitting down with its two founding engineers: <a href="https://dholms.github.io/">Daniel Holmgren</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/pfrazee.com">Paul Frazee</a>. They take us through:</p>  <p>Development timeline. How Bluesky went from a vague idea with few specific details, to a decentralized social network with millions of users.</p>  <p>Experimentation phase. A team of 2-3 engineers prototyped for 9 months, established the development principles, and laid the groundwork for the protocol and app.</p>  <p>v1 architecture. An overview of Bluesky’s architecture at the launch of its public beta offering. This was a Postgres database built on top of AWS, and used Pulumi.</p>  <p>v2 architecture. Extending Bluesky to support “federation,” allowing users to run their own Bluesky instances.</p>  <p>Scaling the database layer. PostgreSQL didn’t scale with the site’s growth, so it was time to migrate. The team chose ScyllaDB and SQLite.</p>  <p>Infra stack: from AWS to on-prem. AWS was becoming too costly, so Bluesky moved over to dedicated data centers and bare-metal machines.</p>  <p>Reality of building a social network. Typical firefighting issues, Elon Musk, and outages not being “life-or-death” crises.</p>   1. Development timeline <p>Bluesky has been in development for just over 2 years, and has been publicly available for around 12 months. Here’s the timeline:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F359800b3-7bde-421b-9645-fbed2bf32a14_1496x1032.png">    </a>Bluesky’s development timeline and major milestones <p>Adding in the three phases we’ll discuss below:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F75476852-faa7-420b-98be-92f82f5d29b6_1600x1003.png">    </a>Bluesky’s development, split into three phases  Phase 1: Experimentation <p>The first 10 months of the project between January and October 2022 were all about exploration, and the team started to work fully in the open after 4 months. The first project the team open sourced was <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/5-4-2022-working-in-public">Authenticated Data Experiment</a> (ADX), an experimental personal data server and a command-line client, accompanied by a network architecture overview.</p><p>In April 2022, heavy Twitter user, Elon Musk, raised the prospect of potentially acquiring the site, which created interest in alternatives to the bird app, as any major change in a market-leading social network does.</p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/social-app/commits/main/?since=2022-06-08&amp;until=2022-09-01&amp;after=3abf302b0b189c50acf11489bf60bdaeb187b722+34">first commit</a> for the Bluesky mobile app was made in June 2022, and Paul Frazee worked on it. It started as a proof-of-concept to validate that the protocol worked correctly, and to aid protocol development via real-world use. Conventional wisdom says that prototypes are thrown away after serving their purpose.&nbsp;</p><p>However, in this case this mobile app that a single person had built, became the production app, following the unforeseen spike of interest in it caused by takeover news at Twitter. This is a good reminder that real world events can push conventional wisdom out of the window!</p><p>In October 2022, the team announced the Authenticated Transfer Protocol (AT Protocol) and the app’s waitlist, just a few days after news that Elon Musk was to acquire Twitter. This led many tweeters to seek alternative social networks, and drove a major signup spike for Bluesky’s private beta. This development put pressure on the Bluesky team to seize the unexpected opportunity by getting the protocol and app ready for beta users. See <a href="https://atproto.com/">details on the AT Protocol.</a></p> Phase 2: invite-only launch and the first 1M users <p>In October 2022, Bluesky consisted solely of Jay Graber CEO, and two software engineers; Daniel and Paul. Engineer #3, Devin, joined the same month. Announcing the AT Protocol and waitlist generated some media buzz and Bluesky attracted more interest during this period.</p><p>In March 2023, the company was confident that the protocol and mobile app were stable enough to invite more users by sending invites.</p><p>“Blocking” was implemented in a single night. After the app opened up to more users, there was an influx of offensive posts and of users verbally harassing other accounts. This made it clear that implementing blocks to restrict individual accounts from viewing and commenting on a user’s posts, was urgently-needed functionality.</p><p>The three earliest developers – Paul, Devin and Daniel – jumped on a call, then got to work. In the community, developers saw the pull requests (PRs) on this feature appear on GitHub, and started to point out bugs, and cheer on the rapid implementation. They wrapped it up and launched the feature by the end of the same day. To date, this is the most rapidly-built feature, and is still used across the protocol and the app!</p><p>In June 2023, Bluesky <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/6-02-2023-beta-update">passed</a> the 100,000-users milestone when the team numbered 6 developers, who’d shipped features like custom feeds, blocking and muting, moderation controls, and custom domains. A web application built on React Native was also in production.</p><p>In September 2023, Bluesky passed 1 million users – a 900,000 increase in just 3 months!</p> Phase 3: Preparing for public launch <p>In the 6 months following the 1 million-user milestone, the focus was on preparing to open up Bluesky to the public with no waitlist or throttling of invites.</p><p>Federation (internal.) To prepare for “proper” federation, the team made architecture changes to enable internal federation of Bluesky servers.&nbsp;</p><p>Federation is a key concept in distributed networks. It means a group of nodes can send messages to one another. For Bluesky, it meant that – eventually – users should be able to run their own PDS instances that host their own user information (and user information of users on that server.) And the Bluesky network operates seamlessly with this distributed backend.</p><p>A new logo and a reference to Twitter. The team prepared a new logo for launch, and announced it in December 2023:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22a04102-e99d-456b-8275-4355bc5701f0_1600x838.png">    </a>The old and new logo <p>The butterfly logo is intended as a symbol of freedom and change. Existing centralized social media platforms – like X (formerly Twitter,) Instagram, TikTok, and Youtube – are platforms that want to lock users into their website and apps. Bluesky, on the other hand, offers its protocol, but doesn’t dictate which apps or websites people use. It doesn’t even want to dictate the hosting of content:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa98a6f2-d213-4c67-a355-51c7c1ce3a29_1600x1045.png">    </a>The final slide of Jay Graber’s presentation for Twitter about the vision for Bluesky. It was Twitter that granted Bluesky its initial $13M funding in 2021 – partially based on this vision. The image visualizes the blue bird freed from a closed platform into Bluesky’s open ecosystem. Source: <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/12-21-2023-butterfly">Bluesky</a> <p>Let’s dive into each phase of the building process.</p> 2. Experimentation phase <p>During Bluesky’s first 9 months (January-September 2022) two software engineers built the protocol and apps – Daniel Holmgren and Paul Frazee – and Jay the CEO signed off design decisions. The first couple of months were about experimenting and tech “spiking,” which means timeboxing the time and effort spent building and trying out ideas. Here’s Paul:</p><blockquote><p>“We would greenfield for a period, then attack what we had just created to see if it holds up. We gave the existing technologies a really close look; if we didn’t see meaningful improvements from the existing protocols, then we decided we’d use what was already out there.”</p></blockquote><p>When the direction wasn’t clear, the team kept trying out new approaches, says Daniel:</p><blockquote><p>“We set out to use as many existing specs as we could. We spent a lot of time early on investigating things like Activity Pub and seriously trying to figure out how we could make it work, and realizing that it didn't really work for our use case.”</p></blockquote> Development principles <p>The still-small team set up principles to ensure continuous progress:</p>  <p>No backward steps. Ease of use, scale, and feature developer experience, can not be worse than existing social networks’.</p>  <p>Unify app development with protocol development. Never make tech decisions in isolation from practical use cases.</p>  <p>Don’t be precious! If an idea or design doesn’t work, just throw it out!</p>   Approach to building a new, novel decentralized protocol <p>The team prioritized flexible design choices in order to not lock themselves into a technology, until they knew exactly what they were building. Not coupling the data layer too closely with Postgres is an example of this. See below.</p><p>Building for flexibility, not scalability, was deliberate. The idea was to swap this approach to prioritize scale once everyone knew exactly what to build. The knowledge that decisions are hard to undo made the team’s own decision-making more thorough, Daniel reflects:</p><blockquote><p>“The most difficult part of building Bluesky has been the constant awareness that small decisions you make may be locked in for years and have ripple effects. In a decentralized environment, these can be difficult to unwind. It puts a lot of weight on every decision, and we have to double and triple check choices that we make so that we hopefully don’t regret them.”&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Inventing new approaches was never a goal. The original idea was to take a protocol or technology off the shelf, and push it as far as possible to reveal a requirement that didn’t quite fit. For example, <a href="https://atproto.com/guides/lexicon">Lexicon</a> – the schema used to define remote procedure call (RPC) methods and record types – started out as JSON schemas. The team tried hard to keep it lightweight, and stuck to JSON schemas. But they ended up bending over backwards to make it work. In the end, the team decided to fork off from JSON schemas and added features to it, which is how Lexicon was born.</p><p>Bluesky gets criticism for inventing new approaches which are non-standard across decentralized networks. Paul explains it like this:</p><blockquote><p>“We never set out to live the ‘not invented here’ (NIH) syndrome. I don’t think anyone building something new has this goal. In the end, it just naturally evolved in this direction.</p><p>No one had done a high-scale decentralized social network before this! If someone had, we probably wouldn’t have needed to invent as many things.”</p></blockquote><p>Bluesky takes inspiration from existing web technologies. As Daniel puts it:</p><blockquote><p>“The AT Protocol is a pretty typical JSON API collection over HTTP. The architecture of Bluesky looks very similar to a traditional social media data center turned inside out. The firehose API looks a lot like Kafka – and we’re probably going to shard it in a similar way.”</p></blockquote> 3. v1 architecture: not really scalable and not federated – yet  Infrastructure choices <p>PostgreSQL was the team’s database of choice when starting development. Postgres is often called the “Swiss Army knife of databases” because it’s speedy for development, great for prototyping, with a vast number of extensions. One drawback is that Postgres is a single bottleneck in the system, which can cause issues when scaling to handle massive loads that never materialize for most projects.</p><p>For the team, using Postgres worked really well while they were unsure exactly what they were building, or how they would query things. Paul’s summary of the choice to use Postgres:</p><blockquote><p>“You start with a giant Postgres database and see how far that can take you, so that you can move quickly early on.”</p></blockquote><p>AWS infrastructure was what the team started with because it’s quick to set up and easy to use, says Daniel:</p><blockquote><p>“We were running everything out of AWS, and that is great because you can just spin up new VMs very easily, and spin up new stacks and services easily.”</p></blockquote><p>The first infra hire at Bluesky, Jake Gold, iterated on the AWS setup:</p><blockquote><p>“The basic idea we have right now is we’re using AWS, we have auto-scaling groups, and those auto-scaling groups are just <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">EC2</a> instances running Docker Community Edition (CE) for the runtime and for containers. And then we have a load balancer in front and a Postgres multi-availability zone instance in the back on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/">Relational Database Service</a> (RDS). It’s a really simple setup.”</p></blockquote><p>To facilitate deployments on AWS, the team used infrastructure-as-code service, <a href="https://www.pulumi.com/">Pulumi</a>.</p><p>Modularizing the architecture for an open network was an effort the team kicked off early. The goal of modularization was to spin out parts of the network which users could host themselves. Daniel says:</p><blockquote><p>“Our early insight was that we should give developers building on top of Bluesky the ability to focus on the parts of the network that they want to focus on. This is the microservices part.</p><p>An external developer building a feed should not need to index every “like” in the network. Someone self-hosting their own account should not need to consume thousands of posts to create a timeline. You can split the network into specific roles and have them work in concert.”</p></blockquote> Personal Data Server <p>At first, the architecture of Bluesky consisted of one centralized server, the PDS (Personal Data Server.)</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d0890b3-44a5-4faf-8c49-adc1cc2e9a8d_1234x606.png">    </a>The Bluesky backend in March 2023 <p>The strategy was to split this centralized service into smaller parts and allow for federation, eventually.</p><p>Bluesky being a federated network means individual users can run their own “Bluesky instance” and curate their own network.</p> The feed generator  <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22ba7f05-e56f-4d34-af21-99741598f25d_1382x1026.png">    </a>The backend in May 2023, after the feed generator was moved into its own component <p>In May 2023, the Bluesky team moved the feed generator to its own role. This service allows any developer to create a custom algorithm, and choose one to use. Developers can <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/feed-generator">spin up a new Feed Generator service</a> and make it discoverable to the Bluesky network, to add a new algorithm. Bluesky also allows users to choose from several predefined algorithms.</p><p>The Feed Generator interface was the first case of Bluesky as a decentralized network. From then, the Bluesky network was not solely the services which the Bluesky team operated, it was also third-party services like Feed Generator instances that plugged into the Bluesky network.</p> Dedicated “Appview” service <p>For the next step, the view logic was moved from the PDS, to an “Appview” service. This is a pretty standard approach for backend systems, to move everything view-related to its own service, and not to trouble other systems with presenting data to web and mobile applications.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa021c527-98dc-42cc-a285-368be5464ccc_1262x908.png">    </a>Splitting out application view logic into its own service  Relays to crawl the network <p>In the future, there could be hundreds or thousands of PDSs in the Bluesky network. So, how will all the data be synchronized with them? The answer is that a “crawler” will go through all these PDSs. In preparation for this crawl the team introduced a Relay service:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c32635d-bd78-4a05-938f-c996e1d1bcd3_1248x922.png">    </a>Preparing for federation and multiple PDSs by adding a Relay service to “crawl” later  4. v2 architecture: scaleable and federated <p>The v1 architecture needed to evolve in order to support full federation, and the team always planned to move on from it. But they expected v1 to last longer than only 6 months.</p> Federation <p>Federation sandbox. Before shipping a first version of federation, the team built a <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/blog/federation-sandbox">Federation Sandbox</a> to test the architecture, as a safe space to try new features like modulation and curation tooling.</p><p>Internal federation. To prepare for federation proper, the next refactoring was to add support for multiple Personal Data Servers. As a first step, the Bluesky team did this internally. Users noticed nothing of this transition, which was intentional, and Bluesky was then federated! Proving that federation worked was a large milestone.</p><p>As a reminder, federation was critical to Bluesky because it made the network truly distributed. With federation, any user can run their own Bluesky server.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F06d54413-1da4-443e-923a-da91f3f16f11_1358x994.png">    </a>Prior to federation, Bluesky created 10 PDS services, wrapped into an Entryway interface <p>The “internally federated” PDS servers worked exactly like a self-hosted PDS. Bluesky made one addition, to wrap the internal PDS servers into a new service called “Entryway,” which provides the “bsky.social” identity to the PDSes. Entryway will become the “official” Bluesky OAuth authorization server for users who choose bsky.social servers, and one operated as a self-hosted server.</p><p>Later, Bluesky increased the number of internal PDS servers from 10 to 20 for capacity reasons, and to test that adding PDS servers worked as expected.</p><p>External federation. With everything ready to support self-hosted Personal Data Servers, Bluesky flipped to switch, and started to “crawl” those servers in February 2024:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F931dce11-23dc-4836-befc-4376db9aa421_1352x1212.png">    </a>Adding support for “proper” federation. Anyone can self-host a “Bluesky instance” in PDS form <p>To date, Bluesky has more than 300 self-hosted PDSs. This change has made the network properly distributed, anyone wanting to own their data on Bluesky can self-host an instance. Over time, we could also see services launch which self-host instances and allow for full data ownership in exchange for a fee.</p> Appview: further refactoring <p>Recently, Bluesky further refactored its Appview service, and pulled out the moderation functionality into its own service, called <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/ozone">Ozone</a>:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a4114e7-8815-46d7-a777-9b2728a46fc1_1306x1248.png">    </a>Moving moderation and post labeling functionality from Appview to Ozone <p>Users can run their own Ozone service – meaning to be a moderator in the Bluesky system.

In it, they offer a detailed overview of the architecture:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87a2eec4-af41-4752-816f-15f0d8293394_1432x748.png">    </a>The architecture of Bluesky. Image source: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03239.pdf">Bluesky and the AT Protocol</a> <p>The diagram above shows how data flows occur in the application:</p>  <p>Personal data server (PDS): these can be Bluesky-hosted (around 20 today) or self-hosted (around 300)</p>  <p>Relays: these collect events from the PDSs. Bluesky has its “official” relay hosted in its own infrastructure, but other developers can set up alternative relays that listen to all PDSs.</p>  <p>Firehose: the output of the relays.</p>  <p>Labelers and feed generators: these digest firehose events. They can be Bluesky-hosted, or be hosted independently of Bluesky.</p>  <p>App View: The Bluesky-hosted “official” app view, or alternate app views</p>  <p>Data flowing back to PDSs: feed generators hosted by Bluesky or externally, feed events data back to the PDSs.</p>   5. Scaling the database layer  Scaling issues with Postgres <p>Scaling issues emerged 2-3 months after the public beta launch in mid-2023.</p>  <p>Connection pool issues and lock contention. The Postgres connection pool backup and Node’s event loop got into a bad feedback loop. The team observed Postgres lock contention issues. This refers to multiple processes trying to access the same data simultaneously, but the data is locked to all except one process. For example, when multiple processes attempt to update the same row.</p>  <p>Small Postgres outages. Postgres doesn’t give the developer much control over which <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/using-explain.html">query plan</a> it will take. Bluesky had a few smaller outages due to a query plan randomly flipping to something that ran about 1,000x times slower.</p>  <p>The need for horizontal scaling. Horizontal scaling is adding more machines to a service, so that the throughput of this system improves linearly with each new machine. But Postgres does not support horizontal scaling because it runs as a single database with transactional guarantees, meaning it becomes a bottleneck – if a necessary one – for the entire network.</p>  <p>As a reminder, the team was still tiny when all these scaling challenges emerged. There were only 6 developers (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dholms.xyz">Daniel</a>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/divy.zone">Devin</a>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bnewbold.net">Bryan</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jacob.gold">Jake</a> on the backend, and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/pfrazee.com">Paul</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/anshnanda.com">Ansh</a> on the frontend). Then in summer 2023, Daniel had a dream:</p><blockquote><p>“After one stressful day, I dreamt that me, Jay [Bluesky’s CEO], and Devin were in my backyard. There were snakes everywhere you looked. We were going to wrangle and round up the snakes in a panic. But that that point, Devin stops and says to all of us: ‘wait, wait, guys, I think there’s a Postgres extension for this!’”</p></blockquote> ScyllaDB replacing Postgres <p>The team knew they needed a horizontally scalable data storage solution, with fine-grained control of how data is indexed and queried.</p><p>ScyllaDB was an obvious choice because it supports horizontal scalability due to being a wide-column database (a NoSQL type.) Wide-column databases store data in flexible columns that can be spread across multiple servers or database rows. They can also support two rows having different columns, which gives a lot more flexibility for data storage!</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F878c2812-8d3a-4926-a3da-cd3211a5b7d9_1550x812.png">    </a>Wide-column databases store data in columns so it’s highly scalable and flexible. Two rows in one table can have different types or numbers of columns. Source: <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/choosing-an-aws-nosql-database/types-of-nosql-databases.html">AWS</a> <p>The biggest tradeoffs:</p>  <p>Data must be denormalized, meaning it isn’t stored as efficiently as in a relational database. Basically, you’ll store more data and require more storage space.</p>  <p>Data needs to be indexed on write. Writing to a wide column database is more expensive than to a relational database. For each row and column changed, the relevant indexes need to be updated, which typically makes these databases more write-intensive than relational ones.</p>  <p>The team was satisfied with their early choice of Postgres, says Daniel:</p><blockquote><p>“Postgres was great early on because we didn’t quite know exactly what questions we’d be asking of the data. It let us toss data into the database and figure it out from there. Now we understand the data and the types of queries we need to run, it frees us up to index it in Scylla in exactly the manner we need and provide APIs for the exact queries we’ll be asking.”</p></blockquote> SQLite <p>ScyllaDB is used for the Appview, which is Bluesky’s most read-heavy service. However, the Personal Data Servers use something else entirely: SQLite. This is a database written in the C language which stores the whole database in a single file on the host machine. SQLite is considered “zero configuration,” unlike most other databases that require service management – like startup scripts – or access control management. SQLite requires none of this and can be started up from a single process with no system administrative privileges. It “just works.”</p><p>Daniel explains why SQLite was ideal for the PDSs:</p><blockquote><p>“We took a somewhat novel approach of giving every user their own SQLite database. By removing the Postgres dependency, we made it possible to run a ‘PDS in a box’ without having to worry about managing a database. We didn’t have to worry about things like replicas or failover. For those thinking this is irresponsible: don’t worry, we are backing up all the data on our PDSs!”</p><p>SQLite worked really well because the PDS – in its ideal form – is a single-tenant system. We owned up to that by having these single tenant SQLite databases.</p><p>We also leaned into the fact that we’re building a federated network. We federated our data hosting in the exact same manner that it works for non-Bluesky PDSs.”&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Migrating the PDSs from Postgre to SQLite created fantastic improvement in operations, Daniel adds:</p><blockquote><p>“PDSs have been a dream to run since this refactor. They are cheap to operate (no Postgres service!) and require virtually no operational overhead!”</p></blockquote> 6. Infra stack: from AWS to on-prem <p>Bluesky’s infrastructure was initially hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and the team used infrastructure-as-a-code service, <a href="https://www.pulumi.com/">Pulumi</a>. This approach let them move quickly early on, and also to scale their infra as the network grew. Of course, as the network grew so did the infrastructure bill.&nbsp;</p> Move to on-prem <p>Cost and performance were the main drivers in moving on-prem. The team got hardware that was more than 10x as powerful as before, for a fraction of the price. How was this decision made? A key hire played a big role.</p><p>Bluesky’s first hire with large-scale experience was Jake Gold, who joined in January 2023, and began a cost analysis of AWS versus on-prem. He eventually convinced the team to make this big change.</p><p>But how did the team forecast future load, and calculate the hardware footprint they’d need? Daniel recalls:</p><blockquote><p>“We looked at the trends and tried to make a safe bet. We were thinking: ‘okay, today we're over-provisioned. We want to stay over-provisioned, so we have room to grow without upgrading the hardware, but also just so we have stability if something happens in the world, and everyone decides to post about it.’</p><p>We built our architecture to be horizontally scalable so that we can add more capacity just by throwing more machines at it. There is some lead time to buying new machines, but we have space in the rack. We have room in the network connections. The switches are good for it.</p><p>If we need to scale, it’s really just about ‘get some more servers and hook them up!’ We can get to twice the capacity after doubling the machines we’re running in our data center. This is sweet!”</p></blockquote><p>Becoming cloud-agnostic was the first step in moving off AWS. By June 2023, six months after Jake joined, Bluesky’s infrastructure was cloud agnostic.&nbsp;</p><p>Bluesky always has the option of using AWS to scale if needed, and is designed in a way that it would not be overly difficult to stand up additional virtual machines on AWS, if the existing infrastructure has capacity or scaling issues.</p><p>Today, the Personal Data Servers are bare-metal servers hosted by cloud infrastructure vendor, <a href="https://www.vultr.com/">Vultr</a>. Bluesky currently operates 20 and shards them so that each PDS supports about 300,000 users.</p> Bluesky’s load by the numbers <p>Currently, Bluesky’s system sees this sort of load:</p>  <p>60-100 events/second received by the firehose service, which is the “main” service that emits messages sent on the network in real time. During the public launch of Bluesky in February, the peak was 400 events/second.</p>  <p>400 timeline loads/second. A timeline load is when a user (or client) makes a request to fetch their current timeline.</p>  <p>3,500 requests/second across the network.</p>   7. Reality of building a social network <p>To close, we (Gergely and Elin) asked the teams some questions on what it’s like to build a high-growth social network.</p><p>What is a typical firefighting issue you often encounter?</p><blockquote><p>“Every influx of users brought new problems, and we found ourselves doing quite a bit of firefighting. One day, after a particularly notable incident, growth showed no signs of stopping, and we had to temporarily disable signups in order to keep the service running.” – Daniel</p></blockquote><p>What were the events referred to as “Elon Musk?”</p><blockquote><p>“We never quite knew when a user bump was going to come, and invites were out in the wild waiting to be used. Then something would happen, and thousands of users suddenly joined. We started referring to these days as EMEs (Elon Musk Events) because they were normally precipitated by some change on Twitter.” – Daniel</p><p>“It was a bit like throwing a party and everybody showing up 2 hours early, while you’re still setting up the chairs and telling people to get drinks from the fridge. And then about ten times more people show up than expected.” – Paul</p></blockquote><p>How are outages different for a social network?</p><blockquote><p>“Disabling signups or pausing the service is never fun to do, but it actually created a bunch of excitement and a strange sense of pride in the user base.” – Daniel</p><p>“Outages are not fun, but they’re not life and death, generally. And if you look at the traffic, usually what happens is after an outage, traffic tends to go up. And a lot of people who joined, they’re just talking about the fun outage that they missed because they weren’t on the network.” – Jake</p></blockquote><p>The whole developer team is on Bluesky, and actively responding to user feedback. How do you do this, and why?</p><blockquote><p>“People just pinging us in the app and explaining their problem, is so good. We can just respond, "Hey, can you give me a screenshot? What platform are you on?" It's such a fast support turnaround. The big benefit of building a social app is that your customers are right there, and will tell you if something's not working.</p><p>Real time user feedback was how mute words got prioritized, recently. In terms of a signal about how important something is, when you start getting PRs to add the feature, and you get a ton of people plus-oneing the issue – not to mention people asking for it in the app – that tells you a lot.” – Paul</p></blockquote> Takeaways <p>Gergely here. Many thanks to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dholms.xyz">Daniel</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/pfrazee.com">Paul</a> for part one of this deep dive into how Bluesky works! You can <a href="https://bsky.app/">try out Bluesky</a> for yourself, learn more about <a href="https://atproto.com/">Bluesky’s AT Protocol</a>, or <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03239.pdf">about its architecture</a>. And I’m also <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gergely.pragmaticengineer.com">on Bluesky</a>.</p><p>Decentralized architectures require a different way of thinking. I’ll be honest, I’m so used to building and designing “centralized” architecture, that the thought of servers being operated outside of the company is very alien. My immediate thoughts were:</p>  <p>Is it secure enough? Malicious actors could run anything on those servers and attempt to overload the network or exploit vulnerabilities in the system. The Bluesky team also stressed how the security model is something you thoroughly need to consider as you design APIs for such a system.</p>  <p>What about external nodes that don’t ever update the version of the software? How do they get bug fixes? And what about versioning? How to ensure “outdated clients” are cut off from the network?</p>  <p>Finally, I thought; “wow, this kind of reminds me of the confusion I initially felt about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skype_protocol">Skype’s peer-to-peer network</a>”</p>  <p>I’m delighted we did a deep dive about Bluesky because it has forced me to think more broadly. A server drawing on a diagram no longer just means “a group of our servers,” it can also mean “plus, a group of external servers.” Once this is understood, it’s easy. And this skill of designing distributed and federated systems may be useful in the future, as I expect the concept of distributed architecture to become more popular.</p><p>It’s impressive what a tiny team of experienced engineers can build. I had to triple-check that Bluesky’s core team was only two engineers for almost nine months, during which time they built the basics of the protocol, and made progress with the iOS and Android apps. Even now, Bluesky is a very lean team of around 12 engineers for the complexity they build with and the company’s growth.&nbsp;</p><p>In the next part of this deep dive into Bluesky, we cover more on how the team works.&nbsp;</p><p>Owning your own infrastructure instead of using the cloud seems a rational choice. Bluesky found large savings by moving off AWS once they could forecast the type of load they needed. Jake Gold, the engineer driving this transition, has been vocal about how cloud providers have become more expensive than many people realize. Speaking on the podcast, Last Week in AWS, <a href="https://www.lastweekinaws.com/podcast/screaming-in-the-cloud/building-reliable-open-source-social-media-with-jake-gold/">he said</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“With the original vision of AWS I first started using in 2006, or whenever launched, they said they would lower your bill every so often, as Moore’s law makes their bill lower. And that kind of happened a little bit here and there, but it hasn’t happened to the same degree as I think we all hoped it would.”</p></blockquote><p>Don’t forget, it’s not only Bluesky which rejects cloud providers for efficiency. We previously did a deep dive into travel booking platform Agoda, <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/inside-agodas-private-cloud">and why it isn’t on the cloud</a>.</p><p>I’m slowly changing my mind about decentralized and federated social networks. I also tried out Mastodon, which is another federated social network, when it launched. At the time, Mastodon felt a lot more clunky in onboarding than Bluesky. You had to choose a server to use, but different servers have different rules, whereas Bluesky was much smoother. Still, as a user, I was blissfully unaware of how different these social networks are from the dominant platforms.</p><p>It was only by learning about Bluesky’s architecture that I appreciated the design goals of a decentralized social network. Currently, mainstream social networks are operated exclusively by the company that owns them. But a decentralized network allows servers to be operated by other teams/organizations/individuals. This might not seem like a big deal, but it means a social network is no longer dependent on the moderation policies of a parent company.</p><p>Decentralized social networks also allows users to use custom algorithms, websites and mobile apps, which creates opportunities for developers to build innovative experiences. In contrast, you cannot build a custom third-party client for X, Threads, or LinkedIn.</p><p>I’m still unsure how much mainstream appeal decentralized social networks hold for non-technical people, but I’m rooting for Bluesky, Mastodon, and the other decentralized social apps. Perhaps they can challenge Big Tech’s dominance of social media, or at least change people’s understanding of what a social network can be.</p><p>In a follow-up issue, we’ll look deeper into the engineering culture at Bluesky: the company culture, a deeper look at the tech stack, and how they are building seemingly so much with a surprisingly small team and company. I suspect we can all learn a lot in how a dozen engineers help a startup scale to more than 5 million users.</p><p>Enjoyed this issue?

<p>近年、多要素認証(MFA)の普及が進む中、ユーザーの利便性とセキュリティのバランスを取ることが課題となっています。MFAとは、パスワードに加え、生体認証やワンタイムパスワードなど複数の認証方式を組み合わせることで、アカウントへの不正アクセスを防ぐセキュリティ手法です。しかし、MFAの導入はユーザーにとって面倒な手順が増えることを意味します。この課題を解決するために登場したのが、Syncable Authenticator(同期可能認証器)、別名Passkey(パスキー)と呼ばれる新しい認証技術です。</p>



<p>同期可能認証器は、認証に用いる秘密鍵を複数のデバイス間で同期できるようにすることで、ユーザーはどのデバイスでも同じ認証情報を使えるようになります。これにより利便性が大幅に向上します。一方で、秘密鍵を複数の端末で共有することはセキュリティ上のリスクを伴います。そこで、米国国立標準技術研究所(NIST)は、シンカブル認証器の安全な利用に関するガイドライン(SP 800-63Bの補遺)を公開しました。</p>



 
 <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-63Bsup1.pdf">NIST: Incorporating Syncable Authenticators Into NIST SP 800-63B</a> 
 



<p>この文書は、NIST Special Publication 800-63Bへの補足であり、認証キーを複製しデバイス間で同期できる同期可能認証器(パスキーとしても知られている)の使用に関するガイダンスを提供するものです。主なポイントは以下の通りです。</p>



 
 適切に構成された同期可能認証器は、中間者攻撃、検証者のなりすまし、リプレイ攻撃などの脅威を軽減し、認証の意図を提供することで、認証保証レベル2(AAL2)を達成できます。AAL2は、フィッシング耐性など高度なセキュリティを求める一方で、ある程度の使いやすさも確保するレベルです。 



 本文書では、キーの生成、保存、アクセス制御に関する一定の要件を満たすことを条件に、同期可能認証器の認証キーの複製を許可するようSP 800-63Bを更新しています。これによって、政府機関でもパスキーを使うことができるようになります。 



 WebAuthn仕様のフラグを使用して、認証器がAAL2の要件を満たしているかどうかを判断するなど、実装上の考慮事項について説明しています。エンタープライズでのユースケースでは、Attestationを利用してオーセンティケータの機能を検証することができます。 



 同期可能認証器の潜在的な脅威と課題を概説し、不正なキーの使用、同期ファブリックの侵害、失効の難しさなどを示し、それらを軽減するための方法を提案しています。 



 本文書は、一部の実装におけるユーザー間のキー共有のリスクを認識し、エンタープライズおよび公開向けのユースケースについてガイダンスを提供しています。 
 



<p>全体として、この補足資料は、適切に導入されれば、便利でフィッシング耐性のある認証を提供できる同期可能認証器の統合について、機関がリスクに基づいた informed な意思決定を行うことを目的としています。</p>



<p>本補遺は、AAL2への同期可能認証器の適合性を検証する上で重要な基準を提供しています。また、鍵の不正使用やクラウドストレージの侵害といった新たな脅威についても言及し、対策を提言しています。同期可能認証器の潜在的なリスクを認識しつつ、適切に導入することで、利便性を損なわずにセキュリティを向上できることを示しています。</p>



<p>本補遺は、セキュリティ担当者だけでなく、同期可能認証器の導入を検討する全ての関係者にとって有益な情報を提供しています。NISTによる公的なガイドラインの存在は、同期可能認証器の安全性に対する信頼を高め、普及を後押しするでしょう。ユーザー数の増加は、さらなる技術革新を促します。本補遺は、セキュリティと利便性を両立する新認証技術の健全な発展に寄与する重要な一里塚になると考えられます。</p>

 まずはじめにアイデンティティ業界の人へ 



<p>とりあえず、アイデンティティに関心のある人は、本書<a href="https://amzn.to/4d6ddRF">『メタバース進化論』</a>を読んだほうが良い。メタバース・バ美肉として現実の物理的制限から存在を解き放ち、抽象空間で取り扱うことができるようになることによって、アイデンティティとプライバシー管理の課題や要件がこんなにも明確になるのか！曰く</p>



 
 そもそも「アイデンティティ（自己同一性）とは、私たちが私たち自身をどのようなものと捉えるかという「認識」であり、他者や社会からそれが認められているという「感覚」のことです。 



 物理現実では、基本的に生まれたままの名前・姿・声を受け入れるしかありませんでした。つまり、アイデンティティとは「与えられる」ものでした。 



 基本的には与えられた固定のものを「受け入れる」しかなかった物理現実時代のそれとは違い、メタバース時代のアイデンティティは自由に「デザインする」ものになり、「なりたい自分」としての人生を送ることが可能になる 



 人間を分割可能な「分人（Dividual)」として捉える 



 複数のアイデンティティを「切り替える」ことで人生を自由にデザインできる 



 プラトンの「イデア論」〜見ている現実世界は、実体ではなく、イデアの影にすぎないのだ 



 アイデンティティを自在にデザインして「なりたい自分」になれるメタバース 
 



<p>（出所）『メタバース進化論』</p>



<p>わたしの本<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2024/04/5762/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-5762" title="<a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3xXfqP6&quot;>﨑村夏彦『デジタルアイデンティティ』日経BP (2021)</a>">1</a>やブログ、講演などに接しているかたは、「はいはいアレね」と思うだろう。次の図は、2011年6月に書いた<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2011/06/1124/">「非技術者のためのデジタル・アイデンティティ入門」</a>の頃から使いまわしている図だが、ほとんど同様のことを言っている。分人 v.s. Identity (Partial Identity) など使っている言葉は違えど殆どマッピングできる。</p>



<p>ただ、多分、本書のほうが100倍わかりやすい。これは、この図では自己像と言って抽象的に扱っているものにアバターという実体を与えて手触り感を持たせているのと同時に、何でもかんでも「属性」という分類でくくってしまわずに、「言霊世界」「視覚世界」「音響世界」のようにカテゴライズして説明しているからだろう。もちろん単純な筆力の違いもあるが。</p>



<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.sakimura.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-3.png?ssl=1"></a>



<p>【図表1】自己像（アイデンティティ）と幸福追求</p>



<p>とりわけ重要なのが、魂の自由性とか、アイデンティティは他者から与えられるものではなく自分で確立するものだというところだ。このあたり、「アイデンティティの専門家」でも忘れている人達が多い。神だとか政府だとかに与えてもらいそれを受容するものだという中世的な考え方の人たちが多いのだ。</p>



 中世的アイデンティティ v.s. 近代的アイデンティティ 



<p>近代的な個人観と中世的な個人観の主な違いは以下のようにまとめらるだろう。</p>



<p>中世的個人観</p>



 
 個人は共同体の一部として存在し、共同体からの役割や地位によって定義されていた。<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2024/04/5762/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-5762" title="<a href=&quot;https://archives.bukkyo-u.ac.jp/rp-contents/BS/0026/BS00260L276.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;>新矢 昌昭『近代 における孤独 の誕生』佛大社会学 第26号 (2001)</a>">2</a> 



 キリスト教の影響で、個人は神との関係性において「世俗外個人」として捉えられていた。<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2024/04/5762/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-5762" title="<a href=&quot;https://archives.bukkyo-u.ac.jp/rp-contents/BS/0026/BS00260L276.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;></a><a href=&quot;https://archives.bukkyo-u.ac.jp/rp-contents/BS/0026/BS00260L276.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;>新矢 昌昭『近代 における孤独 の誕生』佛大社会学 第26号 (2001)</a>">3</a>  <a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2024/04/5762/#easy-footnote-bottom-4-5762" title="<a href=&quot;https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/sstj/1/0/1_114/_pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;>藤本龍児『アメリカにおける個人主義とニュー工イジ運動 一一現代宗教の問題と課題一一』現代社会学理論研究 (2007)</a>">4</a> 



 個人の内面性よりも、共同体への所属と役割が重視されていた。<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2024/04/5762/#easy-footnote-bottom-5-5762" title="<a href=&quot;https://hermes-ir.lib.hit-u.ac.jp/hermes/ir/re/16625/studys0200000010.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;>阿部謹也「西洋中世における個人（人格） の成立に関する予備的考察」一橋大学社会科学古典資料センター Study Report, 20 (1990)</a>">5</a> 
 



<p>近代的個人観</p>



 
 個人は自律的な存在として捉えられ、個人の内面性や自我意識が重視されるようになった。<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2024/04/5762/#easy-footnote-bottom-6-5762" title="<a href=&quot;https://archives.bukkyo-u.ac.jp/rp-contents/BS/0026/BS00260L276.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;>新矢 昌昭『近代 における孤独 の誕生』佛大社会学 第26号 (2001)</a>">6</a><a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2024/04/5762/#easy-footnote-bottom-7-5762" title="<a href=&quot;https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/sstj/1/0/1_114/_pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;></a><a href=&quot;https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/sstj/1/0/1_114/_pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;>藤本龍児『アメリカにおける個人主義とニュー工イジ運動 一一現代宗教の問題と課題一一』現代社会学理論研究 (2007)</a>">7</a> 



 啓蒙主義の影響で、個人は中世的な共同体からの拘束から解放され、「内面的孤独」を経験するようになった。<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2024/04/5762/#easy-footnote-bottom-8-5762" title="<a href=&quot;https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/sstj/1/0/1_114/_pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;></a><a href=&quot;https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/sstj/1/0/1_114/_pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;>藤本龍児『アメリカにおける個人主義とニュー工イジ運動 一一現代宗教の問題と課題一一』現代社会学理論研究 (2007)</a>">8</a> 



 個人の権利や自由が強調され、個人主義的価値観が台頭した。<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2024/04/5762/#easy-footnote-bottom-9-5762" title="<a href=&quot;https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%80%8B%E4%BA%BA%E4%B8%BB%E7%BE%A9&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;>Wikipedia「個人主義</a>">9</a><a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2024/04/5762/#easy-footnote-bottom-10-5762" title="<a href=&quot;https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/sstj/1/0/1_114/_pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;></a><a href=&quot;https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/sstj/1/0/1_114/_pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;>藤本龍児『アメリカにおける個人主義とニュー工イジ運動 一一現代宗教の問題と課題一一』現代社会学理論研究 (2007)</a>">10</a> 



 プライバシーの概念が生まれ、私的領域が神聖視されるようになった。<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2024/04/5762/#easy-footnote-bottom-11-5762" title="<a href=&quot;https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%80%8B%E4%BA%BA%E4%B8%BB%E7%BE%A9&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;>Wikipedia「個人主義</a>">11</a> 
 



<p>つまり、中世では個人は共同体の一部として捉えられていたのに対し、近代では個人の自律性と内面性が強調され、個人主義的価値観が確立されたということができる。魂の自由性と言っても良い。でも残念ながら、この個人主義的価値観・近代的個人観に行き着いていない人が結構多い。だから、アバターは現実世界の自分に似ていなければならないだとか、アイデンティティウォレットには政府発行の個人属性証明(PID)を入れて、それを中心に回していくとかの考えになってくる。</p>



<p>これは別にウォレットに限ったことではなくて、Web 2.0的なSNSにおける本人確認でも似たようなことが起きてくる。先ほど経験したことだと、LinkedInで本人確認済みにするには、氏名はパスポート表記と同一でなければならないという。パスポート表記などというのは、国境を超えるときの識別子として政府に登録されたものであって、自分を表出するものではない。わたしは英語では Nat Sakimura として活動しているが、それが「本人確認」をすると、Natsuhiko Sakimuraであることを強制される。なんだそれは。そんなことしたら過去の業績とのリンクができなくなるではないか。いやそんな些細なことではない。名乗りを奪うということは、人格を否定することに等しい。ちょうど千と千尋の神隠しの湯婆婆が千尋の名前を奪うように。</p>



<p>まさに、本書がいうように、名前は「言霊世界のアイデンティティ」なのだ。この「名乗りの自由性」はとても大切だ。なぜならば、本書が言うように『周りの方々からこの「言霊」で毎日繰り返し呼びかけられ続けることで、わたしは◯◯としての自己認識を獲得することができる』からだ。</p>



<p>また、言うまでもなく「アバター：視覚世界のアイデンティティ」（本書）の自由性も重要だ。『自分自身の「アイデンティティ表現」としてみた時は現実のような「人間」のかたちに縛られたくない』（本書）からだ。それともあれだろうか。四肢が不自由だったら、メタバースでも四肢が不自由でなければいけないとでも言うのか。</p>



<p>その自由性の象徴がバ美肉である。日本では、人形浄瑠璃や歌舞伎の女形などの文化的背景がありだいぶ受容が進んできたが、西洋ではヘタをしたら５６されかねない。バ美肉を受容できるかどうかは、潜在的な差別意識のあるなしのリトマス試験紙になる。</p>



<p>本書ではMetaが規制を入れてくる可能性に触れているが、AppleもVision Pro でやってきても驚かない。場合によっては、VRのアバタを簡単に作らさせるためにUXとしてそういうことにするといってくるかもしれない。だがこうした動きには徹底抗戦しなければなるまい。日本では、自己イメージコントロール権説や、「身だしなみなどに関する自己決定権」から、「なりたい自分になれる権利」は認められ、間接適用説からmetaなど事業者もこの権利の侵害は許されないはずだ<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2024/04/5762/#easy-footnote-bottom-12-5762" title="naka2656 <a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/so6287/status/1781800580421398972&quot;>https://twitter.com/so6287/status/1781800580421398972</a> ">12</a>。</p>



<p>こうしたアイデンティティに関する話は第4章にまとめられているので、時間がなかったらまずそこだけでも読んでほしいところだ。</p>



 プライバシーに関しても参考になる 



<p>また、アイデンティティと違って一つの章になっているわけではないが、プライバシーに関しても参考になる記述がいろいろとある。曰く、</p>



 
 同じく日本の伝統芸能「人形浄瑠璃」でも、優美に踊る美しい女性の人形の背後には黒子のおじさんが見えてしまっています。しかし、それを指摘するのは野暮 
 



<p>これは、「データが見えてしまっても、意図された目的以外では使ってはいけない」というデータ保護の基本につながる。わたしが昔から<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2015/08/3183/">「大人のプライバシー」</a>と呼んでいるものだ。もちろん「なりたい自分になれる」というのが、「自己イメージコントロール権」<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2024/04/5762/#easy-footnote-bottom-13-5762" title="「人間が自由に形成しうるとことの社会関係の多様性に応じて、多様な 自己イメージを使い分ける自由をプライヴァシーと呼ぶ」(自由な社会関係を前 提として、自己イメージのコントロール権) 出所：棟居快行『人権論の新構成』信山社(1992)187-195頁。">13</a>と表裏一体であるのは言うまでもなく。</p>



<p>ISOでは現在、メタバースのプライバシーについての検討が始まっているが、関係者にぜひ本書を読ませたいところだ。英語版がほしい。</p>



 もちろんメタバースの解説も 



<p>さて、自分がアイデンティティ＆プライバシー業界の人間だから、いきなりそのあたりの各論に入ってしまったが、そもそも本書はメタバースについての本だ。「メタバースの定義：実現に必要な七要件」であるとか、4大ソーシャルVRの紹介であるとか、それらを支える技術であるとか、メタバースに住む住民たちの特性、なぜ人々はバ美肉になるのか、などなど、データの裏付けをとりながらきっちりと解説している。しかも、マーカーで線を引きたくなるようなキャッチーなフレーズが満載で。たとえばこんな感じ：</p>



 
 声：音響世界のアイデンティティ 



 自分の精神に作用するプロテウス効果 



 バ美肉は枯山水。見立ての文化の延長線。 



 （現在は）「永遠に新しいことを学び続けていく」ことが当然（の社会）。すべての人が永遠に「未熟」であることを受け入れざるを得ない社会において、「大人としての自尊心」に変わる新たな価値観こそが、お互いの「未熟さ」を愛おしいと思う価値観「かわいい」 
 



<p>（出所）『メタバース進化論』</p>



<p>わたしは、Kindleで大量に線を引きながら読んでしまった。上記はそのほんの一部だ。ぜひ本書を買って読んいただきたい。</p>



 動画による解説も一緒にみるとなお良し 



<p>なお、本書は文章による紹介としては大変優れているが、やはりメタバースのイメージを得るには映像のほうが適している。そういう意味で、筆者である「バーチャル美少女ねむ」さんが、国連のIGF 2023で行ったプレゼン「バーチャル美少女だけど国連登壇してみた」も並行して見ることをおすすめする。非常にわかりやすいプレゼンだ。英語ですが…。</p>



 

 



<p></p>



<p>これは、国連が主催するインターネット・ガバナンス・フォーラム（IGF<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2024/04/5762/#easy-footnote-bottom-14-5762" title="Internet Governance Forum">14</a> ）2023 京都のDay 0</p>



 
 <a href="https://intgovforum.org/en/content/igf-2023-day-0-event-134-talk-with-metaverse-residents-%E2%80%93-a-new-identity-and-diversity">「Event No.134 Talk with Metaverse residents – a new identity and diversity | Internet Governance Forum」</a>（2023年10月8日 18:00〜19:00)  
 



<p>の模様を録画したものだ。わたしもこの日だけは、自分のセッション<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2024/04/5762/#easy-footnote-bottom-15-5762" title="<a href=&quot;https://intgovforum.org/en/content/igf-2023-day-0-event-42-%E2%80%9Ctrusted-personal-data-management-service%EF%BC%88tpdms%EF%BC%89%E2%80%9D-program&quot;>IGF 2023 Day 0 Event #42 “Trusted Personal Data Management Service（TPDMS）” Program</a>">15</a>があったのでIGFの会場にいたのに、生参加できなくて残念だった。多分この時間はOECDの人とTrusted Data Intermeidaries (TDI: 信頼できるデータ仲介者) について話していたと思う。</p>



 というわけで 



<p>本書、本当におすすめだ。サンフランシスコからの機内で読んでいて、第４章を読んでいて涙が自然に流れ出てきたくらい。ぜひ買って読みましょう！</p>

<p>Last week I appeared on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2dN_We23tU" title="Hacking Postgres S2E3: David Wheeler, Principal Architect, Tembo">s02e03</a> of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL11N188AYb_Z04oQJgllNEY5m7gCcY8tH">Hacking Postgres</a> podcast.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The experience I had after my independent Consulting gig for 10 years working
in companies was, like, bringing up other people and being supportive of other
people and hearing from a diversity of voices and perspectives makes
everything better.</p>
<p>That’s part of why I want to get so much input on and feedback on the stuff
that I’m hoping do with PGXN v2 — or whatever we ultimately call it. But
people matter, more than the technology, more than any of the rest of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I quite enjoyed this wide-ranging discussion. We covered my history with the
Postgres community, a bunch of the projects I’ve worked on over the years,
plans and hopes for the <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PGXNv2" title="Postgres Wiki: PGXN v2">PGXN v2</a> project, perspectives on people and
technology, and exciting new and anticipated features of Postgres. Find it

<p>Summary: The abundance of X.509 certificate authorities who already perform identity proofing for businesses provides a rich resouce that can be leveraged to boot the verifiable data ecosystem. Here’s how it could work. </p><p>When you used a verifiable credential to prove something about yourself, the verifier can know cryptographically: (1) the identifiers for the issuer, (2) the credential hasn't been tampered with, (3) the credential was issued to you, and (4) the credential hasn't been revoked. These four checks are important because their establish the fidelity of the data being transferred. They don't, however, tell them <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity#risk">whether they can trust the issuer</a>. For that, they need to take the issuer's decentralized identifier (DID) that they got from credential presentation and determine who it belongs to.</p><p>At <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com">Internet Identity Workshop</a> last week, Drummond Reed gave a session on how X.509 certificates could help with this. The first step, like always, is to resolve the DID and retrieve the DIDDoc that associates keys and endpoints with the DID. The endpoint can be an HTTP server and, of course, should have an X.509 certificate providing TLS security. That certificate, at the very least, has a a domain name to bind that to the certificate's public key. It can, if you pay for the feature, also include information about the entity that applied for the certificate. The certificate authority proofs that information and is vouching for it when they sign the certificate.</p><p>The key to making the X.509 certificate useful for checking the provenance of a DID lies in one key change. X.509 certificates can contain and extended field called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject_Alternative_Name">Subject Alternative Name</a>. This following figure shows how it can help.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa8d494fa-9a2c-46fb-ba9b-81180e00beaf.heic">    </a>Using X.509 Certificates to establish the owner of a DID   <p>The issuer (Attestor) creates the DID they will use to issue the certificate along with its associated DIDDoc, including an HTTP endpoint for DID verification.</p>  <p>Attestor applies for a X.509 certificate for that endpoint, including in the application the DID they created in (1).</p>  <p>The certificate authority does it's usual proofing of the application and issues a certificate that includes the DID in the Subject Alternative Name field.</p>  <p>The issuer creates a credential definition in the usual way that includes their DID and writes it to whatever Verifiable Data Registry their DID method dictates.</p>  <p>Attestor issues a credential to a holder (Alice) using that credential definition.</p>  <p>At some later time, Alice presents the credential to the verifier (Certiphi).</p>  <p>Certiphi resolves the DID to get the DIDDoc and retrieves the verfication endpoint from the DIDDoc</p>  <p>Certiphi retrieves the certificate for that endpoint1.</p>  <p>Certiphi verifies the certificate by checking it's signature and ensures that the DID in the DIDDoc for the credential matches the one in certificate.2</p>  <p>The issuer's DID has now been tied in a verifiable way to whatever information is in the certificate. Provided the certificate includes information about the entity beyond the domain name, the verifier can use that information to determine whether or not the credential is authentic (i.e., issued by who the credential definition purports issued it). That might be all the evidence they need to determine whether to trust the entity. Certificate authorities could also issue verifiable credentials to the customer attesting the same verified claims—after all, it's one more product they can offer.</p><p>The benefit of doing issuer validation using X.509 certificates is that there are already many trusted X.509 certificate authorities in business who already do proofing of attributes about businesses. That's a huge chunk of the verifiable data ecosystem that doesn't need to be built because it can be leveraged. To make this work, digital certificate authorities would need to start offering to validate DIDs and include them in a certificate as a Subject Alternative Name. I don't discount that this will take some bureaucratic maneuvering. Certificate authorities will need to see a business opportunity. I'd love to see <a href="https://digitcert.com/">Digitcert</a> or someone do a pilot on this.</p> Notes   <p>Note that this step might be combined with the previous step if the Verifiable Data Registry is the same server as the endpoint, but that's not necessarily going to be the case for a number of reasons.</p>  <p>Note that this does not create a call back wherein Attestor can determine which credential was used, preserving the privacy of the presentation. Attestor does know one of its credentials has been presented to Certiphi. </p>  <p><a href="https://www.technometria.com/subscribe?">Subscribe now</a></p><p><a href="https://www.technometria.com/p/using-x509-certs-for-did-provenance?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share">Share</a></p><p></p>

The Santa Barbara library, viewed from the county courthouse. Is this where the dead local paper’s archives will go? How about future archives of all the local news organs?
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Barbara_News-Press">Santa Barbara News-Press</a> was born in 1868 and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/24/santa-barbara-news-press-bankruptcy">died</a> in 2023 at age 155.

<p>That ride began with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Barbara_News-Press_controversy">Santa Barbara&nbsp;News Press&nbsp;Controversy</a> in 2006 and ended when Ampersand, the company McCaw created to hold the paper’s bag of assets (which did not include its <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/docsearls/252584558/in/album-72157594299505924/">landmark building</a> downtown, which <a href="https://www.independent.com/2024/01/05/bankruptcy-trustee-for-santa-barbara-news-press-attempts-to-claw-back-buildings/">McCaw kept</a>), filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in late July of last year. Here are stories about the death of the paper in three local news journals that have done a great job of taking up the slack left when the News-Press began to collapse, plus one in the LA Times:</p>

<p>I followed those with this in <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2023/08/18/we-need-deep-news/">We Need Deep News</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>From what I’ve read so far (and I’d love to be wrong) none of those news reports touch on the subject of the&nbsp;News-Press‘ archives, which conceivably reach back across the century and a half it was published. There can’t be a better first draft of history for Santa Barbara than that one. If it’s gone, the loss is incalculable. (August 18 2023)</p></blockquote>
<p>Last month brought bad news about that:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.independent.com/2024/03/08/santa-barbara-news-press-online-assets-nearly-sold/">‘Santa Barbara News-Press’ Online Assets to Be Sold: Bankruptcy Sale for $250,000 Subject to Bids in April</a>, by Jean Yamamura in the Santa Barbara Independent&nbsp;March 8, 2024

Now a faraway buyer wants its assets: The Santa Barbara News-Press’s digital assets are up for sale. Locals worry they could become a farm for AI-generated SEO bait</a>. By Ernie Smith in&nbsp;Fast Company. (March 5, 2024) 
 <a href="https://www.independent.com/2024/03/29/santa-barbaras-collective-memory-sold-for-kindling/">Santa Barbara’s Collective Memory, Sold for Kindling: Will ‘NewsPress.Com’ Become a Zombie Website?</a> by William Belfiore in the&nbsp;Independent. (March 29, 2024) 
 
<p>But then, thanks to William Belfiore’s appeal in that last piece, we learned this:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.independent.com/2024/04/09/santa-barbara-news-press-website-goes-to-local-kids/">‘Santa Barbara News-Press’ Website Goes to ‘Local Kids’ Group Fronted by Ben Romo Makes Winning Auction Bid of $285,000</a>, by Jean Yamamura in&nbsp;the Independent (Apr 09, 2024) 
 
<p>The only mention of archives was in the closing sentences of that piece:</p>
<blockquote><p>The purchase of the website included the Santa Barbara News-Press trademark, which would be important to the groups looking at the physical archive of back issues, photographs, and clippings by topic. Romo, who was once a paper boy for the daily, acknowledged that his group was supportive of the archive remaining local, too.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don’t know what that means, and I haven’t checked. But I am sure that the archives ought to be managed by the community as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common-pool_resource">common pool resource</a>.</p>
<p>As it happens, my wife and I are visiting scholars at the <a href="https://ostromworkshop.indiana.edu/">Ostrom Workshop</a> at Indiana University, which is concerned with this kind of thing, because its namesake, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom">Elinor Ostrom</a>, won a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Memorial_Prize_in_Economic_Sciences">Nobel Prize in Economics</a> for her work on how commons are self-governed. In her landmark book, <a href="https://archive.org/details/governingthecommons">Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action</a>, she lists eight principles for managing a commons, which are summarized <a href="https://www.onthecommons.org/magazine/elinor-ostroms-8-principles-managing-commmons/index.html">here</a>:</p>
 
 Define clear group boundaries. 
 Match rules governing use of common goods to local needs and conditions. 
 Ensure that those affected by the rules can participate in modifying the rules. 
 Make sure the rule-making rights of community members are respected by outside authorities. 
 Develop a system, carried out by community members, for monitoring members’ behavior. 
 Use graduated sanctions for rule violators. 
 Provide accessible, low-cost means for dispute resolution. 
 Build responsibility for governing the common resource in nested tiers from the lowest level up to the entire interconnected system. 
 
<p>Journalists, especially those who report news, are not herding animals. They tend to be competitive and territorial by both nature and purpose. So the collection of news entities I wrote about in <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2023/08/31/we-need-wide-news/">We Need Wide News</a> and <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2023/09/15/we-need-whole-news/">We Need Whole News</a> will almost certainly not cohere into a commons such as Lin (her nickname) Ostrom addresses in that list.</p>
<p>But they should cohere around archives—not only because that’s the right thing to do, but because they need those archives. We all do.</p>
<p>So I hope Santa Barbara’s many journals, journalists, friends, supporters, and interested local institutions get together around this challenge. Build a commons around those archives, whatever and wherever they happen to be.</p>
<p>Meanwhile here in Bloomington, my other hometown, we are pushing forward with <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2024/03/19/the-online-local-chronicle/">The Online Local Chronicle</a> that <a href="https://bsquarebulletin.com/">Dave Askins</a> wrote about in the previous installment in <a href="https://doc.searls.com/news-commons/">this series</a>. We might call that a commons interest here.</p>

  Journalism as we knew it is washing away. But the story is bigger than journalism alone, and bigger than a story alone can tell. (Image&nbsp;<a href="https://despair.com/products/bitterness">borrowed from</a>&nbsp;the brilliant&nbsp;<a href="http://despair.com/">Despair.com</a>.)
<p>We who care about journalism are asked to join the&nbsp;<a href="https://savejournalism.org/">Save Journalism Project</a>, and its fight against Big Tech. Their pitch begins,</p>

  

<p>and adds,</p>

  

<p>On the first point, we should note that journalists have been working for magazines, broadcasters, newsletters and themselves for many dozens of years. So journalism isn’t just about newspapers. Also, because so many journalists have long made livings in those other media, the loss of work is far greater than the 2,400 gone from newspapers. It’s truly massive. I don’t know any field where the loss of paying jobs is larger on a percentage basis. Not taxi driving, not hospitality, not retail, not manufacturing… not anything I can think of. (Well, maybe nuns. I don’t see many of those these days.)</p>
<p>We should also respect the simple fact that now there is more journalism than ever: in blogs, social media, podcasting, and other places. Most of those kinds of journalism don’t pay, but that doesn’t disqualify the work from the label. Hell, I’m committing journalism here and this doesn’t pay.</p>
<p>“The story of big tech’s threat to journalism” (what the Project wants us all to tell) is also something of a red herring because it distracts our attention from causes much bigger than Big Tech.</p>
<p>Every new technology “works us over completely,” Marshall McLuhan says (in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Medium_Is_the_Massage">The Medium is the Massage</a>). And no new medium, no new technologies, have ever worked us more than the digital kind. The change began with digital tech and integrated circuits and then went absolute with the Internet. Together, digital technologies and the Internet have radiacally changed our species, our civilization, and our planet.</p>
<p>Not long ago, in a conversation about this with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joi_Ito">Joi Ito</a>, I asked him how big he thought the digital transformation was. Bigger than broadcast? Print? Writing? Speech? Stone tools?</p>
<p>“No,” he replied. “It’s the biggest thing since&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Oxygenation_Event">oxygenation</a>.” In case you don’t remember, that happened between about two and a half billion years ago. (Joi also writes about it <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ideas-joi-ito-great-digitization-event/">here</a>.)</p>
<p>So, while journalism matters enormously, it’s just one casualty of digitalization. And, let’s face it, a beneficiary as well. Either way, we need to understand the whole picture, which is about a lot more than what journalism sees happening in the mirror.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.digitallife.center/">Here’s one outfit</a> working on that bigger picture. I‘m involved with it.</p>
<p>I also don’t expect most journalists to take much interest in the subject, because it’s too big, and it doesn’t make full sense as a story, which is journalism’s stock in trade. (I explain a bit about journalism’s “story problem” in&nbsp;<a href="https://tedxsantabarbara.com/2018/doc-searls/">this TEDx talk</a>.)</p>
<p>Still, some journalists are on the case, including me. Love to have others join in. But please don’t bother if you think Big Tech is alone to blame. Because the story is bigger than that, and far more than a story.</p>
 
<p>I just copied and pasted this post from <a href="https://dsearls.medium.com/this-thing-is-bigger-than-journalism-3be89a2cef68">here in Medium</a>, where I posted it in July 2019. It expands on a post now archived <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231206175314/http://my.1999.io/users/dsearls/2019/06/10/thisThingIsBiggerThanJournalism.html">here</a>. It’s kinda sad that not much has changed over all that time.</p>

The company behind Devin had since toned down expectations. Also: open source solution AutoCodeRover is offering even better performance than Devin’s closed-source and not-yet-publicly available tool. This space is commoditizing rapidly.</p>  <p>Microsoft’s disturbingly realistic AI video generator. Microsoft Research showcased a tool that generated very realistic videos from a single image. The #1 use case will surely be fraudulent deepfakes generation. This development could well speed up AI regulation in several countries.</p>  <p>Hiring upticks at Meta, Netflix and Amazon?

<p>👋 Hi, this is Gergely with a subscriber-only issue of the Pragmatic Engineer Newsletter. In every issue, I cover challenges at Big Tech and startups through the lens of engineering managers and senior engineers. To get articles like this in your inbox, every week, subscribe:</p><p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/subscribe?">Subscribe now</a></p><blockquote> Q: “As a software engineer, I’d like to learn more about security engineering. What’s a good way to understand this vast field?” </blockquote><p>Security is so important in our industry. There’s frequently news stories about security incidents, like the authentication provider Okta which was breached, then responded poorly and <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-pulse-67">got schooled on “Security 101” practices by its own customer, Cloudflare</a>. The criticism that followed for Okta was inevitable and also deserved, as it essentially sells security. But what about engineers who want to build things securely, where do they start?</p><p>I figured there’s no better place to find out than by asking a security engineer, so I reached out to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nieletdmello">Nielet D'Mello</a>. She’s a security engineer at Datadog, whose job is incorporating security into products from the very start of the development process. Nielet has been working in the security domain for nearly a decade, and before that she was at Intel, where she worked closely with the security team, as well as at McAfee, in consumer and enterprise security products. Nielet’s also speaks at security conferences – here’s her 2023 talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6sx8HVzVKA&amp;t=9s">on security design and guidance at scale</a>.</p><p>In today’s issue, Nielet takes us through:</p>  <p>Myths and misconceptions about security engineering. Common misconceptions, like that security is only security engineers' responsibility, or that security through obscurity is sufficient, and other myths.</p>  <p>History of security engineering. Security engineering’s evolution since the 1990s; especially network and perimeter defense up to today.</p>  <p>The present. A transformation to a proactive approach, and a shift to “decentralized security.”</p>  <p>A mental model. Seven core dimensions for thinking about application security, with a close look at each one.</p>  <p>Towards a Secure SDLC. An approach to make all steps of the software development lifecycle (SDLC,) “security-first.”</p>  <p><a href="http://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/security-engineering-part-2">In Part 2</a>, we cover:</p>  <p>Defining the criticality of a system.</p>  <p>Scoring a system’s criticality.</p>  <p>Threat modeling.</p>  <p>Security paved roads.</p>  <p>“Defense in depth,” “least privilege,” and “zero trust.”</p>  <p>As a note, throughout this article we cover application security engineering (aka, “AppSec.”) This is the most common type of security engineering at tech companies building software products. Other specializations within security engineering include cloud security (focusing on cloud infrastructure security,) infrastructure security (securing hardware, operating systems, middleware,) and even physical security (physical access controls and surveillance.) These topics are out of scope for this series.</p><p>With that, it’s over to Nielet.</p> Common security engineering terms <p>Hi! We use three terms frequently in this article, so let’s start by defining them:</p>  <p>Vulnerability: An exploitable flaw or weakness in a system’s design, implementation or deployment</p>  <p>Threat: The potential for a threat actor to exploit a vulnerability</p>  <p>Risk: Loss or damage that could occur when a threat actualizes</p>   Security engineering vs software engineering <p>How intertwined are security engineering and software engineering?</p><p>When it comes to software engineering, there’s nothing too special about security. Yet, its extensive depth, breadth, and nuance, mean the security domain has long felt intimidating to engineers. But it has existed for as long as software engineering; so, why does security engineering still feel like an “emerging” field?&nbsp;</p><p>It’s due to software engineering’s ever-increasing complexity: distributed systems, microservices, cloud computing, Artificial Intelligence (AI,) and more. Security engineering aims to stay ahead in this dynamic, ever-evolving threat landscape, and businesses are starting to prioritize it more.</p><p>Some statistics reveal why investing in security is increasingly important:</p>  <p>$4.45M: global average <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">cost of a single data breach</a> in 2023, a 15% rise over 3 years</p>  <p>16% more application security attack surfaces. In 2023 alone, this meant <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/browse-by-date.php">29,000 new vulnerabilities</a> were identified, which organizations need to defend against.</p>  <p>A security engineering organization is usually tasked with:</p>  <p>Risk prevention and detection: Aim to defend an organization's assets: its data, applications, code, infrastructure, etc.</p>  <p>Response and recovery: react to threats and remediate attacks.</p>   1. Myths and misconceptions about security engineering <p>I’ve observed several common misconceptions, and this article seems like a good place to debunk them.</p> Myth #1: Security is only the responsibility of security engineers <p>This is surprisingly common, but not exactly true. Security engineers are stewards of the organization's overall security posture, but realistically, they can never keep up with all developments in the product and platform space – just within their organizations!&nbsp;</p><p>Security teams also tend to be lean, meaning there aren’t many engineers. If they focus too much on the weeds; like constantly triaging incidents or security findings, this will take away from high-value work that brings company-wide impact. Examples of high-value work include:</p>  <p>Security design reviews done product-wide</p>  <p>Building and running programs and services for a secure software development lifecycle</p>  <p>Relying solely on a security team to make all security design decisions is a common anti-pattern. Amazon Web Services, in its “AWS Well-Architected” guide, recommends against this practice, and instead <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_appsec_build_program_that_embeds_security_ownership_in_teams.html">suggests</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“Build a program or mechanism that empowers builder teams to make security decisions about the software that they create. Your security team still needs to validate these decisions during a review, but embedding security ownership in builder teams allows for faster, more secure workloads to be built. This mechanism also promotes a culture of ownership that positively impacts the operation of the systems you build. (...)<br><br>Common anti-patterns:</p>  <p>Leaving all security design decisions to the security team</p>  <p>Not addressing security requirements early enough in the development process.</p>  <p>Not obtaining feedback from builders and security people on the operation of the program.”</p>  </blockquote> Myth #2: Security through obscurity is sufficient <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity">Security through obscurity</a> is the assumption that safeguarding certain details or functions of a system's operations can guarantee security. The principle is, “if only we know how this thing works, then it will be secure enough because others won’t be able to figure it out.”</p><p>This approach leads to a false sense of security! It can also lead to exploits. For example:</p><p>You have a web application with an admin panel, and this panel has features like managing users, managing content, and configuring the system. The admin panel has URL endpoints like /admin/user-management, /admin/content-management, /admin/system-configuration. How do you make these endpoints secure? The obvious way is to add authentication. However, this is a lot of effort. A simpler idea is to use obfuscation, remapping URLs to something hard to guess:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc5315e72-1cfe-45f4-910f-7a7bb8c88333_1574x1444.png">    </a>Security through obscurity. The newly mapped URLs at the bottom are obscurer, but no more secure than those at the top <p>In this case, the developer relies on the obscurity of the URLs to prevent unauthorized access. However, all it takes is for the URL endpoints information to leak, or an attacker to brute-force the URLs, and the website can be exploited.</p> Myth #3: More security measures makes software more secure <p>It’s tempting to believe, right? Unfortunately, in my experience, it’s simply untrue.</p><p>Implementing multiple security measures can enhance the overall security posture of software, but it’s essential to strike a balance between security and usability. For each security measure, carefully consider these things:</p>  <p>Effectiveness</p>  <p>Complexity</p>  <p>Performance impact</p>  <p>Management overhead</p>  <p>Your goal should be that collectively, the security measures provide meaningful protection against threats to the product or platform.</p> Myth #4: Once secure, always secure <p>So, your system passed all its security reviews and penetration tests, and you have evidence it is secure. Can you now step away, and assume it will continue to be secure? No!</p><p>The threat landscape is constantly changing. Over the past year, there’s been a surge in attacks aimed at businesses and organizations around the world. These attacks intended to damage brands’ reputations, steal sensitive data, seek financial gain, and more. They are often done by ransomware groups, such as BlackCat’s attack on <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/03/blackcat-ransomware-group-implodes-after-apparent-22m-ransom-payment-by-change-healthcare/">Change Healthcare</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/19/hackers-threaten-to-leak-80gb-of-confidential-data-stolen-from-reddit/">Reddit</a>, or mass account hacking through <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/credential-stuffing/">credential-stuffing</a>.</p><p>New vulnerabilities and attack vectors emerge regularly. For example, applications built on top of large language models (LLMs) are now susceptible to prompt injection, which is a class of attack against applications built on top of LLMs. They work by concatenating untrusted user input with a trusted prompt constructed by the application’s developer. So, security mechanisms built against existing injection attacks must factor this in, as security measures that used to be effective become obsolete or insufficient against new and advanced threats, rendering software vulnerable.</p><p>Things that can introduce vulnerabilities and weaken your overall security posture:</p>  <p>Accumulation of technical debt</p>  <p>Using deprecated components and libraries</p>  <p>Outdated dependencies</p>  <p>Security vulnerabilities in a dependency, framework, library, or service</p>  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-day_(computing)">Zero-day exploits</a> are disclosed vulnerabilities for which no patch is available. These are a special kind of vulnerability, unknown to all consumers of the software. Finding such exploits is very challenging, but organizations with large security teams can do it. For example, Google <a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/a-review-of-zero-day-in-the-wild-exploits-in-2023/">discovered</a> 93 zero-days in 2023.</p>  <p>Regulatory requirements and industry standards often mandate regular security assessments, audits and updates, to ensure compliance with data protection laws and regulations. Adhering to these requirements may necessitate ongoing security improvements, regardless of the software's initial security status.</p> Myth #5: Penetration testing by itself ensures security <p>Penetration testing, aka pen testing, involves simulating real-world security attacks against a system, network, application, or organization's infrastructure. The main goal is to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in a system's security defenses, mimicking the tactics, techniques, and procedures of attacks. Pen testing allows organizations to understand their security posture and to prioritize remediation efforts accordingly.</p><p>Downsides of pen testing:</p>  <p>It’s a snapshot of the security posture at a single, specific moment</p>  <p>Costly and labor-intensive</p>  <p>A system deemed secure by a penetration test one day, may become vulnerable the next day to new exploits or changes in the environment. Plus, scoping plays a huge role in the impact of penetration test results. Scoping refers to applications, users, networks, devices, accounts, and other assets that should be tested to achieve the organization's objectives. </p><p>When pen tests are incorrectly scoped, broader security issues or systemic weaknesses may be missed, which attackers can exploit. Scoping pen tests correctly means providing enough information for the pen testing team upfront, so they can be productive. Here’s a summary from Jessica La Bouve, Solutions Architect at penetration testing vendor, BishopFox, on <a href="https://bishopfox.com/blog/bad-scope-bad-pen-test">the importance of scoping</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“If a criminal has decided to target you, they have infinite time to find your weaknesses. (...) The assessment team has a finite amount of time to identify critical weaknesses. What they’re able to accomplish in that time depends on the amount of information you give them during scoping. (...)</p><p>Keeping your pen tester in the dark only makes it harder for them to find weaknesses that you need to fix. Even if an attacker starts from zero, they have plenty of time to conduct reconnaissance and learn a lot about your organization, giving your pen tester a head start means they can get right down to the business of finding the real threats to your systems. Attackers also don’t have any limitations on what they can try. They don’t usually worry about knocking your systems offline, but a pen tester would. To maximize a pen tester’s limited time and balance out the technical limitations placed on them, provide as much information as you can.”</p></blockquote> 2. History of security engineering <p>Security engineering teams tend to be lean by design and also by constraints, like the specialized skill sets needed, and budget limitations. This lean approach applies at whatever the scale of a company.&nbsp;</p><p>Security teams are much smaller than product/platform engineering teams, and tend to be “two-pizza teams” of between 5-10 application security engineers. As the security org is small, it focuses on projects and initiatives offering high return on investment in value, risk reduction, and impact terms.</p><p>If we look at the evolution of security engineering, there’s been significant shifts over the decades due to technological advancement, changes in threat landscapes, and systems’ increasing interconnectedness. Below are some examples.</p> The 1990s&nbsp; <p>The widespread adoption of the internet led to the development of various secure protocols (SSL, HTTPS,) and measures like firewalls and antivirus software to protect networks and data. The primary focus of security activities was network and perimeter defense, largely due to the dominance of client server architectures.&nbsp;</p> The 2000s <p>Web applications gained popularity and security engineering shifted focus towards securing web applications and the network. As web vulnerabilities like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection">SQL injection</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting">cross-site scripting</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow">buffer overflows</a> became common, so did awareness of and focus on secure coding practices.&nbsp;</p><p>Around the same time, compliance and regulatory frameworks like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOX_404_top%E2%80%93down_risk_assessment">SOX</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act#Security_Rule">HIPAA</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Card_Industry_Data_Security_Standard">PCI DSS </a>came into effect, and led organizations to boost efforts to comply with security requirements and guidelines.</p> Early 2010s <p>Cloud computing created new security challenges, like data privacy, data encryption, secure authentication, access control, and secure infrastructure configurations. The vulnerability landscape evolved in tandem with rapid technological shifts, and security shifted to efforts to automate security testing and remediation.</p> Mid-2010s, early 2020s <p>The rise of containerization and microservices architecture, the emerging field of AI and machine learning, and a shift to zero-trust architectures. This means security engineering must deal with increased complexity and more attack vectors.</p> 3. Security engineering today

<p>People aren't digitally embodied. As a result their online relationships are anemic. As we think about the kinds of digital identity systems that will help people live authentic online lives, we must build identity system that give people tools to operationalize rich digital relationships. </p><p>Identity is the ability to recognize, remember, and react to people, organizations, systems, and things. In the current web, companies employ many ponderous technological systems to perform those functions. In these systems, we are like ghosts in the machines. We have "accounts" in companies' systems, but no good way to recognize, remember, and react to them or anyone else. We are not digital embodied.</p><p>One of great benefits of embodiment is the ability to form and operationalize rich digital relationships. I've written a lot about the nature of digital relationships.</p>  <p><a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml">Relationships and Identity</a></p>  <p><a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/authentic_digital_relationships.shtml">Authentic Digital Relationships</a></p>  <p><a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/08/ephemeral_relationships.shtml">Ephemeral Relationships</a></p>  <p><a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/11/operationalizing_digital_relationships.shtml">Operationalizing Digital Relationships</a></p>  <p><a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/12/relationships_in_the_self-sovereign_internet_of_things.shtml">Relationships in the Self-Sovereign Internet of Things</a></p>  <p><a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml">The Architecture of Identity Systems</a></p>  <p><a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2022/03/are_transactional_relationships_enough.shtml">Are Transactional Relationships Enough?</a></p>  <p><a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/09/fluid_multi-pseudonymity.shtml">Fluid Multi-Pseudonymity</a></p>  <p>One of the discussions at <a href="https://projectvrm.org/">VRM Day</a> caused me to think about a feature of digital relationships I hadn't considered before. Someone said that if you think about a graph with people (or things, organizations, and so on) as the nodes, the relationships are the edges, like so:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a4c39e7-82f9-4e61-9d8a-0f5470747980.heic">   </a>Bi-directional relationship <p>In this figure Alice and Bob have a bi-directional relationship. This is how I've normally thought about it and how I'd have drawn it. But in today's discussion, someone said that the relationship is shared and that Alice and Bob both control it. But I realized that viewpoint is too simple. Specifically, Alice and Bob each have a different perspective of that relationship and will use it separately.</p><p>For example, imagine that Alice is the cashier at a grocery store and Bob is a customer. Alice gives great service, so Bob seeks her out when he shops. Alice on the other hand has no particular recollection of Bob from encounter to encounter. For Alice, the relationship is ephemeral, but for Bob, it's longer term. The nature of each relationship is different. So, we might look at it like this[1]:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49645230-8318-48ca-95db-bcaed2f53dd6.heic">   </a>Two, uni-directional relationships <p>But after discussing it some more, I realized that these relationships aren't independent. They're entangled like this:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61aa3d80-6435-4406-b78f-6eb924e0c59b.heic">   </a>Entangled relationships <p>In the example I gave above, as Bob seeks out Alice more and more, Alice might come to recognize him and call him by name, changing the nature of her relationship with Bob. And that may influence the nature of Bob's relationship with Alice. Over time, these interactions influence both relationships. So, while Alice and Bob both have control over their relationship with the other, actions by one influence the other.</p><p>I frequently say that we don't build identity systems to manage identities, but rather to manage relationships. The problem with contemporary identity systems is that they are all one sided, controlled by one party—almost always a company. As I've said before, people are not <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2022/01/web3_and_digital_embodiment.shtml">digital embodied</a> and thus have no good way to manage their online relationships. As we strive to build better digital identity systems, I think it's paramount that we build systems that provide people with tools that embody them and provide them with the ability to operationalize their online relationships.

<p>This article shows how to implement a secure .NET 8 Blazor Web application using OpenID Connect and security headers with CSP nonces. The NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders nuget package is used to implement the security headers and OpenIddict is used to implement the OIDC server.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/BlazorWebOidc">https://github.com/damienbod/BlazorWebOidc</a></p>



<p>OpenIddict is used as the identity provider and an OpenID connect client is setup to allow an OpenID Connect confidential code flow PKCE client. The Web application is a server rendered application using Blazor server components implemented using Blazor Web, ASP.NET Core and .NET 8.</p>







<p></p>



 Step 1: Init solution from the .NET Blazor samples 



<p>The solution was created using the Blazor samples from Microsoft. The .NET 8 BlazorWebAppOidc project was used to setup the solution.</p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/dotnet/blazor-samples/tree/main/8.0/BlazorWebAppOidc">https://github.com/dotnet/blazor-samples/tree/main/8.0/BlazorWebAppOidc</a></p>



<p>The code sample implements the client profile parts and the CSRF protection. Login and Logout plumbing is also implemented.</p>



 Step 2: Switch the OpenID Connect server 



<p>OpenIddict is used as the identity provider and so the OIDC client set up needs to be changed. The program file was updated and the OpenID Connect Microsoft Entra ID client was replaced with the OpenIddict client. The client on the server is setup directly in the worker class in the Openiddict server. Both of the setups must match. The client uses an OpenID Connect confidential client with code flow and PKCE.</p>



<p></p>


  builder.Services.AddAuthentication(OIDC_SCHEME)
    .AddOpenIdConnect(OIDC_SCHEME, options =&gt;
    {
        // From appsettings.json, keyvault, user-secrets
        // "OpenIDConnectSettings": {
        //  "Authority": "https://localhost:44318",
        //  "ClientId": "oidc-pkce-confidential",
        //  "ClientSecret": "--secret-in-key-vault-user-secrets--"
        // },
        builder.Configuration.GetSection("OpenIDConnectSettings").Bind(options);

        options.SignInScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
        options.ResponseType = OpenIdConnectResponseType.Code;

        options.SaveTokens = true;
        options.GetClaimsFromUserInfoEndpoint = true;
        options.MapInboundClaims = false; // Remove Microsoft mappings
        options.TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
        {
            NameClaimType = "name"
        };
    })
    .AddCookie();
  


<p></p>



<p>Note: You could also use the OpenIddict client packages to implement the client. I like to use the defaults.</p>



 Step 3: Disable WASM mode 



<p>Any web application should protect the session, not just implement authentication using an OIDC server. One of the most important browser protection is the CSP header and a good CSP uses a nonce. Blazor Web using WASM does not support this and so this must be disabled. Remove the WASM part from the middleware.</p>



<p>In the program.cs, update Blazor Web to:</p>


  builder.Services.AddRazorComponents()
    .AddInteractiveServerComponents();
  


<p>and</p>


  app.MapRazorComponents&lt;App&gt;()
    .AddInteractiveServerRenderMode()
    .AddAdditionalAssemblies(
            typeof(BlazorWebAppOidc.Client._Imports).Assembly);
  


<p>Remove the WASM usage in the UI components. Switch to InteractiveServer mode.</p>


      &lt;HeadOutlet @rendermode="InteractiveServer" /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;Routes @rendermode="InteractiveServer" /&gt;
  


 Step 4: Add CSP nonce middleware 



<p>The CSP nonce can be used in Blazor (Server) components with some extra effort because the Blazor components cannot read the HTTP headers from the responses. The CircuitHandler class can be used for this. A BlazorNonceService class can be created to add the nonce. This class inherits the CircuitHandler implementation.</p>


  using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Server.Circuits;

namespace BlazorWebAppOidc.CspServices;

/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Original src: https://github.com/javiercn/BlazorWebNonceService
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
public class BlazorNonceService : CircuitHandler, IDisposable
{
    private readonly PersistentComponentState _state;
    private readonly PersistingComponentStateSubscription _subscription;

    public BlazorNonceService(PersistentComponentState state)
    {
        if (state.TryTakeFromJson("nonce", out string? nonce))
        {
            if (nonce is not null)
            {
                Nonce = nonce;
            }
            else
            {
                throw new InvalidOperationException(
                         "Nonce can't be null when provided");
            }
        }
        else
        {
            _subscription = state.RegisterOnPersisting(PersistNonce);
        }

        _state = state;
    }

    public string? Nonce { get; set; }

    private Task PersistNonce()
    {
        _state.PersistAsJson("nonce", Nonce);
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }

    public void SetNonce(string nonce)
    {
        ArgumentException.ThrowIfNullOrWhiteSpace(nonce);

        if (Nonce != null)
        {
            throw new InvalidOperationException("Nonce already defined");
        }

        Nonce = nonce;
    }

    public void Dispose() =&gt; ((IDisposable)_subscription)?.Dispose();
}
  


<p>A NonceMiddleware ASP.NET Core middleware service can now be used to read the nonce from the headers and set this in the BlazorNonceService CircuitHandler implementation. NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders is used to implement the security headers and if a CSP nonce is created, the NETESCAPADES_NONCE  http header is set.</p>


  namespace BlazorWebAppOidc.CspServices;

public class NonceMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;

    public NonceMiddleware(RequestDelegate next)
    {
        _next = next;
    }

    public async Task Invoke(HttpContext context, 
              BlazorNonceService blazorNonceService)
    {
        var success = context.Items
                  .TryGetValue("NETESCAPADES_NONCE", out var nonce);
        if (success &amp;&amp; nonce != null)
        {
            blazorNonceService.SetNonce(nonce.ToString()!);
        }
        await _next.Invoke(context);
    }
}
  


<p>The middleware for the nonce is added to the ASP.NET Core services.</p>


  builder.Services.TryAddEnumerable(
     ServiceDescriptor.Scoped&lt;CircuitHandler, BlazorNonceService&gt;(sp =&gt;
     sp.GetRequiredService&lt;BlazorNonceService&gt;()));

builder.Services.AddScoped&lt;BlazorNonceService&gt;();
  


<p>Use the middleware is in the ASP.NET Core pipelines.</p>


  app.UseMiddleware&lt;NonceMiddleware&gt;();
  


 Step 5: Add HTTP browser security headers 



<p>The NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders nuget package is used to implement the security headers as best possible for this type of application. The SecurityHeadersDefinitions class implements this. CSP nonces are configuration as well as other security headers.</p>


  namespace BlazorWebAppOidc;

public static class SecurityHeadersDefinitions
{
    public static HeaderPolicyCollection GetHeaderPolicyCollection(
        bool isDev, string? idpHost)
    {
        ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull(idpHost);

        var policy = new HeaderPolicyCollection()
            .AddFrameOptionsDeny()
            .AddContentTypeOptionsNoSniff()
            .AddReferrerPolicyStrictOriginWhenCrossOrigin()
            .AddCrossOriginOpenerPolicy(builder =&gt; builder.SameOrigin())
            .AddCrossOriginResourcePolicy(builder =&gt; builder.SameOrigin())
            .AddCrossOriginEmbedderPolicy(builder =&gt; builder.RequireCorp())
            .AddContentSecurityPolicy(builder =&gt;
            {
                builder.AddObjectSrc().None();
                builder.AddBlockAllMixedContent();
                builder.AddImgSrc().Self().From("data:");
                builder.AddFormAction().Self().From(idpHost);
                builder.AddFontSrc().Self();
                builder.AddBaseUri().Self();
                builder.AddFrameAncestors().None();

                builder.AddStyleSrc()
                    .UnsafeInline()
                    .Self();

                // due to Blazor
                builder.AddScriptSrc()
                      .WithNonce()
                      .UnsafeEval() // due to Blazor WASM
                      .StrictDynamic()
                      .OverHttps()
                      .UnsafeInline(); // only a fallback for older browsers
            })
            .RemoveServerHeader()
            .AddPermissionsPolicy(builder =&gt;
            {
                builder.AddAccelerometer().None();
                builder.AddAutoplay().None();
                builder.AddCamera().None();
                builder.AddEncryptedMedia().None();
                builder.AddFullscreen().All();
                builder.AddGeolocation().None();
                builder.AddGyroscope().None();
                builder.AddMagnetometer().None();
                builder.AddMicrophone().None();
                builder.AddMidi().None();
                builder.AddPayment().None();
                builder.AddPictureInPicture().None();
                builder.AddSyncXHR().None();
                builder.AddUsb().None();
            });

        if (!isDev)
        {
            // maxage = one year in seconds
            policy.AddStrictTransportSecurityMaxAgeIncludeSubDomains();
        }

        policy.ApplyDocumentHeadersToAllResponses();

        return policy;
    }
}
  


<p></p>



<p>The security headers are added using middleware as early as possible in the pipeline. I add the headers for all requests.</p>


  app.UseSecurityHeaders(
    SecurityHeadersDefinitions.GetHeaderPolicyCollection(
        app.Environment.IsDevelopment(),
        app.Configuration["OpenIDConnectSettings:Authority"]));
  


<p>The CSP nonce can now be used in the Blazor components and scripts can only be read using the nonce. Unsecure scripts or unsecure inline scripts should never be read anywhere in a browser application.</p>


  &lt;pre class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code"&gt; &lt;a href="http://_framework/blazor.web.js"&gt;http://_framework/blazor.web.js&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

@code
{
    /// &lt;summary&gt;
    /// Original src: https://github.com/javiercn/BlazorWebNonceService
    /// &lt;/summary&gt;
    [CascadingParameter] HttpContext Context { get; set; } = default!;

    protected override void OnInitialized()
    {
        var nonce = GetNonce();
        if (nonce != null)
        {
            BlazorNonceService.SetNonce(nonce);
        }
    }

    public string? GetNonce()
    {
        if (Context.Items.TryGetValue("nonce", out var item) 
            &amp;&amp; item is string nonce and not null)
        {
            return nonce;
        }

        return null;
    }
}&lt;/pre&gt;
  


<p></p>



<p>The applications can be started and the authentication and the session protection can be validated. Using the WASM mode in Blazor Web requires a weaker security setup and you need to disable the CSP nonces. This is not a good idea.</p>

 第２章：日本のバーチャル世界を研究したい 



 
 ミラさんがバーチャル世界の研究を始めたのは４年前 



 研究調査で驚きを持って知った言葉「バ美肉」（バーチャル美少女受肉）男性が美少女キャラを持つときに使われることば 



 「受肉」には西洋では宗教的な意味があるが、バ美肉たちは宗教に全く関心がない。そこにミラさんは興味を惹かれた。 



 調査をすると驚くべきことがわかった。男性のおよそ８割が美少女キャラクターを使っている
 
 女性　78.3% 



 男性　15.2% 



 その他　6.5% 
 
 



 その見た目には大きな特徴：アニメに出るような可愛い女の子。これに対して西洋では、クールでセクシー。カワイイとは違って強い女性という印象を受ける。

 ミラさん：わたしは西洋で育ち、女性として美しくエレガントでありたいと思っていた。なぜ日本の男性はカワイイと言われたいのか。西洋人としてこの異なる視点をもっと理解したいと思います。

 20世紀初頭に一つの学問領域として確立。
 
 クロード・レヴィ・ストロース 



 ルース・ベネディクト 



 梅棹忠夫 
 
 



 机に向かうだけではなく、現地に赴き直接人と触れあるフィールドワークという手法で人間とは何かを探求する学問 



 人類学者は世界各地の民族を訪ね、彼らとともに暮らし、彼らの生活をつぶさに観察、自分の属する社会と比較することで、その共通点や違い、多様性を明らかにしてきた 



 バーチャル世界という新たな地平 



 最初SNSを使いバ美肉たちに話しかけたが、部外者であるわたしは信用されなかった。わたしが西洋人であり女性だったから。そこで、ミラさんは人類学の手法であるフィールドワークを使ってバ美肉たちに接近。自分のアバターを作ることは重要だった。バーチャル世界で彼らの信用を得ることができたから。 



 アバターを纏うことでバ美肉たちと同じ目線に立ち直接ふれあい始めたリュドミラ 



 ときには一緒にライブ配信を行い、オリジナル曲の英訳を買って出た 



 そして１年ほどかけて、徐々にコミュニティの中に入っていった 
 
 
 



 第３章　声までカワイイってどういうこと？ 



 
 両声類<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2024/04/5723/#easy-footnote-bottom-4-5723" title="男性でありながら女性の声を出せるなど、両性の声を出せる人">4</a>の紹介
 
 声は男性のままか音声変換器を使うのが一般的 



 しかし、<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@johnko_amachi">あまちじょんこ(Youtuber @johnko_amachi</a> X: <a href="https://twitter.com/johnko20100711">@johnko20100711</a>) などは自らの超絶技巧で声を変える。 



 中の人は、じょんアニキ。
 
 めざすもの：天真爛漫で無邪気で、こういう小さい子っているよねという女の子をしたい。 



 高い声にするだけだと、男の人の高い声になってしまう。声は楽器と一緒なので楽器の形を変えてあげる。そうやって音質を変えて、その上で音の高さを変える。両方が合わさってじょんこの声になる 



 ２年かけ、理想の可愛い声を獲得した 



 「別の自分になれるってめちゃくちゃ楽しくて。で、なんかそれで、ただ楽しいということを突き詰めていく。天才じゃないから頑張るしかない。」 



 カワイイ動きのトレーニング。いざやっていむと難しい。ちいさい子の気持ちになって動かないといけない。たとえば、歩くときに右の足を出すと右に重心がよってしまう。これを繰り返すとふらふら見える。このふらふらした動きが、見ている人からしたら守ってあげたいというので可愛く見える。 
 
 



 ミラさん
 
 歩く時にかわいいを意識したことがなかったのでとてもおもしろいと思った 



 前は日本の男性といえばサラリーマンかオタクという表層的なステレオタイプなイメージしかなかった。しかし、研究をしてみると、日本人男性の多様性や日本文化の寛容性を知りとても面白いということがわかってきた 
 
 
 
 



 ミラさんの生い立ちの説明
 
 ロシア生れ。１２歳でスイスに移住。フランス語の勉強に日本の漫画。<a href="https://amzn.to/3xsVDqz">「天使禁猟区」</a><a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2024/04/5723/#easy-footnote-bottom-5-5723" title="<a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E7%94%B1%E8%B2%B4%E9%A6%99%E7%B9%94%E9%87%8C/e/B0034P2S76/ref=dp_byline_cont_ebooks_1&quot;>由貴香織里</a>「天使禁猟区」（白泉社）<a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3vRNefW&quot;>https://amzn.to/3vRNefW</a>">5</a>。今までこのような美しい絵を見たことがなかったので新しい世界が開けた。 



 27際のときに日本文化を学ぶためにジュネーブ大学の修士課程に。 



 論文を発表「Babiniku」<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2024/04/5723/#easy-footnote-bottom-6-5723" title="Bredikhina, Liudmila. (2022) Babiniku: what lies behind the virtual performance.

 日本の伝統芸能の一つである歌舞伎の女形と同様に男性が美少女キャラクターを演じる類似点 



 人形浄瑠璃とアバターをあやつるバ美肉の共通性など日本の伝統文化を通してバ美肉を考察した論文は大学から学術賞を受けた 



 日本の文化はとても興味深く、趣味と実益を兼ねた研究をしたいと考えた 
 
 



 ブレンダ・マーフィー教授
 
 「彼女の研究の魅力は西洋で主流ではない”日本文化”に着目している点です」 



 バーチャル人類学はとても新しい分野であり、彼女はグローバルな文化への挑戦者といえる 
 
 



 リュドミラが来日するのはこれで６度目。街に行けば目につくのは美少女キャラクター。看板や飲食店など町のいたるところで見かける。美少女キャラクターは秋葉原だけでなく日本文化で不可欠な存在 



 アニメや漫画の専門店に立ち寄り、次々に新しいものが生まれる日本のサブカルチャーもミラさんにとって研究の一環 
 
 
 



 第４章　美少女キャラに会いたい 



 
 アイドルVTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NoraCat0415">のらきゃっと</a> (@NoraCat0415 ch. 登録者86000人以上）。ファンネーム「ねずみさん」 



 これを生み出したのが<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PIMR">「のらねこP」(@PIMR</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/VR_Produce_Nora">X: @VR_Produce_Nora</a>)インタビュー
 
 のらきゃっとにガチ恋だと言っているファンとの関係についておしえて
 
 のらちゃんがちょっとドジなところもあってでも強くて可愛くてというのはファンがそう思っているから作られたという部分が多くて、ネズミさんたちがのらきゃっとという存在にそうあってほしいという願いのもとに作られたのでファンからの影響はとても強い 
 
 



 のらきゃっとがファンから可愛いと言われるとどう感じるか
 
 娘が公園で仲の良い友達と遊んでいて幸せそうだと親が感じるのに似ている 
 
 



 のらきゃっとが生まれて人生は変わったか？
 
 今までの仕事に行って帰ってきて家で寝るだけという生活でそんなに友達もいないというような人生から、本当に楽しく話せる友達が10倍以上に増えた。誰かと話したいときに話せるので寂しいと思う瞬間がなくなった 
 
 



 かわいい美少女になれるって最高ですね「みんななれる〜」 



 ファンから求められることで美少女キャラはよりかわいくくなり、その美少女を生み出した彼の生活も豊かにしている。今日いちばん重要な発見だった 
 
 
 



 第５章　美少女になる理由を知りたい 



 
 バーチャル美少女とファンとの交流はさらに進化。現実世界のファンが集まる店。友人のバ美肉が出演すると聞き訪ねた。「新宿ねむバー」 



 バーチャル美少女ねむさん(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@nemchan_nel">Youtube @nemchan_nel</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/nemchan_nel">X @nemchan_nel</a> )＝<a href="https://amzn.to/3VUkM7X">『メタバース進化論』（技術評論社）</a>の著者で、ミラさんの研究の頼もしい協力者 



 ミラさん：「直接あって美少女やメタバースとか私達が情熱を注いでいることについてもっと話そう」 



 ねむさん：「楽しそう。たくさん話すのを楽しみにしてるよ」 



 ミラさん：「ではリアル世界で」 



 ねむはプライベート時間の殆どをメタバースで過ごし、専門書<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2024/04/5723/#easy-footnote-bottom-7-5723" title="『メタバース進化論』（技術評論社）<a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3VUkM7X&quot;>https://amzn.to/3VUkM7X</a> ">7</a>を出版するほどこの世界について考え続けてきた人物。 



 ミラさん：直接美少女キャラクターになる理由を訊いてみたい 



 匿名で活動したいというねむさんの希望により映像と音声を加工しています→モザイクの大きさはかなり調整したらしい 



 SNSを通じ知り合ったのは4年前。ねむさんとはメタバースユーザの生活実態を一緒に調査したことも。 



 ミラさんによるねむさんへのインタビュー 



 初めてねむになったときどう思ったの？
 
 すごく恥ずかしかった。 



 罪悪感〜違う自分になるというのが悪いことをしているような感覚だった 



 でもだんだんいつもの自分では出てこないような言葉が口から出てきた 
 
 



 美少女になると自己表現も変わるということか？
 
 「現実の自分だとカッコつけちゃうのかな」 



 「そこまで心揺れ動かない結構冷静な人間だと自分のことを思っていたけど、ねむちゃんのときはそういうのから開放されてもっと自由に表現できる」 
 
 



 あなたにとっての美少女ってどういう存在なのか？
 
 “カワイイ”という概念を具現化した存在が美少女キャラクターだと思っている 



 肩書とか現実世界のしがらみを剥ぎ取ると人間の本質ってすごくカワイイ。魂って実はカワイイと思っていて、カワイイはその人の本質を褒めている気がする。 



 自信になるというか、ありのままでちゃんと意味があるんだと思える気がする 
 
 



 なぜ日本人男性が美少女になりたいと思うのか。その答えを求めてフィールドワークを続けてきたミラさんの今考える結論
 
 日本人男性は美少女になりカワイイを獲得することでストレスから開放される。 



 なぜならカワイイは失敗しても許されるし責任を負わなくていいからです。 



 私は日本文化から生まれたカワイイに可能性を感じました 



 しかし私は人類学者としてコミュニティを一般化するのではなく、これからも多くの人たちの声に耳を傾けたいと思っています 
 
 
 



<p>エンド：若き人類学者が日本のバーチャル世界に分け入っていく</p>



 考察 



 アイデンティティとバ美肉 



<p>アイデンティティという言葉は番組の中に出て来ませんが、多くの発言は「アイデンティティ」関連だとわたしの中では整理されました。たとえば、じょんこさんの「別の自分になれるってめちゃくちゃ楽しくて。で、なんかそれで、ただ楽しいということを突き詰めていく。」という発言は、現実社会の仕事だとか交友関係という既存のコンテキストを超えた新たなコンテキストでの自我の確立とその表出（自観するアイデンティティの表出）およびそれがコミュニティ内で他の人に観測されるもののフィードバック（他観）という関係性の享受から幸福感を得ているように見えます。（自観と他観のあたりは、<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2011/06/1124/">「非技術者のためのデジタルアイデンティティ入門」</a>をご参照ください）</p>



<p>類似のことは、ねむさんの「（最初ねむになったとき）すごく恥ずかしかった。罪悪感〜違う自分になるというのが悪いことをしているような感覚だった。でもだんだんいつもの自分では出てこないような言葉が口から出てきた。」「ねむちゃんのときはそういうのから開放されてもっと自由に表現できる。」という言葉にも出てきます。</p>



<p>一方、のらねこPの「のらちゃんがちょっとドジなところもあってでも強くて可愛くてというのはファンがそう思っているから作られたという部分が多くて、ネズミさんたちがのらきゃっとという存在にそうあってほしいという願いのもとに作られたのでファンからの影響はとても強い。」という発言は、自観と他観のズレの最小化を、表出する属性の調整によって他観の方を変えて行うという「通常」のやり方とは逆で、他観の方に自観をあわせてしまうというアプローチに見えます。根源的自我に他観を合わせに行くのではなく、自我の方を調整してしまうわけですね。ただ、これが本当に自分の自我だとかなり心理的負荷が大きくなってくるのではないかと思われます。心理的負荷を減らすには、自分の中からその人格を外だししてしまって客観化してしまうことが必要であるようにも思えます。</p>



<p>このあたりが、のらねこPの「娘が公園で仲の良い友達と遊んでいて幸せそうだと親が感じるのに似ている」という発言からも表出されているように感じられました。</p>



<p>ここの部分で、ミラさんは「ファンから求められることで美少女キャラはよりかわいくくなり、その美少女を生み出した彼の生活も豊かにしている。今日いちばん重要な発見だった」と述べています。</p>



 免罪符としては機能しない美少女キャラクターとプライバシー 



<p>次に検討してみたいのが、ミラさんの「日本人男性は美少女になりカワイイを獲得することでストレスから開放される。なぜならカワイイは失敗しても許されるし責任を負わなくていいから。」という発言です。わたしの解釈違いかもしれませんが、カワイイが免罪符的に機能するので、日本人男性はカワイイを獲得したいと言っているように聞こえます。「日本人男性は」としているので、この「カワイイ」の概念とその通用する範囲が日本にまず限定されているのだろうということは想像できます。そのうえで「カワイイ」が免罪符的に機能するのかと言うと、これはちょっと難しいところだと思っています。</p>



<p>「カワイイ」を体現するものとしては、いわゆるアイドルVTuberなどがいると思います。ところが、その免罪符を持っているはずの彼女たちは、時として誹謗中傷されたりコミュニティから叩かれ、「卒業」を余儀なくされたりしているのは、このあたりをちょっと追っている人ならよくご存知のことと思います。もし「カワイイ」が免罪符として機能するならばこういうことは起きないと思うのです。</p>



<p>おそらく理想としての「カワイイ」には人々の期待がつまっていて、その期待を裏切ると叩かれるという構図があるのではないかとも思えます。つまり「カワイイ」が免罪符として機能するわけではない。ある意味、「”カワイイ”という概念を具現化した存在としての美少女キャラクター」は現代の巫女であり、古代と同じく、期待を裏切ったときにはスケープゴートにされる存在だと言えるかもしれません。で、わたしはスケープゴートって作ってはいけないと思うんですよね。</p>



<p>現代の巫女がスケープゴート化してしまう原因の多くは、コンテキスト外の情報の当該コンテキストへの混入です。たとえば、誰かからのチャットが画面に映り込んでしまったとか、他の人の声が混入してしまったとか、自分の顔が反射で映り込んでしまったとかですね。今後は他のワールドでの行動が当該ワールドにレポーティングされてしまうというような形の情報混入も起きてくることでしょう。場合によっては悪意の人が監視用のキャラクターを各所に配置して意図的にこれをやってくることも考えられます。中の人と、その人が運用する異なるアバターの名寄せとかもこの中に入ってきます。</p>



<p>番組の中でねむさんは「匿名で活動したい」としてモザイクをかけて声も変えて登場していますが、これも望まない名寄せであるとか情報の混入を防ぐ取り組みの一環と整理することもできます。</p>



<p>こうしたことをどうやって防ぐかとか取り締まっていくかなどが、メタバースにおけるプライバシーの尊重という意味では重要性を増してくると思われます。メタバースプライバシーの国際標準作成作業が始まっている背景でもあります。</p>



 しがらみを削ぎ落とした存在としての「ありのままの自分＝美少女キャラクター」 



<p>さて、ではなぜ日本人男性はバ美肉化するのか？上記のことを勘案すると、ミラさんのいう「日本人男性は美少女になりカワイイを獲得することでストレスから開放される。なぜならカワイイは失敗しても許されるし責任を負わなくていいから。」というのはちょっと違いそうです。</p>



<p>番組内でねむさんは「”カワイイ”という概念を具現化した存在が美少女キャラクターだと思っている。肩書とか現実世界のしがらみを剥ぎ取ると人間の本質ってすごくカワイイ。魂って実はカワイイと思っていて、カワイイはその人の本質を褒めている気がする。自信になるというか、ありのままでちゃんと意味があるんだと思える気がする。」とおっしゃっておられます。現実世界のしがらみを剥ぎ取った人の本質は「カワイイ」であり、そのありのままの自分の自我「自観」を表出すると、日本文化においては美少女になるということでしょうか。そうかもしれません。なにせ、８割近くのひとがそうあろうとするのですから。</p>



<p>番組では、各被取材者ごとに数時間のインタビューがあったのがそれぞれ５分くらいにまとめられてしまっているようです。削ぎ落とされたものの中に、このあたりに光を当ててくれる発言も多くあったことでしょう。その意味で、アフタートークも準備されているようなので、それに期待したいと思います。</p>

<p>Now for something entirely different. I write only occasionally on a topic of interest to me, verifiable credentials. Today it is something entirely different, my career. Most specifically, on how it may be time for a refocus. A movement from software development life-cycle process back toward a new more technical focus,&nbsp;AI.</p><p>I have, in some ways, refocused my career a couple of times. It wasn’t a full restart or anything; just moving into new directions within software development. Some were more a natural progressions than a refocus. This time it would certainly be a&nbsp;refocus.</p> What I do and what I have&nbsp;done? <p>For the last several years I have been a software technical release manager focused on not only getting software out the door but on process improvement. That is not where I started my career. It all started as a system admin, then a programmer, then getting involved in migrations and software develpment for mitigating Y2K, on to a software team lead. Then came the first refocus, I got deeply invested in a new Microsoft product Team Foundation Server. This took me down a fun rabbit hole where I spent some years consulting on implementations and use of the product. I spent a few years of my consulting as a Micrsoft MVP on the product, which was very rewarding. Ultimately, with a focus on version control, automated builds and deploys, and release processes with the product and in general, I made the next refocus. I moved into release management. Decidely less technical, but something I have now enjoyed for a number of years. I find the cross-functional nature rewarding and plenty of opportunity to still practice process improvement.</p> Why the consideration of a&nbsp;refocus? <p>I see it as a dying domain. I have found that the role is late to join organizations and more easily released from those same organizations. In my experience, companies find unexpected value in the role and can really enjoy having the “glue” bring higher quality and improved flow to production and beyond, but “enjoy” is too much of an operative word here. When belts are tightened it is one of the first roles to go — seen as a luxury not a requirement. I also see diminishing new opportunities in the marketplace. All this places downward pressure on compensation. Additionally, upward progression from the role is often difficult. So it may be time for a full refocus,&nbsp;again.</p> Too technical for the&nbsp;role? <p>It wasn’t too long ago I was told as a final feedback for a failed pursuit of an open release management position:</p><blockquote>You are too technical.</blockquote><p>Hmmm… I knew what they meant, but I had never had my quals work against me- not that I know of. Most find it to be a boon. It made me think. With all the considerations of why there might need to be a refocus, is it time to shift my momentum?</p> Where to&nbsp;next? <p>I really enjoy what I do and would hate to give it up but the writing might be on the wall. So, as I survey the landscape, I say to myself “what might be next”. Where is the best opportunity to delve into new things and make an impact for organizations? Is it the AI domain? Can I go from zero to hero? What does that look like? How long would it take and what path is there? I see a lot of potential in Microsoft’s Azure AI offerings and the ones that will inevtiably come down the line. Plus, I have a long history in the Microsoft stack. Let’s see where the next few years take me. Regardless of anything, I’ll certainly be digging deeper into the practical applications and implementations of the technology all why continuing my enjoyable current role in software life&nbsp;cycle.</p> Back to a common&nbsp;topic <p>Now, if I can come up with an AI realm play that ties in verifiable, portable, credentials. What will be bigger in the future than identity and AI?&nbsp;Nothing.</p>

 In a story on “<a href="https://medium.com/@dkelts.id/ripping-ids-should-go-the-way-of-cds-49fec9206492">Ripping IDs Should Go the Way of CDs</a>”, I wrote about the questionable accuracy, usability, and privacy of “ripping” analog IDs into the digital space — a/k/a Mobile Know Your Customer (mKYC). Now I‘ll analyze the “ $1 cost problem” and you’ll see why important steps in mKYC are being&nbsp;skipped. Analog to Digital. Cost, accuracy, usability, and privacy problems of Mobile ID Verification (image <a href="https://www.cidaas.com/autoident-cidaas-id-validator/">cidaas.com</a>)<p>Services that require identity verification have become increasingly dependent on “scan the front, scan the back, take a selfie, match” for everything from renting a sidewalk scooter to opening bank accounts to provisioning your mobile driver’s license. The cost of inaccuracy in each situation varies greatly. The practical amount of money to spend within these use cases doesn’t — from 0 to 25 cents. Yet most services cost $1. Startups eat the difference hoping the future cost will go down (sorry, it won’t). Many businesses eliminate steps to keep costs down but still roll out a high-demand feature. Avoid offering mobile services that depend on ID and you fall behind. Do it, and accept the risk of fraudulent inputs.</p><p>There are both financial risk mitigation use cases and government identity use cases that are currently utilizing mKYC. I’d like to separate these concepts (read to the end to see&nbsp;why).</p><blockquote>Note: I do not use the overloaded term document verification. I specifically split document verification into two distinct steps: document authentication (is it from a trusted issuer) and document validation (is the data on it accurate and the account behind it still valid). (See also <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63.html#sec3">definitions NIST 800–63</a>). Both of these would be resolved with digital government-signed identity documents.</blockquote> Cost Analysis of&nbsp;mKYC <blockquote>Note: I invite those with more insider knowledge of the costs of IDV to connect with me to correct my educated summary of costs&nbsp;below.</blockquote><p>There are <a href="https://medium.com/@dkelts.id/ripping-ids-should-go-the-way-of-cds-49fec9206492">at least 10 mKYC i</a>ssues that negatively impact user experience, accuracy, and privacy. mKYC is a technology where we haven’t yet been able to achieve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_by_design">Privacy by Design</a> Principle #4 of full functionality without zero-sum tradeoffs. It’s still cost vs. accuracy vs. user experience vs. privacy (spoiler alert: cost wins). Doing analog-to-digital, this won’t ever&nbsp;change.</p> The Document <a href="https://www.idwise.com/glossary/document-authentication/">Authentication</a> Cost&nbsp;Problem <blockquote>Is the physical document real or fake? How much does it cost to accurately know?</blockquote><p>The cost problem here is simply explained. In physical documents, the goal of winning the card security feature <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_document_forgery">race against fraudsters</a> was to make it expensive, in dollars and knowledge, to produce fake IDs. So cards have proprietary visual, tool-based (8x magnify, multi-spectral lighting), and forensic (destroy the card to detect) <a href="https://www.aamva.org/getmedia/19072a17-e9f2-45e0-975f-5e00588cb3f8/Design-Principles-and-Guidelines-for-Secure-DLID-Cards.pdf">security features</a> built into their structure, printing, and lamination. Digitally created for analog use... At great expense, including <a href="https://patents.google.com/?inventor=Robert+Jones&amp;assignee=Morphotrust&amp;oq=Robert+Jones+Morphotrust">admirable IP</a>, layered over time… but the fraudsters still caught up, able to replicate lower-cost visual features (and therefore make them acceptable by every bar bouncer on&nbsp;earth).</p><p>This gave rise to the supremacy of tool-based authentication for high-risk use cases — use an 8x loupe magnifier; combine white, UV, and IR lights (multi-spectral) to detect secrets built or printed into the card; purposeful design flaws, raised surfaces… amazing technology! Until you try to scan and authenticate it with a white-light phone camera held by a human&nbsp;hand.</p> Now We Expect to Go Back from Analog to&nbsp;Digital? <p>Try to ingest a secure physical card back into the digital realm and you must try to detect all <a href="https://www.aamva.org/getmedia/19072a17-e9f2-45e0-975f-5e00588cb3f8/Design-Principles-and-Guidelines-for-Secure-DLID-Cards.pdf">three levels</a> of physical card security features with a hand-held camera designed for action photos and portraits taken at focal lengths much further away than human arm length. There’s no UV or IR light, no optical magnification, very few steady cams, and no foolproof UX coaching for a person who isn’t aware of what’s being detected.</p><p>Do you see where this is taking us? Massive cost, diminishing return, user friction, bad experience… dropoff. What do mKYC purchasers do? Turn features off to avoid paying for document authentication and user friction.</p> The Document <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a/proofing/">Validation</a> Cost&nbsp;Problem <p>Once you’ve scanned an ID document, extracted the data from the front with OCR, decoded the barcode from the back, and skipped sending it for document authentication (lol), you’re still left with a few questions…</p><blockquote>Is the document still valid? Is the identity data accurate? Are the attributes fresh or have they changed? Can I ask the <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63.html#def-and-acr">authoritative source</a> to validate them? How much does it cost me to perform that document data validation?</blockquote><p>If you want to establish the <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2018/NIST.IR.8112.pdf">provenance, accuracy, and freshness</a> of the data, you need to connect to the source that mitigates your risk&nbsp;level.</p><p>At the first level of reliability are “credible sources”. For example, data aggregators charge dimes and quarters for the service of validating data you collected against what they algorithmically believe to be accurate. It’s due diligence on your part. Whether you consider that credible depends on your level of risk versus the cost of&nbsp;service.</p><p>At the higher level of reliability are “authoritative sources” — the official issuers of identity documents. Who can connect? Mostly government and law enforcement. You can pay a quarter or two per record to validate data in privacy-preserving manners — yes/no on the accuracy of what you have versus looking up someone’s identity data using an identifier.</p><p>See the problem? It costs more just to validate than businesses should logically spend on the whole identity problem. And most don’t have&nbsp;access.</p><p>Then there’s the “use at your own risk” level of reliability of unofficial sources (not NIST-defined, surprisingly). The problem with using unofficial sources is that all our data was breached. Assume that to be true — zero trust. Check your mailbox for legal breach notices — confirmed. It’s cheaper to buy that data from the dark web than to use either a credible or authoritative source (if available to you). Advantage fraudsters… and the reason <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220420005041/en/Pindrop-Voice-Intelligence-Security-Report-Finds-Fraudsters-Passed-Knowledge-Based-Authentication-Questions-92-Percent-of-the-Time">fraudsters can pass Knowledge-Based Authentication</a> more easily than <a href="https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2022/04/190239-security-report-reveals-fraudsters-passed-knowledge-based-authentication-questions-92-of-the-time/">our memories</a>. Skip KBA as an alternative (please).</p><p>What’s the point? Eh, given the cost, you’ll skip the document validation step. And you skipped document authentication. So you’re left with having snapped an off-angle photo of that ID document so that you can crop the low-resolution face out of it (resplendent with holograms, security lines, watermarking, and reflective lamination) for biometric matching. Better set that False Accept Rate high enough to get a decent Match&nbsp;Score!</p><blockquote>Or you can just produce digital documents in the first place. (See #3&nbsp;below)</blockquote> Cost Consolidation <p>From what I see, there are some alternatives for us to start to win-win the zero-sum problem we are&nbsp;facing.</p> 1. Do this Once at High Cost/Accuracy and Reuse it at Lower&nbsp;Cost <p>If one analog-to-digital event can be run at a high level of identity assurance(IAL2 minimum) by an authoritative entity, and the event can be re-used, then we start to lower the repeated costs to all future entities. Perhaps then the cost-benefit ratio will make sense. Note that I said an “authoritative” entity and not a credible or trusted entity. I like banks. Banks act in trustworthy ways, perform due diligence when required, and have been willing to <a href="https://www.bankid.com/en/om-oss/historia">step to the forefront in many regions</a>. But if you require a “government-issued ID” for your use case, bank KYC isn’t that. Bank KYC is an <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63a/proofing/#identity-verification">Identity Verification</a> not a government signed&nbsp;ID.</p><p>A reusable identity solution should be a government-issued, privacy-protecting credential with user authentication and selective disclosure. You might look at <a href="https://www.mdlconnection.com/whatismdl/">mDL</a> as this, however, there’s no standardized mechanism for user authentication yet in <a href="https://medium.com/@dkelts.id/mobile-driver-licenses-mdl-how-to-use-iso-18013-5-5a1bbc1a37a3">ISO/IEC 18013–5 </a>or -7. Even without built-in user authentication, ingesting a digital mDL will short-circuit dozens of <a href="https://medium.com/@dkelts.id/ripping-ids-should-go-the-way-of-cds-49fec9206492">my list of 10 problems</a> (pun intended), increase accuracy, and lower cost while allowing fewer fraudulent documents through. That’s why NIST wants to solve this first <a href="https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/projects/digital-identities-mdl">through the&nbsp;NCCoE</a>.</p> 2. Separate Financial Risk Mitigation from Official&nbsp;Identity <p>Why this hasn’t happened yet confuses me. Yet we still call it “identity fraud” when criminals are using freely available identity data to perform “financial fraud”.</p><p>But seriously, scooter rentals don’t need my ID document, they need to know I can or will pay. Keep going and we will realize the ACLU’s dystopian <a href="https://www.aclu.org/wp-content/uploads/publications/20210913-digitallicense.pdf">over-identification state</a> (link will download PDF). None of us want&nbsp;that.</p><p>The solution Financial Services needs to look at is reusable <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/implement-passkeys-overview/">user authentication</a> against the KYC they or their partners already performed… without sharing identity attributes that won’t mitigate financial risk.</p> 3. Issue Digitally-Signed Originals <p>Better yet, just skip the analog to digital steps. Issue and accept digital birth certificates. Issue and accept Mobile or digital ID documents. If you’re not yet accepting digital mDLs,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mdlconnection.com/mdl-uses/">start</a>.</p><p>People in the (self-labeled) Self-Sovereign or Decentralized Identity spaces have created the nearly ideal architecture for issuing authoritatively signed, lightweight, digital birth certificates. So far, to my knowledge, only <a href="https://www.ica.gov.sg/documents/birth/birth_registration">Singapore</a> has jumped on this technology and is realizing the cost savings and accuracy. There’s still one privacy hole to close… whoever controls the distributed ledger can potentially see all authentication and validation requests against the ledger if they control the API layer. This is a solvable technical problem with the architectural concepts of blinding, brokerage, or anonymizing API access (rotating relying party identifiers). This is solvable <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/events/identeratiofficehours-usneedsat7178595199718158336/theater/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_event%3BeGWD2ndXQ7OcbijV17A0zQ%3D%3D">with policy</a> (link will open video) if not&nbsp;law.</p> 4. Put the User/Holder in Control of their Credentials and&nbsp;Data <p>When you provide the user (aka citizen, resident, digital subject, holder) with their document in digital form, they gain control over how they share it. <a href="https://eu-digital-identity-wallet.github.io/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/1.1.0/arf/">EU Digital Identity Wallets</a> are making progress. More importantly, the ease of sharing means that the recipient (relying party) doesn’t need to store identity attributes to mitigate their risk. Ask, verify, dispose. This is a concept of Interactive Information Privacy(TM) that I’ll write about more in the future and that I <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/DavidKelts/lessons-in-privacy-engineering-from-a-nation-scale-identity-system-connect-id">presented at Cloud Identity Summit in&nbsp;2017</a>.</p><blockquote>Don’t forget to put your reusable identity-proofing credential in that&nbsp;wallet.</blockquote> Call to&nbsp;Action <p>We want to stop “ripping IDs” just like we stopped ripping CDs when digital content services became ubiquitous. Digital Identity Services are the next frontier, but everybody is trying to solve everything everywhere all at once. I laid out 4 pathways above, each with existing possible solutions and a legitimate business model to make them self-sustaining. Let’s create actionable, cost-effective solutions to our “identity fraud” problems. The architects have done decent jobs… now the product, market, and business sides should capitalize in better ways than we are currently employing.</p>

 Introduction 
 
 I opened the meeting and introduced Devrim Gündüz. 
 
 Presentation 
 
 
<p>Thank you for the introduction. Going to talk about Yum and ZYpp dot
postgresql.org, these are the challenge for us, and the challenge of
making RPMs from extensions.</p>
 
 
<p>Work for <a href="https://www.enterprisedb.com" title="EDB: Open-Source, Enterprise Postgres Database Management">EDB</a> as Postgres expert, Postgres Major contributor responsible
for the Postgres Yum repo. If you’re using RPMs, I’m building them. I also
contribute to Rocky, SUSE, and Fedora Linux, proud Postgres community
member, live in London, and I’m also doing some DJing, so if I get fired I
have an extra job to do.</p>
 
 
<p>Agenda: Last year at PGConf.eu in Prague, I had 60 slides for 5 minutes,
so expect huge number of slides for today. I want to leave some time for
discussion discussion and questions.</p>
 
 
<p>I’m going to start with how it started back in the 2000s, talk about the
contents of the repos, which distributions we t because that’s another
challenge um how do we do the extension packaging how to RPM how to build
RPMs of an extension and how to update an extension RPM.</p>
 
 
<p>Then the horror story um when what happens when there’s a new Postgres
beta is out,  which is due in the next next month or so for Postgres 17.</p>
 
 
<p>Then we are going to speak about the extension maintainers,  problem for
us, and then the problems about relying on the external repos.</p>
 
 
<p>So if you have any questions please ask as soon as you can. I may not be
able to follow the chat during the presentation, but I’ll try as much as I
can.</p>
 
 
<p>So let’s talk about how it started. When I started using Linux in 1996 um
and Postgres in 1998, we always had Tom Lane and we had we had Lamar for
for who build built RPMs for RedHta Upstream. So they were just building
the distribution packages, nothing community. It was only specific to
RedHat — not RedHat Enterprise Linux but RedHat 3-4-5 — not the
non-enterprise version of RedHat back then, but it was called it Fedora
core back then, the first version was released in November
2003, which was another challenge for packaging</p>
 
 
<p>One of the problems with the distribution packaging was that it was
slightly behind the minor Postgres releases, sometimes major post releases</p>
 
 
<p>So that was one single Postgres version available for a given distro, say
Postgres 6.4 or something, 7.0, and multiple versions were not
available back then, and the minor version was slightly behind.</p>
 
 
<p>I started building packages for my laptop because I wanted to use Postgres
and not all versions wer available back then. So I started building
packages for my laptop and my server. They were based on the packaging of
Tom Lane and Lamar.</p>
 
 
<p>Then I uploaded them to my personal server and emailed the PG mailing
lists lists and said, “I’m running on own packages, use at your own risk.
This is just a rebuild of the upstream packages on the RedHat version that
I’m using or the Fedora version that I’m using. Up to you! This is a personal
project, nothing serious.”</p>
 
 
<p>So then then people started downloading them, and using them. There was no
signature, nothing official back then. Then Lamar said he didn’t have
enough time for the RPMs. He sent an email to the mailing lists and I said
Devrim is stepping up to the plate, and I did it. So that was I think in
2004, about which is about 20 years ago.</p>
 
 
<p>So 19 years ago we had the first domain, <code>postgresql.rpm.org</code>, and then we
had more packages. In 2007 we had the first repository RPM and then we had
yum.postgresql.org. This means that, starting 2007, this began to be the
official RPM repo of the community, which which was a good thing because
we could control everything under the Community.</p>
 
 
<p>I was living in Canada back then. We had the first RPM build farm —
instead of using my laptop and my VMs — we had the actual machine
back then.</p>
 
 
<p>In 2010 we had what was then called multiple postmaster support, which
means the parallel installation of the Postgres RPMs. That was a that was
a revolution because even still, the current Fedora or RedHat RPMs cannot
be installed in parallel. So if you want to install post 13, 14, 15, 16,
and 17 or whatever, it is available in the community repo. This is a great
feature because you may want to test or do something else. This is how
we how we started, 14 years ago we had this feature in the community repo.</p>
 
 
<p>Then next year we moved the repo to the community servers and unified the
spec files. Our builds are extremely simple — like you can start your
own builds in less than 10 minutes: five minutes for pulling the git repo
and then a few minutes for for a package. Extremely simple builds, and now
we are in 2024</p>
 
 
<p>Let’s talk about the contents, because we have four different contents for
the repo. The first one is the “common” repo. We call it “common” in the
repository config file. It has the RPMs that work across all Postgres
major releases. Let’s say pg_badger, or the ODBC driver, JDBC driver, or
GDAL for PostGIS. There’s  lots of stuff: Python packages, which are not
extensions but we like Patroni, which actually works for all Postgres
releases.</p>
 
 
<p>This was an effort to get rid of duplicates in the Postgres repo. I think we
shaved lots of gigabytes back then, and we still save a lot</p>
 
 
<p>Then, to address one of the topics of today’s talks, we have the
“non-common” RPMs. (These are the name of the directories, by the way.)
They are the RPMs which are Postgres version-specific, basically they are
extensions. Say <code>plpgsql_check</code> 15 or whatever. Lots of extensions are
there.</p>
 
 
<p>Then we have extras. They are not actually Postgres packages, they
shouldn’t be included in our repo by default, but many people actually
look for these packages because they they want to use Patroni and they
don’t have the supporting RPMs or supporting RTM RPMs, or they’re not
up-to-date.</p>
 
 
<p>I’m building a console, console-template, ETCD, HAProxy keepalived and
vip-manager. They are all open source, some of them are Go packages —
which, actually, I don’t build them, I just distribute the precompiled
binaries via the repo. So that makes easier for people to deploy the
packages.</p>
 
 
<p>And then we have the “non-free” repo. These are the packages that depend
on closed-source software like Oracle libraries, or that have license
restrictions. For example, ora2pg depends on Perl DBD::Oracle, oracle_fdw
depends on Oracle, pg_storm depends on Cuda Nvidia stuff, timescaledb-tsl
actually is Timescale DB with the TSL license, informix_fdw and db2_ftw.</p>
 
 
<p>So we have some non-free packages which actually depend on non-free stuff
as well. All of them are well-maintained: I’m trying to keep everything
up to date — like real up-to-date! That brings some problems but we
will get there.</p>
 
 
<p>We support RedHat Enterprise Linux and of course Rocky Linux. This year we
started supporting Alma Linux as well. Of course they are more or less
identical, but we test them, install, and support to verify the packages
in these three distributions.</p>
 
 
<p>We have x86_64 aarchm64, ppc64le, and RedHat 9, 8, and 7. We have
also RedHat 6 for Postgres 12, but it’s going to be killed by the end of
this year. We have Fedora, but only two major releases, which matches the
Fedora lifecycle. And SUSE —  my pain in the neck — um I’ll get there.</p>
 
 
<p>Since you all are here for extension packaging, let’s get there: what
happens for extension packaging.</p>
 
 
<p>First of all, we have the first extension, which is the in-core
extensions. They are delivered with the contrib sub-package, which matches
the directory name in The Postgres tarball. There are separate packages
for each major version, so p<code>ostgres15-contrib</code>, <code>postgres13-contrib</code>,
etc. These are the installation directories for each extension. We are
going to use those directories for the other [non-cre] extensions as well.</p>
 
 
<p>When we add a new extension to the repo, it’s going to use these
directories if they have a binary or if they an extension config file, if
the library or the mem files — all are going are all installed under
these directories. This magic is done by PGXS, which has been there
forever. We just provide initial stuff and then the rest is done by the
the PGXS magic. This is the base for a lot of the core extensions.</p>
 
 
<p>So what happens when we do non-common and non-free package? First of all,
they are distributed separately for each Postgres major version. Let’s go
back to the one of the extensions, say <code>plpgsql_check</code>. We have a separate
package for Postgres 14, a separate package for Postgres 15, 16, 13, and
12. If they build against all the supported Postgres versions, we have
separate packages for each.</p>
 
 
<p>Of course from time to time — as far as I remember Timescale DB does
this —- Timescale DB only supports Postgres 15 and 16 nowadays. So we
drop support for the older versions in the Git repo. But they are separate
packages; they are all installed in these directories along with the main
contrib package.</p>
 
 
<p>This is the naming convention that I use: <code>$extensionName_PGMajorVersion</code>.
Four or six years ago, some of the packages didn’t have an underscore
before the PG major version. It was a problem, so someone complained in
the hackers mailing list, and then I made the changes.</p>
 
 
<p>Currently all the previous and all the new packages have this naming
convention except a few packages like PostGIS — because in PostGIS we
have multiple versions of the same extension. let’s say we have PostGIS
3.3, 3.2, 3.4, 3.1, 3.0. We have combinations of each — I think we have
PostGIS 3.0 in some of the distributions but mostly PostGIS 3.1, 3.2, 3.3,
and 3.4, and then all the Postgres versions they support — A lot of
builds! So there are some exceptions where we have the extension name and
extension major version before the Postgres major version.</p>
 
 Jeremy S in chat: question: curious if you have thoughts about
relocatable rpm packages. ever tried? just best to avoid? 
 
 
 
<p>I have a question from Jeremy. This is a very basic question to answer.
This is actually forbidden by the packaging rules. The RPM packaging rules
forbid you to distribute or create relocatable RPM packages. We we stick
to the packaging guidelines, so this this cannot be done.</p>
 
 Jeremy S in chat: Thanks! (Didn’t realize packaging guidelines
forbid this) 
 
 
 
<p>Let’s talk about how we build extensions. Often our develop package is
enough: many of our packages just just rely on on Postgres itself. But of
course packages like PostGIS may depend on some other packages, like GDAL,
which requires lots of lots of extra dependencies as well. The most
problematic one is the GIS Stack: they need EPEL on RHEL and
RHEL and its derivatives.</p>
 
 
<p>There there has been a discussion in the past about whether should require
EPEL by default. The answer is “no,” because not all not all of our users
are installing, for example, the GIS stack or other packages. Most of our
users — not the majority of our users —- rely on the um rely on just
our repo.</p>
 
 
<p>On the other hand, in order to provide completeness for our users, I added
lots of python packages in the past to support Patroni — because the
upstream packages (I’m sorry not maybe upstream packages) were not enough.
The version wasn’t enough or maybe too low. So From some time to time I
add non Postgres-related packages to the repo just to support the Postgres
package. In the past it was PGAdmin, but now it’s not in our repo so it’s
not a problem: their upstream is building their own RPMs, which is a good
thing for us. We are building extra packages mostly for Patroni.</p>
 
 
<p>However, this is a potential problem for some enterprise users because
large companies don’t even want to use the EPEL repo because they feel
like it’s like it’s not a community repo, but a community repo controlled
by Fedora and RedHat. That’s why from time to time I
try to add some of the packages to our repo.</p>
 
 
<p>If it’s a problem for enterprise users, does it mean we should we maintain
tons of extra packages in the EPEL repo for the GIS stack? The answer is
“no, definitely no”. Not just because of the human power that we need to
maintain those those packages —  I mean rebuilding them is easy: I just
get the source RPM, commit the spec files into our repo, and rebuild them.
But maintaining them is something else.</p>
 
 
<p>We will have a similar problem when we release our own ICU package in the
next few years. Because, now that we have the in core collation — but
just for C Locale  —-  and people are trying to get rid of glibc, maybe
we should have an ICU package. But maintaining an ICU Library across a
single Postgres major version is a real big challenge that I don’t know
how to solve for now, at least.</p>
 
 
<p>And then SLES — my pain in the neck — the GIS stack requires lots of
repos on SLES 15. They are they are well documented on on our website.</p>
 
 
<p>Fedora is safe because Fedora is Fedora, everything is there, it’s easy to
get a package there.</p>
 
 Jeremy S in chat: “Building them is easy. Maintaining them is
something else.” 
 
 
 
<p>Yeah that’s that’s the problem, Jeremy.</p>
 
 
<p>So how do you RPMify an extension?</p>
 
 
<p>The first thing is to know that the extension exists. This is one of the
big problems between developers and users. The developer creates a useful
extension and then they don’t create a tarball, they don’t release
anything. They expect people to install Git on their production databases
and <code>git pull</code>, install <code>make</code>, <code>gcc</code>, all the development
libraries and build a binary, blah, blah blah.</p>
 
 
<p>I’m sorry that’ss not going to work. It also doesn’t work for pip — pip
is not a package manager, it just destroys your server. It downloads
things to random places and then everything’s gone. That’s why I added
lots of Python packages to support Patroni, because most of the users use
the packaging package manager to install Postgres and other packages to
their servers. It’s the same for Debian, Ubuntu, for RPMs, for Windows,
for macOS.</p>
 
 
<p>So first of all we know have to know that the extension exists and we have
to have a tallbal. If I see an extension that seems good enough I’ll get
there. PGXN is a good place, because when I go to pgxn.org a few times per
day and see if there is a new version of an extension or if there’s new
extension, it’s a good piece. But there’s a problem: we have hundreds of
extensions — maybe thousands — but not all of them are on PGXN. They
should be!</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him) in chat: You should follow
<a href="https://botsin.space/@pgxn">@pgxn@botsin.space</a> for new releases :-)</p>
 
 
<p>nils in chat: pg_xz incoming</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>I don’t know how to solve this problem, but we should expect every
extension to announce their extensions on PGXN. I’m not just talking about
installing everything through PGXN, but at least have an entry that
there’s a new extension, this is repo, the website, the readme and the is
a tarball. It doesn’t have to be on PGXN, as long as we have something.</p>
 
 
<p>And then I check the version. If there is an extension that will kill your
database and the version is 0.001, that’s not going to be added to the
repo, because we don’t want to distribute an experimental feature.</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him) in chat: LOL, all my extensions start at
0.0.1</p>
 
 
<p>David G. Johnston in chat: If it isn’t on PGXN it doesn’t exist.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Another problem is that  lots of people write extensions but some of them
are just garbage. I’m sorry but that’s the truth. I mean they just release
a version and then do nothing.</p>
 
 David Wheeler (he/him) in chat: LOLOLOL 
 
 
 
<p>From the chat, “pgxn_xz is coming”: that’s right! We have <a href="https://bitbucket.org/adunstan/blackhole_fdw/src">blackhole_fdw</a>,
which was written by Andrew Dunstan. When you create blackhole_fdw, it throws all
of your data into black hole, so everything is gone.</p>
 
 
<p>Yeah, “if it’s not on PGXN it doesn’t exist,” that’s what I hope we
achieve achieve in the next year or so.</p>
 
 Jimmy Angelakos in chat, replying to “If it isn’t on PGXN …”: I
would correct that to “If it isn’t on PGXN it isn’t maintained.”
Sometimes even ON PGXN… 
 
 
 
<p>Yeah Jimmy, that’s one of the big problems that we have: maintenance.</p>
 
 
<p>We create the spec file, just copy one of the existing ones and start
editing. It’s easy but sometimes we have to add patches. We used to carry
patches for each Postgres major version to change the <code>Makefile</code>s for the
specific Postgres major version. But I realized that it was [not a great
pattern]. Now we just export the path, which fixes the problem.</p>
 
 David G. Johnston in chat: As a policy though, someone who cares and
wants responsibility needs to apply to be part of the RPM community. 
 
 
 
<p>Then I initiate a scratch build for any missing requirements. If there are
any missing build requirements it fails to build. I only do it on Fedora
latest, not for every package because it doesn’t always help because some
distros may not have the missing dependency</p>
 
 
<p>Alvaro Hernandez in chat: Hi everybody!</p>
 
 
<p>David G. Johnston in chat: Delegated to PGXN for that directory.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Let’s say we rely on some really good feature that comes with a latest
version of something, but that latest version may not appear in RedHat 7
or 8. So some dist dros may have it, but the version may be lower than
required. Or some distros may have the dependency under different name.
Now in the spec file we have “if SUSE then this” and “if RedHat then this”
“if Fedora then”, “if RedHat nine then this”, etc. That’s okay, it’s
expected. As long as we have the package, I don’t care.</p>
 
 
<p>Then I push it to the Git repo, which I use not just for the spec files
and patches, but also for carrying the spec files and pitches to the build
instances.</p>
 
 
<p>Jorge in chat: How to handle extension versioning properly? I mean,
in the control file the version could be anything, like for ex. citus
default_version = ‘12.2-1’ where the “published version” is v12.1.2,
then the “default version” could remain there forever.</p>
<p>Also have seen in the wild extensions that the control file have a
version 0.1 (forever) and the “released” version is 1.5</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>If something fails I go back to the drawing board. GCC may fail (gcc 14
has been released on Fedora 40 and is causing lots of issues for for
packaging nowadays), it could be <code>cmake</code> — too recent or too old. It
could be LLVM — LLVM18 is a problem for Postgres nowadays. I either try
to fix it ping upstream. I often ping upstream because the issue must be
fixed anyway</p>
 
 
<p>If everything is okay, just push the packages to the repo.</p>
 
 Ruohang Feng (Vonng) in chat: question: how about adding some good
extensions written in Rust/pgrx to the repo? like pgml,  pg_bm25,
pg_analytics, pg_graphql…. 
 
 
 
<p>One issues is that there is no proper announcement. Maybe I have an
awesome extension available in the Postgres repo that people crave and, we
build the extensions, it took a lot of time (thank you Jimmy, he helped me
a lot) and then I didn’t actually announce it that much. On the other
hand, people just can use PG stat base [?] to install and start using it
in a few seconds. This is something that we should improve.</p>
 
 
<p>Steven Miller in chat: How to handle system dependencies like libc
versions being updated on the target system? Do extensions need to be
complied against exactly a specific libc version?</p>
 
 
<p>From Nevzat in chat: how can we make sure bugfix or extension is
safe before installing it</p>
 
 
<p>vrmiguel in chat: Interesting approach to identify build/runtime
requirements</p>
<p>Over at Tembo we have a project called trunk-packager which attempts
to automatically create .deb packages given the extension’s shared
object.</p>
<p>We try to identify the dynamic libs the extension requires by parsing
its ELF and then trying to map the required .so to the Debian package
that provides it, saving this info in the .deb’s control file</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>From the chat: How to handle extension versions properly? That’s a good
thing but, extension version and the release version don’t have to match.
Thr extension version isn’t the same thing as the release version. It’s
the version of the SQL file or the functions or the tables, the views,
sort procedures, or whatever. If it’s 0.1 it means it’s 0.1 it means
nothing nothing has changed in this specific regarding the control file.
They they may bump up the package version because they may add new
features, but if they don’t add new features to the SQL file, then they
don’t update the extensions. I hope that answers your question George</p>
 
 
<p>I have another question from Ruohang. Yaaaaay! I was afraid that someone
would ask that one. We have no extensions written in Rust in repo so far.
It’s not like Go; there is a ban against Go because we don’t want to
download the world, all the internet just to build an extension. If I
recall correctly they’re rewriting pg_anonymizer in Rust. They will let me
know when they release it or they’re ready to release it, and then I’ll
build it. It’s not something I don’t like, it just hasn’t happened.</p>
 
 
<p>Keith Fiske in chat: I still update the control file with my
extensions even if it’s only a library change. Makes it easier to know
what version is installed from within the database, not just looking
at the package version (which may not be accessible)</p>
 
 
<p>Ruohang Feng (Vonng) inchat: question: How to handle RPM and
extension name conflicts, e.g., Hydra’s <code>columnar</code> and Citus’s
<code>columnar</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>*David Wheeler (he/him) in chat, replying to “I still update the c…”
Yeah I’ve been shifting to this pattern, it’s too confusing otherwise</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>If you think there are good extensions like these, just create a ticket on
<a href="https://redmine.postgresql.org">redmine.postgresql.org</a>. I’m happy to take a look as long as I know them.
That’s one of the problems: I have never heard about pg_analytics or pgml,
because they’re not on PGXN. Or maybe they are. This is something that we
should improve in the next few months.</p>
 
 
<p>Jimmy Angelakos in chat: Go is a pretty terrible ecosystem. It has
its own package manager in the language, so it’s kinda incompatible
with distro packages</p>
 
 
<p>Jason Petersen in chat: (but that means a build is safe within a
single release, it doesn’t mean you can move a built extension from
one Fedora version to another, right?)</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him) in chat, replying to “How to handle
system…”: Libc is stable in each major version of the OS, and there
are separate RPMs for each.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Another question from Steven: how to handle system dependencies like libc
version updates. The answer is no. It’s mostly because they don’t update
the libc major version  across the across across the lifetime of the of
the release. So we don’t need to rebuild the extension against libc.</p>
 
 
<p>Steven Miller in chat, replying to “How to handle system…”: Ok I
see, TY</p>
 
 
<p>Jason Petersen in chat, replying to “How to handle system…”: Is
that how we deploy in trunk, though?</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him) in chat, replying to “Go is a pretty
terri…”: Huh? You can build binaries in a sandbox and then you just
need the binary in your package.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>[Addressing Nevzat’s question]: That’s a great question. It’s up to you!
It’s no different than installing Postges or any other thing. I just build
RPMs. If you’re reading the hackers mailing list nowadays, people rely on
me an Christoph and others, so that we don’t inject any code into the RPMs
or Debian packages. You just need to trust us not to add extra code to the
packages. But if there’s a feature problem or any bug then you should
complain upstream, not to us. so you should just test.</p>
 
 
<p>Jimmy Angelakos in chat, replying to “Go is a pretty terri…”: Find
me one person that does this.</p>
 
 
<p>Steven Miller in chat, replying to “How to handle system…”: We
don’t have OS version as one of the dimensions of version packaging
but should</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>[Addressing vrmiguel’s comment]: Yeah, that could be done but like I don’t
like complex things, that’s why I’m an RPM packager.</p>
 
 
<p>Jason Petersen in chat, replying to “Go is a pretty terri…”:
(doesn’t go statically link binaries, or did they drop that
philosophy?)</p>
 
 
<p>vrmiguel in chat: I think citus has changed it to citus_columnar</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him) in chat, replying to “Go is a pretty
terri…”: Hugo:
<a href="https://github.com/hugomods/docker/tree/main/docker/hugo">https://github.com/hugomods/docker/tree/main/docker/hugo</a></p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him) in chat, replying to “Go is a pretty
terri…”: Jason: Static except for libc, yes</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Another question from Ruohang: uh how to handle RPM and extension name
conflicts. I think Citus came first, so you should complain to Hydra and
ask them to change the name. They shouldn’t be identical. We have
something similar with Pgpool: they they are conflicting with the PCP
Library ,which has been in the Linux for the last 25 years. I think Pgpool
has to change their name.</p>
 
 Jeremy S in chat, replying to “I still update the c…”: So you
think people will run the “alter extension upgrade” eh? 
 
 
 
<p>[Addressing Keith Fiske’s comment]: I’m not saying I don’t agree with you,
but it means every time I have to update my extension version in my
running database — it’s some extra work but that’s okay. It’s the user
problem, not my problem.</p>
 
 
<p>Question from Jason [on moving an extension from one Fedora to another]:
Right, it may not be safe because the GCC version may be different and
other stuff may be different. One distro to another is not safe, Jason;
sorry about that.</p>
 
 
<p>[Back to Steven’s question]: Yes, David’s answer is right.</p>
 
 
<p>[Addressing vrmiguel’s comment about citus_columnar]: You are right.</p>
 
 
<p>Jimmy I’m not going to read your comment about go because I
don’t think think you can swear enough here.</p>
 
 
<p>vrmiguel in chat, replying to “Go is a pretty terri…”: Are there
known Postgres extensions written in Go? Not sure how Go is relevant
here</p>
 
 
<p>Jason Petersen in chat: you said “gcc” and not “libc” there, are you
implying that things like compiler versions and flags need to be
identical between postgres and extensions</p>
 
 
<p>Keith Fiske in chat, replying to “I still update the c…”: I think
they should …</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him) in chat, replying to “Go is a pretty
terri…”: Were some experiments a few years ago.
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/microo8/plgo">https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/microo8/plgo</a></p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Let me continue now. First you have to know the extension exists, and then
the you also need to know that the extension has an update. Unfortunately
the same problem: the extension exists or has an update and they just
don’t let us know.</p>
 
 Jimmy Angelakos in chat, replying to “Go is a pretty terri…”:
@vrmiguel&nbsp;now you know why :D 
 
 
 
<p>This is a big challenge Fedora has in house solution.When you add a new
package to Fedora, I think they crawl their repo once a day and if there’s
new release they create a ticket in their bug tracker automatically, so
that the maintainer knows there’s a new version. This can be done, but
would need a volunteer to do it. Orr maybe the easiest thing is just add
everything to the to PGXN,</p>
 
 
<p>When we update an extension we, have to make sure it doesn’t break
anything. It requires some testing. As I said earlier, building is one
thing, maintaining the extension is a bigger thing. If you want to raise a
baby, you are responsible until until the end of your life. Consider this
like your baby: either just let us know if you can’t maintain an extension
anymore or please respond to the tickets that I open.</p>
 
 
<p>Steven Miller in chat: One other detail about compatibility
dimensions. We have noticed some extensions can be complied with
chip-specific instructions like AVX512, for example vector does this
which optimizes performance in some cases</p>
 
 
<p>Alvaro Hernandez in chat, replying to “you said “gcc” and n…”: I’d
reverse the question: do we have strong guarantees that there are no
risks if versions and/or flags may differ?</p>
<p>I believe extensions are already risky in several ways, and we should
diminish any other risks, like packaging ones.</p>
<p>So I’d say absolutely yes, compile extensions and Postgres in exactly
the same way, versions and environments.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Sometimes a new minor version of an extension breaks a previous Postgres
release. For example, an extension drops support for Postgres 12 even
though Postgres 12 is still supported. Or they didn’t do the upgrade path
work. I have to make sure everything is safe.</p>
 
 
<p>nils in chat, rReplying to “I think citus has ch…”: It was never
changed, the extension has always either been embedded in Citus or
later moved to a separate extension called citus_columner.</p>
<p>I think the name conflict comes from the access method being called
<code>columnar</code>, which Citus claimed first. (Hydra’s started actually as a
fork from Citus’ codebase).</p>
<p>(disclaimer; I work on Citus and its ecosystem)</p>
 
 
<p>Jason Petersen in chat, replying to “I think citus has ch…”: hi
nils</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Next month a new beta comes out. Everyone is happy, let’s start testing
new features. For the packagers that means it’s time to start building
extensions against beta-1. So a build might fail, we fix it, and then it
may fail against beta-2. I understand if extension authors may want to
wait until rc-1. That’s acceptable as long as they let us know. Many of
them fail, and then Christoph and I create tickets against them and
display them <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PostgreSQL_16_Extension_Bugs">on wiki.postgresql.org</a>. It’s a Hall of Shame!</p>
 
 
<p>Eric in chat: When you decide to package a new extension do you
coordinate with upstream to make that decision?</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him) in chat, replying to “When you decide to
p…”: I learned I had extensions in the yum repo only after the fact</p>
 
 
<p>Eric in chat, replying to “When you decide to p…”: I see</p>
 
 
<p>vrmiguel in chat: @Devrim Gündüz&nbsp;I’m curious about how RPM deals with
extensions that depend on other Pg extensions</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him) in chat: You can test Postgres 17 in the
pgxn-tools docker image today. Example:
<a href="https://github.com/theory/pgtap/actions/runs/8502825052">https://github.com/theory/pgtap/actions/runs/8502825052</a></p>
 
 
 
 
<p>This list pisses off the extension authors because they don’t respond to
ticket. So what do we do next? It happens again and again and again,
because they just don’t respond to us. On Monday uh I got a response from
an extension maintainer. He said “you are talking like you are my boss!” I
said, “I’m talking like I’m your user, I’m sorry. I just asked for a very
specific thing.”</p>
 
 
<p>nils in chat: I love Devrim’s issues against our repo’s! They are
like clockwork, every year 😄</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him) in chat, replying to “You can test
Postgre…”: It relies on the community apt repo</p>
 
 
<p>Eric in chat, replying to “When you decide to p…”: Related: ever had
upstream request you stop packaging an extension?</p>
 
 
<p>Steven Miller* in chat, replying to “One other detail abo…”: Even if
compiled inside a container, on a specific chip it can get
chip-specific instructions inside the binary. For example building
vector on linux/amd64 inside docker on a chip with AVX512, the
container image will not work on another linux/amd64 system that does
not have AVX512</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him) in chat: :boss:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Unresponsive maintainers are a challenge: they don’t respond to tickets,
or emails, or they don’t update the extensions for recent Postgres
versions.</p>
 
 
<p>Don’t get me wrong even the big companies also do this, or they don’t
update the extensions for the new GCC versions. I don’t expect them to
test everything against all all the GCC versions; that’s that’s my
problem. But just respond please.</p>
 
 
<p>What’s the responsibility of the packager in this case? Should we fork if
they don’t respond at all? No we are not forking it! VBut going to
conferences helps, because  if the extension author is there I can talk to
them in person in a quiet place, in a good way, just “please update the
package tomorrow or you’re going to die”. Of course not this but you see
what I mean.</p>
 
 
<p>[Looking at chat]: I’m going to skip any word about containers; sorry
about that.</p>
 
 
<p>[Addressing Eric’s question]: That’s a good so so the question! No,
actually they support us a lot, because that’s the way that people use
their extensions. And do we coordinate with upstream? No, I coordinate
with myself and try to build it. Of course upstream just can just create a
ticket, send me email, or find me at a conference. They can say, “hey, we
have an extension, could you package an RPM?” Sure, why not." I don’t
coordinate with Upstream as long as uh there is no problem with the builds.</p>
 
 Eric in chat, replying to “When you decide to p…”: So you haven’t
run into a situation where upstream did not want/appreciate you
packaging for them? 
 
 
 
<p>[Respondinding to nils’s comment]: Thank you, thanks for responding!</p>
 
 
<p>[Responding to vrmiguel’s question about depending on other extensions]:
We actually add dependency to that one. That’s bit of uh work, like PG
rotting depends on PostGIS. In order to provide a seamless installation
the PostGIS package, in the PostGIS spec file, I add an extra line that
says it provides PostGiS without the version as part of the name. Then
when we install pg rotting, it looks for any PostGIS package — which is
fine because it can run against any PostGIS version. So I add the
dependency to other extensions if we need them.</p>
 
 David G. Johnston in chat: The tooling ideally would report, say to
PGXN or whatever the directory location for the initial application
is, the issues and remind them that if the build system cannot build
their extension it will not be included in the final RPM. You are an
unpaid service provider for them and if they don’t meet their
obligations their don’t get the benefit of the service. 
 
 
 
<p>[Responding to Eric’s upstream follow-up question]: I haven’t seen
anything in any upstream  where a person didn’t want me to package. But I
haven’t seen many appreciations, either; I mean they don’t appreciate you.
I’m being appreciated by EDB — money, money, money, must be funny —
thanks EDB! But I haven’t had any rejections so far. Good question!</p>
 
 Eric in chat, replying to “When you decide to p…”: Fair. Cool.
Thanks 
 
 
 
<p>Relying on external repos is a big problem for SUSE. Some of the
maintainers just discontinue their repo. One problem with SUSE is they
don’t have an EPEL-like repo. EPEL is a great thing. The barrier to add a
package to EPEL is not low but not high, either. If you if you’re an
advanced packager you can add a package quick enough. Of course it
requires review from others. But this a big problem for SUSE.</p>
 
 
<p>Lack of maintenance is a problem. We have a repo but they don’t update it;
so I have to go find another repo from build.opensuse.org, change it,
update the website, change our build instance, etc. That’s a big problem.</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him) in chat, replying to “The tooling ideally
…”: I want to add build and test success/fail matrices to extension
pages on PGXN</p>
 
 
<p>Florents Tselai in chat: How do you handle Pl/Python-based
extensions + pip dependencies? Especially with virtualenv-based
installations. i.e. Pl/Python usually relies on a /usr/bin/python3,
but people shouldn’t install dependencies there.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>And then there’s costs! What’s the cost of RPMifying an extension? Hosting
a build server?  We have a very beefy bare metal build server hosted by
Enterprise DB, just because I’m working for them and they have a spare
machine. Hosting a build server is a cost.</p>
 
 
<p>I have to use some external resources for architecture reasons, like some
of our build instances, like PPC 64 ,is hosted somewhere else. There are
some admin tasks to keep everything and running, like EDB’s IT team
actually helped me to fix an issue today in both of our PPC instances.</p>
 
 
<p>Jason Petersen in chat, replying to “How do you handle Pl…”:  I
think early on he said he makes the extensions rely on RPMs that
provide those Python dependencies</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him) in chat, replying to “How do you handle
Pl…”: I have used this pattern for RPMifying Perl tools</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Then, maintaining build instances requires keeping them up-to-date, and
also that each update doesn’t break anything. It’s not like “dnf update
and build a package”. No. It may be a problem with Fedora because Fedora
may can update anything any time they want. But it’s a less problem for
SUSE and RedHat, but we have to take care that the updates don’t break
anything.</p>
 
 
<p>Redhat, the company, actually follows our release schedule. We release
every three months. Unless something bad happens, we know the next release
is in May, on a Thursday. So every Wednesday, one day before our minor release,
RedHat releases their new maintenance releases. RedHat is going
to release 9.4 on Wednesday before our minor release. What does that mean
for us as an RPM packager for RedHat?</p>
 
 
<p>*RedHat releases a new version with a new LLVM, for example, and then it
means we have to rebuild the packages against the new LLVM so that people
can use it. That means I have to work until Thursday morning to build the
packages. That’s fine but another problem is for Rocky and Alma Linux
users, because they’re are not going to have the updated LLVM package, or
any any updated package, like GCC. It’s not like the old RedHat days; they
change everything uh in minor versions.</p>
 
 
<p>So I have to rebuild GCC and LLVM on our instances, add them to our
special repo “sysupdates”, which is in the config file, and this takes
many hours because building GCC and LLVM is a big thing.</p>
 
 
<p>In the last two years I have not been able to build the from GCC Source
RPM. I had to edit everything and not edit the spec files blah blah to be
able to build it. I have no idea how how they can break in Source RPM.</p>
 
 
<p>So that’s another cost: in May I’m going to spend lots of cycles to  keep
up with the latest RedHat release, and also make the make the Rocky Linux
and Alma Linux users happier. Maintaining build systems is not as easy as
running Yup or Zypper update. It requires employing the packager —
because I have the bills pay I have the beers to drink.</p>
 
 
<p>[Addressing Florents’s PL/Python question]: I don’t know what the
PL/Python based extensions are, but I tried to get rid of everything
related to pip. I’m not a developer, a DBA isn’t a developer, a Sysadmin
isn’t a developer. They’re not suposed to use pip; they are supposed to
use the package manager to keep up with everything. My point is if someone
needs pip then I should fix it. That’s what I did for Patroni. I added
lots of packages to our Git repo just to be able to support Patroni.</p>
 
 
<p>Ian Stanton in chat: Need to drop, thank you Devrim!</p>
 
 
<p>Jeremy S in chat, replying to “How do you handle Pl…”: A lot of
larger companies have inventory management and risk control processes
that heavily leverage package management</p>
 
 
<p>Alvaro Hernandez in chat: Need to go, ttyl!</p>
 
 
<p>vrmiguel in chat, replying to “you said “gcc” and n…”: Do you
think there are no guarantees at all? For instance, Postgres loads up
the extension with <code>dlopen</code>, which could fail with <code>version mismatch</code>.
If that doesn’t occur and the extension loads ‘fine’, how likely do
you think an issue could be?</p>
<p>Also I’m curious how often you’ve seen problems arise from libc itself
(rather than any of the many things that could cause UB in a C
program) and how these problems have manifested</p>
 
 
<p>Ahmet Melih Başbuğ in chat: Thank you</p>
 
 
 
 
 Conclusion 
<p>I thanked Devrim and all the discussion, and pitched the next <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/851125899477/" title="Postgres Extension Ecosystem Mini-Summit">mini-summit</a>,
where I think Jonathan Katz will talk about the TLE vision and specifics.</p>
<p>Thank you all for coming!</p>

<p>‘The Mythical Man-Month’ by Frederick P. Brooks, Jr. is a classic in the software industry. First published in 1975, it’s almost 50 years old. Brooks was the project manager of one of the most complex software projects in the world at the time: the IBM System/360 operating system. He published this book based on his personal experience of spending several years building it, and leading several hundred programmers.</p><p>I’ve been making my way through this book from the dawn of software, to see which predictions the book gets right or wrong, and what’s different about engineering today - and which things just never change. In <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/what-changed-in-50-years-of-computing">Part 1 of this series</a>, we covered chapters 1-3. In this article, we cover chapters 4-7:</p>  <p>Evolution of architecture approaches: The outdated separation of “architect” and implementer, the dated “technical manual” concept, software design and the “second-system effect,” &amp; telephone logs.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Architecture approaches: what’s the same. A well-architected system balances simplicity and functionality, and it’s still hard to do. Processes are still needed for proposing and discussing architecture changes for mature products and larger teams.</p>  <p>Communication challenges on large projects: then and now. Surprisingly, communication best practices have changed little in 50 years; mixing informal, formal, and written forms for efficient projects.</p>  <p>Ideal structure of tech orgs. The tree structure was the most favored for tech organizations in the 1970s, and it still is the most popular choice today. Are simplicity and straightforwardness the reason why?</p>   1. Evolution of architecture approaches <p>When it comes to how we design software, a lot has changed in 50 years:</p>

<p>This article shows how to implement a web application using backend for frontend security architecture for authentication and consumes data from a downstream API protected using a JWT access token which can only be accessed using an app-to-app access token. The access token is acquired using the OAuth2 client credentials flow and the API does not accept user access tokens from the UI application. OpenIddict is used as the OpenID Connect server. The STS provides both the OAuth2 client and the OpenID Connect client as well as the scope definitions.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/bff-aspnetcore-angular-downstream-api">https://github.com/damienbod/bff-aspnetcore-angular-downstream-api</a></p>



<p></p>



<p>The BFF web application is implemented using ASP.NET Core and Angular as the UI tech stack. The Angular part of the web application can only use the ASP.NET Core APIs and secure same site cookies are used to protect the access. The whole application is authenticated using an OpenID Connect confidential code flow client (PKCE). If the web application requires data from the downstream API, a second OAuth client credentials flow is used to acquire the access token. The downstream API does not accept the user delegated access tokens from the UI application.</p>







<p></p>



 BFF OIDC code flow client 



<p>Implementing the OpenID Connect confidential client is really simple in ASP.NET Core. The AddAuthentication method is used with cookies and OpenID Connect. The cookies are used to store the session and the OpenID Connect is used for the challenge. All server rendered applications are setup like this with small changes required for the OIDC challenge. Due to these small differences, the different OIDC implementations provide specific implementations of the client. These are normally focused and optimized for the specific OIDC servers and do not work good with other OIDC servers. Once you use more than one OIDC server or require multiple clients from the same OIDC server, the client wrappers cause problems and you should revert back to the standards.</p>


  var stsServer = configuration["OpenIDConnectSettings:Authority"];

services.AddAuthentication(options =&gt;
{
    options.DefaultScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    options.DefaultChallengeScheme = OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
})
.AddCookie()
.AddOpenIdConnect(options =&gt;
{
    configuration.GetSection("OpenIDConnectSettings").Bind(options);

    options.SignInScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    options.ResponseType = OpenIdConnectResponseType.Code;

    options.SaveTokens = true;
    options.GetClaimsFromUserInfoEndpoint = true;
    options.TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
    {
        NameClaimType = "name"
    };
});
  


<p></p>



 Yarp Proxy 



<p>The Angular UI can only request data from the ASP.NET Core backend using secure http only cookies. The Angular UI is deployed as part of the ASP.NET Core application in production builds. When creating applications, software developers need to use their preferred tools and YARP is used to support this in the development setup. As a further downstream API is used, YARP can also be used to support this. The proxy takes the API request, validates the cookie, uses another access token and forwards the request to the downstream API. YARP has an ITransformProvider interface which is used to implement this. This also means we have two different YARP configuration setups for development and deployments. (test, integration, production).</p>


  using System.Net.Http.Headers;
using Yarp.ReverseProxy.Transforms;
using Yarp.ReverseProxy.Transforms.Builder;

namespace BffOpenIddict.Server.ApiClient;

public class JwtTransformProvider : ITransformProvider
{
    private readonly ApiTokenCacheClient _apiTokenClient;

    public JwtTransformProvider(ApiTokenCacheClient apiTokenClient)
    {
        _apiTokenClient = apiTokenClient;
    }

    public void Apply(TransformBuilderContext context)
    {
        if (context.Route.RouteId == "downstreamapiroute")
        {
            context.AddRequestTransform(async transformContext =&gt;
            {
                var access_token = await _apiTokenClient.GetApiToken(
                    "CC",
                    "dataEventRecords",
                    "cc_secret");

                transformContext.ProxyRequest.Headers.Authorization
                    = new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", access_token);
            });
        }
    }

    public void ValidateCluster(TransformClusterValidationContext context)
    {
    }

    public void ValidateRoute(TransformRouteValidationContext context)
    {
    }
}
  


<p></p>



<p>The AddReverseProxy is used to add the YARP services.</p>


  builder.Services.AddReverseProxy()
   .LoadFromConfig(builder.Configuration.GetSection("ReverseProxy"))
   .AddTransforms&lt;JwtTransformProvider&gt;();
  


<p>And the middleware:</p>


  app.MapReverseProxy();
  


 API client credentials client 



<p>The YARP proxy uses the OAuth client credentials client to get an access token to access the downstream API. The token is stored in a cache and only rotated when it expires or is missing. The app-to-app security has nothing to do with the delegated client from the web application.</p>

 Downstream API 



<p>The downstream API is protected using JWT access tokens. This is setup using the AddJwtBearer method. The scope and other claims should also be validated.</p>


   services.AddAuthentication()
           .AddJwtBearer("Bearer", options =&gt;
           {
               options.Audience = "rs_dataEventRecordsApi";
               options.Authority = "https://localhost:44318/";
               options.TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
               {
                   ValidateIssuer = true,
                   ValidateAudience = true,
                   ValidateIssuerSigningKey = true,
                   ValidAudiences = ["rs_dataEventRecordsApi"],
                   ValidIssuers = ["https://localhost:44318/"],
               };
           });
  


 Notes 



<p>This setup can be used for all server rendered applications. You should always use an external identity provider in enterprise setups and never roll out your own identity system as this is expensive to maintain and many enterprise environments no longer accept this due to the extra operation costs.  Replacing Angular with react, Vue.js, Svelte or Blazor WASM does not require changes to the authentication. The different UI have differences on how the scripts are loaded or used and some require weaker session security setups. </p>



<p>You should also avoid downstream APIs if not required. Modular monoliths have performance advantages.</p>

There are several signs pointing that we have hit the peak of the AI hype – and perhaps already passed it by a little. Companies spending 10x on GPUs than revenue generated, AI startups unable to raise the next round of funding, and irrationally high valuations for AI startups whose technology is about to be commoditized.</p>  <p>Commercial open source companies in trouble? Redis Labs changed the formerly permissive open source Redis license to a restrictive one, with the goal to have cloud providers pay when they host Redis. As a response, cloud providers started the Valkey project, which could become the “new and still permissive Redis.” HashiCorp is facing similar challenges with Terraform / OpenTofu. We could be seeing the end of billion-dollar companies built on permissive open source licenses.</p>  <p>Section 174: still hurting US software companies. The US remains the most hostile country in the world to start a software business: because developer salaries cannot be deducted as an expense. The US Senate has a bill that would fix this: but this bill shows no signs of being passed.

<p>👋 Hi, this is Gergely with a subscriber-only issue of the Pragmatic Engineer Newsletter. In every issue, I cover challenges at Big Tech and startups through the lens of engineering managers and senior engineers. To get articles like this in your inbox, every week, subscribe:</p><p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/subscribe?">Subscribe now</a></p><p>Before we start: I’ve published details on <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/pragmatic-engineer-guest-article/">how indicate interest in writing a guest article The Pragmatic Engineer</a>. My goal is to work with hands-on engineering professionals to occasionally bring details, learnings and approaches from "working in the weeds.” A good example was last week’s article on <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/thriving-as-a-founding-engineer">Thriving as a founding engineer</a>. If you’re interested in potentially writing a guest post, <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/pragmatic-engineer-guest-article/">see the details</a>.</p><p>A few months ago, I met up with my former engineering manager colleagues for dinner. As we caught up on each other’s news, one topic of chat was the new generation of tech workers. A common thing mentioned was that GenZ feels notably different to work with. Positive in many ways – and a bit confusing in others!</p><p>So, what is the new generation like at work, according to their colleagues? In a survey, we asked this of readers who identify as Millennial, GenX, or Boomer, and have dug into the replies.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, we cover:</p>  <p>Who are GenZ? A recap.</p>  <p>Survey respondents. Mostly managers and seniors who are Millennial or GenX, based in the US and Europe.</p>  <p>Values. Higher salary and benefits expectations, challenging to retain, more distrustful of senior leadership.</p>  <p>Knowledge. GenZ are on the “bleeding edge” of frameworks, higher up on the tech stack, and use different learning resources.</p>  <p>Mentoring GenZ: what works? Display purpose, focus on the individual, and connect!</p>  <p>Working with GenZ: successful approaches. Give feedback, consider extra onboarding and training, and accept they’ll probably leave.</p>  <p>Pandemic impact? Enforced remote work began just as many people started their first jobs. It was a hard time for graduates and young professionals, for whom staying indoors – and on endless Zoom calls – was likely the last thing they wanted to do.</p>  <p>More observations and advice for GenZ. A generation of “mages,” and a possible bimodal distribution for ambition. Also, sharing the unfiltered <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/40654455/reports">survey responses</a>.</p>  <p>This is part 1 of a two-part high-level overview on the new generation of talent in tech workplaces. This article is based on a small survey of people’s personal opinions, beginning with the views of more “seasoned” folks. But it won’t be a one-sided series! In part 2 to come soon, we hand the mic to tech professionals from GenZ, to learn what it’s like being young and in tech today – and what older colleagues are like to work with.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd628304c-a6de-4678-9c89-9dcdbe63108a_1654x1172.png">    </a>Some of the findings we’ll explore in this article  1. Who are GenZ? A recap. <p>Generation Z (GenZ) is the group name for people born between 1997 and 2012, and it’s commonly used in media and popular culture. In workplaces, the most senior members of this new generation have joined colleagues from the cohorts “Millennial,” “GenX,” and “Baby Boomer.” Each of these names refers to a span of time, and birth date determines which one you fit into:&nbsp;</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb720c42f-8d37-421f-8ebc-43a70037c5e7_1600x971.png">    </a>An overview of demographic cohorts. Image source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials">Wikipedia</a> <p>The oldest members of GenZ are 27 years old, and the youngest are 12, meaning that graduate developers hired over the past few years are almost all GenZ’ers.</p><p>They’re the first generation to grow up “mobile native,” with consumer tech like smartphones, often from a very young age. The oldest members of this generation were aged 10 when the Apple iPhone launched in 2007 and kicked off the smartphone revolution.</p><p>There are <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/search?q=genz">countless studies</a> claiming GenZ is different from earlier ones. A summary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Z">from Wikipedia</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“Compared to previous generations, members of Generation Z tend to live more slowly than their predecessors when they were their age; have lower rates of teenage pregnancies; and consume alcohol (but not necessarily other psychoactive drugs) less often. Generation Z teenagers are more concerned than older generations with academic performance and job prospects, and are better at delaying gratification than their counterparts from the 1960s, despite concerns to the contrary. (...) Nostalgia is a major theme of youth culture in the 2010s and 2020s.”</p></blockquote><p>For reference, here is how Millennials are described, also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials">by Wikipedia</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“As the first generation to grow up with the Internet, Millennials have also been described as the first global generation. The generation is generally marked by elevated usage of and familiarity with the Internet, mobile devices, and social media. The term "digital natives", which is now also applied to successive generations, was originally coined to describe this generation.</p><p>Millennials have also been called the ‘Unluckiest Generation’ because the average Millennial has experienced slower economic growth since entering the workforce than any other generation in U.S. history. The generation has also been weighed down by student debt and child-care costs.</p><p>Millennials across the world have suffered significant economic disruption since starting their working lives; many faced high levels of youth unemployment during their early years in the job market in the wake of the Great Recession, and suffered another recession in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.”</p></blockquote><p>And let’s not forget GenX:</p><blockquote><p>“As adolescents and young adults in the 1980s and 1990s, Xers were dubbed the ‘MTV Generation’ (a reference to the music video channel), sometimes being characterized as slackers, cynical, and disaffected. Some of the many cultural influences on Gen X youth included a proliferation of musical genres with strong social-tribal identity such as alternative rock, hip hop, punk, post-punk, rave, and heavy metal. (...) Video games, both in amusement parlors and in devices in Western homes, were also a major part of juvenile entertainment for the first time. Politically, in many Eastern Bloc countries, Generation X experienced the last days of communism and the transition to capitalism as part of its youth. In much of the Western world, a similar time period was defined by a dominance of conservatism and free market economics.<br><br>In their midlife during the early 21st century, research describes Gen Xers as active, happy, and achieving a work–life balance. The cohort has also been more broadly credited as entrepreneurial, and productive in the workplace.”</p></blockquote> 2. Survey Respondents <p>Sixty three readers took part in the survey. Here’s a breakdown of their current job titles:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F214b453a-b350-4d12-b5f2-dc992d08096d_1172x1068.png">    </a>Most are in management roles (manager, director-level, VP or C-level) or software engineers (senior-and-above.) “Other” covers product and data roles <p>Most respondents are based in the US and Europe:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F93fda12c-1bbe-431f-82bd-a5447a35a039_1148x1068.png">    </a>Respondents by location <p>Most respondents belong to the Millennial or GenX generations.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F457f3a15-d659-490b-93f8-dd17fd35434c_1230x1122.png">    </a>Respondents, by generation. The lack of Boomers is unsurprising, since most are near retirement <p>What I don’t know is the extent to which participants in the survey reflect the newsletter’s readership. But there’s a way to find out. My newsletter platform (Substack) launched surveys that let you vote with a click. So, I have a request; would you please tap below on the generation you belong to, based on your birth date? Voting is anonymous, and your vote isn’t linked to your email.</p> <p>Many thanks to all who share this detail! With that, let’s dive into the survey’s findings.</p> 3. Values <p>A note of caution: of course, it’s impossible to sum up a whole generation based on a mix of opinions from a few workplaces! The details in this article are anecdotal, based on individuals’ experiences.&nbsp;</p><p>We know labels like “GenZ” are loose and fail to account for the inherent diversity of millions of people, which simply cannot be summed up in a collection of observations, no matter how detailed. There are GenZ folks to whom none of the respondents’ views apply, as well as people with traits which no respondent captured.&nbsp;</p><p>Our goal with this survey is just to try and identify any distinctive characteristics which could be worth paying attention to. How can we work together with this younger generation and build great products and a thriving business? It’s undeniable that differences exist between successive generations, and it’s worth attempting to verbalize these. The new generation of software engineers is no different!</p> Higher expectations for salary, promotions and benefits <p>Common themes from the responses:</p>  <p>GenZ expects bigger raises and faster promotions</p>  <p>Benefits like flexible or remote working are expected</p>  <p>Some respondents say younger colleagues don’t appear to offer as much in return, such as shouldering higher expectations, or taking on extra responsibilities. To be fair, this sounds like fairly typical “early-stage career” behavior; I remember Millennials being described like this 10-15 years ago!</p> Hard to retain, high expectations, &amp; little “loyalty” <p>It’s clear that survey respondents think GenZ expects promotions faster, and aren’t shy to jump ship for better pay. Respondents say there is little to no “corporate loyalty” either. This is understandable; can we entirely blame people for putting their own career first, especially after waves of ruthless job cuts in software engineering by companies following their own interests? Also, switching jobs for better pay occurs across the generations.</p><p>A lack of corporate “loyalty” among young colleagues is noted positively by some respondents:</p><blockquote><p>“Retaining them is hard, there is no loyalty to the company. But this is a good thing, as we have seen that companies, even great ones like Google, aren't loyal to their people! So, you need to be creative, move GenZ colleagues around a lot within the team (keep the work fresh), use retention strategies (options, bonuses, etc.,) and find empathetic managers.” <br><br>– Director of Engineering at a startup acquired by Big Tech (GenX, US)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“From my old-school perspective, they are somewhat entitled, expecting flexibility, yearly raises and promotions – even when the company has no need for more managers, for example. They also expect significant benefits on top of our higher-than-market pay.&nbsp;</p><p>As many before me have said, they have cast off outdated expectations of ‘loyalty’ to jobs that aren't loyal to them, in return. It's admirable for the most part, though I do not think everyone should get raises/promotions every year in a small company.”</p><p>– Head of Product at a startup (Millennial, US)</p></blockquote><p>Retaining GenZ workers is harder, according to some responses:</p><blockquote><p>“Motivating and retaining seems to be increasingly difficult, as they have all been advised to job hop around the two-year mark in order to have a chance at earning more. Which I don’t blame them for – it’s just that it is tough for managers who have little say/influence on their reports’ pay packages.”<br><br>– Senior Software Engineer at a Fintech (GenX, US)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“I see a challenge around motivation and retention. There is somehow a baked-in assumption that just turning up to work means you should get a pay rise. Until very recently (due to the downturn in tech jobs,) it was extremely difficult to retain without using a lever, such as compensation.”&nbsp;</p><p>– VP of SRE at startup (GenX, US)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“I find retaining them hard when it comes to money: sometimes they get crazy offers for positions! They will apply to positions that they are only starting to be ready for. Older peers tend to take a different approach: they sometimes need to feel more confident about their capabilities in the target role before changing jobs.”</p><p>– Platform Director at a Fintech (Millennial, France)</p></blockquote><p>Could social media influencers be fuelling career impatience among young professionals? One respondent reckons so:</p><blockquote><p>“Almost impossible to retain; expected salaries and titles more often than not surpass their actual ability about 6-12 months into tenure. From conversations with fellow managers and university lecturers, it seems YouTube and LinkedIn influencers are fuelling unrealistic expectations.&nbsp;</p><p>Specifically: over-stating market-rate salaries; while understating levels of responsibility that accompany a given salary range”</p><p>– Head of Engineering at a Series A startup (Millennial, UK)</p></blockquote><p>It’s tempting to blame social media, but I reckon what we’re seeing is that GenZ have far more (good and bad) career advice from peers than previous generations did. Sure, this advice isn’t always perfect, even when it’s well-meant.</p> Senior leadership distrusted, demand for transparency <p>Survey respondents think GenZ colleagues have less trust in management, and are skeptical of business decisions:</p><blockquote><p>“I find GenZ to be strong believers in radical transparency. They want to know the ‘why’ behind many decisions. The speed with which they want to consume this information is also much higher than other generations.&nbsp;</p><p>I have observed that GenZ have a stronger distrust of senior leadership than other generations. My hypothesis is that with the tech retraction in 2022-2023, this generation was going through its first downturn and thus questioned why there were no visible consequences for company leadership.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking back to the sub-prime crisis of 2008 – my first downturn after graduating college – I was also concerned. However, I saw that this was more than just a specific company issue, and was a much larger economic problem. One could correctly say that the tech retraction of 2022 and the sub-prime crisis of 2008 are not apples-to-apples, but I think there are some similarities.”</p><p>– Engineering Manager at a startup (Millennial, Boston, US)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“They are very aware and cynical of the impact of capitalism on business decisions.” <br><br>– Frontend Engineer at Amazon (GenX, Canada)</p></blockquote><p>Workplaces with low transparency may have a hard time retaining GenZ workers, some respondents believe:</p><blockquote><p>“My hunch would be that GenZ won’t stay long in cultures where transparency is not the norm, and where it’s not okay to question upwards, and in a direct way.”<br><br>– Senior DevOps Engineer in the public sector (Millennial, Singapore)</p></blockquote><p>A fitting summary comes from an engineering manager:</p><blockquote><p>“The don’t take management bullsh*t.”<br><br>– Group Engineering Manager at a scaleup (GenX, Australia)</p></blockquote> Outspoken, open communication style <p>Blunt communication is something older colleagues notice:</p><blockquote><p>“They have no trouble interacting with their peers, older folks. There weren’t any occasions where communication was a problem, I’ve not received or heard of any negative feedback.&nbsp;</p><p>This being said, they were more likely to speak out against and voice their concerns directly. Whether it was work related (disagreeing with an analysis, decision, etc,) or non-work related (good movies and tv shows.) This happens at varying levels<br> between individuals, but it is common among the GenZ’ers I’ve interacted with.<br><br>Some of my colleagues were disarmed by their frankness. Some found that the GenZ were too open, insensitive, and should be more sensitive of their environment, and of people hearing what they said. Others embraced the directness and it built strong relationships that lasted beyond the internship. “<br><br>– Senior DevOps Engineer in the public sector (Millennial, Singapore)</p></blockquote><p>A few other respondents mention that the communication style ruffles the feathers of some senior colleagues:</p><blockquote><p>“It can be hard for older peers, as younger new joiners often feel free to share strong opinions about how things are done, that could be harmful for others.”<br><br>– Platform Director at a scaleup (Millennial, Spain)</p></blockquote><p>The reasons for such directness and bluntness are well-intended, says one respondent:</p><blockquote><p>“They are clearly intent on improving the status quo.” <br><br>– VP of SRE at a scaleup (GenX, UK)</p></blockquote><p>An important trait pointed out by a VP:</p><blockquote><p>“They are usually willing to speak truth to power.”<br><br>– VP of Engineering (Boomer, US)</p></blockquote><p>Does the age-old age gap explain older professionals’ reactions to young colleagues, or is there more to it? Certainly, many survey responses mention GenZ’s “in your face” communication style. Cultural factors may be at play, and perhaps GenZ is a generation that speaks its mind, regardless of whether to a peer, or the business’s Boomer CEO!</p><p>Personally, I think this fits into existing workplace trends; better teams already spend time ensuring graduate colleagues feel unafraid to speak up when senior peers are in the room. Indeed, companies like Meta <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/54316453/standout-differences-between-facebook-and-other-big-tech-companies">got rid of titles of seniority</a> in order to encourage precisely this behavior. But it’s always good to bear in mind the thin line between directness and rudeness.&nbsp;</p> Modern values? <p>Survey respondents say GenZ colleagues are more vocal about work-life balance, flexibility of work, mental health, and diversity. They are more protective of free time, but friendlier and more personal in the office than older colleagues. Survey responses from GenZ tech workers confirm these observations.</p><p>Protecting free time:</p><blockquote><p>“They are much less willing to do the work to grow on their own time. They are also much more willing to take a break and protect their own time.”<br><br>– Head of Design at a scaleup (GenX, US)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“They have a dim view of working outside the 9-5.“<br><br>– Staff Engineer at a startup (Boomer, US)</p></blockquote><p>Informality and openness:</p><blockquote><p>“GenZ is much more open about sharing personal situations: mental health, life events, etc. As a manager, I like this as it lets me know what is going on and how to help them.<br><br>– Director of Software development, large tech company (GenX, US)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“Much more informal in the workplace; they tend to have friendlier, closer relationships with colleagues. They also excel at workplace culture and work-life balance.”<br><br>– Frontend engineer at Amazon (Millennial, US)</p></blockquote><p>Diversity and inclusivity:</p><blockquote><p>“They are very much pushing for a great, healthy culture and a lot of diversity – this is good! Mental health is something front and center for them, which is great to see in the workplace.”<br><br>– Staff Software Engineer at a scaleup (GenX, New York, US)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“I’ve found that GenZ engineers are more inclusive of different backgrounds and people at the company/on teams.”<br><br>– Senior Software Engineer, scaleup (Millennial, US)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“They are more aware of diversity issues.”<br><br>– CTO at a mid-sized company (Boomer, Europe)</p></blockquote><p>The importance of flexibility:</p><blockquote><p>“Flexible hours are very important for them, as is independence, and working in a ‘flat’ hierarchy.”</p><p>– CTO at a mid-sized company (Boomer, Europe)</p></blockquote><p>Workplace politics:</p><blockquote><p>“The mere existence of people who don't agree with them politically seems deeply upsetting oftentimes, but maybe that's a symptom of a larger issue of polarization in the U.S. When I entered the workforce, I thought it was understood that religion and politics were completely off the table AT WORK because it should go without saying that not everybody is in complete lockstep with the same ideology, and yet we must still work together and see one another every day.“<br><br>– Senior Software Engineer at a startup (Millennial, US)</p></blockquote><p>Caring about things earlier generations do not:</p><blockquote><p>“From my point of view as a member of GenX, GenZ can be critical of things that I don't even notice. For example, they might use Firefox over Chrome because Firefox is part of the truly open internet.”<br><br>– Head of Design at a dev tools company (GenX, US)</p></blockquote> Purpose and meaning <p>GenZ seems more inspired by a strong sense of purpose and meaning, according to their older colleagues. Maybe this is why they’re seen as questioning everything: they want to know the why of tasks and decisions, and to do things for the right reasons!</p><blockquote><p>“I see the GenZ people need a strong purpose. When the company can provide it to them, it's easier to keep them motivated.”<br><br>– Team Lead at a startup (Millennial, Brazil)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“GenZ engineers can be extremely motivated to do right by the user, particularly if the problem they are solving has a deep impact on something meaningful.“<br><br>– Head of Design at a dev tools company (GenX, US)</p></blockquote> 4.

<p>This article shows some of the base conditional access policies which can be implemented for all Microsoft Entra ID tenants. Phishing resistant authentication should be required for all administration flows and some other user policies like sign-in risk MFA or terms of conditions. I recommend these base policies when implementing an Microsoft Entra ID tenant using a P2 license.</p>



 Disable security defaults 



<p>The security defaults are a good basic setup, but when a P2 license is used, conditional access policies can be applied and the tenant can be setup to force things like phishing resistant authentication.</p>



<p>Disable on the tenant in the “your-tenant” | Overview | Properties</p>







<p></p>



<p>All the security defaults are disabled and good conditional access policies are now required.</p>



 Activate conditional access policies 



<p>There are many conditional access policies. These are applied and different depending on the tenant requirements. The following base policies make sense in all tenants:</p>



 
 Force MFA conditional access policy (All users) 



 Require Terms of Use policy 



 Block legacy authentication  (All users) 



 Enable Sign-in risk policy  (All users) 



 Require phishing resistant authentication for admins 



 Enable User risk policy (All users) 
 



<p>A single break glass account is excluded from these policies and this account should never be used except in an emergency. Alerts are required on this account. </p>



 1. Force MFA  conditional access policy 



<p>Multi-factor authentication can be forced for all users except the break glass account. This uses the “Require authentication strength” policy and the tenant can set the default strength as required.</p>



<p>Add the following policy ( Force MFA All users except break glass account )</p>







<p></p>



 2. Require Terms of Use policy 



<p>Add a Require Terms of Use for app ( App Require Terms of Use ) policy. You can use Microsoft Entra ID to force the users of the tenant and all the client apps to except the terms of conditions required by the tenant and the hosted applications.</p>



<p>The terms of use needs to be added to the Azure tenant:</p>



<p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/terms-of-use">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/terms-of-use</a></p>



<p>The policy can be created for the terms of use. See the Microsoft docs for details.</p>



<p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/require-tou">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/require-tou</a></p>



<p></p>



 3. Block legacy authentication 



<p>Block the legacy authentication in the tenant. The Client apps should select only the Exchange ActiveSync clients and Other clients and the access must be blocked.</p>



<p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-block-legacy">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-block-legacy</a></p>







<p></p>



 4. Enable Sign-in risk policy 



<p>You can activate the sign-in risk and choose how strict. If a risky sign-in is detected, the user is required to do a multi-factor authentication. This requires a P2 license for user accounts. See the Microsoft docs for details:</p>



<p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/howto-identity-protection-configure-risk-policies">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/howto-identity-protection-configure-risk-policies</a></p>







<p></p>



 5. Require phishing resistant authentication for admins 



<p>Phishing resistant MFA should be applied to app administrator workloads. This can be created from the Azure provided template.</p>



<p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/how-to-policy-phish-resistant-admin-mfa">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/how-to-policy-phish-resistant-admin-mfa</a></p>



<p>The policy is applied to the Azure roles:</p>



 
 Global Administrator 



 Application Administrator 



 Authentication Administrator 



 Billing Administrator 



 Cloud Application Administrator 



 Conditional&nbsp;Access Administrator 



 Exchange Administrator 



 Helpdesk Administrator 



 Password Administrator 



 Privileged Authentication Administrator 



 Privileged&nbsp;Role&nbsp;Administrator 



 Security Administrator 



 SharePoint Administrator 



 User Administrator 
 



<p>When a user account has one of the Azure admin roles, phishing resistant authentication is required for access to the tenant.</p>







<p></p>



 6. Enable User risk policy (All users) 



<p>If a user account has a high or medium level possibility that it has been compromised, the user is required to do a multi-factor authentication. Why not Self-service password reset (SSPR)? I don’t really see the point of this if you are using passwordless sign-ins. Without a SSPR for a user with a password, the user-risk is not reset and the user will be forced to MFA again. I am not sure how this policy works with passwordless or phishing resistant authentication flows. This policy only makes sense with the high threat category and the block user. This requires a P2 license for users accounts.</p>







<p></p>



 Summary 



<p>These are the base policies and further policies can be added depending on the tenant requirements. Some session based controls would normally make sense as well.</p>







<p></p>



 Notes 



<p>The examples of the continuous access policies are shown and set up using the Azure portal. This would be way better as a terraform script and a fully automated set up using something like Azure DevOps or Github actions.</p>

There are several <a href="https://www.tradefinanceglobal.com/posts/12-companies-using-blockchain-to-rewire-trade-and-trade-finance/">other blockchains</a> dedicated to trade, but these five are the big&nbsp;ones.</p> Why Business Blockchains Fail <p>So why all the embarrassing failures? Ledger Insights <a href="https://www.ledgerinsights.com/marco-polo-blockchain-trade-finance-insolvency/">explains</a> the troubling trend this&nbsp;way:</p><blockquote>“In most cases, the issue was a failure to achieve market fit and scale before the money ran out rather than any particular blockchain technology.”</blockquote><p>I agree, blockchain’s technology didn’t cause these failures. Blockchains fail because they are platforms — an assertion I defend in detail below — and as we’ve seen in industry after industry, it’s nearly impossible to get entire industries to join the same platform. Blockchains succeed when they out-compete other blockchains for adoption, no different than centralized platforms.</p><p>What’s needed to enable secure global digital interoperability for trade are <a href="https://knightcolumbia.org/content/protocols-not-platforms-a-technological-approach-to-free-speech">protocols, not platforms</a>, specifically protocols for the secure peer-to-peer exchange of verifiable trade instruments. (&lt;&lt; Read the linked essay, it’s important.) While such protocols aren’t the only thing needed to achieve this elusive objective —standard schema also comes to mind , and is discussed below— protocols are necessary to escape the fatal limitations inherent to blockchains and other platforms.</p> How Blockchains Are Platforms <p>Blockchains inherently follow the same “EUM” pattern of the centralized, proprietary platforms they claim to replace, screaming “Everybody Use Me”, or more accurately, “Everybody use my service”. And though permissionless blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum may have decentralized governance — which is more than cool — business blockchains have their governance centralized around a single decision-making body, typically a consortium, that makes all the&nbsp;rules.</p><p>But regardless of whether a blockchain has decentralized or centralized governance, one common, inescapable fatal flaw remains: a blockchain is a single logical database that all counterparties must agree to use; a singular, rent-seeking source of truth that sits in the middle of all interactions just like proprietary platforms do.</p><p>Blockchains are not truly peer-to-peer, despite their claims. The fact that all participants depend upon the same master set of data — along with its bespoke technology, economics, security, and governance — is why there are so many blockchains competing for adoption, and with near-zero interoperability between&nbsp;them.</p><p>The problem isn’t with blockchain technology, it’s the blockchain model&nbsp;itself.</p> Platforms vs. Protocols <p>All blockchains are platforms, and are not protocols. This is not a subjective distinction. There is a simple way to determine whether something is a platform or a protocol: all platforms have one telltale sign in common: a rent-seeking entity or network that sits in the middle of all interactions. A protocol, such as TCP/IP, HTML, SMTP, 802.11, etc., is a language used entirely peer-to-peer, with no rent-seeking entity or network between peers and no master dataset generated or depended&nbsp;upon.</p><p>Being a platform doesn’t guarantee failure, however, as we see with Komgo. The world is full of successful platforms and Komgo is still around because it out-competed other trade blockchains for adoption, but then ditched their blockchain when they realized that blockchain was slowing them down and a traditional centralized database was better. The fact that they could make such a smooth transition away from blockchain illustrates my point: whether using a blockchain or a database under the hood, the platform-style relationship between Komgo and its users was identical, with Komgo sitting in the middle of every interaction and all participating counterparties paying rent. That’s a fine way to make money but an impossible way to make global trade digitally interoperable, because for twenty years we’ve learned and re-learned the same lesson, in industry after industry: it’s nearly impossible to get all necessary counterparties to use the same platform, no matter how powerful its partners are and no matter how much money it&nbsp;has.</p><p>Like all industries that struggle with digital interoperability, trade needs protocols, not platforms. For two decades now the trade industry has endeavored to create an electronic bill of lading to replace the paper one, without success. In my view this lack of success has been because competitive platforms lack the incentive to directly interoperate, seeing it as a competitive sacrifice, and they have no protocol available as an indirect alternative. Traditional proprietary platforms started this EUM, winner-takes-all pattern, then the blockchain consortia came along and promised something different: an exciting new way to break through the paper-to-digital logjam. But these trade blockchains acted no differently and did no better than the traditional platforms, ultimately leaving the industry still dependent on paper and paper facsimiles (PDFs).</p><p>In contrast, an open, non-proprietary protocol designed for trade could bring a new alternative: a common language that even competitive trade counterparties can speak to each other that brings interoperability without sacrificing competitive standing.</p> A “Universal Translator” For&nbsp;Trade <p>This brings us to the image and its caption at the beginning of this article: The trade industry needs a “universal translator”.</p><p>In Star Trek, when wearing a universal translator you can speak to any creature in the galaxy using your preferred language and they’ll hear you in theirs, and when they speak their preferred language you hear it in yours. Now imagine if all creatures in the universe were required to use a single, proprietary rent-seeking platform, network, or dataset in the middle to accomplish this, instead of adopting a common protocol/language… it would never work. The only way to solve such a galactic problem: a common, open protocol that’s adopted everywhere that enables devices to use a common, agreed-upon language with each other while speaking bespoke languages to each&nbsp;wearer.</p><p>That’s what protocols are: languages. In the case of Star Trek’s universal translator, the protocol is the language spoken between the devices; it must be free, open, and separate from the language spoken between the device and its wearer. Protocols don’t generate shared datasets like blockchains do and they don’t have rent-seeking actors in the middle. Protocols are like SMTP that enabled email senders and recipients to each build or buy their own favored email clients, rather than having to use a common platform like AOL, Prodigy, or CompuServe to exchange messages. Languages can be spoken peer-to-peer between any two parties without a third-party between them, so they are inherently decentralized.</p> Digital Containers &amp;&nbsp;Payloads <p>It’s tempting to think of a data schema as a protocol, and in a sense it can be: for two parties to have semantic interoperability — to understand each other and be able to ingest and utilize received data from each other — there must be some degree of agreement about data schema. But the same is true with paper, which depends on common data elements if not exact schema. For digital environments, standardized schema for trade is being worked out by the <a href="https://www.dsi.iccwbo.org/">ICC DSI</a> and others, but… even ubiquitously agreed-up on data schema does not address the need for securely exchanging the schematized data; that part is still missing, it’s like agreeing on the format of physical mail without considering the need for a mail carrier. In the digital realm that ‘carrier’ must have verifiable security from origination to delivery. Without security, common schema is pointless; without common schema, security is&nbsp;useless.</p><p>To be crystal clear on this critical point: even when a data schema has been widely agreed to, without a protocol — a common language — for exchanging data securely, there’s no way to verify the source of the data and that it hasn’t been tampered with, revoked, or expired. This security element was supposed to be supplied by blockchains — which are quite secure, though they don’t address critical identity or key management issues — but their platform-like attributes prevented broad adoption for the reasons listed above, leaving trade back where it started: paper and paper-like facsimiles (PDFs).</p><p>What’s needed are protocols for secure data exchange that act like digital ships and containers, with schematized data as the payload. Imagine a trading world where all data is received in the form of a standardized schema that arrived in a secure data container that is instantly verifiable in three critical&nbsp;ways:</p>  The identity of the originators of the data, and of all who contributed to or endorsed&nbsp;it;  It hasn’t been tampered with, revoked, or expired since origination;  It doesn’t require subscribing to any particular blockchain, network, or proprietary platform.  <p>Having secure, globally verifiable data containers with schematized data as the payload is when the global trading game really changes. And it requires protocols, not platforms, to eliminate competitive sacrifices, maximize adoption, and have limitless scale.</p> In Conclusion <p>This is something we are working on at Digital Trust Ventures: free, open protocols for trade that work like digital ships and containers and result in a “universal translator”-like effect for counterparties, enabling each to speak and hear their chosen “language”. And like physical containers, these digital containers will have no opinion about the payload inside; the job of these protocols is to ensure that exchanged data is verifiably not tampered with, revoked, or expired, without need of platforms, networks, other entities in the&nbsp;middle.</p><p>More to come, later this year. Stay&nbsp;tuned.</p>

Is it called an OAuth "grant" or a "flow"? What about "grant type"?
<p>These are common questions when writing documentation for OAuth-related things. While these terms are all used in <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749">RFC 6749</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://oauth.net/2/">many extensions</a>, the differences between the terminology is never actually explained.</p>
<p>I wanted to finally write down a definition of the terms, along with examples of when each is appropriate.</p>
 
   
    flow - use "flow" when referring to the end-to-end process, for example:
     
       "the client initiates the flow by..." 
       "the flow ends with the successful issuance of an access token" 
       This can also be combined with the type of flow, for example: 
       "The Authorization Code flow starts by..." 
     
   
   
    grant - use "grant" when referring to the specific POST request to the token endpoint, for example:
     
       "The authorization code grant includes the PKCE code verifier..." 
       "The refresh token grant can be used with or without client authentication..." 
       "Grant" also refers to the abstract concept of the user having granted authorization, which is expressed as the authorization code, or implicitly with the client credentials grant. This is a bit of an academic definition of the term, and is used much less frequently in normal conversation around OAuth. 
     
   
   
    grant type - use "grant type" when referring to the definition of the flow in the spec itself, for example:
     
       "there are several drawbacks to the Implicit grant type" 
       "the Authorization Code grant type enables the use of..." 
     
   
 
<p>Let me know if you have any suggestions for clarifying any of this, or any other helpful examples to add! I'm planning on adding this summary to OAuth 2.1 so that we have a formal reference for it in the future!</p>

<p>TL;DR: I’d like Postgres community input on a decision: Should we build PGXN
v2 services and tools in Go or Rust? Context for the question and some
weighing of options constitutes the rest of this post, but to skip to the end,
<a href="https://dev.star.vote/Election/tqkv3v" title="Poll: What language should PGXN v2 tools and services be written in?">🗳️ Vote</a> your choice! Poll closes April 12 at the end of the day (midnight)
New York time.</p>
 
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/orgs/pgxn/projects/1/views/1">PGXN v2 project</a> now under way requires developing or updating several
services and tools, including:</p>
 
 A <a href="https://github.com/pgxn/planning/issues/8" title="PGXN v2 Planning: #8: Implement Root Registry">root registry</a> for source distribution 
 A <a href="https://github.com/pgxn/planning/issues/11" title="PGXN v2 Planning: #11: Implement Packaging Registry">package registry</a> for binary distribution 
 A <a href="https://github.com/pgxn/planning/labels/client" title="PGXN v2 Planning: #cli">command line client</a> for developing, building, and distributing
extension packages 
 An <a href="https://github.com/pgxn/planning/issues/20" title="PGXN v2 Planning: #20: Implement Interactions Service">interactions service</a> for notifications and stats aggregation 
 
<p>And more. Historically, the PGXN tools were written in <a href="https://www.perl.org" title="The Perl Programming Language">Perl</a>, which was an
ideal choice for me back in 2011, and quite familiar to many members of the
core team, but also deeply foreign to most everyone else. Furthermore, its
dynamic nature and need for dozens of dependencies in most apps makes
installation and packaging a challenge, to say the least.<a>1</a></p>
<p>In the last ten years I’ve become quite proficient in <a href="https://go.dev" title="The Go Programming Language">Go</a>. I appreciate its
near system-level performance, memory safety, robust standard library,
concurrency design, and short learning curve — especially for web services.
But perhaps most eye-opening to me, as a long-time user of dynamic languages,
is that, like C, Go compiles an application into a single static binary. Not
only that, but Go provides <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_compiler" title="Wikipedia: “Cross compiler”">cross compilation</a> natively. This makes
distribution incredibly simple.</p>
 Distribution Digression 
<p>Compare, for example, <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/docker-sqitch/blob/main/Dockerfile">the <code>Dockerfile</code></a> for <a href="https://sqitch.org" title="Sqitch: the sensible database change management system">Sqitch</a>, the database change
management system I wrote and maintain in Perl. It’s…a lot. Sure there are
a ton of system dependencies, but what’s invisible in this file is the weeks
of work that went into <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/sqitch/blob/develop/inc/Module/Build/Sqitch.pm">Module::Build::Sqitch</a>, which performs a bunch of
tricks to build the Sqitch “app” as a single directory with all of its Perl
dependencies. Don’t get me wrong, the work was worth it for Sqitch, and powers
the <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/homebrew-sqitch/blob/main/Formula/sqitch.rb">Homebrew formula</a>, as well. But even there, I’ve not been able to get
Sqitch into the <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/129128" title="homebrew-core#129128 sqitch 1.3.1 (new formula)">Homebrew core</a> because every single dependency requires a
checksum, and I’ve not had the time (or energy) to figure out how to generate
them.</p>
<p>Contrast with this <code>Dockerfile</code> for a Go service compiled into a binary named
<code>thinko</code>:</p>
  <code>FROM gcr.io/distroless/base-debian12:latest

# TARGETOS and TARGETARCH: https://docs.docker.com/build/guide/multi-platform/
ARG TARGETOS
ARG TARGETARCH

COPY "_build/${TARGETOS}-${TARGETARCH}/thinko" /thinko/bin/
USER nonroot:nonroot
ENTRYPOINT [ "/thinko/bin/thinko" ]
</code>  <p>That’s the whole thing. There are no dependencies at all, aside from
a few included in <a href="https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless" title="distroless: 🥑 Language focused docker images, minus the operating system">distroless</a> image. And where does that image come from?
This is the relevant from the project <code>Makefile</code>:</p>
  <code>.PHONY: all # Build all binaries
all: local linux darwin windows freebsd

linux: thinko-linux
darwin: thinko-darwin
windows: thinko-windows
freebsd: thinko-freebsd

thinko-linux: _build/linux-amd64/thinko _build/linux-arm64/thinko
thinko-darwin: _build/darwin-amd64/thinko _build/darwin-arm64/thinko
thinko-windows: _build/windows-amd64/thinko _build/windows-arm64/thinko
thinko-freebsd: _build/freebsd-amd64/thinko _build/freebsd-arm64/thinko

# Build Thinko for specific platform
_build/%/thinko: cmd/thinko
	GOOS=$(word 1,$(subst -, ,$*)) GOARCH=$(word 2,$(subst -, ,$*)) $(GO) build -o $@ ./$&lt;
</code>  <p>This configuration allows me to build <code>thinko</code> for every OS and architecture
at once:</p>
  <code>$ make thinko
go build -o _build/local/thinko ./cmd/thinko
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o _build/linux-amd64/thinko ./cmd/thinko
GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm64 go build -o _build/linux-arm64/thinko ./cmd/thinko
GOOS=darwin GOARCH=amd64 go build -o _build/darwin-amd64/thinko ./cmd/thinko
GOOS=darwin GOARCH=arm64 go build -o _build/darwin-arm64/thinko ./cmd/thinko
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o _build/windows-amd64/thinko ./cmd/thinko
GOOS=windows GOARCH=arm64 go build -o _build/windows-arm64/thinko ./cmd/thinko
GOOS=freebsd GOARCH=amd64 go build -o _build/freebsd-amd64/thinko ./cmd/thinko
GOOS=freebsd GOARCH=arm64 go build -o _build/freebsd-arm64/thinko ./cmd/thinko
</code>  <p>Those first two commands build <code>thinko</code> for Linux on amd64 and arm64, right
where the <code>Dockerfile</code> expects them. Building then is easy; a separate <code>make</code>
target runs the equivalent of:</p>
  <code>$ docker buildx build --platform linux/arm64 -f dist/Dockerfile .
$ docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -f dist/Dockerfile .
</code>  <p>The <code>--platform</code> flag sets the <code>TARGETOS</code> and <code>TARGETARCH</code> arguments in the
<code>Dockerfile</code>, and because the directories into which each binary were compiled
have these same terms, the binary compiled for the right OS and architecture
can be copied right in.</p>
<p>And that’s it, it’s ready to ship! No mucking with dependencies, tweaking
system issues, removing unneeded stuff from the image. It’s just the bare
minimum.</p>
<p>This pattern works not just for Docker images, of course. See, for example,
how [Hugo], the Go blog generator, <a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases" title="Hugo Releases">releases</a> tarballs for a bunch of OSes and
architectures, each containing nothing more than a <code>README.md</code>, <code>LICENSE.md</code>,
and the <code>hugo</code> binary itself. This pattern allows both the <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/8fb177a/Formula/h/hugo.rb">Hugo Homebrew
formula</a> and its <a href="https://github.com/hugomods/docker/blob/main/docker/hugo/snippets/common" title="Hugo base Dockerfile"><code>Dockerfile</code></a> to be incredibly simple.</p>
 Back to PGXN 
<p>I very much want these advantages for the next generation of PGXN tools. Not
only the services, but also the command-line client, which would become very
easy to distribute to a wide variety of platforms with minimal effort.</p>
<p>But there are other variables to weigh in the choice of language for the PGXN
servers and tools, including:</p>
 
 
<p>Familiarity to other developers: Ideally someone can quickly
contribute to a project because they’re familiar with the language, or
there’s a short learning curve.</p>
 
 
<p>Safety from common issues and vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows,
and dangling pointers.</p>
 
 
<p>Tooling for robust and integrated development, including dependency
management, testing, distribution, and of course cross-compilation.</p>
 
 
 Decisions, Decisions 
<p>In my experience, there are two language that fulfill these requirements
very well:</p>
 
 🐿️ <a href="https://go.dev" title="The Go Programming Language">Go</a><a>2</a> 
 🦀 <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org" title="Rust Programming Language">Rust</a> 
 
<p>Which should we use? Some relevant notes:</p>
 
 
<p>I expect to do the bulk of the initial development on PGXN v2, as the only
person currently dedicated full time to the project, and I’m most familiar
with Go — indeed I enjoy writing web services and CLIs in Go!. I’d
therefore be able go ship Go tools more quickly.</p>
 
 
<p>But I’ve played around with Rust a number of times over the years, and
very much would like to learn more. Its syntax and long feature list
steepen the learning curve, but given my background in Perl — another
language with unique syntax and context-sensitive features — I’m certain
I could become incredibly proficient in Rust after a few months.</p>
 
 
<p>My employer, <a href="https://tembo.io/" title="Tembo: Goodbye Database Sprawl, Hello Postgres">Tembo</a>, is a Rust shop, and we’ll likely borrow heavily from
the <a href="https://github.com/tembo-io/trunk" title="trunk: Package manager and registry for Postgres extensions">trunk</a> project, especially for the CLI and binary registry. It would
also be easier for my coworkers to contribute.</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://github.com/pgcentralfoundation/pgrx" title="pgrx: Build Postgres Extensions with Rust!">pgrx</a>, the tooling to build Postgres extensions in Rust, has taken the
community by storm, rapidly building familiarity with the language among
extensions developers. Perhaps some of those developers would also be
willing to turn their expertise to PGXN Rust contributions, as well.
It’s likely some features could be borrowed, as well.</p>
 
 
<p>Sadly, the <a href="https://gitlab.com/microo8/plgo" title="plgo: easily create postgresql extensions in golang">plgo</a> project appears to have stalled, so has not built
up the same community momentum.</p>
 
 
<p>This leaves me torn! But it’s time to start coding, so it’s also time to
make some decisions. Should PGXN v2 services and tool be:</p>
 
 🐿️ Written in Go 
 🦀 Written in Rust 
 🐿️ + 🦀 Some of each (e.g., Go for web services and Rust for CLIs) 
 
<p>What do you think? If you were to contribute to PGXN, what language would
you like to work in? Do you think one language or the other would be more
compatible with community direction or core development?<a>3</a></p>
<p>Got an opinion? <a href="https://dev.star.vote/Election/tqkv3v" title="Poll: What language should PGXN v2 tools and services be written in?">🗳️ Vote</a>! Poll closes April 12 at the end of the day (midnight)
New York time.</p>
<p>And if those choices aren’t enough for you, please come yell at me <a href="https://xoxo.zone/@theory" title="@theory@xoxo.zone">on
Mastodon</a>, or via the <a href="https://postgresteam.slack.com/archives/C056ZA93H1A" title="Postgres Slack/#extensions: Extensions and extension-related accessories">#extensions</a> channel on the <a href="https://pgtreats.info/slack-invite" title="Join the Postgres Slack">Postgres Slack</a>. Thanks!</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Ever wonder why PGXN isn’t hosted by community servers? It’s
because I screwed up the installation trying to balance all the
dependencies without wiping out Perl modules the systems depend on. 🤦🏻‍♂️&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a></p>
 
 
<p>Pity there’s no gopher emoji yet.&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a></p>
 
 
<p>I can imagine a future where an extension CLI was included in core.&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a></p>

<p>The overhead of performing even simple tasks online is getting larger and larger. I question the security of almost all these supposedly "secure" messaging systems. And I'm tired of the 'Utopia of Rules' mindset pervasive in every organization. It's exhausting how they expect customers to constantly adapt to their needs.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ef02110-581b-4474-a3d8-cb9dc177d43b.heic">    </a> <p>I don't know if you recall the game Kerplunk. It's a classic children's game that has been around for decades. I remember playing it with my sister. The basic setup involves a transparent plastic tube, a number of sticks, and marbles. The sticks are threaded through the tube to form a web or nest at the bottom on which the marbles rest. We'd take turns removing a stick at a time, trying not to let any marbles fall through the web and out of the tube. At some point, the remaining sticks can't hold the marbles and everything falls down.</p><p><a href="https://www.technometria.com/p/web-20-is-collapsing-under-its-own?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share">Share</a></p><p>The modern web reminds me more and more of a big Kerplunk game and I think the marbles are about to fall. What started out as an easier way to do things like shop, bank, and get health care information has become increasingly complex over time. More and more of the email I receive seems to be simply directing me to log into some bespoke system to retrieve a message or engage in some workflow. And even with a password manager, the act of logging in is often a chore with different user interfaces, custom MFA requirements, and weird rules for passwords. Once you're on the system, session time-outs induce their own form of anxiety since stepping away for a few minutes to attend to something else might require going through the whole Kafkaesque process all over again. The modern web has turned into a dystopian theater of the absurd where even reading a simple appointment reminder from your doctor requires several minutes of stress-inducing interaction with baroque systems and processes.</p><p>And it's not just doctors, of course, banks, government agencies, hospitals, ecommerce sites, and customer service systems all adopt these special purpose messaging systems. If you ask these organizations why they use bespoke messaging systems, they'll list things like "timely and improved communication," "convenience," and "privacy and security." But the real reason is that it's more convenient for them because these systems are integrated with their backends and make their processes more manageable. There's certainly nothing about them that's more convenient, timely, or better than email for their customers1.</p><p>I also question the privacy and security premise. Email can be insecure. And your email provider can see the contents of your emails. But the messaging system run by your doctor or bank is likely less secure than the email systems run by Apple, Google, and the others. And achieving privacy by making everything incompatible so that you have to use a different system for each correspondent is like chopping off your finger to prevent hangnails.</p><p>How did we get here? Bureaucracy. Not just government bureaucracy, but bureaucracy of all kinds. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00MKZ0QZ2/technometria-20">Utopia of Rules</a>2, David Graeber talks about how power imbalances force the less powerful group to perform what he calls interpretive labor, the work of understanding and implementing what's better or more convenient for the more powerful partner. People are not equal participants in online interactions. We don't have the tools to be fully embodied online3. Because of this we are forced to play by the rules organizations online who are digitally embodied with servers, identity systems, customer management systems, and so on. And part of that is being forced to use their inconvenient and anemic messaging systems.</p><p>What's the answer? People need tools. I think digital wallets (a bad name for an important tool), <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml">autonomic (peer) identifiers</a> with strong cryptography, and verifiable credentials are a huge step forward. These tools provide the means for people to be peers online rather that mere ghosts in someone else's machine. That's why I insist on using the term self-sovereign rather than decentralized to describe these systems. <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/cogito_ergo_sum.shtml">Cogito Ergo Sum</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.technometria.com/subscribe?">Subscribe now</a></p> Notes   <p>For a deeper dive into why one-off messaging systems are never as good as email, see <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2012/05/rich_sharing_and_personal_channels.shtml">Rich Sharing and Personal Channels</a>. Email and other useful messaging systems exhibit a property called rich sharing that makes them much more robust that the simple idea of "sharing a message" would bring to mind.</p>  <p>If you're interested in power imbalances and how they come about, I can't recommend Graeber's book highly enough. He had such a keen understanding of this problem and wrote about it in a way that's both informative and entertaining.</p>  <p>I talk about this in more detail in Chapter 17 of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1098117697/technometria-20">Learning Digital Identity</a> when I discuss <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/authentic_digital_relationships.shtml">authentic digital relationships</a>.</p>     <p>Photo Credit: <a>Playing Kerplunk</a> from DALL-E (public domain) Prompt: Draw a picture of a boy and girl playing kerplunk that's 1200x500 pixels</p>

<p><a href="https://myadcenter.google.com/controls?hl=ja">Googleマイアドセンター</a>は、Googleがユーザーのオンライン行動から収集した情報を基に、ユーザーのプロフィールを推定し、それを本人に開示するためのプラットフォームです。主な特徴は以下の通りです。</p>



 
 興味関心カテゴリ: Googleがユーザーのウェブ閲覧履歴などから推定した、ユーザーの興味関心のあるカテゴリを表示します。 



 人口統計情報: 年齢層や性別など、Googleが推定したユーザーの人口統計情報を確認できます。 



 広告設定: ユーザーは自分のプロフィール情報に基づいたパーソナライズド広告の表示を管理・オプトアウトできます。 



 情報の透明性: Googleがユーザーをどのように認識しているかを本人が確認できるため、情報収集の透明性が高まります。 



 プライバシー管理: ユーザーはマイアドセンターから、Googleによる情報収集・利用に関するプライバシー設定を変更できます。 
 



<p>マイアドセンターは、Googleがユーザーをどのように理解しているかを本人に開示することで、情報の透明性を高め、ユーザーのプライバシー管理を促進するためのツールです。ユーザーは自分のプロフィールを確認し、必要に応じて設定を変更することで、パーソナライズド広告などのサービスを自分の好みに合わせて管理できます。</p>



<p>というわけで、早速行って、Googleが膨大な情報をつかってわたしをどのように認識しているかを見てみましょう！<a href="https://myadcenter.google.com/controls?hl=ja">みなさんもご一緒に</a>。</p>



<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.sakimura.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-40.png?ssl=1"></a>（図表１）Googleはわたしを女性、18〜34歳、独身 etc とみなしているようだ（出所）Google



<p>どうやら、Googleさんは私のことを18〜34歳女性、独身、大企業所属と認識しているようですw。このくらいの女性って、プライバシーを守るために画面の右上に出ているような老人男性のアバターを使う傾向があるのでしょうか…。なお、正解はアラ還暦既婚男性中小企業所属です。<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2024/03/5691/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-5691" title="Googleの肩をちょっと持つと、娘と一緒に旅行の検索とかしてたからそういうのが影響してるかも。娘のプロファイルに合わせると、大当たりなんで。アンドロイドの方はパーソナライズド広告オフにしてるし、Youtubeは別のChromeプロファイルでやってるし。">1</a></p>



<p>みなさんはどう出ましたか？面白いのが出たら、ぜひコメントに書き込んでください。</p>

 追伸 



<p>ちなみに、Googleがユーザーの興味関心カテゴリを推定する際には、主に以下の情報源が使われているとのことです。</p>



 
 検索履歴: ユーザーがGoogleで検索したキーワードやフレーズから、関心のあるトピックを推定します。 



 ウェブ閲覧履歴: Googleアナリティクスを導入しているサイトを訪問した際の閲覧履歴から、ユーザーの興味関心を推測します。 



 YouTubeの視聴履歴: ユーザーがYouTubeで視聴した動画の内容から、関心のあるカテゴリを割り出します。 



 Googleアカウントの情報: ユーザーがGoogleアカウントに登録した情報（年齢、性別、職業など）も、興味関心の推定に活用されます。 



 Androidデバイスの使用履歴: Androidスマートフォンやタブレットを使用している場合、インストールしているアプリやアプリの利用状況から興味関心を推測します。 



 位置情報: ユーザーの位置情報から、よく訪れる場所やその場所に関連するカテゴリを推定します。 
 



<p>これらの情報を機械学習アルゴリズムで分析することで、Googleはユーザーの興味関心カテゴリを自動的に推定しています。ただし、ユーザーがプライバシー設定でこれらの情報の収集を制限している場合は、推定の精度が下がる可能性があります。</p>



<p>また、興味関心カテゴリは定期的に更新されるため、ユーザーの関心の変化に合わせてカテゴリも変化していきます。</p>



<p>しかし、行動からのプロファイリングってうまくいかないものなんですね。わたしの場合はまぁ良いですが、こうした間違ったプロファイリングはプライバシー上の被害を産むこともありますから、きちんとチェックしたいものです。　</p>

<p>Back to this week’s meetup. My colleague <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/istanton">Ian Stanton</a> of <a href="https://tembo.io" title="Tembo: Goodbye Database Sprawl, Hello Postgres">Tembo</a> gave a great
talk, “Building Trunk: A Postgres Extension Registry and CLI”, that provided
background on the motivations and problems that inspired the creation of
<a href="https://pgt.dev" title="trunk: A Postgres Extension Registry">trunk</a>, a binary packaging system for Postgres extensions.</p>
<p>The presentation was followed by 35+ minutes of questions, discussion, and
brainstorming, which I’ve summarized below. But first, links!</p>

<p>Now down to business.</p>
 Introduction 
 
 I opened the meeting and introduced Ian Stanton. 
 
 Presentation 
 
 
<p>Ian introduced himself and <a href="https://pgt.dev" title="trunk: A Postgres Extension Registry">trunk</a>, “an extension registry and CLI
supporting <a href="https://cloud.tembo.io">Tembo Cloud</a>. Wants to tell a story, starting with backstory.</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://tembo.io" title="Tembo: Goodbye Database Sprawl, Hello Postgres">Tembo</a> founded November 2022, provide managed Postgres solution called
<a href="https://cloud.tembo.io">Tembo Cloud</a>. Idea is Postgres can be used for so many different things
through the power of extensions, so built use-case optimized “stacks”
flavors of Postgres powered by extensions and configurations. Super proud of
them, including <a href="https://tembo.io/docs/product/stacks/transactional/message-queue" title="tembo Docs: Message Queue">Message Queue</a>, for which we build an open-source
extension.</p>
 
 
<p>Envisioned ability to install any extension, including user-provided
extensions. Knew we’d need an extension management solution. So we built it.</p>
 
 
<p>It’s called <a href="https://pgt.dev" title="trunk: A Postgres Extension Registry">trunk</a>, an extension registry and CLI, an open-source app for
the community that hosts binary packages for extensions, and powers Tembo
Cloud’s extension management.</p>
 
 
<p>Q1 2023 had build Tembo CLoud v1 with all extensions bundled in containers.
But wanted way to install them on the fly, ideally with installable packages.
Explored the ecosystem for tool we could use.</p>
 
 
<p>PGXN first we found. Love it, backed by the community, been around since
2011, but hosted source code, not binaries. Also little development since 2012.</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Apt" title="PostgreSQL packages for Debian and Ubuntu">Apt</a> and <a href="https://yum.postgresql.org" title="PostgreSQL Yum Repository">Yum</a> repositories are community-backed and are binaries, just what we
wanted, but smaller subset of extensions relative to the 1000s available.
Thought it would be too time-consuming to add them all through the community
process.</p>
 
 *Steven Miller: in chat: “Also with apt packaging, it requires to
install to a specific path, but we needed to customize the install
path based on what pg_config shows for share lib and package lib dir.
That way we could persist extension installations on tembo cloud” 
 
 
 
<p>Weighed pros and cons of building one. Pros:</p>
 
 Full control over integration with Tembo Cloud 
 Binary distribution 
 We could build new features quickly 
 We could publish new extensions quickly 
 
<p>Cons:</p>
 
 How will the community react? 
 Recreating the wheel? 
 
 
 
<p>Expected to publish 2–3 extension a day, only do-able with a solution we
built.</p>
 
 
<p>Want to build something meaningful for Tembo Cloud and the community.</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://registry.astronomer.io">Astronomer Registry for Airflow</a>: Built by Astronomer to find modules
for Airflow, very well received by the community.</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://pgxn.org" title="PGXN — PostgreSQL Extension Network">PGXN</a>, <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Apt" title="PostgreSQL packages for Debian and Ubuntu">Apt</a>, and <a href="https://yum.postgresql.org" title="PostgreSQL Yum Repository">Yum</a> repos: Wanted to take the best of them and build on
it.</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://crates.io" title="The Rust community’s crate registry">crates.io</a>: Wanted a similar great experience for Postgres extensions.</p>
 
 
<p>Vision boiled down to discoverability, categories, ratings system,
certification, and indexing of cloud provider support.</p>
 
 
<p>Want to package any extension, whether SQL, C/SQL, or <a href="https://github.com/pgcentralfoundation/pgrx" title="Build Postgres Extensions with Rust!">pgrx</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>Simple experience, like <code>cargo publish</code> and <code>cargo install cargo-pgrx</code>.</p>
<p>Eric in chat: “❤️”</p>
 
 
<p>Hopes and Dreams: had idea people would magically show up, contribute to the
code, and publish their extensions. Wanted to support multiple platforms,
architectures, and Postgres versions, and for it to be a one-stop shop for
Postgres extensions.</p>
 
 
<p>How it works.</p>
 
 
<p>CLI and Registry, written in Rust, uses Docker to build extensions. Packages
named <code>&lt;trunk-project-name&gt;-&lt;version&gt;-&lt;pg-version&gt;.tar.gz</code>. Published with
<code>trunk publish</code> and installed with <code>trunk install</code>, putting all the files in
the right places.</p>
 
 Steven Miller in chat: “The approach to use docker for building has
been nice. It allows for cross-compile, for example, building for any
platform docker supports with the —platform flag” 
 
 
 
<p>Registry stores metadata and service web site and API, and uses S3 bucket
for the tar-gzip files.</p>
 
 
<p>Example building <a href="https://pgxn.org/dist/semver" title="semver on PGXN">semver</a> extension:</p>

***************************
* POST INSTALLATION STEPS *
***************************

Install the following system-level dependencies:
        On systems using apt:
            libc6

Enable the extension with:
       CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS semver CASCADE;
</code>  <p>CLI pulls down the tar-gzip, unpacks it, and puts the files in the right
places and tells the users what other commands are needed to enable the
extension.</p>
 
 
<p>Pause to take a sip of water.</p>
 
 David Wheeler (he/him) in chat: “STAY HYDRATED PEOPLE!” 
 
 
 
<p>State of the project. Trunk powers extension management for Tembo Cloud, 200
extensions on the platform, install and enable on the fly. Tembo Cloud likely
trunk’s #1 user.</p>
 
 
<p>Get lots of site traffic, especially around categorization, addresses the
discoverability problem set set out to solve.</p>
 
 Jeremy S in chat: “Interested in insights from site traffic - you
mentioned that ‘categorization’ was popular - any other things that
traffic patterns seem to suggest you might have done really well, or
clearly is needed?” 
 
 
 
<p>But pretty minimal community involvement, out fault for not involving the
community early on.</p>
 
 
<p>Did we solve the problem?</p>
 
 For Tembo Cloud: yes! Trunk is core component of the Tembo Cloud
platform that lest us offer high number of extensions. 
 For the community: no! But helped bring more awareness to the
opportunities to improve the ecosystem as a community. 
 Saw other solutions arise around the same time, including <a href="https://database.dev" title="The Database Package Manager">dbdev</a> and
<a href="https://pgxman.com/" title="npm for PostgreSQL">pgxman</a>, and Yurii at <a href="https://omnigres.com" title="Omnigres: Postgres as a Platform">Omnigres</a> is working on something as well. Huge
opportunity to solve this together. 
 Steven Miller in chat: “I think it is very nice way to install other
extensions via an extension how dbdev works” 
 David Wheeler (he/him) in chat: “GRANT!” 
 Grant Holly in chat: “Oh hi” 
 
 
 
<p>Lessons Learned</p>
 
 
<p>It’s a really hard problem to solve! As you add more layers of
complexity, like different architectures, versions of Postgres,
it gets harder and harder.</p>
 
 
<p>Steven Miller in chat, Replying to “The approach to use …”: “The
downside for this approach includes missing chip-specific
instruction support, for example AVX512, which optimizes performance
on some extensions. However if you are building with docker on the
same architecture as the host, then it still includes these
instructions.”</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him) in chat, Replying to “The approach to use
…” “Also presumably no support for building for non-Linux
platforms, yes?”</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>The extension ecosystem truly is the wild west, not really best
practices around building, versioning, and releasing, and when you’re
collecting and housing them, it makes things difficult. A huge
opportunity for us to come up with those standards and share them with
the community.</p>
 
 
<p>Community involvement is crucial, wish we’d done it better early on,
that’s why we’re all here today! Solution to build together doesn’t
happen if we don’t tackle it as a community.</p>
 
 
<p>Similarly, wish we’d reached out to folks like David and Devrim early
on, to get more insight from them and bring the community into the
project from the beginning</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>The future of trunk</p>
 
 
<p>Registry and CLI will continue to serve Tembo Cloud</p>
 
 
<p>Has paved the way for binary packaging and distribution in PGXN v2 that
David is spearheading, will at least will inform and perhaps be the
basis for that part of the project.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>That’s all, thank you, back to you, David!</p>
 
 
 Discussion 
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): Thanks for history an context, Ian! Questions or
discussion topics? Some comments in the thread from Steven and Tobias.</p>
 
 
<p>Tobias Bussmann: in chat: speaking of paths: it would be super helpful
if postgresql would support loading extensions from additional paths
beside the $SHAREDIR/extension and $PKGLIBDIR directories. At least
following directory symlinks within…</p>
 
 
<p>Steven Miller in chat, Replying to “The approach to use …”: I tried
to make it work for Mac, for example, but the docker support didn’t work
basically. I think it might work for Windows, since they have better
container support. However I didn’t try that yet.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): Reads Tobias’s comment. You can specify a
subdirectory in the <code>sharedir</code> and maybe the <code>moduledir</code>? But it’s a
little hinky right now. Steve, do you want to talk about the us of Docker to
build images?</p>
 
 
<p>Steven Miller: Yeah, I’d love to. To Tobias’s point, agree, on Tembo Cloud,
we have a persistent directory where wer’re sintalling extensions, but
because there is no way for an extra <code>sharedir</code> or package dir, we’re
persisting all of the library files, including Postgres core. Not ideal,
especially for upgrades.</p>
<p>Approach for building ind Docker: been nice, do the build ina Dockerfile,
start the container, then install and compare the difference between layers
and zip up all the new files. Great for cross-compile but, not working for
mac or other systems. Will need a fallback option to do a local build.</p>
 
 Jeremy S: in chat, Replying to “speaking of paths: i…”: Exactly same
point was also mentioned just this morning on slack by Matthias 
 
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): Makes sense, thanks. What other bits do you feel
like could be useful for packaging binaries at a community level?</p>
 
 
<p>Steven Miller: Sometimes we install binaries with trunk, but then difficult
to know what has been installed. Nothing like apt where there is a history
of what is installed or uninstall. Would be nice to do something like <code>trunk list</code> and see everything that has been installed. Also, future should be not
just install but management, including turning extensions on, and there are
a lot of ways to turn them on.</p>
 
 
<p>Ian Stanton: <code>uninstall</code> would be useful, too.</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): Other questions about trunk or challenges to binary
distribution it brings?</p>
 
 
<p>*Tobias Bussmann in chat, Replying to “speaking of paths: i…”: this
would allow an immutable PostgreSQL base package and still allow to
install extensions on top. This is esp. important if you need to have
singned packages like on macOS</p>
 
 
<p>*nils in chat, Replying to “speaking of paths: i…”: Guess there is
some prior art in how search_path in pg work, or the PATH in unix’s.</p>
<p>Should be doable to allow to specify some kind of ordered search path,
where Postgres will look for extensions. That way, Postgres can protect
it’s own libs to no be overwritten by external libs, but allow for
loading them from extra paths.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Yurii: There is <code>CREATE EXTENSION</code> and other extensions like logical
decoding plugins. Does trunk handle them?</p>
 
 
<p>Steven Miller: We think of it as four types extensions into 2x2 matrix: 1.
Does it require <code>CREATE EXTENSION</code> true or false; and 2. Does it have a
loadable library true or false. The false/false category is output plugins;
The true/true category, e.g. <code>pg_partman</code>, <code>pg_cron</code>; <code>CREATE EXTENSION</code> false
and loadable library true, e.g., <code>autoexplain</code>, just a library, no upgrade
concerns; and then <code>CREATE EXTENSION</code> true and loadable library false is the
default case.</p>
 
 
<p>Ian Stanton: Steven wrote <a href="https://tembo.io/blog/four-types-of-extensions">a blog</a>
on this.</p>
 
 
<p>Eric in chat: Does pgrx make the process of building easier or harder
and is there anything we can do today to make rust extension building
better?</p>
 
 
<p>Jason Petersen in chat: Yeah, it sounds like we need some sort of
system database like apt has; would enable management, uninstall,
version list, whether upgrades are available, etc</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Yurii: That would be great. What other modules are there without extensions,
like <code>autoexplain</code>?</p>
 
 
<p>Ian Stanton: auth delay is another, base backup to shell, considered parts of
postgres, but we have trouble categorizing them. There are 10-15 I’ve come
across.</p>
 
 
<p>Yurii: ARe these categories on Tembo, can you click a button?</p>
 
 
<p>Ian Stanton: Not a category, but would be a good one to add.</p>
 
 
<p>Steven Miller in chat: This one! <a href="https://tembo.io/blog/four-types-of-extensions">https://tembo.io/blog/four-types-of-extensions</a></p>
<p>It’s in the API metadata</p>
<p>Sorry if I mispronounced your name Tobias</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him) in chat: SAME</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Yurii: Did you say output plugins are handled with Tembo:</p>
 
 
<p>Steven Miller: YOu can install them with trunk, yes.</p>
 
 
<p>Yurii: And you have the build pipeline that will work without plugins too,
yeah, cool.</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): Tobias, did you want to say more about the path
issues?</p>
 
 
<p>Tobias Bussmann: Sure! We are building the Postgres.app, distribution for
macOS, working different from Linux systems. We distribute some extensions
directly, but also allow building and installing extensions on it. Works
nicely, even with pgxn client, but it’s built within the application, which
breaks the code signature.</p>
<p>We always have to fight against a breaking system to allow that. Possible,
but would be much cleaner to specify an extra directory where extensions
could be loaded, and we could distribute packages with binary extensions
that the user could download and install separately from the Postgres.app.</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): You’re not suggesting a different directory for
every extension with a module, but just another path in the search path
that’s not subject to the signature verification.</p>
 
 
<p>Tobias Bussmann: Yes, that would be an option, but with a flexible system
could use one per extension or just specify a second directory. Contrib
extensions sometimes seen as part of Postgres, and they’re all stuffed in
the same directory with third party extensions, which gets confusing and
hard to manage.</p>
 
 Steven Miller in chat: In the previous extensions mini summit, Yuri
mentioned that he was working on a patch to postgres for extra libdir,
extra share dir, but I have not been tracking this one 
 
 
 
<p>nils: That’s what I was saying in chat, there is prior art in Postgres and
Unix systems where you can specify a search path in postgres for a list of
schemas, and in Unix the path is to find binaries. Give me a delimited list
of directories on my system. Could be super user only, where they can
specify where they’re installed, and we can go through the list ot find an
extension.</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): I might be imagining this, but I seem to recall
there was a proposal to have extensions in their own directories, which
would be nice for packaging, but then every time you add one you have to add
another directory to the list and there is some fear the lookup time could
be too long.</p>
 
 
<p>Jeremy S in chat, replying to “speaking of paths: i…”: (Or like
LD_LIBRARY_PATH )</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him) in chat, replying to “speaking of paths: i…”:
LD_LIBRARY_PATH is all but dead on macOS</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Jason Petersen: If it happens at startup I can’t imagine that being a
concern. If the list changes you reboot. It’s not gonna be a performance
problem, I hope.</p>
 
 
<p>*David Wheeler (he/him): Or HUP it if you don’t want downtime.</p>
 
 
<p>Jason Petersen: Sure, but it doesn’t need to be on every command.</p>
 
 
<p>*David Wheeler (he/him): Eric, do you want to pose your question about pgrx?</p>
 
 
<p>Eric: Sure. Wanted to know, were there stumbling blocks to get pgrx support
built into trunk, and does it make things easy or difficult? Different from
C path, are there things we could do to make things easier today?</p>
 
 
<p>Ian Stanton: Yeah, I think the issue is mostly on our end. We have a
separate image for each version of pgrx, and keeping up with the releases is
challenging. We need to rethink our image building strategy. Shouldn’t be
one image for each version of pgrx. That’s the biggest thing I’ve noticed,
mostly on our side.</p>
 
 
<p>*David Wheeler (he/him): Because you need the install the version of pgrx
that the extension requires before you do the build, and that’s just too slow?</p>
 
 
<p>Ian Stanton: Could be too slow. We’ve known about this problem for some
time, just hasn’t been addressed yet.</p>
 
 
<p>Eric: Okay, maybe we can talk about it offline one day, be happy to chat. I
think we’re close to being able to have the CLI, cargo-pgrx, be a different
version than whatever version the extension uses.</p>
 
 
<p>Ian Stanton: That would be super useful!</p>
 
 
<p>Eric: Yeah, I think we’re close to being at that point, if not there
already. We can talk about that offline.</p>
 
 
<p>Ian Stanton: Nice! We’ll reach out in Discord.</p>
 
 
<p>*David Wheeler (he/him): Other comments or questions, or people who have
worked on other kinds of binary registry things, would love to hear more
from other perspectives. Devrim is going to talk about the Yum repository
next week [ed. correction: in two weeks].</p>
 
 
<p>Steven Miller in chat: Daniele last time mentioned Pip is good example of
mixing source and binary distributions</p>
 
 
<p>Eric: I have a random question related to this. In the past and recent
history, has hackers talked about some way of storing extension in the
database rather than relying on the file system?</p>
 
 
<p>*David Wheeler (he/him): Yes! In <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/flat/m2r49a5uh8.fsf_-_%402ndQuadrant.fr#3ceccb32533e81a1be084122ebf8d96f">this long thread from 2011</a> [ed.
Correction: 2013] Dimitri was proposing a “unit”, a placeholder name, where
the object would be stored in the database. Very long thread, I didn’t read
the whole thing, lot of security challenges with it. If it needs a shared
object library loading having to be written to the file system it’s just not
going to happen. I don’t know whether that’d be required or not.</p>
<p>Dimitri also worked on a project called <a href="https://github.com/dimitri/pginstall">pginstall</a> where you could install
extensions from the database like <a href="https://database.dev" title="The Database Package Manager">dbdev</a>, but not just TLEs, but anything.
The idea is a build farm would build binaries and the function in the
database would go to the registry and pull down the binaries and put them
in the right places on the file system.</p>
<p>There were a lot of interesting ideas floating around, but because of the
legacy of the PGXS stuff, it has always been a bit of a struggle to decide
not to use it, to support something not just on the machine, but do
something over libpq or in SQL. Lot of talk, not a lot of action.</p>
 
 
<p>*Tobias Bussmann in chat in response to “In the previous ex…”: still
searching on hacker for it. Meanwhile I found:
<a href="https://commitfest.postgresql.org/5/170/">https://commitfest.postgresql.org/5/170/</a></p>
 
 
<p>Steven Miller in chat: That approach is very awesome (install via
extension)</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Eric: I can see why it would take some time to sort it all out. One thing to
require super user privileges to create an extension, but also having root
on the box itself? Yeah.</p>
 
 
<p>Yurii: TLE plugs into that a little bit for a non-shared object. Not exactly
storing it in the database, but does provide a SQL based/function method of
installing from inside the database, but only for trusted languages, not
shared objects.</p>
 
 
<p>*David Wheeler (he/him): <code>dbdev install</code> does download it from database.dev
and stores it in the database, and has hooks into the <code>CREATE EXTENSION</code>
command and pulls it out of its own catalog. Was a similar model with
<code>pginstall</code>, but with binary support, too.</p>
 
 
<p>Yurii: Back to trunk. When you start building, and have to deal with
binaries, pgxn you can put the source up there, but I want to get to the
whole matrix of all the different versions. Every extension author does it a
little different. Some extensions have versions for Postgres 15, another for
14, some have the same version across all the majors, sometimes an extension
works for some majors and others. Has trunk expanded to other Postgres
versions to support the whole exploding matrix of stuff that does and
doesn’t work, 5-6 majors, gets to be a large matrix, a lot to keep track of.
How’s that working out for the builds and managing that matrix.</p>
 
 Steven Miller in chat: Dimensions I think are:
 
 pg version 
 architecture 
 chip-specific instructions (edge case for native builds?) 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Steven Miller in chat: We just announced support for 14 and 16</p>
<p>David Wheeler (he/him) in chat, replying to “Dimensions I think a…”: OS,
OS version</p>
 
 
<p>Steven Miller in chat,: Replying to “Dimensions I think a…”: Ah right</p>
 
 
<p>Ian Stanton: Steven do you want to take that one?</p>
 
 
<p>Steven Miller: Oh yeah. We’ve started toe-dipping on this one. Started with
Tembo Cloud’s platform, but have no released Postgres 14 and 16, and also
trunk has built-in support for other architectures, such as arm, or whatever
the Docker <code>--platform</code> flag supports. We looked at mac builds, not working
yet, might work for Windows, which ahs better container support, but I don’t
know, and also there is an edge case for pg_vector especially, which
compiles to include ship-specific instructions for AVX512, which helps with
vector. So that’s another dimension to consider.</p>
 
 
<p>Yurii: Part of the idea behind this forum is to see if we can chart a path
forward, maybe not solve everything. What can we solve, how can we make
something a little better for Postgres at large?</p>
 
 
<p>Eric in chat: Even as a Mac user I don’t know the answer to this…
what’s the common Postgres package there?  Postgres dot app, homebrew,
something else?</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him) in chat: <a href="https://github.com/theory/pgenv">pgenv</a>! (self-promotion)</p>
 
 
<p>Eric in chat: I assume folks don’t use macOS in prod but developers are important too</p>
 
 
<p>nils in chat, Replying to “Even as a Mac user I…”:</p>
 <code>$ git clone ..
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install
</code> <p>At least that is what I do 😄</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Steven Miller: In my opinion, the way to approach it is to know all the
dimensions you need, and in the metadata API say which binaries are
available. Then get through it with testing and badging If we let things get
built, to what extent is it tested and used? That can help. Daniele was in
the previous call, said we could look to Pip and Wheel files for
inspiration, and Adam on our team has said the same. This is something that
has some binary and some source, and falls back on doing the build when it
needs to.</p>
 
 
<p>*David Wheeler (he/him): I’ve been thinking about this quite a bit lately.
Can see needing to take advantage of multiple platforms available through
GitHub workflow nodes or the <a href="https://buildfarm.postgresql.org">community’s build farm</a>, which has a vast
array of different architectures and platforms to build stuff. There are
precedents!</p>
<p>I imagine a system where, when something is published on PGXN, another
system is notified and queues it up to all its build farm members to build
binaries, ideally without full paths like trunk, and making them available
for those platforms. Building out that infrastructure will take a fair bit
of effort, I think. With cross-compiling is available it might be…doable?
But most modules and for SQL and maybe Rust or Go extensions, but a
challenge for C extensions.</p>
<p>This is a problem I’d like us to solve in the next year or two.</p>
 
 
<p>Steven Miller in chat, replying to “I assume folks don’t…”: Yeah
exactly, like trunk install after brew install postgres</p>
 
 
<p>Tobias Bussmann in chat, replying to “Even as a Mac user…”: this
seems to be quite spread. There are also people that prefer docker based
installs</p>
 
 
<p>Eric in chat: pgrx supports cross compilation</p>
<p>With a caveat or two!</p>
 
 
<p>Eric in chat, replying to “Even as a Mac user I…” @nils same. For v9.3
though 16!</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>*David Wheeler (he/him): What else? Reading the comments.</p>
 
 
<p>Yurii: I think maybe that PGXN JSON file, I know you’ve been spending time
on it, David, including the <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/03/extension-namespace-rfc/" title="Extension Registry Namespacing RFC">proposal on namespacing</a> a few days ago. That
feels like it could be helpful to be part of this. IF it could be something
we could center around… The first time I wanted to put an extension on PGXN,
it took me a long time to figure out that JSON file. I didn’t find the blog
post that goes through it in nice detail till like two weeks after. If I’d
found it sooner I could have skipped so many things I tried to figure out on
my own.</p>
<p>If we can center around that file, it’ll draw more attention to it, more
links back to it, more examples people blog about here and there, it helps
going forward. The trick is getting it right not being this massive thing no
one can figure out, or has too many options, but hits all the points we
need.</p>
 
 
<p>nils in chat, replying to “Even as a Mac user I…”: Well, mostly for
extension, for Postgres I rely on David’s pgenv</p>
 
 
<p>*Eric * in chat, replying to “Even as a Mac user I…”: @Tobias Bussmann
hmm. Makes it difficult to get an extension installed.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>*David Wheeler (he/him): I’ve been thinking about this a lot, drafted a doc
some of my colleagues at Tembo have read over and I hope to publish soon
[ed. Note: <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/03/rfc-pgxn-metadata-sketch/" title="RFC: PGXN Metadata Sketch">now published</a>], thinking through what a v2 of the <a href="https://pgxn.org/spec/">PGXN Meta
Spec</a> might include. I think we should extend with list of external libraries
required, or the architectures it supports, or it’s a loadable library or an
app that doesn’t even go into the database.</p>
<p>I would like soon to draft an actual revision of the spec, and document it
well but also turn it into a JSON Schema document so we can automate
publishing it and verification in the same place. I also imagine building an
eventual replacement or evolution of the PGXN client or trunk client or some
client that you can use to manage that thing. I think pgrx does that, adding
metadata via the client rather than parse and understand the whole file.</p>
<p>I’m with you it could get really complicated, but I’m not sure I see an
alternative other than building good tooling to minimize the pain.</p>
 
 
<p>Ian Stanton: I think automatically pulling that information when it’s
readily available would be super helpful. We use it as an app to just take
care of things for people.</p>
 
 
<p>*David Wheeler (he/him): Right, and then if we’re successful in getting it
done it’s getting people to take up the tools and start using them. There’s
only so much we can infer. I can tell how to do a build if there’s a
<code>Makefile</code> or a <code>configure</code> file or a <code>cargo.toml</code>, but that doesn’t reveal
what libraries are required. This is why there’s a lot of hand-tuning of
RPM and Apt spec files.</p>
 
 
<p>Steven Miller in chat: We are calling this “system dependencies”</p>
<p>Ssl and glibc the main ones 🙂</p>
 
 
<p>Jason Petersen in chat: And sometimes the package names aren’t even
1—1 mappings</p>
 
 
<p>Eric in chat: Ha!  Try relying on elasticsearch as a runtime
dependency!  😞</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Yurii: That’s another thing to touch on. A lot of extensions are just a thin
layer of glue between Postgres and some OSS library that someone else
maintains. But the trick, when you want to build a Yum package, the
dependency has a different name than the rest of the RedHat ecosystem vs.
the Debian ecosystem. So part of what Devrim has to do to maintain the RPM
packages is manually sort all that out, because you can’t automatically…
libc! It’s called <code>glibc</code> in RedHat and just <code>libc</code> in Debian, and every
package has slightly different names. Do how do you manage that in trunk? Do
you pull the source for any dependencies? Does your Docker image…I don’t
know how this is working.</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him) in chat: I want to build a json schema
validation extension in Rust using
<a href="https://github.com/Stranger6667/jsonschema-rs">https://github.com/Stranger6667/jsonschema-rs</a> or something</p>
 
 
<p>Tobias Bussmann in chat, replying to “Ha!  Try relying o…”: or V8 🤯</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Ian Stanton: Two sides to that one is build time dependencies, and there
there are runtime dependencies. I just dropped an example for some random
extension. Tthe way we’ve been building this is to write out a <code>Dockerfile</code>
that can include build time dependencies. [hunts for link…]</p>
 
 Ian Stanton in chat: <a href="https://github.com/tembo-io/trunk/blob/main/contrib/age/Dockerfile">https://github.com/tembo-io/trunk/blob/main/contrib/age/Dockerfile</a> 
 
 
 
<p>Ian Stanton: We specify them all there. But for runtime, we don’t know
what’s required until we test the thing. We have stuff in our CI pipelines
to install and enable the extension to see if it works. If it doesn’t, it
will report a missing dependency. Then we know we need to add it to our
Postgres images. Not the best flow for finding these dependencies. Steven,
want to add anything more to the build time dependency piece?</p>
 
 David Wheeler (he/him) in chat, replying to “Ha!  Try relying on …”:
Next version of plv8 released on PGXN will have v8 bundled 
 
 
 
<p>Steven Miller: A lot share the same ones, SSL and glibc, so we just build
with the same versions we run on Tembo Cloud. In the metadata we list all
system dependencies, that’s what we build towards, and include them in the
Docker image. If you pick a different stack, like the Machine Learning
stack, it has all the Python stuff in the base image. We don’t really love
this, but this is something where Python wheel might inspire us, becaus it
has packaging and system dependencies.</p>
 
 
<p>Eric in chat, replying to “I want to build a js…”: I feel like I’ve
seen one already?</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him) in chat, replying to “I want to build a js…”:
GIMME</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Yurii: If you really want to od this right, just like in the RPM
repositories, you have to know what the dependencies are. David, I’m
curious, what your thoughts are, if this is to be done right, there has to
be a way to indicate dependencies in the <code>META.json</code> file, but then I’m
talking about Debian and RedHat, but what about Mac? Windows doesn’t really
have a packaging system. There are BSDs, other places Postgres can run,
probably have to narrow the scope a bit to solve something.</p>
 
 
<p>Tobias Bussmann in chat, responding to “Ha!  Try relying o…” Sounds
promising, but for which architectures? I have good hope for pljs as
replacement for plv8</p>
 
 
<p>Ian Stanton in chat:
<a href="https://github.com/tembo-io/trunk/blob/d199346/contrib/fuzzystrmatch/Trunk.toml#L13">https://github.com/tembo-io/trunk/blob/d199346/contrib/fuzzystrmatch/Trunk.toml#L13</a></p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): Fortunately there are only around 1100 extensions in
the world, a relatively low barrier at this point. Some of these other
things have thousands or millions of extensions.</p>
 
 
<p>Yurii: I guess when you put it that way! But I wasn’t going to go through
all 1000 of them one-at-a-time.</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): No. I posted about this on Ivory a few weeks ago
[ed. correction: he means <a href="https://xoxo.zone/@theory/111983275190519842">on Mastodon</a>]: how does one do this in a
platform-neutral way. There are some emerging standards where people are
trying to figure this stuff out. One is called <a href="https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec" title="purl-spec: A minimal specification for purl a.k.a. a package “mostly universal” URL">purl</a>, where you specify
dependencies by packing URLs, or “purls”, and then it’s up to the installing
client to resolve them vai whatever the packaging system it depends on.</p>
<p>I would assume on Windows we’d have to say “it works great as long as you
use <a href="https://chocolatey.org" title="The Package Manager for Windows">Chocolatey</a>” or something like that. But it’s certainly a difficult
problem. I’m looking forward to your talk about your unique approach to
solving it, Yuriii [ed. note: that’s the May 1 mini-summit], that’s going to
be super interesting.</p>
 
 
<p>David G. Johnston: Ultimately you just crowd sourcing. If we just say “this
is what we call this thing in PostgreSQL world”, then if people need to
compile it on Chocolatey on Windows, they figure it out and contribute it.
Or on Debian or RedHat. Just facilitate crowd-sourcing, metadata in a
database.</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): My initial idea was a global registry that people
contribute to just by editing files in a GitHub repository.</p>
 
 
<p>David G. Johnston: HashiCorp has to have something like that already,
there’s stuff out there, no need to reinvent the wheel. This is a global
problem if we open-source it we can solve it.</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler (he/him): Right. Really appreciate everyone coming. Great
discussion, I appreciate it. In two weeks, Devrim Gündüz is going to talk
about the Yum Community Repository and the challenges of RPMifying
extensions. I had this idea of automating adding extensions to the Yum and
Apt repositories, an Devrim is a little skeptical. So super look forward to
his perspective on this stuff. Two weeks from today at noon [ed.:
America/New_York]. Thanks for coming!</p>
 
 
<p>Eric in chat: Thanks a ton!  This is exciting stuff.</p>
 
 
<p>Tobias Bussmann in chat: Thanks all!</p>
 
 
<p>Grant Holly in chat: Thanks everyone. Great discussion</p>
 
 
<p>Jeremy S: in chat: Thanks david</p>
 
 
<p>Steven Miller in chat: Thanks all! Cya next time</p>
 
 
<p>Jeremy S in chat: Isn’t bagel supposed to come for the end</p>
 
 
<p>Ian Stanton in chat: Thanks all :)</p>

<p>Update 2024-03-22: To compliment high-level discussions on the <a href="https://postgresteam.slack.com/archives/C056ZA93H1A" title="Postgres Slack/#extensions: Extensions and extension-related accessories">#extensions</a>
channel on the <a href="https://pgtreats.info/slack-invite" title="Join the Postgres Slack">Postgres Slack</a>, I also created a <a href="https://github.com/theory/justatheory/pull/4">pull request</a> to make it
easer directly comment to this post point by point. Keep the feedback coming,
and thank you!</p>
<p>Update 2024-03-25: Clarified the definition of “Release” and made
“Maintainers” plural. Thanks to Matthias van de Meent for the suggestions!</p>
 
<p>This post proposes a new metadata standard for extension packaging,
distribution, and delivery, building on the <a href="https://pgxn.org/spec/" title="PGXN Meta Spec - The PGXN distribution metadata specification">PGXN Meta Spec</a> to address its
shortcomings and emerging use cases 12 years on. The goals include:</p>
 
 Don’t break the existing standard, but add to it 
 Add explicit support for different types of Postgres extensions,
such as <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/bgworker.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: Background Worker Processes">background workers</a> and <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/gist-extensibility.html">loadable modules</a> 
 Add additional metadata for curation and automated binary compilation 
 Add hooks for registry and third-party-contributed metadata, including
binary distribution options and stats &amp; reports. 
 
<p>There are two high level categories of metadata, split into two separate
files:</p>
 
 <a>Package Metadata</a> provided by extension package
authors 
 <a>Registry Metadata</a> aggregated by the root registry
from various sources, including data derived from the extension source
code or package metadata, but also trusted third parties such as
packagers, smoke testers, security scanners, and more. 
 
<p>Following community discussion of this proposal, the <a>Package
Metadata</a>  will lead to a draft for PGXN Meta Spec version
2.0.0, while the <a>Registry Metadata</a> will guide the design
and implementation of the Root Registry APIs required to provide it.</p>
 Terms 
<p>Definition of terms as used in this document, because every language and
distribution system uses terms differently. These are ours.</p>
 
 
<p>Extension: a software component that extends the capabilities of a
PostgreSQL database or cluster. Extensions may be <code>CREATE EXTENSION</code>
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createextension.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: “CREATE EXTENSION”">extensions</a>, <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/bgworker.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: Background Worker Processes">background workers</a>, command-line apps, <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/gist-extensibility.html">loadable modules</a>,
shared libraries, and more.</p>
 
 
<p>Package: A collection of extensions that are released, versioned, and
distributed together. Packages may be downloaded directly from version
control repositories or in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archive_file" title="Wikipedia: “Archive file”">archive files</a> generated by a release tag.</p>
 
 
<p>Package Path: Identifies a package, declared in the <a>package
metadata</a> file. A package path should describe both
what the package does and where to find it. Typically, a package path
consists of a repository root path — the directory that contains the
metadata file — and a directory within the repository.</p>
 
 
<p>Repository: The version control repository where the package is
developed, referenced as package path or URL.</p>
 
 
<p>Repository root path: The portion of the package path that corresponds
to the root directory of the version control repository where the package
is developed, and which contains the metadata file. Most package are
defined in their repository’s root directory, so this is usually the
entire path. For example, <code>github.com/example/pgtap</code> is the repository
root path for the package of the same name.</p>
 
 
<p>Source Distribution: The contents of a single package bundled together
with <a>package metadata</a> into distributable archive
file, usually named with the last part of the package path or the main
extension, a dash, and the version, e.g., <code>pgtap-1.14.3.zip</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>Binary Distribution: A binary software distribution of a package,
compiled and packaged for a particular OS version, platform, and hardware
architecture. Examples include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deb_(file_format)" title="Wikipedia: “Deb (file format)”">deb</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPM_Package_Manager" title="Wikipedia: “RPM Package Manager”">RPM</a>, and <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/binary-distribution-format/" title="Python Packaging User Guide: Source distribution format">wheel</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>Release: A single version of the package made available to the public on
PGXN, expressed as the package path, an at sign, and the <a href="https://semver.org" title="Semantic Versioning 2.0.0">semver</a>. Example:
<code>github.com/theory/pgtap@v1.14.3</code>.</p>
 
 
 Package Metadata 
<p>The extension author provides this data as part of a release submitted to the
root registry. The registry itself will not change this data in any way, but
provide it as-is.</p>
 Essentials 
<p>Essential information about the package itself, including its path, name,
version, list of authors, license, etc. Ecosystem applications use this data
for indexing, naming conventions, and display information.</p>
<p>Fields (all required):</p>
 
 Package: A package path uniquely identifying the package (usually the
source repo host name and path; see <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/03/extension-namespace-rfc/" title="Extension Registry Namespacing RFC">this RFC</a>) 
 Name: The name of the extension package, usually the same as the main
extension, not unique but conflicts are resolved by escalation to
<code>package</code> 
 Version: The version of the package, expressed as a <a href="https://semver.org" title="Semantic Versioning 2.0.0">SemVer</a> 
 Abstract: A short description of the purpose of the package 
 Description: A longer description of the package, answering the
question “what is this thing and what value is it?” 
 Maintainers: List of maintainers, each an object with <code>name</code> and either
<code>email</code> or <code>url</code> (or both) 
 License: An <a href="https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/SPDX-license-expressions/" title="Annex D SPDX license expressions (Normative)">SPDX 2.3 license expression</a> comprised of one or more
licenses from the <a href="https://spdx.github.io/license-list-data/" title="PREVIEW - SPDX License List">SPDX License List</a> 
 Spec: Information about the metadata spec itself, a version and URL 
 
<p>Example:</p>
  <code>{
  "package": "github.com/example/pg-pair",
  "name": "pair",
  "version": "1.1.0",
  "abstract": "A key/value pair data type",
  "description": "Adds a key/value pair data type to Postgres, useful for specifying arbitrary key/value function parameters.",
  "maintainers": [
    {
        "name": "Naomi Nagata",
        "email": "naomi@example.com",
        "url": "https://example.com/roci/naomi"
    }
  ],
  "license": "PostgreSQL OR MIT",
  "spec": {
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "url": "https://pgxn.org/meta/spec.txt"
  }
}
</code>  <p>Other possibilities:</p>
 
 License File: An alternative to <code>license</code> for nonstandard licenses
(from <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-license-and-license-file-fields" title="Cargo Manifest Format: The license and license-file fields">cargo</a>) 
 Contributors: List of people who have contributed to the package 
 Emeriti: List of former maintainers and contributors 
 
<p>PGXN Compatibility:</p>
 
 Overloads the string representation of the spec v1 field, but it should be
able to parse either one, especially with the spec version to
differentiate. 
 Uniqueness of <code>package</code> and relationship to <code>name</code> 
 PGXN has <code>maintainer</code>; is it really worth pluralizing it? Maybe we don’t
need it at all, given repository and issue links. 
 
 Artifacts 
<p>A list of links and checksums for downloading the extension package in one or
more formats, including source code, binaries, system packages, and more. Apps
use this information (along with <a>registry metadata</a>) to
determine the best option for installing an extension on a particular system.</p>
<p>This information is optional, and provided in addition to the source code
available from the root registry itself. The idea is that, on release, the
release manager creates artifacts in one or more locations (such as GitHub
releases), and it’s useful to link to them from the registry. Binary builds
may be unlikely today, but leave the option open for now by allowing arbitrary
text in the <code>type</code> field.</p>
<p>Each item must have:</p>
 
 Type: The type of artifact: Source, binary, RPM, etc. 
 URL: Link the the artifact 
 SHA: A SHA checksum 
 
<p>Each URL must properly resolve and the checksum must match.</p>
  <code>[

</code>  <p>PGXN Compatibility:</p>
<p>New object, no conflicts.</p>
 Resources 
<p>External information about the package, mostly links, including source code
repository, bug reporting, documentation, badges, funding, etc. Apps use this
data for links, of course, but also full text indexing, documentation
rendering, and displaying useful information about the extension.</p>
<p>Fields:</p>
 
 Homepage: URL for the package’s home page 
 Issues: URL to issues 
 Documentation: URL to documentation 
 Support: URL to support 
 Repository: Source code repository URL 
 Badges: Array of badge link objects 
 Funding: Array of funding objects

</code>  <p>PGXN Compatibility:</p>
 
 <code>issues</code> replaces <code>bugtracker</code> and is just a URL. Can support either 
 <code>repository</code> is just a URL instead of an object. Can support either
but with the <code>package</code> key referencing the repository path perhaps
we don’t need to change it. 
 
 Contents 
<p>A description of what’s included in the package. Often a package consists of
multiple extensions, such as <a href="https://postgis.net" title="PostGIS">PostGIS</a>, which <a href="https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Apostgis%2Fpostgis+%22default_version+%3D%22&amp;type=code" title="postgis/postgis: control files">includes</a> <code>postgis</code>,
<code>postgis_tiger_geocoder</code>, <code>address_standardizer</code>, and more.</p>
<p>Furthermore, some extensions are not <code>CREATE EXTENSION</code>-type <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createextension.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: “CREATE EXTENSION”">extensions</a> at
all, such as <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/bgworker.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: Background Worker Processes">background workers</a>, command-line apps, <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/gist-extensibility.html">loadable modules</a>,
shared libraries, and more. Each should be listed along with documentation
links where they differ from the package overall (or are simply more
specific).</p>
<p>Fields:</p>
 
 Extensions: Object describing <code>CREATE EXTENSION</code> <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createextension.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: “CREATE EXTENSION”">extensions</a>. Keys
are extension names, fields are objects with the fields <code>sql</code>, <code>doc</code>,
<code>abstract</code>, <code>control</code> (same as control file, but can use the file itself),
<code>tle</code> (meaning it can be used as a <a href="https://github.com/aws/pg_tle" title="pg_tle: Framework for building trusted language extensions for PostgreSQL">trusted language extension</a>), and
<code>preload</code> (to indicate whether its libraries need to be loaded in advance
via <code>shared_preload_libraries</code>, <code>session_preload_libraries</code>, or
<code>local_preload_libraries</code>). 
 Workers: Object describing background workers. Keys are worker names,
fields are objects with the fields <code>bin</code>, <code>doc</code>, and <code>abstract</code>. 
 Apps: Object describing applications, command-line or otherwise. Keys
are app names, fields are objects with the fields <code>bin</code>, <code>doc</code>, and
<code>abstract</code>. 
 Modules: Object describing <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/gist-extensibility.html">loadable modules</a> that can be loaded into
Postgres (not necessary for extensions that include libraries). Keys are
module names, fields are objects with the fields <code>lib</code> (without file
extension), <code>doc</code>, <code>abstract</code>, and <code>preload</code>. 
 Libraries: Other libraries that may ship in the package and need to be
installed but are not <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/gist-extensibility.html">loadable modules</a>, such as a dynamic library used
by an app. Keys are library names, fields are objects with the fields
<code>lib</code> (without file extension) or <code>dir</code> (for a directory of files), <code>doc</code>,
and <code>abstract</code>.

    }
  }
}
</code>  <p>Other options:</p>
 
 Allow or require an array of docs? 
 Specify support for specific doc formats (markdown, manpage, plain text,
MkDocs, etc.)? 
 Support glob patterns? 
 Add libraries as sub-key for workers and apps, e.g. for a Ruby app that
requires a directory of gems? 
 
<p>PGXN Compatibility:</p>
<p>Significantly different from the existing <code>provides</code> object, so key this one
under <code>contents</code> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifest_file" title="Wikipedia: “Manifest file”"><code>manifest</code></a> and continue to support both.</p>
 Dependencies 
<p>A list of external dependencies required to configure, build, test, install,
and run the extensions in the package. These include not only other extension
packages, but also external libraries and system dependencies. And let’s not
forget the versions of Postgres required, as well as any OS and version
dependencies (e.g, does it work on Windows? FreeBSD? What versions?) and
architectures (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AArch64" title="Wikipedia: AArch64">arm64</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amd64" title="Wikipedia: AMD64">amd64</a>, etc.)</p>
<p>Fields:</p>
 
 
<p>platforms: Platforms supported by the package, defined as OS and
architecture. Assume all platforms if none are listed.</p>
 
 
<p>postgres: Versions of PostgreSQL required by the package, specified as
a version range, as well as compiled features (<code>--with-*</code> configure
options)</p>
 
 
<p>pipeline: The build pipeline required to build the extension. Options:
<code>pgxs</code>, <code>meson</code> (?) <code>pgrx</code>, <code>gnu</code> (<code>./configure</code>), <code>gem</code>, <code>cpan</code>, <code>pip</code>,
<code>go</code>, etc.</p>
 
 
<p>prereqs: Object defining external dependencies required for different
phases:</p>
 
 configure: Dependencies to configure the package (e.g., items
required for <code>./configure</code> or <code>make</code> to work) 
 build: Dependencies to build the package (in addition to run
dependencies) 
 test: Dependencies to test the package (in addition to build and
run dependencies) 
 run: Dependencies to run the package 
 develop: Dependencies to develop the package (in addition to all
other phase dependencies) 
 
<p>Each points to an object with at least one of these keys:</p>
 
 requires: Required to use the package 
 recommends: Not required, but recommended as a best practice 
 suggests: Not required, but nice to have 
 conflicts: Package will not work with these items 
 
<p>These, in turn, contain at least one of these keys:</p>
 
 package: Other packages, expressed by their package paths,
pointing to a version expression 
 external: External dependencies not included with the package 
 contrib: List of Postgres contrib or development packages 
 
 
 
<p>variations: A list of dependency variations, each with two fields:</p>
 
 where: Specifies a configuration that, when matched, includes the
dependencies. For example, to specify alternate dependencies for Linux
arm64, it would be <code>"platforms": { "linux": "arm64" }</code>. For a specific
version of Postgres, it would be something like
<code>"postgres": { "version": "&gt;= 16, &lt; 17" }</code>. [This likely needs some
deep thinking through.] 
 dependencies: An object containing of the other key structures in
this object, defining the additional dependencies for environments
that match the <code>where</code> field. 
 
 
 
<p>The <code>packages</code> and <code>external</code> keys point to objects in which the keys are
dependency names and the values are version range expressions (empty string
means any version). The <code>postgres.version</code> field is also a version range
expression.</p>
<p>The <code>contrib</code> key points to an array of Postgres-supplied apps and extensions.
Versions are not necessary because they effectively have the same version as a
supported Postgres version.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
  <code>{
  "postgres": {
    "version": "&gt;= 12, &lt; 17",
    "with": [ "xml", "uuid", "perl" ]
  },
  "pipeline": "pgrx",
  "platforms": {
    "linux": [ "amd64", "arm64" ],
    "darwin": [ "amd64", "arm64" ],
    "windows": [ "amd64" ],
    "freebsd": [ "amd64" ]
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "configure": {
      "requires": {
        "external": { "cargo-pgrx": "" }
      }
    },
    "build": {
      "requires": {
        "external": {
          "curl": "",
          "awk": "",
          "sed": "",
          "perl": "5.20"
        }
      },
      "recommends": {
        "external": {
          "jq": "",
          "perl": "5.38"
        }
      }
    },
    "test": {
      "requires": {
        "contrib": [ "pg_regress", "plpgsql", "plperl" ],
        "packages": {
          "github.com/theory/pgtap": "1.1.0"
        }
      }
    },
    "run": {
      "requires": {
        "contrib": [ "plperl" ],
        "packages": {
          "github.com/theory/hostname": ""
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
</code>  <p>Notes:</p>
<p>The <code>external</code> field is the tricky one. How does one provide a canonical
dependency for a third-party library or app that may have loads of different
names on different platforms, different packaging systems (apt vs rpm), and
even different versions of them, or split apart for development and runtime
use? Some possibilities:</p>
 
 Use <a href="https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec" title="purl-spec: A minimal specification for purl a.k.a. a package “mostly universal” URL">purl</a> and let downstream services handle the conversion 
 Create a rule set that allows one to predict dependency name changes
across ecosystems, similar to <a href="https://github.com/repology/repology-rules" title="Package normalization ruleset for Repology">repology-rules</a> 
 Just use <a href="https://repology.org" title="Repology, the packaging hub">Repology</a>? 
 
<p>Other notes:</p>
 
 Decide on a version range standards to adopt. Start with the <a href="https://pgxn.org/spec/#Version.Ranges" title="PGXN Meta Spec: Version Ranges">PGXN version
range</a>, <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0508/" title="PEP 508 – Dependency specification for Python Software Packages">pep-0508</a>, <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/using-npm/semver#ranges" title="npm docs: semver advanced range syntax">npm ranges</a>, and <a href="https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.5.0/libdoc/rubygems/rdoc/Gem/Version.html">Gem::Version</a>. 
 Is <code>pipeline</code> really necessary, given configure requirements? I think so,
because it tells the client the preferred build system to use, in case it
can’t detect it for some reason. 
 
<p>PGXN Compatibility:</p>
<p>Significantly differs from the existing <code>prereqs</code> object, so this one is keyed
under <code>dependencies</code> and we can support either.</p>
 Classification 
<p>Classification metadata lets the extension developer associate additional
information to improve discovery, such as key words. It might also allow
selections from a curated list of extension classifications, such as the
<a href="https://crates.io/category_slugs" title="crates.io valid category slugs">category slugs</a> supported for the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-categories-field" title="Cargo Manifest Format: The categories field">cargo categories field</a>.</p>
<p>Ecosystem apps use this data to organize extensions under key words or
categories, making it easier for users to find extensions that are frequently
used together or for specific workloads or tasks.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
  <code>{
  "tags": [
    "testing",
    "pair",
    "parameter"
  ],
  "categories": [
    "Machine Learning"
  ]
}
</code>  <p>PGXN Compatibility:</p>
<p>Conflicts with the existing root-level <code>tags</code> array, but we can support either
one.</p>

</code>  <p>Note that PostgresML also provides a dashboard app, but it does not ship with
the extension, so it’s not listed here. It could have its own package metadata
and be separately distributed.</p>
<p>For the Python dependencies, in the absence of a neutral standard for
specifying package, here they’re specified using a syntax borrowed from RPM to
make clear that they’re Python dependencies. A couple of those dependencies
are Linux-only, so listed in <code>variations</code> where the OS is Linux.</p>
 Registry Metadata 
<p>The second metadata format is registry metadata. It starts by with a copy the
<a>package metadata</a>, but builds from there, adding
information (such as the artifact link, SHA, and cryptographic signature from
the registry itself) and sections (defined below).</p>
<p>Providing a separate metadata format enables broader community collaboration
to augment the metadata for extension packages.</p>
<p>Ideally an ecosystem of trusted services will be developed by various parties,
who will report back to the root registry as the source of record for all
metadata about extension packages. For example, a binary distribution service
like <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Apt" title="PostgreSQL packages for Debian and Ubuntu">apt.postgresql.org</a> or <a href="https://pgt.dev" title="Trunk — A Postgres Extension Registry">trunk</a> will submit links and checksums for
binary packages and perhaps periodic download stats.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, there are three typologies for registry metadata:
Distributions, Reports, and Classifications.</p>
 Distributions 
<p>A list of links and checksums for downloading binary distributions for the
extension package. The root registry page for the package can therefore list
all the ways to install an extension and expand the list as new binary
registries add it.</p>
<p>Along with the <a>Artifacts</a> package metadata, the distribution
metadata allows installer tools to select the best option to install based on
the OS, Postgres version, and cluster configuration (e.g., install the
community Apt package if the cluster was installed from the community Apt
registry).</p>
<p>Each item must have:</p>
 
 Registry: The name of the distribution registry, unique 
 Type: The type of distribution: Apt, RPM, TLE, etc. 
 URL: Link to the the registry’s page for the distribution 
 Command: In lieu of a URL and SHA it can provide instructions to
install the distribution, e.g., <code>apt-get install postgresql16-pair</code>. 
 
<p>Each distribution registry must be trusted by the root registry to submit this
information to add to the metadata, and have its own page with additional
contextual information: its home page, docs, basic instructions, whatever. A
README of sorts.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
  <code>[
  {
    "registry": "trunk.pgxn.org",
    "type": "trunk",
    "command": "pgxn install github.com/example/pair"
  },
  {
    "registry": "apt.postgresql.org",
    "type": "apt",
    "command": "apt-get install postgresql16-pair"
  },
  {
    "registry": "yum.postgresql.org",
    "type": "rpm",
    "command": "yum install postgresql16-pair"
  },
  {
    "registry": "pgt.dev",
    "type": "apt",
    "url": "https://pgt.dev/extensions/pair",
    "command": "trunk install pair"
  },
  {
    "registry": "pgxman.com",
    "type": "apt",
    "url": "https://pgxman.com/x/pair",
    "command": "pgxman install pair"
  },
  {
    "registry": "database.dev",
    "type": "sql",
    "url": "https://database.dev/example/pair",
    "command": "SELECT dbdev.install('example-pair');"
  },
]
</code>  <p>Other Options:</p>
 
 Information about installing from a registry that doesn’t offer URLs, like
Homebrew, where one just needs to know what the formula is called. Maybe
the same should apply to Apt? 
 
 Metrics and Reports 
<p>This object includes data such as number of downloads, build and test status
on various Postgres/OS/version combinations, binary packaging distributions,
test coverage, security certification, vulnerability detection, quality
metrics and user ratings, and more. Some of these bits of data might include
badges, e.g., for ratings or security assessments.</p>
<p>In the broader ecosystem, it would be the responsibility of the root registry
to ensure that data comes only from trusted sources. However this data will be
publicly readable, allowing any downstream applications to extend and
publish metrics and reports with their own information.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
  <code>{
    "aggregates": {
      "downloads": 32
    },
    "sources": {
      "smoke-tester.example.com": {
        "stats": {
          "passes": 32,
          "fails": 8,
          "unknown": 0
        },
        "link": "https://smoke-tester.example.com/extension/pair",
        "badge": "https://smoke-tester.example.com/extension/pair.svg"
      },
      "pgt.dev": {
        "downloads": 12,
        "tags": ["two", "kv"],
        "categories": ["Analytics"]
      },
      "pgxman.com": {
        "downloads": 20
      },
      "ratings.example.com": {
        "stats": {
          "ratings": 324,
          "average": 3.2,
          "comments": 13
        },
        "link": "https://ratings.example.com/extension/pair",
        "badge": "https://ratings.example.com/extension/pair.svg"
      },
      "stats.example.com": {
        "contributors": 2,
        "stars": 14,
        "last_active": "2024-01-12",
      },
      "security-scan.example.com": {
        "advisories": {
          "high": 2,
          "moderate": 11,
          "low": 1,
          "cves": 0
        },
        "link": "https://security-scan.example.com/extension/pair",
        "badge": "https://security-scan.example.com/extension/pair.svg"
      }
    }
}
</code>  <p>Notes:</p>
 
 
<p>The <code>aggregates</code> section aggregates results from multiple sources, for
example summing all downloads or averaging ratings. The list of items to
aggregate could evolve regularly.</p>
 
 
<p>Each key in <code>sources</code> identifies a trusted downstream source of
information. Each would have its own schema describing its objects and
their meaning, along with URI templates to link to. For example,
<code>stats.example.com</code> might have these templates:</p>
  <code>{
  "contributors": {
    "alt": "List of people who have contributed to the {name} project",
    "badge": "https://stats.example.com/{ package }/contributors.svg",
    "uri": "https://stats.example.com/{ package }/contributors"
  },
  "stars": {
    "alt": "Star ratings for the {name} project",
    "badge": "https://stats.example.com/{ package }/stars.svg",
    "uri": "https://stats.example.com/{ package }/stars"
  }
}
</code>   
 
<p>Might be worth adopting more of an API of multiple files, rather than one big file.
Example: <a href="https://formulae.brew.sh/docs/api/#analytics" title="Homebrew JSON API Documentation: Analytics">Homebrew analytics</a>. Note also its support for date ranges for analytics
(30/90/365 days, stats when directly installed vs. installed as a dependency).</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/02/decentralized-extension-publishing/" title="Contemplating Decentralized Extension Publishing">brainstormed</a> about decentralized Postgres extension
publishing, inspired in part by an examination of <a href="https://go.dev/doc/modules/developing#decentralized" title="go.dev: Developing and publishing modules">Go decentralized publishing</a>.
It was…a lot. I’ve been deeply <a href="https://www.pgevents.ca/events/pgconfdev2024/schedule/session/91/" title="pgconf.dev: “The Future of the Extension Ecosystem”">pondering the future</a> of PGXN and the
broader extension ecosystem, and want to start to nail down some decisions. To
that end, I’d like to propose an update to extension namespacing.</p>
 Status Quo 
<p>There are currently three ways in which an extension is considered unique:</p>
 
 Only one extension can have a given name within a single Postgres cluster.
Names are defined by the name of the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/extend-extensions.html#EXTEND-EXTENSIONS-FILES" title="PostgreSQL Docs: Extension Files">control file</a>. It is therefore not
possible to have two extensions with the same name in the same Postgres
cluster. 
 <a href="https://pgxn.org" title="PGXN — PostgreSQL Extension Network">PGXN</a> follows this pattern: Only one extension can have a given name in the
PGXN registry. The first person to release an extension then “owns” its
name, and no one else can release an extension with the same name.<a>1</a>
I think <a href="https://database.dev" title="The Database Package Manager">dbdev</a> follows the same pattern. 
 Other registries like <a href="https://pgt.dev" title="Trunk — A Postgres Extension Registry">trunk</a> and <a href="https://pgxman.com/" title="npm for PostgreSQL">pgxman</a> define an extension by the
distribution name, at least for the purposes of selecting a binary to
install. Thus when you <code>trunk install postgis</code>, you get all of the
extensions included, as you’d expect, while
<code>trunk install address_standardizer</code> wouldn’t work at all. In the few places
that <code>trunk</code> supports installation by extension name, it prompts the user to
use the appropriate package name if there’s a conflict. 
 
 A Modest Proposal 
<p>I’d like to propose the following changes to the <a href="https://pgxn.org/spec">PGXN Meta Spec</a> to start to
move away from extension uniqueness in the broader extension ecosystem and more
toward package name.</p>
 
 Add a new field, call it <code>module_path</code>, <code>project_path</code>, <code>project_uri</code>, that,
if present, uniquely identifies an extension project and all of its parts.
It should be to a <a href="https://go.dev/ref/mod#module-path">Go-style module path</a> (or URI) that identifies the
project repository path where a <code>META.json</code> file lives. 
 Retain the <a href="https://pgxn.org/spec#provides" title="PGXN Meta Spec: provides"><code>provides</code></a> object where keys identify extensions, but those
keys will no longer be globally unique to the registry. In other words, the
combination of <code>module_path</code> and extension name uniquely identifies an
extension, including an empty <code>module_path</code>. 
 
 How it Works 
<p>Some examples. Let’s say there is an existing extension named <code>pair</code>, included
in the distribution named <code>pg_pair</code>:</p>
  <code>{
  "name": "pg_pair",
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "provides": {
    "pair": {
      "file": "pair.sql",
      "version": "1.2.0"
    }
  }
}
</code>  <p>The extension name <code>pair</code> is unique, and <code>pgxn install pair</code> will download
the pg_pair v1.2.3 bundle and compile and install pair v1.2.0.</p>
<p>Now someone else comes along and wants to make their own pair with this
metadata:</p>
  <code>{
  "name": "my_pair",
  "version": "0.2.3",
  "provides": {
    "pair": {
      "file": "pair.sql",
      "version": "0.2.3"
    }
  }
}
</code>  <p>Just like today, this upload would be rejected, because there is already a
registered <code>pair</code> extension. Under my proposal, they can disambiguate by
providing a <code>module_path</code>:</p>
  <code>{
  "name": "my_pair",
  "module_path": "github/example/pair",
  "version": "0.2.3",
  "provides": {
    "pair": {
      "file": "pair.sql",
      "version": "0.2.3"
    }
  }
}
</code>  <p>This upload would be allowed. With these two releases, someone attempting to
install <code>pair</code> would see something like this:</p>
  <code>$ pgxn install pair
ERROR: Duplicate extension name “pair”. Install one of these instead:
       * pgxn.org/dist/pair
       * github/example/pair
</code>  <p>Note the the module path <code>pgxn.org/dist/pair</code> in the the first option. This is
the default module path for distributions without a module path.<a>2</a> But
now the user can select the proper one to install:</p>
  <code>$ pgxn install pgxn.org/dist/pair
INFO: latest version: pgxn.org/dist/pair@1.2.3
INFO: building extension
INFO: installing extension
INFO: done!
</code>  <p>Furthermore, the PGXN client will prevent the user from later installing a
conflicting extension. The failure would look something like:</p>
  <code>$ pgxn install github/example/pair
INFO: latest version: pgxn.org/dist/pair@0.2.3
ERROR: Cannot install extension “pair” from pgxn.org/dist/pair:
ERROR: A conflicting extension named “pair” is already installed
ERROR: from pgxn.org/dist/pair
</code>   Features with Benefits 
<p>I see a number of benefits to this change:</p>
 
 Compatibility with the v1 metadata spec, so that no data migration or
distribution indexing is required. 
 It loosens up extension namespacing (or name registration, if you prefer)
while adding additional metadata to help users evaluate the quality of an
extension. For example, does it come from a well-known developer? You can
see it right in the module path. 
 It creates a pattern to eventually allow auto-indexing of extensions. For
example, if you run <code>pgxn install github.com/example/pew</code>, and PGXN doesn’t
have it, it can look for a <code>META.json</code> file in that repository and, if it
exists, and there’s a semver release tag, it could try to index it and let
the user install it. There are ownership issues to be worked out, but it
has possibilities. 
 It preserves the Postgres core concept of extension identity while putting
in place a well-established (by <a href="https://go.dev/ref/mod" title="Go Modules Reference">Go modules</a> and widespread use of URIs in
general) that the Postgres core could eventually adopt to allow more
flexible extension namespacing. 
 
 Request for Comments 
<p>What do you think? Good idea? Terrible idea? Please hit me with your thoughts
<a href="https://xoxo.zone/@theory" title="@theory@xoxo.zone">on Mastodon</a>, or via the <a href="https://postgresteam.slack.com/archives/C056ZA93H1A" title="Postgres Slack/#extensions: Extensions and extension-related accessories">#extensions</a> channel on the <a href="https://pgtreats.info/slack-invite" title="Join the Postgres Slack">Postgres Slack</a>. I’d
like to get this decision (and a few others, stay tuned!) nailed down soon and
start development, so don’t hesitate? I need your help to prevent me from making
a huge mistake.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Unless the owner would like to share ownership with someone else, in
which case they can email me to request that another user be granted
“co-ownership”. They can also request to transfer ownership to another user,
after which the original owner will no longer be able to release the
extension.&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a></p>
 
 
<p>Or, if the <code>META.json</code> file has a <a href="https://pgxn.org/spec#resources" title="PGXN Meta Spec: resources">repository resource</a> with a
URL, PGXN could index it as the implied module path. Or, failing that, maybe
it should fall back on the distribution name instead of a <code>pgxn.org</code> path,
and prompt with <code>pg_pair/pair</code>.&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a></p>

 Introduction 
 
 
<p>Introduced myself, first Mini Summit, six leading up to the <a href="https://www.pgevents.ca/events/pgconfdev2024/schedule/session/191">in-person
summit</a> on May 28 at PGConf.dev in Vancouver, Canada.</p>
 
 
<p>Thought I would get it things started, provide a bit of history of
extensions and context for what’s next.</p>
 
 
 Presentation 
 
 
<p>Postgres has a long history of extensibility, originally using pure SQL or
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-load.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: “LOAD”">shared preload libraries</a>. Used by a few early adopters, perhaps a couple
dozen, including …</p>
 
 
<p>Explicit extension support added in Postgres 9.1 by Dimitri Fontaine, with
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/extend-pgxs.html" title="PostgreSQL Extension Building Infrastructure">PGXS</a>, <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createextension.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: “CREATE EXTENSION”"><code>CREATE EXTENSION</code></a>, and <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/app-pgdump.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: “pg_dump”"><code>pg_dump</code></a> &amp; <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/app-pgrestore.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: “pg_restore”"><code>pg_restore</code></a> support.</p>
 
 
<p>Example <code>pair--1.0.0.sql</code>:</p>
  <code>-- complain if script is sourced in psql and not CREATE EXTENSION
\echo Use "CREATE EXTENSION pair" to load this file. \quit

CREATE TYPE pair AS ( k text, v text );

CREATE FUNCTION pair(text, text)
RETURNS pair LANGUAGE SQL AS 'SELECT ROW($1, $2)::pair;';

CREATE OPERATOR ~&gt; (LEFTARG = text, RIGHTARG = text, FUNCTION = pair);
</code>   
 
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/iambagelkitty/">Bagel</a> makes an appearance.</p>
 
 
<p>Example <code>pair.control</code>:</p>
  <code># pair extension
comment = 'A key/value pair data type'
default_version = '1.0'
module_pathname = '$libdir/pair'
relocatable = true
</code>   
 
<p>Example <code>Makefile</code>:</p>
  <code>EXTENSION    = pair
MODULEDIR    = $(EXTENSION)
DOCS         = README.md
DATA         = sql/pair--1.0.sql
TESTS        = test/sql/base.sql
REGRESS      = base
REGRESS_OPTS = --inputdir=test
MODULES      = src/pair
PG_CONFIG   ?= pg_config

PGXS := $(shell $(PG_CONFIG) --pgxs)
include $(PGXS)
</code>   
 
<p>Build and Install:</p>
  <code>$ make
make: Nothing to be done for `all'.

$ make install
mkdir -p '/pgsql/share/extension'
mkdir -p '/pgsql/share/pair'
mkdir -p '/pgsql/share/doc/pair'
install -c -m 644 pair.control '/pgsql/share/extension/'
install -c -m 644 sql/pair--1.0.sql  '/pgsql/share/pair/'
install -c -m 644 README.md '/pgsql/share/doc/pair/'

$ make installcheck
# +++ regress install-check in  +++
# using postmaster on Unix socket, default port
ok 1         - base                                       15 ms
1..1
# All 1 tests passed.
</code>   
 
<p><code>CREATE EXTENSION</code>:</p>
  <code>$ psql -d try -c 'CREATE EXTENSION pair'
CREATE EXTENSION

$ pg_dump -d try
--
-- Name: pair; Type: EXTENSION; Schema: -; Owner: -
--
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pair WITH SCHEMA public;

--
-- Name: EXTENSION pair; Type: COMMENT; Schema: -; Owner:
--
COMMENT ON EXTENSION pair IS 'A key/value pair data type';
</code>   
 
<p>Many of us saw opportunity in this new feature.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PostgreSQL today is not merely a database, it’s an application development
platform.</p>
<p>—&nbsp;Me, 2010</p>
</blockquote>
 
 
<p>Proposed to build <a href="https://pgxn.org/" title="The PostgreSQL Extension Network">PGXN</a>. Raised funds to build it in late 2010. Launched
site April 2011; <a href="https://www.varrazzo.com">Daniele Varrazzo</a> released CLI, and <a href="https://github.com/guedes">Dickson Guedes</a>
released the dev CLI.</p>
 
 
<p>Problems PGXN set out to solve:</p>
 
 Source code distribution with user registration and namespacing 
 Discovery: Search, read docs, brows tags 
 Installation: CLI to compile and install using PGXS or Configure 
 
 
 
<p>PGXN Components:</p>
 
 <a href="https://pgxn.org/spec/">Meta Spec</a> 
 <a href="https://manager.pgxn.org">Manager</a> 
 <a href="https://pgxn.org/mirroring/">Root Mirror</a>

 <a href="https://pgxn.org/" title="The PostgreSQL Extension Network">Site</a> 
 <a href="https://github.com/pgxn/pgxnclient">Client</a> 
 <a href="https://github.com/pgxn/pgxn-utils">Utils CLI</a> 
 <a href="https://github.com/pgxn/docker-pgxn-tools">CI/CD Image</a> 
 
 
 
<p>Problems out of scope for PGXN:</p>
 
 Binary packaging and distribution
 
 Defer to apt/yum 
 
 
 Developer tooling (though dev utils helped) 
 Build tooling
 
 Defer to core (<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/extend-pgxs.html" title="PostgreSQL Extension Building Infrastructure">PGXS</a>) 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>PGXN Shortcomings:</p>
 
 Little development since 2012 
 Search limitations
 
 Docs preferred 
 Most distributions have few docs 
 Some issues <a href="https://blog.pgxn.org/post/743059495415119873/recent-work" title="PGXN Blog: “Recent PGXN Improvements”">addressed in last few weeks</a> 
 
 
 Source of Record
 
 Minority of available extensions on PGXN 
 Releases uneven or neglected 
 
 
 
<blockquote>
<p>In classic SDLC fashion, PGXN POC shipped as an MVP and was neglected.</p>
<p>— Me, Just Now</p>
</blockquote>
 
 
<p>Been peripheral to Postgres extensions for the last 10-12 years, but some
things have happened.</p>
 
 
<p>Non-Core extension counts:</p>
 
 
 
 
 <a href="https://pgxn.org/about/">PGXN</a>: 382 
 <a href="https://gist.github.com/joelonsql/e5aa27f8cc9bd22b8999b7de8aee9d47">joelonsql/PostgreSQL-EXTENSIONs.md</a>: 1,186 
 
 
 
<p>Daniele asks about that last source, which is just a list in a <a href="https://gist.github.com/joelonsql/e5aa27f8cc9bd22b8999b7de8aee9d47">gist</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>Joe Nelson links to the <a href="https://gist.github.com/joelonsql/e5aa27f8cc9bd22b8999b7de8aee9d47">gist</a> in Zoom chat. It is not his list, contrary to
my off-the-cuff guess</p>
 
 
<p>Why haven’t extensions taken off?</p>
 
 
<p>Lost Opportunities</p>
 
 No one canonical source to discover and install extensions 
 Difficult to find and discover extensions without canonical registry 
 Most extensions are under-documented and difficult to understand 
 They are also hard to configure and install; most people don’t want or
need a compiler 
 The maturity of extensions can be difficult to gauge, not systematized,
must each be independently researched
 
 David Christensen in Chat “attention economy/awareness, NIH, etc” 
 Jeremy S in chat: “Maybe some people don’t know they are using
extensions (I think that’s possible to some degree)” 
 
 
 There is no comprehensive binary packaging 
 Centralized source distribution is insufficient (even if it were complete)
 
 jubilee in chat: Trust aspect? 
 David Johnson in chat: To seem legit you need to touch the repo at
least annually to ensure it works on the newest major release.  Even
if you just do your compile and update the readme. 
 I mention using <a href="https://github.com/pgxn/docker-pgxn-tools">pgxn-utils</a> and GitHub workflows to ensure my
extensions continue working 
 
 
 There is insufficient developer tooling; pgxn-utils not well-maintained,
don’t build on recent Rubies, but <a href="https://github.com/pgcentralfoundation/pgrx">pgrx</a> has a lot of Rust-oriented
tooling

sets a better example to do curl &gt;file.sql … psql file.sql (encourage

<p>David Christensen in chat: “go has a pretty good extensions infra,
imho, wrt discovery/docs, etc. also has the benefit of the package names
being the URL to access it, which is a nice convention.”</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>New Opportunities Today</p>
<p>What are the community opportunities for the extension ecosystem?</p>
<p>Some ideas:</p>
 
 Improved dev tools: More than pgxn-utils and <a href="https://github.com/pgcentralfoundation/pgrx">pgrx</a> 
 Canonical registry: All publicly-available extensions in one pac3 
 Easy publishing: auto-discovery or CI/CD pipeline publishing 
 Continuous Delivery: CI/CD pipeline publishing 
 File-free installation: TLEs 
 Documentation: Something like Go docs or Rust docs 
 File management: Put all the files for an extension in one directory 
 Improved metadata
 
 Library Dependencies: utilities used by extensions 
 Platform Dependencies: system packages 
 Build pipelines: <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/extend-pgxs.html" title="PostgreSQL Extension Building Infrastructure">PGXS</a>, <a href="https://github.com/pgcentralfoundation/pgrx">pgrx</a>, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/">make</a>, <a href="https://www.cpan.org">cpan</a>, <a href="https://pypi.org">pypi</a>, etc. 
 Artifacts: Binaries build on release 
 Classification: Curated in addition to tags 
 Extension Types: Extensions, apps, background workers, loadable libraries 
 
 
 Derived Services
 
 Binary Packaging: Distributed binaries for many platforms 
 Ratings &amp; Reviews: Stars, thumbs, comments 
 Aggregated Stats: Repository stats, etc. 
 Smoke Testing: Matrix of multi-platform test results 
 Security Scanning: Reporting vulnerabilities 
 Badging &amp; Curation: Third-party classification, badging various statuses

 Discussion 
 
 
<p>Eric: I’m Eric Ridge, one of the developers behind pgrx, as you’re going
through this process of building a modern extension ecosystem, let us know
what we can do on the Rust side to help make your lives easier, we’re happy
to help any way we can.</p>
 
 
<p>Steven Miller in chat:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These are some areas of interest we noticed building Tembo</p>
<p>Binary packaging / distribution:</p>
 
 Variable installation location 
 System dependencies / uncommon system dependencies or versions 
 Chip specific instructions (e.g. vector compiled with avx512) 
 Extension-specific file types / extra data files (e.g. anonymizer .csv
data) 
 
<p>Turning on extensions automatically</p>
 
 Different ways to enable extensions 
 does it need load (shared_preload_libraries, session_… etc)? 
 Does it use create extension framework? 
 Does it require a specific schema? 
 What about turning on in multiple DBs at the same time in the same
cluster, with background worker? 
 Disabling, what data will be lost? 
 Validating safety / user feedback on upgrade? 
 
<p>In cloud / SaaS:</p>
 
 Installing + enabling extensions quickly, without restart 
 Persisting extension files 
 Extension-specific files (e.g. libraries) versus postgres’ libraries 
 Updating 
 Troubleshooting crashes / core dumps 
 
<p>Anyone else have similar problems / tips?</p>
</blockquote>
 
 
<p>Steven Miller: These were just things I noted during the presentation.
Curious if these are interesting to others on the call.</p>
 
 
<p>Daniele in chat: “Regards binary distributions, <a href="https://pythonwheels.com">python wheels</a> might be a
useful reference.”</p>
 
 
<p>Steven Miller: That’s good point! What do people think of idea to just
install extensions onto servers, not packages, persisted on the disk, next
to PGDATA so they go into a single persistent volume, and the rest is
managed by an immutable container.</p>
 
 
<p>Daniele: Had experience on Crunchy where we had to replace an image to get
an extension. Looked for feature to have a sidecar or a volume with the
extension.</p>
 
 
<p>Steven Miller: Didn’t have a separate directory just for extensions, it’s
just <code>pg_config --libdir</code> fore everything. Had to persist entire directory,
including those files form the base build, their internal files. Would have
been nice to have a separate directory, extra-libdr or extra-sharedir,
something like that.</p>
 
 
<p>Yurii Rashkovskii: I was working on a patch to do exactly that, but
haven’t completed it. Was going to introduce additional directories to
search for this stuff.</p>
 
 
<p>Steven Miller: That would be really awesome.</p>
 
 
<p>Jeremy S in chat: “Advantage of that is that a single image can be shared
among systems with different needs”</p>
 
 
<p>Eric in chat: “Thoughts around “enterprise repositories” that could be
self-hosted and disconnected from the internet?”</p>
 
 Ian Stanton in chat: “I’ll touch on this in the next talk, it’s
crossed our minds when building the Trunk registry” 
 
 
 
<p>Steven Miller: I think that’s a great idea.</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/iambagelkitty/">Bagel</a> reappears.</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler: <a href="https://pgxn.org/" title="The PostgreSQL Extension Network">PGXN</a> originally designed so anyone could run Manager and
their own root mirror, and maybe rsync from the community one. Don’t know
that anyone ever did, it’s a little complicated and most people don’t want
to work with Perl. [Chuckles]. Definitely think there’s space for that. If
you work with Java or Go or maybe Rust, lots of orgs like Artifactory that
provide internal registries. Could be cool use case for Postgres extensions.</p>
 
 
<p>David Christensen in chat: “something that could support extension
batches; like groups of related extensions that could be installed in bulk
or loaded in bulk (so could accommodate the shared systems with different
individual extension needs, but could be shared_preload_library configured)”</p>
 
 
<p>“Steven Miller” in chat: “Sounds familiar”</p>
 
 
<p>Greg Mullane (CrunchyData) [he/him] in chat: “All these items remind me of
CPAN. We should see what things it (and other similar systems) get right and
wrong. I’ve learned from CPAN that ratings, reviews, and badging are going
to be very difficult.”</p>
 
 David Christensen in chat: “I’d assumed at the time that it was
largely lifted (at least in philosophy/design) from CPAN. 🙂” 
 David Wheeler (he/him) in chat: “yes” 
 
 
 
<p>Jeremy S: I think this is mostly focused on developers, but I had recent
experience where multiple people in the past few months, new to Postgres,
are trying to understand extensions. They install a version and then see
there are like 15 versions installed, so confused. Goes back to the install
file. Bit of UX angle where there are sharp edges where people trying to
make sense of extensions, the flexibility makes it hard to understand. Some
might be some nice guides, some architectural things explaining PGXS, or
improvements to make to the design. Related, not main topic, but good to
keep end user UX and devs building on Postgres but not Postgres developers,
who run their businesses.</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler: Yeah all the files can be confusing, which is why I think
<a href="https://pgt.dev" title="Trunk — A Postgres Extension Registry">trunk</a> and <a href="https://pgxman.com/" title="npm for PostgreSQL">pgxman</a> trying to simplify: Just run this command and then you
have it.</p>
 
 
<p>Steven Miller in chat: “I really agree with what Jeremy is saying. Right
now PGXN and Trunk are taking and approach like “whatever an extension could
do / how it may work, it should work on this registry”. But I think more
standards / “what is a normal extension” would make the UX much easier.”</p>
 
 
<p>Jeremy S: Even with that the available extensions view is still there. Some
of that is just schema management, and that’s how core is doing schema
management.</p>
 
 
<p>Steven Miller in chat: I exactly agree about the concern about multiple
extensions within a package. Also version and name mismatches</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler: And not everything is an extension, you just want to work, or
your extension is just utility like pg_top you just want to use. Extensions
I think were a tremendous contribution to Postgres itself, but a lot of it
was wrangling the existing system for building Postgres itself to make it
work for that. Could be very interesting, though quite long term — and I
know Dimitri has tried this multiple times — to build a proper package
management system within Postgres itself, to eas a lot of that pain and
burden.</p>
 
 
<p>Tobias Bussmann in chat: “Thank you for the great overview and for taking
this topic further! Unfortunately, I’ll not be able to join at pgConf.dev
but will follow whatever results this will lead to. As a package maintainer,
I am constantly looking in a easy way to allow users to use extensions
without having to package everything ;)”</p>
 
 
<p>Steven Miller in chat: “Like auto explain for example right. i.e. a LOAD
only “extension””</p>
 
 
<p>*Yurii Rashkovskii: An interesting topic, what extensions are capable of
doing and how they can be more self-contained. Like Steven was saying in
chat: how easy is it to load and unload extensions. Example: want an
extension to hook into a part of Postgres: executor, planner, etc. How do
you go about enabling them? How you unload them, introspect, list of hooks.</p>
<p>Omni extension provides a list of all hooks, and when you remove an
extension it removes the hooks that provide the extension, but still not
part of the core. Hooks one of the greatest ways to expand the functionality
of Postgres, allows us to experiment with Postgres before committing to the
full cycle of getting a patch into Postgres. Lets us get it to users today
to try. if it makes a lot of sense and people want it, time to commit to the
process of getting a patch committed. But if we don’t hve this venue, how to
get extensions in, our ability to try things is limited.</p>
 
 
<p>jubilee in chat: Hmm. It seems my audio is not working.</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler: The next session is two weeks from today: Ian Stanton is
going to talk about “Building Trunk: A Postgres Extension Registry and CLI”.
Will be interesting because a number of people have decided to build a
binary packaging system for extensions, just to air out what the challenges
were, what problems they wanted to solve, what problems remain, and where
they want to take it in the future.</p>
 
 
<p>Jeremy S* in chat: “Bagel clearly has something to say”</p>
 
 
<p>*David Wheeler: jubileee I see your audio issues, do you just want to type
your question into chat? We can also discuss things in the <a href="https://postgresteam.slack.com/archives/C056ZA93H1A" title="Postgres Slack/#extensions: Extensions and extension-related accessories">#extensions</a>
channel on the <a href="https://pgtreats.info/slack-invite" title="Join the Postgres Slack">Postgres Slack</a></p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler: Thank you all for coming!</p>
 
 
<p>jubilee in chat: “I had a question which is about: Does Postgres actually
support docs for extensions? Like, a lot of people don’t really WANT to
read a README. Can you get docstrings for a function in psql?”</p>
 
 
<p>Ian Stanton in chat: “Thank you David!”</p>
 
 
<p>jubilee in chat: And if not, why not?</p>
 
 
 Post Presentation Discussion 
<p><a href="https://postgresteam.slack.com/archives/C056ZA93H1A/p1709762608926059">From Slack</a>:</p>
 
 David Wheeler: I see now that “jubilee” left their question in the Zoom chat. 
 David Wheeler: The closest attempt at this I’ve seen is <a href="https://pgxn.org/dist/pg_readme/0.6.6/README.html">pg_readme</a>, which
will generate Markdown for an extension from comments in the catalog and
write it out to a file. 
 David G. Johnson: The <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-comment.html">comment on</a> command adds in database comments that psql
describe commands should display. 
 
<p>Also <a href="https://postgresteam.slack.com/archives/C056ZA93H1A/p1709748156307179">on Slack</a>,
Greg Sabino Mullane started a longish thread on the things we want to do and build.</p>

 AGDPR doesn’t exist, but it&nbsp;should. <p>In 2012 the Europeans released the first proposal for their General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR), which ran a four-year political gauntlet and evolved into its final, official version in 2016. Because of the ghastly surveillance situation we now find ourselves in America and elsewhere, perpetrated by both private industry and government, I think America also desperately needs comprehensive privacy rules, rules informed by now eight years of hindsight and infused with an American value not found in Europe’s GDPR: privacy from government.</p><p>If I could wave a magic wand, an American GDPR would improve on Europe’s GDPR in two fundamental ways:</p> 1. Eliminate the idea that data about people can be “anonymized” or “de-identified”. <p>Data about people can no longer be effectively de-identified by removing personally identifying information (PII) from the dataset. Maybe this was generally still possible in 2016, but not any&nbsp;more.</p><p>GDPR set off a wave of innovation among data scientists who, like the old game “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBco7LLAcpc">Name That Tune</a>”, took the new regulation as a challenge and developed numerous ways to re-identify people using only a few data points that aren’t considered PII, techniques they’ve since made widely available. And that was before the recent explosion of AI tools which make re-identification easy without the direct use of such tools. Unfortunately, fully GDPR-compliant “de-identified” data sets are now trivially easy to re-identify for anyone with access to a computer.</p><p>(For more details on this topic, see <a href="https://privacytools.seas.harvard.edu/publications/towards-formalizing-gdpr%E2%80%99s-notion-singling-out">this Harvard paper</a> about “simple” attacks that defeat GDPR’s PSO Secure / “singling out” privacy protection provisions.)</p><p>If almost any data about a person is usable to re-identify them, then the whole concept PII is no longer relevant; any data about a person is PII. That is precisely how an AGDPR definition of “personal data” can improve upon the European one: any data about an person. It’s both simpler and more accurate.</p> 2. Include protections for privacy *from government*, in addition to privacy from the private&nbsp;sector. <p>Europe’s GDPR specifically exempts government, AGDPR should do the opposite: it should bind government’s activities in relation to obtaining, using and retaining personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>There are obviously necessary and important reasons for government to obtain, use, and retain personal data, and those reasons should be explicitly enumerated and protected. But the U.S. federal government has gone absolutely bananas when it comes to how much of our personal data they are obtaining about us and our activities, through legal but largely unchallenged means. The degree to which it’s happening is way beyond what’s reasonably needed in a free country that espouses limited government, and that has a Fourth Amendment that&nbsp;secures:</p><blockquote>“the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures”.</blockquote><p>How is data about us not our “effects”? How is government gathering our effects en masse without our explicit consent not “unreasonable”?</p><p>Journalist <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#">Byron Tau</a>’s new book about U.S. government surveillance of law-abiding citizens, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Means-Control-Alliance-Government-Surveillance/dp/B0C6YL6C81/">Means of Control</a>, is outrageous. (<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/02/28/government-buying-your-data-00143742">Summary article here.</a>) You cannot read it and not become deeply alarmed at the enormous, secret, ubiquitous surveillance state that already exists in the U.S. No doubt European governments are doing the same with their citizens’ data, but — and I’m generalizing here — they don’t have the same foundational distrust of government that the U.S. was born with and so may not be bothered enough to do anything about it, as evidenced by government’s total exemption from their GDPR. I hope, and believe, that once more Americans become aware of the extent of what’s happening, an American GDPR that clearly defines government’s role in privacy can become a real, politically viable possibility.</p><p>There is a model to follow. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-bramwell-26815515/">Christopher Bramwell</a>, the Chief Privacy Officer of Utah, was the driving force behind a groundbreaking new piece of <a href="https://le.utah.gov/~2024/bills/static/HB0491.html">privacy legislation</a> just enacted in Utah that constrains how personal data must be treated by government, without saying anything about private industry. As far as I know it’s the first of its kind, anywhere, and hopefully the first of many to follow in other states and countries. This bill gained a fortunate political boon as it advanced: it became a ‘vote against privacy’ to not support it; it passed unanimously.</p><p>Of course, privacy from big tech, surveillance capitalism, and private industry in general is a big deal, but private industry doesn’t have a monopoly on violence and taxes like government does; they mostly just want to sell me stuff. Still, the European GDPR shows an example of how to constrain private industry, and an American GDPR should learn from and incorporate those&nbsp;lessons.</p><p>The ideal outcome of an AGDPR would provide privacy both from private industry and from government, and finally put a halt to all federal activities of indiscriminate obtaining, using, and retaining of our personal digital “effects”, whether or not they’re considered PII.</p>

I think in this "scared new world," renewables change the dynamics of energy flows by moving production closer to energy use.</p><p>My wife, Lynne, recently gave me a copy of Peter Zeihan's book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00JJ322NC/windleyofente-20">The Accidental Superpower: Ten Years On</a>. The book was originally published in 2014, but Zeihan has updated it by inserting chapters talking about what he got right in 2014, what he got wrong, and why. The focus of the book is geopolitics—how geography and demographics shapes the world order—and how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_system">Bretton Woods</a> changed that in significant ways. The book makes the case that so much of what made Bretton Woods useful to the US and why the US engaged with the rest of the world for the 70 years following World War II is changing. As it changes the free trade system enabled by Bretton Woods is also changing. This will have significant impact on every country in the world.</p> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00JJ322NC/windleyofente-20">   </a> <p>Much of what changes has to do with energy. One of the things1 Zeihan got right was his assertion that unlike much of the rest of the developed world, the US doesn't need to import energy—specifically oil—we are a <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/vehicles/articles/fotw-1310-october-2-2023-united-states-has-been-positive-net-exporter#:~:text=Vehicle%20Technologies%20Office-,FOOTY%20%231310%2C%20October%202%2C%202023%3A%20The%20United%20States,of%20Primary%20Energy%20Since%202019&amp;text=Exports%20of%20primary%20energy%20have,to%2027.5%20quads%20in%202022.">net energy importer</a>. This changes the dynamic wherein the US is willing to be the protector of shipping lanes for the entire world. As a result, the future could see a US that has the luxury of ignoring events in the Middle East, Ukraine, and elsewhere, whereas Europe (to take just one example) cannot. The book is full of other interesting predictions and conclusions just like this one. I encourage you to read it if you find this as fascinating as I do.</p><p>Zeihan makes a big deal of shale oil production, which <a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=847&amp;t=6">accounted for 66% of US production in 2022</a>. But as I read this, I was thinking about renewables. As I wrote in 2020, <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/03/decarbonizing_locally.shtml">I've gone in big on solar power at my house, love my EV, and have replaced most things in the house (like the furnaces) with versions that run on electricity.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;I did this because it made my life easier and saves me money. The fact that it's good for the environment is a bonus.</p><p>But, solar and wind are not just renewable, they also allow energy production to be decentralized in ways oil and natural gas can't. Oil and natural gas deposits are where they are. Some countries are blessed with them and the others have to buy from those countries. And they're often far away, requiring shipping through <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/03/what-is-the-red-sea-crisis-and-what-does-it-mean-for-global-trade">potentially hostile waters</a>. But that's not true of renewables. They can usually be built and located where ever the need is2. This changes geopolitical equation in significant ways, but areas of the world that are not energy independent, like Europe, are <a href="https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/analysis/indicators/share-of-energy-consumption-from#:~:text=According%20to%20EEA%20early%20estimates,renewables%20has%20slowed%20since%202020.">moving toward renewables too slowly</a> to prevent future energy shocks. The problem with renewables is that they're long-lead items—they take years to plan and bring online.</p><p>Petroleum and Bretton Woods enabled the modern world, providing portable, storable sources of energy that could easily and safely move to where ever it was needed.3 If we are indeed at the end of the Bretton Woods era, the world is in for significant changes as it adjusts to a life where free trade, and easy access to petroleum-based energy, cannot be assumed. Moving energy production closer to the places it's used is one strategy for dealing with this world-altering disruption. Buckle up.</p>    Notes   <p>There are other things that are important to the books overall conclusion besides energy. I'm just cherry picking that because I was thinking about it. For example, the US is largely self-sufficient from an overall import/export standpoint. We don't import nearly as much as many other countries and could replace what we do import relatively easily.</p>  <p>It's not just renewables. Nuclear power can also be located closer to demand than an oil deposit. I started my career as a nuclear metallurgist, so I'm a fan.

<p>Update: 2024-03-06: Slides and video linked below.</p>
<p>A quick reminder that I’ll be giving a brief talk on the “State of the Extension
Ecosystem” on Wednesday at noon US Eastern / 17:00 UTC. This talk is the first
in a series of <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/851125899477/" title="Postgres Extension Ecosystem Mini-Summit">community talks and discussions</a> on the postgres
extension ecosystem leading up to the <a href="https://www.pgevents.ca/events/pgconfdev2024/schedule/session/191">Extension Ecosystem Summit</a>
at pgconf.dev on May 28.</p>
<p>I plan to give a brief history of Postgres extension tools and distribution,
the challenges encountered, recent developments, and opportunities for the
future. It should take about 30 minutes, followed by discussion. Following
this pattern for all the talks in <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/851125899477/" title="Postgres Extension Ecosystem Mini-Summit">the series</a>,  I hope to set up
some engaging discussions and to surface significant topics ahead of <a href="https://www.pgevents.ca/events/pgconfdev2024/schedule/session/191">the
summit</a>.</p>

<p>This article shows how to onboard different clients or organizations in an ASP.NET Core application to use separated Azure blob containers with controlled access using security groups and RBAC applied roles. Each user in a client group can only access a single blob storage and has no access to blob containers belonging to different clients. Microsoft Entra ID is used to implement the blob storage access.</p>

 Multi client blob storage access using ASP.NET Core with Entra ID authentication and RBAC 
 



<p></p>



 Security context diagram 



<p>The web application uses different Enterprise applications to access the different Azure APIs. One Enterprise application is used to implement the blob application contributor access which can only be used from the application. This is used when a user in the application needs to write a file to the blob through the application. A second Enterprise application is used to create the RBAC access for the blob container reader access to the files. This is used when creating a new client or new organization. A third Enterprise application is used to implement the web application OpenID Connect web client. This is created using an Azure app registration and only allows delegated permissions. The user App roles are defined in this application. The Microsoft Graph APIs can be implemented using delegated permissions or application permissions. If using Graph application permissions to create or remove the groups, a separate Enterprise application is used to create the groups. You can also used the app service managed identity and use the service principal instead of the 3 enterprise applications to assign the required permissions.</p>







<p></p>



<p></p>



 Multi client blob storage setup 



<p>The Blob account uses Microsoft Entra ID to access the blob containers. The application can write to all containers and a security group is given RBAC blob container reader access, one per security group. Users are added to the security groups per client or per organization. The setup for the client blob container is implemented in three steps:</p>



 
 Create a Microsoft Entra ID security group 



 Create an Azure storage blob container 



 Create an RBAC to give the security group Blob storage reader permissions 
 



<p></p>



 Create a Microsoft Entra ID security group 



<p>The CreateSecurityGroupAsync method creates a new security group in Microsoft Entra ID. This is created using Microsoft Graph and returns the group with the group ID. The service uses application permissions and is implemented in a separate Enterprise application.</p>


  using System.Text;
using Microsoft.Graph.Models;

namespace MultiClientBlobStorage.Providers.GroupUserServices;

public class ApplicationMsGraphService
{
    private readonly GraphApplicationClientService _graphApplicationClientService;

    public ApplicationMsGraphService(
       GraphApplicationClientService graphApplicationClientService)
    {
        _graphApplicationClientService = graphApplicationClientService;
    }

    public async Task&lt;Group?&gt; CreateSecurityGroupAsync(string group)
    {
        var graphServiceClient = _graphApplicationClientService
            .GetGraphClientWithClientSecretCredential();

        var formatted = RemoveSpecialCharacters(group);
        var groupName = $"blob-{formatted.Trim()}-{Guid.NewGuid()}".ToLower();

        var requestBody = new Group
        {
            DisplayName = groupName,
            Description = $"Security group for all users from {groupName}",
            MailEnabled = false,
            MailNickname = formatted,
            SecurityEnabled = true
        };

        var result = await graphServiceClient.Groups.PostAsync(requestBody);
        return result;
    }

    private string RemoveSpecialCharacters(string str)
    {
        var sb = new StringBuilder();
        foreach (var c in str)
        {
            if (c is &gt;= '0' and &lt;= '9' || c is &gt;= 'A' and &lt;= 'Z' 
                  || c is &gt;= 'a' and &lt;= 'z' || c == '.' || c == '_')
            {
                sb.Append(c);
            }
        }

        return sb.ToString();
    }
}
  


<p></p>



 Create an Azure storage blob container 



<p>The CreateContainer method creates a new Azure blob container using the BlobServiceClient from the Azure.Storage.Blobs nuget package.</p>


  private async Task&lt;BlobContainerClient&gt; CreateContainer(string name)
{
    try
    {
        var formatted = RemoveSpecialCharacters(name);
        string containerName = $"blob-{formatted.Trim()}-{Guid.NewGuid()}"
           .ToLower();

        var storage = _configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("AzureStorage:Storage");

        var credential = _clientSecretCredentialProvider
           .GetClientSecretCredential();

        if (storage != null &amp;&amp; credential != null)
        {
            var blobServiceClient = 
            new BlobServiceClient(new Uri(storage), credential);

            var metadata = new Dictionary&lt;string, string?&gt;
            {
                { "name", name },
            };

            // Create the root container
            var blobContainerClient = await blobServiceClient
            .CreateBlobContainerAsync(
                containerName,
                PublicAccessType.None,
                metadata);

            if (blobContainerClient.Value.Exists())
            {
                Console.WriteLine(
                   $"Created container: {name} {blobContainerClient.Value.Name}");
            }

            return blobContainerClient.Value;
        }

        throw new Exception($"Could not create container: {name}");
    }
    catch (RequestFailedException e)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("HTTP error code {0}: {1}", e.Status, e.ErrorCode);
        Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
        throw;
    }
}
  


<p></p>



 Create an RBAC to give the security group Blob storage reader permissions 



<p>The ApplyReaderGroupToBlobContainer method creates an RBAC for the security group on the blob container itself. The group and the container were created in the previous steps and this takes an unknown length of time. Polly is used to repeat until the group and the container are ready and it creates the assignment.</p>


  public async Task ApplyReaderGroupToBlobContainer(
     BlobContainerClient blobContainer, string groupId)
{
    var maxRetryAttempts = 20;
    var pauseBetweenFailures = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(3);

    var retryPolicy = Policy
        .Handle&lt;Exception&gt;()
        .WaitAndRetryAsync(maxRetryAttempts, i =&gt; pauseBetweenFailures);

    await retryPolicy.ExecuteAsync(async () =&gt;
    {
        // RBAC security group Blob data read
        await _azureMgmtClientService
            .StorageBlobDataReaderRoleAssignment(groupId,
                blobContainer.AccountName,
                blobContainer.Name);

        // NOTE service principal blob write is configured on root 
    });
}
  


<p></p>



<p>Azure management REST API is used to create the RBAC. This rest API is implemented using a HttpClient and uses an Enterprise application to define the required permissions. This requires an administration Azure role and with this, you have full control of the Azure tenant.</p>


  using System.Net.Http.Headers;

 Notes 



<p>This works well but requires that the application has high privileged access permissions. Most IT departments will not allow this and the creation of blob containers would have to use the IT preferred tools. This type of automation requires 2 different Azure APIs and is not well documented.</p>

  Thinking through the PostgreSQL extension metadata use cases and
recognizing the types of information they need.

<div class='item-content item-summary'>

<!-- todo: use sanitize or simplify or whitelist

<p>Lately I’ve been thinking a lot about metadata for Postgres extensions.
Traditional use cases include <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/extend-extensions.html#EXTEND-EXTENSIONS-FILES" title="PostgreSQL Docs: Extension Files">control file metadata</a>, which lives in
<code>.control</code> files used by <code>CREATE EXTENSION</code> and friends, and <a href="https://pgxn.org/spec/" title="PGXN Meta Spec - The PGXN distribution metadata specification">PGXN metadata</a>,
which lives in <code>META.json</code> files used by <a href="https://pgxn.org" title="The postgreSQL Extension Network">PGXN</a> to index and publish extensions.
But these two narrow use cases for SQL behavior and source code distribution
don’t provide the information necessary to enable other use cases, including
building, installing, configuration, and more.</p>
<p>So I have also been exploring other metadata formats, including:</p>
 
 <a href="https://go.dev/doc/modules/gomod-ref" title="go.mod file reference">Go <code>go.mod</code></a> 
 <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html" title="The Cargo Book: The Manifest Format">Cargo Manifest File</a> 
 <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/configuring-npm/package-json" title="npm Docs: Specifics of npm's package.json handling">npm <code>package.json</code></a> 
 <a href="https://github.com/tembo-io/trunk/tree/main/contrib"><code>trunk.toml</code></a> 
 <a href="https://docs.pgxman.com/spec/buildkit">pgxman buildkit</a> 
 
<p>These standards from neighboring communities reveal a great deal of overlap, as
one might expect (everything has a name, a version, an author, license, and so
on), but also types of metadata that had not occurred to me. As I took notes and
gathered suggestions from colleagues and coworkers, I began to recognize natural
groupings of metadata. This lead to the realization that it might be easier —
and more productive — to think about these groupings rather than individual
fields.</p>
<p>I therefore propose a typology for Postgres extension metadata.</p>
 Extension Metadata Typology 
 Essentials 
<p>Essential information about the extension itself, including its name (or unique
package name), version, list of authors, license, etc. Pretty much every
metadata format encompasses this data. Ecosystem applications use it for
indexing, installation locations, naming conventions, and display information.</p>
 Artifacts 
<p>A list of links and checksums for downloading the extension in one or more
formats, including source code, binaries, system packages, and more. Apps use
this information to determine the best option for installing an extension on a
particular system.</p>
 Resources 
<p>External information about the extension, mostly links, including source code
repository, bug reporting, documentation, badges, funding, etc. Apps use this
data for links, of course, but also full text indexing, documentation rendering,
and displaying useful information about the extension.</p>
 Contents 
<p>A description of what’s included in the extension package. Often an “extension”
consists of multiple extensions, such as <a href="http://postgis.net/">PostGIS</a>, which includes <code>postgis</code>,
<code>postgis_tiger_geocoder</code>, <code>address_standardizer</code>, and more. Furthermore, some
extensions are not <code>CREATE EXTENSION</code>-type extension at all, such as <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/bgworker.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: Background Worker Processes">background
workers</a>, command-line apps, libraries, etc. Each should be listed along with
documentation links where they differ from the package overall (or are simply
more specific).</p>
 Prerequisites 
<p>A list of external dependencies required to configure, build, test, install, and
run the extension. These include not only other extensions, but also external
libraries and OS-specific lists of binary package dependencies. And let’s not
forget the versions of Postgres required, as well as any OS and version
dependencies (e.g, does it work on Windows? FreeBSD? What versions?) and
architectures (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AArch64" title="Wikipedia: AArch64">arm64</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amd64" title="Wikipedia: AMD64">amd64</a>, etc.)</p>
 How to Build It 
<p>Metadata that apps use to determine how to build the extension. Does it use the
PostgreSQL <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/extend-pgxs.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: Extension Building Infrastructure">PGXS</a> build pipeline? Or perhaps it needs the <a href="https://github.com/pgcentralfoundation/pgrx/blob/develop/cargo-pgrx/README.md" title="pgrx: cargo-pgrx">cargo</a>-based <a href="https://github.com/pgcentralfoundation/pgrx" title="pgrx: Build Postgres Extensions with Rust!">pgrx</a>
toolchain. Maybe a traditional <code>./configure &amp;&amp; make</code> pattern? Perl, Ruby,
Python, Go, Rust, or NPM tooling? Whatever the pattern, this metadata needs to
be sufficient for an ecosystem app to programmatically determine how to build
an extension.</p>
 How to Install It 
<p>Usually an extension of the build metadata, the install metadata describes how
to install the extension. That could be <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/extend-pgxs.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: Extension Building Infrastructure">PGXS</a> or <a href="https://github.com/pgcentralfoundation/pgrx" title="pgrx: Build Postgres Extensions with Rust!">pgrx</a> again, but could also
use other patterns — or multiple patterns! For example, perhaps an extension
can be built and installed with <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/extend-pgxs.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: Extension Building Infrastructure">PGXS</a>, but it might also be <a href="https://github.com/aws/pg_tle" title="pg_tle: Framework for building trusted language extensions for PostgreSQL">TLE</a>-safe, and
therefore provide details for handing the SQL files off to a <a href="https://github.com/aws/pg_tle/blob/main/examples/README.md" title="TLE examples/pgtle.mk README">TLE installer</a>.</p>
<p>This typology might include additional data, such as documentation files to
install (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page" title="Wikipedia: Man page">man pages</a> anyone?), or directories of dependent files or libraries,
and the like — whatever needs to be installed for the extension.</p>
 How to Run It 
<p>Not all Postgres extensions are <code>CREATE EXTENSION</code> extensions. Some provide
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/bgworker.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: Background Worker Processes">background workers</a> to perform various tasks; others simply provide Utility
applications like <a href="https://pg_top.gitlab.io" title="Welcome to the PostgreSQL top Project Home Page">pg_top</a> and <a href="https://reorg.github.io/pg_repack/" title="pg_repack --- Reorganize tables in PostgreSQL databases with minimal locks">pg_repack</a>. In fact <a href="https://reorg.github.io/pg_repack/" title="pg_repack --- Reorganize tables in PostgreSQL databases with minimal locks">pg_repack</a> provides both
a command-line application and a <code>CREATE EXTENSION</code> extension in one package!</p>
<p>This metadata also provides configuration information, both <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/extend-extensions.html#EXTEND-EXTENSIONS-FILES" title="PostgreSQL Docs: Extension Files">control file
parameters</a> like <code>trusted</code>, <code>superuser</code>, and <code>schema</code>, but also load
configuration information, like whether an extension needs its libraries
included in <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-client.html#GUC-SHARED-PRELOAD-LIBRARIES" title="PostgreSQL Docs: shared_preload_libraries"><code>shared_preload_libraries</code></a> to enable <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-load.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: LOAD"><code>LOAD</code></a> or requires a
cluster restart. (Arguably this information should be in the “install” typology
rather than “run”.)</p>
 Classification 
<p>Classification metadata lets the extension developer associate additional
information to improve discovery, such as key words. It might also allow
selections from a curated list of extension classifications, such as the
<a href="https://crates.io/category_slugs" title="crates.io: All Valid Category Slugs">category slugs</a> supported for the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-categories-field" title="The Cargo Book: The Manifest Format --- Categories">cargo categories field</a>. Ecosystem apps use
this data to organize extensions under key words or categories, making it easier
for users to find extensions often used together or for various workloads or
tasks.</p>
 Metrics and Reports 
<p>This final typology differs from the others in that its metadata derives from
third party sources rather than the extension developer. It includes data such
as number of downloads, build and test status on various Postgres/OS/version
combinations, binary packaging distributions, test coverage, security scan
results, vulnerability detection, quality metrics and user ratings, and more.</p>
<p>In the broader ecosystem, it would be the responsibility of the root registry to
ensure such data in the canonical data for each extension comes only from
trusted sources, although applications downstream of the root registry might
extend metrics and reports metadata with their own information.</p>
 What More? 
<p>Reading through various metadata standards, I suspect this typology is fairly
comprehensive, but I’m usually mistaken about such things. What other types of
metadata do you find essential for the use cases you’re familiar with? Do they
fit one of the types here, or do they require some other typology I’ve failed to
imagine? Hit the <a href="https://postgresteam.slack.com/archives/C056ZA93H1A" title="Postgres Slack/#extensions: Extensions and extension-related accessories">#extensions</a> channel on the <a href="https://pgtreats.info/slack-invite" title="Join the Postgres Slack">Postgres Slack</a> to contribute to
the discussion, or give me a holler <a href="https://xoxo.zone/@theory" title="@theory@xoxo.zone">on Mastodon</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I’ll be refining this typology and assigning all the metadata fields
to them in the coming weeks, with an eye to proposing a community-wide metadata
standard. I hope it will benefit us all; your input will ensure it does.</p>

<p>This article shows how an ASP.NET Core application can control the write access to an Azure blob storage container using an application app registration. Microsoft Entra ID is used to control the user access and to implement the authentication of the web application.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCoreEntraIdBlobStorage">https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCoreEntraIdBlobStorage</a></p>



 Blogs in this series 



 
 <a href="https://damienbod.com/2024/02/12/using-blob-storage-from-asp-net-core-with-entra-id-authentication/">Using Blob storage from ASP.NET Core with Entra ID authentication</a> 



 Delegated read and application write access to blob storage using ASP.NET Core with Entra ID authentication 



 <a href="https://damienbod.com/2024/03/04/multi-client-blob-storage-access-using-asp-net-core-with-entra-id-authentication-and-rbac/">Multi client blob storage access using ASP.NET Core with Entra ID authentication and RBAC</a> 
 



<p>The solution provides a secure upload and secure download using Microsoft Entra ID. Users are authenticated using Microsoft Entra ID. The blob storage containers use Microsoft Entra ID security groups to control the read access. The upload access uses the an Enterprise application for the contributor role. This is used from the ASP.NET Core application for file upload.</p>



<p>In Azure, only the application can upload files and the users of the groups can only read the files.</p>







<p></p>



<p>The RBAC are setup as shown:</p>







<p></p>



 Blob storage application write access 



<p>The application can upload files to Azure blob storage. Client secrets are used to acquire the access token using the client credentials OAuth flow. This can be further improved by using a certificate and using the client assertions or even a managed identity from the host service. For development, I normally use a secret for simplicity.</p>


  using Azure.Identity;

namespace DelegatedReadAppWriteBlobStorage.FilesProvider.AzureStorageAccess;

public class ClientSecretCredentialProvider
{
    private readonly IConfiguration _configuration;

    public ClientSecretCredentialProvider(IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        _configuration = configuration;
    }

    public ClientSecretCredential GetClientSecretCredential()
    {
        // Values from app registration
        var tenantId = _configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("AzureAd:TenantId");
        var clientId = _configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("ApplicationClient:ClientId");
        var clientSecret = _configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("ApplicationClient:ClientSecret");

        var options = new ClientSecretCredentialOptions
        {
            AuthorityHost = AzureAuthorityHosts.AzurePublicCloud
        };

        // https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.identity.clientsecretcredential
        var clientSecretCredential = new ClientSecretCredential(
            tenantId, clientId, clientSecret, options);

        return clientSecretCredential;
    }
}
  


<p></p>



<p>The BlobApplicationUploadProvider uses the token and makes it possible to upload files to the Azure Blob storage. The provider uses the IFormFile as a parameter for the file data. Meta data is persisted in the local SQL database.</p>


  using Azure.Storage.Blobs;
using Azure.Storage.Blobs.Models;

namespace DelegatedReadAppWriteBlobStorage.FilesProvider.AzureStorageAccess;

public class BlobApplicationUploadProvider
{
    private readonly IConfiguration _configuration;
    private readonly ClientSecretCredentialProvider _clientSecretCredentialProvider;

    public BlobApplicationUploadProvider(ClientSecretCredentialProvider clientSecretCredentialProvider,
        IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        _configuration = configuration;
        _clientSecretCredentialProvider = clientSecretCredentialProvider;
    }

    public async Task&lt;string&gt; AddNewFile(BlobFileUploadModel blobFileUpload, IFormFile file)
    {
        try
        {
            return await PersistFileToAzureStorage(blobFileUpload, file);
        }
        catch (Exception e)
        {
            throw new ApplicationException($"Exception {e}");
        }
    }

    private async Task&lt;string&gt; PersistFileToAzureStorage(
        BlobFileUploadModel blobFileUpload,
        IFormFile formFile,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
    {
        var storage = _configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("AzureStorage:StorageAndContainerName");
        var fileFullName = $"{storage}/{blobFileUpload.Name}";
        var blobUri = new Uri(fileFullName);

        var blobUploadOptions = new BlobUploadOptions
        {
            Metadata = new Dictionary&lt;string, string?&gt;
            {
                { "uploadedBy", blobFileUpload.UploadedBy },
                { "description", blobFileUpload.Description }
            }
        };

        var blobClient = new BlobClient(blobUri, _clientSecretCredentialProvider.GetClientSecretCredential());

        var inputStream = formFile.OpenReadStream();
        await blobClient.UploadAsync(inputStream, blobUploadOptions, cancellationToken);

        return $"{blobFileUpload.Name} successfully saved to Azure Blob Storage Container";
    }
}
  


<p></p>



 Blob storage delegated read access 



<p>The blob storage reader access is given to all users in the security group. This security group uses the app-role from the Azure app registration and the group can access the blob container, not the blob account. No SAS are used .</p>


  using Azure.Core;
using Microsoft.Identity.Client;
using Microsoft.Identity.Web;

namespace DelegatedReadAppWriteBlobStorage.FilesProvider.AzureStorageAccess;

public class DelegatedTokenAcquisitionTokenCredential : TokenCredential
{
    private readonly ITokenAcquisition _tokenAcquisition;
    private readonly IConfiguration _configuration;

    public DelegatedTokenAcquisitionTokenCredential(ITokenAcquisition tokenAcquisition,
        IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        _tokenAcquisition = tokenAcquisition;
        _configuration = configuration;
    }

    public override AccessToken GetToken(TokenRequestContext requestContext, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        throw new NotImplementedException();
    }

    public override async ValueTask&lt;AccessToken&gt; GetTokenAsync(TokenRequestContext requestContext, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        string[]? scopes = _configuration["AzureStorage:ScopeForAccessToken"]?.Split(' ');

        if (scopes == null)
        {
            throw new Exception("AzureStorage:ScopeForAccessToken configuration missing");
        }

        AuthenticationResult result = await _tokenAcquisition
            .GetAuthenticationResultForUserAsync(scopes);

        return new AccessToken(result.AccessToken, result.ExpiresOn);
    }
}
  


 Notes 



<p>Using an application for write access to the blob storage has both advantages and disadvantages in context of security. Removing the write access to all users is positive, but when using applications or if the application has weak security, this approach can be bad. Using a managed identity for the deployed service would improve the security and would remove the need for secrets or certificates to authenticate the application. This prepares the access for the next solution which would be to implement a multi-tenant or multi-client application using the Azure blob.</p>

 Today I was fortunate to have my picture taken with Morris Lukowich during Hockey Day in Houston at Saint Arnold Brewing.  The best hockey games I have ever watched in-person were the 1977-78 Houston Aeros.  The WHA All-Star game was in Quebec City on January 17, 1978 and for the picture I believe it is Lukowich’s All-Star jersey from that game that I have borrowed.

 Fixed #2112, #2113, and #2114: Defined that client authentication is not used by default and that the default client authentication method, when used, is private_key_jwt. Specified that requests using client authentication use HTTP POST. 
 Fixed #2104: Allow trust marks in Subordinate Statements for implementation profiles that might want this. 
 Fixed #2103: Addressed ambiguities in the definition of constraints. 
 
<p>-32:</p>
 
 Tightened OpenID Connect Client Registration section. 
 Tightened appendix examples. 
 Fixed #2075: Trust Mark endpoint for the provisioning of the Trust Marks. 
 Fixed #2085: Trust Marked Entities Listing, added sub URL query parameter. 
 Made fetch issuer unambiguous by making the iss parameter REQUIRED. 
 Introduced the term “Subordinate Statement” and applied it throughout the specification. Also consistently use the term “registration Entity Statement” for Explicit Client Registration results. 
 Clarified where Entity Statement claims can and cannot occur. 
 Renamed policy_language_crit to metadata_policy_crit. 
 Fixed #2093: Numbered the list defining the order policy operators are applied in.

<p>The <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9396.html">Rich Authorization Request extension to OAuth 2</a>, or RAR, is a way to talk about access in the OAuth space beyond what scopes allow, and it is defined in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9396.html">RFC9396</a>. One of the key motivations behind RAR was admitting, as a community, that a lot of times you need more than a set of scope values to properly describe access to an&nbsp;API.</p> A Larger&nbsp;Scope <p>Scopes work pretty well in OAuth, but they’re ultimately just a set of strings. It’s worlds better than the all-or-nothing access that OAuth 1 or API keys give you, and if you have an API, they allow you to easily separate read and write access. But what if you want to be more specific? What if you want to, say, let someone access a specific account for certain features for a certain amount of time? Or read in one place but write to another? And what if you want to compose that set of features differently, such as any account for an unlimited time but only if the user’s online? The ways of describing API access are as varied as the APIs being accessed.</p><p>When faced with this problem, the first thing that many people realize is that because scopes are just strings, their own API can impose semantics and syntax on those strings. So people <a href="https://blue-button.github.io/blue-button-plus-pull/#scopes">add parameters</a>, or define <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-heart-fhir-oauth2-1_0.html#rfc.section.2">composition rules</a>, or even define a <a href="https://utilityapi.com/docs/greenbutton/scope">whole query language</a> embedded into the scope string. But those approaches require a lot of complex processing and lack interoperable structure that would let you easily combine protection of multiple kinds of&nbsp;APIs.</p><p>What RAR gives you, instead, is an array of JSON objects to describe your API access. So instead of trying to cram everything into a single string, you can now put together an object that defines exactly what you&nbsp;want.</p> [<br>   {<br>      "type": "payment_initiation",<br>      "actions": [<br>         "initiate",<br>         "status",<br>         "cancel"<br>      ],<br>      "locations": [<br>         "https://example.com/payments"<br>      ],<br>      "instructedAmount": {<br>         "currency": "EUR",<br>         "amount": "123.50"<br>      },<br>      "creditorName": "Merchant A",<br>      "creditorAccount": {<br>         "iban": "DE02100100109307118603"<br>      },<br>      "remittanceInformationUnstructured": "Ref Number Merchant"<br>   }<br>] <p>This object is specific to the API in question and carries with it all the detail that is needed for successful processing. Each kind of API can define its own type value, which in turn defines what’s allowed to go into the rest of the object. And if you need more than one view of things, like read access to A but write access to B, then you can pass in multiple objects in the same structure.</p><p>One important question arises out of this: who needs to know this level of&nbsp;detail?</p> Who Cares About&nbsp;RAR <p>In this regard, RAR really is built on top of the concept of a scope. In an OAuth delegation, there are four parties. The client, resource owner, authorization server (AS), and resource server&nbsp;(RS).</p>The four parties in OAuth delegation, illustration from OAuth 2 In&nbsp;Action<p>These parties have particular relationships, and each of them might care about a RAR object or a scope in a slightly different way. However, the more important question is about which relationship is in&nbsp;play.</p> Client -&gt; AS: Requesting Access <p>When requesting an access token, the client needs to be able to describe to the AS what it wants. RAR allows the client to get VERY specific, if the client knows what details it wants ahead of time. Maybe the client has prompted the resource owner for an account identifier, or has learned through some other protocol where the target system is located, or it’s just been configured to know that it needs to ask for specific objects in order to do specific things. In all of these cases, the client can send RAR objects to the AS just like it would a scope, in the hopes of getting an access token that can do what it asks&nbsp;for.</p> AS -&gt; Client: Granting&nbsp;Access <p>When the access token is granted, the AS can tell the client which RAR objects have been applied to the token. While this information is no substitute for an API discovery protocol, this approach can let the client differentiate what an access token is good for in different dimensions. For example, a client can ask for a token for an available signing service, and then be granted a token for use at a specific signing service, indicated through the locations field in the RAR&nbsp;object.</p> AS -&gt; Resource owner: Gathering Authorization <p>During the delegation process, the AS often needs to prompt the resource owner to see if they’re OK with what’s being delegated. While this starts as the Client-&gt;AS request, RAR gives the AS an opportunity to fine-tune the access by asking the resource owner to be specific, or even filling in values that get put into the resulting RAR object. Maybe the client is asking for account access but the resource owner stipulates that it’s only good for the next five minutes. This does come at a usability cost, since it’s much easier to display a list of scope strings with checkboxes. But experience has shown that this list is not a great security measure anyway, since most users won’t change the checkboxes, and often don’t understand the differentiated access being&nbsp;granted.</p> AS -&gt; RS: Describing Access <p>The access token itself represents a certain set of rights that have been granted. These can be described in the metadata of the token, available through either a structured token field or an introspection response. In this way, the RS can learn what an access token is good for, and apply its policies appropriately. Does the token grant access for the HTTP GET command on the resource at /photo/123-fda1d? Is this token even good at this specific RS, or is it meant for somewhere else? The RAR object can be used to describe all of&nbsp;this.</p> Not Everything Has To&nbsp;Match <p>Finally, it’s important to note that the all of these different branches need not match each other in a single transaction. In one of the applications where I’ve personally deployed RAR, the client never sees the RAR objects. The client knows to ask for a specific scope, and the AS knows that when it sees that scope, the resulting token needs to apply to a whole set of things represented by the current user’s access within the system. The downstream APIs know nothing about users or accounts, but they do know the resources they&nbsp;protect.</p><p>As a consequence, the AS translates the client’s incoming scope request to a set of RAR objects that the APIs understand. The APIs never see or care about the scope, and the client never sees or cares about the RAR. In this way, internal API details stay internal and do not leak unnecessarily into the wider&nbsp;system.</p><p>However, a different client in this same ecosystem does have insight into the details of the API structure, and therefore its requests do specify RAR objects that target the APIs. These objects are processed in exactly the same way by the API servers, which gives us a powerful parallelism and profound code reuse in production.</p> GNAP Native <p>In <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-gnap-core-protocol-18.html">GNAP</a>, one of our main goals was to see what an OAuth-style system would look like without the constraints and history of OAuth, and one such constraint includes scopes. Consequently, GNAP’s native access rights is an array of objects that look suspiciously like RAR objects. This design is, of course, intentional, and in many ways RAR is the backport of GNAP’s access rights system to work on top of OAuth 2. While GNAP doesn’t have scopes in the same way, GNAP’s reference-based approach to its API design does allow for the use of a simple string to stand in for the objects in question, allowing a request to have both shortcut and fully specified items in the same&nbsp;request.</p> "access": [<br>    {<br>        "type": "photo-api",<br>        "actions": [<br>            "read",<br>            "write"<br>        ],<br>        "locations": [<br>            "https://server.example.net/",<br>            "https://resource.local/other"<br>        ],<br>        "datatypes": [<br>            "metadata",<br>            "images"<br>        ],<br>        "geolocation": [<br>            { lat: -32.364, lng: 153.207 },<br>            { lat: -35.364, lng: 158.207 }<br>        ]<br>    },<br>    {<br>        "type": "financial-transaction",<br>        "actions": [<br>            "withdraw"<br>        ],<br>        "identifier": "account-14-32-32-3",<br>        "currency": "USD"<br>    },<br>    "dolphin-metadata",<br>    "some other thing"<br>]  How Can I Use&nbsp;RAR? <p>RAR support is starting to show up across different vendors, though it’s not universal yet. One of the companies I work for, <a href="https://www.authlete.com/">Authlete</a>, supports RAR natively. Other products can often have RAR grafted on top, since it takes the form of an extra parameter to be processed by an extension or&nbsp;module.</p><p>The real value is that we are starting to see API access defined in terms of RAR objects, replacing the awkward and error-prone string composition practices of the past. RAR may seem complex, but when you look at how APIs are defined and scopes are used, the power of that complexity really starts to show its&nbsp;value.</p>

<p>Every software distribution system deals with versioning. Early in the design of
<a href="https://pgxn.org" title="The postgreSQL Extension Network">PGXN</a>, I decided to require <a href="https://semver.org" title="Semantic Versioning">semantic versions</a> (SemVer), a
clearly-defined and widely-adopted version standard, even in its <a href="https://semver.org/spec/v1.0.0-beta.html" title="Semantic Versioning 1.0.0-beta">pre-1.0
specification</a>. I implemented the <a href="https://pgxn.org/dist/semver" title="semver: A semantic version data type / PostgreSQL Extension Network">semver data type</a> that would properly sort
semantic versions, later ported to C by <a href="http://vilain.net" title="Sam Vilain: Free Software Programmer - Wood Craftsman - Open Water Swimmer - Science Enthusiast">Sam Vilain</a> and eventually updated to
<a href="https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html" title="Semantic Versioning 2.0.0">semver 2.0.0</a>.</p>
<p>As I’ve been thinking through the <a href="https://tembo.io/blog/pgxn-ecosystem-jobs" title="The Jobs to be Done by the Ideal Postgres Extension Ecosystem">jobs</a> and <a href="https://gist.github.com/theory/898c8802937ad8361ccbcc313054c29d#tools" title="Extension Ecosystem: Jobs and Tools">tools</a> for the Postgres extension
ecosystem, I wanted to revisit this decision, the context in which it was made,
and survey the field for other options. Maybe a “PGXN v2” should do something
different?</p>
<p>But first that context, starting with Postgres itself.</p>
 PostgreSQL Extension Version Standard 
<p>From the introduction extensions in PostgreSQL 9.1, the project side-stepped the
need for version standardization and enforcement by requiring extension authors
to adopt a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/extend-extensions.html#EXTEND-EXTENSIONS-UPDATES" title="PostgreSQL Docs: “Packaging Related Objects into an Extension —&nbsp;Extension Updates”">file naming convention</a>, instead. For example, an extension named
“pair” must have a file with its name, two dashes, then the version as listed in
its control file, like so:</p>
 <code>pair--1.1.sql
</code> <p>As long as the file name is correct and the version part byte-compatible with
the control file entry, <code>CREATE EXTENSION</code> will find it. To upgrade an extension
the author must provide a second file with the extension name, the old version,
and the new version, all delimited by double dashes. For example, to upgrade our
“pair” extension to version <code>1.2</code>, the author supply all the SQL commands
necessary to upgrade it in this file:</p>
 <code>pair--1.1--1.2.sql
</code> <p>This pattern avoids the whole question of version standards, ordering for
upgrades or downgrades, and all the rest: extension authors have full
responsibility to name their files correctly.</p>
 PGXN Versions 
<p><a href="https://semver.org" title="Semantic Versioning">SemVer</a> simplified a number of issues for PGXN in ways that the PostgreSQL
extension versioning did not (without having to re-implement the core’s file
naming code). PGXN wants all metadata for an extension in its <a href="https://pgxn.org/spec/" title="PGXN Meta Spec - The PGXN distribution metadata specification"><code>META.json</code></a>
file, and not to derive it from other sources that could change over time.</p>
<p>Following the <a href="https://github.com/andk/pause/blob/master/doc/operating-model.md#35-factors-considering-in-the-indexing-phase" title="The PAUSE Operating Model v2: Factors considering in the indexing phase">CPAN model</a>, PGXN also required that extension releases never
decrease the version.<a>1</a> The well-defined sortability of semantic versions
made this validation trivial. PGXN <a href="https://github.com/pgxn/pgxn-manager/commit/d2bd3bf" title="pgxn/pgxn-manager@d2bd3bf: Allow updates to old versions">later relaxed</a> enforcement to allow updates
to previously-released versions. SemVer’s <a href="https://semver.org/#spec-item-11" title="Semantic Versioning 2.0.0: Precedence refers to how versions are compared to each other when ordered.">clearly specified sorting</a> made this
change possible, as the <code>major.minor.patch</code> precedence intuitively compare from
left to right.</p>
<p>In other words, if one had previously released version 1.2.2, then released
1.3.0, a follow-up 1.2.3 is allowed, increasing the <code>1.2.x</code> branch version, but
not, say, 1.2.1, which decreases the <code>1.2.x</code> branch version.</p>
<p>Overall, semantic versions have been great for clarity of versioning of PGXN
extensions. The one bit of conflict comes from extensions that use some other
other version standard in the control file, usually a two-part <code>x.y</code> version not
allowed by SemVer, which requires <code>x.y.z</code> (or, more specifically,
<code>major.minor.patch</code>).</p>
<p>But such versions are usually compatible with SemVer, and because PGXN cares
only about the contents of the <code>META.json</code>, they’re free to use their own
versions in the control file, just as long as the <code>META.json</code> file uses SemVers.</p>
<p>For example, the recent <a href="https://pgxn.org/dist/nominatim_fdw/1.0.0/" title="nominatim_fdw 1.0.0: Nominatim Foreign Data Wrapper for PostgreSQL / PostgreSQL Extension Network">nominatim_fdw v1.0.0</a> release, which of course lists
<code>"version": "1.0.0"</code> in <a href="https://api.pgxn.org/src/nominatim_fdw/nominatim_fdw-1.0.0/META.json" title="nominatim_fdw 1.0.0 META.json">its <code>META.json</code> file</a>, sticks to its preferred
<code>default_version = '1.0'</code> in <a href="https://api.pgxn.org/src/nominatim_fdw/nominatim_fdw-1.0.0/nominatim_fdw.control" title="nominatim_fdw 1.0.0 nominatim_fdw.control">its control file</a>. The extension author simply
appends <code>.0</code> to create a valid SemVer from their preferred version, and as long
as they never use any other patch number, it remains compatible.</p>
 Versioning Alternatives 
<p>Surveying the versioning landscape in 2024 yields a number of approaches. Might
we prefer an alternative for future extensions distribution? Let’s look at the
possibilities.</p>
 Ad Hoc Versions 
<p>As described above, the Postgres <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/extend-extensions.html#EXTEND-EXTENSIONS-UPDATES" title="PostgreSQL Docs: “Packaging Related Objects into an Extension —&nbsp;Extension Updates”">file naming convention</a> allows ad hoc
versions. As far as I can tell, so does the <a href="https://www.r-project.org" title="The R Project for Statistical Computing">R Project</a>’s <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#The-DESCRIPTION-file" title="The Comprehensive R Archive Network: Writing R Extensions">CRAN</a>. This approach
seems fine for systems that don’t need to follow version changes themselves, but
much trickier for systems that do. If I want to install the latest version of an
extension, how does the installer know what that latest version is?</p>
<p>The answer is that the extension author must always release them in the proper
order. But if someone releases 1.3.1 of an extension, and then 1.2.1, well then
1.2.1 is the latest, isn’t it? It could get confusing pretty quickly.</p>
<p>Seems better to require some system, so that download and install clients can
get the latest version — or the latest maintenance version of an earlier
release if they need it.</p>
 User Choice 
<p>Quite a few registries allow users to choose their own versioning standards, but
generally with some very specific recommendations to prevent confusion for
users.</p>
 
 <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/discussions/versioning/" title="Python Packaging User Guide: Versioning">Python Packaging</a> is fairly liberal in the versions it allows, but strongly
recommends <a href="https://semver.org" title="Semantic Versioning">semantic versioning</a> or <a href="https://calver.org" title="CalVer: Timely Project Versioning">calendar versioning</a>
(more on that below). 
 <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/CPAN::Meta::Spec#VERSION-NUMBERS" title="CPAN::Meta::Spec: Version Numbers">CPAN (Perl)</a> is also fairly liberal, due to its long history of module
distribution, but currently requires “Decimal versions”, which are evaluated
as floating-point numbers, or dotted integer versions, which require
three dot-separated positive integers and must begin with the letter <code>v</code>. 
 <a href="https://guides.rubygems.org/patterns/#semantic-versioning" title="RubyGems Patterns: Semantic Versioning">RubyGems</a> does not enforce a versioning policy, but warns that “using an
‘irrational’ policy will only be a disservice to those in the community who
use your gems.” The project therefore urges developers to follow <a href="https://semver.org" title="Semantic Versioning">SemVer</a>. 
 
<p>These three venerable projects date from an earlier period of registration and
distribution, and have made concessions to times when no policies existed. Their
solutions either try to cover as many legacy examples as possible while
recommending better patterns going forward (Python, Perl), or simply make
recommendations and punt responsibility to developers.</p>
 SemVer 
<p>More recently-designed registries avoid this problem by requiring some level of
versioning standard from their inception. Nearly all use <a href="https://semver.org" title="Semantic Versioning">SemVer</a>, including:</p>
 
 <a href="https://go.dev/ref/mod#versions">Go Modules</a>, where “Each version starts with the letter v, followed by a
semantic version.” 
 <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/resolver.html#semver-compatibility">Cargo (Rust)</a>, which “uses SemVer for specifying version numbers. This
establishes a common convention for what is compatible between different
versions of a package.” 
 <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/configuring-npm/package-json#version">npm</a>, where the “version must be parseable by <a href="https://github.com/isaacs/node-semver" title="semver(1) -- The semantic versioner for npm">node-semver</a>, which is
bundled with npm as a dependency.” 
 
 CalVer 
<p><a href="https://calver.org" title="CalVer: Timely Project Versioning">CalVer</a> eschews context-free incrementing integers in favor of
semantically-meaningful versions, at least for some subset of a version string.
In other words: make the version date-based. CalVer-versioned projects usually
include the year and sometimes the month. Some examples:</p>
 
 <a href="https://ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle" title="The Ubuntu lifecycle and release cadence">Ubuntu</a> uses <code>YY.0M.MICRO</code>, e.g., <code>23.04</code>, released in April 2023, and
<code>23.10.1</code>, released in October 2023 
 <a href="https://pypi.org/project/Twisted/#history" title="Twisted Release History">Twisted</a> uses <code>YY.MM.MICRO</code>, e.g., <code>22.4.0</code>, released in April 2022 
 
<p>Ultimately, adoption of a CalVer format is a more choice about embedding
calendar-based meaning into a version more than standardizing a specific format.
One can of course use CalVer semantics in a semantic version, as in the Twisted
example, which is fully-SemVer compliant.</p>
<p>In other words, adoption of CalVer need not necessitate rejection of SemVer.</p>
 Package Managers 
<p>What about package managers, like RPM and Apt? Some canonical examples:</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPM_Package_Manager#Package_filename_and_label" title="Wikipedia: “RPM Package Manager — Package filename and label">RPM</a> packages use the format:</p>
 <code>&lt;name&gt;-&lt;version&gt;-&lt;release&gt;.&lt;architecture&gt;
</code> <p>Here <code>&lt;version&gt;</code> is the upstream version, but RPM practices a reasonable (if
baroque) <a href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2014/07/how-yum-and-rpm-compare-versions/" title="How Yum and RPM Compare Versions">version comparison</a> of all its parts. But it does not impose a
standard on upstream packages, since they of course vary tremendously
between communities and projects.</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html#standards-version">Apt</a> packages use a similar format:</p>
 <code>[epoch:]upstream_version[-debian_revision]
</code> <p>Again, <code>upstream_version</code> is the version of the upstream package, and not
enforced by Apt.</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/APKBUILD_Reference#pkgver">APK (Alpine Linux)</a> packages use the format</p>
 <code>{digit}{.digit}...{letter}{_suf{#}}...{-r#}
</code> <p>I believe that <code>{digit}{.digit}...{letter}</code> is the upstream package version.</p>
 
 
<p>This pattern makes perfect sense for registries that repackage software from
dozens of upstream sources that may or may not have their own policies. But a
system that defines the standard for a specific ecosystem, like Rust or
PostgreSQL, need not maintain that flexibility.</p>
 Recommendation 
<p>Given this survey, I’m inclined to recommend that the PostgreSQL community
follow the PGXN (and Go, and Rust, and npm) precedent and continue to rely on
and require <a href="https://semver.org" title="Semantic Versioning">semantic versions</a> for extension distribution. It’s not
perfect, given the contrast with the core’s lax version requirements. <a href="https://calver.org" title="CalVer: Timely Project Versioning">CalVer</a>
partisans can still use it, though with fewer formatting options (SemVer forbids

<p>But with its continuing adoption, and especially its requirement by more recent,
widely-used registries, and capacity to support date-based semantics for those
who desire it, I think it continues to make the most sense.</p>

the conclusion. Please tell me how I’ve messed up! Find me on the <a href="https://postgresteam.slack.com/archives/C056ZA93H1A" title="Postgres Slack/#extensions: Extensions and extension-related accessories">#extensions</a>

 The Solvable Problems of Mobile&nbsp;KYC <p>Remember endless hours ripping your CD collection to digital…why are we spending endless hours scanning analog ID documents over and over again? Alternatives exist. Let’s think differently about how Mobile KYC fails customers</p><p>A recent thread on a work-oriented social platform caught my attention. Some people I know to be the people they are could not verify their profiles using a mobile KYC solution. This article isn’t to bash those solutions, or the myriad improvements made, but to urge our industry to understand the complexity we’ve foisted on our users and incite action to do different.</p>Analog to Digital Conversion, anyone? “Ripping IDs” to confirm identity should go the way of Ripping&nbsp;CDs… How do I know the problems that&nbsp;exist? <p>In December 2014, before a presentation to the <a href="https://www.idesg.org/The-ID-Ecosystem/Overview.html">Identity Ecosystem Steering Group</a> about how to “Bring the trust of the Driver’s license online”, MorphoTrust USA filed a provisional application that became <a href="https://patents.justia.com/patent/10678939">US Patent 10,678,939</a>. The front-back-selfie wave was born, admittedly without the system of record connection described in that patent text. I spent several years leading a smart team improving an identity verification product&nbsp;line.</p><p>I’ve watched thousands of people try to run these selfie-to-DL matching steps in various forms and helped debug their issues with smiles, vision acuity, phone models, and lighting. I’ve spent weekends helping <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/with-afcu-onboard-utah-plans-selfie-enrollment-for-mobile-drivers-license/">hundreds of great Utahns use mobile registration live in a credit union&nbsp;lobby</a>.</p><p>Visually impaired people cannot get over these hurdles. It takes too many hands for these solutions to be inclusive. Back-facing phone camera quality varies greatly with how much you can spend. These solutions are not inclusive by any stretch of the imagination, and the fallback is to go to a physical location.</p> The Places Within the Selfie-ID Verification Process that&nbsp;Fail   Manually taking a quality, flat, well-lit, high-res picture of a card is&nbsp;hard  Taking an <a href="https://global.itu.edu.tr/docs/librariesprovider33/default-document-library/%C4%B1cao-standarts.pdf?sfvrsn=c9eea239_0">ICAO-quality</a>, well-lit, machine-matchable portrait is difficult. Everybody wants to smile (or make duck lips&nbsp;…idk…) in a&nbsp;selfie  Webcams are very low resolution compared to phones and vary&nbsp;widely  <a href="https://freeaamvapdf417generator.com/">PDF417 Barcodes</a> from the back of DL/ID cards are easy to generate and <a href="https://www.lseg.com/en/insights/risk-intelligence/2024-will-ai-break-content-based-identity-verification">nearly every Fake ID</a> has the same information on the back and&nbsp;front  Connections to databases that would verify the authenticity and validity of a DL/ID are expensive or restricted to law enforcement (makes&nbsp;sense)  Most hard-to-forge security features of an ID card require multi-spectral light, are tactile, or require magnification. Phones capture visible&nbsp;light  Cropping the card portrait results in a small, low-res photo for machine-matching that has security lines, holograms, and indicia through&nbsp;it  Cropping a portrait from a poorly captured, low-res ID card will not give sufficient resolution to measure the facial features for&nbsp;matching  You need cloud/phone processing power to determine that a human is live and real for the probe image — called <a href="https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/2020/09/15/12_buschthieme-ibpc-pad-160504.pdf">Presentation Attack Detection</a>  I have to ID myself repeatedly with each new service that wants (notice I didn’t say “needs”) ID and each KYC system differs, creating&nbsp;doubt  <p>Can I stop here? We haven’t even gotten to the accuracy of biometric matching algorithms (new entries, if used, have solved any racial/gender bias, so lighting is the major hurdle to accurate matching). People think biometrics are 100% when a human visual verificdation is only ~97% (per a 2017 Google study that I cannot&nbsp;find).</p><p>Oh, did I mention that people end up with images of their IDs in photo rolls and synchronized to every app they grant photo library permission?</p><p>Humans are humans and will do what humans do using technology.</p>You simply cannot account for the variations people and machines will cause to happen (credit Jurassic&nbsp;Park)<p>If there are this many variables to a process that seems conceptually simple, one or more of those variables will go&nbsp;wrong.</p> We are turning away good potential customers <p>There are tremendous capture, scan, photo, and biometric matching systems out there from excellent, reputable vendors. The improvements in the decade since selfie matching started are incredible and laudable. This process is significantly easier and more accurate than it ever&nbsp;was.</p><p>Still, people sitting at their desks get turned away from having “verified profiles”. Now try taking a picture of your ID with one hand, holding your phone in the other, on a sidewalk balancing your potential rental scooter against your hip in bright, vacation sunlight. Ya,&nbsp;no!</p> Let’s go&nbsp;Digital <p>Mobile Driver’s Licenses (mDL) are now available to<a href="https://www.mdlconnection.com/implementation-tracker-map/"> greater than 17% of the US</a> cardholding population. Adoption isn’t awesome yet because people don’t know they have existed in production for nearly 2 years and <a href="https://medium.com/@dkelts.id/mobile-driver-licenses-mdl-how-to-use-iso-18013-5-5a1bbc1a37a3">in concept for four-plus years</a>. ISO/IEC 18013–5 is solid and functional. The data is digitally signed by your Issuer but you control it. It provides a level of control over data and transparency into data-storage that users haven’t experienced for decades. There are <a href="https://mobiledl.us/verify/">verifier</a> <a href="https://www.oneproof.co/mdl">apps</a> and <a href="https://credenceid.com/tap2id">equipment</a> from multiple vendors. Places <a href="https://dld.utah.gov/mdlusage/">do accept&nbsp;mDL</a>.</p><p>In the coming months of 2024, ISO/IEC 18013–7 will add consented, selective-disclosure, digitally-signed mDL sharing to apps on the same device AND to websites over the Internet. (This will be the topic of a forthcoming post of mine.) So imagine sharing just your age to be granted entry to that website you don’t want your name associated with… or accurately filing for benefits without typing into a form. During the final approval stages, the ISO/IEC 18013–7 Technical Specification will be available for implementation.</p> Let’s Go Digital to&nbsp;Digital <p>“The first bank to replace their Mobile KYC with a connection to a Mobile Driver’s License is going to garner attention from the press and obtain new customers.”</p><p>It’s time.</p><p>The mDL provides digitally signed, matchable portraits upon consent as well as only the digitally signed data relevant for the approval. ISO/IEC 18013–7 will allow app-to-app consent and retrieval of mDL data similar to the way your email launches your airline application. It will also present a subset of mDL data to a website after consent for uses like age verification.</p><p>The challenge is made: Let’s short-circuit problems 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10 above. Let’s make better self-registration and selfie-KYC solutions. Let’s work together on mDL acceptance.

<p>These challenges and the interest and energy put into exploring new solutions

<p>This article shows how to use a CSP nonce in a Blazor Web application using the InteractiveServer server render mode. Using a CSP nonce is a great way to protect web applications against XSS attacks and other such Javascript vulnerabilities.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/BlazorServerOidc">https://github.com/damienbod/BlazorServerOidc</a></p>







<p></p>



 Notes 



<p>The code in this example was built using the example provided by <a href="https://github.com/javiercn">Javier Calvarro Nelson</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/javiercn/BlazorWebNonceService">https://github.com/javiercn/BlazorWebNonceService</a></p>



 Services and middleware 



<p>The Blazor Web application is implemented using the AddInteractiveServerComponents for the InteractiveServer server render mode. The nonce can be used by implementing a nonce service using the CircuitHandler. The nonce service is a scoped service.</p>


  builder.Services.AddRazorComponents()
	.AddInteractiveServerComponents();

builder.Services.TryAddEnumerable(ServiceDescriptor
	.Scoped&lt;CircuitHandler, BlazorNonceService&gt;(sp =&gt;
		sp.GetRequiredService&lt;BlazorNonceService&gt;()));

builder.Services.AddScoped&lt;BlazorNonceService&gt;();
  


<p>The headers are implemented using the NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders package. The headers are added to the Blazor nonce service using the NonceMiddleware middleware.</p>


  app.UseSecurityHeaders(SecurityHeadersDefinitions.GetHeaderPolicyCollection(
	app.Environment.IsDevelopment(),
	app.Configuration["OpenIDConnectSettings:Authority"]));

app.UseMiddleware&lt;NonceMiddleware&gt;();
  


 Setup Security headers 



<p>The security headers CSP script tag is setup as best possible for a Blazor Web application. A CSP nonce is used as well as the fallback definitions for older browsers.</p>


  .AddContentSecurityPolicy(builder =&gt;
{
    builder.AddObjectSrc().None();
    builder.AddBlockAllMixedContent();
    builder.AddImgSrc().Self().From("data:");
    builder.AddFormAction().Self().From(idpHost);
    builder.AddFontSrc().Self();
    builder.AddBaseUri().Self();
    builder.AddFrameAncestors().None();

    builder.AddStyleSrc()
		.UnsafeInline()
		.Self();

    // due to Blazor
    builder.AddScriptSrc()
		.WithNonce()
		.UnsafeEval() // due to Blazor WASM
		.StrictDynamic()
		.OverHttps()
		.UnsafeInline(); // fallback for older browsers when the nonce is used 
})
  


 Setup Middleware to add the nonce to the state 



<p>The NonceMiddleware uses the nonce header created by the security headers package and sets the Blazor nonce service with the value. This is updated on every request.</p>


  namespace BlazorWebFromBlazorServerOidc;

public class NonceMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;

    public NonceMiddleware(RequestDelegate next)
    {
        _next = next;
    }

    public async Task Invoke(HttpContext context, 
          BlazorNonceService blazorNonceService)
    {
        var success = context.Items.TryGetValue(
          "NETESCAPADES_NONCE", out var nonce);

        if (success &amp;&amp; nonce != null)
        {
            blazorNonceService.SetNonce(nonce.ToString()!);
        }
        await _next.Invoke(context);
    }
}
  


 Using the nonce in the UI 



<p>The BlazorNonceService can be used from the Blazor components in the InteractiveServer render mode. The nonce is applied to all script tags. If the script does not have the correct nonce, it will not be loaded. The GetNonce method reads the nonce value from the BlazorNonceService service.</p>


  @inject IHostEnvironment Env
@inject BlazorNonceService BlazorNonceService
@using System.Security.Cryptography;

&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8" /&gt;

    &lt;link href="BlazorWebFromBlazorServerOidc.styles.css" rel="stylesheet" /&gt;
    &lt;HeadOutlet @rendermode="InteractiveServer" /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;Routes @rendermode="InteractiveServer" /&gt;

    http://_framework/blazor.web.js
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

@code
{
    /// &lt;summary&gt;
    /// Original src: https://github.com/javiercn/BlazorWebNonceService
    /// &lt;/summary&gt;
    [CascadingParameter] HttpContext Context { get; set; } = default!;

    protected override void OnInitialized()
    {
        var nonce = GetNonce();
        if (nonce != null)
        {
            BlazorNonceService.SetNonce(nonce);
        }
    }

    public string? GetNonce()
    {
        if (Context.Items.TryGetValue("nonce", out var item) 
           &amp;&amp; item is string nonce and not null)
        {
            return nonce;
        }

        return null;
    }
}
  


 Notes 



<p>Nonces can be applied to Blazor Web using the server rendered mode and the BlazorNonceService which implements the CircuitHandler. Thanks the <a href="https://github.com/javiercn">Javier Calvarro Nelson</a> for providing a solution to this. Next would be to find a solution for the AddInteractiveWebAssemblyComponents setup. You should always use a CSP nonce on a server rendered application and only load scripts with the CSP nonce applied to it.</p>

Michael Bassey Johnson,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/96258745">The

<p>As
many of you already know, SAP has made public its plans on how SAP
IDM will be retired as a supported offering. I’ve been stewing on
this for a bit as I try to figure out exactly how I feel about this
and what needs to happen next.</p>
<p>To
be fair, I haven’t worked with the product much for just over four
years, and even then, I was working more with Version 7 than with
Version 8. My opinions are completely my own and do not represent my
current employer, any previous employer, or SAP.</p>
<p>While
IDM is certainly showing its age, there are some very good things
about it that I would love to see as an open-source offering. First
is the Batch Processing capabilities of IDM, based on the old MaXware
Data Synchronization Engine/MetaCenter solutions. It features some
powerful functionality to synchronize and cleanse data. It sets up
fairly easily and is quite easy to configure. I’m sure the
open-source community could do well with maintaining the UI (It
definitely should be JAVA-based rather than the old Windows MMC) that
will fit better in today’s Enterprise setting. Also, easy
integration with SaaS services is a needed upgrade.</p>
<p>The
other thing that should be released into the wild is the Virtual
Directory. It also provides powerful functionality for several use
cases, from pass-through authentication to assisting in M&amp;A use
cases. It’s the perfect example of a “Black Box” offering that
just works. It also makes it much easier to synchronize and cleanse
data by representing many different back ends via the easy-to-consume
LDAP standard.</p>
<p>It
saddens me that SAP is choosing to move away from IDM, as one of the
key selling points of SAP IDM is its ability to integrate seamlessly
with the SAP ecosystem. I hope SAP will help all LCM/IGA vendors
connect more easily with systems. SaaS integration should be easy or
standards-based, but we still need to be concerned for organizations
still using on-premises SAP tools.</p>
<p>SAP
has indicated that Microsoft’s Entra ID will be the main partner in
the future, but I hope they make this information open to all vendors
and that there will be continuing support of standard protocols.
This&nbsp;<a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blogs-by-sap/preparing-for-sap-identity-management-s-end-of-maintenance-in-2027/ba-p/13596101#:~:text=Maintenance%20for%20SAP%20Identity%20Management,a%20well-considered%20migration%20strategy.">article</a>&nbsp;gives
me some hope, but actions speak louder than words. I do have some
concerns that SAP, known as a vast software ecosystem that supports
itself and tends to ignore the enterprise, is handing off to another
large software provider whose management tools tend to support their
software ecosystem first and consider the enterprise second. Let’s
face it: most of Microsoft’s Identity and Access Management efforts
have been about supporting the Office 365 family of products. Don’t
get me wrong; it’s better than SAP in this regard, but it’s not
that high of a level to meet. For what it’s worth, I am guardedly
optimistic, but I always try to remain hopeful.</p>
<p>Finally,
I think it’s important to thank the IDM team in Sofia for all their
hard work over the years, which, of course, would not have been
possible without the vision and effort of the original MaXware team
based in Trondheim, Norway, and associated teams in the UK,
Australia, and the US. The production from these small teams helped
define what Identity Management is to this day.</p>
<p>Will
this be my last blog entry on the topic of SAP IDM? I don’t know.
Part of it will depend on if there are any moves towards the Open
Source world. There have been at least three times in my life when I
thought I was done with this tool, and deep down, I’m pretty sure
there is a little more in my future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In
the meantime, I hope to resume blogging more regarding the Identity
and Access Management field in the near future. Time will tell.</p>

  <p>In 2024, the <a href="https://www.republicworld.com/tech/artificial-intelligence/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-urges-nations-to-develop-sovereign-ai-infrastructure/">utility of words</a> yielding philosophical clarity that becomes embedded into the <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/world-governments-summit/">design</a> of systems being deployed globally, and Nationally, yields methods that must be structured accurately in order to abide by the Sovereign systems they serve.</p><p>In America, people own root authority, or the Sovereign infrastructure does not confer accuracy for, of, by human use. Data is the life blood of AI systems. Data structure yields Sovereign results, and across our fast advancing world, inaccuracy deconstructs faster than accuracy builds accurately. The time has come for open transparent accuracy in the data structure of Soveriegnty itself to be laid bare, enabling the development of "Sovereign AI" upon foundations that serve people.</p><p>Many moons ago, this structural conversation began in the world of identity management. Professionally-deployed systems were challenged to confront inaccuracies in their modeling of human identity. Ubiquitously, people were no longer being conveyed structural constraints ensuring the structural accuracy of their root administrative authority over data systems of ultimate importance to their Sovereign participation and administration under well-founded laws that were crafted pre-tcp/ip, pre-digital data.</p><p>Identity systems have been challenged now for over 20 years to align their practices to the people they service. The work is not done. Self-Sovereign ID principles that emerged here on this blog, led to decentralized identity methods and practices advancing for developer use, and into general awareness by a population that is intensely interested in digital frontiers where their lives meet opportunity, security, and civil system integrity. The fire walls of Sovereign integrity, having been breached many times in consequential ways, started exposing their own structural deficiencies.</p><p>Enter AI: human identity that primarily exists in a database-driven system, and is founded on an old-era of physical presence, is now the domain of AI. Human beings can not compete structurally here, as AI derives utility that people provide, and far too often, provide ignorantly, without much personal insight or accountability for the structural choices conveyed upon them. Laws, as dependencies function, evolve at a much slower pace, and seem to lack insight into the structural underpinnings of identity silos that tcp/ip was advanced to break down and add utility too. Unfortunately, protections were not advanced with the same insight, and civil society is finding itself in a reactive mode, reacting to change like a surfer riding a wave, rather than a break wall securing civil participation in an AI-enabled society.</p><p>This is the moment. AI Sovereignty has a basic and tremendously important dependency in American civil society: people own root.&nbsp;</p><p>If the data structure of human participation in America does not convey this basic structural reality, then people do not exist in a civil society, as defined by founding documents, intent, and Constitutional reach. Work is underway on this vector, and as always, the resulting choices and structures advanced will yield the results being pursued. The question on the table being asked is simple: do innovators understand what it means in structural Terms to ensure that people own root authority?&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/The_AI_Investor/status/1756949748752539731">"Own Your Own AI"</a></p>

  <p>When a person is already logged into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(social_network)">mastodon</a> instance, if they visit some pages on their instance associated with a user from another server, they are not redirected to the remote server because it is easier to interact with the remote user with their existing local session.  However, if a person without an account is just visiting or they have an account but are logged out, mastodon redirects them to the remote server presumably because mastodon doesn’t know whether they have a local account and visiting the remote server will have the complete and authoritative data for that remote user.</p>

<p>A welcome update to <a href="https://mastodon.social">mastodon.social</a> (included in 4.3.0-nightly) is a <a href="https://mastodon.social/@Gargron/111908524315478487">warning</a> presented to visitors or logged out users before mastodon redirects them to a remote server for the original page.  The <a href="https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/commit/b19ae521b7d28a76e8e1d8da8157e051e9d8de6c">code</a> for <a href="https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/pull/27792">Add confirmation when redirecting logged-out requests to permalink</a> is particularly relevant to mastodon.social compared to other fediverse instances as mastodon.social has become a relatively big target for phishing.  It’s a good bet that if someone is navigating the fediverse that their account is on mastodon.social.  So, if an arbitrary victim is logged out of their mastodon.social account and visits a mastodon.social page belonging to the attacker, prior to this mitigation, mastodon.social would automatically redirect the victim to the attacker’s page which might be a fake login form to trick the victim into submitting their login credentials to the attacker’s site.  Unfortunately, a significant percentage of people will submit the form.</p>

<p>One could imagine mastodon.social maintaining a list of trusted servers for automatic redirects but that would be an undesirable hornet’s nest and it’s not a bad thing when web surfers are conscious of the trust boundaries on the web.</p>

Cliche or not, there's another aspect of using an ID to buy beer that I want to focus on: it's an excellent example of <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2023/08/zero_trust.shtml">zero trust</a></p><blockquote><p>Zero Trust operates on a simple, yet powerful principle: “assume breach.” In a world where network boundaries are increasingly porous and cyber threats are more evasive than ever, the Zero Trust model centers around the notion that no one, whether internal or external, should be inherently trusted. This approach mandates continuous verification, strict access controls, and micro-segmentation, ensuring that every user and device proves their legitimacy before gaining access to sensitive resources. If we assume breach, then the only strategy that can protect the corporate network, infrastructure, applications, and people is to authorize every access.</p><p>From <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2023/08/zero_trust.shtml">Zero Trust</a><br>Referenced 2024-02-09T08:25:55-0500</p></blockquote><p>The real world is full of zero trust examples. When we're controlling access to something in the physical world—beer, a movie, a boarding gate, points in a loyalty program, prescriptions, and so on—we almost invariably use a zero trust model. We authorize every access. This isn't surprising, the physical world is remarkably decentralized and there aren't many natural boundaries to exploit and artificial boundaries are expensive and inconvenient.</p><p>The other thing that's interesting about zero trust in the physical world is that authorization is also usually done using <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2023/10/zero_data.shtml">Zero Data</a>. Zero data is a name <a href="https://www.citizenme.com/the-future-of-data-is-zero-data/">StJohn Deakin gave</a> to the concept of using data gathered just in time to make authorization and other decisions rather than relying on great stores of data. There are obvious security benefits from storing less data, but zero data also offers significantly greater convenience for people and organizations alike. To top all that off, it can save money by reducing the number of partner integrations (i.e., far fewer federations) and enable applications that have far greater scale.</p><p>Let's examine these benefits in the scenario I opened with. Imagine that instead of using a credential (e.g., driver's license) to prove your age when buying beer, we ran convenience stores like a web site. Before you could shop, you'd have to register an account. And if you wanted to buy beer, the company would have to <a href="https://www.citizenme.com/the-future-of-data-is-zero-data/">proof the identity of the person</a> to ensure they're over 21. Now when you buy beer at the store, you'd log in so the system could use your stored attributes to ensure you were allowed to buy beer.</p><p>This scenario is still zero trust, but not zero data. And it's ludicrous to imagine anyone would put up with it, but we do it everyday online. I don't know about you, but I'm comforted to know that every convenience store I visit doesn't have a store of all kinds of information about me in an account somewhere. Zero data stores less data that can be exploited by hackers (or the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/05/can_the_digital_future_be_our_home.shtml">companies we trust with it</a>).</p><p>The benefit of scale is obvious as well. In a zero data, zero trust scenario we don't have to have long-term transactional relationships with every store, movie, restaurant, and barber shop we visit. They don't have to maintain federation relationships with numerous identity providers. There are places where the ability to scale zero trust really matters. For example, it's impossible for every hospital to have a relationship with every other hospital for purposes of <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/05/building_an_ssi_ecosystem_digital_staff_passports_at_the_nhs.shtml">authorizing access for medical personal who move or need temporary access</a>. Similarly, airline personal move between numerous airports and need access to various facilities at airports.</p><p>How do we build zero data, zero trust systems? By using <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/06/ssi_interaction_patterns.shtml">verifiable credentials</a> to transfer attributes about their subject in a way that is decentralized and yet trustworthy. Zero data aligns our online existence more closely with our real-world interactions, fostering new methods of communication while decreasing the challenges and risks associated with amassing, storing, and utilizing vast amounts of data.</p><p>Just-in-time, zero data, attribute transfer can make many zero trust scenarios more realizable because it's more flexible. Zero trust with zero data, facilitated by verifiable credentials, represents a pivotal transition in how digital identity is used in authorization decisions. By minimizing centralized data storage and emphasizing cryptographic verifiability, this approach aims to address the prevalent challenges in data management, security, and user trust. By allowing online interactions to more faithfully follow established patterns of transferring trust from the physical world, zero trust with zero data promotes better security with increased convenience and lower cost. What's not to like?</p><p>You can get more detail on many of the concepts in this post like verifiable credentials in my new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1098117697/technometria-20">Learning Digital Identity</a> from O'Reilly Media.</p> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1098117697/technometria-20">   </a>    <p>Photo Credit: We ID Everyone from DALL-E (Public Domain) DALL-E apparently thinks a six-pack has 8 bottles but this was the best of several attempts.</p>

<p>As I started digging into the <a href="https://gist.github.com/theory/898c8802937ad8361ccbcc313054c29d" title="Extension Ecosystem: Jobs and Tools">jobs and tools</a> for the Postgres extension
ecosystem as part of my <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/01/tembonaut/" title="I'm a Postgres Extensions Tembonaut">new gig</a>, I realized that most people have little
knowledge of the <a href="https://pgxn.org" title="PGXN — PostgreSQL Extension Network">PGXN</a> architecture. I learned a lot designing PGXN and its
services, and am quite pleased with where it ended up, warts and all. So I
thought it worthwhile to put together a brief presentation on the fundamental
design principals (static REST file API), inter-related services (<a href="https://master.pgxn.org/" title="PGXN Root Mirror">root mirror</a>,

<p>Yesterday, the Tembo blog <a href="https://tembo.io/blog/pgxn-architecture" title="Presentation: Introduction to the PGXN Architecture">published the presentation</a>, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjZPA3HA_q8" title="YouTube Tembo Channel: “David Wheeler - The Architecture of PGXN”">the video</a>

point of reference for the Postgres community as we look to better distribute
extensions in the future.</p>

 TL;DR 
<p>As I think through the future of the Postgres extension ecosystem as a key part
of the <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/01/tembonaut/" title="I'm a Postgres Extensions Tembonaut">new job</a>, I wanted to understand how <a href="https://go.dev/doc/modules/developing#decentralized" title="go.dev: Developing and publishing modules">Go decentralized publishing</a>
works. In this post I work it out, and think through how we might do something
similar for Postgres extension publishing. It covers the
<a>Go architecture</a>, <a>namespacing challenges</a>,
and <a>PGXS abuse</a>; then experiments with
<a>URL-based namespacing</a> and ponders
<a>reorganizing installed extension files</a>;
and closes with a <a>high-level design</a> for
making it work now and in the future.</p>
<p>It is, admittedly, a lot, mainly written for my own edification and for the
information of my fellow extension-releasing travelers.</p>
<p>I find it fascinating and learned a ton. Maybe you will too! But feel free to
skip this post if you’re less interested in the details of the journey and want
to wait for more decisive posts once I’ve reached the destination.</p>
 Introduction 
<p>Most language registries require developers to take some step to make releases.
Many automate the process in CI/CD pipelines, but it requires some amount of
effort on the developer’s part:</p>
 
 Register for an account 
 Learn how to format things to publish a release 
 Remember to publish again for every new version 
 Create a pipeline to automate publishing (e.g., a GitHub workflow) 
 
 Decentralized Publishing 
<p><a href="https://go.dev/doc/modules/developing#decentralized" title="go.dev: Developing and publishing modules">Go decentralized publishing</a> has revised this pattern: it does not require user
registration or authentication to to publish a module to <a href="https://pkg.go.dev">pkg.go.dev</a>. Rather,
Go developers simply tag the source repository, and the first time someone
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/about#adding-a-package" title="pkg.go.dev: Adding a package">refers to the tag in Go tools</a>, the <a href="https://index.golang.org">Go module index</a> will include it.</p>
<p>For example, publishing <code>v1.2.1</code> of a module in the <code>github.com/golang/example</code>
repository takes just three commands:</p>
  <code>git tag v1.2.1 -sm 'Tag v1.2.1'
git push --tags
go list -m github.com/golang/example@v1.2.1
</code>  <p>After a few minutes, the module will show up in <a href="https://index.golang.org/index" title="Go module index feed">the index</a> and then on
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev">pkg.go.dev</a>. Anyone can run <code>go get -u github.com/golang/example</code> to get the
latest version. Go developers rest easy in the knowledge that they’re getting
the exact module they need thanks to the <a href="https://go.dev/ref/mod#checksum-database" title="Go Modules Reference: Checksum database">global checksum database</a>, which Go
uses “in many situations to detect misbehavior by proxies or origin servers”.</p>
<p>This design requires <code>go get</code> to understand multiple source code management
systems: it supports Git, Subversion, Mercurial, Bazaar, and Fossil.<a>1</a>
It also needs the <code>go.mod</code> metadata file to live in the project defining the
package.</p>
<p>But that’s really it. From the developer’s perspective it could not be easier to
publish a module, because it’s a natural extension of the module development
tooling and workflow of committing, tagging, and fetching code.</p>
 Decentralized Extension Publishing 
<p>Could we publish Postgres extensions in such a decentralized pattern? It might
look something like this:</p>
 
 The developer places a metadata file in the proper location (<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/extend-extensions.html#EXTEND-EXTENSIONS-FILES" title="PostgreSQL Docs: Extension Files">control file</a>,
<code>META.json</code>, <code>Cargo.toml</code>, whatever — standard TBD) 
 To publish a release, the developer tags the repository and calls some sort
of indexing service hook (perhaps from a tag-triggered release workflow) 
 The indexing service validates the extension and adds it to the index 
 
<p>Note that there is no registration required. It simply trusts the source code
repository. It also avoids name collision: <code>github.com/bob/hash</code>
is distinct from <code>github.com/carol/hash</code>.</p>
<p>This design does raise challenges for clients, whether they’re compiling
extensions on a production system or building binary packages for distribution:
they have to support various version control systems to pull the code (though
starting with Git is a decent 90% solution).</p>
 Namespacing 
<p>Then there’s name conflicts. Perhaps <code>github.com/bob/hash</code> and
<code>github.com/carol/hash</code> both create an extension named <code>hash</code>. By the current
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/extend-extensions.html#EXTEND-EXTENSIONS-FILES" title="PostgreSQL Docs: Extension Files">control file</a> format, the script directory and module path can use any name,
but in all likelihood the use these defaults:</p>
  <code>directory = 'extension'
module_pathname = '$libdir/hash'
</code>  <p>Meaning <code>.sql</code> files will be installed in the Postgres <code>share/extension</code>
subdirectory — along with all the other installed extensions — and library
files will be installed in the library directory along with all other libraries.
Something like this:</p>
 <code>pgsql
├── lib
│   └── hash.so
└── share
    └── extension
    │   └── hash.control
    │&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── hash--1.0.0.sql
    └── doc
        └── hash.md
</code> <p>If both projects include, say, <code>hash.control</code>, <code>hash--1.0.0.sql</code>, and <code>hash.so</code>,
the files from one will stomp all over the files of the other.</p>
 Installer Abuse 
<p>Go avoids this issue by using the domain and path from each package’s repository
in its directory structure. For example, here’s a list of modules from
<code>google.golang.org</code> repositories:</p>
  <code>$ ls -1 ~/go/pkg/mod/google.golang.org
api@v0.134.0
api@v0.152.0
appengine@v1.6.7
genproto
genproto@v0.0.0-20230731193218-e0aa005b6bdf
grpc@v1.57.0
grpc@v1.59.0
protobuf@v1.30.0
protobuf@v1.31.0
protobuf@v1.32.0
</code>  <p>The <code>~/go/pkg/mod</code> directory has subdirectories for each VCS host name, and each
then subdirectories for package paths. For the <code>github.com/bob/hash</code> example,
the files would all live in <code>~/go/pkg/mod/github.com/bob/hash</code>.</p>
<p>Could a Postgres extension build tool follow a similar distributed pattern by
renaming the control file and installation files and directories to something
specific for each, say <code>github.com+bob+hash</code> and <code>github.com+carol+hash</code>? That
is, using the repository host name and path, but replacing the slashes in the
path with some other character that wouldn’t create subdirectories — because
PostgreSQL won’t find control files in subdirectories. The control file entries
for <code>github.com/carol/hash</code> would look like this:</p>
  <code>directory = 'github.com+carol+hash'
module_pathname = '$libdir/github.com+carol+hash'
</code>  <p>Since PostgreSQL expects the control file to have the same name as the
extension, and for SQL scripts to start with that name, the files would have to
be named like so:</p>
 <code>hash
├── Makefile
├── github.com+carol+hash.control
└── sql
    └── github.com+carol+hash--1.0.0.sql
</code> <p>And the <code>Makefile</code> contents:</p>
  <code>EXTENSION  = github.com+carol+hash
MODULEDIR  = $(EXTENSION)
DATA       = sql/$(EXTENSION)--1.0.0.sql
PG_CONFIG ?= pg_config

PGXS := $(shell $(PG_CONFIG) --pgxs)
include $(PGXS)
</code>  <p>In other words, the extension name is the full repository host name and path and
the Makefile <code>MODULEDIR</code> variable tells <code>pg_config</code> to put all the SQL and
documentation files into a directories named <code>github.com+carol+hash</code> —
preventing them from conflicting with any other extension.</p>
<p>Finally, the <code>github.com+carol+hash.control</code> file — so named becaus it must
have the same name as the extension — contains:</p>
  <code>default_version = '1.0.0'
relocatable = true
directory = 'github.com+carol+hash'
module_pathname = '$libdir/github.com+carol+hash'
</code>  <p>Note the <code>directory</code> parameter, which must match <code>MODULEDIR</code> from the
<code>Makefile</code>, so that <code>CREATE EXTENSION</code> can find the SQL files. Meanwhile,
<code>module_pathname</code> ensures that the library file has a unique name — the same
as the long extension name — again to avoid conflicts with other projects.</p>
<p>That unsightly naming extends to SQL: using the URL format could get to be a
mouthful:</p>
  <code>CREATE EXTENSION "github.com+carol+hash";
</code>  <p>Which is do-able, but some new SQL syntax might be useful, perhaps something
like:</p>
  <code>CREATE EXTENSION hash FROM "github.com+carol+hash";
</code>  <p>Or, if we’re gonna really go for it, use slashes after all!</p>
  <code>CREATE EXTENSION hash FROM "github.com/carol/hash";
</code>  <p>Want to use both extensions but they have conflicting objects (e.g., both create
a “hash” data type)? Put them into separatre schemas (assuming
<code>relocatable = true</code> in the control file):</p>
  <code>CREATE EXTENSION hash FROM "github.com/carol/hash" WITH SCHEMA carol;
CREATE EXTENSION hash FROM "github.com/bob/hash" WITH SCHEMA bob;
CREATE TABLE try (
    h1 carol.hash,
    h2 bob.hash
);
</code>  <p>Of course it would be nice if PostgreSQL added support for something like
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/LNPLS/packages.htm" title="Oracle Docs: PL/SQL Packages">Oracle packages</a>, but using schemas in the meantime may be sufficient.</p>
<p>Clearly we’re getting into changes to the PostgreSQL core, so put that aside and
we can just use long names for creating, modifying, and dropping extensions, but
not necessarily otherwise:</p>
  <code>CREATE EXTENSION "github.com+carol+hash" WITH SCHEMA carol;
CREATE EXTENSION "github.com+bob+hash" WITH SCHEMA bob;
CREATE EXTENSION "gitlab.com+barack+kicker_type";
CREATE TABLE try (
    h1 carol.hash,
    h2 bob.hash
    kt kicker
);
</code>   Namespacing Experiment 
<p>To confirm that this approach might work, I committed <a href="https://github.com/theory/pg-semver/commit/24134fd" title="pg-semver@24134fd: Use domain-qualified name for extension">24134fd</a> and pushed it in
the <a href="https://github.com/theory/pg-semver/tree/namespace-experiment" title="pg_semver@namespace-experiment: Experimental branch to try naming an extension with a source code repository URL similar to Go packages">namespace-experiment</a> branch of <a href="https://github.com/theory/pg-semver">the semver extension</a>. This commit changes
the extension name from <code>semver</code> to <code>github.com+theory+pg-semver</code>, and follows
the above steps to ensure that its files are installed with that name.</p>
<p>Abusing the Postgres extension installation infrastructure like this does
work, but suffers from a number of drawbacks, including:</p>
 
 The extension name is super long, as before, but now so too are the files in
the repository (as opposed to the installer renaming them on install). The
shared library file has to have the long name, so therefore does the <code>.c</code>
source file. The SQL files must all start with
<code>github.com+theory+pg-semver</code>, although I skipped that bit in this commit;
instead the <code>Makefile</code> generates just one from <code>sql/semver.sql</code>. 
 Any previous installation of the <code>semver</code> type would remain unchanged, with
no upgrade path. Changing an extension’s name isn’t a great idea. 
 
<p>I could probably script renaming and modifying file contents like this and make
it part of the build process, but it starts to get complicated. We could also
modify installers to make the changes, but there are a bunch of moving parts
they would have to compensate for, and given how dynamic this can be (e.g., the
semver <code>Makefile</code> reads the extension name from <code>META.json</code>), we would rapidly
enter the territory of edge case <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whac-A-Mole" title="Wikipedia: “Whac-A-Mole”">whac-a-mole</a>. I suspect it’s simply too
error-prone.</p>
 Proposal: Update Postgres Extension Packaging 
<p>Perhaps the Go directory pattern could inspire a similar model in Postgres,
eliminating the namespace issue by teaching the Postgres extension
infrastructure to include all but one of the files for an extension in a
single directory. In other words, rather than files distributed like so for
semver:</p>
 <code>pgsql
├── lib
│   └── semver.so
└── share
    └── extension
    │   └── semver.control
    │&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── semver--0.32.1.sql
    │&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── semver--0.32.0--0.32.1.sql
    └── doc
        └── semver.md
</code> <p>Make it more like this:</p>
 <code>pgsql
└── share
    └── extension
        └── github.com
            └── theory
                └── pg-semver
                    └── extension.control
                    └── lib
                    │   └── semver.so
                    └── sql
                    │   └── semver--0.32.1.sql
                    │   └── semver--0.32.0--0.32.1.sql
                    └── doc
                        └── semver.md
</code> <p>Or perhaps:</p>
 <code>pgsql
└── share
    └── extension
        └── github.com
            └── theory
                └── pg-semver
                    └── extension.control
                    └── semver.so
                    └── semver--0.32.1.sql
                    └── semver--0.32.0--0.32.1.sql
                    └── semver.md
</code> <p>The idea is to copy the files exactly as they’re stored in or compiled in the
repository. Meanwhile, the new <code>semver.name</code> file — the only relevant file
stored outside the extension module directory — simply points to that path:</p>
  <code>github.com/theory/pg-semver
</code>  <p>Then for <code>CREATE EXTENSION semver</code>, Postgres reads <code>semver.name</code> and knows where
to find all the files to load the extension.</p>
<p>This configuration would require updates to the control file, now named
<code>extension.control</code>, to record the full package name and appropriate locations.
Add:</p>
  <code>name = 'semver'
package = 'github.com/theory/pg-semver'
</code>  <p>This pattern could also allow aliasing. Say we try to install a different
<code>semver</code> extension from <code>github.com/example/semver</code>. This is in its
<code>extension.control</code> file:</p>
  <code>name = 'semver'
package = 'github.com/example/pg-semver'
</code>  <p>The installer detects that <code>semver.name</code> already exists for a different package
and raises an error. The user could then give it a different name by running
something like:</p>
  <code>make install ALIAS_EXTENSION_NAME=semver2
</code>  <p>This would add <code>semver2.name</code> right next to <code>semver.name</code>, and its contents
would contain <code>github.com/example/semver</code>, where all of its files are installed.
This would allow <code>CREATE EXTENSION semver2</code> to load the it without issue
(assuming no object conflicts, hopefully resolved by relocate-ability).</p>
<p>I realize a lot of extensions with libraries could wreak some havoc on the
library resolver having to search so many library directories, but perhaps
there’s some way around that as well? Curious what techniques experienced C
developers might have adopted.</p>
 Back to Decentralized Publishing 
<p>An updated installed extension file structure would be nice, and is surely worth
a discussion, but even if it shipped in Postgres 20, we need an updated
extension ecosystem today, to work well with all supported versions of Postgres.
So let’s return to the idea of decentralized publishing without such changes.</p>
<p>I can think of two pieces that’d be required to get Go-style decentralized
extension publishing to work with the current infrastructure.</p>
 Module Uniqueness 
<p>The first is to specify a new metadata field to be unique for the entire index,
and which would contain the repository path. Call it <code>module</code>, after Go (a
single Git repository can have multiple modules). In <a href="https://pgxn.org/spec/" title="PGXN Meta Spec - The PGXN distribution metadata specification">PGXN Meta Spec</a>-style JSON
it’d look something like this:</p>
  <code>{
    "module": "github.com/theory/pg-semver",
    "version": "0.32.1",
    "provides": {
      "semver": {
         "abstract": "A semantic version data type",
      }
    }
}
</code>  <p>Switch from the PGXN-style uniqueness on the distribution name (usually the name
of the extension) and let the module be globally unique. This would allow
another party to release an extension with the same name. Even a fork where only
the <code>module</code> is changed:</p>
  <code>{
    "module": "github.com/example/pg-semver",
    "version": "0.32.1",
    "provides": {
      "semver": {
         "abstract": "A semantic version data type",
      }
    }
}
</code>  <p>Both would be indexed and appear under the module name, and both would be
find-able by the provided extension name, <code>semver</code>.</p>
<p>Where that name must still be unique is in a given install. In other words,
while <code>github.com/theory/pg-semver</code> and <code>github.com/example/pg-semver</code> both
exist in the index, the <code>semver</code> extension can be installed from only one of
them in a given Postgres system, where the extension name <code>semver</code> defines its
uniqueness.</p>
<p>This pattern would allow for much more duplication of ideas while preserving the
existing per-cluster namespacing. It also allows for a future Postgres release
that supports something like the flexible per-cluster packaging as described
above.<a>2</a></p>
 Extension Toolchain App 
<p>The second piece is an extension management application that understands all
this stuff and makes it possible. It would empower both extension development
workflows — including testing, metadata management, and releasing — and
extension user workflows — finding, downloading, building, and installing.</p>
<p>Stealing from Go, imagine a developer making a release with something like this:</p>
  <code>git tag v1.2.1 -sm 'Tag v1.2.1'
git push --tags
pgmod list -m github.com/theory/pg-semver@v1.2.1
</code>  <p>The creatively named <code>pgmod</code> tells the registry to index the new version
directly from its Git repository. Thereafter anyone can find it and install it
with:</p>
 
 <code>pgmod get github.com/theory/pg-semver@v1.2.1</code> — installs the specified version 
 <code>pgmod get github.com/theory/pg-semver</code> — installs the latest version 
 <code>pgmod get semver</code> — installs the latest version or shows a list of
matching modules to select from 
 
<p>Any of these would fail if the cluster already has an extension named <code>semver</code>
with a different module name. But with something like the updated extension
installation locations in a future version of Postgres, that limitation could be
loosened.</p>
 Challenges 
<p>Every new idea comes with challenges, and this little thought experiment is no
exception. Some that immediately occur to me:</p>
 
 Not every extension can be installed directly from its repository. Perhaps
the metadata could include a download link for a tarball with the results of
any pre-release execution? 
 Adoption of a new CLI could be tricky. It would be useful to include the
functionality in existing tools people already use, like <a href="https://github.com/pgcentralfoundation/pgrx" title="pgrx is a framework for developing PostgreSQL extensions in Rust and strives to be as idiomatic and safe as possible">pgrx</a>. 
 Updating the uniqueness constraint in existing systems like <a href="https://pgxn.org" title="PGXN — PostgreSQL Extension Network">PGXN</a> might be
a challenge. Most record the repository info in the <a href="https://pgxn.org/spec/#resources">resources META.json
object</a>, so it would be do-able to adapt into a new META format, either
on <a href="https://pgxn.org" title="PGXN — PostgreSQL Extension Network">PGXN</a> itself or in a new registry, should we choose to build one. 
 Getting everyone to standardize on standardized versioning tags might take
some effort. Go had the benefit of controlling its entire toolchain, while
Postgres extension versioning and release management has been all over the
place. However <a href="https://pgxn.org" title="PGXN — PostgreSQL Extension Network">PGXN</a> long ago standardized on <a href="https://semver.org" title="Semantic Versioning 2.0.0">semantic versioning</a> and
those who have released extensions on PGXN have had few issues (one can
still use other version formats in the control file, for better or worse). 
 Some PGXN distributions have shipped different versions of extensions in a
single release, or the same version as in other releases. The release
version of the overall package (repository, really) would have to become
canonical. 
 
<p>I’m sure there are more, I just thought of these offhand. What have you thought
of? Post ’em if you got ’em   in the <a href="https://postgresteam.slack.com/archives/C056ZA93H1A" title="Postgres Slack/#extensions: Extensions and extension-related accessories">#extensions</a> channel on the <a href="https://pgtreats.info/slack-invite" title="Join the Postgres Slack">Postgres

<p>Or does it? Yes, it does. Although the Go CLI downloads most
public modules from a <a href="https://go.dev/ref/mod#goproxy-protocol" title="Go Modules Reference: GOPROXY protocol">module proxy server</a> like <code>proxy.golang.org</code>, it
still must know how to <a href="https://go.dev/ref/mod#vcs" title="Go Modules Reference: Version control systems">download modules from a version control system</a> when
a proxy is not available.&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a></p>
 
 
<p>Assuming, of course, that if and when the Postgres core
adopts more bundled packaging that they’d use the same naming convention as
we have in the broader ecosystem. Not a perfectly safe assumption, but given
the Go precedent and wide adoption of host/path-based projects, it seems
sound.&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a></p>

<p>Over on the <a href="https://blog.pgxn.org/">PGXN Blog</a> I’ve <a href="https://blog.pgxn.org/post/741049567045468160/pgxn-tools-v4" title="PGXN Blog: “PGXN Tools Docker Image Updated”">posted a brief update</a> on recent bug fixes and
improvements to the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/pgxn/pgxn-tools">pgxn-tools Docker image</a>, which is used fairly widely these
days to test, bundle, and release Postgres extensions to <a href="https://pgxn.org" title="PostgreSQL Extension Network">PGXN</a>. This fix is
especially important for Git repositories:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>v1.4.1 fixes an issue where <code>git archive</code> was never actually used to build a
release zip archive. This changed at some point without noticing due to the
introduction of the <code>safe.directory</code> configuration in recent versions of Git.
Inside the container the directory was never trusted, and the <code>pgxn-bundle</code>
command caught the error, decided it wasn’t working with a Git repository, and
used the <code>zip</code> command, instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I also posted a <a href="https://gist.github.com/theory/93c93571200aad02e93170c6d2c93cbe" title="PGXN distributions that contain a .git directory">gist listing PGXN distributions with a <code>.git</code> directory</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>
Ideally, tools like GeoGebra and Metabase provide interfaces so intuitive that you rarely need to read the docs, and you can learn the software just by poking around in it. In reality, of course, we need those docs — and they still need to be excellent. But now, we’ll extract a new benefit from them. When we can partner with machines that have read the docs, and can look over our shoulders as we try to do the things described in the docs, we’ll turbocharge our ability to dive into unfamiliar software tools and quickly learn how to use them.
