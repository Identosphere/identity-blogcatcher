However, evidence gathering and presentation have similar issues. &nbsp; Evidence can always be found to support the outcome you want (is this a problem or not), and incentives mean that evidence about which solution creates the best outcome will be lost, reframed and distorted.&nbsp;</p> Unpicking these two sides and many faces of evidence is a Day 0 challenge for all CDO’s.&nbsp; <p>In previous articles, I have written about many aspects of this problem.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo/the-railroad-of-no-choice-a55420cea06f">Do I start to unpack this is a problem and challenge it?</a></p><p><a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo/dashboards-friend-or-foe-da3286ef01f9">Do I unpack this recommended solution as evidence is biased</a></p><p><a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo/day-0-as-the-cdo-you-are-now-the-new-corporate-punch-bag-1cddc7713c87">Do I want to be the new corporate punch bag?</a></p><p><a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo/do-our-tools-mould-our-outcomes-and-decisions-75519838dadb">Do I leave the past to be the past and only focus on the new, knowing the past will influence the future</a>?</p><p>How do I raise the evidence bar knowing that <a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo/being-curious-will-not-kill-the-cdo-c7b30446add5">facts and science will not help bring the team together</a>?</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo/core-responsibilities-of-a-chief-data-officer-cdo-835528f13b78">Do I want to add a new CORE responsibility to an already packed list?</a></p><p><a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo/for-what-are-we-optimising-1d54c94c0487">Are we sure what we are optimising for?</a></p><p><a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo/day-0-cdo-language-the-translator-interpreter-and-go-between-b6582327616c">Have I got the time to act as the translator and interrupter?</a></p> The core to evidence is knowing.&nbsp; <p>How to know that what you know is true is epistemology. Epistemology doesn’t just ask questions about what we should do to find things out; that is the task of all disciplines to some extent. For example, science, research, data analysis, and anthropology all have their own methods for finding things out. Epistemology has the job of making those methods themselves the objects of study. It aims to understand how methods of inquiry can be seen as rational endeavours.</p><p>If the concept of “knowing things to be true” were simple, we’d all agree on many things that we currently disagree about; climate and vaccines appear current.&nbsp; We cannot reach a unanimous agreement means something is wrong with our data, analysis, and information model.</p><p>The senior leadership team will tend to think of themselves as clear thinkers and see those who disagree with an opinion as misguided. Executives believe they have the capacity to see things just as they “really” are and that it is others who have confused perceptions. As a result, the CDO can simply point out to everyone where their thinking has gone wrong using facts rather than engage in rational dialogue allowing for the possibility that we all might be wrong. Philosophy, psychology and cognitive science guide us that we are complex, and our reasoning is not clinical or pure. Data (facts) and its analysis create a staggeringly complex array of cognitive biases and dispositions. We are generally ignorant of their role in others who influence us and our own thinking and decision-making.</p><p>A CDO is responsible for introducing everyone who touches data to a systematic way of interrogating thinking, models, rationality, and a sense of what makes “for a good reason” for both sides of the evidence coin.&nbsp;</p><p>As a CDO, you should help determine by what criteria the leadership team are to evaluate reason.&nbsp; We need to establish how, as a team, the criteria themselves are evaluated? Further, how do we determine how a belief or action can be justified and the relationship between justification and truth? &nbsp; And as the CDO, we have to establish and own the <a href="https://opengovernance.net/data-for-better-decisions-nature-or-nurture-79e6531dbe3a">company-wide top-level data ontology</a>.&nbsp;</p><p></p><br><p>The first action will be to get the topic of evidence on the agenda, not as a diversion, but to start to bring up critical issues such as bias in our decision making.&nbsp;</p><br><br><p>----</p><p>Whilst our ongoing agile iteration into <a href="https://opengovernance.net/what-occurs-when-physical-beings-transition-to-information-beings-146ea9dcbca3">information beings</a> is never-ending, there are the first 100 days in the new role. But what to focus on? Well, that rose-tinted period of conflicting priorities is what <a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo/">&lt;/Hello, CDO!&gt;</a> is all about. Maintaining sanity when all else has been lost to untested data assumptions is a different problem entirely.</p> <br>

<p>On Quora, here’s <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-worst-design-trends-in-modern-cars/answer/Doc-Searls">my answer</a> to <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-worst-design-trends-in-modern-cars">What are the worst design trends in modern cars?</a>—updated by our family’s experience with a new Toyota that features even more indicators than the bunch above::::</p>
<p>Based on driving&nbsp;lots&nbsp;of late-model rental cars, here’s a list:</p>
 
 Entertainment systems that are hard to use and dangerous on the road. (Few are good. Most are bad. Some are truly awful.) 
 Making AM and FM listening harder than ever. Some of this is by putting too many functions in too many menus you have to poke at. (While driving, knobs and switches beat buttons for usability. Ask a pilot.) Some of it is by burying antennas in windows, which will never work as well as a whip antenna (preferably the retractable kind that can survive a car wash). But a thumbs-up to cars offering HD Radio, which adds many more stations to FM and far better sound to AM (on the sadly too few stations that feature it). 
 Way too much optionality among features with non-obvious meanings that you control through buttons with whaaa? symbols or half-buried menus that can be as dangerous to navigate while driving as it is to finger-text on one’s cell phone. For example, a loaded 2021 Toyota Camry Hybrid has TSS w/PD, HUD, DRCC, LDA w/SA, LTA, AHB, PCS, RCD, RSA, BSM. RCTA, RCTB, VSC, EV, ECO, plus other stuff that’s a bit more spelled out, such as TRAC, Qi Wireless Charger and Birds Eye View Camera. And those are in addition to the usual indicators: shifter position, odometer, outside temperature, etc. Many of these unclear functions are displayed only or mainly in the “Meters/Multi-Information Display” you view through or over your steering wheel. Since there is no way the display can give you a full view of all these functions in all their possible states, you move around your selections and menus through buttons on the steering wheel that you mash with your left thumb. And that’s just one model of one car. (Which we happen to almost have: ours is a 2020 model.) 
 Poor visibility out the back corners, thanks to extra-wide roof pillars and fake-muscle styling that narrows the shapes of the cars’ aft windows. 
 No place to mount a phone. I mean, why have Apple’s CarPlay and/or Android Auto and&nbsp;not&nbsp;have a place to mount a phone? (Yes, there are aftermarket things with suction cups, but most new cars lack a surface other than the windshield that will hold a cup sucked.) 
 Trunks with plenty of space but too small an opening, so it’s hard to get large or odd-shaped items in there. 
 Low-profile and performance tires, which handle nicely but can ride rough and transmit lots of road noise. 
 Too much black. On the dashboard platform under windshields, black makes sense because you don’t want a light color reflecting off the windshield. But black is used way too much in trim. Worse, black steering wheels parked in the sun can get too hot to hold. And black leather or vinyl seats can fry your ass. 
 Giant grills—especially ones that resemble <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=mouth+of+manta+ray">the mouths of manta rays</a>. (I’m <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=lexus+grille+manta+ray">looking at you</a>, Lexus.) 
 
<p>I think comments work here now, so if you have any additions or subtractions, bring ’em on.</p>

<p>Some news: I’m super happy to report that I started a new job last week at <a href="https://nytimes.com/">The
New York Times</a>.</p>
<p>After ten years at <a href="https://iovation.com/">iovation</a>, the last four working remotely from New York City
and the last three under the ownership of <a href="https://transunion.com/">TransUnion</a>, I felt it was time to
find something new. At The Times, I’ve taken the role of Staff Engineer on a new
team, User Systems. I’m particularly stoked for this gig, as it falls right into
areas of abiding interest, including privacy-by design, personal data
protection, encryption, authentication, credential management, and scaling a
vital app for the whole business. Add that to the straightforward commute once
the office reopens, and it’s hard to find something more ideal.</p>
<p>I truly appreciate the extraordinary experience of my ten years at iovation. I
originally thought I’d stay a couple years, but was so engaged by the people and
the great work we did that I kept at it. I learned a ton about product
engineering, product design, and scalable architectures, but especially about
working with terrific colleagues who made me a better person even as I tried to
be of service to them. I will especially miss working with Scott, Kurk, Clara,
Travis, John, and Eric — and countless others. I wish them all the best, and
would enjoy working with any and all of them again anytime.</p>
<p>Now I’m excited to make new connections working with my amazing new colleagues
at The Times. I expect we’ll collaborate on fulfilling work building super
useful tools that advance <a href="https://www.nytco.com/company/mission-and-values/" title="The New York Times Company: Mission and Values">The Times mission</a> to inform and empower its readers.
I’m delighted to be jumping on this ride with them.</p>

<p>Sometimes Angular applications are required to authenticate against multiple identity providers. This blog post shows how to implement an Angular SPA which authenticates using <a href="https://auth0.com/">Auth0</a> for one identity provider and also IdentityServer4 from <a href="https://duendesoftware.com/">Duende</a> software as the second. The SPA can logout from both of the identity providers individually and also revoke the refresh token used to renew the session using the revocation endpoint. The endsession endpoint is used to logout. IdentityServer4 also supports introspection so that it is possible to revoke reference tokens on a logout as well as the refresh token. The Angular application uses OpenID Connect code flow with PKCE implemented using the npm <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/angular-auth-oidc-client">angular-auth-oidc-client</a> library.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/angular-auth-oidc-client/tree/main/projects/sample-code-flow-multi-Auth0-ID4">https://github.com/damienbod/angular-auth-oidc-client/tree/main/projects/sample-code-flow-multi-Auth0-ID4</a></p>



<p>The  <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/angular-auth-oidc-client">angular-auth-oidc-client</a> npm package can be added to the application in the App.Module class. We used an AuthConfigModule module to configure the settings and can keep the AppModule small.</p>


  import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { RouterModule } from '@angular/router';
import { AppComponent } from './app.component';
import { AuthConfigModule } from './auth-config.module';
import { HomeComponent } from './home/home.component';
import { UnauthorizedComponent } from './unauthorized/unauthorized.component';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent, HomeComponent, UnauthorizedComponent],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    RouterModule.forRoot([
      { path: '', redirectTo: 'home', pathMatch: 'full' },
      { path: 'home', component: HomeComponent },
      { path: 'forbidden', component: UnauthorizedComponent },
      { path: 'unauthorized', component: UnauthorizedComponent },
    ]),
    AuthConfigModule,
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent],
})
export class AppModule {}

  


<p>The  AuthConfigModule  configures the two identity providers. Both clients are step up to use the Open ID Connect code flow with PKCE (proof key for code exchange). Each secure token server (STS) has it’s specifics configurations which are required to use this flow. These configurations must match the corresponding client configuration on the token service of the identity provider. All identity providers have their own flavour of the Open ID Connect specification and also support different features.  Some of these are worse, some are better. When implementing SPA applications, you should validate the required features supported by the identity provider.</p>


  import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { AuthModule, LogLevel } from 'angular-auth-oidc-client';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    AuthModule.forRoot({
      config: [
        {
          authority: 'https://offeringsolutions-sts.azurewebsites.net',
          redirectUrl: window.location.origin,
          postLogoutRedirectUri: window.location.origin,
          clientId: 'angularCodeRefreshTokens',
          scope: 'openid profile email taler_api offline_access',
          responseType: 'code',
          silentRenew: true,
          useRefreshToken: true,
          logLevel: LogLevel.Debug,
        },
        {
          authority: 'https://dev-damienbod.eu.auth0.com',
          redirectUrl: window.location.origin,
          postLogoutRedirectUri: window.location.origin,
          clientId: 'Ujh5oSBAFr1BuilgkZPcMWEgnuREgrwU',
          scope: 'openid profile offline_access auth0-user-api-spa',
          responseType: 'code',
          silentRenew: true,
          useRefreshToken: true,
          logLevel: LogLevel.Debug,
          customParamsAuthRequest: {
            audience: 'https://auth0-api-spa',
          },
        },
      ],
    }),
  ],
  exports: [AuthModule],
})
export class AuthConfigModule {}
  


<p>The checkAuthMultiple function is used to initialize the authentication state and begin the flows or whatever. An SPA application requires some route when this logic can run before the guards execute. This is not a server rendered application where the security runs in the trusted backend. The initializing logic setups the state and handles callbacks form the different authentication flows. Great care should be taken when using guards. If a guard is applied to the default route, you need to ensure that the initialization logic runs first. The checkAuthMultiple  function should only be called once in the application.</p>


  import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { OidcSecurityService } from 'angular-auth-oidc-client';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: 'app.component.html',
})
export class AppComponent implements OnInit {
  constructor(public oidcSecurityService: OidcSecurityService) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    this.oidcSecurityService.checkAuthMultiple().subscribe(([{ isAuthenticated, userData, accessToken }]) =&gt; {
      console.log('Authenticated', isAuthenticated);
    });
  }
}
  


<p>The sign-in logout, revoke tokens can then be implemented anywhere for the different identity providers. Each client configuration has its own configuration ID which can be used to run or start the required authentication flow, logout or whatever.</p>


  import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import {
  AuthenticatedResult,
  OidcClientNotification,
  OidcSecurityService,
  OpenIdConfiguration,
  UserDataResult,
} from 'angular-auth-oidc-client';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-home',
  templateUrl: 'home.component.html',
})
export class HomeComponent implements OnInit {
  configurations: OpenIdConfiguration[];
  userDataChanged$: Observable&lt;OidcClientNotification&lt;any&gt;&gt;;
  userData$: Observable&lt;UserDataResult&gt;;
  isAuthenticated$: Observable&lt;AuthenticatedResult&gt;;

  constructor(public oidcSecurityService: OidcSecurityService) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    this.configurations = this.oidcSecurityService.getConfigurations();
    this.userData$ = this.oidcSecurityService.userData$;
    this.isAuthenticated$ = this.oidcSecurityService.isAuthenticated$;
  }

  login(configId: string) {
    this.oidcSecurityService.authorize(configId);
  }

  forceRefreshSession() {
    this.oidcSecurityService.forceRefreshSession().subscribe((result) =&gt; console.warn(result));
  }

  logout(configId: string) {
    this.oidcSecurityService.logoff(configId);
  }

  refreshSessionId4(configId: string) {
    this.oidcSecurityService.forceRefreshSession(null, configId).subscribe((result) =&gt; console.log(result));
  }

  refreshSessionAuth0(configId: string) {
    this.oidcSecurityService
      .forceRefreshSession({ scope: 'openid profile offline_access auth0-user-api-spa' }, configId)
      .subscribe((result) =&gt; console.log(result));
  }

  logoffAndRevokeTokens(configId: string) {
    this.oidcSecurityService.logoffAndRevokeTokens(configId).subscribe((result) =&gt; console.log(result));
  }

  revokeRefreshToken(configId: string) {
    this.oidcSecurityService.revokeRefreshToken(null, configId).subscribe((result) =&gt; console.log(result));
  }
}

  


<p>The application can be run and you can logout or use the required configuration. Underneath the identity has not signed in with IdentityServer and the Auth0 client has be authenticated. Each identity provider is independent from the other. </p>







<p>The multiple identity provider support is implemented using redirects. You could also implement all of this using popups depending on you use cases.</p>

<p>Labels like “data scientist” and “data journalist” connote an elite corps of professionals who can analyze data and use it to reason about the world. There are elite practitioners, of course, but since the advent of online data a quarter century ago I’ve hoped that every thinking citizen of the world (and of the web) could engage in similar analysis and reasoning. </p>
<p>That’s long been possible for those of us with the ability to wrangle APIs and transform data using SQL, Python, or another programming language. But even for us it hasn’t been easy. When I read news stories that relate to the generation of electric power in California, for example, questions occur to me that I know I could illuminate by finding, transforming, and charting sources of web data:</p>
<p>– How can I visualize the impact of shutting down California’s last nuclear plant?</p>
<p>– What’s the relationship between drought and hydro power?</p>
<p>All the ingredients are lying around in plain sight, but the effort required to combine them winds up being more trouble than it’s worth. And that’s for me, a skilled longtime scraper and transformer of web data. For you — even if you’re a scientist or a journalist! — that may not even be an option.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://workbenchdata.com/">Workbench</a>, a web app with the tagline: “Scrape, clean, combine and analyze data without code.” I’ve worked with tools in the past that pointed the way toward that vision. DabbleDB in 2005 (now gone) and Freebase Gridworks in 2010 (still alive as Open Refine) were effective ways to cut through <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2008/02/20/overcoming-data-friction/">data friction</a>. Workbench carries those ideas forward delightfully. It enables me to fly through the boring and difficult stuff — the scraping, cleaning, and combining — in order to focus on what matters: the analysis.</p>
<p>Here’s the <a href="https://app.workbenchdata.com/workflows/149325/report">report</a> that I made to address the questions I posed above. It’s based on a <a href="https://app.workbenchdata.com/workflows/149325/">workflow</a> that you can visit and explore as I describe it here. (If you create your own account you can clone and modify.)</p>
<p>The workflow contains a set of tabs; each tab contains a sequence of steps; each step transforms a data set and displays output as a table or chart. When you load the page the first tab runs, and the result of its last step is displayed. In this case that’s the first chart shown in the report:</p>
<p></p>
<p>As in a Jupyter notebook you can run each step individually. Try clicking step 1. You’ll see a table of data from <a href="https://www.energy.ca.gov/data-reports/energy-almanac/california-electricity-data/electric-generation-capacity-and-energy">energy.ca.gov</a>. Notice that step 1 is labeled Concatenate tabs. If you unfurl it you’ll see that it uses another tab, 2001-2020 scraped, which in turn concatenates two other tabs, 2001-2010 scraped and 2011-2020 scraped. Note that I’ve helpfully explained that in the optional comment field above step 1.</p>
<p>Each of the two source tabs scrapes a table from the page at energy.ca.gov. As I note in the report, it wasn’t necessary to scrape those tables since the data are available as an Excel file that can be downloaded, then uploaded to Workbench (as I’ve done in the tab named energy.ca.gov xslx). I scraped them anyway because that web page presents a common challenge: the data appear in two separate HTML tables. That’s helpful to the reader but frustrating to an analyst who wants to use the data. Rapid and fluid combination of scraped tables is grease for cutting through data friction; Workbench supplies that grease.</p>
<p>Now click step 2 in the first tab. It’s the last step, so you’re back to the opening display of the chart. Unfurl it and you’ll see the subset of columns included in the chart. I’ve removed some minor sources, like oil and waste heat, in order to focus on major ones. Several details are notable here. First: colors. The system provides a default palette but you can adjust it. Black wasn’t on the default palette but I chose that for coal.</p>
<p>Second, grand total. The data set doesn’t include that column, and it’s not something I needed here. But in some situations I’d want it, so the system offers it as a choice. That’s an example of the attention to detail that pervades every aspect of Workbench. </p>
<p>Third, Vega. See the triple-dot button above the legend in the chart? Click it, then select Open in Vega Editor, and when you get there, click Run. Today I learned that Vega is:</p>
<blockquote><p>
a declarative format for creating, saving, and sharing visualization designs. With Vega, visualizations are described in JSON, and generate interactive views using either HTML5 Canvas or SVG.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Sweet! I think I’ll use it in my own work to simplify what I’ve recently (and painfully) learned how to do with D3.js. It’s also a nice example of how Workbench prioritizes openness, reusability, and reproducibility in every imaginable way.</p>
<p>I use the chart as the intro to my report, which is made with an elegant block editor in which you can combine tables and charts from any of your tabs with snippets of text written in markdown. There I begin to ask myself questions, adding tabs to marshal supporting evidence and sourcing evidence from tabs into the report.</p>
<p>My first question is about the contribution that the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant has been making to the overall mix. In the 2020 percentages all major sources tab I start in step 1 by reusing the tab 2001-2020 scraped. Step 2 filters the columns to just the same set of major sources shown in the chart. I could instead apply that step in 2001-2020 scraped and avoid the need to select columns for the chart. Since I’m not sure how that decision might affect downstream analysis I keep all the columns. If I change my mind it’s easy to push the column selection upstream. </p>
<p>Workbench not only makes it possible to refactor a workflow, it practically begs you to do that. When things go awry, as they inevitably will, it’s no problem. You can undo and redo the steps in each tab! You won’t see that in the read-only view but if you create your own account, and duplicate my workflow in it, give it a try. With stepwise undo/redo, exploratory analysis becomes a safe and stress-free activity.</p>
<p>At step 2 of 2020 percentages all major sources we have rows for all the years. In thinking about Diablo Canyon’s contribution I want to focus on a single reference year so in step 3 I apply a filter that selects just the 2020 row. Here’s the UX for that.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In situations like this, where you need to select one or more items from a list, Workbench does all the right things to minimize tedium: search if needed, start from all or none depending on which will be easier, then keep or remove selected items, again depending on which will be easier. </p>
<p>In step 4 I include an alternate way to select just the 2020 row. It’s a Select SQL step that says select * from input where Year = '2020'. That doesn’t change anything here; I could omit either step 3 or step 4 without affecting the outcome; I include step 4 just to show that SQL is available at any point to transform the output of a prior step. </p>
<p>Which is fantastic, but wait, there’s more. In step 5 I use a Python step to do the same thing in terms of a pandas dataframe. Again this doesn’t affect the outcome, I’m just showing that Python is available at any point to transform the output of a prior step. Providing equivalent methods for novices and experts, in a common interface, is extraordinarily powerful.</p>
<p>I’m noticing now, by the way, that step 5 doesn’t work if you’re not logged in. So I’ll show it to you here:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Step 6 transposes the table so we can reason about the fuel types. In steps 3-5 they’re columns, in step 6 they become rows. This is a commonly-needed maneuver. And while I might use the SQL in step 4 to do the row selection handled by the widget in step 3, I won’t easily accomplish the transposition that way. The Transpose step is one of the most powerful tools in the kit.</p>
<p>Notice at step 6 that the first column is named Year. That’s a common outcome of transposition and here necessitates step 7 in which I rename it to Fuel Type. There are two ways to do that. You can click the + Add Step button, choose the Rename columns option, drag the new step into position 7, open it, and do the renaming there. </p>
<p>But look:</p>
<p></p>
<p>You can edit anything in a displayed table. When I change Year to Fuel Type that way, the same step 7 that you can create manually appears automatically. </p>
<p></p>
<p>It’s absolutely brilliant.</p>
<p>In step 8 I use the Calculate step to add a new column showing each row’s percentage of the column sum. In SQL I’d have to think about that a bit. Here, as is true for so many routine operations like this, Workbench offers the solution directly: </p>
<p></p>
<p>Finally in step 9 I sort the table. The report includes it, and there I consider the question of Diablo Canyon’s contribution. According to my analysis nuclear power was 9% of the major sources I’ve selected, contributing 16,280 GWh in 2020. According to another energy.ca.gov page that I <a href="https://www.energy.ca.gov/sites/default/files/2020-03/Nuclear_Power_Reactors_in_California_ada.pdf">cite</a> in the report, Diablo Canyon is the only remaining nuke plant in the state, producing “about 18,000 GWh.” That’s not an exact match but it’s close enough to give me confidence that reasoning about the nuclear row in the table applies to Diablo Canyon specifically. </p>
<p>Next I want to compare nuclear power to just the subset of sources that are renewable. That happens in the 2020 percentages renewable tab, the output of which is also included in the report. Step 1 begins with the output of 2020 percentages of all major sources. In step 2 I clarify that the 2020 column is really 2020 GWh. In step 3 I remove the percent column in order to recalculate it. In step 4 I remove rows in order to focus on just nuclear and renewables. In step 5 I recalculate the percentages. And in step 6 I make the chart that also flows through to the report.</p>
<p>Now, as I look at the chart, I notice that the line for large hydro is highly variable and appears to correlate with drought years. In order to explore that correlation I look for data on reservoir levels and arrive at <a href="https://cdec.water.ca.gov/">https://cdec.water.ca.gov/</a>. I’d love to find a table that aggregates levels for all reservoirs statewide since 2001, but that doesn’t seem to be on offer. So I decide to use Lake Mendocino as a proxy. In step 1 I scrape an <a href="https://cdec.water.ca.gov/dynamicapp/QueryWY?Stations=MNC&amp;SensorNums=15&amp;End=2021-07-31&amp;span=20">HTML table</a> with monthly levels for the lake since 2001. In step 2 I delete the first row which only has some months. In step 3 I rename the first column to Year in order to match what’s  in the table I want to join with. In step 4 I convert the types of the month columns from text to numeric to enable calculation. In step 5 I calculate the average into a new column, Avg. In step 6 I select just Year and Avg. </p>
<p>When I first try the join in step 8 it fails for a common reason that Workbench helpfully explains:</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the other table Year looks like ‘2001’, but the text scraped from energy.ca.gov looks like ‘2,001’. That’s a common glitch that can bring an exercise like this to a screeching halt. There’s probably a Workbench way to do this, but in step 7 I use SQL to reformat the values in the Year column, removing the commas  to enable the join. While there I also rename the Avg column to Lake Mendocino Avg Level. Now in tab 8 I can do the join.</p>
<p>In tab 9 I scale the values for Large Hydro into a new column, Scaled Large Hydro. Why? The chart I want to see will compare power generation in GWh (gigawatt hours) and lake levels in AF (acre-feet). These aren’t remotely compatible but I don’t care, I’m just looking for comparable trends. Doubling the value for Large Hydro gets close enough for the comparison chart in step 10, which also flows through to the report.</p>
<p>All this adds up to an astonishingly broad, deep, and rich set of features. And I haven’t even talked about the <a href="http://help.workbenchdata.com/en/articles/2322465-clean-text">Clean text</a> step for tweaking whitespace, capitalization, and punctuation, or the <a href="http://help.workbenchdata.com/en/articles/1867388-refine">Refine</a> step for finding and merging clusters of similar values that refer to the same things. Workbench is also simply beautiful as you can see from the screen shots here, or by visiting my workflow. When I reviewed software products for BYTE and InfoWorld it was rare to encounter one that impressed me so thoroughly.</p>
<p>But wait, there’s more. </p>
<p>At the core of my workflow there’s a set of tabs; each is a sequence of steps; some of these produce tables and charts. Wrapped around the workflow there’s the report into which I cherrypick tables and charts for the story I’m telling there. </p>
<p>There’s also another kind of wrapper: a lesson wrapped around the workflow. I could write a lesson that guides you through the steps I’ve described and checks that each yields the expected result. See <a href="https://app.workbenchdata.com/courses/en/intro-to-data-journalism/first-story">Intro to data journalism</a> for an example you can try. Again, it’s brilliantly well done.</p>
<p>So Workbench succeeds in three major ways. If you’re not a data-oriented professional, but you’re a thinking person who wants to use available web data to reason about the world, Workbench will help you power through the grunt work of scraping, cleaning, and combining that data so you can focus on analysis. If you aspire to become such a professional, and you don’t have a clue about how to do that grunt work, it will help you learn the ropes. And if you are one of the pros you’ll still find it incredibly useful.</p>
<p>Kudos to the Workbench team, and especially to core developers Jonathan Stray, Pierre Conti, and Adam Hooper, for making this spectacularly great software tool. </p>

 I also published an article describing the Baked Data architectural patttern and shared the video and transcript of a talk I gave at PyGotham last year.

  <p>I mentioned Project Pelican (still a codename until the end of the embargo) <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Jul/21/weeknotes/">last week</a>. This week it inspired a new plugin, <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-remote-metadata">datasette-remote-metadata</a>.</p>
<p>I also published an article describing <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Jul/28/baked-data/">the Baked Data architectural patttern</a> and shared <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Jul/22/small-data/">the video and transcript</a> of a talk I gave at PyGotham last year.</p>
 datasette-remote-metadata 
<p>Datasette's <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/metadata.html">metadata system</a> is one of the key ways of customizing a Datasette instance: it lets you add extra information about the tables hosted by the instance, lets you configure <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/sql_queries.html#canned-queries">canned queries</a> and also (due to some scope creep that <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/493">I'd love to clean up</a>) lets you configure options for various Datasette plugins.</p>
<p>There's just one catch: when you update the metadata for an instance, you need to re-deploy the whole thing. I increasingly find myself using Datasette and Cloud Run to host databases that are over 1GB in size, so re-deploying just to tweak some text on the homepage is less than ideal.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-remote-metadata">datasette-remote-metadata</a> plugin uses the new <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/plugin_hooks.html#get-metadata-datasette-key-database-table">get_metadata() plugin hook</a> from Datasette 0.58 to work around this problem.</p>
<p>Essentially, it lets you tell Datasette "load your metadata from this external URL". You provide it with a URL to a JSON or YAML file hosted elsewhere and the plugin will load that file on startup and periodically (by default every 30 seconds) check to see if it has changed.</p>
<p>Those checks for updates only happen if Datasette is receiving traffic. Datasette will try for up to 200ms, then continue the fetch but serve the request using the now-stale metadata rather than block for longer than that.</p>
<p>I'm trying this out for Project Pelican and it seems to be working great - which means we can iterate on the metadata (including the <code>description_html</code> block displayed on the Datasette homepage) without needing to constantly re-deploy the 700+ MB SQLite database file to Cloud Run.</p>
 sqlite-transform --multi 
<p><a href="https://datasette.io/tools/sqlite-transform">sqlite-transform</a> is my command-line tool for running transformations against columns of data in a SQLite database - parsing dates, splitting comma-separated lists into JSON arrays or using custom Python code to apply any custom transformation.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-transform/releases/tag/1.2">latest release</a> adds support for splitting one input column into multiple output columns. This is best explained with an example: consider a database table with a <code>location</code> column that contains <code>latitude,longitude</code> points which you would like to split out into separate <code>latitude</code> and <code>longitude</code> columns.</p>
 <code>sqlite-transform lambda demo.db places location \
  --code 'return {
    "latitude": float(value.split(",")[0]),
    "longitude": float(value.split(",")[1]),
  }' --multi --drop
</code> 
<p>The new <code>--multi</code> option means that the passed in <code>--code</code> will return a Python dictionary, and the tool should then add new columns to the specified table for each of the returned dictionary keys and populate them with the corresponding values.</p>
<p>The new <code>--drop</code> option tells the tool to drop that <code>location</code> column after the transformation has been completed.</p>

 Reflecting on change and community in a time of personal transition. Staring out over a world of possibilities (Joshua Tree, July&nbsp;2021)<p>Navigating through this global pandemic has leveled up both my tolerance for ambiguity and my appreciation for community — including friends, family, co-workers, and global colleagues. These dual forces of change and connection are also guiding me forward as I embark on a new professional chapter.</p><p>After three deeply rewarding and challenging years with <a href="http://transmute.industries">Transmute</a>, I’m transitioning into a new role this&nbsp;fall.</p><p>I will continue to work in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2021/CRD-did-core-20210724/">decentralized identity</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">verifiable credentials</a> ecosystem but will return to more of my impact roots as Senior Director of Product with Kiva’s <a href="https://www.kiva.org/protocol">Protocol</a> team — part of an <a href="http://kiva.org">international non-profit</a> working on digital identity as an enabler of deeper financial inclusion. I will also remain a champion and alumni advisor of Transmute, cheering the team on through next iterations of company and product development.</p><p>Making any big transition like this always surfaces the forest through the trees for me, bringing some longer term trends into focus in a way I often miss when heads down on day to day&nbsp;work.</p><p>In particular I’ve found myself reflecting on the philosophy and practice of open versus closed networks, and my growing conviction that open networks are a key to satisfaction and success, both for individuals and for businesses.</p><p>My working definition of “open networks” boils down to a mindset and style of engagement that assumes generosity, collaboration, and expanded connections will lead to mutual benefit. This can look like contributing to global standards and open source work, being proactive with connecting people, offering support without expectation of returned favors, and celebrating colleagues as they transition organizations (something I’ve been fortunate to experience this month with Transmute).</p><p>Open network interactions are empathetic and relational rather than transactional, rooted in a belief that we can progress and grow together, creating more opportunity in the process rather than competing for something finite.</p><p>By contrast, a more closed network approach (all too often the default) sees the gain of others as a personal loss if not compensated in some way. It is a more protective mentality that discourages transparency and informal exchange. It looks like vendor lock-in, punitive non-compete agreements, and proprietary code. To be clear, some degree of this is necessary for businesses to function today — to show value for investors, protect IP, drive competitive advantage, etc. However, taken as a default state, closed networks can crush both innovation and the spirits of individuals whose interests expand beyond the bounds of any single identity or organization.</p><p>One of the things that drew me to Transmute — and more broadly to emergent technology like decentralized identities and verifiable credentials — is that the open network style is often the default culture of engagement. In fact, this approach is necessary in the face of pre-competitive table stakes like technical interoperability as well as collaborative engagement and advocacy in the broader regulatory environment. Essentially, the adoption of this technology is far bigger than any one of us, and we have to work together to build the market and adoption we want to see in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>This open, generous network ethos aligns with the future I want to be part of, both with the organizations I help build and personally as a self-actualizing and social human. Part of the “crafted self” we talk about as identity workers includes the ability to be selectively multi-dimensional beings across different settings. To me this includes the freedom to traverse organizations and even industries as our interests take us, and to carry our reputation and relationships along that journey. Viewed in this way, the interoperability and autonomy values woven into the foundations of decentralized tech become further tools that can help bring to bear an even more generous&nbsp;world.</p><p>A huge thank you to the<a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk"> Transmute Team</a> — particularly <a href="https://medium.com/@karylfowler">Karyl Fowler</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@OR13">Orie Steele</a> — for leading the way, both as technologists and founders, in making the bet that movement across systems and organizations is a win for all parties involved (be they verifiable trade documents or prior employees). It has been a pleasure to work for and with you over the past few&nbsp;years.</p><p>***</p><p>If you are interested in some of the cross-network work happening in the decentralized tech space you can also check out the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> working groups, the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop</a>, the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP Foundation</a>, and the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/svip">Department of Homeland Security Silicon Valley Innovation Program</a> (to name just a&nbsp;few!).</p>Jumping off, jumping in!

  <p>I've been exploring an architectural pattern for publishing websites over the past few years that I call the "Baked Data" pattern. It provides many of the advantages of static site generators while avoiding most of their limitations. I think it deserves to be used more widely.</p>
<p>I define the Baked Data architectural pattern as the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Baked Data: bundling a read-only copy of your data alongside the code for your application, as part of the same deployment</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most dynamic websites keep their code and data separate: the code runs on an application server, the data lives independently in some kind of external data store - something like PostgreSQL, MySQL or MongoDB.</p>
<p>With Baked Data, the data is deployed as part of the application bundle. Any time the content changes, a fresh copy of the site is deployed that includes those updates.</p>
<p>I mostly use SQLite database files for this, but plenty of other formats can work here too.</p>
<p>This works particularly well with so-called "serverless" deployment platforms - platforms that support stateless deployments and only charge for resources spent servicing incoming requests ("scale to zero").</p>
<p>Since every change to the data results in a fresh deployment this pattern doesn't work for sites that change often - but in my experience many content-oriented sites update their content at most a few times a day. Consider blogs, documentation sites, project websites - anything where content is edited by a small group of authors.</p>
 Benefits of Baked Data 
<p>Why would you want to apply this pattern? A few reasons:</p>
 
 
Inexpensive to host. Anywhere that can run application code can host a Baked Data application - there's no need to pay extra for a managed database system. Scale to zero serverless hosts such as <a href="https://cloud.google.com/run">Cloud Run</a>, <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a> or <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS Lambda</a> will charge only cents per month for low-traffic deployments. 
 
Easy to scale. Need to handle more traffic? Run more copies of your application and its bundled data. Horizontally scaling Baked Data applications is trivial. They're also a great fit to run behind a caching proxy CDN such as Cloudflare or Fastly - when you deploy a new version you can purge that entire cache. 
 
Difficult to break. Hosting server-side applications on a VPS is always disquieting because there's so much that might go wrong - the server could be compromised, or a rogue log file could cause it to run out of disk space. With Baked Data the worst that can happen is that you need to re-deploy the application - there's no risk at all of data loss, and providers that can auto-restart code can recover from errors automatically. 
 
Server-side functionality is supported. Static site generators provide many of the above benefits, but with the limitation that any dynamic functionality needs to happen in client-side JavaScript. With a Baked Data application you can execute server-side code too. 
 
Templated pages. Another improvement over static site generators: if you have 10,000 pages, a static site generator will need to generate 10,000 HTML files. With Baked Data those 10,000 pages can exist as rows in a single SQLite database file, and the pages can be generated at run-time using a server-side template. 
 
Easy to support multiple formats. Since your content is in a dynamic data store, outputting that same content in alternative formats is easy. I use Datasette plugins for this: <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-atom">datasette-atom</a> can produce an Atom feed from a SQL query, and <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-ics">datasette-ics</a> does the same thing for iCalendar feeds. 
 
Integrates well with version control. I like to keep my site content under version control. The Baked Data pattern works well with build scripts that read content from a git repository and use it to build assets that are bundled with the deployment. 
 
 How to bake your data 
<p>My initial implementations of Baked Data have all used SQLite. It's an ideal format for this kind of application: a single binary file which can store anything that can be represented as relational tables, <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/json1.html">JSON documents</a> or <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Jul/30/fun-binary-data-and-sqlite/">binary objects</a> - essentially anything at all.</p>
<p>Any format that can be read from disk by your dynamic server-side code will work too: YAML or CSV files, Berkeley DB files, or anything else that can be represented by a bucket of read-only bytes in a file on disk.</p>
<p>[I have a hunch that you could even use something like PostgreSQL, MySQL or Elasticsearch by packaging up their on-disk representations and shipping them as part of a Docker container, but I've not tried that myself yet.]</p>
<p>Once your data is available in a file, your application code can read from that file and use it to generate and return web pages.</p>
<p>You can write code that does this in any server-side language. I use Python, usually with my <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a> application server which can read from a SQLite database file and use <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/custom_templates.html">Jinja templates</a> to generate pages.</p>
<p>The final piece of the puzzle is a build and deploy script. I use GitHub Actions for this, but any CI tool will work well here. The script builds the site content into a deployable asset, then deploys that asset along with the application code to a hosting platform.</p>
 Baked Data in action: datasette.io 
<p>The most sophisticated Baked Data site I've published myself is the official website for my Datasette project, <a href="https://datasette.io/">datasette.io</a> - source code <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette.io">in this repo</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The site is deployed using Cloud Run. It's actually a heavily customized Datasette instance, using <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette.io/blob/main/templates/index.html">a custom template</a> for the homepage, <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette.io/tree/main/templates/pages">custom pages</a> for other parts of the site and the <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-template-sql">datasette-template-sql</a> plugin to execute SQL queries and display their results from those templates.</p>
<p>The site currently runs off <a href="https://datasette.io/-/databases">four database files</a>:</p>
 
 
<a href="https://datasette.io/content">content.db</a> has most of the site content. It is built inside GitHub Actions by the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette.io/blob/main/scripts/build.sh">build.sh</a> script, which does the following:
 
 Import the contents of the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette.io/blob/main/news.yaml">news.yaml</a> file into a <a href="https://datasette.io/content/news">news</a> table using <a href="https://datasette.io/tools/yaml-to-sqlite">yaml-to-sqlite</a>. 
 Import the markdown files from the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette.io/tree/main/for">for/ folder</a> (use-cases for Datasette) into the <a href="https://datasette.io/content/uses">uses</a> table using <a href="https://datasette.io/tools/markdown-to-sqlite">markdown-to-sqlite</a>. 
 Populate the <a href="https://datasette.io/content/plugin_repos">plugin_repos</a> and <a href="https://datasette.io/content/plugin_repos">tool_repos</a> single-column tables using data from more YAML files. These are used in the next step. 
 Runs the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette.io/blob/main/build_directory.py">build_directory.py</a> Python script. This uses the GitHub GraphQL API to fetch information about all of those plugin and tool repositories, including their README files and their most recent tagged <a href="https://datasette.io/content/releases">releases</a>. 
 Populates a <a href="https://datasette.io/content/stats">stats</a> table with the latest download statistics for all of the Datasette ecosystem PyPI packages. That data is imported from a <code>stats.json</code> file in my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/package-stats">simonw/package-stats</a> repository, which is itself populated by this <a href="https://github.com/simonw/package-stats/blob/main/.github/workflows/fetch_stats.yml">git scraping script</a> that runs in GitHub Actions. I also use this for my <a href="https://observablehq.com/@simonw/datasette-downloads-per-day-with-observable-plot">Datasette Downloads Observable notebook</a>. 
 
 
 
<a href="https://datasette.io/blog">blog.db</a> contains content from my blog that carries any of the <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/datasette/">datasette</a>, <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/dogsheep/">dogsheep</a> or <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/sqliteutils/">sqliteutils</a> tags.
 
 This is fetched by the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette.io/blob/main/fetch_blog_content.py">fetch_blog_content.py</a> script, which hits the paginated per-tag Atom feed for my blog content, <a href="https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog/blob/a5b53a24b00d4c95c88c8371cfc17453b0726c23/blog/views.py#L411-L421">implemented in Django here</a>. 
 
 
 
<a href="https://datasette.io/docs-index">docs-index.db</a> is a database table containing the documentation for the most recent stable Datasette release, broken up by <a href="https://datasette.io/docs-index/sections">sections</a>.
 
 This database file is downloaded from a separate site, <a href="https://stable-docs.datasette.io/">stable-docs.datasette.io</a>, which is built and deployed as <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/blob/0.58.1/.github/workflows/publish.yml#L60-L98">part of Datasette's release process</a>. 
 
 
 
<a href="https://datasette.io/dogsheep-index">dogsheep-index.db</a> is the search index that powers site search (e.g. <a href="https://datasette.io/-/beta?q=dogsheep">this search for dogsheep</a>).
 
 The search index is built by <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/dogsheep-beta">dogsheep-beta</a> using data pulled from tables in the other database files, as configured by <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette.io/blob/main/templates/dogsheep-beta.yml">this YAML file</a>. 
 
 
 
<p>The site is automatically deployed once a day by <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette.io/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml">a scheduled action</a>, and I can also manually trigger that action if I want to ensure a new software release is reflected on the homepage.</p>
 Other real-world examples of Baked Data 
<p>I'm currently running two other sites using this pattern:</p>
 
 
<a href="https://www.niche-museums.com/">Niche Museums</a> is my blog about tiny museums that I've visited. Again, it's Datasette with custom templates. Most of the content comes from this <a href="https://github.com/simonw/museums/blob/main/museums.yaml">museums.yaml</a> file, but I also run <a href="https://github.com/simonw/museums/blob/main/annotate_timestamps.py">a script</a> to figure out when each item was created or updated from the git history. 
 
<a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/">My TILs site</a> runs on <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a> and is built from my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/til">simonw/til</a> GitHub repository by <a href="https://github.com/simonw/til/blob/main/build_database.py">this build script</a> (populating <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/tils">this tils table</a>). It uses the GitHub API to convert GitHub Flavored Markdown to HTML. I'm also running <a href="https://github.com/simonw/til/blob/main/generate_screenshots.py">a script</a> that generates small screenshots of each page and stashes them in a BLOB column in SQLite in order to provide social media preview cards, see <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Sep/3/weeknotes-airtable-screenshots-dogsheep/#weeknotes-2020-09-03-social-media-cards-tils">Social media cards for my TILs</a>. 
 
<p>My favourite example of this pattern in a site that I haven't worked on myself is <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla.org</a>.</p>
<p>They started using SQLite back in 2018 in a system they call Bedrock - Paul McLanahan provides <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/meao/2018/03/28/bedrock-the-sqlitening/">a detailed description</a> of how this works.</p>
<p>Their site content lives in a ~22MB SQLite database file, which is built and uploaded to S3 and then downloaded on a regular basis to each of their application servers.</p>
<p>You can view <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/healthz-cron/">their healthcheck page</a> to see when the database was last downloaded, and grab a copy of the SQLite file yourself. It's fun to explore that using Datasette:</p>
<p></p>
 Compared to static site generators 
<p>Static site generators have exploded in popularity over the past ten years. They drive the cost of hosting a site down to almost nothing, provide excellent performance, work well with CDNs and produce sites that are extremely unlikely to break.</p>
<p>Used carefully, the Baked Data keeps most of these characteristics while still enabling server-side code execution.</p>
<p>My example sites use this in a few different ways:</p>
 
 datasette.io <a href="https://datasette.io/-/beta?q=search">provides search</a> across 1,588 different pieces of content, plus <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins?q=ics">simpler search</a> on the plugins and tools pages. 
 My TIL site also <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/tils/search?q=search">provides search</a>, as <a href="https://www.niche-museums.com/browse/search?q=bigfoot">does Niche Museums</a>. 
 All three sites provide Atom feeds that are configured using a server-side SQL query: <a href="https://datasette.io/content/feed.atom">Datasette</a>, <a href="https://www.niche-museums.com/browse/feed.atom">Niche Museums</a>, <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/tils/feed.atom">TILs</a>. 
 Niche Museums offers a "Use my location" button which then serves <a href="https://www.niche-museums.com/?latitude=37.5&amp;longitude=-122.5">museums near you</a>, using <a href="https://www.niche-museums.com/browse/nearby">a SQL query</a> that makes use of the <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-haversine">datasette-haversine</a> plugin. 
 
<p>A common complaint about static site generators when used for larger sites is that build times can get pretty long if the builder has to generate tens of thousands of pages.</p>
<p>With Baked Data, 10,000 pages can be generated by a single template file and 10,000 rows in a SQLite database table.</p>
<p>This also makes for a faster iteration cycle during development: you can edit a template and hit "refresh" to see any page rendered by the new template instantly, without needing to rebuild any pages.</p>
 Want to give this a go? 
<p>If you want to give the Baked Data pattern a try, I recommend starting out using the combination of <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a>, <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions">GitHub Actions</a> and <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>. Hopefully the examples I've provided above are a good starting point - also feel free to reach out to me <a href="https://twitter.com/">on Twitter</a> or in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/discussions">the Datasette Discussions forum</a> with any questions.</p>

    The last article was about being <a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo/the-railroad-of-no-choice-a55420cea06f">railroaded</a> in the first 100 days, recognising that you are forced into a decision.&nbsp; In this one I wanted to unpack that “data” shows that using science in an argument (say to defend against railroading) just makes the members of the team more partisan (aligned to their own confirmation bias and opinions).&nbsp; As the #CDO, your job is to use data and science, therefore in the first 100 days, with this insight, you are more likely to lose more people than win friends, lose more arguments than win and create bigger hurdles? &nbsp; What I suggest, based on this work is that to overcome “proof by science” is to use curiosity to bring us together. <p></p><p>Image source: from a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/curious-leader-douglas-longenecker/">good article</a> by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/douglaslongenecker/">Douglas Longenecker</a></p><p>---</p><p><a href="https://law.yale.edu/dan-m-kahan">Dan Kahan</a>, a Yale behavioural economist, has spent the last decade studying whether the use of reason aggravates or reduces “partisan” beliefs. His research papers are <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=45442">here</a>. His research shows that aggravation and alienation easily win, irrespective of being more liberal or conservative. The more we use our faculties for scientific thought, the more likely we are to take a strong position that aligns with our (original) political group (or thought).&nbsp;</p><p>A way through this is to copy “<a href="https://www.solutionsjournalism.org/">solution journalism</a>” which reports on ways that people and governments meaningfully respond to difficult problems and not on what the data says the problem is. Rather than use our best insights, analysis and thinking to reach the version of the “truth”, we use data to find ways to agree with others opinions in our communities. We help everyone to become curious. &nbsp; I use the<a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/"> Peak Paradox</a> framework as an approach to remaining curious as to where we are aligned and where there is a delta.&nbsp;</p><p>What happens when we use data and science in our arguments and explain what the problem is, is that the individuals will selectively credit and discredit information in patterns that reflect their commitment to certain values. They (we) (I) assimilate what they (we)(I) want.&nbsp;</p><p>Kahan, in 2014, <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2459057">asked over 1,500 respondents</a> whether they agreed or disagreed with the following statement: “There is solid evidence of recent global warming due mostly to human activity such as burning fossil fuels.” They collected information on individuals political beliefs, and rated their science intelligence.” The analysis found that those with the least science intelligence actually have less partisan positions than those with the most. A Conservative with strong science intelligence will use their skills to find evidence against human-caused global warming, while a Liberal will find evidence for it (cognitive bias.)&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>In the chart above, the y-axis represents the probability of a person agreeing that human activity caused climate change, and x-axis represents the percentile a person scored on the scientific knowledge test. The width of the bars shows the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval">confidence interval</a> for that probability.</p><p>As a CDO a most disconcerting finding is that individuals with more “scientific intelligence” are the quickest to align themselves on subjects they don’t know anything about. In one experiment, Kahan analyzed how people’s opinions on an <a href="http://www.nanotechproject.org/file_download/files/NanotechRiskPerceptions-DanKahan.pdf">unfamiliar subject</a> is affected when given some basic scientific information, along with details about what people in their self-identified political group tend to believe about that subject. It turned out that those with the strongest scientific reasoning skills were the ones most likely to use the information to develop partisan opinions.</p><p>Critically Kahan’s research shows that people that score well on a measure called “scientific curiosity” actually show less partisanship, and it is this aspect we need to use.</p><p>As CDO’s, we need to move away from “truth”, “facts”, “data” and “right decisions” if we want to have a board and senior team who can become aligned.&nbsp; We need to present ideas, concepts, how others are finding solutions and make our teams more curious.&nbsp; Being curious appears to be the best way to bring us together - however counterintuitive that is.</p><br><p>-----</p><p>Whilst our ongoing agile iteration into <a href="https://opengovernance.net/what-occurs-when-physical-beings-transition-to-information-beings-146ea9dcbca3">information beings</a> is never-ending, there are the first 100 days in the new role. But what to focus on? Well, that rose-tinted period of conflicting priorities is what <a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo/">&lt;/Hello, CDO!&gt;</a> is all about. Maintaining sanity when all else has been lost to untested data assumptions is a different problem entirely.</p> <br>

    Questions to help frame your own paradoxes <p>Leadership must be <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/post/in-leadership-why-is-recognising-paradox-critically-important">able to recognise the paradoxes created</a> as they decide on “<a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/post/what-are-we-optimising-for">what they are optimising for.</a>” The last article described two different starting points for the Peak Paradox model; <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/post/hello-world">finding paradox</a> and<a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/post/plotting-how-to-make-better-decisions"> living with paradox</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>It is evident that the compromises we elect to live with become more focused as we agreed or decide on what we are optimising for.&nbsp; Such a focus has a benefit insomuch that the narrower and more articulate our view of optimised becomes, the more <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/post/plotting-how-to-make-better-decisions">decisions can become aligned</a>. However, the counter is that whilst a sharp focus and alignment will require less compromise for some, but it will equally increase the paradoxes/ compromises and tensions others will have to live with.&nbsp; One team can be aligned to a vision but not necessarily on how to get there or live with the chosen “optimised” approach.&nbsp; Stress is created by these differences and can create cracks and weaknesses in the team and culture. One vision, one culture, one team is very naive in any team more extensive than one.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Sufficient dwell or thinking time is often not afforded to executive and leadership teams. Indeed board agendas are so packed and time so restricted there is little opportunity to debate or descent. The consequence of this reality is that insufficient time is allowed to consider the impacts of your optimising choices on others.&nbsp; Therefore over the next few posts, I will offer questions at different levels as per the <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/post/plotting-how-to-make-better-decisions">decision model</a> (below.)&nbsp; This is a <a href="https://opengovernance.net/choice-decision-making-and-judgment-is-your-relationship-constructive-or-destructive-c0e3b076e0a6">link</a> to a longer article on <a href="https://opengovernance.net/choice-decision-making-and-judgment-is-your-relationship-constructive-or-destructive-c0e3b076e0a6">choices, decisions, and judgment</a> as it frames; “are we asking the right questions?”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The outer yellow ring is the focus of this article. Below are five questions per “Peak” that should help facilitate a conversation to maximise benefits within this space or improve understanding of the compromises other will have to make to come to your peak.&nbsp;</p><p></p><br><br><p>As a reminder of what the peaks represent.&nbsp; The original <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/post/hello-world">detailed definitions of each peak are here.&nbsp;</a></p><p>Peak Individual Purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;At the exclusion of anything else, you are only interested in yourself.&nbsp; Selflessness at the extreme.&nbsp; You believe that you are sovereign (not having to ask anyone for permission or forgiveness), your voice and everything you say matters and everyone should agree. You are all-powerful and can do whatever you want and have the freedom and agency to do it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Peak Work Purpose.&nbsp; At the exclusion of anything else, the only reason to work is to deliver as much possible value to the shareholders.&nbsp; Employees, customers, the environment does not matter in terms of exploitation.&nbsp; The purpose is to be the biggest and most efficient beast on the planet and able to deliver enormous returns; Shareholder Primacy at its most pure. Simple, clear, no conflict and no compromise, even to the point that rewarding the staff beyond fair would be a compromise.&nbsp; Compliance is met with the minimal standard ensuring that nothing is wasted.&nbsp; (note: it is not the reason an individual works, but a company works)</p><p>Peak Society Purpose. &nbsp;At the exclusion of anything else, we have to deliver and ensure there is no suffering and poverty for any living thing. Humans must have equal education, health and safety.&nbsp; There must be total transparency and equality.&nbsp; Everything is equally shared, and on-one has more power, agency or influence than anyone else.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Peak Human Purpose.&nbsp; At the exclusion of anything else, we are here to escape death which we do by reproducing as much as we can with the broadest community we can.&nbsp; We also have to adapt as fast as possible.&nbsp; We have to meet our chemistry requirements to stay alive for as long as possible to adopt and reproduce at the expense of anything else.&nbsp; Whilst all the peak purposes might be controversial (even to myself), saying purity of human purpose in chemistry/ biology might not go down very well. However, this is a model for framing thinking, so please go with it as it needs to be pure, and every other human purpose has conflicts with someone.</p><p>How would you answer these questions?</p><p></p><p></p><p>It should be evident that these questions try to frame you towards a natural one peak, but even at this level, you will have noticed that whilst you will align more to one peak than the others, but that you are full of paradoxes.&nbsp; Ask different questions, you will align to a different north star.&nbsp;</p><br><br><br>

<p>In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/07/24/pl-pgsql-versus-pl-python-heres-why-im-using-both-to-write-postgres-functions/">episode 2</a> of this series I noted that the languages in which I’m writing Postgres functions share a common type system. It took me a while to understand how types work in the context of Postgres functions that can return sets of records and can interact with tables and materialized views.</p>
<p>Here is a set-returning function.</p>
 create function notes_for_user_in_group(
  _userid text, 
  _groupid text)
returns setof annotation as $$
  begin
    return query 
      select * from annotation
      where userid = concat('acct:', _userid)
      and groupid = _groupid;
  end;
$$ language plpgsql;
 
<p>In this case the type that governs the returned set has already been defined: it’s the schema for the annotation table.</p>



Column
Type




id
uuid


created
timestamp without time zone

target_uri

<p>The function returns records matching a userid and groupid. I can now find the URLs of documents most recently annotated by me.</p>
 select
  target_uri
from notes_for_user_in_group('judell@hypothes.is', '__world__')
order by created desc
limit 3;
 
<p>The Postgres response:</p>
                  target_uri                  
---------------------------------------------
 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20020501
 https://www.infoworld.com/article/2886828/github-for-the-rest-of-us.html
 https://web.hypothes.is/help/formatting-annotations-with-markdown/
 http://example.com                          
(3 rows)
 
<p>You might wonder why the function’s parameters are prefixed with underscores. That’s because variables used in functions can conflict with names of columns in tables. Since none of our column names begin with underscore, it’s a handy differentiator. Suppose the function’s signature were instead:</p>
 create function notes_for_user_in_group(
  userid text, 
  groupid text)
 
<p>Postgres would complain about a confict:</p>
 ERROR:  column reference "userid" is ambiguous
LINE 2:       where userid = concat('acct:', userid)
                    ^
DETAIL:  It could refer to either a PL/pgSQL variable or a table column.
 
<p>The table has userid and groupid columns that conflict with their eponymous variables. So for functions that combine variables and database values I prefix variable names with underscore.</p>
<p>Set-returning functions can be called in any SQL SELECT context. In the example above that context is psql, Postgres’ powerful and multi-talented REPL (read-eval-print loop). For an example of a different context, let’s cache the function’s result set in a materialized view.</p>
 create materialized view public_notes_for_judell as (
  select
    *
  from notes_for_user_in_group('judell@hypothes.is', '__world__')
  order by created desc
) with data;
 
<p>Postgres reports success by showing the new view’s record count.</p>
 SELECT 3972
 
<p>The view’s type is implicitly annotation; its schema matches the one shown above; selecting target_uri from the view is equivalent to selecting target_uri from the setof annotation returned from the function notes_for_user_in_group.</p>
 select
  target_uri
from public_notes_for_judell
limit 3;
 
<p>The Postgres response is the same as above.</p>
                  target_uri                  
---------------------------------------------
 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20020501
 https://www.infoworld.com/article/2886828/github-for-the-rest-of-us.html
 https://web.hypothes.is/help/formatting-annotations-with-markdown/
 http://example.com                          
(3 rows)
 
<p>It shows up a lot faster though! Every time you select the function’s result set, the wrapped query has to run. For this particular example that can take a few seconds. It costs the same amount of time to create the view. But once that’s done you can select its contents in milliseconds.</p>
<p>Now let’s define a function that refines notes_for_user_in_group by reporting the count of notes for each annotated document.</p>
 create function annotated_docs_for_user_in_group(
  _userid text, 
  _groupid text)
returns table (
  count bigint,
  userid text,
  groupid text,
  url text
) as $$
  begin
    return query
      select
        count(n.*) as anno_count,
        n.userid,
        n.groupid,
        n.target_uri
      from notes_for_user_in_group(_userid, _groupid) n
      group by n.userid, n.groupid, n.target_uri                          
      order by anno_count desc;
  end;
$$ language plpgsql;
 
<p>Instead of returning a setof some named type, this function returns an anonymous table. I’ve aliased the set-returning function call notes_for_user_in_group as n and used the alias to qualify the names of selected columns. That avoids another naming conflict. If you write userid instead of n.userid in the body of the function and then call it, Postgres again complains about a conflict.</p>
 ERROR:  column reference "userid" is ambiguous
LINE 3:         userid,
                ^
DETAIL:  It could refer to either a PL/pgSQL variable or a table column.
 
<p>Here’s a sample call to our new function..</p>
 select 
  *
from annotated_docs_for_user_in_group(
  'judell',
  'hypothes.is',
  '__world__'
);
 
<p>The result:</p>
  count | userid             | groupid   | target_uri
-------+---------------------------------------------
   516 | judell@hypothes.is | __world__ | http://shakespeare.mit.edu/macbeth/full.html
    73 | judell@hypothes.is | __world__ | https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/india-floods-bangladesh-nepal-deaths-millions-homeless-latest-news-updates-a7919006.html

<p>Now let’s create a view based on that function.</p>
 create materialized view url_counts_for_public_notes_by_judell as (
  select 
    *
  from annotated_docs_for_user_in_group(
    'judell@hypothes.is',
    '__world__'
  )
) with data;
 
<p>Postgres says:</p>
 SELECT 1710
 
<p>When you ask for the definition of that view using the \d command in psql:</p>
<p>\d url_counts_for_public_notes_by_judell</p>
<p>It responds with the same table definition used when creating the function.</p>
  Column  |  Type  
---------+--------
 count   | bigint
 userid  | text
 groupid | text
 url     | text   
 
<p>Behind the scenes Postgres has created this definition from the anonymous table returned by the function.</p>
<p>To revise the function so that it uses a named type, first create the type.</p>
 create type annotated_docs_for_user_in_group as (
  count bigint,
  userid text,
  groupid text,
  url text
);
 
<p>Postgres reports success:</p>
 CREATE TYPE
 
<p>Now we can use that named type in the function. Since we’re redefining the function, first drop it.</p>
 drop function annotated_docs_for_user_in_group;
 
<p>Uh oh. Postgres is unhappy about that.</p>
 ERROR:  cannot drop function annotated_docs_for_user_in_group(text,text) because other objects depend on it
DETAIL:  materialized view url_counts_for_public_notes_by_judell depends on function annotated_docs_for_user_in_group(text,text)
HINT:  Use DROP ... CASCADE to drop the dependent objects too.
 
<p>A view that depends on a function must be recreated when the function’s signature changes. I’ll say more about this in a future episode on set-returning functions that dynamically cache their results in materialized views. For now, since the view we just created is a contrived throwaway, just drop it along with the function by using CASCADE as Postgres recommends.</p>
 drop function annotated_docs_for_user_in_group cascade;
 
<p>Postgres says:</p>
 NOTICE:  drop cascades to materialized view url_counts_for_public_notes_by_judell
DROP FUNCTION
 
<p>Now we can recreate a version of the function that returns setof annotated_docs_for_user_in_group instead of an anonymous table(...)</p>
 create function annotated_docs_for_user_in_group(
  _userid text, 
  _groupid text)
returns setof annotated_docs_for_user_in_group as $$
  begin
    return query
      select
        count(n.*) as anno_count,
        n.userid,
        n.groupid,
        n.target_uri
      from notes_for_user_in_group(_userid, _groupid) n
      group by n.userid, n.groupid, n.target_uri                          
      order by anno_count desc;
  end;
$$ language plpgsql;
 
<p>The results are the same as above. So why do it this way? In many cases I don’t. It’s extra overhead to declare a type. And just as a view can depend on a function, a function can depend on a type. To see why you might not want such dependencies, suppose we want to also track the most recent note for each URL.</p>
 create type annotated_docs_for_user_in_group as (
  count bigint,
  userid text,
  groupid text,
  url text,
  most_recent_note timestamp
);
 
<p>That won’t work.</p>
 ERROR:  type "annotated_docs_for_user_in_group" already exists
 
<p>Dropping the type won’t work either.</p>
 ERROR:  cannot drop type annotated_docs_for_user_in_group because other objects depend on it                           
DETAIL:  function annotated_docs_for_user_in_group(text,text,text) depends on type annotated_docs_for_user_in_group    
HINT:  Use DROP ... CASCADE to drop the dependent objects too.
 
<p>To redefine the type you have to do a cascading drop and then recreate functions that depend on the type. If any of those views depend on dropped functions, the drop cascades to them as well and they also must be recreated. That’s why I often write functions that return table(...) rather than setof TYPE. In dynamic languages it’s convenient to work with untyped bags of values; I find the same to be true when writing functions in Postgres.</p>
<p>Sometimes, though, it’s useful to declare and use types. In my experience so far it makes most sense to do that in Postgres when you find yourself writing the same returns table(...) statement in several related functions. Let’s say we want a function that combines the results of annotated_docs_for_user_in_group for some set of users.</p>
 create function annotated_docs_for_users_in_group(_userids text[], _groupid text)
  returns setof annotated_docs_for_user_in_group as $$
    begin
      return query 
        with userids as (
          select unnest(_userids) as userid
        )
        select 
          a.*
        from userids u
        join annotated_docs_for_user_in_group(u.userid, _groupid) a
          on a.userid = concat('acct:', u.userid);
    end;
$$ language plpgsql;
 
<p>This new function uses the SQL WITH clause to create a common table expression (CTE) that converts an inbound array of userids into a transient table-like object, named userids, with one userid per row. The new function’s wrapped SQL then joins that CTE to the set returned from annotated_docs_for_user_in_group and returns the joined result.</p>
<p>(You can alternatively do this in a more procedural way by creating a loop variable and marching through the array to accumulate results. Early on I used that approach but in the context of Postgres functions I’ve come to prefer the more purely SQL-like set-oriented style.)</p>
<p>Sharing a common type between the two functions makes them simpler to write and easier to read. More importantly it connects them to one another and to all views derived from them. If I do decide to add most_recent_note to the type, Postgres will require me to adjust all depending functions and views so things remain consistent. That can be a crucial guarantee, and as we’ll see in a future episode it’s a key enabler of an advanced caching mechanism.</p>

  <p>Summary: Picos are a programming model for building decentralized applications that provide significant benefits in the form of abstractions that reduce programmer effort. Here are ten eleven reasons you should use picos for your next decentralized application.</p>



    <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/02/building_decentralized_applications_with_pico_networks.shtml"></a>
	  Temperature Sensor Network Built from Picos


<p>
    I didn't start out to write a programming language that naturally supports decentralized programming using the actor-model, is cloud-native, serverless, and databaseless. Indeed, if I had, I likely wouldn't have succeeded. Instead picos evolved from a simple rule language for modifying web pages to a powerful, general-purpose programming system for building any decentralized application. This post explains what picos are and why they are a great way to build decentralized systems. 
</p>

<p>
    Picos are persistent compute objects. Persistence is a core feature that distinguishes picos from other programming models. Picos exhibit persistence in three ways:
</p> 
     Persistent identity—Picos exist, with a single identity, continuously from the moment of their creation until they are destroyed. 
     Persistent state—Picos have persistent state that programs running in the pico can see and alter. The state is is isolated and only available inside the pico. 
     Persistent availability—Once a pico is created, it is always on and ready to process queries and events.
     
 
<p></p>

<p>
    Persistent identity, state, and availability make picos ideal for modeling entities of all sorts. Applications are formed from cooperating networks of picos, creating systems that better match programmer's mental models. Picos employ the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">actor model</a> abstraction for distributed computation. Specifically, in response to a received message, a pico may
</p>
 
     send messages to other picos—Picos <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2013/12/pico_apis_events_and_queries.shtml">respond to events and queries</a> by running rules. Depending on the rules installed, a pico may raise events for itself or other picos. 
     create other picos—Picos can create child picos and delete them.  
     change its internal state (which can affect their behavior when the next message is received)—Each pico has a set of persistent variables that can only be affected by rules that run in response to events. 
 

<p>
    In addition to the parent-child hierarchy, picos can be arranged in a heterachical network for peer-to-peer communication and computation. A cooperating network of picos reacts to messages, changes state, and sends messages. Picos have an internal event bus for distributing those messages to rules installed in the pico. Rules in the pico are selected to run based on declarative <a href="https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/pages/1189912/Event+Expressions">event expressions</a>. The pico matches events on the bus with event scenarios declared in each rule's event expressions. Any rule whose event expression matches is scheduled for execution. Executing rules may raise additional events. More detail about the <a href="https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/pages/1189951/Event+Loop+Introduction">event loop and pico execution model</a> are available elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
    Here are ten reasons picos are a great development environment for building decentralized applications:
</p>

 
     Picos can be a computational node that represents or models anything: person, place, organization, smart thing, dumb thing, concept, <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2013/04/pot_holes_and_picos.shtml">even a pothole</a>. Because picos encapsulate identity and state, they can be used to easily model entities of all types. 
     
     Picos use a substitutable hosting model. Picos are hosted on the open-source <a href="https://github.com/Picolab/pico-engine">pico engine</a>. Picos can be moved from pico engine to pico engine without loss of functionality or a change in their identifying features1. More importantly, an application built using picos can employ picos running on multiple engines without programmer effort. 
     
     Pico-based applications are scalable. Picos provide a decentralized programming model which ensures that an application can use whatever number of picos it needs without locks or multi-threading. Pico-based applications are fully sharded, meaning there is a computational node with isolated state for every entity of interest. Because these nodes can run on different engines without loss of functionality or programmer effort, pico-based applications scale fluidly. Picos provide an architectural model for <a href="https://www.rtinsights.com/event-processing-internet-things-trillion-node-network/">trillion-node networks</a> where literally everything is online. This provides a better, <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/07/alternatives_to_the_compuserve_of_things.shtml">more scalable model for IoT than the current CompuServe of Things</a>. 
     
     Picos can provide high availability in spite of potentially unreliable hosting. Multiple picos, stored in many places can be used to represent a specific entity. Picos modeling a popular web page, for example, could be replicated countless times to ensure the web page is available when needed with low latency. Copies would be eventually consistent with one another and no backups would be needed. 
     
     Picos are naturally concurrent without the need for locks. Each pico is an island of determinism that can be used as a building block for non-determinant decentralized systems. Each pico is isolated from any other pico, asynchronous processing is the default, and facts about the pico are published through protocols. State changes are determined by rules and respond to incoming messages seen as events. This minimizes contention and supports the efficient use of resources. 
     
     Picos provide a cloud-native (internet-first) architecture that matches the application architecture to the cloud model. The pico programming model lets developers focus on business logic, not infrastructure. Applications built with picos don't merely reside in the cloud. They are architected to be performant while decentralized. Picos support <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2016/04/reactive_programming_patterns_examples_from_fuse.shtml#event_errors">reactive programming patterns</a> that ensure applications are decoupled in both space and time to the extent possible. 
     
     Picos enable stateful, databaseless programming. Picos model domain objects in code, not in database tables. Developers don't waste time setting up, configuring, or maintaining a database. Each ruleset forms a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)">closure</a> over the set of persistent variables used in it. Programmers simply use a variable and it is automatically persisted and available whenever a rule or function in the ruleset is executed. 
     
     Picos use an extensible service model where new functionality can be layered on. Functionality within a pico is provided by rules that respond to events. An event-based programming model ensures <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2014/07/fuse_as_a_microservice_architecture.shtml">services inside a pico are loosely coupled</a>. And isolation of state changes between services (implemented as rulesets) inside the pico ensure a new service can be added without interfering with existing services. An event can select new rules while also selecting existing rules without the programmer changing the control flow2. 
     
     Picos naturally support a <a href="https://principles.reactive.foundation/principles/index.html">Reactive programming model</a>. Reactive programming with picos directly addresses the challenges of building decentralized applications through abstractions, programming models, data handling, protocols, interaction schemes, and error handling3.  In a pico application, distribution is first class and decentralization is natural. You can read more about this in <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/02/building_decentralized_applications_with_pico_networks.shtml">Building Decentralized Applications with Pico Networks</a> and <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2016/04/reactive_programming_patterns_examples_from_fuse.shtml">Reactive Programming Patterns: Examples from Fuse</a>.
     
     Picos provide better control over terms, apps, and data. This is a natural result of the pico model where each thing has a closure over services and data. Picos cleanly separate the data for different entities. Picos, representing a specific entity, and microservices, representing a specific business capability within the pico, provide fine grained control over data and its processing. For example, if you <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/12/relationships_in_the_self-sovereign_internet_of_things.shtml#selling">sell your car, you can transfer the vehicle pico to the new owner</a>, after deleting the trip service, and its associated data, while leaving untouched the maintenance records, which are stored as part of the maintenance service in the pico.
     
 

<p>
    And a bonus reason for using picos:
</p>

 
     Picos provide a better model for building the Internet of Things. Picos are an antidote to the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/07/alternatives_to_the_compuserve_of_things.shtml">CompuServe of Things</a> because they provide a scalable, decentralized model for connecting everything. We built a connected car platform called Fuse to prove this model works (<a href="https://www.windley.com/tags/fuse.shtml">read more about Fuse</a>). Picos are a natural building block for the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/12/the_self-sovereign_internet_of_things.shtml">self-sovereign internet of things (SSIoT)</a> and can easily model necessary <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/12/relationships_in_the_self-sovereign_internet_of_things.shtml">IoT relationship</a>. Picos create an IoT architecture that allows interoperable interactions between devices from different manufacturers.

 Notes 

 
     The caveat on this statement is that pico engines currently use URLs to identify channels used for inter-pico communication. Moving to a different engine could change the URLs that identify channels because the domain name of the engine changes. These changes can be automated. Future developments on the roadmap will reduce the use of domain names in the pico engine to make moving picos from engine to engine even easier.
     
     
        Note that while rules within a ruleset are guaranteed to execute in the order they appear, rules selected from different rulesets for the same event offer no ordering guarantee. When ordering is necessary, this can be done using <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2016/04/reactive_programming_patterns_examples_from_fuse.shtml#intra_pico_event_patterns">rule chaining, guard rules, and idempotence</a>. 
     
     I first heard this expressed by Jonas Bonér in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5kek8vx2ws&amp;t=1s">Reactive Summit 2020 Keynote</a>.

In that, the seed for the Trustee DID is well known, so once you’ve started the von-network, you can control it. In a “real” network, that seed (and associated private key) would of course be protected by that first Trustee.<br>For Sovrin, a ceremony was video’d of all the initial Trustees and Stewards (node operators) when MainNet was started in 2017.</p>

<p>This article shows how to implement an ASP.NET Core Razor page to authenticate against Azure B2C and use Web APIs from a second ASP.NET Core application which are also protected using Azure B2C App registrations. Azure B2C uses the signin, signup user flow and allows identities to authenticate using an Azure AD single tenant. Two APIs are implemented, one for users and one for administrators. Only identities from the Azure AD tenant can use the administrator API. The authorization implementation which forces this, is supported using an ASP.NET Core policy with a handler. </p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/azureb2c-fed-azuread">https://github.com/damienbod/azureb2c-fed-azuread</a></p>



<p>Setup</p>



<p>The ASP.NET Core applications only use Azure B2C to authenticate and authorize. An ASP.NET Core Razor page application is used for the UI, but this can be any SPA, Blazor app or whatever the preferred tech stack is. The APIs are implemented using ASP.NET Core and this uses Azure B2C to validate and authorize the access tokens. The application accepts two different access tokens from the same Azure B2C identity provider. Each API has a separate scope from the associating Azure App registration. The Admin API uses claims specific to the Azure AD identity to authorize only Azure AD internal users. Other identities cannot use this API and this needs to be validated. The Azure B2C identity provider federates to the Azure AD single tenant App registration. </p>







<p>Setup Azure B2C App registrations</p>



<p>Three Azure App registrations were created in Azure B2C to support the setup above. Two for the APIs and one for the UI. The API Azure App registrations are standard with just a scope definition. The scope access_as_user was exposed in both and the APIs can be used for user access.</p>



<p>The UI Azure App registration is setup to use an Azure B2C user flow and will have access to both APIs. You need to select the options with the user flows.</p>







<p>Add the APIs to the permissions of the Azure app registration for the UI application.</p>







<p>Setup Azure AD App registration</p>



<p>A single tenant Azure App registration needs to be created in the Azure AD for the internal or admin users. The redirect URL for this is <a href="https://”your-tenant-specific-path”/oauth2/authresp">https://”your-tenant-specific-path”/oauth2/authresp</a>. This will be used from an Azure B2C social login using the Open ID Connect provider. You also need to define a user secret and use this later. At present only secrets can be defined in this UI. This is problematic because the secrets have a max expiry of 2 years, if defining this in the portal.</p>







<p>Setup Azure B2C identity provider</p>



<p>A custom identity provider needs to be created to access the single tenant Azure AD for the admin identity authentication. Select the Identity providers in Azure B2C and create a new Open ID Connect custom IDP. Add the data to match the Azure App registration created in the previous step.</p>







<p>Setup Azure B2C user flow </p>



<p>Now a signin, signup user flow can be created to implement the Azure B2C authentication process and the registration process. This will allow local Azure B2C guest users and also the internal administrator users from the Azure AD tenant. The idp claim is required and idp_access_token claim if you require user data from the Azure AD identity. Add the required claims when creating the user flow. The claims can be added when creating the user flow in the User attributes and token claims section. Select the custom Open ID Connect provider and add this to the flow as well.</p>







<p>The user flow is now setup. The Azure App registrations can now be used to login and use either API as required. The idp and the idp_access_token are added for the Azure AD sign-in and this can be validated when using the admin API. </p>



<p>Implementing ASP.NET Core Razor page with Microsoft.Identity.Web</p>



<p>The ASP.NET Core application is secured using the Microsoft.Identity.Web and the Microsoft.Identity.Web.UI Nuget packages. These packages implement the Open ID connect clients and handles the Azure B2C specific client handling. The AddMicrosoftIdentityWebAppAuthentication method is used to add this and the AzureAdB2C configuration is defined to read the configuration from the app.settings, user secrets, key vault or whatever deployment is used. The rest is standard ASP.NET Core setup.</p>


  public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
	services.AddTransient&lt;AdminApiOneService&gt;();
	services.AddTransient&lt;UserApiOneService&gt;();
	services.AddHttpClient();

	services.AddOptions();

	string[] initialScopes = Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("UserApiOne:ScopeForAccessToken")?.Split(' ');

	services.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebAppAuthentication(Configuration, "AzureAdB2C")
		.EnableTokenAcquisitionToCallDownstreamApi(initialScopes)
		.AddInMemoryTokenCaches();

	services.AddRazorPages().AddMvcOptions(options =&gt;
	{
		var policy = new AuthorizationPolicyBuilder()
			.RequireAuthenticatedUser()
			.Build();
		options.Filters.Add(new AuthorizeFilter(policy));
	}).AddMicrosoftIdentityUI();
}

public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
	if (env.IsDevelopment())
	{
		app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
	}
	else
	{
		app.UseExceptionHandler("/Error");
		app.UseHsts();
	}

	app.UseHttpsRedirection();
	app.UseStaticFiles();

	app.UseRouting();

	app.UseAuthentication();
	app.UseAuthorization();

	app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =&gt;
	{
		endpoints.MapRazorPages();
		endpoints.MapControllers();
	});
}
  


<p>The Micorosoft.Identity.Web package uses the AzureAdB2C settings for the configuration. This example is using Azure B2C and the configuration for Azure B2C is different to an Azure AD configuration. The Instance MUST be set to domain of the Azure B2C tenant and the SignUpSignInPolicyId must be set to use the user flow as required. A signin, signup user flow is used here. The rest is common for be Azure AD and Azure B2C settings. The ScopeForAccessToken matches the two Azure App registrations created for the APIs.</p>

},
  


<p>The Admin Razor page uses the AuthorizeForScopes to authorize for the API it uses. This Razor page uses the API service to access the admin API. No authorization is implemented in the UI to validate the identity. Normally the page would be hidden if the identity is not an administrator , I left this out in so that it is easier to validate this in the API as this is only a demo.</p>


  namespace AzureB2CUI.Pages
{
    [AuthorizeForScopes(Scopes = new string[] { "https://b2cdamienbod.onmicrosoft.com/5f4e8bb1-3f4e-4fc6-b03c-12169e192cd7/access_as_user" })]
    public class CallAdminApiModel : PageModel
    {
        private readonly AdminApiOneService _apiService;

        public JArray DataFromApi { get; set; }
        public CallAdminApiModel(AdminApiOneService apiService)
        {
            _apiService = apiService;
        }

        public async Task OnGetAsync()
        {
            DataFromApi = await _apiService.GetApiDataAsync().ConfigureAwait(false);
        }
    }
}
  


<p>The API service uses the ITokenAcquisition to get an access token for the defined scope. If the identity and the Azure App registration are authorized to access the API, then an access token is returned for the identity. This is sent using a HttpClient created using the IHttpClientFactory interface.</p>


  using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using Microsoft.Identity.Web;
using Newtonsoft.Json.Linq;
using System;
using System.Net.Http;
using System.Net.Http.Headers;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace AzureB2CUI
{
    public class AdminApiOneService
    {
        private readonly IHttpClientFactory _clientFactory;
        private readonly ITokenAcquisition _tokenAcquisition;
        private readonly IConfiguration _configuration;

        public AdminApiOneService(IHttpClientFactory clientFactory, 
            ITokenAcquisition tokenAcquisition, 
            IConfiguration configuration)
        {
            _clientFactory = clientFactory;
            _tokenAcquisition = tokenAcquisition;
            _configuration = configuration;
        }

        public async Task&lt;JArray&gt; GetApiDataAsync()
        {

            var client = _clientFactory.CreateClient();

            var scope = _configuration["AdminApiOne:ScopeForAccessToken"];
            var accessToken = await _tokenAcquisition.GetAccessTokenForUserAsync(new[] { scope }).ConfigureAwait(false);

            client.BaseAddress = new Uri(_configuration["AdminApiOne:ApiBaseAddress"]);
            client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", accessToken);
            client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Accept.Add(new MediaTypeWithQualityHeaderValue("application/json"));

            var response = await client.GetAsync("adminaccess").ConfigureAwait(false);
            if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
            {
                var responseContent = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync().ConfigureAwait(false);
                var data = JArray.Parse(responseContent);

                return data;
            }

            throw new ApplicationException($"Status code: {response.StatusCode}, Error: {response.ReasonPhrase}");
        }
    }
}

  


<p>Implementing the APIs with Microsoft.Identity.Web </p>



<p>The ASP.NET Core project implements the two separate APIs using separate authentication schemes and policies. The AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApiAuthentication method configures services for the user API using the default JWT scheme “Bearer” and the second scheme is setup for the “BearerAdmin” JWT bearer auth for the admin API. All API calls require an authenticated user which is setup in the AddControllers using a global policy. The AddAuthorization method is used to add an authorization policy for the admin API. The IsAdminHandler handler is used to fulfil the IsAdminRequirement requirement.</p>


  public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
	services.AddHttpClient();

	services.AddOptions();

	JwtSecurityTokenHandler.DefaultInboundClaimTypeMap.Clear();
	// IdentityModelEventSource.ShowPII = true;

	services.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApiAuthentication(
		Configuration, "AzureB2CUserApi");

	services.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApiAuthentication(
	   Configuration, "AzureB2CAdminApi", "BearerAdmin");

	services.AddControllers(options =&gt;
	{
		var policy = new AuthorizationPolicyBuilder()
			.RequireAuthenticatedUser()
			 // disabled this to test with users that have no email (no license added)
		     // .RequireClaim("email")
			.Build();
		options.Filters.Add(new AuthorizeFilter(policy));
	});

	services.AddSingleton&lt;IAuthorizationHandler, IsAdminHandler&gt;();

	services.AddAuthorization(options =&gt;
	{
		options.AddPolicy("IsAdminRequirementPolicy", policyIsAdminRequirement =&gt;
		{
			policyIsAdminRequirement.Requirements.Add(new IsAdminRequirement());
		});
	});
}
  


<p>The IsAdminHandler class checks for the idp claim and validates that the single tenant we require for admin identities is used to sign-in. The access token needs to be validated that the token was issued by our Azure B2C and that it has the correct scope. Since this is done in using the Microsoft.Identity.Web attributes, we don’t need to do this here. </p>


  public class IsAdminHandler : AuthorizationHandler&lt;IsAdminRequirement&gt;
{
	protected override Task HandleRequirementAsync(
		AuthorizationHandlerContext context, IsAdminRequirement requirement)
	{
		if (context == null)
			throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(context));
		if (requirement == null)
			throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(requirement));

		var claimIdentityprovider = context.User.Claims.FirstOrDefault(t =&gt; t.Type == "idp");

		// check that our tenant was used to signin
		if (claimIdentityprovider != null 
			&amp;&amp; claimIdentityprovider.Value == 
				"https://login.microsoftonline.com/7ff95b15-dc21-4ba6-bc92-824856578fc1/v2.0")
		{
			context.Succeed(requirement);
		}

		return Task.CompletedTask;
	}
}
  


<p>The AdminAccessController class is used to provide the admin data for admin identities. The BearerAdmin scheme is required and the IsAdminRequirementPolicy policy. The access token admin scope is also validated.</p>


  [Authorize(AuthenticationSchemes = "BearerAdmin", Policy = "IsAdminRequirementPolicy")]
[AuthorizeForScopes(Scopes = new string[] { "api://5f4e8bb1-3f4e-4fc6-b03c-12169e192cd7/access_as_user" })]
[ApiController]
[Route("[controller]")]
public class AdminAccessController : ControllerBase
{
	[HttpGet]
	public List&lt;string&gt; Get()
	{
		string[] scopeRequiredByApi = new string[] { "access_as_user" };
		HttpContext.VerifyUserHasAnyAcceptedScope(scopeRequiredByApi);

		return new List&lt;string&gt; { "admin data" };
	}
}
  


<p>The user API also validates the access token, this time using the default Bearer scheme. No policy is required here, so only the default global authorization filter is used. The user API scope is validated.</p>


  [Authorize(AuthenticationSchemes = "Bearer")]
[AuthorizeForScopes(Scopes = new string[] { "api://723191f4-427e-4f77-93a8-0a62dac4e080/access_as_user" })]
[ApiController]
[Route("[controller]")]
public class UserAccessController : ControllerBase
  


<p>When the application is run, the Azure B2C user flow is used to authenticate and internal or external users can sign-in, sign-up. This view can be customized to match your styles.</p>







<p>Admins can use the admin API and the guest users can use the user APIs.</p>







<p>Notes</p>



<p>This works but it can be improved and there are other ways to achieve this setup. If you require only a subset of identities from the Azure AD tenant, an enterprise app can be used to define the users which can use the Azure AD App registration. Or you can do this with an Azure group and assign this to the app and the users to the group. </p>



<p>You should also force MFA in the application for admins by validating the claims in the token and also the client ID which the token was created for. (as well as in the Azure AD tenant.)</p>



<p>Azure B2C is still using version one access tokens and seems and the federation to Azure AD does not use PKCE.</p>



<p>The Open ID Connect client requires a secret to access the Azure AD App registration. This can only be defined for a max of two years and it is not possible to use managed identities or a certificate. This means you would need to implement a secret rotation script or something so that to solution does not stop working. This is not ideal in Azure and is solved better in other IDPs. It should be possible to define long living secrets using the Powershell module and you update then with every release etc.</p>



<p>It would also be possible to use the Graph API to validate the identity accessing the admin API, user API. </p>



<p>Azure B2C API connectors could also be used to add extra claims to the tokens for usage in the application.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/07/21/a-virtuous-cycle-for-analytics/">A virtuous cycle for analytics</a> I noted that our library of Postgres functions is written in two languages: Postgres’ built-in pl/pgsql and the installable alternative pl/python. These share a common type system and can be used interchangeably.</p>
<p>Here’s a pl/pgsql classifier that tries to match the name of a course against a list of patterns that characterize the humanities.</p>
 create function humanities_classifier(course_name text) returns boolean as $$
  begin
    return
      lower(course_name) ~ any(array[
        'psych',
        'religio',
        'soci'
        ]);
  end;
$$ language plpgsql;

# select humanities_classifier('Religious Studies 101') as match;
match
-----
t

# select humanities_classifier('Comparative Religions 200') as match;
match
-----
t
 
<p>Here is that same classifier in Python.</p>
 create function humanities_classifier(course_name text) returns boolean as $$
  sql = f"""
    select lower('{course_name}') ~ any(array[
      'psych',
      'religio',
      'soci'
      ]) as match"""
  results = plpy.execute(sql)
  return results[0]['match']
$$ language plpython3u;

# select humanities_classifier('Religious Studies 101') as match;
match
-----
t

# select humanities_classifier('Comparative Religions 200') as match;
match
-----
t
 
<p>The results are exactly the same. In this case, Python is only wrapping the SQL used in the orginal function and interpolating course_name into it. So why use pl/python here? I wouldn’t. The pl/pgsql version is cleaner and simpler because the SQL body doesn’t need to be quoted and course_name doesn’t need to be interpolated into it.</p>
<p>Here’s a more Pythonic version of the classifier.</p>
 create function humanities_classifier(course_name text) returns boolean as $$
  import re
  regexes = [
    'psych',
    'religio',
    'soci'
  ]
  matches = [r for r in regexes if re.search(r, course_name, re.I)]
  return len(matches)
$$ language plpython3u;
 
<p>There’s no SQL here, this is pure Python. Is there any benefit to doing things this way? In this case probably not. The native Postgres idiom for matching a string against a list of regular expressions is cleaner and simpler than the Python technique shown here. A Python programmer will be more familiar with list comprehensions than with the Postgres any and ~ operators but if you’re working in Postgres you’ll want to know about those, and use them not just in functions but in all SQL contexts.</p>
<p>What about performance? You might assume as I did that a pl/pgsql function is bound to be way faster than its pl/python equivalent. Let’s check that assumption. This SQL exercises both flavors of the function, which finds about 500 matches in a set of 30,000 names.</p>
 with matching_courses as (
  select humanities_classifier(name) as match
  from lms_course_groups
) 

select count(*) 
from matching_courses
where match;
 
<p>Here are the results for three runs using each flavor of the function:</p>
  pl/pgsql: 159ms, 201ms, 125ms

pl/python: 290ms, 255ms, 300ms
 
<p>The Python flavor is slower but not order-of-magnitude slower; I’ve seen cases where a pl/python function outperforms its pl/pgsql counterpart.</p>
<p>So, what is special about Python functions inside Postgres? In my experience so far there are three big reasons to use it.</p>
<p>Python modules</p>
<p>The ability to wield any of Python’s built-in or loadable modules inside Postgres brings great power. That entails great responsibility, as the Python extension is “untrusted” (that’s the ‘u’ in ‘plpython3u’) and can do anything Python can do on the host system: read and write files, make network requests.</p>
<p>Here’s one of my favorite examples so far. Given a set of rows that count daily or weekly annotations for users in a group — so for weekly accounting each row has 52 columns — the desired result for the whole group is the element-wise sum of the rows. That’s not an easy thing in SQL but it’s trivial using numpy, and in pl/python it happens at database speed because there’s no need to transfer SQL results to an external Python program.</p>
<p>Metaprogramming</p>
<p>Functions can write and then run SQL queries. It’s overkill for simple variable interpolation; as shown above pl/pgsql does that handily without the cognitive overhead and visual clutter of poking values into a SQL string. For more advanced uses that compose queries from SQL fragments, though, pl/pgsql is hopeless. You can do that kind of thing far more easily, and more readably, in Python.</p>
<p>Introspection</p>
<p>A pl/python function can discover and use its own name. That’s the key enabler for a mechanism that memoizes the results of a function by creating a materialized view whose name combines the name of the function with the value of a parameter to the function. This technique has proven to be wildly effective.</p>
<p>I’ll show examples of these scenarios in later installments of this series. For now I just want to explain why I’ve found these two ways of writing Postgres functions to be usefully complementary. The key points are:</p>
<p>– They share a common type system.</p>
<p>– pl/pgsql, despite its crusty old syntax, suffices for many things.</p>
<p>– pl/python leverages Python’s strengths where they are most strategic</p>
<p>When I began this journey it wasn’t clear when you’d prefer one over the other, or why it might make sense to use both in complementary ways. This installment is what I’d like to have known when I started.</p>

  <p>This is the transcript and video from a talk I gave at PyGotham 2020 about using SQLite, Datasette and Dogsheep to work with small data.</p>
<p>I really like the term "small data", as a counterpoint to big data. I define small data as anything that fits on a mobile phone, and since my iPhone has half a terabyte of storage these days that ends up covering a lot of ground!</p>
<p>I think SQLite is the ideal tool for working with data that fits this definition.</p>
<p>My PyGotham talk demonstrates how to find SQLite databases that already exist on your laptop, how to use Datasette to explore them, and then expands to cover Datasette as a tool for publishing data online and my Dogsheep family of tools for personal analytics.</p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lig2gxPEZPo">the talk video on YouTube</a>. I've included a full transcript below with additional links and embedded code samples.</p>

  

 Transcript and notes 
<p>I'm going to spend the next 20 minutes trying to convince you that almost every data problem you have should be solved using <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a>.</p>
<p>This is also an excuse for me to promote open source project I've been working on for the last three years, called <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a>.</p>
<p>Datasette is a tool for exploring and publishing data that's stored in SQLite databases. So the more people I can use convince to use SQLite to solve things the better!</p>
<p>So let's talk about SQLite, which <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/mostdeployed.html">claims to be</a> the most widely deployed and used database in the world, and I think that claim holds up.</p>
<p>You may not have realised it, but you're using SQLite every single day. It's in phones and laptops. It's in embedded devices. I have an Apple Watch, so I'm wearing SQLite databases on my wrist right now.</p>
<p>Let's take a look on my laptop and see what we can find.</p>
<p>So <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/macos/find-largest-sqlite">this right here</a> is a magic incantation that on a Mac will search for the largest SQLite databases across the entire system.</p>
 <code>mdfind "kMDItemDisplayName == *.sqlite" -0 | \
  xargs -0 stat "-f%z %N" | sort -nr | head -n 20
</code> 
<p>I'm gonna run this right now to get my top 20. And here we are. Evernote is using SQLite, Firefox uses it, but the one at the top, this one is 857 megabytes for SQLite file. It's something to do with Apple Photos, so let's see what's in there.</p>
<p>Datasette can be <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/installation.html">installed</a> as a command-line application, you can run it against the path to a SQLite database, and it starts up a little local web server, which you can then use to explore that data.</p>
<p>So there are 67 tables in this Apple Photos database, with detected face prints and face crops and albums and all sorts of things.</p>
<p>But the one that I happen to know is super interesting is this one here. It's called the Z Cloud Master Media Meta Data. It has 44,000 rows in and I happen to know I've taken about 44,000 photographs - so it looks like there's some interesting stuff here.</p>
<p>This is kind of garbled, but there's a clue. The binary column here starts with BPlist, and I happen to know that Apple have a format called a binary plist, which is probably what this is.</p>
<p>So I'm gonna install a plugin for Datasette called <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-bplist">datasette-bplist</a> that knows what to do with that data. This is being installed from PyPI.</p>
 <code>datasette install datasette-bplist
</code> 
<p>And now I can start Datasette up again. Hit refresh on this page. And now that Z Data has been decoded into something that's a little bit more readable.</p>
<p>And straightaway we can see that OK, this is classic photo metadata. We've got the make and model of the device. we've got EXIF data. The really exciting stuff is we've got GPS data. So this is a database that includes the latitude and longitude of every photograph I've ever taken, and we're absolutely going to dig into that and see if we can do some interesting stuff with it later on.</p>
<p>So SQLite is clearly a pretty great database - if Apple are using it this extensively it must have some good things going on for it. But then why don't we use it for web applications?</p>
<p>Well, the classic answer to that is that the one thing SQLite is not so good at is accepting concurrent writes. If you've got a high traffic web site with lots of people writing to your database, you're better off with something like MySQL or Postgres.</p>
<p>But I realised that I have a whole bunch of use cases that don't require any writes at all. Any time I want to publish data online that isn't going to change, SQLite is actually a really good fit for that.</p>
<p>So that was the original inspiration for Datasette. I was thinking about how if I want to publish data online, is this a way I can do it that's really cheap and flexible and interesting?</p>
<p>So that's what I've been doing. I'll show you a few examples.</p>
<p>This is Covid-19 case data, which is published online right now by Johns Hopkins University. The New York Times, the L.A. Times and The Economist.</p>
<p><a href="https://covid-19.datasettes.com/">https://covid-19.datasettes.com/</a></p>
<p>They're all publishing their data as CSV files in GitHub repositories, which is pretty great because you get a commit history of changes to that CSV data. But it's not necessarily something you can dive straight into and start using.</p>
<p>That's where Datasette comes in. This is a Datasette instance which is automatically updated every day with the latest data from these different publications and I can drill through and see things like <a href="https://covid-19.datasettes.com/covid/ny_times_us_counties">this New York Times data</a> for example.</p>
<p>The New York Times publishes county level data of cases and deaths from Covid-19 and they've got over half a million rows in this spreadsheet. And so when we look at this data, it's pretty unexciting in a sort of table form. We've got the date, the county, the state, the FIPS code, which is a unique identify for each county, the number of cases and the number of deaths.</p>
<p>But Datasette kicks in and does some really useful things for us.</p>
<p>Firstly, Datasette has a concept of faceting where it looks for columns in the database which have a small number of unique values - like the State column for example, which only has 50 values in it, and it makes those available for navigation at the top along with these summary counts. So I can look down at this and say, Oh, look, Tennessee. Let's drill into <a href="https://covid-19.datasettes.com/covid/ny_times_us_counties?state=Tennessee">just the rows in this table that mention Tennessee</a>. And then Tennessee has 16,000 rows of which each county has a whole bunch. So let's look <a href="https://covid-19.datasettes.com/covid/ny_times_us_counties?state=Tennessee&amp;county=Rutherford">at Rutherford County</a> in Tennessee. That's 181 rows. And now that we've drilled down these two levels, we've got back a table that is just showing us the number of cases and number of deaths ordered my date.</p>
<p>So each of these rows says on the sixth of September, there have been 80 deaths reported in 8100 cases.</p>
<p>You saw a Datasette plugin earlier when I installed the bplist plugin. Another plugin I wrote is called <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-vega">Datasette Vega</a>. It gives you simple charting options, so we can say I want a bar chart that plots the date on the X axis against the number of cases on the Y axis. And now we've got <a href="https://covid-19.datasettes.com/covid/ny_times_us_counties?state=Tennessee&amp;county=Rutherford#g.mark=bar&amp;g.x_column=date&amp;g.x_type=ordinal&amp;g.y_column=cases&amp;g.y_type=quantitative">a chart of cases over time</a> in this particular county in the state of Tennessee.</p>
<p>A couple of other things you can do: You can export the data back out again so I could get this data <a href="https://covid-19.datasettes.com/covid/ny_times_us_counties.json?state=Tennessee&amp;county=Rutherford">as JSON</a> if I want to load this programmatically into something, and get it out <a href="https://covid-19.datasettes.com/covid/ny_times_us_counties.csv?state=Tennessee&amp;county=Rutherford">as CSV</a> if I want to load it into something like Microsoft Excel.</p>
<p>I can actually export it <a href="https://covid-19.datasettes.com/covid/ny_times_us_counties.yaml?state=Tennessee&amp;county=Rutherford">as YAML</a> because there's an <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-yaml">experimental plugin</a> I've been building that does a YAML export. And then, more importantly, you can <a href="https://covid-19.datasettes.com/covid?sql=select+rowid%2C+date%2C+county%2C+state%2C+fips%2C+cases%2C+deaths+from+ny_times_us_counties+where+%22county%22+%3D+%3Ap0+and+%22state%22+%3D+%3Ap1+order+by+date+desc+limit+101&amp;p0=Rutherford&amp;p1=Tennessee">view and edit the SQL query</a> that was used for this page.</p>
<p>Now this is one of the interesting things about publishing read-only data: because the data as read only and it's opened in a special read only mode, people executing SQL queries can't cause any damage to that database. So SQL injection which in most web applications is a serious security vulnerability for us, becomes a feature.</p>
<p>We could say I just want back the data on the cases and the deaths columns - I'm gonna hit "run SQL" and now I'm getting back <a href="https://covid-19.datasettes.com/covid?sql=select+date%2C+cases%2C+deaths+from+ny_times_us_counties+where+%22county%22+%3D+%3Ap0+and+%22state%22+%3D+%3Ap1+order+by+date+desc+limit+101&amp;p0=Rutherford&amp;p1=Tennessee">just that data that I requested</a>, and I could export that data back out again as JSON or CSV. So this becomes a really powerful way of remixing and slicing and dicing data and then getting it back out again in a format that I can use somewhere else.</p>
<p>So that's all well and good. But the obvious question is, how do you get this data into a SQLite file in the first place? So I'm gonna show you a demo using one of my favourite pieces of data of all time. This is the results of the 2018 <a href="https://www.thesquirrelcensus.com/">New York Central Park squirrel census</a>, where a bunch of volunteers went out and tried to answer the crucial question: "How many squirrels are there in Central Park?".</p>
<p>And this is published <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2018-Central-Park-Squirrel-Census-Squirrel-Data/vfnx-vebw">as a CSV file</a>, it's got 3,023 rows. Each row is a squirrel. And we can export that out and get back CSV. So I've got the file here. I'm gonna turn it into a SQLite database.</p>
<p>I have a tool I wrote called <a href="https://datasette.io/tools/csvs-to-sqlite">csvs-to-sqlite</a>, which takes a CSV file - or multiple CSV files - and turns them into, or loads them into SQLite. So here we go, I've run that command and and now I have <code>squirrels.db</code>, which is a SQLite database.</p>
 <code>csvs-to-sqlite 2018_Central_Park_Squirrel_Census_-_Squirrel_Data.csv squirrels.db
</code> 
<p>If I run <code>sqlite3 squirrels.db .schema</code>, it'll show me the schema - and it is indeed a table with columns for squirrels with unique squirrel IDS and which hectare they're in and all of that kind of stuff.</p>
 <code>datasette squirrels.db
</code> 
<p>And so now that we've done that, I can run <code>datasette squirrels.db</code> and start up Datasette and I can see that data in my browser. And here we go here, here are 3,000 rows of squirrel data.</p>
<p>Faceting is kind of fun: you can see things like primary fur colour, showing up as options there. And, actually, if we facet by that, we can say you know what? For the 392 cinnamon squirrels, let's see what the highlight fur colours are for those. Show me the 10 squirrels that are black and have cinnamon hair.</p>
<p>Another thing that stands out about this data is that there are these two columns here, X and Y, which look suspiciously like they might be latitudes and longitudes. We can do something really interesting with that.</p>
<p>I'm gonna load up the SQLite command-line tool for squirrels.db, and I'm gonna rename the X column to longitude.</p>
 <code>sqlite3 squirrels.db
alter table "2018_Central_Park_Squirrel_Census_-_Squirrel_Data"
rename column X to longitude;
alter table "2018_Central_Park_Squirrel_Census_-_Squirrel_Data"
rename column Y to latitude;
</code> 
<p>So "alter table" - um, quite a long table name this one - gonna alter this table here. Rename column X to longitude. And I'm gonna rename column Y to latitude. And now I'm going to check my datasette plugins and make sure I've got a plugin installed called <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-cluster-map">datasette-cluster-map</a>.</p>
<p>There it is. So now if I run Datasette against squirrels again and refresh this page, the plugin here notices the latitude and longitude columns and it draws them on the map. So this is a map of everywhere that they saw a cinnamon squirrel with black highlight fur.</p>
<p>And if I close off these filters you can see that here's a map of all 3,000 squirrels that were spotted in Central Park. And I can zoom in and explore the data that way.</p>
<p>That's pretty cool. Wouldn't it be cool if we could share this data on the Internet somehow?</p>
<p>So we've got a SQLite database. And this is where another key feature of Datasette comes in, which is the<a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/publish.html">"datasette publish</a> command.</p>
<p>Datasette Publish lets you publish databasees online, using <a href="https://cloud.google.com/run">Google Cloud Run</a> or <a href="https://heroku.com/">Heroku</a> or <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>. I'm going to use Vercel right now, so if I type <code>datasette publish vercel squirrels.db</code> - I need to give it a project name. I'm going to call it <code>pygotham-squirrels</code>. And I know that I want to install that <code>datasette-cluster-map</code> plugin as well.</p>
 <code>datasette publish vercel squirrels.db \
  --project=pygotham-squirrels \
  --install=datasette-cluster-map
</code> 
<p>So I run this command, and it packages up that database with the Datasette application itself, uploads it and starts running a build on Vercel. It gives me a URL here. I can watch it doing its thing - so it's installing runtimes, it's installing those required dependencies, that additional plugin. And normally, this only takes about 20 seconds to run. And at the end of that 20 seconds, I will have a Web application that is running online with that data.</p>
<p><a href="https://pygotham-squirrels.vercel.app/">https://pygotham-squirrels.vercel.app/</a></p>
<p>So anyone can visit this URL right now, click on that map and they get <a href="https://pygotham-squirrels.vercel.app/squirrels/2018_Central_Park_Squirrel_Census_-_Squirrel_Data">that Datasette of squirrels with the map plugin</a>, with the ability to facet by primary fur colour. It's all up there. It's running online and it's ready for other people to visit.</p>
<p>I designed this initially for newspapers based on my experience working at the Guardian newspaper, where we wanted to publish some of the data behind our stories, but as a way productively getting structured data onto the web in a way you can start using it I think this is really, really exciting as a capability.</p>
<p>And remember there are JSON APIs for this. So we have just published an API online for squirrel data that anyone who can write JavaScript or Python can start using to build their own squirrel maps.</p>
<p>Another thing that I've been doing with this is figuring out how to turn these into much more custom experiences.</p>
<p>Datasette allows you to provide <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/custom_templates.html">custom templates</a>, it lets you provide custom CSS, which means you can actually use it to build entire websites powered under the hood by Datasette.</p>
<p>One of the first I built was this one here. This is called <a href="https://www.niche-museums.com/">niche-museums.com</a> - it's a website for my hobby of trying to track down weird and niche museums around the world, I can click "Use my location" and see just the weird museums near me.</p>
<p>There's one just around the corner from our house called <a href="https://www.niche-museums.com/47">The Comic Book Rockstars Toilet Seat Museum</a>, where a local comic book store has been collecting toilet seats illustrated by famous comic artists. And if you're ever in San Francisco, you should absolutely pop by Hayes Valley and check this place out.</p>
<p>But this right here is just a heavily styled Datasette instance. If you go to <a href="https://www.niche-museums.com/browse">/browse</a>, it will give you access to the data. You can see that each museum is a row in a SQLite database table. I've got that plugin, so I get a free map showing you where everything is. Then the actual museum pages are just templated versions of the underlying Datasette pages.</p>
<p>I really like this as a way of publishing websites because it's gives you all of the benefits of static publishing where you it scales magically by starting up new instances, you don't have to worry about security holes and stuff because it's all read only data, but because there's a relational database under it, you can build features like search - so I can search for <a href="https://www.niche-museums.com/browse/search?q=bigfoot">Bigfoot</a> and get back the <a href="https://www.niche-museums.com/2">Bigfoot Discovery Museum</a>.</p>
<p>Or you can build things like this little "use my location", button at the top of the screen. But again, this is all built using Datasette and Datasette plugins. I have a plugin that knows how to turn a SQL query <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-atom">into an Atom feed</a> so that people can subscribe to new updates to the website as well.</p>
<p>But to finish, I want to talk about a totally different use-case for all of this stuff, and that's personal analytics.</p>
<p>This is an idea that I had had a year and a half ago, inspired by <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/02/seeking-the-productive-life-some-details-of-my-personal-infrastructure/">an essay written by Stephen Wolfram</a>. Stephen wrote this absolutely fascinating essay about his approach to personal productivity, and the main feature of this essay is the scroll bar down the side. This thing just goes on and on and on, and he talks about how he had a standing desk, but then his heart rate monitor showed him that he gets better health benefits from walking around outside. So he built himself a little like popcorn tray for his laptop. He scanned every document he's ever every document he's ever written from the age of 11. He's got all of this amazing infrastructure setup for being productive, most of which I feel is way over the top for how I want to live my life.</p>
<p>He has a green screen setup in his basement so he can give talks from home.</p>
<p>But there was one thing in here that kind of caught my eye, and that's this idea that he has of a metasearcher. It's a personal search engine that he built that can search every e-mail, every file, every paper he's written, all of the people he knows for any any search term.</p>
<p>And I saw this and I thought, you know, that's something I'd really like. I would love to have a personal search engine for all of my stuff.</p>
<p>But if I'm gonna build that and it's inspired by Stephen Wolfram, I need to come up with a decent name for it.</p>
<p>And so since it is inspired by Wolf Ram, but it's not really aiming to be as good or comprehensive as the thing that he built, I decided to call it Dog Sheep. So I have a project called <a href="https://dogsheep.github.io/">Dogsheep</a>. I love that pun so much I committed myself to actually building the software.</p>
<p>And so Dogsheep is a collection of tools for personal analytics: tools for pulling in data about yourself from lots of different sources, turning those into SQLite databases so that you can start working with them and then you can load them up in Datasette and start doing interesting things against them.</p>
<p>I'll give you a a demonstration of my personal Dogsheep instance, where all of the data from these tools ends up.</p>
<p>This is my personal Dogsheep. It has data from a a whole bunch of different places. I've got data from Twitter and HealthKit - my Apple Watch tracks my health over time. GitHub data, Foursquare Swarm, I pulled in data from LinkedIn and Goodreads and Hacker News and all of these different places, and I can do all sorts of fun things with this.</p>
<p>So I'll start by showing you a couple of things from from Twitter. So I index all of my tweets, anytime somebody mentions me, and all of the tweets that I've favorited and because I've indexed my favourited tweets I can run searches against them.</p>
<p>So I can search for PyGotham and see all of the tweets that I've favorited about PyGotham.</p>
<p>Twitter does not offer this feature themselves and having this feature suddenly makes Twitter favourites so, so much more useful.</p>
<p>I can search my followers so if I decide I want to have a conversation with a VC, I can type in VC and see anyone who follows me on Twitter who mentions VC in their bio, and hence is somebody that I might be able to contact via direct messages.</p>
<p>But a really useful example is that my dog, Cleo, has a Twitter account. And every time she goes to the vet, she tweets a selfie and with her selfie she tweets how much she weighs. So she'll tweet "I weigh 42.5 pounds. I grew a little bit more dog". Because she tweets this and I've got this coming into Dogsheep I now have these in a SQL database - so I can construct a SQL query that looks for tweets that mentioned her weight. And I can use <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-rure">a regular expression</a> to extract that weight value out as the thing before the LB. And then I can use my charting plugin to plot that as a chart. So I now have a chart of Cleo's weight over time, as reported by her posting selfies at the vet. It's like having the kind of data warehouse you get at a giant corporation, but just against your own data, and costing about $5 a month in hosting fees.</p>
<p>So that's tweets. But there was so much more stuff in here. I'm running dozens and dozens of projects on GitHub, and I pull all of the issues, issue comments, commits and releases into my one database.</p>
<p>So here I have a table of all 7,000 commits that I've made on GitHub across all of these different project so I can search these in one place, I can evaluate them, I can compare commits across different projects and I can also do charting. So here's a graph that's constructed by a custom SQL query, which pulls out just the date of each commit, groups by them and sticks on a count. So these are my commits over time as a chart.</p>
<p>A key philosophy of Datasette is everything should have a URL. So once I've constructed this query and put it on a chart, I can bookmark that page right there and that becomes, essentially, the application encoded in a URL that I can bookmark and link to and visit later on.</p>
<p>I've got a copy of my genome. I did <a href="https://www.23andme.com/">23AndMe</a> a few years ago, and I found out recently that they have an export button and you can export your genome out as a CSV file. So I did that. I now have a copy of the 600,000 rows of my genome that 23AndMe keep track of. Which means I can use SQL queries to analyse my own genome. I have a query here that tells me what colour my eyes are based on running this query against my genome - apparently my eyes are blue 99% of the time because I have a GG genotype in this particular location on my genome.</p>
<p>This took an entire weekend figure out. I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2019/Oct/21/weeknotes-squirrels-genome/">went to Science Hack Day</a> and borrowed a geneticist so I could see if I could figure out some homebrew genetic explorations.</p>
<p>I mentioned the Apple Watch earlier. Apple record an incredible amount of data about me and they don't uploaded to the cloud - an interesting thing about Apple is they keep that stuff on your device. So if you dig around in the HealthKit app on the iPhone, there's an export button that will give you that data back out again. And I <a href="https://datasette.io/tools/healthkit-to-sqlite">wrote code to turn that into SQLite</a> and there was an enormous quantity of data in here. I've got standing time and basal energy burned, my body mass over time reported by my Withing scales, headphone audio exposure is something that showed up last year, the number of flights of steps I climbed, all sorts of stuff</p>
<p>But the most interesting one is workouts because every time you track a workout using your Apple Watch, it goes in the database. And if it's an outdoor workout - where you're, say, going for a run, it records your GPS location every few seconds. I ran the Bay To Breakers race in San Francisco a couple of years ago and beecause of that, I've got a database table with my location tracked route. It's 3,800 points, and I can plot that on a map and see the exact, finely grained route I took through San Francisco when I ran Bay To Brakers just over three years ago.</p>
<p>It's kind of amazing to me that this stuff is just sat there on our devices waiting for us to liberate it and start using it to build these visualisations and learn interesting things about ourselves.</p>
<p>I also mentioned earlier on Apple Photos. Apple Photos databases are absolutely fascinating because it turns out Apple run machine learning models on your phone to figure out what you took photographs of. And this means I can do things like run a SQL query that shows me <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/May/21/dogsheep-photos/">all of the photographs that I've taken of a pelican</a>.</p>
<p>My personal Dogsheep right here shows me these pictures - these are Apple Photos I took where Apple itself has labelled them as pelican.</p>
<p>And even more fun than that is Apple calculates scores for your photos. These are hidden away in the SQLite database. And they have names like Z Overall Aesthetic Score or Z Harmonious Colour Score or Z Pleasant Camera Tilt Score. So this query here isn't just showing me photographs I've taken of pelicans - it's sorting them by the most aesthetically pleasing according to Apple's classification algorithm that they're running on my device.</p>
<p>I can show you the Pelican photo with the most pleasant camera tilt - there's so much fun stuff you can do digging into all of this.</p>
<p>So I've been building this set of Dogsheep tools for about a year now, but the thing I always want to do was to tie them all together. I wanted to build that personal search engine.</p>
<p>And a couple of weeks ago, I finally got it working.</p>
<p>I've called it <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/dogsheep-beta">Dogsheep Beta</a> because Stephen Wolfram's search engine is called <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/">Wolfram Alpha</a>. So I figured Dogsheep Beta was definitely the appropriate name for it.</p>
<p>And so this right here is Dogsheep Beta, and it lets me run searches across my tweets, my photos, my GitHub commits, issue comments, releases, comments I made on Hacker News - all in one place.</p>
<p>And so if I search for example, for "cleopaws costume", I will see all of the tweets by my dog, whose Twitter handle is @Cleopaws where she's tweeting about her costumes. I think she makes <a href="https://twitter.com/Cleopaws/status/894322673525837824">a particularly fetching pirate</a>.</p>
<p>Or again, I can search for PyGotham and I get back not just not just tweets, but I get back issue comments from my personal issues where I've been tracking the fact that I need to submit a talk.</p>
<p>Again, this is a custom search interface, but really all this is under the hood is SQLite - it's a SQLite database with a table that acts as a search index and I'm running queries using SQLite's built-in full text search mechanism.</p>
<p>If any of this has caught your interest, all of this is aggressively open source. So if you go to <a href="https://dogsheep.github.io/">dogsheep.github.io</a> this is an index page for all of the Dogsheep project. Click through to <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette">the GitHub Datasette repository</a> and I've got very <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/">extensive documentation</a> covering Datasette, what it can do, the plugins available and how to write plugins of your own.</p>
<p>And really, my goal with this project is I want to build a growing ecosystem of not just Datasette plugins, but tools for getting data from all of these different sources and loading them into SQLite databases so that we can join them together and use them to find out interesting things about the world and about our own lives.</p>
<p>If this has piqued your interest, please drop by the project. We have <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/discussions">a GitHub discussions board</a> which you're welcome to join.</p>
<p>[I hadn't launched the full website when I gave this talk, but today I'd encourage you to explore <a href="https://datasette.io/">datasette.io</a>]</p>

<p>Suppose you’re a member of a team that runs a public web service. You need to help both internal and external users make sense of all the data that’s recorded as it runs. That’s been my role for the past few years, now it’s time to summarize what I’ve learned.</p>
<p>The web service featured in this case study is the Hypothesis web annotation system. The primary database, Postgres, stores information about users, groups, documents, courses, and annotations. Questions that our team needs to answer include:</p>
<p>– How many students created annotations last semester?</p>
<p>– In how many courses at each school?</p>
<p>Questions from instructors using Hypothesis in their courses include:</p>
<p>– Which passages in course readings are attracting highlights and discussion?</p>
<p>– Who is asking questions about those passages, and who is responding?</p>
<p>Early on we adopted a tool called Metabase that continues to be a pillar of our analytics system. When Metabase was hooked up to our Postgres database the team could start asking questions without leaning on developers. Some folks used the interactive query builder, while others went straight to writing SQL that Metabase passes through to Postgres.</p>
<p>Before long we had a large catalog of Metabase questions that query Postgres and display results as tables or charts that can be usefully arranged on Metabase dashboards. It’s all nicely RESTful. Interactive elements that can parameterize queries, like search boxes and date pickers, map to URLs. Queries can emit URLs in order to compose themselves with other queries. I came to see this system as a kind of lightweight application server in which to incubate an analytics capability that could later be expressed more richly.</p>
<p>Over time, and with growing amounts of data, early success with this approach gave way to two kinds of frustration: queries began to choke, and the catalog of Metabase questions became unmanageable. And so, in the time-honored tradition, we set up a data warehouse for analytics. Ours is another instance of Postgres that syncs nightly with the primary database. There are lots of other ways to skin the cat but it made sense to leverage ops experience with Postgres and I had a hunch that it would do well in this role.</p>
<p>To unthrottle the choking queries I began building materialized views that cache the results of Postgres queries. Suppose a query makes use of available indexes but still takes a few minutes, or maybe even an hour, to run. It still takes that long to build the corresponding materialized view, but once built other queries can use its results immediately. Metabase questions that formerly included chunks of SQL began reducing to select * from {viewname}.</p>
<p>This process continues to unfold in a highly productive way. Team members may or may not hit a performance wall as they try to use Metabase to answer their questions. When they do, we can convert the SQL text of a Metabase question to a Postgres materialized view that gets immediate results. Such views can join with others, and/or with underlying tables, in SQL SELECT contexts. The views become nouns in a language that expresses higher-order business concepts.</p>
<p>The verbs in this language turned out to be Postgres functions written in the native procedural language, pl/pgsql, and later also in its Python counterpart, pl/python. Either flavor can augment built-in Postgres library functions with user-defined functions that can return simple values, like numbers and strings, but can also return sets that behave in SQL SELECT contexts just like tables and views.</p>
<p>Functions were, at first, a way to reuse chunks of SQL that otherwise had to be duplicated across Metabase questions and Postgres CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW statements. That made it possible to streamline and refactor both bodies of code and sanely maintain them.</p>
<p>To visualize what had now become a three-body system of sources in which Metabase questions, Postgres views, and Postgres functions can call (or link to) one another, I wrote a tool that builds a crosslinked concordance. That made it practical to reason effectively about the combined system.</p>
<p>Along the way I have learned how Postgres, and more broadly <a href="https://modern-sql.com/">modern SQL</a>, in conjunction with a tool like Metabase, can enable a team like ours to make sense of data. There’s plenty to say about the techniques I’ve evolved, and I aim to write them up over time. The details won’t interest most people, but here’s an outcome that might be noteworthy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Team member: I had an idea that will help manage our communication with customers, and I’ve prototyped it in a Metabase question.</p>
<p>Toolsmith: Great! Here’s a Postgres function that encapsulates and refines your SQL. It’s fast enough for now, but if needed we can convert it into a materialized view. Now you can use that function in another Metabase question that projects your SQL across a set of customers that you can select.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That interaction forms the basis of a virtuous cycle: The team member formulates a question and does their best to answer it using Metabase; the toolsmith captures the intent and re-expresses it in a higher-level business language; the expanded language enables the team member to go farther in a next cycle.</p>
<p>We recognize this software pattern in the way application programmers who push a system to its limits induce systems programmers to respond with APIs that expand those limits. I suppose it’s harder to see when the application environment is Metabase and the systems environment is Postgres. But it’s the same pattern, and it is powerful.</p>

  <p>Work on Project Pelican inspires new features and improvements across a number of different projects.</p>
<p>Project Pelican is an upcoming collaborative data release I'm working on with an embargo - hence the code name. It involves around 700MB of CSV data converted to SQLite, which has lead to some small but notable improvements in several of my tools.</p>
 Datasette 0.58 and 0.58.1 
<p>I published <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Jul/16/datasette-058/">annotated release notes</a> for Datasette 0.58 last week. In addition to several plugin hooks improvement the big improvement was a 10x performance improvement to Datasette facets, which was discovered during work on Project Pelican. Conversations about this on the SQLite Forum lead to a new optimization by D. Richard Hipp <a href="https://sqlite.org/forum/forumpost/878ca7a9be0862af?t=h">landing in SQLite trunk</a>!</p>
<p>I release <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-58-1">Datasette 0.58.1</a> shortly afterwards with a fix for a <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1231">rare intermittent race condition</a> that I introduced back in January.</p>
 sqlite-transform 1.0 and 1.1 
<p>The data I am working with for Project Pelican has a confusing characteristic: some of the columns contain integers almost consistently, but have a few rows that contain text: a <code>-</code> character, or a number with commas like <code>1,232</code> or a string such as <code>&gt;40</code>).</p>
<p>I decided to address this by adding more columns - the original column with a <code>_int</code> suffix of type <code>integer</code> containing just the number, if one is available. So if the column was called <code>total</code> there would be a <code>total_int</code> integer column reflecting its value.</p>
<p>My <a href="https://datasette.io/tools/sqlite-transform">sqlite-transform tool</a> could almost do this: it has a <code>lambda</code> command that lets you execute Python code against every value in a column to convert it in some way.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-transform/releases/tag/1.0">sqlite-transform 1.0</a> I added the ability to write that converted value to a different output column - so now I can do this:</p>
 <code>sqlite-transform lambda project-pelican.db \
  sometable total \
    --code '
if (
    value.isdigit() or
    value.replace(",", "").isdigit()
    or value.startswith("&lt;"):
    return int(value.replace(",", "").replace("&lt;", ""))
' --output total_int --output-type integer
</code> 
<p>This command-line script compiles the Python code in <code>--code</code> once and then executes it against every value in the <code>total</code> column. The return value is written to the newly created <code>total_int</code> column.</p>
<p>Under the hood this works by defining a custom SQLite function called <code>transform()</code> using the compiled Python code, then executing the SQL equivalent of the following:</p>
 <code>update sometable set total_int = transform(total)
</code> 
<p>The Python function tracks how many times it has been called and uses that to update a progress bar using the <a href="https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm">tqdm</a> Python library.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-transform/releases/tag/1.1">sqlite-transform 1.1</a> added a <code>--silent</code> option to disable that progress bar, because when I ran it in GitHub Actions the progress bar output turned into too many separate lines of text.</p>
 conditional-get 0.3 
<p>The Project Pelican Datasette instance is built by GitHub Actions, which starts by downloading a 700MB CSV file.</p>
<p>I decided to use the GitHub Actions cache in conjunction with a conditional HTTP GET request to avoid downloading the CSV file if it hadn't changed since the last time the action ran.</p>
<p>My <a href="https://github.com/simonw/conditional-get">conditional-get</a> tool can help here: it downloads files but stores their <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/ETag">ETag</a> in a JSON file, then on subsequent requests it uses that ETag to perform a conditional GET and avoids downloading the content of the target URL if it has not changed since last time.</p>
<p>One catch though: the CSV files for Project Pelican live in Google Cloud Storage and are protected by a signed URL. The JSON file used the full URL as the key to lookup an ETag, so if the URL has changed (due to a fresh signature) the tool would not be able to find the correct ETag.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/simonw/conditional-get/releases/tag/0.3">conditional-get 0.3</a> fixes that with a new <code>--key</code> option that can be used to specify a custom key within the JSON file to store the ETag. So now my GitHub Action script partially looks like this:</p>

  conditional-get --etags $download_dir/etags.json \

 datasette-graphql 1.5 
<p>Unrelated to Project Pelican (despite that project making calls to a separate GraphQL API): <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/releases/tag/1.5">datasette-graphql 1.5</a> finally closed an issue that had <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/issues/61">been open for a while</a>: switching internal API calls over to using <code>datasette.client</code>.</p>
<p>Datasette exposes two key documented APIs: there's the <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/json_api.html">HTTP/JSON API</a> that can be used to query and introspect Datasette over the network, and there's the <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/internals.html">internal Python API</a> which allows plugins to interact with the rest of Datasette.</p>
<p>Last year I realized that there are often times when a plugin might wish to access that same JSON API that is exposed by Datasette to the public.</p>
<p>Datasette uses ASGI internally, and the HTTPX Python library has a mechanism for executing requests directly against a Python ASGI interface without using the network... so I combined the two and introduced <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/datasette-0-50/#datasette-client">the datasette.client interface</a> for making calls from within Datasette to its own HTTP API.</p>
<p>My <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/dogsheep-beta">dogsheep-beta search plugin</a> was the first to take advantage of this: it <a href="https://github.com/dogsheep/dogsheep-beta/blob/0.10.2/dogsheep_beta/__init__.py#L223-L230">uses that mechanism</a> to make internal API calls to calculate facet counts without re-implementing faceting.</p>
<p><code>datasette-graphql</code> exposes a GraphQL API over Datasette tables, including the ability to apply filters (rows where age &gt; 25 etc). It does this by translating GraphQL field requests into calls to the Datasette table JSON API.</p>
<p>This used to work with some inelegant hijacking of Datasette's undocumented internal view classes, which made me nervous because it meant that the GraphQL plugin would break any time I modified Datasette core.</p>
<p>In 1.5 I <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/commit/289484d9dc40faa76dbd9af24786b3069cb6a75f#diff-e7e272f15568ba13579f704f3832581debbd2ef46ba1d385edacb9c85b172c26L602">switched it over</a> to using the <code>datasette.client</code> mechanism instead, which should be a much more stable target since changes to Datasette's JSON API are made in a much more controlled fashion.</p>
<p>In writing the tests for this I ran into the race condition mentioned above - so releasing this plugin ended up being the trigger for pushing out the Datasette 0.58.1 release with that fix.</p>

<p>今日、故あって、銀座のエルメス・ギャラリーでやっているマチュウ・コプランによる展覧会「エキシビジョン・カッティングス」<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2021/07/4810/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-4810" title="Le Forum「エキシビジョン・カッティングス」<br>マチュウ・コプランによる展覧会&amp;#8221;Exhibition Cuttings&amp;#8221; An exhibition by Mathieu Copeland　2021.4.23（金）～7.31（土）<a href=&quot;https://www.hermes.com/jp/ja/story/maison-ginza/forum/210423/&quot;>https://www.hermes.com/jp/ja/story/maison-ginza/forum/210423/</a>">1</a>に行ってきました。アートシーンには全く疎いのですが、前回の東京オリンピックの1964年というと、日本は世界をリードしてたころでなんですね。</p>



<p>大パノラマ展とか<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2021/07/4810/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-4810" title="検索してもあんまり良い情報が出てこないので、「エキシビジョン・カッティングス」に行くのおすすめです。これに続く一連の世界での動きと合わせて勉強できます。ところで、ヨーコ・オノってすごかったんですね。">2</a></p>



<p>普通は画廊での個展は初日は華やかにレセプションとかあるものですが、これは画廊を封鎖して始まり、個展の終わりに封鎖を解いて祝って終わるという反展覧会 Anti-Exhabition。それに続く世界各地でのアートの商業化に対するアンチテーゼの動きを見て、色々考えるところがありました。</p>



<p>それの一つが、あり得たもう一つのオリンピック開会式。</p>



<p>コロナでロックダウンの時期だったんだから、それにふさわしく反開会式 Anti-Opening にして、選手は誰も入場せず、オリンピック村の自室のバルコニーにソーシャルディスタンスで並び、国立競技場にはバッハ会長他オリンピック貴族と関係者だけがいるのをずっと画面半分でTV中継、もう半分ではドローンで宿舎バルコニーを国別に写して回る。音楽はケージの4分33秒でコロナでなくなった方々と、「復興五輪」なんだから10年前の震災で亡くなった方々に黙祷を捧げる。後者に関しては、復興の現状を包み隠さず写す。</p>



<p>オリンピックの最中は、IOC貴族たちにカメラが密着。東京オリンピックとしてのアートタッチのドキュメンタリーを残す。</p>



<p>選手たちが一同に会すのはもちろん閉会式の最後までお預けです。残った人たちだけですが。残らなかった人たちは大スクリーンでバーチャル参加ですね。</p>



<p>最後の最後に誰か象徴的な人（誰が良いですかね）がオリンピック貴族たちを排除してアスリートたちが集まり、商業主義との決別を宣言<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2021/07/4810/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-4810" title="スポーツ団体の資金源がこのへんだから無理は重々承知ですが。">3</a>するとか。LAオリンピック以来ずっとではありますが、今回は特にこれだけ商業主義とアテンションエコノミーの暗黒を見せつけている<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2021/07/4810/#easy-footnote-bottom-4-4810" title="小山田圭吾問題とかのぶみ問題とか、アテンションを取れる人を選ぶという広告代理店的思考ですよね">4</a>オリンピックなのでちょっと妄想してみました。</p>The post <a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2021/07/4810/">あり得たもう一つのオリンピック開会式</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.sakimura.org">@_Nat Zone</a>.

<p>The WorkerServiceBus class implements the IHostedService  interface and uses the IServiceBusTopicSubscription interface to subscribe to an Azure Service Bus topic. The StartAsync method is used to register the subscription using the RegisterOnMessageHandlerAndReceiveMessages method.  The interface provides a start, and stop and a dispose. The Azure Service Bus class is controlled using this hosted service. If needed, a periodic task could be implemented to run health checks on the client or whatever.</p>


  public class WorkerServiceBus : IHostedService, IDisposable
{
	private readonly ILogger&lt;WorkerServiceBus&gt; _logger;
	private readonly IServiceBusConsumer _serviceBusConsumer;
	private readonly IServiceBusTopicSubscription _serviceBusTopicSubscription;

	public WorkerServiceBus(IServiceBusConsumer serviceBusConsumer,
		IServiceBusTopicSubscription serviceBusTopicSubscription,
		ILogger&lt;WorkerServiceBus&gt; logger)
	{
		_serviceBusConsumer = serviceBusConsumer;
		_serviceBusTopicSubscription = serviceBusTopicSubscription;
		_logger = logger;
	}

	public async Task StartAsync(CancellationToken stoppingToken)
	{
		_logger.LogDebug("Starting the service bus queue consumer and the subscription");
		await _serviceBusConsumer.RegisterOnMessageHandlerAndReceiveMessages().ConfigureAwait(false);
		await _serviceBusTopicSubscription.PrepareFiltersAndHandleMessages().ConfigureAwait(false);
	}

	public async Task StopAsync(CancellationToken stoppingToken)
	{
		_logger.LogDebug("Stopping the service bus queue consumer and the subscription");
		await _serviceBusConsumer.CloseQueueAsync().ConfigureAwait(false);
		await _serviceBusTopicSubscription.CloseSubscriptionAsync().ConfigureAwait(false);
	}

	public void Dispose()
	{
		Dispose(true);
		GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
	}

	protected virtual async void Dispose(bool disposing)
	{
		if (disposing)
		{
			await _serviceBusConsumer.DisposeAsync().ConfigureAwait(false);
			await _serviceBusTopicSubscription.DisposeAsync().ConfigureAwait(false);
		}
	}
}
  


<p>The IHostedService is added to the services in the ConfigureServices method. The AddHostedService is used to initialize this. Now the Azure Service bus subscription can be managed and consume messages from the topic subscription or a queue is used.</p>


  public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
	services.AddControllers();

	var connection = Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection");

	services.AddDbContext&lt;PayloadContext&gt;(options =&gt;
		options.UseSqlite(connection));

	services.AddSingleton&lt;IServiceBusConsumer, ServiceBusConsumer&gt;();
	services.AddSingleton&lt;IServiceBusTopicSubscription, ServiceBusTopicSubscription&gt;();
	services.AddSingleton&lt;IProcessData, ProcessData&gt;();

	services.AddHostedService&lt;WorkerServiceBus&gt;();

	services.AddSwaggerGen(c =&gt;
	{
		c.SwaggerDoc("v1", new OpenApiInfo
		{
			Version = "v1",
			Title = "Payload API",
		});
	});
}
  


<p>When the application is run, the messages can be sent to the topic and are received using the IHostedService Azure Service Bus subscription.</p>

 toyDB is a "distributed SQL database in Rust, written as a learning project", with its own implementations of SQL, raft, ACID transactions, B+trees and more. toyDB author Erik Grinaker has assembled a detailed set of references that he used to learn how to build a database - I'd love to see more projects do this, it's really useful.

  <p>I've spent nearly twenty years blogging, giving talks and releasing open source code. It's been fantastic for my career, and a huge amount of work. But here's a useful secret: you don't have to put very much work at all into public creativity in order to stand out as a job candidate.</p>
<p>I've interviewed hundreds of people, and screened hundreds more resumes - mostly for tech roles in San Francisco, an extremely competitive job market.</p>
<p>The vast majority of candidates have little to no evidence of creativity in public at all. The same is true for many of the best engineers I have worked with.</p>
<p>As a hiring manager, this means you have to learn how to source candidates and interview effectively: you don't want to miss out on a great engineer just because they spent all of their energy making great products for prior employers rather than blogging, speaking and coding in public.</p>
<p>But as a candidate, this means you can give yourself a big advantage in terms of standing out from the crowd with a relatively small amount of work.</p>
<p>Start a blog. Post an interesting technical article to it once or twice a year - something you've learned, or a bug you've fixed, or a problem you've solved. After a few years stop bothering entirely, but leave the blog online somewhere.</p>
<p>Build a small personal project and put the code on GitHub. Accompany it with a README with a detailed description of the project and screenshots of it in action - almost no-one does this, it only takes a few hours extra and it massively increases the impact your project will have on hiring managers who are checking you out.</p>
<p>That's it. One or two blog posts. Maybe a GitHub repository. Believe it or not, if you are up against a bunch of other candidates (especially earlier on in your career) they likely won't have anything like that. You will jump straight to the top of the hiring manager's mental list, maybe without them even noticing.</p>
<p>There's plenty more you can do if you want to put the effort in: build an audience on Twitter, start a newsletter, make videos, give talks (ideally that get recorded and published online), release open source packages, publish <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/">TILs</a> - but honestly if your goal is to get through the interview process more easily you will very quickly hit the law of diminishing returns.</p>
<p>If you're going to do that stuff do it because you want to develop those skills and share with and learn from the world - don't just do it because you think it's a critical path to being hired.</p>
<p>This post started out as a Twitter thread:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you want to stand out from other candidates, having even one piece of writing or published piece of code that shows something you've built is a great way to do that <a href="https://t.co/QfYEWxfIet">https://t.co/QfYEWxfIet</a></p>- Simon Willison (@simonw) <a href="https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1416459997966266368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 17, 2021</a></blockquote>

‘hexadaisy layout’ by Darla available at <a href="https://flic.kr/p/e6MH6e">http://www.flickr.com/photos/pedrosz/2040577615</a> under a Attribution 2.0 Generic (CC BY 2.0)&nbsp;license<p>When Open Badges was kicking off ten years ago (<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/images/5/59/OpenBadges-Working-Paper_012312.pdf">see the original white paper</a>), it was conceived to be a recognition infrastructure for skills attained and achievements accomplished anywhere at any time. Badges could assert skills learned informally, formally, really in any aspect of and through life. It was hoped that recruiters, employers, and others could evaluate the badges to find people who had skills that aligned with the opportunities being offered. It was envisioned they could work like other types of credentials such as degrees and certifications, “but with room for much more granular or diverse skill representation” and available opportunities to capture these&nbsp;skills.</p><p>The infrastructure for this type of recognition system was a format called a digital badge. More than just a digital sticker, the badges would be filled with metadata properties describing the skills and achievements. Then the badges could convey the metadata both as human readable and machine readable content. By having a standard to describe the metadata and how it would be verified, Open Badges became usable in many technologies and contexts. For the most part, this resulted in badges being shared online on issuing platforms and social media — more as a tool for human understanding than one that took full advantage of the potential for machine readability.</p><p>Since then, the ethos of Open Badges, recognizing skills anywhere and anytime, has strengthened. Growth has accelerated, especially in the past few years. IMS Global and Credential Engine’s <a href="http://content.imsglobal.org/badge-count-2020/badge-count-2020/">Badge Count 2020 Report</a> indicated that there’d been an 80% increase in issued badges since 2018. Its use has expanded into more formal institutional contexts, the metadata have evolved, and initiatives have risen around it including the <a href="https://www.openrecognition.org/">Open Recognition Alliance</a>, <a href="https://www.thebadgesummit.com/">Badge Summit</a>, and the <a href="https://www.openskillsnetwork.org/">Open Skills&nbsp;Network</a>.</p><p>Over the years, internet technologies have evolved too and a credential verification model at the W3C called <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> has gained traction. This verification model can be used for any type of credential including passports, drivers licenses, and educational credentials like Open Badges. In fact, members of the Open Badges community helped to write the very first <a href="https://opencreds.org/specs/source/use-cases/">use cases</a> for Verifiable Credentials back in 2018. This was because we knew then that if Open Badges data were to be trusted by apps, they not only needed to be readable by machines, they needed to be verifiable.</p><p>The Verifiable Credential model can provide security and privacy enhancements not yet available to Open Badges. This model gives learners persistent access to their badges increasing the longevity and resilience of credentials that were intended to promote and support lifelong learning. A more secure and universally supported verification model such as Verifiable Credentials enables Open Badges to become the personal skills currency it was originally envisioned to&nbsp;be.</p><p><a href="https://concentricsky.com/">Concentric Sky</a> (<a href="https://info.badgr.com/">Badgr</a>) has offered a <a href="https://github.com/concentricsky/openbadges-specification/blob/feature/ob3/proposals/OBv3p0/Proposal-Open-Badges-3.0.pdf">proposal for a new version of Open Badges</a> that explains what is needed to make it work within the Verifiable Credentials model. The use cases in the proposal provide scenarios where Open Badges are earned and then how they are exchanged. In one use case, a medical professional is able to start her new job sooner because her CME’s can be quickly verified:</p><p>Verifying Continuing Ed: Denise was offered a new job at a hospital as a physician assistant. Before starting, her continuing education training and license to practice needed to be verified. The last time she switched hospitals, the verification process took three weeks. This time, she was able to provide her badges to prove her training and license. Within minutes her credentials were verified and she was issued a new digital staff credential</p><p>In another use case, a career change is facilitated by using verifiable Open Badges to map skills to&nbsp;jobs:</p><p>Mapping Skills: Sid is shifting careers after many years working in construction. In his digital wallet he had several skill badges describing his mastery of several skills in construction but also in teamwork, communication, and organizational skills. Sid also had badges from some courses he’d taken in science and math over the last few years. After he uploaded the skill and course badges from his wallet to a career planning site, he was offered several opportunities to apply for work in software sales and cybersecurity.</p><p>Here’s an example of how an Open Badge as a Verifiable Credential (Open Badges 3.0) exchange could&nbsp;work:</p>  A learner connects to a badge issuing platform with their digital wallet app on their phone or&nbsp;laptop.  Once authenticated, the issuer provides the badge to the learner who puts it in their wallet. The badge data contains cryptographic proof that identifies the issuer and the&nbsp;learner.  A job employment app asks for proof that the applicant has experience with a requirement needed for that&nbsp;role.  The learner presents the job employment app with the badge using the digital wallet app. The job employment app can then verify<br>a. that the learner providing the badge is the recipient of that badge<br>b. that the issuer is the identity that issued the badge, and<br>c. that the badge data has not changed since it was&nbsp;issued.  The verifier responds that the badge is authentic.  <p>In comparison, here’s an Open Badges 2.0&nbsp;flow:</p>  A learner or an organization provides an issuer app with the learner’s email&nbsp;address  The Issuer generates badge data that includes the email address as the recipient identity and sends the earner the badge (typically as a link to a web&nbsp;page)  The earner can share the link on social media, or perhaps with a potential employer or a job application app.  The badge is verified by either<br>a. a human looking at the web page where the badge is hosted or<br>b. the application attempts to retrieve the badge data from a url hosted by the&nbsp;issuer.  <p>The Open Badges 2.0 example depends on the issuer hosting the data and relies on an email address for the learner. The Open Badges 3.0 example is self-contained and doesn’t require the issuer to continue to retain a web hosting provider in order for the credential to remain valid. Instead it uses cryptographic proof to authenticate the badge, the issuer, as well as the learner who earned it. With either example, the learner has a way to proudly share their achievement online but the Open Badges 3.0 method doesn’t rely on that online presence for verification. In fact, the original issuer may no longer exist, but the achievements can still be verified.</p><p>On Monday July 19, we’ll be reviewing the <a href="https://github.com/concentricsky/openbadges-specification/blob/feature/ob3/proposals/OBv3p0/Proposal-Open-Badges-3.0.pdf">Open Badges 3.0 proposal</a> and anyone is invited to join us to learn more. Here’s the meeting&nbsp;info:</p><p>Monday, July 19, 2021<br>Time: 8am PDT / 11am EDT / 4pm BST, 5pm CEST<br>Jitsi Web Conference: <a href="https://meet.w3c-ccg.org/education">https://meet.w3c-ccg.org/education</a><br>US phone: tel:+1.602.932.2243;3</p><p>On Thursday, July 22, Concentric Sky will be presenting this proposal to the IMS Global Open Badges working group to seek the members’ go-ahead to move forward on the work to make Open Badges 3.0 a reality.

  <p>I released <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-58">Datasette 0.58</a> last night, with new plugin hooks, Unix domain socket support, a major faceting performance fix and a few other improvements. Here are the <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/annotatedreleasenotes/">annotated release notes</a>.</p>
 Faceting performance improvement 
<p><a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/facets.html">Facets</a> remains my favourite feature in Datasette: it turns out a simple group by / count against a column is one of the most productive ways I know of to start understanding new data.</p>
<p>Yesterday I stumbled across <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/commit/a6c8e7fa4cffdeff84e9e755dcff4788fd6154b8">a tiny tweak</a> (details in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1394">this issue</a>) that gave me a 10x performance boost on facet queries! Short version: given the following example query:</p>
  select
  country_long,
  count(*)
from (
  select * from [global-power-plants]
  order by rowid
)
where
  country_long is not null
group by
  country_long
order by
  count(*) desc  
<p>Removing the unnecessary <code>order by rowid</code> from that inner query knocked the time down from 53ms to 7.2ms (and makes even more of a difference on larger tables).</p>
<p>I was surprised SQLite didn't perform that optimization automatically - so I <a href="https://sqlite.org/forum/forumpost/2d76f2bcf65d256a">started a thread</a> on the SQLite forum and SQLite author D. Richard Hipp <a href="https://sqlite.org/src/timeline?r=omit-subquery-order-by">figured out a patch</a>! It's not yet certain that it will land in a SQLite release but I'm excited to have found an issue interesting enough to be worth looking into. (UPDATE: it <a href="https://sqlite.org/forum/forumpost/878ca7a9be0862af?t=h">landed on trunk</a>).</p>
 The get_metadata() plugin hook 
<blockquote>
<p>New plugin hook: <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/plugin_hooks.html#plugin-hook-get-metadata">get_metadata(datasette, key, database, table)</a>, for returning custom metadata for an instance, database or table. Thanks, Brandon Roberts! (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1384">#1384</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brandon Roberts contributed this hook as part of work he's been doing with <a href="https://next.newsday.com/">Newsday nextLI</a> - always exciting to see Datasette used by another news organization. Brandon has <a href="https://datasette-live.bxroberts.org/">a live demo</a> of the plugins he has been building: <a href="https://github.com/next-LI/datasette-live-config">datasette-live-config</a>, <a href="https://github.com/next-LI/datasette-live-permissions">datasette-live-permissions</a>, <a href="https://github.com/next-LI/datasette-csv-importer">datasette-csv-importer</a> and <a href="https://github.com/next-LI/datasette-surveys">datasette-surveys</a>. He also has a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SShy_C6-CSUlSaqyQSIlUDIa4WA9YzTr/view">6 minute demo video</a> explaining the project so far.</p>
<p>The new hook allows plugins to customize the <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/metadata.html#metadata">metadata</a> displayed for different databases and tables within the Datasette interface.</p>
<p>There is one catch at the moment: the plugin doesn't yet allow for async calls (including <code>await db.execute(sql)</code>) because Datasette's own internals currently treat access to metadata as a sync rather than async feature.</p>
<p>There are workarounds for this. Brandon's <code>datasette-live-config</code> plugin <a href="https://github.com/next-LI/datasette-live-config/blob/d7e39db50f33b78ec0ef3f404ba421c4a47a5844/datasette_live_config/__init__.py">opens an additional, synchronous connection</a> to the DB which is completely fine for fast queries. Another option would be to keep metadata in an in-memory Python dictionary which is updated by SQL queries that run in an async background task.</p>
<p>In the longer run though I'd like to redesign Datasette's internals to support asynchronous metadata access - ideally before Datasette 1.0.</p>
 The skip_csrf() plugin hook 
<blockquote>
<p>New plugin hook: <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/plugin_hooks.html#plugin-hook-skip-csrf">skip_csrf(datasette, scope)</a>, for opting out of CSRF protection based on the incoming request. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1377">#1377</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wanted to write a plugin that supported an HTTP POST to a Datasette form that wasn't protected by Datasette's <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/internals.html?highlight=csrf#csrf-protection">CSRF protection</a>. This proved surprisingly difficult! I ended up shipping <a href="https://github.com/simonw/asgi-csrf/releases/tag/0.9">asgi-csrf 0.9</a> with a new mechanism for custom opting-out of CSRF protection based on the ASGI scope, then exposing that mechanism in a new plugin hook in Datasette.</p>
<p>CSRF is such a frustrating security issue to write code against, because in modern browsers the SameSite cookie attribute more-or-less solves the problem for you... but that attribute only has <a href="https://caniuse.com/same-site-cookie-attribute">90% global usage according to caniuse.com</a> - not quite enough for me to forget about it entirely.</p>
<p>There also remains <a href="https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1413484080226717708">one obscure edge-case</a> in which SameSite won't help you: the definition of "same site" includes other subdomains of your domain (provided it's not on the <a href="https://github.com/publicsuffix/list">Public Suffix List</a>). This means that for SameSite CSRF protection to work you need to be confident that no subdomains of your domain will suffer an XSS - and in my experience its common for subdomains to be pointed at third-party applications that may not have the same stringent XSS protection as your main code.</p>
<p>So I continue to care about CSRF protection in Datasette.</p>
 Unix domain socket support 
<blockquote>
<p>New <code>datasette --uds /tmp/datasette.sock</code> option for binding Datasette to a Unix domain socket, see <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/deploying.html#deploying-proxy">proxy documentation</a>. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1388">#1388</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wrote about this <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Jul/13/unix-domain-sockets/">in my weeknotes</a> - this is a great way to run Datasette if you have it behind a proxy such as Apache or nginx and don't want to have the Datasette server listening on a high port.</p>
 "searchmode": "raw" in table metadata 
<blockquote>
<p><code>"searchmode": "raw"</code> table metadata option for defaulting a table to executing SQLite full-text search syntax without first escaping it, see <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/full_text_search.html#full-text-search-advanced-queries">Advanced SQLite search queries</a>. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1389">#1389</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>SQLite's built in full-text search feature includes support <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/fts5.html#full_text_query_syntax">for advanced operators</a>: you can use operators like AND, OR and NEAR and you can add column specifiers like <code>name:Simon</code> to restrict searches to individual columns.</p>
<p>This is something of a two-edged sword: I've found innocent looking queries that raise errors due to unexpected interactions with the query language.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/651">issue 651</a> I switched to escaping all queries by default to prevent these errors from happening, with a <code>?_searchmode=raw</code> query string option for opting back into the default functionality.</p>
<p>I've since had a few requests for a mechanism to enable this by default - hence the new <code>"searchmode": "raw"</code> option in table metadata.</p>
 Link plugin hooks now take a request 
<blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/plugin_hooks.html#plugin-hook-menu-links">menu_links()</a>, <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/plugin_hooks.html#plugin-hook-table-actions">table_actions()</a> and <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/plugin_hooks.html#plugin-hook-database-actions">database_actions()</a> plugin hooks all gained a new optional <code>request</code> argument providing access to the current request. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1371">#1371</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have a plugin which needs to add links to different places depending on the subdomain that the Datasette instance is running on. Adding <code>request</code> to these plugin hooks proved to be the easiest way to achieve this.</p>
<p>This is a really nice thing about how <a href="https://pluggy.readthedocs.io/">Pluggy</a> (the plugin library used by Datasette) works: adding new named parameters to hooks can be done without breaking backwards compatibility with existing plugins.</p>
 And the rest 
 
 Improved documentation for <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/deploying.html#deploying-proxy">Running Datasette behind a proxy</a> to recommend using <code>ProxyPreservehost On</code> with Apache. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1387">#1387</a>) 
 
<code>POST</code> requests to endpoints that do not support that HTTP verb now return a 405 error. 
 
<code>db.path</code> can now be provided as a <code>pathlib.Path</code> object, useful when writing unit tests for plugins. Thanks, Chris Amico. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1365">#1365</a>)

  <p>Summary:      The current model for connected things puts manufacturers inbetween people and their things. That model negatively affects personal freedom, privacy, and society. Alternate models can provide the same benefits of connected devices without the societal and personal costs.</p>



<p>
    In <a href="https://doctorow.medium.com/peloton-bricks-its-treadmills-dc033b74bece">Peloton Bricks Its Treadmills</a>, Cory Doctorow discusses Peloton's response to a product recall on its treadmills. Part of the response was a firmware upgrade. Rather than issuing the firmware upgrade to all treadmills, Peloton "bricked" all the treadmills and then only updated the ones where the owner was paying a monthly subscription for Peloton's service.
</p>

<p>
    When I talk about Internet of Things (IoT), I always make the point that the current architecture for IoT ensures that people are merely renting connected things, not owning them, despite paying hundreds, even thousands, of dollars upfront. Terms and conditions on accounts usually allow the manufacturer to close your account for any reason and without recourse. Since many products cannot function without their associated cloud service, this renders the device inoperable.
</p>

<p>
    I wrote about this problem in 2014, describing the current architecture as the CompuServe of Things. I wrote:
</p>

<blockquote>If Fitbit decides to revoke my account, I will probably survive. But what if, in some future world, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority">root certificate authority</a> of the identity documents I use for banking, shopping, travel, and a host of other things decides to revoke my identity for some reason? Or if my car stops running because Ford shuts off my account? People must have autonomy and be in control of the connected things in their life. There will be systems and services provided by others and they will, of necessity, be administered. But those administering authorities need not have control of people and their lives. We know how to solve this problem. Interoperability takes "intervening" out of "administrative authority." 
</blockquote>

<p>
    The architecture of the CompuServe of Things looks like this:
</p>


	<a></a>
	CompuServe of Things Architecture (click to enlarge)


<p>
    We're all familiar with it. Alice buys a new device, downloads the app for the device to her phone, sets up an account, and begins using the new thing. The app uses the account and the manufacturer-provided API to access data from the device and control it. Everything is inside the administrative control of the device manufacturer (indicated by the gray box).
</p>

<p>
    There is an alternative model:
</p>


	<a></a>
	Internet of Things Architecture (click to enlarge)


<p>
    In this model, the device and data about it are controlled by Alice, not the manufacturer. The device and an associated agent (pico) Alice uses to interact with it have a relationship with the manufacturer, but the manufacturer is no longer in control. Alice is in control of her device, the data is generates, and the agent that processes the data. Note that this doesn't mean Alice has to code or even manage all that. She can run her agent in an agency and the code in her agent is likely from the manufacturer. But it could be other code instead of or in addition to what she gets from the manufacturer. The point is that Alice can decide. A true <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/12/the_self-sovereign_internet_of_things.shtml">Internet of Things is self-sovereign</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Can this model work? Yes! We proved the model works for a production connected car platform called Fuse in 2013-2014. Fuse had hundreds of customers and over 1000 devices in the field. I <a href="https://www.windley.com/tags/fuse.shtml">wrote many articles about the experience, it's architecture, and advantages</a> on my blog.
</p>

<p>
    Fuse was built with picos. Picos are the actor-model programming system that we've developed over the last 12 years to build IoT products that respect individual autonomy and privacy while still providing all the benefits we've come to expect from our connected devices. I'll write more about picos as a programming model for reactive systems soon. Here's some related reading on my blog:

<p>
    Our current model for connected devices is in conflict, not only with our ability to functions as autonomous individuals, but also our vision for a well-functioning society. We can do better and we must. Alternate architectures can give us all the benefits of connected devices without the specter of Big Tech intermediating every aspect of our lives.

  <p>A small enhancement to Datasette this week: I've added support for proxying via Unix domain sockets.</p>
<p>This started out as a feature request from Aslak Raanes: <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1388">#1388: Serve using UNIX domain socket</a>.</p>
<p>I've not worked with these much before so it was a good opportunity to learn something new. Unix domain sockets provide a mechanism whereby different processes on a machine can communicate with each over over a mechanism similar to TCP, but via a file path instead.</p>
<p>I've encountered these before with the Docker daemon, which listens on path <code>/var/run/docker.sock</code> and can be communicated with using <code>curl</code> like so:</p>
 <code>curl --unix-socket /var/run/docker.sock \
  http://localhost/v1.41/containers/json
</code> 
<p>Plenty more examples <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/sdk/examples/">in the Docker documentation</a> if you click the 'HTTP' tab.</p>
<p>It turns out both nginx and Apache have the ability to proxy traffic to a Unix domain socket rather than to an HTTP port, which makes this a useful mechanism for running backend servers without attaching them to TCP ports.</p>
 Implementing this in Datasette 
<p>Datasette uses the excellent <a href="https://www.uvicorn.org/">Uvicorn</a> Python web server to serve traffic out of the box, and Uvicorn already <a href="https://www.uvicorn.org/settings/#socket-binding">includes support for UDS</a> - so adding support to Datasette was pretty easy - here's <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/commit/180c7a5328457aefdf847ada366e296fef4744f1">the full implementation</a>. I've added a new <code>--uds</code> option, so now you can run Datasette like this:</p>
 <code>datasette --uds /tmp/datasette.sock fixtures.db
</code> 
<p>Datasette will "listen" on <code>/tmp/datasette.sock</code> - which means you can run requests via <code>curl</code> like so:</p>
 <code>curl --unix-socket /tmp/datasette.sock \
  http://localhost/fixtures.json | jq
</code> 
<p>More importantly, it means you can configure nginx or Apache to proxy to the Datasette server like this (nginx):</p>
  daemon off;
events {
  worker_connections  1024;
}
http {
  server {
    listen 80;
    location / {
      proxy_pass http://datasette;
      proxy_set_header Host $host;
    }
  }
  upstream datasette {
    server unix:/tmp/datasette.sock;
  }
}  
<p>Or like this (Apache):</p>
 <code>ProxyPass / unix:/tmp/datasette.sock|http://localhost/
</code> 
 Writing tests 
<p>The implementation was only a few lines of code (to pass the <code>uds</code> option to Uvicorn) but adding a test proved a little more challenging. I used this pytest fixture to spin up a server process:</p>
 @pytest.fixture(scope="session")
def ds_unix_domain_socket_server(tmp_path_factory):
    socket_folder = tmp_path_factory.mktemp("uds")
    uds = str(socket_folder / "datasette.sock")
    ds_proc = subprocess.Popen(
        ["datasette", "--memory", "--uds", uds],
        stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
        stderr=subprocess.STDOUT,
        cwd=tempfile.gettempdir(),
    )
    # Give the server time to start
    time.sleep(1.5)
    # Check it started successfully
    assert not ds_proc.poll(), ds_proc.stdout.read().decode("utf-8")
    yield ds_proc, uds
    # Shut it down at the end of the pytest session
    ds_proc.terminate() 
<p>I use a similar pattern <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/blob/7f4c854db1ed8c15338e9cf42d2a3f0c92e3b7b2/tests/conftest.py#L104-L155">for some other tests</a>, to exercise the <code>--ssl-keyfile</code> and <code>--ssl-certfile</code> options added in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1221">#1221</a>.</p>
<p>The test itself looks like this, taking advantage of HTTPX's ability to make calls against Unix domain sockets:</p>
 @pytest.mark.serial
@pytest.mark.skipif(not hasattr(socket, "AF_UNIX"), reason="Requires socket.AF_UNIX support")
def test_serve_unix_domain_socket(ds_unix_domain_socket_server):
    _, uds = ds_unix_domain_socket_server
    transport = httpx.HTTPTransport(uds=uds)
    client = httpx.Client(transport=transport)
    response = client.get("http://localhost/_memory.json")
    assert {
        "database": "_memory",
        "path": "/_memory",
        "tables": [],
    }.items() &lt;= response.json().items() 
<p>The <code>skipif</code> decorator avoids running this test on platforms which don't support Unix domain sockets (which I think includes Windows, see <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1388#issuecomment-877716359">this comment</a>).</p>
<p>The <code>@pytest.mark.serial</code> decorator applies a "mark" that can be used to selectively run the test. I do this because Datasette's tests run in CI using <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pytest-xdist/">pytest-xdist</a>, but that's not compatible with this way of spinning up a temporary server. Datasette actually runs the tests in GitHub Actions <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/blob/7f4c854db1ed8c15338e9cf42d2a3f0c92e3b7b2/.github/workflows/test.yml#L27-L30">like so</a>:</p>
  - name: Run tests
  run: |
    pytest -n auto -m "not serial"
    pytest -m "serial"  
<p>The <code>pytest -n auto -m "not serial"</code> line runs almost all of the tests using <code>pytest-xdist</code> across an automatically selected number of processes, but skips the ones marked with <code>@pytest.mark.serial</code>. Then the second line runs the remaining serial tests without any additional concurrency.</p>
<p>Documenation and example configuration for this feature can be found in the <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/deploying.html#running-datasette-behind-a-proxy">Running Datasette behind a proxy</a> documentation. Thanks to Aslak for contributing the notes on Apache configuration.</p>

<p>In The Chess Master and the Computer, Garry Kasparov famously wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>The winner was revealed to be not a grandmaster with a state-of-the-art PC but a pair of amateur American chess players using three computers at the same time. Their skill at manipulating and “coaching” their computers to look very deeply into positions effectively counteracted the superior chess understanding of their grandmaster opponents and the greater computational power of other participants. Weak human + machine + better process was superior to a strong computer alone and, more remarkably, superior to a strong human + machine + inferior process.</p></blockquote>
<p>The title of his subsequent TED talk sums it up nicely: Don’t fear intelligent machines. Work with them.</p>
<p>That advice resonates powerfully as I begin a second work week augmented by GitHub Copilot, a coding assistant based on OpenAI’s Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT-3). Here is Copilot’s tagline: “Your AI pair programmer: get suggestions for whole lines or entire functions right inside your editor.” If you’re not a programmer, a good analogy is Gmail’s offer of suggestions to finish sentences you’ve begun to type.</p>
<p>In mainstream news the dominant stories are about copyright (“Copilot doesn’t respect software licenses”), security (“Copilot leaks passwords”), and quality (“Copilot suggests wrong solutions”). Tech Twitter amplifies these and adds early hot takes about dramatic Copilot successes and flops. As I follow these stories, I’m thinking of another. GPT-3 is an intelligent machine. How can we apply Kasparov’s advice to work effectively with it?</p>
<p>Were I still a tech journalist I’d be among the first wave of hot takes. Now I spend most days in Visual Studio Code, the environment in which Copilot runs, working most recently on analytics software. I don’t need to produce hot takes, I can just leave Copilot running and reflect on notable outcomes.</p>
<p>Here was the first notable outcome. In the middle of writing some code I needed to call a library function that prints a date. In this case the language context was Python, but might as easily have been JavaScript or SQL or shell. Could I memorize the date-formatting functions for all these contexts? Actually, yes, I believe that’s doable and might even be beneficial. But that’s a topic for another day. Let’s stipulate that we can remember a lot more than we think we can. We’ll still need to look up many things, and doing a lookup is a context-switching operation that often disrupts flow.</p>
<p>In this example I would have needed a broad search to recall the name of the date-formatting function that’s available in Python: strftime. Then I’d have needed to search more narrowly to find the recipe for printing a date object in a format like Mon Jan 01. A good place for that search to land is <a href="https://strftime.org/">https://strftime.org/</a>, where Will McCutchen has helpfully summarized several dozen directives that govern the strftime function.</p>
<p>Here’s the statement I needed to write:</p>
<p>day = day.strftime('%a %d %b')</p>
<p>Here’s where the needed directives appear in the documentation:</p>
<p></p>
<p>To prime Copilot I began with a comment:</p>
<p># format day as Mon Jun 15</p>
<p>Copilot suggested the exact strftime incantation I needed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is exactly the kind of example-driven assistance that I was hoping <a href="https://twitter.com/GitHubCopilot?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@githubcopilot</a> would provide. Life's too short to remember, or even look up, strptime and strftime.</p>
<p>(It turns out that June 15 was a Tuesday, that doesn't matter, Mon Jun 15 was just an example.) <a href="https://t.co/a1epnaZRF9">pic.twitter.com/a1epnaZRF9</a></p>
<p>— Jon Udell (@judell) <a href="https://twitter.com/judell/status/1412111420561367059?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 5, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Now it’s not hard to find a page like Will’s, and once you get there it’s not hard to pick out the needed directives. But when you’re in the flow of writing a function, avoiding that context switch doesn’t only save time. There is an even more profound benefit: it conserves attention and preserves flow.</p>
<p>The screencast embedded in the above tweet gives you a feel for the dynamic interaction. When I get as far as # format day as M, Copilot suggests MMDDYYY even before I write Mon, then adjusts as I do that. This tight feedback loop helps me explore the kinds of natural examples I can use to prime the system for the lookup.</p>
<p>For this particular pattern I’m not yet getting the same magical result in JavaScript, SQL, or shell contexts, but I expect that’ll change as Copilot watches me and others try the same example and arrive at the analogous solutions in these other languages.</p>
<p>I’m reminded of <a href="http://jonudell.net/udell/gems/delicious/delicious.html">Language evolution with del.icio.us</a>, from 2005, in which I explored the dynamics of the web’s original social bookmarking system. To associate a bookmarked resource with a shared concept you’d assign it a tag broadly used for that concept. Of course the tags we use for a given concept often vary. Your choice of cinema or movie or film was a way to influence the set of resources associated with your tag, and thus encourage others to use the same tag in the same way.</p>
<p>That kind of linguistic evolution hasn’t yet happened at large scale. I hope Copilot will become an environment in which it can. Intentional use of examples is one way to follow Kasparov’s advice for working well with intelligent systems.</p>
<p>Here’s a contrived Copilot session that suggests what I mean. The result I am looking for is the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].<br>
<code><br>
l1 = [1, 2, 3]<br>
l2 = [3, 4, 5]<br>
# merge the two lists<br>
l3 = l1 + l2 # no: [1, 2, 3, 3, 5]<br>
# combine as [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]<br>
l3 = l1 + l2 # no: [1, 2, 3, 3, 5]<br>
# deduplicate the two lists<br>
l1 = list(set(l1)) # no: [1, 2, 3]<br>
# uniquely combine the lists<br>
l3 = list(set(l1) | set(l2))  # yes: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]<br>
# merge and deduplicate the lists<br>
l3 = list(set(l1 + l2)) # yes: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]<br>
</code></p>
<p>The last two Copilot suggestions are correct; the final (and simplest) one would be my choice. If I contribute that choice to a public GitHub repository am I voting to reinforce an outcome that’s already popular? If I instead use the second comment (combine as [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) am I instead voting for a show-by-example approach (like Mon Jun 15) that isn’t yet as popular in this case but might become so? It’s hard for me — and likely even for Copilot itself — to know exactly how Copilot works. That’s going to be part of the challenge of working well with intelligent machines. Still, I hope for (and mostly expect) a fruitful partnership in which our descriptions of intent will influence the mechanical synthesis even as it influences our descriptions.</p>

 Core issue with crypto / stable-coins <p>The biggest unsolved issue with crypto&nbsp;is</p>  its abuse as facilitator of ransomeware / extortion — causing continuous tightening of regulations.  Pseudo-anonymous money laundering that causes traceable risks to Banks (unlike cash which is completely anonymous) — causing <a href="https://www.state.gov/de-risking/">“de-risking”</a> and therefore resulting in extreme and continuous friction for crypto to go mainstream.  <p>Due to the irreversible nature of crypto-currencies together with pseudo-anonymous traceability of dirty money, banks face unlimited risk in serving as on-ramps or off-ramps to&nbsp;crypto.</p> US-banking grade KYC at a global level is not possible with current technology   Identity document can be tampered or stolen — any document can be photoshopped. There is no global database of “photos/biometric” and therefore it is possible to create fake/stolen identities easily.  Impersonation checks don’t exist — There is a 15% error rate in verifying peoples faces with hi-resolution photos in passports by trained immigration professionals in a physical setting. Matching a digital photo with scanned ID by untrained staff or even AI is just no possible.  Address checks don’t exist — There is no global method to verify current address of a given person. Any utility bill can be photoshopped or&nbsp;stolen.  <p>Current Gold standard for digital on-boarding is bank verification by linking your account or verifying test-deposits of few cents in your bank but it only works domestically.</p>  The issue is that this kind of linking of accounts is not possible internationally over a swift&nbsp;network.  The alternative solutions like Plaid do not give global coverage and only work in core few developed countries.  <p>In current scenario— Banks in most countries like switzerland, singapore, UK etc require physical visits or otherwise extremely cumbersome Notary / appostille of documents to even open non-crypto accounts.</p> DIRO is a fundamental new technology <p>that eliminates these bottlenecks not just for crypto-currencies but horizontally for many traditional industries.</p>  Makes Global impersonation check possible — it is the first breakthrough technology that not only turns each and every institutional / government/ corporate website into an identity authenticator. This new technology extends the Gold standard (like Plaid) for US-banking grade identity verification at a global&nbsp;scale.  Makes Global address check possible — can verify any current utility bill from any country, any language, any company be it Telephone, Gas, Electricity, TV, Internet, Municipal taxes or&nbsp;even  100% global coverage — without the need for any third party cooperation/ APIs or agreements.  100% guaranteed — DIRO leverages the time tested and battle tested SSL/TLS technology and blockchain to generate mathematically provable and court-admissible evidence. The documents produced using DIRO are even stronger than physical originals.  <p>Privacy and data protection — The documents produced by DIRO are not only reportable and audit-able by third-parties and regulators but also provide decentralised verification on blockchain (without the typical “phone-home privacy problem”). The access to global private data behind login and passwords are accessed by the USER under is GDPR right to access his own data while automatically providing consent for verification to&nbsp;proceed.</p>

    What is NEW in this article about decision making? <p>The new part explains the relationship between choices, decisions and judgement and how our questions indicate if our relationship is curious and constructive OR linear, framed, and destructive.&nbsp; This article is part of a <a href="https://www.digital20.com/masterclass">masterclass</a> I have been creating on how we, as directors and those in leadership, can improve our choices, decisions and judgements using data and be better ancestors.&nbsp;</p><p>This article is not another self-help or “use this framework to improve decision making”; it is for the curious and those who ask questions on their journey. The refelction at the end should be "How does this article affect our views on the automation of decision making and the use of AI?"</p> Why is this an important topic? <p>Our individual and unique view of the world comprises layers of constructs created by our personality, biases, preferences, facts, and ideas learnt from past experiences.&nbsp; These constructs are better known as “mental models”, which frame how we individually make sense of or align to the world. We continually develop sense-making frameworks, models, and maps in our brains that frame what we perceive as reality, thus affecting our behaviour and, consequently, our Choices, decisions, and Judgments (CDJ).</p><p>Whilst we don’t like it, our mental model frames how we see the world.&nbsp; I love how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassie_Kozyrkov">Cassie Kozyrkov</a> (chief decision-maker at Google) describes in this <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/statistics-are-you-bayesian-or-frequentist-4943f953f21b">article</a> using the toss of a coin to determine how you see the world.&nbsp; Statistics predict one aspect of chance but not how you perceive the results when the coin has landed, and the outcome is known but not to you. My dad taught me to toss the coins a few more times until I got the result I wanted. It was a reinforcement model that I had made the right decision from the possible two choices.&nbsp; I would also suggest following and reading <a href="https://lisafeldmanbarrett.com/">Lisa Feldman Barrett</a> work, especially her new book “<a href="https://lisafeldmanbarrett.com/books/seven-and-a-half-lessons-about-the-brain/">seven and a half lessons about the brain</a>.” She says that we must grasp that everything we perceive as reality is, in fact, constructed from fragments, and we have no idea what reality really is.&nbsp; (yes, this is reinforcement bias - I am quoting things to frame you that align to my model)</p><p>In our digital era, new uncertainty, <a href="https://opengovernance.net/quantum-risk-a-wicked-problem-that-emerges-at-the-boundaries-of-our-data-dependency-2dc36dfb21fb">quantum risk</a>, and more ambiguity constantly challenge our <a href="https://opengovernance.net/what-occurs-when-physical-beings-transition-to-information-beings-146ea9dcbca3">mental models</a> and how we accommodate and make sense.&nbsp; The volume of <a href="https://opengovernance.net/the-shadowy-hierarch-5780154de92">noise and signals</a> coming into our brains is high, but we filter and convert it all into something that has meaning to each of us according to our own unique mental model.&nbsp; We all reach different interpretations about what is happening, which creates frustration, confusion and misalignment. We use questions to clarify and check our understanding, assumptions and quality of information. Slight differences always remain; the unsaid, mislead, guided, incentivised, and overconfidence, unfortunately, takes us from the simple to correct misalignments; to tension, conflict and entrenchment.</p><p>This topic matters as directors are mandated to make decisions, but we find we are operating with misalignments, tensions, compromises, and outright conflict.&nbsp; This happens as the <a href="https://opengovernance.net/power-agency-and-influence-a-new-framework-about-complex-relationships-73f5e97295ef">individuals sitting at the same table have agency</a> (and their own mental models and incentives). We are unsure if we have the right choices or are clear about our judgment’s unintended consequences or long-term impact. We have to talk about it.&nbsp;</p><p>We should unpack our relationship with choice, decision and judgement as mental models, hierarchy and rules constrain us. This article is not about “how to ask better questions”, nor if you should (as some questions we don’t want the answer to), but how to determine if you, your team or your company has a constructive or destructive relationship with CDJ.&nbsp;</p><p>---</p><p>When talking about CDJ, you would imagine that in 2021 that starting from the definitions should help, but it does not, as there is a recursive loop of using one definition to define the other words, which define themselves.&nbsp; Amazingly there are professional bodies for <a href="https://www.decisionprofessionals.com/">decision making</a> and <a href="http://www.sjdm.org/">judgement</a>; alas, even these cannot agree on how to define or clearly demark between intent and actions. Our base problem is that:&nbsp; everything framed with a maths or data mind: is a decision. Everything is a choice when framed by a psychologist or social scientist. To someone who has authority and responsibility or plays with complexity, everything looks like a judgment.&nbsp; Confusingly everything is an opinion to a judge!</p><br><p>Everything framed with a maths or data mind: is a decision. Everything is a choice when framed by a psychologist or social scientist. To someone who has authority and responsibility or plays with complexity, everything looks like a judgment.&nbsp; Confusingly everything is an opinion to a judge!</p><br><p>Here are the definitions from the Collins and Oxford dictionaries&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Choice &nbsp;[countable noun] If there is a choice of things, there are several of them, and you can choose the one you want.&nbsp; [countable noun] Your choice is someone or something that you choose from a range of things. <a href="https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/choice">Collins </a>&nbsp;OR &nbsp;[countable] an act of choosing between two or more possibilities; something that you can choose&nbsp; [uncountable] the right to choose; the possibility of choosing <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/choice_1?q=choice">Oxford Dictionary</a></p><p>Decisions&nbsp; [countable noun] When you make a decision, you choose what should be done or which is the best of various possible actions.&nbsp; [uncountable noun] Decision is the act of deciding something or the need to decide something <a href="https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/decision">Collins </a>&nbsp;OR &nbsp;[countable] a choice or judgement that you make after thinking and talking about what is the best thing to do&nbsp; [uncountable] the process of deciding something <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/decision?q=decision">Oxford Dictionary</a></p><p>Judgment [uncountable noun] is the ability to make sensible guesses about a situation or sensible decisions about what to do.&nbsp; [variable noun] A judgment is an opinion that you have or express after thinking carefully about something&nbsp; <a href="https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/judgment">Collins </a>&nbsp;OR &nbsp;[uncountable] the ability to make sensible decisions after carefully considering the best thing to do; [countable, uncountable] an opinion that you form about something after thinking about it carefully; the act of making this opinion known to others <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/judgement?q=judgment">Oxford Dictionary</a></p><br><p><br></p><p>Therefore, a judgment is the ability to make a sensible decision about a choice, which requires judgment about which choices to pick. As Yoda would say, “wise decision you make, stupid choices your judgement however selected.”</p> The timeless challenges of Choices, Decisions and Judgment (CDJ) <p>“I change my mind as the data changes” is a modern digital age sentiment from the economist John Maynard Keynes who is quoted to have said, "When the facts change, I change my mind." It was likely adapted from an early human bias where leadership in war and battles refused to change their mind even when the facts were in, and they had been proven wrong.&nbsp;</p><p>Choices, decisions and judgement are not difficult if you relinquish your values, ethics and blindly follow the incentives or can fully appreciate the impact of your actions. Still, we know it is just not that simple. We have heuristics to remove choice rather than create more and ways to find more data and facts to become more informed, but without knowing if the new data is helpful or not.&nbsp; Ultimately, at some point, you have to make a choice, decision or judgement.&nbsp;</p><p>The diagram below represents some of the timeless challenges of CDJ, which is a balance between what we know and don’t know.&nbsp; We have the experience that creates the ghosts of the past, flighting the voices of the present as we try to decide what the spirits of the future hold, whilst being held accountable for the decisions we make.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>The point here is that it is always possible to find a reason why to act or not to act and the timeless challenge remains that there is no perfect choice, decision or judgment.&nbsp; However, over time and because we have choices we can make decisions that improve our judgement which means we can find and select the right choices.&nbsp; This is a constructive relationship between CDJ.&nbsp; A destructive relationship would be to not like the choices we face, procrastinate in the hope a better choice occurs or maybe lose a choice where the decision is made for you. You don’t improve your judgment and so you cannot determine if the next choice is any better - it is linear.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Is the CDJ relationship about framing? <p>From the definition section at the beginning of this article, it was evident that there is a high degree of overlap and dependency between choice, decision and judgment.&nbsp; As highlighted in the previous section it can become complex very quickly but our brain (mental models) demand patterns to make sense of it and so we tend to come back to simple linear narratives which do not do them (choice, decisions, judgment) justice. What we have realised but tend not to verbalise is that none of our (mental) models or frameworks work in all cases and indeed all models about choice, decision and judgment fail.&nbsp; This is why there is always a new book on the topic with new self-help content that you have not seen before, and we cling to a hope that the next model will work better - alas they don’t. I am aware of over 100 decision support models and I expect I have not really scratched the surface. &nbsp; An example below puts choice, decision and judgment on a continuum between your own north star and that for a shared tribe, community or society.&nbsp; It does not really work.&nbsp; White flag time.&nbsp;</p><p>What we have realised but tend not to verbalise is that none of our (mental) models or frameworks work in all cases and indeed all models about choice, decision and judgment fail.</p><br><p></p><p>#Lockdowns have enabled many social experiments.&nbsp; One has been about choice and buying behaviour.&nbsp; As we moved our shopping for food online and therefore missed the in store sale specials, end of gondea, carefully placed items next to each other, those large piled up offers in the entrance and the sweets at the exit, our patterns have changed as choice became limited.&nbsp; We became creatures of habit, buying largely the same items, which reduce in variance over time.&nbsp; (This also highlights that the UI and UX for shopping sucks.)&nbsp; The decision to shop was removed from us, and our choices fell, but the variety was still there.&nbsp; So much for the Web creating perfect information or the algorithm knowing what you would want.&nbsp;</p><p>As an alternative, we can determine that CDJ will change depending on the context right now and the perception those facing the issue have.&nbsp; The figure below highlights three examples but what we rapidly conclude is that complexity in CDJ is generated by speed, volume, consequences, data, sense of enquiry, situation and our own mental models. Every known variable adds layers.</p><p></p><br> Where are we up to and where next? <p>So far, we have explored that there is a relationship between choices, decisions and judgements. We, however, tend to focus on one of them (decision making) as it looks the most difficult, and the others are just linkages. However, this preference for “decision making” fails to understand if we are using the right word to describe the action we are taking. There is no doubt that the word decision is preferable as it is perceived as more powerful and important than choice or judgment. The relationship between them is causal, complex and relational, and we are framed, educated and incentivised to the simple linear view and a single narrative. The reality is that judgement helps frame our choices which we decide on that improve our judgment skills — they are not linear; they are circular. They are circular as we all have agency.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;The reality is that judgement helps frame our choices, which we decide on, that improve our judgment skills</p><p></p><p>We know the linear models are broken as there is no universal tool to help with choice, decision and judgement.&nbsp; The next part is to explain the relationship we have between choices, decisions and judgement and how our questions indicate if it is constructive and curious OR linear, framed and destructive.</p><p>We tend to focus on the decision and choice axis. If we can eliminate bad choices we can improve decisions, but ignore the fact that it is judgment skills that help find the right choice. Procrastination as a decision tool is framed that time will remove choice and so a decision becomes easier, either because a choice has been removed or more data supports one option. More data does not make decision-making easier; nor does it guarantee to make it better.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Worthy of note is that academic work about “decision-making” will always seek to create the most complex solution because academics are incentivised to use the most advanced and new thinking (publication, referencing, research and reputation). Sometimes tossing a coin is the perfect solution. &nbsp; The more we see the complex, the less we will accept the simple.&nbsp; In a linear world where we view choice, decision and judgment as a progression line, where we are given choices when young and make a judgement when we are old and wise ignore that we learn and need to exercise all three all the time to become more proficient at decision making.&nbsp; Decision making is not a task or an end game.&nbsp;</p><p>As a thought experiment: if you had all the <a href="https://opengovernance.net/data-for-better-decisions-nature-or-nurture-79e6531dbe3a">data</a> in the world and all the compute power possible to run a perfect forecast model, would you need to make further choices, decisions or judgments?&nbsp; To reach your view I assume you have decided to either give each human full <a href="https://opengovernance.net/power-agency-and-influence-a-new-framework-about-complex-relationships-73f5e97295ef">agency</a> or you have taken our individual <a href="https://opengovernance.net/power-agency-and-influence-a-new-framework-about-complex-relationships-73f5e97295ef">agency</a> away.&nbsp; Now in my definition of data, which might be different to yours, how we all behave with our agency is just data, which opens up a can of worms for each of us. Can you have full agency (freewill) and it all still be modelled? What do we mean about behavioural modelling, agency, data and even more precisely <a href="https://medium.com/mydata/data-is-data-e2a877cb206b">all data</a>?</p><p>Getting to one data set, one tool, one choice hides layers of complexity which looks good for one better decision but is unlikely to be a long term solution to improving choices, decisions and judgment.&nbsp; You have/had choice, you make/made decisions, you exhibit/exercise judgment.&nbsp; Judgement supports you in finding choices.&nbsp;</p> How the questions we ask inform us!&nbsp; <p>The questions you are currently asking will help inform you where you are in the cycle, indeed if you already have closed the loop and have a constructive cycle or a linear open loop distructure relationship with choice, decisions and judgment.&nbsp;</p><p>The circular framing means depending on the stage we are in a process we will be asking different questions.&nbsp; Given that a board has to deal with many situations all at different stages at every meeting, we should see all these questions asked at every meeting, just framed to different agenda items.&nbsp; If there is no variation in questions,&nbsp; surely it tells us something.&nbsp; Indeed are we using our improvement at each stage to further improve the next outcome.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>The destructive “cycle” is not circular but is a linear model as it is fundamentally disconnected from a learning based idea using choice and judgement and focussed on Better Decision making. It depends on the idea that by reading a new book or going on a new decision making course that we will get better.&nbsp; The iteration of improvement is an external influence.&nbsp; Perhaps it is mentoring or coaching and they (mentors) keep you from closing the loop as they either don’t know or it would not support their business model. Indeed books, education and courses have no interest in you closing the loop and always making you believe in a new tool, method, process - it is their business model!</p><p></p><p>In the boardroom or in the senior management meetings is someone always asking the same questions?&nbsp; Does the agenda mean that as a team individuals are unable to ask different questions or is it that others are influencing the agenda to keep it framed to the decisions and outcomes they want.&nbsp; Why enable the asking for more data when the choice they want you to decide on and agree with is already the best supported case (<a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo/the-railroad-of-no-choice-a55420cea06f">railroaded</a>).&nbsp; Do you have observers or assessors who look at the questions you ask as a team and determine if you are asking the right questions? (something I am learning to do)&nbsp; Can skills in choice, decision and judgment be determined by the questions asked in the meetings? (something I am exploring)</p><p>A key question I often come back to when thinking about choice, decisions and judgment is “What are we optimising for?” I find the model below a helpful guide to understand the framing.&nbsp; In a linear model it would present moving from single choice in the lower left to complex judgment in the top right. In a learning cyclic model, choice, decision and judgement equally applies, however the lower left is a better learning and experience gaining context for mentoring, or succession planning, than the top right.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Why does this matter, because right now we have increasing data along with more vulnerabilities, ambiguity, complexity and uncertainty. The volume of moving variables (change) and the rate of change breaks the linear model as you can never match the model at hand to the situation you face.&nbsp; There is a need to move from linear ideas of choice, decisions and judgment to a circular one.&nbsp; Linear thinking is the best model when there are limited options and there is stability.&nbsp; We now have many options, increasing variables and more instability.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As your <a href="https://opengovernance.net/what-99-of-the-public-and-95-of-venture-and-investment-capital-have-got-wrong-69239b4da4f1">company is owned by no-one</a> (yes you read that right - follow this <a href="https://opengovernance.net/what-99-of-the-public-and-95-of-venture-and-investment-capital-have-got-wrong-69239b4da4f1">link</a> if you need to read more on this, a company owns itself) and a company cannot think for itself and therefore we (the directors) have to do the thinking for it.&nbsp; We are given in law the authority and responsibility to act on behalf of the company.&nbsp; This is “fiduciary duty”.&nbsp; It is the reason why directors need to move from a linear perspective of decision making to a circular improvement learning process of choice, decision making and judgement.</p><p>My proposal to help support better governance is that we request companies publish the questions asked in a board meeting. Not the answers, but definitely the questions.</p><br>

          <p>In those first 100 days, it will become evident if you are about to be railroaded or if you have to present the choice without creating railroading for those data laggards. The latter being the job, the former being a problem.</p>      <p>To be clear, railroaded means in this context:</p>  to force&nbsp;something&nbsp;to be officially approved or accepted without much discussion or thought.  to force&nbsp;someone&nbsp;into doing something quickly, usually without enough information.  <p>As the CDO, are you about to find that the tracks have already been laid and that you on the train and it is going in one direction. You are now the figurehead of the new shinny data plan based on already accepted wisdom. Your hope, before starting the role, is that it is more analogous to a personal transport situation. This would be where you get to pick the fuel (food, combustible), vehicle (walk, run, bike, motorcycle, car, van, lorry, aeroplane, boat), the destination and the route. Using the analogy of the train on the tracks, the decision to create a data-led organisation, the ontology, the data we have and the value we will create has been made irrespective of what you come up with, or what the data might be able to tell you. The processes are in place, and your role is not to craft, invest, create or imagine but to follow the tracks of command and control. It is at that moment that you realise just how good the CEO is at sales.</p><p>In this case, your priorities are: How to find the right tools that align or match what you are faced with? And, how do you take a senior leadership team and fellow directors on a journey to discover that they can change the rails, change the vehicle and be open to changing how we see the journey from A to B? Indeed based on a pandemic, do we need to physically move at all?</p><p>When the “railroaded” is you and you are being asked to approve something when you have not had the time or opportunity to gather the data or understand the processes, what are the right words to create time to explore and not appear indecisive, trying to procrastinate or evasive?</p><blockquote><p>what are the right words to create time to explore so as not to appear indecisive, trying to procrastinate or evasive?</p></blockquote><p>Presenting an argument about why you need more time is likely to fail, as the defensive response will always be “we have already done the work but it is your decision — trust us” Asking questions that check that the choices and opinions are the right ones or to determine the consequences will equally draw you into an argument where “the facts are the facts,” you have to decide or do you not trust us?</p><p>One question that will give some breathing space is “For what are we optimising,” as explored below.</p>          <p>The two-axis on the model set the horizontal scale of the short and long term against the vertical axis how many variables, from one to many. In asking the question “for what are we optimising,” you are not presenting this framework, but use the question to understand what the “railroading” is trying to achieve; through understanding what the decision being expected is optimising for. With this knowledge, you may find it is easier to take the railroaded decision. If you can conclude they are optimising for many externalities and long term, you are immersed in a team that can cope and manage complexity- this is going to be fun. If this is short term and a single variable you know that incentives are the significant driver and slowly changing the incentives will create a better place for making more complex data decisions. One scenario is outside of this framing which is that they actually don’t know what they are optimising for and the decision at hand is just another reaction to previous poor railroaded decisions. Definitely a red flag moment.</p> Note to the CEO <p>Using railroading as an activity to discover an individuals capability and backbone is always likely to go wrong. In this data-driven complex world where both the data and the analysis is a long way from your immediate access, you may also feel you are being railroaded by the signals and noise. It is likely you will ask “is this recommendation optimising for xyz (the plan you have agreed to) and how can you show this is the optimal path&nbsp;without&nbsp;using the same data” Love the misattributed quote that Ronald Reagan stole from the Russians but so can we.&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust,_but_verify">Trust, but verify.</a></p>

  <p>Earlier this week I released Django SQL Dashboard 1.0. I also just released 1.0.1, with a bug fix for PostgreSQL 10 contributed by Ryan Cheley.</p>
<p><a href="https://django-sql-dashboard.datasette.io/">Django SQL Dashboard</a> is my tool for adding a read-only, bookmarkable SQL querying interface to any Django plus PostgreSQL project. I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/May/10/django-sql-dashboard/">introduced it with a demo video</a> back in May.</p>
 Django SQL Dashboard column menu 
<p>The big new feature <a>in 1.0</a> (aside from the confident version number) is a new contextual menu against each column from the results. This is best demonstrated by an animated demo:</p>
<p></p>
<p>The new cog action menu is <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/2/datasette-column-actions/">inspired by Datasette</a> (and reuses the same icon). It works a little differently though: since Django SQL Dashboard only ever deals with SQL queries (unlike Datasette which often shows results directly from a filtered table) the options in the cog menu work by rewriting the original SQL.</p>
<p>This turns out to be pretty easy, because PostgreSQL (and every other modern SQL implementation) supports nested queries. So if your original SQL query is:</p>
  select * from entries
where category = 'python'  
<p>You can sort by a column like this:</p>
  select * from (
  select * from entries
  where category = 'python'
) as results
order by "title"  
<p>And you can count unique values like this:</p>
  select "title", count(*) as n from (
  select * from entries
  where category = 'python'
) as results
group by "title" order by n desc  
<p>My initial implementation of this feature did <a href="https://github.com/simonw/django-sql-dashboard/issues/135">have one flaw</a>: if you sorted by a column, then sorted by another column, it would nest the queries multiple times - so you could end up with something like this:</p>
  select * from (
  select * from (
    select * from blog_blogmark
  ) as results order by "link_title"
) as results order by "link_url" desc  
<p>I'm confident the query optimizer reduces this to the minimum amount of work, but it doesn't look very pretty. I realized that since I generate most of the SQL I could catch this using a pretty dumb regular expression:</p>
 _sort_re = re.compile(
    '(^.*) order by "[^"]+"( desc)?$', re.DOTALL
) 
<p>If that regular expression matches, I can extract the first group and append a new <code>order by</code> to it. If it doesn't match I can fall back to wrapping the entire query.</p>
 Testing against multiple PostgreSQL versions 
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/simonw/django-sql-dashboard/releases/tag/1.0.1">1.0.1 release</a> fixed a bug that only showed up in PostgreSQL 10, spotted (and fixed) by Ryan Cheley.</p>
<p>Django SQL Dashboard runs its tests against a temporary PostgreSQL server, which is spun up using the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/testing.postgresql/">testing.postgresql</a> library.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments/blob/main/images/linux/Ubuntu2004-README.md">default GitHub Actions runner</a> ships with a PostgreSQL 13 server binary just waiting for you to run it. But how can I also run the tests against previous versions?</p>
<p>I ended up following <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/ubuntu/">these instructions</a> provided by PostgreSQL on installing different versions on Ubuntu. I combined these into <a href="https://github.com/simonw/django-sql-dashboard/blob/1.0.1/.github/workflows/test.yml">a GitHub Actions matrix build</a>, so now every commit to Django SQL Dashboard is tested sixteen times(!), against every combination of Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 and PostgreSQL 10, 11, 12 and 13. I wrote up the pattern I used in <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/github-actions/different-postgresql-versions">this TIL</a>.</p>

<p>Today I finished up a tool that you can use to export your complete history from Foursquare and publish the checkins to your website!</p>

<p>In 2017, I created <a href="https://ownyourswarm.p3k.io">OwnYourSwarm</a> to export my future Swarm checkins to my website in real-time. It's been working great, and it's meant that I have had a complete archive of all my checkins on my website ever since then, so I don't have to worry if Foursquare disappears one day. However, I never got around to creating a way to export my past checkins, so I was always missing my checkin history from 2009-2016.</p>

<p>I had been considering building this as a feature of OwnYourSwarm, but realized that it would end up taking a lot of additional effort to make it work well as a web service, in addition to dealing with possible rate limit issues with the Foursquare API. So instead, this is published as a downloadable script you can run on your own computer. This also means you have a bit more flexibility in how you can use it, as well as being able to customize it more if you choose.</p>

<p>You can download the code from GitHub here:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/aaronpk/Swarm-Checkins-Import">https://github.com/aaronpk/Swarm-Checkins-Import</a></p>

<p>The readme has installation and usage instructions, so I'll refrain from repeating all that in this post. Make sure to check out the step by step tutorial in the readme if you want to use this with your own account.</p>

<p>The process is broken up into a couple steps.</p>

 
 First, it downloads your entire Foursquare checkin history to JSON files on your computer 
 Second, it downloads all the photos from your checkins 
 Third, it publishes each checkin to your website via <a href="https://micropub.net">Micropub</a> 
 

<p>If your website doesn't support checkins via Micropub, or if you don't want your checkins on your website at all, you can just skip that step entirely, and instead you'll have a complete export of your data locally.</p>

<p>The JSON files contain the raw API response from Foursquare, so you can do what you want with that as well, such as turning it into your own HTML archive using your own custom tools if you want.</p>

<p>The one issue that I don't have a good solution for is handling renamed venues. Unfortunately the API returns the current name for old checkins, so if a venue is renamed, your old checkins will not reflect the name at the time of the checkin. This is particularly strange for businesses that have gone through an acquisition or rebranding, since for example all my old checkins in Green Dragon are now labeled as Rogue Eastside Brewery. As far as I can tell there isn't a good way to handle this, so I may have to go back and manually edit the posts on my website for the venues I know have been renamed.</p>

<p>I hope this is useful to people! I will be sleeping a little easier now knowing that my old checkin history is safely archived on my website now!</p>

<p>At MATTR we’re always dreaming up ways to make decentralized identity and verifiable credentials easy and intuitive to use for as many people as possible.</p><p>From the start, it’s been a core part of our mission to make sure that end users understand the implications of decentralized identity and the control it affords them over their data and their privacy. This model offers users greater sovereignty over their own information by empowering individuals as both the holder and subject of information that pertains to them. Users are able to exercise their new role in this ecosystem by utilizing a new class of software known as <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/concepts/digital-wallets">digital&nbsp;wallets</a>.</p><p>We first released our <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/onboarding/install/wallet">Mobile Wallet</a> for smartphones in June 2020, with a simple user interface to allow people to interact with and receive credentials from issuers as well as present credentials to relying parties. In the interim, we have developed a number of improvements and features to the Mobile Wallet to support advanced capabilities such&nbsp;as:</p>  Authenticating to Identity Providers over OpenID Connect to receive credentials via OIDC&nbsp;Bridge  Deriving privacy-preserving selective disclosure presentations from credentials using BBS+ signatures  Establishing a secure DID messaging inbox for users to receive encrypted messages and push notifications  <p>These changes have not only made the wallet more functional; they’ve also evolved to better protect users’ best interests — giving them privacy-by-design and surfacing the information and context that they need to confidently make decisions underpinned by the security of decentralized identity.</p>Timeline of MATTR wallet development<p>This journey has led us to realize the importance of creating a wallet experience that places users front and center. As these systems create more opportunity for user-driven consent and identity management, they’ve simultaneously created a demand for a wallet that can not only perform the technical operations required, but do so in a user-friendly way that surfaces the information that truly matters to people. Our latest feature release to the MATTR Mobile Wallet is a step in this direction.</p><p>With Human-Friendly Credentials, we have added the capability to render different kinds of credentials uniquely in the wallet interface according to the information they contain. Until now, the end user experience for verifiable credentials has been largely consistent across different categories of credentials and issuers. In other words, a credential containing medical data from your doctor looks exactly the same as an education credential from your university or a concert ticket from a music venue: they all appear to the user as a long list of&nbsp;claims.</p><p>In this release we change that. Thanks to the semantic information encoded in verifiable credentials, the wallet is now able to understand and interpret certain kinds of credentials to render them to the user in a way that makes the data easier to understand.</p><p><a href="https://learn.mattr.global/concepts/semantic-web#json-ld">JSON-LD</a> verifiable credentials have the ability to support common data vocabularies and schemas which are published on the web. For example, if a credential contains a claim describing the name of an individual, the claim can be defined via reference to an existing data vocabulary found here: <a href="https://schema.org/Person">https://schema.org/Person</a></p><p>Human-Friendly Credentials allow the wallet to start intelligently displaying known credential types and data types. This shows up in a variety of different ways in a user’s&nbsp;dataset.</p><p>For example, this update formats address fields to make them more readable; formats names and proper nouns where possible; makes URLs, telephone numbers and email addresses clickable; highlights images and icons for better trust and brand signaling; and creates basic rules for language localization that adjust to a user’s device settings. This logic allows the wallet to create a kind of information hierarchy that starts to draw out the important aspects of data included in a credential, so users can make trust-based decisions using this information.</p><p>These rules are applied to any kind of credential the wallet encounters. Whilst all of this is incredibly helpful for users, we have gone a step further: displaying entire credentials in a completely unique UI according to their type. The ‘type’ property of a credential expresses what kind of information is in the credential — is it a degree, a medical record, a utility bill? The usage of common credential types across different implementations and ecosystems is necessary for semantic interoperability on the broader scale. The wallet should be able to recognize these common credential types and display them to the user in a friendly&nbsp;way.</p><p>In this update, we have added custom rendering for both Personal Identity Credentials as well as Education Courses. These are common types we see occurring naturally across the decentralized identity landscape, and now the MATTR Mobile Wallet is able to recognize and display them properly.</p>Personal Identity Credentials and Education Course credentials<p>An important note to consider is that Human-Friendly Credentials only work for known data and credential types. As the ecosystem matures, we expect to add more data types and credential types in the future to support an even broader set of human-related processes and actions. In a general sense, we will also continue to iterate on our digital wallet offerings to provide a greater degree of flexibility and control for end users. We believe it’s a vital component to a healthy digital trust ecosystem.</p><p>To check out these changes yourself, download the latest version of our <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/onboarding/install/wallet">Mobile Wallet</a> to get&nbsp;started.</p><p>For more information on Human-Friendly Credentials, check out our tutorials and video content on MATTR&nbsp;Learn.</p><p>For everything else related to MATTR, visit <a href="https://mattr.global">https://mattr.global</a> or follow <a href="https://twitter.com/mattrglobal">@MattrGlobal on&nbsp;Twitter</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/rendering-credentials-in-a-human-friendly-way-e47f4a32fd4b">Rendering credentials in a human-friendly way</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>I recently came out as nonbinary trans-femme.
That's a picture of me on the left, with my spouse Morgan Lemmer-Webber
on the right.</p>
<p>In a sense, not much has changed, and so much has changed.
I've dropped the "-topher" from my name, and given the common tendency
to apply gender to pronouns in English, please either use nonbinary
pronouns or feminine pronouns to apply to me.
Other changes are happening as I wander through this space, from
appearance to other things.
(Probably the biggest change is finally achieving something resembling
self-acceptance, however.)</p>
<p>If you want to know more,
<a href="https://fossandcrafts.org/episodes/30-gender-sexuality-personal-perspective.html">Morgan and I did a podcast episode</a>
which explains more from my present standing, and also explains Morgan's
experiences with being demisexual, which not many people know about!
(Morgan has been incredible through this whole process, by the way.)</p>
<p>But things may change further.
Maybe a year from now those changes may be even more drastic, or maybe
not.
We'll see.
I am wandering, and I don't know where I will land, but it won't be
back to where I was.</p>
<p>At any rate, I've spent much of my life not being able to stand myself
for how I look and feel.
For most of my life, I have not been able to look at myself in a mirror
for more than a second or two due to the revulsion I felt at the person
I saw staring back at me.
The last few weeks have been a shift change for me in that regard...
it's a very new experience to feel so happy with myself.</p>
<p>I'm only at the beginning of this journey.
I'd appreciate your support... people have been incredibly kind to me
by and large so far but like everyone who goes through a process like this,
it's very hard in those experiences where people aren't.
Thank you to everyone who has been there for me so far.</p>

  <p>Summary:      Ever since the Covid pandemic started in 2020, various groups have seen verifiable credentials as a means for providing a secure, privacy-respecting system for health and travel data sharing. This post explores the ecosystem of ecosystems that is emerging as hundreds of organizations around the world rise to the challenge of implementing a globally interoperable system that also respects individual choice and privacy.</p>




<p>
    In The <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/04/the_politics_of_vaccination_passports.shtml">Politics of Vaccination Passports</a>, I wrote about the controversy surrounding proposals to require people to show proof of vaccination to travel–specifically fly. The worry is that once we get used to presenting a heath credential to travel, for example, it could quickly spread. Presenting an ID of some kind could become the default–with bars, restaurants, churches, stores, and every other public place saying "papers, please!" before allowing entry.
</p>

<p>
    My personal take is that while I'd rather avoid that scenario, it is likely inevitable. And if that's true, I'd love to have it designed in a way that respects individual choice and personal privacy as much as possible. This is a tall order because getting the tech right is only the first step on a long road. The air travel industry is global, gargantuan, and incredibly decentralized. Building an interoperable system of travel passes requires not just an ecosystem, but an ecosystem of ecosystems.
</p>

<p>
    Suppose Alice lives in <a href="https://designated-survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Naruba">Naruba</a> and has been vaccinated against Covid. The local hospital where she was vaccinated has issued a credential to Alice with the data about her doses, the dates, vaccine batch numbers, and so on. Alice is traveling on business to the <a href="https://designated-survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Kunami">Emirate of Kunami</a> which requires proof of vaccination. To fly, Alice must present a health pass to the gate agent who works for Kunami Air in the Soji airport. How does Kunami Air know they can trust a credential issued by a hospital they've never heard located in another country?
</p>

<p>
    Building a global, interoperable health and travel pass network requires both technology and governance. This sort of situation isn't new. In fact, if we replaced "proof of vaccination" with "airline ticket" in the preceding scenario, we wouldn't think anything of it. Different companies from different countries have been figuring out how to interoperate and trust the results for decades, maybe centuries.
</p>

<p>
    But doing that digitally, and quickly, is a big job with lots of moving parts. Below I take a look at a few of those parts and how they come together to solve the problem.
</p>

<a></a>
 Good Health Pass Collaborative 

<p>
    The <a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org/">Good Health Pass Collaborative (GHPC)</a> is an "open, inclusive, cross-sector initiative" of dozens of companies from the travel, health, and technology industries that is defining the blueprint for health and travel passes that are privacy-protecting, user-controlled, equitable, globally interoperable, and universally-accepted by international travel.
</p>

<p>
    GHPC is very specific about what a "pass" is:
</p>

<blockquote>
    A credential to which data minimization and anti-correlation have been applied and any relevant travel data has been added so it includes only what a verifier needs to make a trust decision in a specific context (such as boarding a plane).
</blockquote>

<p>
    A credential could have lots of health and travel data. The pass contains just the data needed for a specific context.
</p>

<p>
    <a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org/resources/">GHPC published a set of ten principles</a> in February to guide their work. These principles lay out a path that is consistent with self-sovereignty, respects individual autonomy, and promotes good privacy practices.
</p>

<p>
    In June, GHPC published a blueprint that provides recommendations for building a good health pass. The challenge of meeting the principles, while exchanging health data across different industry sectors can be overwhelming. The blueprint provides specific guidance on how to meet this challenge without sacrificing the principles that make a health pass "good." The recommendations include designs for trust registries and frameworks, data and protocol standards, and other components for the global interoperability of COVID certificate ecosystems.
</p>

<p>
    These efforts say what a good health pass is and give guidance for creating a credential ecosystem, but they don't create any such ecosystems. That's a job for other organizations.
</p>

<a></a>
 The Global COVID Certificate Network 

<p>
    The GHCP Blueprint provides recommendations about trust registries and frameworks, data and protocol standards, and other requirements to create global, interoperability ecosystems for COVID certificates. The <a href="https://www.lfph.io/2021/06/08/gccn/">Linux Foundation's Global COVID Certificate Network (GCCN)</a> "operationalizes and adapts the GHCP Blueprint recommendations for governments and industry alliances who are working to reopen borders." You can think of GCCN as an instantiation of the GHPC Blueprint.
</p>

<p>
    Going back to our traveler, Alice, we can imagine that Naruba and Kunami both have national health systems that can follow the blueprint from GHCP. When Alice uses her health pass inside Naruba, it is reasonable to expect that Narubian businesses will know what a real Narubian health pass looks like and whether to trust it or not. To make this possible, the Narubian health ministry would determine what data a legitimate pass contains (e.g. its schema) and what forms it takes such as the paper design and digital format. The ministry could also determine who in Naruba can issue these health passes and even set up a registry so others in Naruba can find out as well.
</p>

<p>
    This kind of one-size-fits-all, single-source solution can solve the local problem, but when Alice is interacting with people and organizations outside Naruba, the problem is much harder:
</p>

 
     Naruba and Kunami may have adopted different technologies and schema for the credential representing the health pass. 
     Random organizations (and even people) in Kunami need to be able to establish the fidelity of the credential. Specifically, they want to know that it was issued to the person presenting it, hasn't been tampered with, and hasn't been revoked. 
     In addition, these same entities need to be able to establish the provenance of the credential, specifically that it was issued by a legitimate organization who is authorized to attest to the holder's vaccination status. 
 

<p>
    This is where GCCN comes in. GCCN has three components:
</p>

 
     a trust registry network 
     a certificate implementation toolkit 
     a set of recommended vendors 
 

<p>
    The trust registry network and its associated protocol not only helps Naruba and Kunami each establish their own registries of authorized health pass credential issuers, but also enables a directory of registries, so an organization in Kunami can reliably find the registry in Naruba and discover if the issuer of Alice's credential is in it.
</p>

<p>
    The toolkit provides several important components for a working ecosystem:
</p>

 
     a template for a governance framework that governments and industry alliances can use to make their own policies. 
     schema definitions and minimum data sets for the credentials. 
     technical specifications for the software components needed to issue, hold, and verify credentials. 
     implementation guides and open source reference implementations. 
     guidance for creating the governance framework and technical implementation. 
 

<p>
    The vendor network provides a commercial ecosystem to which governments and industry associations can turn for support. The vendor network provides a set of organizations who have competence in building credential ecosystems. Over 25 separate companies and organizations support GCCN.
</p>

<p>
    With all this, GCCN doesn't actually build the ecosystems. That falls to organizations who use GCCN to instantiate the framework provided by GHPC.
</p>

<a></a>
 Building the Ecosystem 

<p>
    One of those organizations is <a href="https://cardea.app/">Cardea</a>. Cardea is a fully open-source and field-tested verifiable digital credential that meets the major requirements of the Good Health Pass Blueprint. Cardea was developed by <a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio</a> and is now a community-led project at <a href="https://www.lfph.io/">Linux Foundation Public Health (LFPH)</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Cardea was trialed on the island of Aruba by <a href="https://www.sita.aero/">SITA</a>, one of the participating companies in the Cardea initiative. SITA is a good partner for this since they're responsible for a majority of airline industry IT systems. In the pilot, travelers could prove their Covid test status at restaurants and other tourist locations around the island. The combination of a good trust framework, and self-sovereign-identity-based credential technology allowed businesses to trust tourists' health information while preserving their privacy.
</p>

<p>
    Another example of a working health pass credential ecosystem is the <a href="https://www.evernym.com/travelpass/">IATA Travel Pass</a>. Travel Pass has been developed by the <a href="https://www.iata.org/en/programs/passenger/travel-pass/">International Air Transport Association (IATA)</a> and leverages verifiable credential technology from Evernym. The IATA Travel Pass is conducting initial pilots with over 50 airlines and the <a href="https://www.businesstraveller.com/business-travel/2020/11/24/iag-working-with-iata-on-its-new-travel-pass/">International Airlines Group (IAG)</a>.
</p>

<p>
    A third example is <a href="https://trinsic.id/medcreds/">Medcreds</a> from <a href="https://www.proofmarket.io">ProofMarket</a>. Medcreds uses the <a href="https://trinsic.id/medcreds/">Trinsic API</a> to provide service. MedCreds partnered with the Georgia Academy of General Dentistry to provide free COVID-19 test credentials to their providers and patients. MedCreds allows dentists to reduce the risk of spreading and contracting COVID-19 by knowing with greater certainty the status of a patient's most recent test. 
</p>

<p>
    Cardea, IATA Travel Pass, and Medcreds have tools for hospitals, labs, and other organizations who issue passes and for the airlines and other venues who verify them. All also have wallet apps for credential holders to use in receiving credentials as well as presenting the proofs that constitute the actual travel pass from those credentials. In addition, all three initiatives include governance frameworks that service their respective ecosystem.
</p>

<p>
    Because all three are compliant with the GHPC's Blueprint and GCCN's architecture and guidance, the ecosystems they each create are part of the global ecosystem of ecosystems for health and travel passes. As more organizations, countries, and technical teams join in this, the global ecosystem of ecosystems will constitute the largest ever verifiable credential use case to date. The planning, design, and implementation show the level of effort necessary to create large credential ecosystems and provide a path for others to follow.
</p>

<p>
    As I said in <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/04/the_politics_of_vaccination_passports.shtml">The Politics of Vaccination Passports</a>, I'm persuaded that organizations like the Good Health Pass Collaborative and Global Covid Credential Network aren't the bad guys. They're just folks who see the inevitability of health and travel passes and are determined to see that it's done right, in ways that respect individual choice and personal privacy as much as possible.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>The article shows how an ASP.NET Core application could implement a sign in and a sign out with two different Azure App registrations which could also be implemented using separate identity providers (tenants). The user of the application can decide to authenticate against either one of the Azure AD clients. The clients can also be deployed on separate Azure Active directories.  Separate authentication schemes are used for both of the clients. Each client requires a scheme for the Open ID Connect sign in and the cookie session. The Azure AD client authentication is implemented using <a href="https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-identity-web">Microsoft.Identity.Web</a>.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCore6Experiments">https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCore6Experiments</a></p>



<p>The clients are setup to use a non default Open ID Connect scheme and also a non default cookie scheme. After a successful authentication, the OnTokenValidated event is used to sign into the default cookie scheme using the claims principal returned from the Azure AD client. “t1” is used for the Open ID Connect scheme and “cookiet1” is used for the second scheme. No default schemes are defined. The second Azure App Registration client configuration is setup in the same way. </p>


  services.AddAuthentication()
   .AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApp(
	Configuration.GetSection("AzureAdT1"), "t1", "cookiet1");

services.Configure&lt;OpenIdConnectOptions&gt;("t1", options =&gt;
{
	var existingOnTokenValidatedHandler 
		= options.Events.OnTokenValidated;
		
	options.Events.OnTokenValidated = async context =&gt;
	{
		await existingOnTokenValidatedHandler(context);

		await context.HttpContext.SignInAsync(
			CookieAuthenticationDefaults
				.AuthenticationScheme, context.Principal);

	};
});

services.AddAuthentication()
	.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApp(
		Configuration.GetSection("AzureAdT2"), "t2", "cookiet2");

services.Configure&lt;OpenIdConnectOptions&gt;("t2", options =&gt;
{
	var existingOnTokenValidatedHandler = options.Events.OnTokenValidated;
	options.Events.OnTokenValidated = async context =&gt;
	{
		await existingOnTokenValidatedHandler(context);

		await context.HttpContext.SignInAsync(
		   CookieAuthenticationDefaults
				.AuthenticationScheme, context.Principal);
	};
});
  


<p>The AddAuthorization is used in a standard way and no default policy is defined. We would like the user to have the possibility to choose against what tenant and client to authenticate.</p>


  services.AddAuthorization();

services.AddRazorPages()
	.AddMvcOptions(options =&gt; { })
	.AddMicrosoftIdentityUI();
  


<p>A third default scheme is added to keep the session after a successful authentication using the client schemes which authenticated. The identity is signed into this scheme after a successfully Azure AD authentication. The SignInAsync method is used for this in the OnTokenValidated event.</p>


   services.AddAuthentication(CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
    .AddCookie();
  


<p>The Configure method is setup in a standard way.</p>


  public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
{
	app.UseHttpsRedirection();
	app.UseStaticFiles();

	app.UseRouting();

	app.UseAuthentication();
	app.UseAuthorization();

	app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =&gt;
	{
		endpoints.MapRazorPages();
		endpoints.MapControllers();
	});
}
  


<p>The sign in and  the sign out needs custom implementations. The SignInT1 method is used to authenticate using the first client and the SignInT2 is used for the second. This can be called from the Razor page view. The CustomSignOut is used to sign out the correct schemes and redirect to the Azure AD endsession endpoint. The CustomSignOut method uses the clientId of the Azure AD configuration to sign out the correct session. This value can be read using the aud claim.</p>

            }
        }
    }
}
  


<p>The _LoginPartial.cshtml Razor view can use the CustomAccount controller method to sign in or sign out. The available clients can be selected in a drop down control. </p>


  &lt;ul class="navbar-nav"&gt;
@if (User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)

        &lt;/li&gt;
}
else
{
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;div class="main-menu"&gt;
                &lt;div class="dropdown"&gt;
                    &lt;button class="btn btn-primary dropdown-toggle" type="button" id="dropdownLangButton" data-toggle="dropdown" aria-haspopup="true" aria-expanded="false"&gt;
                        sign-in
                    &lt;/button&gt;
                    &lt;div class="dropdown-menu" aria-labelledby="dropdownLangButton"&gt;
                        &lt;a class="dropdown-item" asp-controller="CustomAccount" asp-action="SignInT1" &gt;t1&lt;/a&gt;

                        &lt;a class="dropdown-item"  asp-controller="CustomAccount" asp-action="SignInT2"&gt;t2&lt;/a&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
}
&lt;/ul&gt;

  


<p>The app.settings have the Azure AD settings for each client as required.</p>


  {
  "AzureAdT1": {
    "Instance": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/",
    "Domain": "damienbodhotmail.onmicrosoft.com",
    "TenantId": "7ff95b15-dc21-4ba6-bc92-824856578fc1",
    "ClientId": "46d2f651-813a-4b5c-8a43-63abcb4f692c",
    "CallbackPath": "/signin-oidc/t1",
    "SignedOutCallbackPath ": "/SignoutCallbackOidc"
    // "ClientSecret": "add secret to the user secrets"
  },
  "AzureAdT2": {
    "Instance": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/",
    "Domain": "damienbodhotmail.onmicrosoft.com",
    "TenantId": "7ff95b15-dc21-4ba6-bc92-824856578fc1",
    "ClientId": "8e2b45c2-cad0-43c3-8af2-b32b73de30e4",
    "CallbackPath": "/signin-oidc/t2",
    "SignedOutCallbackPath ": "/SignoutCallbackOidc"
    // "ClientSecret": "add secret to the user secrets"
  },
  


<p>When the application is started, the user can login using any client as required. </p>







<p>This works really good, if you don’t know which tenant is your default scheme. If you always use a default scheme with one tenant default, then you can use the  <a href="https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-identity-web/wiki/multiple-authentication-schemes">multiple-authentication-schemes</a> example like defined in the Microsoft.Identity.Web docs.</p>

<p>The best new phones come with the ability to shoot 108 megapixel photos, record 4K video with stereo sound, and pack the results into a terabyte of onboard storage. But what do you do when that storage fills up?</p>
<p>If you want to keep those files, you’ll need to offload them somewhere. Since your computer probably doesn’t have more than 2Tb of storage, you’ll need an external drive. Or two. Or three. Or more. Over time, a lot more.</p>
<p>Welcome to my world.</p>
<p>Gathered here for a portrait in a corner of my desk in Manhattan are 22 hard drives, plus three SD cards that each exceed the capacities of the drives they’re laying on. And then there’s the 2Tb one in the laptop I’m using now. That one has 357.33Gb available. Most of the others you see are also full, dead, or both. Five have FireWire connections, which my current laptop doesn’t comprehend at all. I also have a similar collection of drives in Santa Barbara.</p>
<p>Photos occupy most of the data I’ve stored on all those drives. Currently my photo archives are spread between two portable drives and my laptop, and total about 7Tb. I also have a 5Tb portable drive for videos, which is back in Santa Barbara awaiting dubs off tapes. The portable photo drives are among those in the picture above. Earlier today, my laptop gave me this news about the main one, called Black 4Tb WD Photo Drive:</p>
<p></p>
<p>That’s why I’m transferring its contents over to the 10Tb drive called Elements, on the far left. A progress report:</p>
<p>About 5Tb of Elements is occupied by Apple Time Machine backups. After the transfer is done, there won’t be room for more backups. So my project now is figuring out what to do next.</p>
<p>I could get some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage">Network Attached Storage</a> (NAS). I already have used 2012-vintage 18Tb QNAP one in Santa Barbara that I’ve never been able to make work.</p>
<p>So I am tempted now to put it all in a cloud.</p>
<p>I hadn’t bothered with that before, because upstream speeds have been highly sphinctered by ISPs for decades. Here in New York, where our ISP is Spectrum, our speeds have long run 100-400 Mbps down, but only 10 Mbps up. However…. I just checked again with <a href="https://www.speedtest.net/">Speedtest.net</a>, and got <a href="https://www.speedtest.net/result/11628959761">this</a>:</p>
<p></p>
<p>And that’s over wi-fi.</p>
<p>Now I’m encouraged. But before I commit to a supplier, I’d like to hear what others recommend. Currently I’m considering <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/">Backblaze</a>, which is top rated <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/online-backup-services-reviewed-2624712">here</a>. The cost i $6/month, or less for unlimited sums of data. But I’m open to whatever.</p>
<p>[Later…] Hmm. At that last link it says this:</p>
<blockquote><p>What We Don’t Like:</p>
<p>Something I should mention is that some users have had bad experiences with Backblaze because of a not-so-apparent&nbsp;feature that maybe&nbsp;should&nbsp;be a lot more obvious: Backblaze doesn’t function as a permanent&nbsp;archive of all of your data, but instead as a mirror.</p>
<p>In other words, if you delete files on your computer, or the drive fails and you’re connected to Backblaze’s website, Backblaze will see that those files are gone and will remove them from your online account, too.</p>
<p>Granted, signing up for the forever version history option would eliminate any issues with this, but it still poses a problem for anyone using one of the limited version history options.</p></blockquote>
<p>Alas, <a href="https://help.backblaze.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035247494-Version-History-FAQ">the forever thing is complicated</a>.</p>
<p>To be clear, I want more than a mirroring of what I have on my laptop and external drives. I want to replace those external drives with cloud storage. Is that possible? Not clear.</p>
<p>Alas, for all of us, <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2020/05/15/fossil/">this problem remains</a>.</p>
<p>Oh, and Spectrum now only measures under 10Mbps upstream. So forget the cloud.</p>

<p>Listen Up</p>
<p>By Doc Searls<br>
April 16, 1999&nbsp;</p>
<p>“All I know is that first you’ve got to get mad. You’ve got to say, I’m a human being, goddammit! My life has value! So I want you to get up now. I want all of you to get up out of your chairs. I want you to get up right now and go to the window, open it, and stick your head out, and yell, ‘I’m as mad as hell, and I’m not going to take this anymore!'”<br>
— Howard Beale, in&nbsp;Network, by Paddy Chayevsky</p>
 
<p>Bob Davis is the CEO of Lycos, Inc., whose growing portfolio of companies (excuse me,&nbsp;portals) now includes&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lycos.html/">Lycos</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hotbot.html/">Hotbot</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.whowhere.lycos.com/">WhoWhere</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tripod.html/">Tripod</a>. I’m sure Bob is a great guy. And I’m sure Lycos is a great company. A lot of people seem to like them both. And you have to admire both his ambition and his success. To witness both, read his&nbsp;<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/pcweek/stories/news/0,4153,383571,00.html">interview with PC Week</a>, where he predicts that the Lycos Network (the sum of all its portals) will overtake Yahoo as “#1 on the Web.”</p>
<p>Lycos will win, Davis says, because “We have a collection of quality properties that are segmented into best-of-breed categories, and our reach has been catapulting.”</p>
<p>I can speak for Hotbot, which is still my first-choice search engine; but by a shrinking margin. I often test search engines by looking for strings of text buried deep in long documents on my own site. Hotbot always won in the past. But since Lycos bought it, Hotbot has become more of a portal and less of a search tool. Its page is now a baffling mass of ads and links. And its searches find less.</p>
<p>In today’s test,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.infoseek.com/">Infoseek</a>&nbsp;won. Last week,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.excite.com/">Excite</a>&nbsp;won. Both found pages that Hotbot seems to have forgotten.</p>
<p>Why? Bob Davis gives us a good answer.</p>
<p>“We’re a media company,” he says. “We make our money by delivering an audience that people want to pay for.”</p>
<p>Note the two different species here:&nbsp;audience&nbsp;and&nbsp;people. And look at their qualities. One is “delivered.” The other pays. In other words, one is cargo and the other is money.</p>
<p>Well, I don’t care if Lycos’ stock goes to the moon and splits three times along the way. The only #1 on the Web is the same as the only #1 on the phone: the people who use it. And the time will come when people will look at portals not as sources of “satisfying experiences” (another of Davis’ lines) but as useless intermediaries between supply and demand.</p>



&nbsp;<p></p>
 Words of Walt 
<p>You there, impotent, loose in the knees,<br>
open your scarfed chops till I blow grit within you.<br>
Spread your palms and lift the flaps of your pockets.<br>
I am not to be denied. I compel.<br>
It is time to explain myself. Let us stand up.<br>
I know I am solid and sound.<br>
To me the converging objects of the universe perpetually flow.<br>
</p>
<p>I know that I am august,<br>
I do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself<br>
or be understood.<br>
I see that the elementary laws never apologize.</p>
<p>.<br>
— Walt Whitman, from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.searls.com/bookstore.html#Anchor">Song of Myself</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Media company” guys like Davis are still in a seller’s market for wisdom that was BS even when only the TV guys spoke it —&nbsp;back when it literally&nbsp;required&nbsp;the movie “Network.” That market will dry up. Why? Because we’ve been mad as hell for about hundred years, and&nbsp;now we don’t have to take it anymore.</p>
<p>Three reasons.</p>
 
 Humanity. This is what Walt Whitman reminded us about more than a hundred years ago.&nbsp;We are not impotent. Media companies may call us seats and eyeballs and targets, but&nbsp;that’s their problem. They don’t get who we are or what we can — and will —&nbsp;do. And the funny thing is, they don’t get that what makes us powerful is what they think makes&nbsp;them&nbsp;powerful: the Internet. It gives us choices. Millions of them. We don’t have to settle for “channels” any more. Or “portals” that offer views of the sky through their own little windows. Or “sticky” sites that are the moral equivalent of flypaper. 
 Demand.&nbsp;There never was a demand for messages, and now it shows, big time. Because the Internet is a meteor that is smacking the world of business with more force than the rock that offed the dinosaurs, and it is pushing out a&nbsp;tsunami of demand&nbsp;like nothing supply has ever seen. Businesses that welcome the swell are in for some fun surfing. Businesses that don’t are going to drown in it. 
 Obsolescence. Even the media guys are tired of their own B.S. and are&nbsp;finally in the market for clues. 
 
<p>Alvin Toffler had it right in&nbsp;The Third Wave.&nbsp;Industry (The Second Wave) “violently split apart two aspects of our lives that had always been one… production and consumption… In so doing, it drove a giant invisible wedge into our economy, our psyches … it ripped apart the underlying unity of society, creating a way of life filled with economic tension.” Today all of us play producer roles in our professions and consumer roles in our everyday lives. This chart shows the difference (and tension) between these radically different points of view — both of which all of us hold:</p>




Producer view

 
 Consumer view 
 



Metaphor
Business is shipping (“loading the channel,” “moving products,” “delivering messages”)
Business is shopping (“browsing,” “looking,” “bargaining,” “buying”)


Orientation
Business is about moving goods from one to many (producers to consumers)
Business is about buying and selling, one to one


Markets
Markets are shooting ranges: consumers are “targets”
Markets are markets: places to shop, buy stuff and talk to people


Relationships
Primary relationshiphs are with customers, which are more often distributors &amp; retailers rather than consumers
Primary relationships are with vendors, and with other customers



<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>These are all just clues, which are easily deniable facts. Hence a line once spoken of Apple: “the clue train stopped there four times a day for ten years and they never took delivery.” But Apple was just an obvious offender. All of marketing itself remains clueless so long as it continues to treat customers as “eyeballs,” “targets,” “seats” and “consumers.”</p>
<p>For the past several months, I have been working with Rick Levine, David Weinberger and Chris Locke on a new railroad for clues: a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cluetrain.com/">ClueTrain</a>.</p>
<p>Our goal is&nbsp;to burn down Marketing As Usual. Here is the logic behind the ambition:</p>
 
<p>Markets are conversations<br>
Conversations are fire<br>
Marketing is arson</p>
 
<p>The result is&nbsp;<a href="http://public.wsj.com/careers/resources/documents/19990412-frontlines.htm">here</a>&nbsp;— in what The Wall Street Journal calls “presumptuous, arrogant, and absolutely brilliant.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cluetrain.com/">Take a ride</a>. If you like it,&nbsp;<a href="http://cluetrain.com/signer.cgi">sign up</a>. Feel free to set fires with it, add a few of your own, or flame the ones you don’t agree with. What matters is the conversation. We want everybody talking about this stuff. If they do, MAU is toast.</p>
<p>Here is my own short form of the Manifesto (inspired by Martin Luther, the long version has 95 Theses). Feel free to commit arson with (or to) any of these points as well.</p>
 
 
 Ten facts about highly effective markets: 
 
 Markets are conversations.<br>
None of the other metaphors for markets —&nbsp;bulls, bears, battlefields, arenas, streets or invisible hands — does full justice to the social nature of markets.&nbsp;Real market conversations are social. They happen between human beings. Not between senders and receivers, shooters and targets, advertisers and demographics. 
 The first markets were markets.<br>
They were real places that thrived at the crossroads of cultures. They didn’t need a market model, because they&nbsp;were&nbsp;the model market. More than religion, war or family, markets were&nbsp;real places&nbsp;where communities came together. They weren’t just where sellers did business with buyers. They were the place where everybody got together to hang out, talk, tell stories and learn interesting stuff about each other and the larger world.&nbsp;‘ 
 Markets are more about demand than supply.<br>
The term “market” comes from the latin&nbsp;mercere, which means “to buy.” Even a modern market is called a “shopping center” rather than a “selling center.” Bottom line: every market has more buyers than sellers. And the buyers have the money. 
 Human voices trump robotic ones.<br>
Real voices are honest, open, natural, uncontrived. Every identity that speaks has a voice. We know each other by how we sound. That goes for companies and markets as well as people. When a voice is full of shit, we all know it — whether the voice tells us “your call is important to us” or that a Buick is better than a Mercedes. 
 The real market leaders are people whose minds and hands are worn by the work they do.<br>
And it has been that way ever since our ancestors’ authority was expressed by surnames that labeled their occupations — names like Hunter, Weaver, Fisher and Smith. In modern parlance, the most knowledge and the best expertise is found at the “point of practice:” That’s where most of the work gets done. 
 Markets are made by real people.<br>
Not by surreal abstractions that insult customers by calling them “targets,” “seats,” “audiences,” “demographics” and “eyeballs” — all synonyms for&nbsp;consumers, which Jerry Michalski of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sociate.com/">Sociate</a>&nbsp;calls “brainless gullets who live only to gulp products and expel cash.” 
 Business is not a conveyor belt that runs from production to consumption.<br>
Our goods are more than “content” that we “package” and “move” by “loading” them into a “channel” and “address” for “delivery.” The business that matters most is about shopping, not shipping. And the people who run it are the customers and the people who talk to them. 
 Mass markets have the same intelligence as germ populations.<br>
Their virtues are appetite and reproduction. They grow by contagion. Which is why nobody wants to admit belonging to one. 
 There is no demand for messages.<br>
To get what this means, imagine what would happen if mute buttons on remote controls delivered “we don’t want to hear this” messages directly back to advertisers. 
 Most advertising is unaccountable.<br>
Or worse, it’s useless. An old advertising saying goes, “I know half my advertising is wasted. I just don’t know which half.” But even this is a lie. Nearly all advertising is wasted. Even the most accountable form of advertising — the junk mail we euphemistically call “direct marketing” —&nbsp;counts a 3% response rate as a success. No wonder most of us sort our mail over the trash can. Fairfax Cone, who co-founded Foote Cone &amp; Belding many decades ago, said “Advertising is what you do when you can’t go see somebody. That’s all it is.” With the Net you&nbsp;can&nbsp;go see somebody. More importantly, they can see you. More importantly than that, you can both talk to each other. And make real markets again.

<p>Formalized journalism is outnumbered.</p>
<p>In the industrialized world (and in much of the world that isn’t), nearly everyone of a double-digit age has a Net-connected mobile device for sharing words they write and&nbsp;scenes they shoot.</p>
<p>While this doesn’t obsolesce professional journalists, it marginalizes and re-contextualizes them. Worse, it exposes the blindness within their formalities. Dave Winer lays this out clearly in <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/06/23/162312.html?title=theyCantSeeWhatTheyCantSee">They can’t see what they can’t see</a>. An excerpt:</p>
<blockquote><p>Journalism, academia, government and the corporate world all hire from the same talent pool.</p>
<p>They go to the same universities, get their news from the same sources. Corporate people take government jobs, then go back to the corporations. The people move fluidly in and out of each bucket.</p>
<p>So you get the same story, the reality they believe in, developed over centuries, that is radically different from the reality most other people experience. The story recited daily at CNN, MSNBC, The New Yorker, NYT. The world changes, again and again, and the story they tell is how angry this makes them, and how everyone must snap back.</p>
<p>New technologies can make change possible, like the one we’re using now.</p>
<p>We would never have Trump if it weren’t for Twitter.</p></blockquote>
<p>Marshall McLuhan, dead since 1980, had something to say about that:</p>
<blockquote><p>People don’t want to know the cause of anything. They do not want to know why radio caused Hitler and Gandhi alike. They do not want to know that print caused anything whatever.</p></blockquote>
<p>Also,</p>
<blockquote><p>All media work us over completely. They are so pervasive… that they leave no part of us untouched unaffected, unaltered… Any understanding of social and cultural change is impossible without a knowledge of the way media work as environments.</p></blockquote>
<p>What could be more worked-over than our new <a href="https://dsearls.medium.com/what-does-the-internet-make-of-us-118421ac5e">nature as digital beings</a>? Consider&nbsp;where and what you are reading right now, on your desk, your lap or in your hand. This was barely imaginable when the word “journalism” <a href="https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=journalism&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2019&amp;corpus=26&amp;smoothing=3&amp;direct_url=t1%3B%2Cjournalism%3B%2Cc0">came into use</a> around 1830.</p>
<p>What are we now? While remaining no less embodied than we ever were, we are incorporeal inhabitants of a digital world, absent of distance and gravity, where the only preposition that fully applies is&nbsp;with. Unless we aren’t. Ephemerality runs deep, and the Web is a whiteboard.</p>
<p>I don’t have an answer to the question in my headline. I tried one out three years ago, in my first, last and only TEDx talk, <a href="https://tedxsantabarbara.com/2018/doc-searls/">The story isn’t the whole story</a>. To summarize, we gotta start local.</p>
<p>Because it is essential to be real with each other in the physical world, especially when fully relevant news actually happens. Conspiracy theories and other forms of bullshit will always be everywhere, but it’s harder for them to apply or survive when your building is on fire or your neighborhood is flooding.</p>
<p>Outside of that, I’m starting to think we need a new discipline: one that doesn’t start with the word&nbsp;journal. And decades may pass before we have it.</p>

<p>Today’s <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/new-fido-ux-guidelines-and-specification-enhancements/">FIDO Alliance announcement</a> describes the enhancements in the second version as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Enhancements to FIDO standards to accelerate passwordless in the enterprise</p>
<p>The FIDO Alliance has announced enhancements to its FIDO2 specifications, which include several new features that will be helpful for passwordless enterprise deployments and other complex security applications. Both FIDO2 specifications were recently updated by their governing bodies – with the World Wide Web Consortium  (W3C) approving WebAuthn Level 2 and FIDO doing the same for CTAP 2.1.</p>
<p>Key to these enhancements is enterprise attestation, which provides enterprise IT with improved management of FIDO authenticators used by employees. Enterprise attestation enables better binding of an authenticator to an account, assists with usage tracking and other management functions including credential and pin management, and biometric enrollment required in the enterprise.</p>

<p>2020年に、物理的な世界からサイバー世界への移行がかつてないスピードで進みました。COVID-19がその移行を課したのです。5年から10年分の変化が数ヶ月の間に行われたと言う人もいます。そこでは、ステイホーム・ポリシーにより物理的な世界でのコミュニケーション能力が大きく制限され、サイバー・コミュニケーションに大きく依存するようになりました。サイバー空間では、あらゆるコミュニケーションはDigital Being（サイバースペースにおける私たちのデジタル表現）を通じて行われます。しかし、Digital Beingが無形である以上、私たちの「安全な生活」に欠かせない、当たり前だと思っている物理的な存在の多くの特性がそこにはありません。このセッションでは、私たちのデジタルライフを安全で安心なものにするために必要な、Digital Beingの7つの原則を概観します。</p>The post <a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2021/06/4801/">Identiverse: 7 Principles of Digital Being</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.sakimura.org">@_Nat Zone</a>.

<p>…and got a notice that said,</p>
<p></p>
<p>That was to my building in Manhattan: a three-story walk-up in a district that’s post-dangerous but pre-gentrified. In other words, safe; but not beyond worry that someone could walk off with a box on the steps that says Amazon on it.</p>
<p>We live on the top floor, so it took me a minute to get from my desk to the front door, where there was nothing. So I went to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/contact-us/">Amazon’s Contact Us page</a> and got this:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then, after I clicked on the big yellow button, a dialog ensued :</p>
 
 
<blockquote>
 Hi! It’s Amazon’s messaging assistant again.

 Could you confirm what went wrong, so I can help?

 Sorry to hear that. Tell me a little more about what happened.

<p>Messaging Assistant | Customer Service</p>
 
 OK, looks like the delivery status may have been updated too soon. 
 
 
 
 
 The good news is it should arrive soon. Give us until end of day Wednesday, Jun 23. 
 
 
 
 
 Really appreciate your patience with this. Is there anything else I can help with?

 No, that’s all

 Thanks for choosing Amazon. I’m here to help whenever you have an issue. 
 
<p>12:50 PM</p>
 
 Messaging Assistant has left. Thanks for contacting Amazon! 
</blockquote>
<p>This kind of thing has happened before; not just with Amazon, and not just here. In fact, it has happened enough times for me to wonder whether there is a method to the madness.</p>
<p>I mean, is “the delivery status may have been updated too soon” an occurrence that’s common for a reason? Also, might that reason be technical, human, neither or both?</p>
<p>To be fair, this is not a big deal. Progress is how the miraculous becomes mundane, and this is a good example of it the mundane miraculous at work. “No sooner said than shipped” is the new norm. So are conversations with robots.</p>
<p>I’d love it if one could give me answers below, but that feature isn’t working right now. So feel free to tweet yours or something. Thanks!</p>

 Example Design of an Authorization System with Verifiable Credentials and the Tradeoffs 

 Problem summary 

<p>In this blog post, I’ll cover an example design that relies upon verifiable credentials where a CFO is delegating access to their assistant to authorize purchases made by the company. The primary focus of this blog post is to highlight the different problems that are likely to occur when going down the path of building an authorization system with verifiable credentials. I’ll be sure to keep things at a higher level so that anyone can understand these tradeoffs, but take you through the details that would be thought through by an architect designing the system. Enjoy, and feel free to leave comments or reach out to me for questions, suggested improvements, or other aspects I didn’t fully consider.</p>

 Use case description 

<p>In this use case, the issuer is an employer who wishes to provide an employee credential to their CFO. Now their CFO as a part of their job has a lot of capabilities afforded to them as a senior executive. Let’s say this CFO has two abilities. They can sign off on quarterly reports and they can authorize purchases. Now let’s say the employer issues them the following credential:</p>

   <code>{
 "@context": [
   "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
   {
    "@vocab": "https://example.com/employer/"
   }
  ],
  "id": "http://example.com/employer/credentials/123",
  "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "EmployerCredential"],
  "issuer": "https://example.com/employer",
  "issuanceDate": "2010-01-01T19:73:24Z",
  "credentialSubject": {
    "id": "did:example:cfo",
    "jobTitle": "Chief Financial Officer",
    "employeeNumber": 123,
  },
  "revocation": {
    "id": "http://example.gov/revocations/738",
    "type": "SimpleRevocationList2017"
  },
  "proof": {
      "type": "Ed25519Signature2020",
      "created": "2019-12-11T03:50:55Z",
      "proofValue": "....",
      "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",
      "verificationMethod": "https://example.com/employer/key1"
    }
}
</code>   

<p>All is good and well, now the CFO can do their job. Now let’s say the CFO has been bombarded with purchase authorization requests recently while trying to prepare the quarterly report and has asked their assistant to assist with the backlog of purchase requests as long as the requests are under $10,000. To do this, the CFO decides to delegate their employee credential to their assistant because the payment authorization system relies upon the jobTitle attribute to determine the capabilities.</p>

<p>So, the CFO delegates the following credential to their assistant and hands over their employee credential too:</p>

   <code>{
 "@context": [
   "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
   {
    "@vocab": "https://example.com/employer/"
   }
  ],
  "id": "http://example.com/employer/credentials/123",
  "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "EmployerCredential"],
  "issuer": "did:example:cfo",
  "issuanceDate": "2010-01-01T19:73:24Z",
  "credentialSubject": {
    "id": "did:example:assistant",
    "jobTitle": "Chief Financial Officer",
    "employeeNumber": 123,
  },
  "revocation": {
    "id": "http://example.gov/revocations/738",
    "type": "SimpleRevocationList2017"
  },
  "proof": {
      "type": "Ed25519Signature2020",
      "created": "2019-12-11T03:50:55Z",
      "proofValue": "....",
      "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",
      "verificationMethod": "did:example:cfo#key1"
    }
}
</code>   

<blockquote>
  <p>Side rhetorical consideration around the semantics of this VC as a standalone VC, why is the CFO declaring that their assistant has the jobTitle “Chief Financial Officer” now? This is what I mean when I say using verifiable credentials for authorization systems introduces bad semantics. To skirt around authorization systems we’re bending the semantics of the claims in the credentials in ways that don’t make sense. And that’s ignoring the second and third-order effects that are inherently going to be introduced!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Great, so now the assistant can generate the following delegated verifiable Presentation to authorize payments:</p>

   <code>{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
   {
    "@vocab": "https://example.com/employer/"

                "@vocab": "https://example.com/employer/"
            }

        "credentialSubject": {
            "id": "did:example:cfo",
            "jobTitle": "Chief Financial Officer",
            "employeeNumber": 123,
        },

    {

        "credentialSubject": {

            "jobTitle": "Chief Financial Officer",

        "proofPurpose": "authentication",
        "verificationMethod": "did:example:assistant#key1"
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Sweet, now the assistant can authorize payments! Let’s review what the steps are for the payment authorization system now with this.</p>

<p>VP Request checks</p>

 
   Check that the verificationMethod is associated with the authentication proofPurpose for the assistant. 
   Check that the verificationMethod for the VP proof is associated with the delegation credential <code>credentialSubject.id</code> 
   Check that the proofValue is valid in the VP proof (the bottom one) based on the associated verificationMethod for the assistant 
   Check that the challenge matches the VP Request 
 

<p>Delegation Credential checks</p>

 
   Check that the verificationMethod is associated with the assertionMethod proofPurpose for the CFO in the delegation credential 
   Check that the verificationMethod in the delegation credential is associated with the issuer property of the delegation credential 
   Check that the proofValue is valid in the delegation credential proof (the middle one) based on the associated verificationMethod for the CFO 
   Check that the <code>credentialSubject.jobTitle</code> has “Chief Financial Officer” in the delegation credential 
   Check that the issuer property in the delegation credential matches the <code>credentialSubject.id</code> in the original credential 
 

<p>Original Credential checks</p>

 
   Check that the verificationMethod is associated with the assertionMethod proofPurpose for the employer in the original credential 
   Check that the verificationMethod in the original credential is associated with the issuer property of the original credential 
   Check that the proofValue is valid in the original credential proof (the top one) based on the associated verificationMethod for the CFO 
   Check that the <code>credentialSubject.jobTitle</code> has “Chief Financial Officer” in the original credential 
   Check that the original credential isn’t revoked 
 

<blockquote>
  <p>Note to consider: If the credentials in the verifiable presentation are ordered incorrectly that’s going to introduce some problems</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But wait how did the authorization system know that the assistant has been attenuated with limited permission to only authorize payments below $10,000? Well, we’ve got a few different ways we could do that, let’s take a look at the ways we can extend this simple delegation pattern.</p>

 Extension 1: CFO adds a <code>maximumAuthorizationLimit</code> property to the delegation credential 

<p>So in this scenario, the CFO adds <code>maximumAuthorizationLimit</code> property like so:</p>

   <code>{
    "@context": [
        "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
        {
            "@vocab": "https://example.com/employer/"
        }
    ],
    "id": "http://example.com/employer/credentials/123",
    "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "EmployerCredential"],
    "issuer": "did:example:cfo",
    "issuanceDate": "2010-01-01T19:73:24Z",
    "credentialSubject": {
        "id": "did:example:assistant",
        "jobTitle": "Chief Financial Officer",
        "employeeNumber": 123,
        "maximumAuthorizationLimit": 10000
    },
    "proof": {
        "type": "Ed25519Signature2020",
        "created": "2019-12-11T03:50:55Z",
        "proofValue": "....",
        "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",
        "verificationMethod": "did:example:cfo#key1"
    }
}
</code>   

<p>and the verifiable presentation would now look like this:</p>

   <code>{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
   {
    "@vocab": "https://example.com/employer/"
   }
  ],
  "id": "did:example:76e12ec21ebhyu1f712ebc6f1z2",
  "type": ["VerifiablePresentation"],
  "verifiableCredential": [
    {
        "@context": [
            "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
            {
                "@vocab": "https://example.com/employer/"
            }
        ],

<p>Awesome, so now we have a verifiable presentation that attenuates the delegated capabilities of making authorization payments and limits the payments to $10000 for the assistant. This new property introduces some new checks though in our business logic.</p>

 
   Check that the <code>credentialSubject.maximumAuthorizationLimit</code> in the delegation credential is below the limit afforded to the <code>credentialSubject.jobTitle</code> 
   Check that the payment hasn’t exceeded the <code>credentialSubject.maximumAuthorizationLimit</code> 
 

<p>But wait, when we delegated the ability for the assistant to authorize payments we also inadvertently allowed the assistant to sign off on the quarterly reports! Oh no! Now, we’ve got a legal liability issue on our hands.
We’ll need to build on top of option 1 to make sure that the assistant isn’t signing off on our quarterly reports too and so that we can adhere to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege">principle of least authority</a>. We’ll cover that in option 2.</p>

 Extension 2: limiting the assistant’s abilities to only payment authorization capabilities 

<p>Since the CFO has two capabilities, we need to disable the one that would allow the assistant to also sign off on quarterly reports. We’re going to go ahead and do this via the introduction of the <code>canSignQuartlyReports</code> claim.</p>

<p>So now the delegation credential looks like this:</p>

   <code>{
    "@context": [
        "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
        {
            "@vocab": "https://example.com/employer/"
        }
    ],

    "credentialSubject": {
        "id": "did:example:assistant",
        "jobTitle": "Chief Financial Officer",
        "employeeNumber": 123,

</code>   

<p>Finally, we’ve got a properly attenuated delegation verifiable credential to address our use case! So what’s the issue with this? First off, we’re using only a toy example here where the CFO has only two capabilities.
Most businesses aren’t paying CFOs the big bucks to only handle those two things though (If they are let me know, I’m sure I can figure that job out 😊). This means that for every additional capability that we don’t want to be delegated we have to add a permission property. By doing this we’re effectively building a deny list with only one capability removed to enable a single capability. Why not build off of and allow list model instead? (Hint this is the approach ZCAP-LDs take)</p>

<p>So our delegation credential could end up looking something like this:</p>

   <code>{
    "@context": [
        "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
        {
            "@vocab": "https://example.com/employer/"
        }
    ],
    "id": "http://example.com/employer/credentials/123",
    "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "EmployerCredential"],
    "issuer": "did:example:cfo",
    "issuanceDate": "2010-01-01T19:73:24Z",
    "credentialSubject": {
        "id": "did:example:assistant",
        "jobTitle": "Chief Financial Officer",
        "employeeNumber": 123,
        "maximumAuthorizationLimit": 10000,
        "canSignQuartlyReports": false,
        "canDoXCapability": false,
        "canDoYCapability": false,
        "canDoZCapability": false,
        ...
    },
    "proof": {
        "type": "Ed25519Signature2020",
        "created": "2019-12-11T03:50:55Z",
        "proofValue": "....",
        "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",
        "verificationMethod": "did:example:cfo#key1"
    }
}
</code>   

 Tradeoffs with this design 

<p>Furthermore, the semantics of the claims in this new credential is quite odd. We’ve effectively combined a claims token and a permission token into a single verifiable Credential here. By doing this we’re far more likely to be issuing and reissuing the same credential many times as access to the delegatee needs to be updated. This also has second-order effects on the maintainability and adaptability that are best described by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter">principle of least knowledge</a>.</p>

<p>It also just so happens, these types of deny lists are awesome things to get your hands on as well when you’re performing the reconnaissance phase of a penetration test to break into a system. Now our system design is helping the attackers assuming they get ahold of one of the credentials, but none of the keys. If they get the keys, problems that are better left out of scope for this writeup occur.</p>

<p>Additionally, the fact that we need to perform 16 checks just to achieve our goal means that it’s highly likely that one gets missed and an authorization bypass vulnerability is introduced. As is pointed out in the CCG mailing list though, this is mainly a byproduct of the fact we’re performing delegation rather than the usage of VCs themselves. However, delegation is only complicated when done correctly. After all, when people are sharing their Netflix passwords they too are delegating and that is a simple implementation for the verifier. So the takeaway here is that the more we can reduce the number of checks when building transparent delegation the more resilient and secure the authorization system is likely to be.</p>

 Conclusion 

<p>In conclusion, I stand by the opinion that utilizing verifiable credentials to build authorization systems is possible, but more work than is necessary. Hopefully, this walk-through helps to understand why I’ve come to this conclusion. However, just because I’ve decided I’m probably not going to use VCs in this way doesn’t mean you shouldn’t. Just like any technology, some tradeoffs occur when deciding how you approach your system design. It may be the case that this is the simplest method to achieve your use case. If that’s true then by all means go for it. However, I suspect things can be simplified through the use of <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/zcap-ld/">ZCAP-LD</a>. ZCAP-LD is built on the concept of an object capabilities model which is well suited for authorization systems (but not for making claims about a subject). I’ll be writing up a follow-up blog on how the same use case described above could be designed with ZCAP-LD and show the differences between the two. Be on the lookout for that to come next!</p>

 Common Delegation Patterns in the Verifiable Credential Ecosystem 

<p>It’s commonly understood that verifiable credentials are a useful data model for expressing provenance and authority of data. In other words, they’re great for solving the “who says what” problem in a digital ecosystem. However, did you know that there are three ways in which you can utilize VCs and DIDs to enable delegation and attenuated delegation for more complex scenarios? In this blog post, I’ll cover the three patterns you can use with examples to help you figure out some of the more advanced capabilities of the VC data model. See below for more details!</p>

 Terminology 

<p>Since it’s quite common to see these terms within the IAM space, I figured it would be useful to first cover what each term means in simple term.</p>

<p>Delegation: This is the ability for someone to share their abilities with another user within the system. There’s multiple ways this can be done all with different forms of tradeoffs.</p>

 
   
    <p>A user who shares their password with another user is performing delegation, but not in a way that allows an authorization endpoint (often times called a “verifier”) to be able to uniquely differentiate between the two users. This inability to differentiate at the authorization endpoint often leads to concerns around the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confused_deputy_problem">confused deputy problem</a>.</p>
   
   
    <p>This when the system has been designed to allow the user to share their abilities with another user. The most common way this shows up today is with google document links. When a user “allows anyone with this link to view/comment/edit” they’re granting abilites to other users in a delegated way. The difference being the system can identify these unique users, which is commonly seen via the further delegation based upon an email address or organization.</p>
   
 

<p>Attenuated delegation: This is when the user opts to share only a portion of the abilities that they have. So looking at our options from delegation, option 1 would not allow this because the user is sharing all the same abilities that they have when logging into an account. So if an admin shares their password, the person they share the password with has admin abilities as well. One of the more common examples I can think of when attenuated delegation that is in use today is when a valet key is given to a valet. This key gives the valet access to drive the vehicle, but doesn’t allow them to open a glovebox or trunk for example. In this case, the driver of the vehichle is able to share only a portion of their abilities (driving) without sharing all of their abilities (opening a glovebox or trunk). In almost every system I’ve seen, this has to be intentionally designed into the system.</p>

 Delegation without attenuation by using DID Documents 

<p>As an example, let’s say we have the two following DID Documents:</p>

<p>Alice’s DID Document:</p>

   <code>{
    "@context": [
        "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
        "https://w3id.org/security/suites/ed25519-2020/v1"
    ],
    "id": "did:example:alice",
    "verificationMethod": [
        {
            "id": "did:example:alice#aliceKey1",
            "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2020",
            "controller": "did:example:alice",
            "publicKeyMultibase": "zH3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV"
        },
        {
            "id": "did:example:bob#bobKey1",
            "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2020",
            "controller": "did:example:bob",
            "publicKeyMultibase": "z9hFgmPVfmBZwRvFEyniQDBkz9LmV7gDEqytWyGZLmDXE"
        }
    ],
    "assertionMethod": [
        "did:example:alice#aliceKey1",
        "did:example:bob#bobKey1"
    ]
}
</code>   

<p>Bob’s DID Document:</p>

   <code>{
    "@context": [
        "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
        "https://w3id.org/security/suites/ed25519-2020/v1"
    ],
    "id": "did:example:bob",
    "verificationMethod": [
        {
            "id": "did:example:bob#bobKey1",
            "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2020",
            "controller": "did:example:bob",
            "publicKeyMultibase": "z9hFgmPVfmBZwRvFEyniQDBkz9LmV7gDEqytWyGZLmDXE"
        }
    ],
    "assertionMethod": ["did:example:bob#bobKey1"]
}
</code>   

<p>In this example we can see that Alice has the capability to delegate to Bob the ability for him to assert on her behalf.
In the case of the following VC, bob could then create a valid verifiable presentation based on the following verifiable
credential that was delegated to him:</p>

   <code>{

<p>This effectively is a method to allow Alice to add bob’s public key to her did document and giving him a copy of the verifiable credential to delegate him to act on her behalf. However, because this pattern relies on Alice granting Bob full authority to perform any action on her behalf, it lacks attenuation, but does have delegation.</p>

 Delegation by VCs 

<p>Additionally, there’s a well documented case to be able to establish delegation using just VCs without the ability to attenuate the data. See <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/#subject-passes-a-verifiable-credential-to-someone-else">Section Appendix C.5</a> for more details on this pattern.</p>

 Attenuated Delegation by VCs 

<p>Further, by combining the pattern described in <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/#subject-passes-a-verifiable-credential-to-someone-else">Section Appendix C.5</a> and combining it with the usage of a selective disclosure scheme like BBS signatures, we can enable an attenuated delegation pattern.</p>

<p>This is done via modifying the type of proof used to sign the credential and then utilizing the selective disclosure to limit the data. Using the following original verifiable credential:</p>

   <code>{
    "@context": [
        "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
        "https://w3id.org/citizenship/v1",

 Conclusion 

<p>So there’s a few different take aways from this that should be highlighted. First and foremost VCs and DIDs have some really interesting capabilities that enable delegation and attenuated delegation. However, it’s not always advantageous and requires thorough understanding of the use case that’s trying to be built with DIDs and VCs and whether or not delegation needs to be enabled or disabled. In some cases, it’s being left in when there’s an expectation that a credential is only able to be used by a single holder. Finally, it should be noted that while VCs are capable of being used for authorization systems, it’s generally not a good idea to do so. This is because the complexity (based on the number of checks) of the authorization system is quite high and the semantics have not been designed in a way that align well with most authorization systems meaning a vulnerability is more likely to be introduced. If you’re looking for these capabilities, I would recommend you look to the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/zcap-ld/">ZCAP-LD data model</a> which is designed especially for these concepts. And if you’re still confused and would like some help please reach out and I can see how I can help.</p>

  <p>Summary:      The self-sovereign internet underscores a tension between those who desire perfect oversight of society and those who desire perfect privacy. In this post, I explore a method for conditional legibility of private communications.</p>



<p>
    In <a href="https://blockchain.tno.nl/blog/self-sovereign-communication/">Self-Sovereign Communication</a>, Oskar Van Deventer, discusses the communications layer enabled by DIDs. This is the same layer that I've labeled the self-sovereign internet.
</p>

<p>
    Oskar lays out nine requirements for self-sovereign communications (emphasis added):
</p>

 
     The communication channel shall be usable for machine-readable issuer-holder-verifier interactions . 
     The communication channel shall be protected against eavesdropping, impersonation, message modification and repudiation. 
     Parties shall be able to digitally find each other and to establish a communication channel. 
     The communication channel between counterparties shall be persistent. 
     The communication channel shall be intrinsically symmetrical. 
     The communication channel shall not unnecessarily disclose information between counterparties or to third parties. 
     The communication channel shall be unilaterally closable. 
     The communication channel shall not depend on third parties more than needed. 
     The communication channel shall enable compliance with legal requirements, like legal intercept. 
 

<p>I was pleased to see these principles laid out clearly because many of them are often discussed (including by me) as properties of DIDComm, without the precision Oskar imposes.</p>
<p>The last, as Oskar concedes, is likely to be the most controversial. Indeed, when I read it my first reaction was to start arguing. If complying with legal requirements means creating backdoors to DIDComm, I'd oppose it.</p>
<p>The problem with backdoors for complying with legal requirements is that now developers and cloud operators are left with the task of determining who the good guys are. The whole point of decentralized communication systems is to avoid the kind of centralized, single-point-of-failure that backdoors imply.</p>

<a></a>
 Reciprocal Negotiated Accountability 

<p>
    In <a href="https://www.evernym.com/blog/a-call-for-reciprocal-negotiated-accountability/">Reciprocal Negotiated Accountability</a>, Daniel Hardman proposes an alternative to backdoors.
</p>

<p>Daniel's idea is to combine two capabilities to create a decentralized system for enabling accountability.</p>
<p>The first is digital watermarks and data terms of service. The watermark is a cryptographically signed addition to the original document that states the terms behind the sharing. For example, a sales agreement could include data sharing terms that state the recipient may not disclose named aspects of the document except under legal subpoena.</p>
<p>The second is provisional anonymity where identifying information is encrypted and the encrypted packaged is shared with the recipient. The keys to decrypt the identifying information are shared with a third party under escrow with legal requirements that the keys only be reveled to the recipient under specific conditions.</p>
<p>Daniel combines these into a decentralized system of opt-in agreements between parties that are tailored to the context and circumstances of the specific communications channel and data sharing. The legal agreement defines the requirements that must be met for access.</p>
<p>Daniel calls this "reciprocal negotiated accountability" because both parties negotiate an agreement about how shared data will be treated.</p>
<p>Daniel's solution won't make those who wish for unfettered access to communications channels happy. But it represents an alternative to backdoors that solves many of the problems backdoors present while protecting privacy for legitimate uses–as negotiated by the parties sharing data.</p>

  <p>Summary: I'm attended the Hyperledger Global Forum this last week–all virtual. I spoke on DIDComm and the Self-Sovereign Internet. If you're not up to speed with DIDComm and how it creates a secure overlay network on TCP/IP, you should be. I consider it one of the most important things to come out of the SSI movement.</p>


DIDs and DID-based Communication or DIDComm form the second layer of the SSI stack, providing a secure communications layer for the exchange of identity information via verifiable credentials. But, because of it's flexibility and the ability to define protocols on top of DIDComm messaging, it promises to be as important as the identity layer it enables. 

<a></a>
 Autonomic Identifiers 

<p>
    The foundation of the self-sovereign internet is built on <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml">autonomic identifiers</a>. I'm going to speak about Peer DIDs here, but KERI and other systems provide autonomic identifiers that serve just as well.
</p>

<p>
    Identity systems provide the means to remember, recognize, and rely on other parties in a relationship. To do so, they use identifiers, convenient handles that name the thing being remembered.
</p>

<p>
    Identifiers are issued to or created by a controller (e.g. Alice) who, by virtue of knowing the authentication factors (e.g. password, key fob, cryptographic key), can make authoritative statements about the identifier (e.g. claim it by logging in).
</p>


	<a></a>
	Bindings between Alice, a Peer DID, and the public key it points to. (click to enlarge)


<p>
    In an autonomic identity architecture, the controller, Alice, generates a public-private key pair, derives a globally unique identifier, and shares the identifier and the currently associated public key with others to create relationships. Alice uses her private key to sign statements that authenticate herself and authorize use of the identifier. A digital signature also provides the means for Alice to cryptographically respond to challenges so she can prove she controls the identifier. These self-authentication and self-authorization capabilities make the identifier self-certifying and self-managing, meaning that there is no external third party, not even a ledger, needed for Alice to manage and use the identifier and prove to others the integrity of the bindings between herself and the identifier.
</p>

<p>
    Any entity can create and establish control over an identifier in a manner that is independent, interoperable, and portable without recourse to any central authority. Autonomic identity systems rely solely on self-sovereign authority.
</p>

<p>
    Alice can create as many Peer DIDs as she needs, each pointing to a public key that Alice controls. Alice can rotate the keys underneath the Peer DID anytime without impacting the identifier or her ability to prove she controls it. She keeps track of these key events in a key event log. The key event log is a chain of signed change records that can be cryptographically verified. Alice can use it to prove the provenance of her control of the identifier from its inception to the present.
</p>

<a></a>
 Peer DID Exchange  

<p>
    Alice can exchange Peer DIDs with Bob to create a relationship. Because DIDs are associated with public keys, the exchange ensures that Alice and Bob have each other's public keys. They share key event logs (using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type">CRDT</a>) for each identifier. If either updates the keys associated with the DID, the other is informed of change.
</p>


	<a></a>
	Alice and Bob exchange Peer DIDs to create a relationship (click to enlarge)


<p>
    Having exchanged DIDs, Alice and Bob can now exchange signed and encrypted messages with each other using DIDComm. <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0005-didcomm">DIDComm is a messaging protocol</a> that rides on top of this Peer DID relationship.
</p>


	<a></a>
	Alice and Bob use DIDComm to exchange messages (click to enlarge)




<p>
    Alice and Bob are using digital wallets to store the keys (and manage their key event logs). The DIDComm messages are being exchanged using software agents that understand the DIDComm messaging protocol and use the keys in the wallet.
</p>

<p>
    Alice can have DID-based relationships with multiple people, organizations, and even things. Each relationship includes a secure DIDComm-based messaging capability.
</p>


	<a></a>
	Some of Alice's Relationships (click to enlarge)


<p>
    This network of DID-based relationships forms an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlay_network">overlay network</a>. An overlay network comprises virtual links that correspond to a path in the underlying network. Secure overlay networks rely on an identity layer based on asymmetric key cryptography to ensure message integrity, non-repudiation, and confidentiality.
</p>

<p>
    DIDComm messaging has several important properties that, taken together, provide a generative, secure network overlay for the Internet.
</p>

 
     Secure - DID-based relationships are mutually authenticating. 
     Private - messages can be encrypted. 
     Interoperable - messages can be exchanged between any agents that support the DIDComm protocol. 
     Transport-agnostic - DIDComm does not rely on any specific network technology–it is as happy on Bluetooth as on TCP/IP or anything else. 
     Extensible - DIDComm is designed to support other protocols riding on top of its general secure messaging infrastructure. 
 

<a></a>
 Protocological Power 

<p>
    The extensibility of DIDComm is one of its most powerful features because it makes DIDComm generative–just like the Internet itself.
</p>
<p>
    Protocols describe the rules for a set of interactions, specifying the kinds of interactions that can happen without being overly prescriptive about their nature or content. Protocols formalize workflows for specific interactions like ordering food at a restaurant, playing a game, or applying for college.
</p>
<p>
    The <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs">Hyperledger Aries project has a collection of RFCs</a> that describe protocols for DIDComm messaging. While we have come to think of SSI agents being strictly about exchanging peer DIDs to create a connection, request and issue a credential, or prove things using credentials, these are merely specific protocols defined to run over the DIDComm messaging protocol. The follow specifications describe the protocols for these three core applications of DIDComm:

    Daniel Hardman has provided a comprehensive tutorial on defining protocols on DIDComm. One of the Aries RFCs is sample protocol definition of a protocol for playing TicTacToe over DIDComm messaging.

<p>
    The TicTacToe protocol defines types of messages that are allowed, the game state, and what messages are allowed in each game state. I recommend it as a way to understand DIDComm protocols since it's familiar and easy to understand. Bruce Conrad who works on <a href="https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/overview?mode=global">picos</a> with me <a href="https://github.com/Picolab/TicTacToe/blob/master/README.md">implemented the TicTacToe protocol for picos</a>, which act as DIDComm agents.

 Generativity 

<p>
    In 2005, Jonathan Zittrain wrote a compelling and prescient examination of the generative capacity of the Internet and its tens of millions of attached PCs<a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/9385626/Zittrain_Generative%20Internet.pdf"></a>. Zittrain defined generativity thus:
</p>

<blockquote>Generativity denotes a technology's overall capacity to produce unprompted change driven by large, varied, and uncoordinated audiences.
     From <a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/9385626/Zittrain_Generative%20Internet.pdf">The Generative Internet</a><br>Referenced 2021-06-14T13:41:18-0600
     </blockquote>

<p>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_systems">Generative systems</a> use a few basic rules, structures, or features to yield behaviors that can be extremely varied and unpredictable. Zittrain goes on to lay out the criteria for evaluating the generativity of a technology:
</p>

<blockquote>
    Generativity is a function of a technology's capacity for leverage across a range of tasks, adaptability to a range of different tasks, ease of mastery, and accessibility.
</blockquote>

<p>
    I have <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/12/the_generative_self-sovereign_internet.shtml">made the case elsewhere that the self-sovereign internet meets Zittrain's criteria for generativity</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Generativity provides decentralized actors with the ability to create cooperating, complex structures and behavior. No one person or group can or will think of all the possible uses, but each is free to adapt the system to their own use. The architecture of the self-sovereign internet enables adaptation of DIDComm messaging to any circumstance.
</p>

<p>
    I am bullish on the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/01/generative_identity.shtml">possibilities for verifiable credentials</a> to allow people to live digital lives with dignity and effectiveness, addresses the problems of social inclusion, and support economic equality to everyone around the globe. With all that, I believe the possibilities for the self-sovereign internet are even larger, promising a more secure and private, albeit no less useful, internet for tomorrow. DIDComm may turn out to be the most important part of self-sovereign identity.

that there is no appeals process, that’s the end of me and my e-mail. The end
of a 20-year-long record of all important things I wrote to others and they wrote

<p>But even if everything is fine, and I don’t forget my passwords and don’t get
hacked and won’t get locked out: it’s a bit like being a really unimportant guest
living in a fancy hotel on a short-term lease. They can kick me out any time, and
keep all my furniture and other possessions, no questions asked. Thank you, I
prefer my very own home, where nobody can kick me out, or at least renter
protection laws, which don’t exist online.</p>

Illustration: Digital Identity&nbsp;Wallet<p>This article explains what a wallet is, how it works and how you can use it for managing your digital identity. While there are also wallets for institutions, this article only focuses on wallets for end users. The article also takes into consideration the revised eIDAS regulation including the ‘European Digital Identity&nbsp;Wallet’.</p> An Introduction <p>A digital wallet is a key management application, which provides a user with a graphical interface to store, manage and secure digital keys. These keys can be used to sign transactions, statements, credentials, documents or&nbsp;claims.</p><p>A digital identity wallet enables a user to establish relationships and interact with third parties in a trusted manner. While the wallet aspect is mainly dealing with key management, storage aspects and the graphical interface (UI = User Interface), the third party interactions are rather organised by your agent, which is a part of your wallet. Your agent handles third-party interactions in your name and acts in your interest. It is a piece of software, which helps you to stay in control of your messaging, security, health records, privacy, purchases etc.</p> A digital identity wallet based on self-sovereign identity (SSI) principles. <p>Not all wallets are the same! A wallet is a piece of technology, which can be implemented in different ways. While it can leverage decentralised identifiers (DIDs) and verified credentials, it doesn’t necessarily need to follow the principles of SSI. There are cloud wallets, which are hosted and provided by a third party. A good comparison is a wallet for cryptocurrencies — think of an exchange like Coinbase or Binance. These companies offer you a hosted wallet, which you don’t control. You might have the authentication means (password + second factor) to access your wallet, but it’s not yours. In this case, you are the owner, but not the possessor and you don’t have data sovereignty. This is in stark contrast to so-called self-custody wallets, which you install on your device. These wallets randomly create a private key, which only you know. The key point is that your wallet creates keys for you, which only you know and not a third&nbsp;party.</p><p>A digital identity wallet, which follows the <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">principles of SSI </a>enables the user to have data sovereignty and complete control as well as data portability. It provides you with the necessary autonomy to be independent of a third party. It not only enables ownership but also possession. It enables transparency and explicit consent when sharing information. It’s also vendor-independent, meaning you can export your data and import it into another wallet of your choice since it is built on open standards, which are widely used. It also creates peer identifiers for every new contact or rather an interaction, instead of getting an identifier assigned to&nbsp;it.</p> The core functions of an SSI&nbsp;wallet <p>Please note that the described characteristics below are not universally valid for all (SSI) wallets. It’s rather a desired&nbsp;status.</p>Interactions in an SSI ecosystem, picture by Adrian Doerk from&nbsp;Lissi.<p>Establish trusted relationships with third parties:<br>The wallet can create an encrypted communication channel to exchange information between you and a (trusted) third party. This communication channel is based on a unique identifier, which you control. Hence it is not hosted by a third party. This in turn enables you the portability of communication channels. Meaning if you switch from one wallet to another you can use the communication channels, which you already created without the reliance on any third-party platform.</p><p>Store, organise and present verified data:<br>The user can store and manage (verified) credentials among other information within the wallet. Once in the wallet, credentials can be used to answer a proof request from every connection. The wallet creates a verifiable presentation, which the user can choose to send or instead decline the proof request. Users are also able to verify the identity of the other party, effectively establishing a trusted relationship, which can be leveraged to share and receive information within a defined trust framework such as the eIDAS regulation. This trust might be based on an electronic seal or similar trust mechanisms. However, this might not be the case for all contacts.</p><p>The information exchanged can be verified, but can also be self-attested or just proof a certain threshold without revealing the exact information like your age when proofing you are 18 or&nbsp;older.</p><p>A transparent history of shared data:<br>Since the wallet usually keeps a history of interactions, the user can track who shared what data and when. This leads to greater transparency for the user and helps to better exercise data protection rights. A framework for the integration of detailed consent forms is currently under development.</p> Self-custody: With great control comes great responsibility <p>These digital wallets run locally as an application on the device of the user. From a technical perspective, these wallets are similar to self-custody wallets for cryptocurrencies. Similar to these wallets the user has the responsibility to do a&nbsp;backup.</p><p>Identification, authentication and authorization:<br>Before diving deeper into the core functions of a digital wallet we need to understand the differences between the three words above. The questions are from the perspective of the verifier or&nbsp;issuer.</p><p>Identification answers the question: “Who is I’m talking to?”<br>Authentication answers the question: “Is it you (whom I’ve identified already) again?”<br>Authorization answers the question: “What rights do I want to grant&nbsp;you?”</p><p>The wallet can enable a variety of additional functions and thus serves as a central point for the user to manage and access services. For example, the wallet can be used to replace traditional authentication methods such as passwords with a single sign-on (SSO) functionality. Furthermore, existing standards such as the OpenID Connect protocol can also be connected to enable communication with existing infrastructure. Hence, once widespread adopted the wallet will completely replace passwords for you and enable you to identify and authenticate yourself, identity third-parties as well as authorise third-parties to use your data according to your permissions.</p> The European Digital Identity&nbsp;Wallet Illustration: European Digital Identity&nbsp;Wallet<p>The main regulation within the European Union, which addresses the topic of identification (among other topics) is the regulation on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market better known as eIDAS regulation. The regulation just went through a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-digital-identity">major revision and now includes several aspects regarding self-sovereign identities</a> in its draft version. It also includes the aspect of a European Digital Identity Wallet, which “is a product and service that allows the user to store identity data, credentials and attributes linked to her/his identity, to provide them to relying parties on request and to use them for authentication, online and offline, for a service in accordance with Article 6a; and to create qualified electronic signatures and&nbsp;seals”.</p><p>In the following, the European Digital Identity Wallet is referred to as “EU Wallet” for simplicity.</p> Functions of the EU&nbsp;Wallet: <p>It should technically enable the selective disclosure of attributes to relying parties. Member States should also reach an agreement on common elements of a business model and fee structure of the EU Wallets. The EU Wallet will furthermore enable citizens to create qualified electronic signatures that can facilitate political participation among other functions.</p> EU Wallets shall enable the user&nbsp;to:   securely request and obtain, store, select, combine and share, in a manner that is transparent to and traceable by the user, the necessary legal personal identification data and electronic attestation of attributes to authenticate online and offline to use online public and private services;  sign statements or contracts utilising qualified electronic signatures (QES)  have full control of the EU Wallet. The issuer of the EU Wallet shall not collect information about the use of the EU Wallet which are not necessary for the provision of the EU Wallet&nbsp;service.  use it free of charge (natural persons).  access the wallet for persons with disabilities.   The EU Wallets shall provide a common interface:   to qualified and non-qualified trust service providers issuing qualified and non-qualified electronic attestations of attributes.  for relying parties to request and validate personal identification data and electronic attestations of attributes.  for the presentation to relying parties of personal identification data, electronic attestation of attributes or other data such as credentials, in local mode not requiring internet access for the&nbsp;wallet.   Furthermore, the EU Wallets need&nbsp;to:   ensure that trust service providers of qualified attestations of attributes cannot receive any information about the use of these attributes.  meet the requirements in regards to assurance level “high”, in particular as applied to the requirements for identity proofing and verification, and electronic identification means management and authentication.  provide a mechanism to ensure that the relying party is able to authenticate the user and to receive electronic attestations of attributes;  ensure that the personal identification data uniquely and persistently represent the natural or legal person is associated with&nbsp;it.   An EU Wallet shall be&nbsp;issued: <p>(a) by a Member State;<br>(b) under a mandate from a Member State;<br>(c) independently but recognised by a Member&nbsp;State.</p><p>The draft regulation requires Member States to issue a EU Wallet under a notified eID scheme to common technical standards following a compulsory compliance assessment and voluntary certification within the European cybersecurity certification framework, as established by the Cybersecurity Act.</p><p>Service providers should communicate their intent to rely on the EU Wallets to the Member States. Relying on the level of assurance “high”, the EU Wallets should benefit from the potential offered by tamper-proof solutions such as secure elements.</p><p>The conformity of EU Wallets should be certified by accredited public or private sector bodies designated by Member States. Certification should in particular rely on the relevant European cybersecurity certifications schemes. The EU Wallet Trust Mark’ means an indication in a simple, recognisable and clear manner that a EU Wallet has been issued in accordance with this Regulation.</p><p>The Commission shall establish, publish and maintain a list of certified European Digital Identity&nbsp;Wallets.</p> Where are heading? A personal&nbsp;opinion:   A wallet acts as a central point to manage interactions in a digital world. It will be the standard for identity management and be ubiquitous in everyday&nbsp;life.  Technology is moving fast. While standardisation is taking quite a while, institutions and governments have recognised the need for innovation in this area to secure data sovereignty and not be dependent on a foreign oligopoly of companies with irresponsible business practices.  Dozens of use-cases from different industries are explored in parallel and will be available in the upcoming&nbsp;months.  Over time digital wallets for pure identity management and financial applications (e.g. cryptocurrencies or central bank digital currencies (CBDC)) are likely to&nbsp;merge.  The draft of the revised eIDAS regulation of the European Union is the most comprehensive and ambitious step towards SSI internationally.  While the exact implementation and technical specifications of the EU Wallets are still to be determined, their compulsory issuance for the EU Member States as well as the compulsory acceptance for big platform providers will have a tremendous international impact.  Key management is an issue, which still needs to be solved. This means, the user also has the responsibility of having a secure backup solution to restore the wallet in case of lost&nbsp;access.

I’m calling it the Redux series. To qualify, these should still ring true today, or at least provide some history. This early one is still on the Web, <a href="http://buzzphraser.com/buzzstory.html">here</a> at <a href="http://buzzphraser.com/">BuzzPhraser.com</a>. I’ve made only two small edits, regarding dates. (And thanks to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/denisecaruso">Denise Caruso</a> for reminding me that this thing started out on paper, very long ago.)</p>
 
<p><a href="http://buzzphraser.com/"></a></p>
<p>The original <a href="http://buzzphraser.com/">BuzzPhraser</a> was created in 1990, or perhaps earlier, as a spreadsheet, then a HyperCard stack; and it quickly became one of the most-downloaded files on AOL and Compuserve. For years after that it languished, mostly because I didn’t want to re-write the software. But when the Web came along, I knew I had to find a way to re-create it. The means didn’t find that end, however, until&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thedance.net/">Charles Roth</a>&nbsp;grabbed the buzzwords by their serifs and made it happen, using a bit of clever Javascript. Once you start having fun with the new BuzzPhraser, I’m sure you’ll thank him as much as I do.</p>
<p>The story that follows was written for the original BuzzPhraser. I thought it would be fun to publish it unchanged.</p>
<p>—Doc, sometime in the late ’90s</p>
<p>BuzzPhrases are built with TechnoLatin, a non-language that replaces plain English nouns with vague but precise-sounding substitutes.&nbsp; In TechnoLatin, a disk drive is a “data management solution.”&nbsp; A network is a “workgroup productivity platform.”&nbsp; A phone is a “telecommunications device”.</p>
<p>The virtue of TechnoLatin is that it describes just about anything technical.&nbsp; The vice of TechnoLatin is that it really doesn’t mean anything.&nbsp; This is because TechnoLatin is comprised of words that are either meaningless or have been reduced to that state by frequent use.&nbsp; Like the blank tiles in Scrabble, you can put them anywhere, but they have no value.&nbsp; The real value of TechnoLatin is that it&nbsp;sounds&nbsp;precise while what it says is vague as air.&nbsp; And as easily inflated.</p>
<p>Thanks to TechnoLatin, today’s technology companies no longer make chips, boards, computers, monitors or printers.&nbsp; They don’t even make products.&nbsp; Today everybody makes “solutions” that are described as “interoperable,” “committed,” “architected,” “seamless” or whatever.&nbsp; While these words sound specific, they describe almost nothing.&nbsp; But where they fail as description they succeed as camouflage: they conceal meaning, vanish into surroundings and tend to go unnoticed.</p>
<p>Take the most over-used word in TechnoLatin today: solution.&nbsp; What the hell does “solution” really mean?&nbsp; Well, if you lift the camouflage, you see it usually means “product.”&nbsp; Try this: every time you run across “solution” in a technology context, substitute “product.”&nbsp; Note that the two are completely interchangeable.&nbsp; The difference is, “product” actually means something, while “solution” does not.&nbsp; In fact, the popularity of “solution” owes to its lack of specificity.&nbsp; While it presumably suggests the relief of some “problem,” it really serves only to distance what it labels from the most frightening risk of specificity: the clarity of actual limits.</p>
<p>The fact is, most vendors of technology products don’t like to admit that their creations are limited in any way.&nbsp; Surely, a new spreadsheet — the labor of many nerd/years — is something&nbsp;more&nbsp;than “just a spreadsheet.”&nbsp; But what?&nbsp; Lacking an available noun, it’s easy to build a suitable substitute with TechnoLatin.&nbsp; Call it an “executive information matrix.”&nbsp; Or a “productivity enhancement engine.”&nbsp; In all seriousness, many companies spend months at this exercise.&nbsp; Or even years.&nbsp; It’s incredible.</p>
<p>There is also a narcotic appeal to buzzphrasing in TechnoLatin.&nbsp; It makes the abuser feel as if he or she is really saying something, while in fact the practice only mystifies the listener or reader.&nbsp; And since buzzphrasing is so popular, it gives the abuser a soothing sense of conformity, like teenagers get when they speak slang.&nbsp; But, like slang, TechnoLatin feels better than it looks.&nbsp; In truth, it looks suspicious.&nbsp; And with good reason.&nbsp; TechnoLatin often does not mean what it says, because the elaborate buzzphrases it builds are still only approximations.</p>
<p>But who cares? Buzzphrasing is epidemic.&nbsp; You can’t get away from it.&nbsp; Everybody does it.&nbsp; There is one nice thing about Everybody, however: they’re a big market.</p>
<p>So, after studying this disease for many years, I decided, like any self-respecting doctor, to profit from the problem.&nbsp; And, like any self-respecting Silicon Valley entrepreneur, I decided to do this with a new product for which there was absolutely no proven need, in complete faith that people would buy it.&nbsp; Such is the nature of marketing in the technology business.</p>
<p>But, lacking the investment capital required to generate demand where none exists, I decided on a more generous approach: to give it away, in hope that even if I failed to halt the epidemic, at least I could get people to talk about it.</p>
<p>With this altruistic but slightly commercial goal in mind, I joined farces with Ray Miller of Turtlelips Services to create a product that would encourage and support the narcotic practice of buzzphrasing.&nbsp; Being the brilliant programmer he is, Ray hacked it into a stack in less time than it took for me to write this prose.&nbsp; And now here it is, free as flu, catching on all over the damn place.</p>
<p>What made BuzzPhraser possible as a product is that the practice of buzzphrasing actually has rules.&nbsp; Like English, TechnoLatin is built around nouns.&nbsp; It has adjectives to modify those nouns.&nbsp; And adverbs to modify the adjectives.&nbsp; It also has a class of nouns that modify other nouns — we call them “adnouns.”&nbsp; And it has a nice assortment of hyphenated prefixes and suffixes (such as “multi-” and “-driven”) that we call “hyphixes.”</p>
<p>Since the TechnoLatin lexicon is filled with meaningless words in all those categories, the words that comprise TechnoLatin buzzphrases can be assembled in just about any number or order, held together as if by velcro.&nbsp; These are the rules:</p>
 
 adverbs modify adjectives 
 adjectives modify adnouns, nouns or each other 
 adnouns modify nouns or other adnouns 
 nouns are modified by adnouns or adjectives 
 prefixes modify all adjectives 
 suffixes qualify all adnouns 
 
<p>Here is a diagram that shows how the rules work:</p>
<p></p>
<p>As with English, there are many exceptions.&nbsp; But, as with programming, we don’t make any.&nbsp; So cope with it.</p>
<p>With one adverb, one adjective, two adnouns, a noun and a prefix, you get “backwardly architected hyper-intelligent analysis inference leader.”&nbsp; With an adjective and two nouns, you get “interactive leverage module.”&nbsp; Put together buzzphrases of almost any shape and length:</p>
 
 “Breakthrough-capable technology market” 
 “Primarily distinguished optional contingency philosophy control power environment” 
 “Executive inference server” 
 “Evidently complete key business manipulation capacity method” 
 “Incrementally intelligent workgroup process topology vendor” 
 
<p>The amazing thing is that all of these sound, as we say in TechnoLatin, “virtually credible.”&nbsp; And one nice thing about the computer business is — thanks largely to the brain-softening results of prolonged TechnoLatin abuse — “virtually credible” is exactly what it means in plain English: close enough.</p>
<p>BuzzPhraser makes “close enough” easy to reach by substituting guesswork for thinking.&nbsp; Just keep hitting the button until the right buzzphrase comes along.&nbsp; Then use that buzzphrase in faith that at least it sounds like you know what you’re saying.&nbsp; And hey, in this business, isn’t that virtually credible?</p>

 This past week, the Colorado legislature passed the “Colorado Privacy Act”,
which makes Colorado the 3rd US state with modern privacy legislation,
following the CCPA in California
and the CDPA in Virginia.
It will start going into effect about 24 months from now. 
 Its provisions are similar to California’s and Virginia’s, except for

<p>This past week, the Colorado legislature passed the “Colorado Privacy Act”,
which makes Colorado the 3rd US state with modern privacy legislation,
following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Consumer_Privacy_Act">CCPA in California</a>
and the <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212+sum+HB2307">CDPA in Virginia</a>.
It will start going into effect about 24 months from now.</p>
<p>Its provisions are similar to California’s and Virginia’s, except for
this one, which goes substantially further:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A CONTROLLER THAT PROCESSES PERSONAL DATA FOR PURPOSES OF TARGETED ADVERTISING
OR THE SALE OF PERSONAL DATA SHALL ALLOW CONSUMERS TO EXERCISE THE RIGHT TO OPT
OUT OF THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING THE CONSUMER FOR
PURPOSES OF TARGETED ADVERTISING OR THE SALE OF PERSONAL DATA …
BY CONTROLLERS THROUGH A USER-SELECTED UNIVERSAL OPT-OUT MECHANISM THAT
MEETS THE TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS ESTABLISHED BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track">Do Not Track</a> – or
something very much like it – is back in Colorado, and ignoring the setting,
like companies did widely when Do Not Track was created, is not an option any more.
The technical details will need to be figured out between now and when this
provision goes into effect, which two and a half years away. So plenty of
time to get this right.</p>
<p>Progress! Which US state is next? The IAPP has a
<a href="https://iapp.org/media/pdf/resource_center/State_Comp_Privacy_Law.pdf">great chart</a> showing

<p>In the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-ed/">W3C VC-EDU</a> call on June 7, 2021 we discussed <a href="https://openbadges.org/">Open Badges</a> asserted as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a> (VCs). This call began the public discussion of Open Badges as Native VCs (potentially as Open Badges 3.0) to inform the IMS Open Badges Working Group. Why are we discussing this? Why does it matter? How will it work? Feedback from folks in the community have suggested that it would be helpful to answer these questions first from a conceptual standpoint. In a later post, we can outline what the structural changes could look&nbsp;like.</p><p>Open Badges are digital credentials that can recognize learning, achievements, and even memberships. They look like an image, but inside the image are metadata properties (it works much like how digital photos have metadata properties that explain the data of the photo, location, etc. so that when the photo is uploaded, applications understand the data). The metadata describes why the badge was issued, when, the recipient (typically an email address), the description and criteria of the achievement, and, critically, how this digital credential can be verified.</p><p>The verification of an Open Badge is dependent on the Issuer of the badge. It can be done in one of two&nbsp;ways:</p>  <a href="https://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/Badges/OBv2p0Final/index.html#HostedBadge">Hosted Verification</a> — One of the metadata properties of an Open Badges is the assertion id which is a URL that hosts the metadata in a&nbsp;.json file. If that URL can’t be found, then the badge is not verifiable  <a href="https://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/Badges/OBv2p0Final/index.html#SignedBadge">Signed Verification</a> — An Issuer can digitally sign the metadata of a badge. This uses cryptography to ensure that the badge data has not changed and that the issuer was the entity that issued the badge. The public key used to sign the badge must be traceable back to the&nbsp;issuer.  <p>Primarily, Open Badges platforms are issuing hosted badges. This means the verifying party is dependent on the issuer to host the data. Also, the issuer has some ability to track when the badge data has been accessed and potentially by who (or at least by IP address).</p><p>For 99% of the badges that have been issued to date, this is fine. In fact, badges are often shared via web pages that attractively display the image and data (not by the&nbsp;.json files that contain the data or the baked image with the data inside). So while Open Badges are both human readable and machine readable, the human readable approach is what is used most often. Signed badges are closer to Verifiable Credentials because they also rely on cryptographic proof.</p><p>Neither of these approaches give learners control of their data and this is the overall conceptual shift between Open Badges 2.0 and Open Badges as Verifiable Credentials.</p><p>Verifiable Credentials, like signed Open Badges, are signed by the issuer and verified cryptographically. Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) can be used to identify the issuer and recipient (using DIDs in Open Badges 2.0 has been prototyped). Also, Verifiable Credentials have a concept called “Presentations” which can be digitally signed by the recipient to prove that they are the recipient of the verifiable credential(s) being presented. All in all, this means that the issuer is verified and also the recipient.</p><p>Verifiable Credentials can be displayed, shared, and presented from wallet applications that are web, mobile, or desktop based (most are mobile right now). Recipients can present one or more of their credentials to verifying third-parties who can verify the credentials without depending on the issuers and consume the data. Not only can the participant manage which credentials are being verified, they can control what aspects of their data are being&nbsp;shared.</p><p>For example, a student’s digital wallet may contain a digital passport, an Open Badge representing a completed course, and an Open Badge representing a student ID (all as Verifiable Credentials). A relying third-party, such as a potential employer seeking to fill an internship role, may need to verify that a student is over 18, has completed a course on communication, and is a current student. The employer’s website application can ask the student to provide this discrete information using their wallet and the student can do this without revealing any of the other information in those credentials like their date of birth, address, photo, or even the name of the school they attend. And all of this information can be verified without contacting the issuers of those credentials. Open Badges 2.0 can’t do&nbsp;this.</p><p>Verifiable Credentials put learners in the center of a trust triangle with issuers and verifiers. They also add an additional layer of verification for the recipients. Open Badges can take advantage of this, be the first education-focused digital credential spec to promote personal protection of and access to data, and be part of the growing ecosystem that is exchanging Verifiable Credentials.</p><p>It’s worth noting that the human readable aspect of Open Badges would not change in a VC version. Issuers can still display web pages for the issued badges and allow recipients to share their badges online from those pages. The difference being that those web pages would not be reliant on for machine verification or consumption.</p><p>Join us for this continuing discussion in the next VC-EDU call this coming Monday June 14 (and most Mondays) at 8am PDT / 11am EDT / 4pm BST / 5pm CEST. This call is public and all are welcome to join.

<p>This article shows how integration tests could be implemented for an ASP.NET Core application which uses <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/providers/cosmos/">EF Core</a> and Azure <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/">Cosmos</a>. The database tests can be run locally or in an Azure DevOps build using the Azure Cosmos emulator. <a href="https://xunit.net/">XUnit </a>is used to implement the tests.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCoreEfCoreCosmosTesting">https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCoreEfCoreCosmosTesting</a></p>



<p>EF Core is used to the access Azure Cosmos database. An EF Core DbContext was created to access Cosmos. This is like any EF Core context, with the DBSet definitions as required. Some Cosmos specific definitions are added using the OnModelCreating method. See the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/providers/cosmos/#cosmos-specific-model-customization">Cosmos-specific model customization</a> for more details.</p>


   public class CosmosContext : DbContext
    {
        public CosmosContext(DbContextOptions&lt;CosmosContext&gt; options) 
          : base(options) { }

        public DbSet&lt;MyData&gt; MyData { get; set; }

        protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
        {
            modelBuilder.HasDefaultContainer("MyDataStore");

            modelBuilder.Entity&lt;MyData&gt;()
                .ToContainer("MyDataItems");

            modelBuilder.Entity&lt;MyData&gt;()
                .HasPartitionKey(o =&gt; o.PartitionKey);

            modelBuilder.Entity&lt;MyData&gt;()
                .Property(d =&gt; d.ETag)
                .IsETagConcurrency();
        }
    }
  


<p>The MyData class is is used to model the Cosmos documents. This has a PartitionKey and also an ETag which can be used for the Optimistic concurrency validation.</p>


  public class MyData
{
	public string Id { get; set; }
	public string PartitionKey { get; set; }
	public string Name { get; set; }
	public string Description { get; set; }
	public string ETag { get; set; }
}
  


<p>The MyDataService service class is used to access the context and implement some query logic as required. I like to keep this simple and not separate the specification of the queries from the the business or the Linq statements. This reduces the amount of code and keeps the data access, business simple and makes it easy to adapt.</p>


  public class MyDataService
{
	private CosmosContext _cosmosContext;

	public MyDataService(CosmosContext cosmosContext)
	{
		_cosmosContext = cosmosContext;
	}

	public void EnsureCreated()
	{
		_cosmosContext.Database.EnsureCreated();
	}

	public async Task CreateAsync(MyData myData)
	{
		await _cosmosContext.MyData.AddAsync(myData);
		await _cosmosContext.SaveChangesAsync(false);
	}

	public async Task&lt;MyData&gt; Get(string id)
	{
		return await _cosmosContext.MyData.FirstAsync(d =&gt; d.Id == id);
	}

	public async Task&lt;IList&lt;MyData&gt;&gt; NameContains(string name)
	{
		return await _cosmosContext.MyData
			.Where(d =&gt; d.Name.Contains(name)).ToListAsync();
	}
}
  


<p>The ConfigureServices method adds the services required to use EF Core and Cosmos DB. The services are used in a Razor page application, but this could be any web application, ASP.NET Core API or ASP.NET Core Blazor.</p>


  public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
        {
            services.AddDbContext&lt;CosmosContext&gt;(options =&gt;
            {
                options.UseCosmos(
                   "AccountEndpoint=https://localhost:8081/;AccountKey=C2y6yDjf5/R+ob0N8A7Cgv30VRDJIWEHLM+4QDU5DE2nQ9nDuVTqobD4b8mGGyPMbIZnqyMsEcaGQy67XIw/Jw==",
                    databaseName: "MyDataDb"
               );
            });

            services.AddScoped&lt;MyDataService&gt;();
            services.AddRazorPages();
        }
  


<p>The service needs to be tested. Instead of mocking away the database or using separate specifications classes as parameters, the service can be tested as one using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/local-emulator">Azure Cosmos emulator</a> and EF Core. We used the framework tools to test our code. An EF Core in-memory database could also be used instead of the Azure Cosmos emulator. We use the emulator for these tests. </p>



<p></p>



<p>The tests are setup to add the services to the IoC and build these. The code can be run and asserted as required. To start locally in dev, the Azure Cosmos emulator needs to be started first.</p>

<p>The integration tests can be run in the Azure DevOps CI. I used a yaml file to test this and added this to my Azure DevOps build. This was a little bit tricky to setup because I did not easily find any working docs. The Microsoft.Azure.CosmosDB.Emulator is installed and started using Powershell. Then the tests can be run. </p>

<p>You can add the yaml pipeline to your Azure DevOps build and it will run like the triggers are defined or the Azure DevOps policies.</p>







<p>This works good, but you have to be careful in preparing the tests and running in parallel. Implementing the tests like this means you have less code in your application and you can still fully test all your code. A disadvantage with this approach is that the tests take longer to run compared to unit tests without the emulator.</p>

<p>A simple technology invented by Bell Labs over 20 years ago (and widely used today) could have prevented the Colonial Pipeline attack.</p> <p></p> <p>In 1880, the French government awarded Alexander Graham Bell roughly the equivalent of $300K as a prize for inventing the telephone. He used the award to fund the research laboratory that became colloquially known as Bell Labs. If you’re not familiar with Bell Labs, you should be. In the 140+ years that followed, researchers at <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/">Bell Labs</a>invented radio astronomy, transistors, lasers, solar cells, information theory, and UNIX, just to name a few of the many accomplishments. Among the many prestigious <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/about/awards/">awards</a>granted to Bell Labs researchers are nine Nobel prizes and twenty-two IEEE Medals of Honor.</p> <p>In 1998, I joined <a href="https://about.att.com/sites/labs_research">AT&amp;T Labs</a>, which was a research group that the company retained when they spun out most of Bell Labs to Lucent Technologies in 1996. I was a Web Application developer; one of the least technical roles in the Labs. If I ever thought for a moment that I knew technology, I was quickly humbled when I built an app that tracked the Labs' actually importantprojects. The experience of working in the Labs stuck with me in the form of humility and curiosity. I accepted that I may never be the foremost expert in any given technology and I assumed the mindset of a forever student. Even today, I constantly question what I think I know because there are always holes in my knowledge or perspectives that I haven’t seen.</p> <p>1998 was the same year that researchers at AT&amp;T Labs were issued a patent (filed in 1995)  for what became known in our industry as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). As a Product Manager at a tech firm, I don’t review patents for legal reasons. But I recently saw an excerpt of the abstract for the AT&amp;T patent and there was one line that I found entertaining: “A preferred method of alerting the customer and receiving a confirmation to authorize the transaction back from the customer is illustratively afforded by conventional two-way pagers.” Not much has changed in 23 years. Pagers have been largely replaced by SMS but text messaging through the telecom provider’s network remains one of the most popular delivery mechanisms for MFA (despite some <a href="https://www.nist.gov/blogs/cybersecurity-insights/questionsand-buzz-surrounding-draft-nist-special-publication-800-63-3">potential security flaws</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>I have no personal insight into AT&amp;T’s motivations at the time, but I read Kevin Mitnick’s book a few years ago (<a href="https://www.mitnicksecurity.com/ghost-in-the-wires">Ghost in the Wires</a>) and can’t help but wonder if AT&amp;T was at the forefront of developing security technologies because they were such a target of hackers for so many years. I also reached out to Steve Greenspan, one of the inventors named in the patent to get his thoughts on the project. He noted:<br></p><p>"Two-way pagers had just come out (1994-1995), and our cybersecurity  friends were debating whether quantum computing would undermine  password-based security. The goal was to explore business applications for  two-way pagers and to put humans in-the-loop for secure access." <br></p><p>Quantum computing is a a pretty interesting business driver for MFA, especially in the mid-1990's. The concern is even more relevant today as we inch closer to quantum compute becoming a practical reality. Today's authentication systems should store password data in non-reversible hashes (theoretically preventing the quantum threat), but it's clear that credentials are being stolen all the time (often via large databases that are just left unprotected) and MFA remains a top solution to mitigate the damage. Steve and team were clearly on the right track when they dreamed up out-of-band authentication and deserve some credit and recognition for the foresight.<br></p>You may be wondering how this relates to the pipeline attack that led to fuel shortages across the U.S. East Coast. Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-04/hackers-breached-colonial-pipeline-using-compromised-password">reported</a>that the Colonial Pipeline, which is the largest fuel pipeline in the country, was taken down by a single compromised password. That should never happen given the variety of tools available to limit and control access, starting with MFA – a relatively simple solution that would likely have prevented the attack. The entry point to the system was a Virtual Private Network (VPN) account. If you’re using a VPN and expose anything sensitive inside the VPN, you should implement strong authentication that includes at least two authentication factors (something you know, something you have, something you are). These are widely available technologies that are very effective against lost or stolen credentials.    <p>Of course, authentication isn’t the end of the story. Today’s widely distributed and highly dynamic environments require multiple layers of security. We all know how popular email and phishing attacks have become. It only takes one person inside a network to open an email, click a link, or logon to a phishing site to give an adversary a foothold in the network. We have to assume that will happen and build layers of strong security between any one user and the potential targets.</p>   <p>To illustrate the point, here’s a quick example:</p>   <p>Grocery stores who sell small, high-value items have traditionally struggled with theft. (Ask me over a beer sometime about how I helped take down a recurring thief when I worked at a grocery store.) If the only answer was to authenticate users (check ID) on the way into the store, it wouldn't be enough. Once inside, someone can still pocket items and walk out without paying. If you walk into a grocery store today, you’ll see cameras in the healthcare aisle where small, expensive medications line the shelves. But that’s not enough either. Each item is also locked in an anti-theft device that’s removed at the register. And some items are found in a locked cabinet that requires employee assistance. Theft still happens, but each layer reduces the risk. Our IT environments are much more complicated in terms of the various pathways to theft and our responses to reduce risk typically require more than a few layers of security.</p>   <p>Sensitive data should only be stored in a secure area of the network with access controls and Least Privilege enforcement. Access should be limited to specific hosts or networks. Data should be encrypted (inside the file when possible - so if the file is stolen, the data is still unusable). There should be strong authentication to get into the network and monitoring of all activity. There should be alerts on unusual behavior and Data Loss Prevention (DLP) to evaluate the sensitivity of data moving across the network. The environment should be scanned regularly for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. And on and on. Any one of these security mechanisms alone is not enough. This multi-layered approach to security is critical in developing a strong security posture that minimizes risk.</p>   <p>We could argue about where to start or which security controls are most important. But, it seems like a no-brainer to implement MFA for employees accessing corporate data and applications. Microsoft, who deals with 300 million fraudulent sign-in attempts daily <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2019/08/20/one-simple-action-you-can-take-to-prevent-99-9-percent-of-account-attacks/">concluded</a>that “MFA can block over 99.9 percent of account compromise attacks.”That sounds about right. While targeted attacks have increased in prevalence, most attacks are not targeted at specific companies or individuals. Most start with automated scripting or broad-scale phishing attacks that span across potentially thousands of companies and/or millions of people at the same time. When a foothold is found (a script finds a vulnerability or an open port, a user enters credentials into the phishing site, etc.), the attack begins. Implementing a few simple security technologies like automated vulnerability scanning and MFA can prevent most attacks before they begin. Even if a sophisticated phishing attack succeeds despite MFA, the credentials will not be very useful beyond the initial session (which should be limited in scope by other controls).</p>   <p>No single technology will solve all cybersecurity problems. But, implementing MFA is low-cost, easy-to-implement, and highly effective. It may even make life easier for end-users. Password requirements can be loosened because there’s less risk associated with cracked passwords. And there are numerous implementations of passwordless authentication that, while they may not always meet the strict definition of MFA, provide similar (sometimes higher) levels of security as MFA without requiring a password. Combined with context-aware adaptive security (that verifies device, network, location, time-of-day, etc.), these passwordless authentication options may provide the right level of balance between security and user experience. At this point, this isn’t scare tactics or FUD. Attacks on National infrastructure or other high-profile targets can impact the lives of millions with a single execute command. MFA is an easy layer to add to improve security and it’s commonly included with authentication solutions, so there’s really no excuse. It’s time to get it done.</p>

<p>We lost my mother, Deborah Monas, on Sunday evening. I was giving her a head rub; my sister Hannah held her hands; my dad Oscar and her brother Steve were at her&nbsp;feet.</p><p>How is this possible? The world doesn’t feel&nbsp;real.</p><p>When I was a small child, we used to pull out the sofabed in our postgraduate student flat <a href="https://medium.com/doctor-who/sofabeds-snuggling-and-the-blinovitch-limitation-effect-4a1a7dcfb196">and watch Doctor Who together under a blanket</a>. What I would give for a TARDIS now: a way to correct the fabric of time and space. Clearly something is badly wrong with&nbsp;it.</p><p>I want to have something perfect to say, some beautiful encapsulation of who she was, but the truth is that nothing could be perfect enough. There’s no way to write a biography that isn’t an imperfect model. Nothing can adequately describe my beautiful mother: her overwhelming kindness, her sense of justice, her irreverence for tradition and institutions, the love that our house was always, always filled&nbsp;with.</p><p>I’ve written a lot about her health in this space. She had dyskeratosis congenita, which first expressed itself as pulmonary fibrosis. She fought it hard. When she began to use supplementary oxygen, my sister and I moved to California to be closer. The double lung transplant she received at UCSF gave us almost an extra decade of time with her, and it was a privilege to be by her side, with my dad and my sister, on this&nbsp;journey.</p><p>She loved reading, and both Hannah and I got to share those experiences with her. Hannah read to Ma for years: books by authors like Wade Davis, Octavia Butler, and Tommy Orange. Ma and I shared book recommendations; this year we read Caste and The Nickel Boys, among others. Even as it became harder to read in print, she picked up audiobooks, and kept going, recording what she’d read in a notebook she kept by her&nbsp;bed.</p><p>Years ago, we were gifted a Sunfish sailing boat by our family friend Pammy Biscoe. The two of them had sailed on it when they were much younger. Now it became her and my thing: she was happiest out on Waquoit Bay, our striped sails catching the wind just right. She called it a Whoosh. I’ll remember her in an infinity of ways, in an infinity of moments, but being out on the water with her, watching her smile as we picked up speed, is one I’ll treasure the&nbsp;most.</p><p>When my parents met, in Berkeley in the 1970s, she worked to fight for affirmative action and tenants’ rights. Her belief and support for progressive causes was an anchor throughout her life. We discovered this week that she had quietly made over 178 progressive donations last year alone, without any of us really knowing. A list of some of the causes she consistently supported follows at the end of this post; in lieu of flowers, we’re asking people to contribute if they have the&nbsp;means.</p><p>I want to honor her by furthering what she put into the world. The loving, non-conformist, irreverent, equity-minded spirit that she embodied.</p><p>As she lay in her hospital bed, we read Ma messages from people who loved her throughout her life. One, from Hannah’s friend Anita Hurrell, particularly sums up our collective childhood, and the sensibility I want to take forward in my own life, inspired by my mother. I’ll end by sharing it here, with kind permission.</p><p>Dearest Deb,</p><p>One time you drove us in the van to the seaside and we ate sandwiches with cucumber in them and I thought they tasted delicious and I felt this strong sense of deep content sitting with Hannah in the back listening to her singing and humming for the whole journey. I have no idea where we went, and in my head it was nowhere in England, but rather part of the big-hearted, loving, funny, relaxed, non-conformist world of your family in my childhood — full of your laughter and your enormous kindness. Sitting on the bench in your house in Marston I recall a moment of feeling complete certainty that your pirozhki were the yummiest food that had ever been made. Staying in Wheatley when my mum and dad had gone away we ate popcorn and I felt safe even though at the time I had lost Blue Bear. I remember calling you my second mummy. I’m not sure I was always a very nice kid and was probably very ungrateful then, but now I wish I could convey how I revere you, Oscar, Ben and Hannah in my thoughts and how lucky I feel to keep your example with me. I look back and see how talented Hannah already was then when we were so little and she could just sing and sing and draw in a magic way, how cool she was (her doll Manuela had beautiful black wild curly hair while I chose Charlotte with twee clothes and ridiculous ringlets), what a true feminist you were, how much of parenting you seemed to do much better than we do these days, how generous and homemade and fun and kind the world you and Oscar made&nbsp;was.</p><p>You are an asset to the universe. I will always love you very&nbsp;much.</p><p>Anita</p><p>Causes Ma consistently supported:</p><p><a href="https://www.aclu.org/">ACLU</a> — <a href="https://action.aclu.org/give/now">donate</a></p><p><a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/">Planned Parenthood</a> — <a href="http://www.weareplannedparenthoodaction.org/">donate</a></p><p><a href="https://www.turnoutpac.org/">Progressive Turnout Project</a> — <a href="https://www.turnoutpac.org/donate">donate</a></p><p><a href="https://www.prochoiceamerica.org/">NARAL Pro-Choice America</a> — <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/naral-pro-choice-america-2">donate</a></p><p><a href="https://314action.org/">314 Action Fund</a> — <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/314af_website">donate</a></p><p><a href="https://www.turnoutpac.org/stop-republicans/">Stop Republicans</a> — <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/ms_srg_fr_homepage">donate</a></p><p><a href="https://traindemocrats.org/">National Democratic Training Committee</a> — <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/webdonation">donate</a></p><p><a href="https://endcitizensunited.org/">End Citizens United</a> — <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/eculavaf">donate</a></p><p><a href="https://www.kqed.org/">KQED Public Media</a> — <a href="https://donate.kqed.org/donatetoday">donate</a></p><p><a href="https://squadvictoryfund.com/">The Squad Victory Fund</a> — <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/squad-victory">donate</a></p><p><a href="https://www.boldpac.com/">BOLD Democrats PAC</a> — <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/bold-homepage">donate</a></p><p><a href="https://www.nationalbailout.org/">National Bail Out</a> — <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/freeblackmamas">donate</a></p><p><a href="https://philarballo.com/">Phil Arballo for Congress (CA-22)</a> — <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/arballo-for-congress-1">donate</a></p><p><a href="https://scottsifton.com/home/">Scott Sifton for Senate (MO)</a> — <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/blu-sift-21q1-web">donate</a></p><p>Originally published at <a href="https://werd.io/2021/ma-1">https://werd.io</a> on June 9,&nbsp;2021.</p>

Well, that rose-tinted period of conflicting optimisation is what <a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo/">&lt;/Hello, CDO!&gt; </a>is all about. Maintaining sanity when all else has been lost to untested data assumptions is a different problem entirely.</p><p>On Day zero of being a #CDO, you have to be ready and prepared as a translator, interpreter and go-between. Yes, the essential “translation” of business needs into information requires identifying the appropriate data, the relevant analysis, and the correct interpretations, but that is not what I am talking about. There is a different translation to the appropriately modelled, described and analysed, data that offers the language to enable siloed departments in organisations to talk to each other.</p><p>The CDO must have translation skills to help other executives talk about what data means to them and that each party leaves with a common understanding. Exceptional executives can ensure that key concepts from one domain or department are appropriately translated into language and concepts in the other domain.</p><p>By example,</p>  Data in the language of the finance department has to do with how to position data revenue and costs in the activities in the finance team use. Getting the budget spent on data, algorithms and analysis into the proper R&amp;D tax claim, the capitalisation table and the correct allocation for depreciation take times. How and when should data revenue be recognised? How should the margin for data be calculated? It has nothing to do with what the data does. Understanding what KPI’s the CFO is tasked with and how you can help them be achieved makes for an excellent working relationship. If The CFO is tasked with improving the balance sheet, how you capitalise spending is critical.  Data in the language of the legal department is a focus on the contractual and regulatory obligations. Understanding what the General Council is responsible for is critical, as it has nothing to do with the value data creates for the organisation. If you want certain protections for data, data use and data sharing, working with the legal team to craft holistic on and offline terms that spread across all contracts is critical.  Data in the language of the marketing team can be about privacy persevering data sharing and trust, leading to additional brand value. Sitting down with the senior leadership team in marketing to understand their KPI and BSC can help you translate data into what they need to achieve their goals. It has nothing to do with the value of the data; how they use data is a different issue. However, the CDO must be on top of conflicts that arise with sales targets driven by incentives, KPI’s opt-in demands and contractual boundaries.  <p>Being the translator, interpreter and go-between form you like a bridge, but as already articulated, it means&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo/day-0-as-the-cdo-you-are-now-the-new-corporate-punch-bag-1cddc7713c87">you are also the new corporate punchbag.</a></p>  Note to the CEO  <p>The CDO must have translation skill to help your executives speak with other disciplines about data and enable each party to leave with a common understanding. All CDOs will find the language to translate business context into data-enabled initiatives and ensure that key concepts from one domain or department are appropriately translated into language and concepts in the other domain.</p><p>We focus on the skills to “translate business needs” into data and information needs during interviews and the recruitment cycle. This additional translator, interpreter and go-between skill in this article are the built-in skills for exceptional CDO’s. However, if there is someone already in the team with this strength, it is not essential, but it does create a better working culture. Should you need these skills, they must be proven to you before you offer the job, it is not one to learn on the job.</p>

  <p>Summary:      How does a functioning credential ecosystem get started? This post looks at MemberPass, the credit union credential ecosystem and explores the strategies credit unions are using to gain broader adoption.</p>


<p>My work in self-sovereign identity began with credit unions. It was March of 2016 and I was having a conversation with Timothy Ruff and Jason Law of <a href="https://www.evernym.com/">Evernym</a> about how difficult it would be to get a multi-sided verifiable credential market going. Timothy's response was "You've got to come to Denver next week!" I showed up at a hotel ballroom in Denver to find almost 100 executives from credit unions all across the US clamoring (no, really) for verifiable credentials. I was hooked.
</p>

<p>Over five years later, with a few fits and starts, credit unions are deploying credential-based identification systems for their members. To date, seven credit unions have issued credentials to over 22,000 members or about 2% of the eligible membership of those same credit unions.
</p>

<p>Why do credit unions care? One word: fraud. Or maybe two: fraud reduction.
</p>

<a></a>
 It's All About Authentication 

<p>Credit unions and their members face the threat of fraud on all sides. And credit unions employ lots of tools to fight it. But ultimately, the problem comes down to the member and credit union authenticating each other. The problem is that doing this securely annoys people.
</p>

<p>None of us like to spend a minute–or more–answering security questions at the start of a customer service call. And <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3g8wb/hacker-got-my-texts-16-dollars-sakari-netnumber">SMS-based multi-factor authentication is becoming increasingly fraught</a>. Is that text you just got warning you about fraudulent charges on your credit card really from the credit union? It's hard to tell.
</p>

<p>Early on, a few intrepid people in the credit union industry recognized that self-sovereign identity (SSI) offered a way out of this mess. Credit unions are often small and band together to form credit union service organizations (CUSOs) that provide them the services they can't build on their own. They formed a CUSO called CULedger (later renamed <a href="https://bonifii.com/">Bonifii</a>) to make that vision a reality. Bonifii offers an SSI-based solution for credit unions called <a href="https://www.memberpass.com/">MemberPass</a>.
</p>


	<a></a>
	MemberPass Trust Triangle (click to enlarge)


<p>MemberPass allows credit unions to offer their members a verifiable credential that they can use to prove their member number to the credit union. Initially, the <a href="https://indyscan.io/tx/SOVRIN_MAINNET/domain/54177">MemberPass credential schema</a> is fairly simple, containing only the following attributes:
</p>

 
     CredentialDescription 
     CredentialId 
     MemberSince 
     MemberNumber 
     CredentialName 
     Institution 
 

<p>Of course, credentials could be much more complicated than this, but this simple schema is sufficient for a member to prove they are in possession of a credential for a specific member number. Members use the MemberPass wallet to connect to the credit union and hold the MemberPass credential.
</p>

<p>MemberPass relies on Bonifii's partner Evernym for technical services. Credit unions integrate their back office applications with the MemberPass platform at Bonifii which relies on cloud services provided by Evernym.
</p>

	MemberPass Architecture (click to enlarge)


<a></a>
 Growing Adoption 

<p>While much of the response to fraud is reactive, MemberPass is proactive. Credit unions work to get members using MemberPass as an active measure to prevent fraud. As I said earlier, to date, seven credit unions have issued credentials to over 22,000 members or about 2% of the eligible membership of those same credit unions. Julie Esser, Bonifii's SVP of Client Engagement expects the number of credit unions using MemberPass to more than double in 2021 and the number of eligible members to jump by almost an order of magnitude.
</p>

<p>Increasing the number of credit unions using MemberPass is the first segment in the adoption journey. MemberPass is already integrated with some of the back office platforms that credit unions use, easing the journey. Bonifii is also working with third party integrators to ensure they're technically ready to do the integrations for the rest.
</p>

<p>The second segment of the adoption journey is increasing the percentage of members enrolled from the current 2% to 5% and then 10% over the next year. To do that, Bonifii works with credit unions to train frontline staff in the <a href="https://www.memberpass.com/memberpass-enrollment/">enrollment process</a>. Early enrollments are happening in the branch. But enrollment can also happen on the phone. The phone enrollment process takes 3-5 minutes. The member receives the MemberPass credential while they're on the phone so the call center agent can help with any problems.
</p>

<p>First Education Credit Union's President, Jim Yates, <a href="https://www.cubroadcast.com/episodes/2306-first-education-fcu-levels-the-playing-field-launching-memberpass-digital-id-technology">says</a> that most new members are signing up. Signing up the larger body of existing members will likely require a move to self-enrollment since many never come into a branch. Self-enrollment is possible within the authenticated context of the credit union's web site. If the member chooses to enroll, they'll be directed to download the MemberPass app and then scan a QR code. This establishes a <a>secure DIDComm connection</a>. The credit union can then make the MemberPass credential offer. UNIFY Financial Credit Union allows self-enrollment now their online banking application.
</p>

<p>Once a member is enrolled, the credential can be used in-person at the branch, in the drive-thru lane (with or without interactive teller machines), on the phone, or online. This is not only more secure, but often more convenient as well. For example, someone going through the drive-thru lane can authenticate without passing plastic credentials back and forth. Logging in no longer involves receiving a text and then typing in the code. And calling into the call center no longer requires answering a series of questions of questionable value.
</p>

<p>Instead, a push notification on the member's phone asks them to verify they're the one transacting with the teller, call-center employee, or web site. The member clicks "accept" and they're done. Behind the scenes, this is a proof request made through the already established DID connection. By clicking "accept", the member is responding to the request and proving attributes from their MemberPass verifiable credential.
</p>

<p>And it's a win for the credit unions too. Desert Financial's EVP Ron Amstutz <a href="https://www.cubroadcast.com/episodes/2273-why-desert-financial-launched-digital-id-verification-tool-memberpass">says</a> it's an important step in reducing fraud. Desert Financial knows they're talking to a member and the member knows they're talking to Desert Financial. Desert Financial is initially recruiting members for the program who call into the call center frequently since that's a big pain point.
</p>

<p>Zach Eychaner from 4Front Credit Union <a href="https://www.cubroadcast.com/episodes/2295-why-4front-credit-union-launched-digital-id-solution-memberpass">says</a> the call center is the first focus for them as well. They are able to shave 30-40 seconds off of each call. With 20,000 calls a year, that time adds up.
</p>

<a></a>
 The Road Ahead 

<p>The MemberPass credential with its limited set of attributes is just a start. The future could include using MemberPass at an ATM or to open account at another credit union. Bonifii's Esser says "Once they get used to MemberPass, members will expect to use it everywhere."
</p>

<p>Here are a few things that credit unions could do to make more use of credentials and SSI:
</p>

 
     As we've seen, the current MemberPass schema is very simple–it doesn't even include the members name. A schema with more information in it–information that's been validated by the credit union–would make it usable outside the narrow use case of authenticating the member to the credit union and offer more value to members. 

     Credit unions could offer a pre-approval credential for loans that the member could hold and then use when they were ready for a loan. 

     Bonifii could issue a credential for KYC use at credit unions, banks, and in other financial transactions. 

     Shared branching is a hot topic in the credit union industry right now. Twenty-three thousand branches looks like a mega bank. But the identity fraud problems are even harder to solve across credit unions. MemberPass can help make shared branching a reality. 

     Employers and employee groups historically make up the foundation of credit unions. Credit unions could partner with employers to create a credential ecosystem. 

     The DIDComm connection is a secure messaging system. Credit unions can use this secure channel for sending notifications to members, or for customer service. 
 

<p>
    The lessons from MemberPass and the credit union industry are important for anyone launching a credential effort:
</p>

 
     Pay attention to the process and tailor it to your industry. Fraud reduction is the focus. Credit unions are evolving their enrollment process and targeting the parts of the process where they can get the most leverage. 

     Start simple. MemberPass is a simple credential but it serves an important purpose: reliably authenticating the member to reduce fraud. 

     Plan for the future, but don't get distracted. There are a thousand use cases for credentials in financial services. Get some early wins with your simple "MVVC", minimum viable verifiable credential, before you move on to the rest. 

     Stay the course. Building a credential ecosystem is more about human factors than technology. In the words of Julie Esser "The technology is baked." But that's just the start. The MemberPass ecosystem is complicated by regulation, scale, and a decentralized collection of players, each with their own problems and goals. Building an ecosystem in this environment isn't easy, but it's where the reward is. 
 

<p>
    The Covid-19 pandemic caused credit union branches to close and call center volume skyrocketed and drive-thru lanes were crowded. As a result, fraud also increased. This created a heightened awareness of the importance of digital identity across the credit union industry. But while the pandemic might have pushed things along, many in the credit union industry had already concluded that self-sovereign identity was an answer that was not only flexible, interoperable, and secure, but also one that was aligned with the values of the member-owned cooperatives that make up the credit union industry.

    I remain curious about how I can make better or wiser decisions.&nbsp; I am sharing this as part of my journey as I unpack my own boundaries and models that prevent me from making better decisions. &nbsp; <br> Context <p>I have personally, and will always, dislike and distrust “traditional” hierarchy, probably because I perceived that the “power” wielded on me would never be available to me. &nbsp; I was always on the outside; it is the joy of neuro-diversity that you become aware at an early age that to fit in the system and structure, you have to align to it, which for me, had no natural alignment.&nbsp; You either fight to fit in, fight the system or create your own.&nbsp; For many fitting in is natural, for me it never happened, and I stupidly opted for creating my own.&nbsp; I rebelled against the system and structures as I could only see hierarchy as a method of control to something I did not align to - telling me to do things that made no sense.&nbsp; Write with your right hand as a lefty.</p><p>I am not alone; from Machiavelli to Second lieutenant Boris Drubetskoy in Tolstoy's War and Peace, many have realised that there are two structures of power.&nbsp; There is an obvious hierarchy of control, reporting and subordination, and there is a second unsaid and unwritten one of lobby and access.&nbsp; The obvious one is easy to rebel.&nbsp; The lobby and access inner ring is where true power rests; it is the one to try and join. However, it is invitation-only, and many will sacrifice more than they realise in terms of ethics, morals and beliefs to be at the table and remain part of it. When thinking about data, bias and decision making, the incentive to join and incentives when in the club is a critically important driver. This unsaid shadowy hierarchy creates outcomes we did not plan for as some will jeopardise judgment and trust to be rewarded.&nbsp; I would not align to this one either, and it was self-evident that you can only become a partner in a big firm when you have a big mortgage, depending on a big salary. The significant debt and dependence on salary provide leverage.&nbsp; The humour in “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes_Minister">Yes Minister</a>”, the 1980’s BBC&nbsp; political satire sitcom, exposed much of this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Why does this matter?&nbsp; We increasingly talk to the equality and diversity (race, gender and neuro) agendas at the board and in the senior leadership team, but it is increasingly evident that there is an inner circle, which means we are not making smarter or better decisions.&nbsp; The targets for transparency and equality are just that, a target.&nbsp; (says the white over 50 male!)</p><p>I appreciate that it is difficult to separate the two dependent and co-joined aspects of the hierarchy. One aspect represents power and control, which is realised in terms of budget, size, scope, authority, and political dominance. The second is how and where important decisions sit, but those who lobby may be outside of the insights that data now provides for complex decision making.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The separate but parallel structures have worked for a long time as the consequences of long term decisions and intergenerational outcomes were not rewarded or measured. ESG, climate and the brutality of our assault on our environment, coupled with data, means this is all changing, but those who gave everything to join the inner circle have an incentive to maintain the status quo for as long as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>What ghosts are in the system that means decisions we make, with the best intentions, do not create the outcomes we desire</p><p>Take a moment to reflect.&nbsp; Are there separate hierarchies in your experience, or are they the same thing? It matters today more than ever before as we now have to make long term decisions against the backdrop of our systems of short term incentives and rewards.&nbsp; The inner ring becomes blind to a structure that always gives the feel of power as their short term decisions are highly rewarded through immediate incentives, which means being in the club is valuable for the few.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This viewpoint is looking at these two hierarchies (formal and informal) but positioning where either can be in the shadow of the other. Why am I writing this because we appear to find short term incentive-driven decisions easy but struggle to make long term judgment?&nbsp; I do not doubt the integrity of leaders who want to make better long term decisions using data and be better ancestors but get frustrated that it does not work.&nbsp; There are likely ghosts from the old decision making and lobby hierarchy in our current heuristics that create outcomes that were not planned.&nbsp;</p><p>Note: The term “Shadow Hierarchy” is used in management textbooks to describe the difference between a formal published and public structure and the one that actually has power and decision making.&nbsp; Googling “The Shadow of Hierarchy” will lead you to the 2008 paper from Adrianne Heuritier and Dirk Lehmkuhl, which was part of an EU funded project looking at “<a href="http://www.eu-newgov.org/">new models of governance</a>.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br> Our past is not easy to face up to.&nbsp; <p>There appears to be a much longer story that starts when decisions, power and control were all united.&nbsp; Over the past 5000 years, we have become increasingly short term focused and separated the decision-making process for the long term from power and control based on the science of management incentive and short term goals. There is no doubt that the structure of economics, along with other biases, come to play.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; we have created data technology on top of complex relational dependencies that means signals that should become noise through the layers of analysis, in fact, become significant distracting “interruptions” at the board. Whilst in the old system, noise and signals were hidden by the informal lobby that prevented more thoughtful long term decision making based on data, today they (signals and noise) create paralysis at all levels in structures as everyone knows everything.</p><p>Should the head of a religious movement be leading planning for the next 100 years or focussing on if the budget is spent according to the plan this quarter?&nbsp; Should our political leaders face the daily news headlines and respond or ensure we are equipped to face a global pandemic? &nbsp; Should the head of state be allowed to focus on sustainability, climate and global concerns or defending their grandchildren’s choices? What makes noise and news dominate interruptions.&nbsp; In a joined power and decision hierarchy structure a long time ago, a few individuals could make those decisions and choices, and lobby worked.&nbsp; Today our hierarchies,&nbsp; analogous to decision making,&nbsp; have become paralysed, confused and ineffective as the volume of data and signals mixed with noise has risen to a level where our ability to know what is the right thing to do is broken. Currently, we have not transitioned to something that works. Indeed lobby has also failed as it has become increasingly linked to short term reward and incentives.</p><p>The figure below captures this concept on a two-axis chart of scale and impact.&nbsp; The bottom right being an idea, it has no scale and little impact.&nbsp; The top right is big government, global businesses, global NGO’s and charities, global religion and large scale movements. &nbsp; On the journey from the idea to scale, we either transition from our ability to make long term decisions to focus on a quarter by quarter reporting justifying the delta between actual and plan *or* hold onto inter-generational consequences. Risk, funding, capital and markets have a significant impact on the loss of that long term thinking, as the rewards for the players become aligned to short term incentives. Whilst the long term hierarchies become corrupted, the shadow hierarchy of lobby gives way to a different incentive and power game.&nbsp; Impact and scale create the same problems irrespective of the organisation; short-termism can be recognised and rewarded.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Joseph, as in the Bible story and multicoloured dream coat fame aka the Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber musical. It is one of the earlier written examples of man’s capability for longer-term planning.&nbsp; It was a 14-year cycle, so not long term; however, 7 years of abundance followed by 7 of famine. Grow, harvest, store and distribute later. 4,000 years on and a 14-year strategic planning cycle looks massive but still short compared to the famed 100 years plus China and Japanese plans. I may have rose-tinted glasses that we were once better at long-range forecasting, but this is a good piece from three world-leading experts “<a href="https://theconversation.com/is-humanity-doomed-because-we-cant-plan-for-the-long-term-three-experts-discuss-137943">is humanity, in fact, unable to successfully plan for the long-term future?</a>” &nbsp; In the context of our currently limiting systems - yes.&nbsp; We have to break the system. I smell revolution.</p> Complexity of relationships <p>No doubt, a small part of the issue with our inability to long-range plan is the management of the complexity in relationships.&nbsp; The web of collaborative relationships that we need to consider only ever gets more strained, detailed, involved, dependant, and unbalanced, as each party align to their incentives and rewards.&nbsp; Critically, the unbalanced nature of the relationship means it is increasingly difficult to predict outcomes and reactions. (search:&nbsp; emergent complex systems). Our commercial framing is explored in the figure below.</p><p></p><p>The shareholder has a dependency on the board to make a decision that supports their funding of the capital. In contrast, the directors are accountable and responsible for their decisions, including unlimited liability. Everyone now has a voice that can affect choices and actions.&nbsp; The Director/ regulator/ ecosystem axis is dominated by who has the accountability and responsibilities, which are different for each stakeholder in an ecosystem and are often driving in different directions because of Balanced ScoreCards (BSC), KPI’s, incentives and being in the club.&nbsp; OKR (objective and key results) are no better, and the difference between built vs operate is a false one for the long term.&nbsp; Building the wrong thing can be rewarded very well in OKR land.&nbsp;</p><p>Continuing around the model, there is a remarkably fluid relationship between the executive teams’ and the board, where the board depends on the exec team. Still, the exec team is accountable to the board.&nbsp; (The level of fluid varies by nation and company law.) The relationships between and with the customer are particularly misunderstood, but ultimately the law says the directors are held accountable. Each of the roles in the chain of relationships from shareholders to the executive team required individuals capable of dealing with complex judgement.&nbsp; However, this assumes that the first part of this viewpoint is null.&nbsp; Let’s expand.&nbsp;</p><p>We face three connected issues but not mutually exclusive because they are a team or part of an ecosystem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>Some individuals in positions of influence and power are part of the club or want to be in the club and therefore have incentives to be in the club and stay in the club.&nbsp; Their judgement and actions are aligned with being in the club incentives.</p>  <p>Some individuals have reached influence and power but cannot grasp the new mental models and skills for complex judgment.&nbsp; Their judgement and actions are aligned with their experience.</p>  <p>Some individuals can understand the complexity and seek to explain and justify decisions and actions.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Taking this thinking and plotting this on skills/ ability vs decision environment.</p><p></p><p>The diagram above shows a decreasing number of skilled individuals who can cope with complexity. This is because the training system is about effectiveness and efficiency and not about determining if you are doing the right thing (efficacy).&nbsp; Many arrive at senior roles and find they have to shift their mindsets; some do, and some don’t, but they both now have decision capacity.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, we know that systems that create inequality, insecurity, and unsustainable practices are not easily transformed.&nbsp; Think of our government and economy. We have a system where 95% of the world live meal by meal, day by day, week by week or month by month.&nbsp; An additional 4.99% can survive for 6 to 8 months on the available cash and funds. Less than 0.01% (80 Million) of the world’s population can plan for more than a year.&nbsp; When you have those few in power and lobby, will they ever need to vote for change?&nbsp; Worth following and reading Umair Haque; I love this <a href="https://eand.co/our-societies-are-failing-because-their-economies-are-broken-72bb3d378351">essay</a> “How the Economy is Designed to Keep You Poor and Powerless.”&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://opengovernance.net/the-laws-of-1-how-far-before-you-reach-a-revolution-49bbace4049b">The laws of 1% explore outcomes if we change everything by + or - 1% and what it means to human behaviours.</a></p> What do “ghosts in the system” look like?&nbsp; <p>Imagine you are at the fairground, and there is one of the stalls where you get to throw something to win a prize.&nbsp; In the UK, we have the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coconut_shy">Coconut Shy</a>. &nbsp; You pay to get three balls or bags, stand behind the line and throw them one at a time at your coconut of choice.&nbsp; Knock a coconut off, and you win it.&nbsp; A simple game of skill (apparently).&nbsp; However, when there is a ghost in the system, it is not so simple. You line up your ball on coconut number one (it is the biggest one) and throw it with all your skill.&nbsp; As the ball approaches, the coconut moves and your ball sails past. You line up ball 2, aiming again at the largest coconut (the biggest prize); this time, you miss, but coconut number 4 wobbles.&nbsp; Your last chance on this budget.&nbsp; Lining up coconut number one for the last time, you hit it, but it does not fall off, but coconut number 6 does, the smallest one. &nbsp; The ghosts win. &nbsp; Your decisions and outcome was coconut number 1; you got number 6.&nbsp; It was not your lack of skill; coconut number 1 is glued on. Different motivations and rewards.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p> The ghosts make signals and noise.&nbsp; <p>This viewpoint started from hierarchy, and I want to return to thinking about the two hierarchies, one of decision and one of power and unpack the issues that the abundance of data has created for us.&nbsp; The diagram below sits with the idea that there is a natural order of decision making and power.&nbsp; The movement from the bottom to the peak is a move in the decision time horizon.&nbsp; Overlaid on this model is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility,_uncertainty,_complexity_and_ambiguity">VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous)</a> situations. VUCA came from preparing/ training the solder who would have to face a situation where they had to decide.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>The hierarchy is worth a paragraph to unpack, as the context of VUCA is situational.&nbsp; Front line workers are trained to be reactive. They know how to act based not on scenario but based on the situation (police, army, emergency, fire, medical, call centre, customer-facing representatives).&nbsp; How they react is one of the rules, heuristics and repeated numerous times.&nbsp; As the NIKE brand says - “just do it”, which is what you can do when you have trained to do the same thing for 10,000 hours - you don’t have to think it is a reaction.&nbsp; Above this line is the management who ensure the environment the workers have has the lowest possible risk.&nbsp; Above them is management, who think about “how do we adapt to new situations and threats?” Above them is the strategy layer, which considers “what skills do we need for the next five years, where are the gaps, and how do we access the skills.” &nbsp; For most companies, this takes us to the CEO.&nbsp; However, in public operations, there are two more layers. The transformational one is thinking about the infrastructure for the next twenty years and, finally, the policymakers.&nbsp; The policy leadership should be thinking 50 years hence and considering what policy we will need to form and how. Even at this simple layering, we can see that global leaders from presidents, prime ministers, and heads of state struggle to plan for 5 years yet are tasked with 50.&nbsp; We are not 10 x better; we have created a system 10 times worse.&nbsp;</p><p>What we should be witnessing is that one layers signal is another layers noise.&nbsp; Each layer takes all the signal from below that becomes their noise but detects new signals that they work to.&nbsp; An upward flow - not downward instruction.&nbsp; As the figure below shows, each layer has to apply different skills to find the signals needed to do their role.&nbsp; Interestingly, the lowest layers have the most operations discretion as they are exposed to the highest operational risks.&nbsp; Most diversity is welcome, but not from those who cannot do the same thing every time.&nbsp; Innovation may not be your friend in the depths.&nbsp; The strategy layer has peak decision discretion. Innovation is critical, and so is all diversity is critical. At the pinnacle is policy discretion, where is the least personal risk and whilst diversity is essential but so is adherence to a north star and single vision - so less diversity might help.&nbsp; Diversity is about situational improvement in decision making for better outcomes.&nbsp; Ouch.</p><p></p><p>However, this is not what we are witnessing right now - the above is theoretical rubbish.&nbsp; What we are feeling is summed up in the diagram below.&nbsp; There is are signals from the bottom, creating signals at the top, every layer adding more signals and noise.&nbsp; VUCA has gone from situational layers to the entire organisation, where everyone is reacting to everything.&nbsp; The ghosts of old processes and previous decisions are no longer limited to a layer, but everyone owns everything and has to react and understand. To repeat a previous line.&nbsp; Today our hierarchies,&nbsp; analogous to decision making,&nbsp; have become paralysed, confused and ineffective as the volume of data and signals mixed with noise has risen to a level where our ability to know what is the right thing to do is broken. Currently, we have not transitioned to something that works.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>The observation took time, but the question for us all is, do we believe it, and if so, what can we do?&nbsp; Do you believe it should be reflected on within the context of being in the club and how much you have already compromised on?&nbsp; Our Millenials are not in the club and will not compromise, ask them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Our stability has vanished, and our tools have broken. <p>Even to a casual observer, we live in turbulent times, which is seen through an increase in VUCA. The difficultly facing boards who carry responsibility for their decisions cannot be overstated.&nbsp; We have to deal with the ghosts of the past, the voice of the present and the spirits of the future.&nbsp; The diagram below brings out some of the tensions and conflicts being faced as we struggle to determine what we are optimising for.&nbsp; The two-axis are communication (said and unsaid) and status (know and unknown).&nbsp; The unsaid is that which is not written or spoken and assumed, often to avoid more conflict.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We have to deal with the ghosts of the past, the voice of the present and the spirits of the future.</p><p>Top right (said and known) This is the day to day operational aspects of the board and senior leadership team. There are two camps (supporter and action owner) at the board with 10 people involved in decision making. The focus is on management, KPI’s BSC and reporting.&nbsp; There are known status with data, and everyone is able and capable of engagement in the topics. We are married to this quadrant as it is easy and pays the remuneration, and we are incentivised to focus on it.&nbsp; This quadrant has traditionally depended on stability, but with VUCA disrupting that and the volume to signal and noise - we have to spend all our time here as that is all we have time for.</p><p></p><p>The bottom right is said and unknown.&nbsp; In this situation, everyone has a view about the unknown resulting in 10 camps (personal opinions and experience) with the 10 people.&nbsp; However, communication tends to be frank and honest. We go to this quadrant every now and again but quickly withdraw to safer grounds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The known and unsaid, top left.&nbsp; The unsaid here are the assumptions that we all make about everyone else in the room and their viewpoints.&nbsp; This time there is are 100 camps as we all assume about what everyone else thinks about everyone as there is no communication.&nbsp; The principal reasons not to communicate is conflict, dominance and leadership style.&nbsp; We are trapped by the debt we have (mortgage, credit, school fees, lifestyle, divorce) and need the salary; therefore, there is a degree of control.&nbsp; We try to avoid this quadrant but every now and then, we end up there because of other stress, pressures and the need for a diversion or win a political game.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The bottom left, the unknown and unsaid.&nbsp; The ecosystem has a voice, the partners of the directors have a voice, everyone has a voice, and many, due to previous flights and allegiances, are in several camps at the same time.&nbsp; The crux is that we are human and bring our differences, but it is very messy because it is unknown and unsaid. But this quadrant represents the volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity we are currently facing, and we don’t have the tools to deal with it. We have a preference based on skills, experience and incentives to focus on the top right.&nbsp;</p> Our processes and methods enable only certain decisions <p>One critical aspect of being in a leadership capacity is to question and determine how our processes and methods guide and frame certain decisions, which means we have to unpack legacy and find the ghosts in the system.</p><p>Legacy within this framing is threefold. Decisions. Decisions. Decisions. These are:</p>  <p>Previous incentives and power games created decisions that created processes, methods and rules; they are now ghosts in the systems. These decisions were taken so long ago that no one knows why, how or when it was decided. It is the way we do it; it is our IP, our brand.</p>  <p>Decisions that created “information and technology debt” included embedded and baked-in systems, hidden and no-longer supported code, and automation based on tools and data biased when created.</p>  <p>Decisions that created noise in the hierarchy to lose or filter signals that someone did not want to hear. It was the creation of layers, reports, practices, structural regulation and unchallenged assumptions.</p>  <p>Unpacking legacy questions will take time. It is worth asking questions about legacy when you are new to a company and then verifying them over time as we become blind to the tools that mould us.</p><p>I am focused on this because I want to determine how I can make smarter/ better decisions with data. For that, I need a data decision framework.&nbsp; Therefore I tend to ask what one thing do we as a leadership team want from our data?

  <p>Summary:      Interaction patterns in SSI differ from what we see in a traditional IAM system that is performing authentication and authorization. This post discussed three different authentication and authorization patterns and then shows how they are all specializations of the general verifiable credential exchange pattern.</p>

<p>
    Last year, I wrote about how <a>digital relationships are operationalized</a> in response to a <a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/vrm/2020/11/02/ssi-2/">post from Doc Searls about SSI wallets</a>. The wallet (and the agent it is paired with) is a key player in SSI workflows. A recent exchange with the good folks at <a href="https://techvisionresearch.com/">TechVision Research</a> made me realize that I hadn't ever written about the patterns that an SSI wallet uses to realize operational digital relationships. Today I'm going to take a stab at three simple authentication and authorization patterns in SSI to show the interactions necessary to accomplish these foundational workflows. Finally, I'll show how all three are just specializations of the standard verifiable credential exchange pattern.
</p>

<a></a>
 DID Authentication Pattern 

<p>
    The simplest authentication pattern uses <a>decentralized identifiers (DIDs) as autonomic identifiers</a> to establish a peer relationship. Because of their mutual authentication capabilities, DID relationships can be used for authentication.
</p>


	<a></a>
	Simple DID Authn Interaction Pattern (click to enlarge)


<p>
    This pattern has two parties:
</p>
 
     Alice has an SSI wallet on her mobile phone. 
     Bravo Corp has an enterprise wallet tied to an IAM system that is protecting some resource. 
 

<p>
    The interaction pattern has the following steps:
</p>
 
     Alice and Bravo establish a Peer DID relationship (blue arrow). This means that they each generate a Peer DID and send it to the other, along with the associated public key. These <a>identifiers are self-certifying</a> and each party can use the information associated with the DID to authenticate the other. 
     Alice tries to access the protected resource (red arrow). The request is intermediated by Bravo's IAM system. As part of this request, Alice makes her DID known. There are a number of sub-scenarios for the different ways this may happen. For example, she could scan a QR code or enter an associated human-readable identifier. 
     The IAM system, working in concert with Bravo's enterprise wallet, issues a <a href="https://ssimeetup.org/introduction-did-auth-markus-sabadello-webinar-10/">DID Auth challenge</a> to Alice's wallet through her phone. 
     Alice is notified by her wallet of the challenge and approves the response from her wallet to Bravo. 
     Bravo verifies Alice's response. 
 

<p>
    A few things to note about this interaction:
</p>
 
     Because Alice and Bravo are using Peer DIDs, no ledger is involved in the authentication. In a Peer DID relationship, both parties keep the other informed of relevant key events (e.g. key rotation) and store that information in a cryptographic key event log. 
     Any authorization would have to be done based on information the IAM system has from another source. For example, if the Peer DID relationship were established within a different authenticated context, Alice could have been assigned a group for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control">RBAC</a> or other attributes could have been associated with Alice's DID within Bravo's IAM system. 
     The interaction pattern shown here is leaves out a number of details. Markus Sabadello identifies ten different variations of this pattern in his talk <a href="https://ssimeetup.org/introduction-did-auth-markus-sabadello-webinar-10/">Introduction to DID Auth for SSI</a>. 
 

<a></a>
 Single-Party Credential Authorization Pattern 

<p>
    While the DID Authn pattern is simple, it is not as flexible as we need in some situations. For more complicated scenarios, we can use verifiable credentials. The first scenario we'll consider is where the same organization is issuing and verifying the credential.
</p>


	<a></a>
	Single-Party Credential-Based Authn Pattern (click to enlarge)


<p>
    The parties in this scenario are the same: Alice and Bravo Corp.
</p>

<p>
    The interaction pattern proceeds as follows:
</p>
 
 Since Bravo Corp will be issuing a credential, they write a Public DID and credential definition to the ledger. They might also write a schema and revocation registry, if necessary. 
 Alice and Bravo establish a Peer DID relationship (blue arrow). Note that the DID that Bravo uses for this relationship is not the public DID created in (1), instead Bravo creates a Peer DID especially for the relationship with Alice. 
 Bravo issues a credential to Alice (green arrow). The nature, content, and context of this credential issuance depend on Bravo and Alice's specific needs. Bravo is the credential issuer and Alice is the credential holder. 
 Alice tries to access a protected resource (red arrow). The request is intermediated by Bravo's IAM system. Like the DID Authn pattern, the IAM system is working in concert with an enterprise wallet. 
 Bravo is using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute-based_access_control">policy-based access control</a> (PBAC) system that relies on knowing attributes about Alice. The IAM system makes a credential request to Alice that asks for specific attributes based on the attributes needed by the policy for the resource Alice is accessing. 
 Alice sees the request and authorizes her wallet to issue a proof of attributes based on the credential she holds. The response contains only the attributes that Bravo needs, not the entire credential to minimize the information that is shared. 
 The PBAC system uses the attributes in the proof presentation to authorize Alice's access. 
 

<p>
    A few things to note:
</p>
 
 Bravo does not need to access the ledger to verify the credential since they already know the information necessary to perform the validation since it's their credential. Even so, Bravo writes the public DID and credential definition to the ledger so that Alice can present the credential to others who can verify it, supporting use cases beyond Bravo's. 
 Using a credential held by Alice to validate her authority to access the protected resource is more flexible for Bravo, and potentially more reliable, than a centralized attribute store. Rather than building a central attribute store and linking every system in the enterprise to it, each system can stand alone from the central store and make decisions based on the policies in place for that system. 
     Astute readers will read the last bullet and think "but don't they all have to be linked to the same digital wallet to take advantage of the Peer DID relationship?" The answer is "no." Each service can have its own Peer DID relationship with Alice, verify the attributes from the credential, and know it's Alice. The only thing they need to know is the public DID their organization uses and the credential definition for the credential. 
 

<a></a>
 Multi-Party Credential Authorization Pattern  

<p>
    We can extend the single-party pattern, to include multiple parties. In this pattern, one entity, Bravo Corp, is issuing credentials, but another entity, Certiphi Corp, is verifying the credential and using its attributes to authorize Alice's access to a resource.
</p>


	<a></a>
	Multi-Party Credential-Based Authn Pattern (click to enlarge)


<p>
    The interaction proceeds as follows:
</p>
 
 Since Bravo Corp is issuing a credential, they write a Public DID and credential definition to the ledger. Again, they might also write a schema and revocation registry, if needed. 
 Alice and Bravo establish a Peer DID relationship (blue arrow). 
 Bravo issues a credential to Alice (green arrow). 
 Alice and Certiphi establish a Peer DID relationship. 
 Alice tries to access the protected resource (red arrow) at Certiphi. The request is intermediated by Certiphi's IAM system. 
 Certiphi is using a policy-based access control system so, the IAM system makes a credential request to Alice that asks for the specific attributes needed by the policy for access to the resource. 
 Alice sees the request and authorizes her wallet to issue a proof of attributes based on the credentials she holds. The wallet automatically chooses the credential from Bravo since it has the attributes needed to satisfy Certiphi's request. 
 Certiphi cryptographically validates the <a>fidelity</a> of the proof to ensure it's from Bravo, is about Alice, hasn't been tampered with, and hasn't been revoked. They might also need to validate the <a>provenance of the attributes</a> in the proof. Certiphi is the credential verifier in this pattern. 
 The PBAC system uses the attributes in the proof presentation to authorize Alice's access. 
 

<p>A few things to note:
</p>
 
 The DID relationship Alice and Certiphi create in (4) could be ephemeral, it needn't be permanent unless the parties need it to be. 
 There is no direct connection or link between Bravo Corp and Certiphi Corp. They needn't have any pre-existing business or technical relationship. Certiphi needn't connect to a Bravo Corp API. 
 The primary difference between the single-party and multi-party patterns is step (8), checking the fidelity and provenance of the credential. The fidelity can be done automatically using cryptography. Determining provenance is not a trivial thing since it involves Certiphi determining they can trust attributes attested by Bravo. This is a governance issue, not a technical one. 
     The governance issue could be simple or complex. Perhaps Bravo is known to Certiphi (e.g., a local business next to a large university). Certiphi might ask Bravo to prove things about itself using credentials issued to Bravo by someone Certiphi already trusts (e.g., the government). Bravo and Certiphi might already be part of some established governance framework (e.g., a university accreditation organization). 
 

<a></a>
 Generalized Trustworthy Data Transfer Pattern 

<p>
    Authentication and authorization are table stakes for any identity interaction. The general data transfer pattern moves beyond simple authentication and authorization patterns to using identity data in workflows.
</p>


	<a></a>
	Credential-Based Data Transfer Pattern (click to enlarge)


<p>
    In this pattern, all of the interactions are identical to the pattern for multi-party authorization in the last section with a few exceptions:
</p>
 
     Alice is accessing a web service that needs data to proceed in (5) rather than a protected resource. 
     The web service uses the data from the proof presentment as part of its workflow (e.g. fill out a form). 
 

<p>
    We can view all of the previous patterns as specializations of this pattern:
</p>
 
     The Peer DID relationship provides a mutually authenticated communications channel in every case that can always be used to know that you're talking to the entity with whom the relationship was originally established–the core requirement for any authentication. 
     Transferring attributes using verifiable credentials for PBAC is just a special case of transferring attribute data in a trustworthy manner. The difference is the end-use of the attributes: the PBAC system or some other service. 
     There's no need for the data transferred in the general pattern to come from a single credential. In fact, the service can ask for attributes without knowing what credentials Alice holds. Alice's wallet will match the requested attributes to the credentials Alice holds. Alice can choose which credentials to use for specific attributes (e.g. date of birth) if she wants. 
     While the figure shows Alice accessing a web service, this can be further <a>generalized beyond the web</a>. Any data transfer for an online workflow can happen using verifiable credentials. 
     While this pattern involves Alice and two organizations, there's <a>no reason why people can't be credential issuers and verifiers</a>. Indeed, any party in these diagrams could play any of the roles. 
 

<p>
    Viewing traditional IAM functions like authentication and authorization as special purpose data transfers broadens SSI significantly beyond what we have traditionally seen as "digital identity." The <a>uses for verifiable credentials are vast</a> and include many things we may not think of as "credentials". While this expanded view of digital identity may make some uncomfortable, I think it is perfectly aligned with my belief that <a>we build identity systems to manage relationships, not identities</a>. Every relationship is unique. Flexible, trustworthy digital credentials serve that uniqueness and introduce the means of moving digital identity beyond just authentication and authorization.

<p>I used a Lisp variant in my first programming job, so I have some appreciation for the “code as data” power of that language. Nowadays I’m building an analytics system that combines Postgres and two of its procedural languages, pl/pgsql and pl/python, with a sense-making tool called <a href="https://metabase.com">Metabase</a> that’s written in a Lisp variant called <a href="https://clojure.org">Clojure</a>.</p>
<p>In Postgres I’m able to wrap SQL queries in functions; they compose with other functions that do things like cache results in materialized views and aggregate subgroups. It all feels very dynamic and functional, which are two of Clojure’s main calling cards, so this makes me wonder about Clojure as another Postgres procedural language.</p>
<p>For the pl/python functions in my system, “code as data” looks like building SQL statements that swap variables into SQL templates and combine them. This string-building approach is an anti-pattern for Clojure folk. They don’t want to work with fragments of SQL text, they want to work with Clojure maps. Here’s an example from <a href="https://github.com/musab/honeysql">Honey SQL</a>, the library that Metabase uses to build SQL texts from structured data.</p>
<p><code>(def sqlmap {:select [:a :b :c]<br>
:from   [:foo]<br>
:where  [:= :f.a "baz"]})<br>
</code></p>
<p>This seems like an important power to be able to wield in the hybrid programming environment that Postgres provides. I can imagine making very good use of it.</p>
<p>But I know very little yet about Clojure. Is this really an idea worth exploring? How else would it differ from what I’m now able to do in Python? To learn more about Clojure I’ve been watching talks by its creator, Rich Hickey. Most are tech-heavy but one of them isn’t like the others. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc">Hammock-driven development</a> he lays out a process for creative problem solving that coordinates the waking mind (at the computer doing critical thinking and analysis) with the background mind (on the hammock doing abstraction, analogy, and synthesis). The coordination is explicit: You use the waking mind to feed work to the background mind which is “the solver of most non-trivial problems”; you weight your inputs to the background mind in order to influence their priority in its thinking.</p>
<p>I guess I’ve done that kind of thing implicitly from time to time, but never in such an intentional way. So, is Clojure-in-Postgres worth exploring? Perhaps by writing this I’ll prime my background mind and will receive more clarity in the morning.</p>

   <p><a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/">Peak Paradox</a> is a framework to help you reclaim clarity and control as we believe that if you cannot see the paradox, you have been framed and are in a model where someone else is in control.&nbsp; When you can see the paradox in the data, information, recommendation or decision, you will have improved your clarity.&nbsp; This is a guide <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/explaining-the-model">on how to apply the framework to unlock business models, concepts and complexity</a>.</p><p>Most aspects of everyday business and life can be questioned within the boundaries of the Peak Paradox Framework.&nbsp; I have been exploring that we tend to go out of bounds for a while but find it is too hard to stay there for long. Movement outside of the boundary tends to be a transitional state.&nbsp; The thick red line illustrates the usual boundaries in the figure below.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/post/plotting-how-to-make-better-decisions">This post explored how to make better decisions using the framework</a> and laid down the idea that some decisions can occur off-piste, outside of the normal boundaries. It presented the reason why we need to minimise shared decision making, find followers and create shared passion if we want to make a difference.&nbsp; Indeed it is no longer about enemies in the camp but about identifying those who share the belief. We must have diversity and not about diversification away from the shared belief.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>I explored the concept that we are <a href="https://opengovernance.net/what-occurs-when-physical-beings-transition-to-information-beings-146ea9dcbca3">transitioning from Physical beings to Information beings</a>.&nbsp; The article proposed that our existing models for oversight and governance are breaking and that we need to think about addressing this emerging gap.&nbsp; In an earlier post, I explained that many <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/post/hello-world">models take us to the boundaries</a> in the Peak Paradox framework, such as cults, politics, beliefs and religion.&nbsp; This post presents the thinking that the economic model of monopoly and political activity of war are outside the framework and a transitional state.&nbsp;</p> As physical beings&nbsp; <p>In the figure below, war and monopoly are outside the boundary between Peak Individual Purpose and Peak Work Purpose.&nbsp; War is nasty, inhumane, and complex, but it serves as a tool to acquire more land with a historical lens. Control of land gave you access to resources, people and materials.&nbsp; The more land and more resources you had access to, in straightforward terms, enabled a few to realise their Peak Individual Purpose (become more sovereign) and for others to realise Peak Work Purpose through growth.&nbsp;</p><p>A more modern version of war is the economics of monopoly, duopoly, or cartel, where a few seek to control resources for their personal gain, enabling them to achieve Peak Individual Purpose through their companies having control.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Both war and monopoly have become increasingly regulated over time. We have created, as humans, complex rules of engagement, governance and oversight.&nbsp; In part to ensure control and power does not fall to one person in a democracy, to protect the vulnerable and to respect life.&nbsp; If they work or not is another story.&nbsp;</p><p></p> As information beings <p>It is not that physical has or will vanish; we will co-exist as both physical and informational. Our physical being is still very much here, but we live in an emergent digital/ data augmented world.&nbsp; War has become cyberwarfare and monopoly of land, and people have become the monopoly of data that indirectly controls people and land, often through an instrument such as debt.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>The question being asked is, “have we changed more than just the nature of war and monopoly as we expand from physical beings to information beings?”&nbsp; Our rules, methods, insights and policy work for us as physical beings, but do the same systems and structures work in an information age.&nbsp; Is the paradox that we have to deal with the same outcomes from war and monopolies (control and power), but there is a shift.&nbsp; What is this shift? &nbsp; Yes, some cybercrime and cyber warfare is a replication of the historical war framing, insomuch that an individual, cause or nation wants to use data/ digital as a method of control.&nbsp; But this is just the natural advancement of physical beings adapting to new technology. Gunpowder is another example.&nbsp; However, information being cyberwar is a fight or rage against the machine trying to bring about a better life for everyone and expose injustice - this is different. Past freedom fighters against oppression look similar.&nbsp; A monopoly of data is different to a monopoly of physical resources because <a href="https://opengovernance.net/data-is-data-90ba0b803178">data is data</a>.&nbsp; Data is, by its nature, non-rivalrous and non-excludable. This simple fact is that you cannot declare ownership of data (though many people try); you cannot control it; you lose nothing when you copy it. It is why data is data. &nbsp; Data can bring about better health care; data can bring about better education; data can bring transparency, and data can bring equality.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://opengovernance.net/what-occurs-when-physical-beings-transition-to-information-beings-146ea9dcbca3">An AI can make better decisions,</a> if we knew what this is, without the bias of human politics. However, it is far too easy to keep our physical being lens on everything as we like it, we are used to it, our systems are aligned to it, and we can ignore or rubbish the emergence and augmentation of data in our decision methodology.&nbsp; A critical point beginning that what we had as oversight and controls for war and monopoly worked for physical beings. The same systems break as informational beings because there is a shift in purpose and even outcomes. What is hard to comprehend is that this is not a transition; it is the emergence of information beings and that both will co-exist. We need to keep adapting our physical rules but need new thinking for informational beings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>What does the Peak Paradox framework highlight about this situation? There is an assumption that we are aligned (what type of being are we or both) and how we understand if there is alignment in the team.&nbsp; Because this is hard and subtle, we prefer to assume and make jumps because curiosity and questioning expose ghosts in our thinking and the system;&nbsp; like conflict, tension and power. We don't like facing up to these as they are hard and reflective. The Peak Paradox framework will surface the ghosts and determine if there is an alignment or a delta in the team, project, mission or purpose.&nbsp; If we are only physical beings in our views, we will ignore digital and data and the coming information being. &nbsp; If we are information beings, we see that the controls don’t work, and we are free to exploit an emergent space.&nbsp; The current data monopoly holders don’t look like monopolies through the lens of physical beings.</p><p>The current data monopoly holders don’t look like monopolies through the lens of physical beings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>War and monopoly exist in both the physical and data/ digital/ information world. Still, we cannot apply the same system of the physical world controls developed over generations to the digital/ data/ information world - it is not they break it is they don’t work. &nbsp; The system of control fails because the purpose for which war and monopoly exist is the same and has created a new space.&nbsp; We use the exact same words, but the meaning has changed.&nbsp; Why is monopoly different in a data/ digital information world? Because it looks competitive, data is movable, and users have a choice.&nbsp; Why is war in a data/ digital information world different - because the outcome is not about control.&nbsp; However, the physical still exists, which can confuse and create paradoxes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p> <br>

<p>On the top left is a photo taken with my trusty old (also much used and abused) <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/canon-eos-5d-mark-iii">Canon 5D Mark III</a>. On the top right is one taken by a borrowed new <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/products/sony/slrs/sony_a7riii">Sony a7Riii</a>. Below both are cropped close-ups of detail. The scene is in a room illuminated by incandescent track lighting. It is not an art shot, though it does contain photo art by our good friend <a href="https://mariancrostic.com/">Marian Crostic</a>, whose&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/sony-alpha-a7r">Sony a7R</a>&nbsp;she is kindly remanding to my custody tomorrow. (Her main camera is now an a7Riii like the borrowed one I used here.)</p>
<p>Both photos were shot with Canon and Sony’s best 24-105 f4 zoom lenses, at the 105mm end. Both were also set to automatic, meaning the camera chooses all the settings. In both cases the camera chose ISO 3200 at f4. The only difference was shutter speed: 1/125 sec on the Canon and 1/160 sec on the Sony. While 3200 is not the prettiest ISO, I wanted to compare both cameras indoors under less than ideal lighting, because that’s typical of situations where I shoot a lot of people.</p>
<p>One difference between these cameras is the pixel density of the sensor: the Canon’s shot is 5760 x 3840 pixels, while the Sony’s is 7952 x 5304. While that difference accounts for some of the higher detail in the Sony’s shot, it’s clear to me that the Sony lens is simply sharper, as <a href="https://www.kenrockwell.com/">Ken Rockwell</a>&nbsp;kinda promised in <a href="https://www.kenrockwell.com/sony/lenses/24-105mm-f4.htm">this glowing review</a>. (Also, to be fair, the Canon lens has had a&nbsp;lot of use.)</p>
<p>All the images above are screen shots of RAW versions of the photos (.CR2 for the Canon and .ARW for the Sony). Though I don’t have the time or patience to show differences in the .JPG versions of these photos, it’s clear to me that the Canon’s JPGs look less artifacted by compression. The obvious artifacts in the Sony shots have me thinking I may only shoot RAW with the a7R, though I’ll need to test it out first.</p>
<p>The main difference overall, at least in this setting, is in the warmth of the color. There the Canon has a huge advantage. I could say it’s also because the Sony is slightly less exposed (by the higher shutter speed); but I noticed the same difference in test shots I took outdoors as well, under both overcast and sunlit skies, and at ISO 100. The Canon seems warmer, though the Sony has far more detail one can pull out of shadows.</p>
<p>I should add that neither camera got the color of the wall (a creamy white) right in these photos, with the Canon leaning hot and the Sony leaning cool.</p>
<p>Anyway, I just thought I’d share that much before I pick up the a7R, and start using it to shoot stuff in New York, where I’m headed Wednesday night after more than a year away.</p>

<p>This article shows how Zero Knowledge Proofs ZKP verifiable credentials can be used to verify a persons vaccination data implemented in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/introduction-to-aspnet-core">ASP.NET Core</a> and <a href="https://mattr.global/">MATTR</a>. The ZKP BBS+ verifiable credentials are issued and stored on a digital wallet using a Self-Issued Identity Provider (SIOP) and Open ID Connect. The data can then be used to verify if the holder has the required credentials, but only the required data is used and returned to the verification application. The holder of the data who owns the wallet can consent or not consent to allow the verification application to see and use the vaccination data. <a href="https://auth0.com/">Auth0</a> is used to implement the identity provider.</p>

<p>What are Zero Knowledge Proof enabled credentials </p>



<p>Zero Knowledge Proof enabled credentials allows you to selectively disclose claims from a verifiable credential without disclosing all of the information of the verifiable credential. It also makes it possible to verify data without having to share the sensitive data required to verify something. In this post, we will just selectively request part of the data from a verifiable credential. This would make it possible to implement business flows without having to share or copy the sensitive data.</p>



<p>Setup ZKP Vaccination Data Issue and Verify</p>



<p>The demo application implements a covid vaccination data process. A number of components, applications are required to implement these flows. The idea is that when a person is vaccinated, the authority responsible for this could add the vaccination data to the persons identity. In this demo, that would be added to the Auth0 service which can be accessed in the id_token claims. The vaccination data organization can use the credentials issuer application to create a DID credential issuer using ZKP verifiable credentials. The end user can use a digital wallet to add his or his credentials using the SIOP flow which gets the claims from the IDP and adds the data to the digital wallet.  The verification application would have to create a presentation template defining the claims which are required to use to verify. Once created, a new verification request can be created and used to verify the vaccination data from the user. The user would scan the presented QR Code from the verifier application and display a verify in the digital wallet. Once consented, the data is returned to the verifier application using an API. The data can be processed and the UI is updated with a verified result or not. The blockchain ledger is abstracted away and used indirectly through MATTR which has APIs for the Self sovereign identity specifications. </p>







<p>Issuing Zero Knowledge Proof enabled credentials</p>



<p>The VaccineCredentialsIssuer ASP.NET Core application is used to create the credential issuer and present this as a QR Code for the user to add vaccination Zero Knowledge Proofs verifiable credentials. The flow implemented is very similar to the flow used in the previous blog <a href="https://damienbod.com/2021/05/03/create-an-oidc-credential-issuer-with-mattr-and-asp-net-core/">Create an OIDC credential Issuer with MATTR and ASP.NET Core</a> . A DID is created to use a BLS key type which supports BBS+ signatures for issuing ZKP-enabled credentials. </p>


  public class MattrOptions
{
	/// &lt;summary&gt;
	/// The supported key types for the DIDs are ed25519 and bls12381g2. 
	/// If the keyType is omitted, the default key type that will be used is ed25519.
	/// 
	/// If the keyType in options is set to bls12381g2 a DID will be created with 
	/// a BLS key type which supports BBS+ signatures for issuing ZKP-enabled credentials.
	/// &lt;/summary&gt;
	public string keyType { get; set; } = "bls12381g2";
}
  


<p>The DID is used to create a credential issuer for the ZKP credentials. The CreateMattrCredentialIssuer method takes the DID created with the bls12381g2 key and creates the OIDC credential issuer.</p>


  private async Task&lt;V1_CreateOidcIssuerResponse&gt; CreateMattrCredentialIssuer(HttpClient client, V1_CreateDidResponse did)
{
	// create vc, post to credentials api
	// https://learn.mattr.global/tutorials/issue/oidc-bridge/setup-issuer

	};

					await createOidcIssuerResponse.Content.ReadAsStringAsync());

			return v1CreateOidcIssuerResponse;
		}

		var error = await createOidcIssuerResponse.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
	}

	throw new Exception("whoops something went wrong");
}
  


<p>The data from the MATTR response is used to create the callback for the credentials issuer. This is persisted to a database as this needs to be created only once and can be re-used.</p>


   public async Task&lt;string&gt; CreateCredentialsAndCallback(string name)
        {
            // create a new one
            var vaccinationDataCredentials = await CreateMattrDidAndCredentialIssuer();
            vaccinationDataCredentials.Name = name;
            await _vaccineCredentialsIssuerCredentialsService.CreateVaccinationData(vaccinationDataCredentials);

            var callback = $"https://{_mattrConfiguration.TenantSubdomain}/ext/oidc/v1/issuers/{vaccinationDataCredentials.OidcIssuerId}/federated/callback";
            return callback;
        }
  


<p>The data is displayed as a QR Code in a ASP.NET Core Razor page application. This can be scanned and the credentials will be added to your digital wallet, if the Open ID Connect server has the claims for the identity required by this issuer.</p>







<p>Auth0 is used to add the identity data for the claims. An Auth0 pipeline rule was created and used to add these claims to the id_tokens.</p>


  function (user, context, callback) {
    const namespace = 'https://damianbod-sandbox.vii.mattr.global/';

    context.idToken[namespace + 'date_of_birth'] = user.user_metadata.date_of_birth;
  
    context.idToken[namespace + 'family_name'] = user.user_metadata.family_name;
    context.idToken[namespace + 'given_name'] = user.user_metadata.given_name;
    context.idToken[namespace + 'medicinal_product_code'] = user.user_metadata.medicinal_product_code;
    context.idToken[namespace + 'number_of_doses'] = user.user_metadata.number_of_doses;
    context.idToken[namespace + 'total_number_of_doses'] = user.user_metadata.total_number_of_doses;
    context.idToken[namespace + 'vaccination_date'] = user.user_metadata.vaccination_date;
    context.idToken[namespace + 'country_of_vaccination'] = user.user_metadata.country_of_vaccination;
  
    callback(null, user, context);
}
  


<p>The data needs to be added to each user in Auth0. If using this in a real application, a UI could be created and used to add the specific data for each user. The credential issuer is tightly coupled through the data with the IDP. So each credential issuer which creates verifiable credentials would require it’s own identity provider and full access to update the profiles. The IDP contains the business data required to issuer the credentials. Auth0 might not be a good choice for this, maybe something like IdentityServer or Openiddict would be a better choice because you could implement custom UIs with ASP.NET Core Identity and the complete UIs for the credential issuing flows.</p>



<p>When the credential issuer is scanned by the digital wallet, the user logs into the OIDC server and gets the data for the ZKP verifiable credentials. In a MATTR wallet, this is displayed with the Privacy enhancing credential information.</p>







<p>Verifying the credentials</p>



<p>Before the ZKP credentials can be verified, a presentation template is created to define the required credentials to verify. The DID ID from the credential issuer is used to find the DID in the ledger. The CreateMattrPresentationTemplate method creates the template using the QueryByFrame so that the exact claims can be defined. The context must use the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ldp-bbs2020/context/v1">https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ldp-bbs2020/context/v1</a> namespace to use the ZKP BBS+ credentials in MATTR. The type must be VerifiableCredential.</p>


  private async Task&lt;V1_PresentationTemplateResponse&gt; CreateMattrPresentationTemplate(
	HttpClient client, string didId)
{
	// create presentation, post to presentations templates api
	// https://learn.mattr.global/tutorials/verify/presentation-request-template
	// https://learn.mattr.global/tutorials/verify/presentation-request-template#create-a-privacy-preserving-presentation-request-template-for-zkp-enabled-credentials

	var createPresentationsTemplatesUrl = $"https://{_mattrConfiguration.TenantSubdomain}/v1/presentations/templates";

	var additionalPropertiesCredentialSubject = new Dictionary&lt;string, object&gt;();
	additionalPropertiesCredentialSubject.Add("credentialSubject", new VaccanationDataCredentialSubject
	{

	});

	var additionalPropertiesCredentialQuery = new Dictionary&lt;string, object&gt;();

<p>Verifying is very similar to the blog <a href="https://damienbod.com/2021/05/10/present-and-verify-verifiable-credentials-in-asp-net-core-using-decentralized-identities-and-mattr/">Present and Verify Verifiable Credentials in ASP.NET Core using Decentralized Identities and MATTR</a>. A new DID of type ed25519 is used to invoke a verify request and also sign the request. The verifying flow in the application presents a QR Code using the redirectURL technic because the signed request is too long to present as a QR Code. This request returns a 302 with the full jws. </p>







<p>The application needs to be started using a public domain because the digital wallet will request back to the API with the data. I use ngrok to test locally. The verifier application can be started and the verify process is started by clicking the verify button which displays the QR Code to verify. </p>



<p>Start the application and start ngrok </p>


  ngrok http http://localhost:5000
  


<p>The QR Code can be scanned to verify.</p>







<p>In the digital wallet, the verification request for the vaccination data can be viewed and if ok sent. The digital wallet displays the data which is disclosed and the data which is not. When the user clicks send, the data is validated and the API from the verifier application is called.</p>







<p>When the Verify application receives the callback from the digital wallet, the data is validated and the challenge ID is used to notify the user of a successful verification. The data is saved to a database and ASP.NET Core SignalR is used to update the UI. When the message from SignalR is sent, the user is redirected to the success page using the challenge ID and the data is displayed with the success image.</p>







<p>Notes</p>



<p>Now we have a full create, holder, verify process implemented for Zero Knowledge Proof verifiable credentials using covid vaccination data. OIDC is used to authenticate and create the claims used for the credentials. The OIDC connect server or identity provider is tightly coupled to the credential issuer because business uses the data from the id_token. When using SIOP, I would use ASP.NET Core Identity and either OpenIddict of Identityserver4 to implement this as part of the credential issuer. You need full control of the claims so using Auth0, Azure AD or Azure B2C would probably be a bad choice here. You could federate then to one of these from the credential issuer to use the profiles as required. Each vaccinated user would also require a user account. ZKP verifiable credentials makes it possible to support user privacy better and mix claims easier from different credentials. Another problem with this solution is the vendor lockdown. This is a problem with any self sovereign solution at the moment. Even though, the specifications are all standard, unless you want to implement this completely yourself, you would choose a vendor specific implementation which locks you down to a specific wallet or with specific features only. Interop does not seem to work at the moment. This is a problem with all security solutions at present not just SSI, all software producers, security services use security reasoning as an excuse to try to force you into lockdown into their specific product. You can see this with most of the existing OIDC solutions and services. Typical quotes for this are “You can use any OIDC client, but we recommend our OIDC client…” SSI will open possibilities for new security solutions and it will be very interesting to see how application security develops in the next five years. </p>

<p>My post yesterday saw action on <a href="https://techmeme.com/">Techmeme</a> (as I write this, it’s at #2) and on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/dmarti/status/1398765786714361859">from Don Marti</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/acfou/status/1399029656444092419">Augustine Fou</a>, et. al.), and in thoughtful blog posts by John Gruber <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/05/30/searls-apple-att">in Daring Fireball</a> and <a href="https://pxlnv.com/linklog/">Nick Heer</a> <a href="https://pxlnv.com/linklog/searls-apple-privacy/">in Pixel Envy</a>. All pushed back on at least some of what I said. Here are some excerpts, with my responses. First, John:</p>
<blockquote><p>Doc Searls:</p>
<blockquote><p>Here’s what’s misleading about this message:&nbsp;Felix would have had none of those trackers following him if he had gone into Settings → Privacy → Tracking, and pushed the switch to off&nbsp;[…].</p>
<p>Key fact:&nbsp;it is defaulted to on. Meaning Apple is not fully serious about privacy. If Apple was fully serious, your iPhone would be set to not allow tracking in the first place. All those trackers would come pre-vaporized.</p></blockquote>
<p>For all the criticism Apple has faced from the ad tech industry over this feature, it’s fun to see criticism that Apple isn’t going far enough. But I don’t think Searls’s critique here is fair. Permission to allow tracking is&nbsp;not&nbsp;on by default — what is on by default is permission for the app to&nbsp;ask. Searls makes that clear, I know, but it feels like he’s arguing as though apps can track you by default, and they can’t.</p>
<p>But I don’t think Searls’s critique here is fair. Permission to allow tracking is not on by default — what is on by default is permission for the app to ask. Searls makes that clear, I know, but it feels like he’s arguing as though apps can track you by default, and they can’t.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m not arguing that. But let’s dig down a bit on all this.</p>
<p>What Apple has here is a system for asking in both directions (apps asking to track, and users asking apps not to track). I think this is weird and unclear, while simply disallowing tracking globally would be clear. So would a setting that simply turns off all apps’ ability to track. But that’s not what we have.</p>
<p>Or maybe we do.</p>
<p>To review… in&nbsp;Settings—&gt;Privacy—&gt;Tracking, is a single OFF/ON switch for “Allow Ads to Request to Track.” It is by default set to ON. (I called AppleCare to be sure about this. The guy I spoke to said yes, it is.) Below that setting is a bit of explanatory text with a “Learn more” link that goes to this long column of text one swipes down four times (at least on my phone) to read:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Okay, now look in the fifth paragraph (three up from where you’re reading now). There it says that by turning the setting to OFF, “all apps…will be blocked from accessing the device’s Advertising Identifier.” Maybe I’m reading this wrong, but it seems plain to me that this will at least pre-vaporize trackers vectored on the device identifier (technically called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identifier_for_Advertisers">IDFA: ID For Advertisers</a>).</p>
<p>After explaining why he thinks the default setting to ON is the better choice, and why he likes it that way (e.g. he can see what apps want to track, surprisingly few do, and he knows which they are), John says this about the IDFA:</p>
<blockquote><p>IDFA was well-intentioned, but I think in hindsight Apple realizes it was naive to think the surveillance ad industry could be trusted with anything.</p>
<blockquote><p>And why “ask” an app not to track? Why not “tell”? Or, better yet, “Prevent Tracking By This App”? Does&nbsp;asking&nbsp;an app not to track mean it&nbsp;won’t?</p></blockquote>
<p>This is Apple being honest. Apple can block apps from accessing the IDFA identifier, but there’s nothing Apple can do to&nbsp;guarantee&nbsp;that apps won’t come up with their own device fingerprinting schemes to track users behind their backs. Using “Don’t Allow Tracking” or some such label instead of “Ask App Not to Track” would create the false impression that Apple can block any and all forms of tracking. It’s like a restaurant with a no smoking policy. That doesn’t mean you won’t go into the restroom and find a patron sneaking a smoke. I think if Apple catches applications circumventing “Ask App Not to Track” with custom schemes, they’ll take punitive action, just like a restaurant might ask a patron to leave if they catch them smoking in the restroom — but they can’t guarantee it won’t happen. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G05nEgsXgoI">Joanna Stern asked Craig Federighi about this in their interview a few weeks ago</a>, and Federighi answered honestly.)</p>
<p>If Apple could give you a button that&nbsp;guaranteed&nbsp;an app couldn’t track you, they would, and they’d label it appropriately. But they can’t so they don’t, and they won’t exaggerate what they&nbsp;can&nbsp;do.</p></blockquote>
<p>On Twitter Don Marti <a href="https://twitter.com/dmarti/status/1398765786714361859">writes</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>Unfortunately it probably has to be “ask app not to track” because some apps will figure out ways around the policy (like all mobile app store policies). Probably better not to give people a false sense of security if they are suspicious of an app</p></blockquote>
<p>—and then points to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/p-g-worked-with-china-trade-group-on-tech-to-sidestep-apple-privacy-rules-11617902840">P&amp;G Worked With China Trade Group on Tech to Sidestep Apple Privacy Rules</a>, subtitled “One of world’s largest ad buyers spent years building marketing machine reliant on digital user data, putting it at odds with iPhone maker’s privacy moves” in The Wall Street Journal. In it is this:</p>
<blockquote><p>P&amp;G marketing chief Marc Pritchard has advocated for a universal way to track users across platforms, including those run by Facebook and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, that protects privacy while also giving marketers information to better hone their messages.</p>
<p>Frustrated with what it saw as tech companies’ lack of transparency, P&amp;G began building its own consumer database several years ago, seeking to generate detailed intelligence on consumer behavior without relying on data gathered by Facebook, Google and other platforms. The information is a combination of anonymous consumer IDs culled from devices and personal information that customers share willingly. The company said in 2019 that it had amassed 1.5 billion consumer identifications world-wide.</p>
<p>China, where Facebook and Google have a limited presence, is P&amp;G’s most sophisticated market for using that database. The company funnels 80% of its digital-ad buying there through “programmatic ads” that let it target people with the highest propensity to buy without presenting them with irrelevant or excessive ads, P&amp;G Chief Executive Officer David Taylor said at a conference last year.</p>
<p>“We are reinventing brand building, from wasteful mass marketing to mass one-to-one brand building fueled by data and technology,” he said. “This is driving growth while delivering savings and efficiencies.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In response to that, I <a href="https://twitter.com/dsearls/status/1399028948063834112">tweeted</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>Won’t app makers find ways to work around the no tracking ask, regardless of whether it’s a global or a one-at-a-time setting? That seems to be what the<br>
@WSJ is saying about&nbsp; @ProcterGamble ‘s work with #<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAID_(technology)">CAID</a> device fingerprinting.</p></blockquote>
<p>Don <a href="https://twitter.com/dmarti/status/1399054402938236930">replied</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>Yes. Some app developers will figure out a way to track you that doesn’t get caught by the App Store review. Apple can’t promise a complete “stop this app from tracking me” feature because sometimes it will be one of those apps that’s breaking the rules</p></blockquote>
<p>Then Augustine Fou <a href="https://twitter.com/acfou/status/1399029656444092419">replied</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>of course, MANY ad tech companies have been working on fingerprinting for years, as a work around to browsers (like Firefox) allowing users to delete cookies many years ago. Fingerprinting is even more pernicious because it is on server-side and out of control of user entirely</p></blockquote>
<p>That last point is why I’ve long argued that we have a very basic problem with the client server model itself: that it all but guarantees a feudal system in which clients are serfs and site operators (and Big Tech in general) are their lords and masters. Though my original metaphor for client-server (which I have been told was originally a euphemism for slave-master) was calf-cow:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here’s more on that one,&nbsp;plus some other metaphors as well:</p>

 <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/vrm/2012/02/21/stop-making-cows-stop-being-calves/">Stop making cows. Quit being calves</a> (from 2012) 
 <a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/vrm/2021/03/08/leverage/">Is being less tasty vegetables our best strategy?</a>&nbsp;(2021)

 <a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/vrm/2021/03/08/leverage/">Toward e-commerce 2.0</a> (2021) 
 <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2021/05/14/poison/">How the cookie poisoned the Web</a> (2021) 
 
<p>I’ll pick up that thread after visiting <a href="https://pxlnv.com/linklog/searls-apple-privacy/">what Nick says</a> about fingerprinting:</p>
<blockquote><p>There are countless ways that devices can be fingerprinted, and the mandated use of IDFA instead of those surreptitious methods makes it harder for ad tech companies to be sneaky. It has long been possible to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.imore.com/how-limit-ad-tracking-iphone-and-ipad">turn off IDFA</a>&nbsp;or reset the identifier. If it did not exist, ad tech companies would find other ways of individual tracking without users’ knowledge, consent, or control.</p>
<blockquote><p>And why “ask” an app not to track? Why not “tell”? Or, better yet, “Prevent Tracking By This App”? Does asking an app not to track mean it&nbsp;won’t?</p>
<p>History has an answer for those questions.</p>
<p>Remember&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track">Do Not Track</a>? Invented in the dawn of tracking, back in the late ’00s, it’s still a setting in every one of our browsers. But it too is just an ask — and ignored by nearly every website on Earth.</p></blockquote>
<p>Much like Do Not Track, App Tracking Transparency is a request — verified as much as Apple can by App Review — to&nbsp;<a href="https://pxlnv.com/linklog/tracking-transparency-federighi/">avoid false certainty</a>. Tracking is a pernicious reality of every internet-connected technology. It is ludicrous to think that any company could singlehandedly find and disable all forms of fingerprinting in all apps, or to guarantee that users will not be tracked.</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree. This too is a problem with the feudal system that the Web + app world has become, and Nick is right to point it out. He continues,</p>
<blockquote><p>The thing that bugs me is that Searls knows all of this. He’s&nbsp;Doc Searls; he has an extraordinary&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/the-adblock-war/">thirteen year history</a>&nbsp;of writing about this stuff. So I am not entirely sure why he is making arguments like the ones above that, with knowledge of his understanding of this space, begin to feel disingenuous. I have been thinking about this since I read this article last night and I have not come to a satisfactory realistic conclusion.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here’s a realistic conclusion (or at least the one that’s in my head right now): I was mistaken to assume that Apple has more control here than it really does, and it’s right for all these guys (Nick, John, Augustine, Don and others) to point that out. Hey, I gave in to wishful thinking and unconscious ad hominem argumentation. Mea bozo. I sit corrected.</p>
<p>He continues,</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple is a big, giant, powerful company — but it is only one company that operates within the realities of legal and technical domains. We cannot engineer our way out of the anti-privacy ad tech mess. The only solution is regulatory. That will not guarantee that bad actors do not exist, but it could create penalties for, say, Google when it&nbsp;<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/unredacted-google-lawsuit-docs-detail-efforts-to-collect-user-location-2021-5">ignores users’ choices</a>&nbsp;or Dr.&nbsp;B when it&nbsp;<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/05/24/1025281/covid-vaccine-waitlist-dr-b-collected-data-from-millions/">warehouses medical data</a>&nbsp;for unspecified future purposes.</p></blockquote>
<p>We’ve had the GDPR and the CCPA in enforceable forms for awhile now, and the main result, for us mere “data subjects” (GDPR) and “consumers” (CCPA) is a far worse collection of experiences in using the Web.</p>
<p>At this point my faith in regulation (which I celebrated, at least in the GDPR case, when it went into force) is less than zero. So is my faith in tech, within the existing system.</p>
<p>So I’m moving on, and working on a new approach, outside the whole feudal system, which I describe in <a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/vrm/2021/05/05/a-new-way/">A New Way</a>. It’s truly new and small, but I think it can be huge: much bigger than the existing system, simply because we on the demand side will have better ways of informing supply (are you listening, Mark Pritchard?) than even the best surveillance systems can guess at.</p>

<p>This piece has had a lot of very smart push-back (and forward, but mostly back). I respond to it in <a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2021/05/30/apple-vs-or-plus-adtech-part-ii/">Part II, here</a>.</p>
<p>If you haven’t seen it yet, watch Apple’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w4qPUSG17Y">Privacy on iPhone | tracked ad</a>. In it a guy named Felix (that’s him, above) goes from a coffee shop to a waiting room somewhere, accumulating a vast herd of hangers-on along the way. The herd represents trackers in his phone, all crowding his personal space while gathering private information about him. The <a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/mind-your-own-business-delta-5-apple-ad-privacy-1234979172/#!">sound track</a> is “Mind Your Own Business,” by Delta 5. <a href="https://genius.com/Delta-5-mind-your-own-business-lyrics">Lyrics</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Can I have a taste of your ice cream?<br>
Can I lick the crumbs from your table?<br>
Can I interfere in your crisis?</p>
<p>No, mind your own business<br>
No, mind your own business</p>
<p>Can you hear those people behind me?<br>
Looking at your feelings inside me<br>
Listen to the distance between us</p>
<p>Why don’t you mind your own business?<br>
Why don’t you mind your own business?</p>
<p>Can you hear those people behind me?<br>
Looking at your feelings inside me<br>
Listen to the distance between us</p>
<p>Why don’t you mind your own business?<br>
Why don’t you mind your own business?</p></blockquote>
<p>The ad says this when Felix checks his phone from the crowded room filled with people spying on his life:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then this:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Finally, when he presses “Ask App Not to Track,” all the hangers-on go pop and turn to dust—</p>
<p></p>
<p>Followed by</p>
<p></p>
<p>Except that she gets popped too:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Meaning he doesn’t want any one of those trackers in his life.</p>
<p>The final image is the one at the top.</p>
<p>Here’s what’s misleading about this message: Felix would have had none of those trackers following him if he had gone into Settings—&gt;Privacy—&gt;Tracking, and pushed the switch to off, like I’ve done here:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Key fact:&nbsp;it is defaulted to on. Meaning Apple is not fully serious about privacy. If Apple was fully serious, your iPhone would be set to not allow tracking in the first place. All those trackers would come pre-vaporized. And Apple never would have given every iPhone an IDFA—<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identifier_for_Advertisers">ID For Advertisers</a>—in the first place. (And never mind that they <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/03/apple-forcing-developers-to-ditch-unique-device-ids/">created IDFA back in 2013</a> partly to wean advertisers from tracking and targeting phones’ UDIDs (unique device IDs).</p>
<p>Defaulting the master Tracking setting to ON means Felix has to tap “Ask App Not To Track” for every single one of those hangers-on. Meaning that one click won’t vaporize all those apps at once. Just one at a time. This too is misleading as well as unserious.</p>
<p>And why “ask” an app not to track? Why not “tell”? Or, better yet,&nbsp;“Prevent Tracking By This App”? Does asking an app not to track mean it won’t?</p>
<p>History has an answer for those questions.</p>
<p>Remember&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track">Do Not Track</a>? Invented in the dawn of tracking, back in the late ’00s, it’s still a setting in every one of our browsers. But it too is just an ask—and ignored by nearly every website on Earth.</p>
<p>Here is how the setting looks, buried deep on Google’s Chrome:</p>
<p></p>
<p>It’s hardly worth bothering to turn that on (it’s defaulted to off), because it became clear long ago that Do Not Track was utterly defeated by the adtech biz and its dependents in online publishing. The standard itself was morphed to meaninglessness at the W3C, where by the end (in 2019) it got re-branded “<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/tracking-dnt/">Tracking Preference Expression</a>.” (As if any of us has a preference for tracking other than to make it not happen or go away.)</p>
<p>By the way, thanks to adtech’s defeat of Do Not Track in 2014, people took matters into their own hands, by installing ad and tracking blockers en masse, turning ad blocking, an option that had been laying around since 2004, into <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2015/09/28/beyond-ad-blocking-the-biggest-boycott-in-human-history/">the biggest boycott in world history</a>&nbsp;by 2015.</p>
<p>And now we have one large company, Apple, making big and (somewhat, as we see above) bold moves toward respecting personal privacy. That’s good as far as it goes. But how far is that, exactly? To see how far, here are some questions:</p>
 
 Will “asking” apps not to track on an iPhone actually make an app not track? 
 How will one be able to tell? 
 What auditing and accounting mechanisms are in place—on your phone, on the apps’ side, or at Apple? 
 
<p>As for people’s responses to Apple’s new setting, <a href="https://www.flurry.com/blog/ios-14-5-opt-in-rate-att-restricted-app-tracking-transparency-worldwide-us-daily-latest-update/">here are some numbers</a>&nbsp;for a three-week time frame: April 26 to May 16. They come from <a href="https://www.verizonmedia.com/our-brands/flurry">FLURRY</a>, a subsidiary of <a href="https://www.verizonmedia.com/">Verizon Media</a>, which is an adtech company. I’ll summarize:</p>
 
 For “Worldwide daily op-in rate after iOS 14.5 launch across all apps,” expressed as “% of mobile active app users who allow app tracking among uses who have chosen to either allow or deny tracking” started at 11% and rose to 15%. 
 The “U.S. Daily opt-in rate after iOS launch across all apps,” expressed as “% of mobile active app users who allow app tracking among users who have chosen to either allow or deny tracking” started at 2% and rose to 6%. 
 The “Worldwide daily opt-in rate across apps that have displayed the prompt,” expressed as “% of mobile active app users who allow app tracking among users who have chosen to either allow or deny tracking” started at 31% and went down to 24%. 
 The “Worldwide daily share of mobile app users with ‘restricted’ app tracking” (that’s where somebody goes into Settings—&gt;Privacy—&gt;Tracking and switches off “Allow Apps to Request to Track”), expressed as “% of mobile active app users who cannot be tracked by default and don’t have a choice to select a tracking option” started and stayed within a point of 5% . 
 And the “U.S. daily share of mobile app users with ‘restricted’ app tracking,” expressed as “% of mobile active app users who cannot be tracked by default and don’t have a choice to select a tracking option” started at 4% and ended at 3%, with some dips to 2%. 
 
<p>Clearly tracking isn’t popular, but those first two numbers should cause concern for those who want tracking to stay unpopular. The adtech business is relentless in advocacy of tracking, constantly pitching stories about how essential tracking-based “relevant,” “personalized” and “interest-based” advertising is—for you, and for the “free” Web and Internet.</p>
<p>It is also essential to note that Apple does advertising as well. <a href="https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2021/5/13/apples-ads-music">Here’s Benedict Evans</a> on a slope for Apple that is slippery in several ways:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apple has built up its own ad system on the iPhone, which records, tracks and targets users and serves them ads, but does this on the device itself rather than on the cloud, and only its own apps and services. Apple tracks lots of different aspects of your behaviour and uses that data to put you into anonymised interest-based cohorts and serve you ads that are targeted to your interests, in the App Store, Stocks and News apps. You can read Apple’s description of that <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT205223">here</a> – Apple is tracking a lot of user data, but nothing leaves your phone. Your phone is tracking you, but it doesn’t tell anyone anything.</p>
<p>This is conceptually pretty similar to Google’s proposed <a href="https://github.com/WICG/floc">FLoC</a>, in which your Chrome web browser uses the web pages you visit to put you into anonymised interest-based cohorts without your browsing history itself leaving your device. Publishers (and hence advertisers) can ask Chrome for a cohort and serve you an appropriate ad rather than tracking and targeting you yourself. Your browser is tracking you, but it doesn’t tell anyone anything -except for that anonymous cohort.</p>
<p>Google, obviously, wants FLoC to be a generalised system used by third-party publishers and advertisers. At the moment, Apple runs its own cohort tracking, publishing and advertising as a sealed system. It has begun selling <a href="https://searchads.apple.com/uk/help/advanced/0071-book-search-tab-campaigns/">targeted ads</a> inside the App Store (at precisely the moment that it crippled third party app install ads with IDFA), but it isn’t offering this tracking and targeting to anyone else. Unlike FLoC, an advertiser, web page or app can’t ask what cohort your iPhone has put you in – only Apple’s apps can do that, including the app store.</p>
<p>So, the obvious, cynical theory is that Apple decided to cripple third-party app install ads just at the point that it was poised to launch its own, and to weaken the broader smartphone ad model so that companies would be driven towards in-app purchase instead. (The even more cynical theory would be that Apple expects to lose a big chunk of App Store commission as a result of lawsuits and so plans to replace this with app install ads. I don’t actually believe this – amongst other things I think Apple believes it will win its Epic and Spotify cases.)</p>
<p>Much more interesting, though, is what happens if Apple opens up its cohort tracking and targeting, and says that apps, or Safari, can now serve anonymous, targeted, private ads without the publisher or developer knowing the targeting data. It could create an API to serve those ads in Safari and in apps, without the publisher knowing what the cohort was or even without knowing what the ad was. What if Apple offered that, and described it as a truly ‘private, personalised’ ad model, on a platform with at least 60% of US mobile traffic, and over a billion global users?…</p>
<p>Apple has a tendency to build up strategic assets in discrete blocks and small parts of products, and then combine them into one. It’s been planning to shift the Mac to its own silicon for close to a decade, and added biometrics to its products before adding Apple Pay and then a credit card. Now it has Apple Pay and ‘Sign in with Apple’ as new building blocks on the web, that might be combined into other things. It seems pretty obvious that Privacy is another of those building blocks, deployed step by step in lots of different places. Privacy has been good business for Apple, and advertising is a bigger business than all of those.</p></blockquote>
<p>All of which is why I’ve lately been thinking that privacy is a losing battle on the Web. And that we need to start <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/vrm/2021/05/05/a-new-way/">building a byway</a> around the whole mess: one where demand can signal supply about&nbsp;exactly what it wants, rather than having demand constantly being spied on and guessed at by adtech’s creepy machinery.</p>

  <p>Summary:      X.509 certificates have been around for 40 years and have proven to be a trustworthy means of exchanging data. So, what are the differences between X.509 ceritificates and SSI? And what are the advantages of each?</p>



<p>
    I sometimes talk to people who ask "Why do we need SSI? What's wrong with X.509 certificates?" Here's some thoughts. 
</p>

<p>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509">X.509</a> is a standard that defines the format for public key certificates. Public key certificates can be used to tie a public key to other information. The most common use, by far, is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">TLS/SSL</a>, the basis for trust in HTTPS, the protocol that secures the Web. In TLS,  the certificate binds a public key to a domain name (and perhaps other information).
</p>

<p>
    The first challenge for many people is determining whether X.509 certificates are more like <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/12/verifiable_credential_exchange.shtml">verifiable credentials</a> or <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/02/decentralized_identifiers.shtml">DIDDocs</a>. This is understandable since X.509 combines the functions of these two separate SSI standards. X.509 certificates themselves are like DIDDocs in that they bind information to a public key. But the hierarchical public key infrastructure (PKI) of X.509 is meant to attest to the veracity of the the X.509 certificate. And X.509 extensions allow other information to be included. So, X.509 certificates also bind the public key (as an identifier) to real-world attributes. DIDDocs don't have anything like PKI. Rather SSI uses verifiable credentials to assert information about a decentralized identifier in a trustworthy way.
</p>

<p>
    Another important difference between X.509 certificates and DIDDocs is that the primary purpose of the DIDDoc is to bind the public key in the DIDDoc to a decentralized identifier, or DID, whereas X.509 certificates can bind the public key to a subject name and other information like a domain name. Extensions to the certificate allow it to also bind the public key to other information. The important distinction is that the DID is required and represents a unique name for the DIDDoc.  A DID must have some means of resolving to the DIDDoc1. The DID provides a level of indirection to the public key. Consequently, the public key associated with a DID can be rotated without changing the DID and so it can be used as a permanent identifier. I won't get into the details around how this is done securely, but you can read far more detail at <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml">The Architecture of Identity Systems</a> if you're curious. 
</p>

<p>
    The veracity of an X.509 certificate is usually determined from the strictly hierarchical public key infrastructure (PKI). For example, when you visit a web site, your browser uses the X.509 certificate from the web site to establish a secure connection. If you click on the lock, you'll see information about that certificate. The web site's certificate was signed by some organization that is attesting to the information in the certificate. You can use the certificate of the signing organization to know its public key to do the check. But how do you know that certificate is valid? It's signed using the private key whose public key is in yet another certification, and so on. Eventually this has to stop and it does when you get to a certificate that was stored in browser when it was built. <a href="https://cabforum.org/">CA Browser Forum</a> is the organization that determines what certificates are worthy to be inside browsers. 
</p>


	<a></a>
	Showing the Certificate Hierarchy in Brave (click to enlarge)


<p>
    In contrast, the veracity of the DID and associated DIDDoc is ascertained by a heterarchical method. The DID and DIDDoc are <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml#autonomic">self-asserted and self-certifying</a>. You can use cryptographic means to determine that the binding asserted in the DIDDoc has not been tampered with, but the DID infrastructure itself does nothing to tell you who or what the DID is bound to in a verifiable way. For that, we use verifiable credentials. 
</p>

<p>
    Suppose the DID in question is one Alice generated to give to Bravo Corp, her mortgage processor. Bravo knows nothing about the DID they've received except that it's bound, in the associated DIDDoc, with a specific public key (and possibly an endpoint of some kind). They ask Alice to prove things about herself as part of the mortgage application process and over time learn quite a bit. Alice proves her name and date of birth using a verifiable credential representing her driver's license. She proves her income using a verifiable credential from her employer, and her banking information using a verifiable credential from her bank. The information in each of these verifiable credentials is attested by its issuer: the DMV, the employer, and the bank.  Bravo's reasons for trusting these organization are up to Bravo:
</p>
 
     The may be well known. 
     Bravo may have a prior relationship with them. 
     Bravo might ask them to prove things about themselves (using verifiable credentials, of course). 
     Or they may belong to a trust framework that Bravo can use access publicly.  
 

<p>
    Furthermore, zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)2 allow Alice to combine the attributes in these various credentials (and others) in a way that only discloses what Bravo is asking for and nothing more. And her digital wallet was able to do this for her automatically without Alice having to pick and choose the various attributes from various credentials herself. The proof shows that the information from these three credentials is all bound to the person who controls the DID that Alice gave to Bravo. The proof also shows that these credentials have not been revoked. 
</p>

<p>
    You can imagine Alice having X.509 certificates from the DMV, her employer, and her bank that attest these same things (through X.509 extensions). She would also have a personal certificate with her public key that she used to anchor each of these other certificates. The X.509 certificates are not linked in any way other than Alice's public key. She has to use the same public key in all of them so they can be correlated. She uses her personal certificate to prove she's in control of the public key she provides to the DMV, employer, and bank. If she changes her public key, so has to get new certificates. This is a good example of the dual nature of X.509 certificates. Alice's personal certificate looks like a DIDDoc, but the certificates with extensions look like verifiable credentials. 
</p>

<p>
    There's no easy way for Alice to restrict what attributes she shares when she shares these certificates. She has to share the entire certificate. Bravo would trust these certificates in the same way your browser does, by following the chain to some smallish set of trusted certificate authorities fo each kind of certificate (driver's license, employer, or bank). Bravo would also check certificate revocation lists for each certificate to ensure they're still valid.
</p>

<p>
    The advantage of X.509 certificates is that the technology, processes, and governance behind them are well-known and understood. No small thing.  The public key infrastructure is well developed with a long history of securely communicating trustworthy public keys. DIDs and verifiable credentials are relatively new. Although standards, open source code, and multiple vendors exist, they are unproven compared to X.509. 
</p>

<p>
    So, why do something new? DIDs, DIDDocs, and verifiable credentials have several advantages over X.509 certificates:
</p>
 
     DIDs are more secure. DIDs allow public keys to be rotated in a trustworthy manner. Consequently, Alice can rotate the key underlying the DID at will without having to get new credentials. The identifier lives as long as Alice needs it to. Alice won't be tempted to hold onto a potentially comprimised key because she's worried about the inconvenience. 
     SSI uses the right tools for each part of the process. The SSI architecture cleanly separates providing an identifier for Alice from proving things about Alice. The binding between the DID and its associated public key can be verified cryptographically without relying on a hierarchical chain of authorities. The <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/10/fidelity_provenance_and_trust.shtml">fidelity</a> of the credential exchange can be verified cryptographically using information in a public credential registry (often a ledger of some sort). This separation allows the methods and tools to be crafted to the needs of each kind of document. 
     
     Verifiable credentials minimize information disclosure. Sharing only what's necessary protects Alice's privacy. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnbNtjsKb4k&amp;t=1705s">Webinar on ZKP-oriented Credentials</a> from Daniel Hardman is an excellent, approachable tutorial on the many benefits of ZKPs for credential exchange. 
     SSI data sharing UX is safer. ZKPs provide convenience for Alice saving her time, and reducing the chance of her oversharing through human error (i.e. they are safer from a privacy perspective).  
     SSI has a consistent UX. SSI wallets and agents provide a good user experience for managing relationships, storing credentials, and responding to proof requests. As far as I know, X.509 certificate wallets do not exist as such, so they would need to be developed to provide a comparable user experience.  
     Verifiable credentials provide better interoperability. Alice is able to use multiple credentials from different issuers and prove things to many verifiers because of standards, not just for data formats, but also protocols for issuace and presentment. I know of no standards for how X.509 credentials can be used to prove the kind of information in the mortgage example in an interoperable way. They have been around for over 40 years and yet they are almost exclusively used for TLS and nothing else.  
 

<p>
    The high-level goals of X.509 certificates are similar to those of DIDs and verifiable credentials. But DIDs and verifiable credentials represent an innovation that takes learnings from 40 years of experience and new developments in cryptography into account to provide a better, more flexible solution to the problem of exchanging data in a trustworthy way. SSI in the form of DIDs and verifiable credentials promise a global, interoperable data exchange metasystem that is cryptographically sound with an excellent user experience. 
</p>


 

<a></a>
 Notes 
 
     The resolution need not be global or public. For Peer DIDs, the resolution is local. 
     Note that not all credential exchange methods use ZKPs. They should.

We will probably decide next week to progress the draft to foundation-wide review.  In particular, there’s been interest recently in both Entity Statements and Automatic Registration among those working on Self-Issued OpenID Provider extensions.  Reviews of those features would be particularly welcome.</p>
<p>The updated specification is published at:</p>

  <p>Summary:      Natural anonymity comes from our ability to recognize others without the aid of an external identity system. Online interactions will only be able to mirror life-like anonymity when we can use decentralized identity systems that don't force all interactions to be under the purview of centralized, administrative identity systems.</p>



<p>
    Doc Searls published a piece last week entitled <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2021/05/14/poison/">"How the Cookie Poisoned the Web"</a>. Doc points to various privacy ills of Web 2.0 and in each instance says "Blame the cookie." Doc's larger point is that the web started out as a peer-to-peer publishing system that was wholly decentralized and gave everyone equal voice.
</p>

<p>
    Doc continues:
</p>
<blockquote>
    But gradually a poison disabled personal agency. That poison was the cookie.
</blockquote>
<p>
    Very few web sites in the early web had identity systems. For the peer-to-peer sharing of documents and discovery via embedded links, none were needed. HTTP, the foundational protocol of the web is stateless, meaning the HTTP server does not know whether any two requests are related to each other.
</p>

<p>
    Stateless is fine for document sharing and linking using hypertext. But it makes building a shopping cart really hard. Back in the mid-90's figuring out how to build a functional shopping cart was on everyone's mind, mine included. I was the cofounder and CTO of an early ecommerce site, imall.com. Without changing HTTP, the most promising strategy was to include a correlation identifier in all the links generated by the site, so we'd know who was making the request. But this was buggy and caused lots of customer support issues.
</p>

<p>
    A correlation identifier is a unique string that can be used to link requests. Ultimately, the the HTTP community added a correlation identifier called a "cookie" (which took its name from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_cookie">correlation identifier used in unix</a>). HTTP cookies are generated by the server and stored on the browser. Whenever the browser makes a request to the server, it sends back the cookie, allowing the server to correlate all requests from that browser.
</p>

<p>
    That all sounds innocuous enough and in theory, it is. But the devil is in the details. If I'm shopping on imall.com, I want the site to keep track of me because that provides utility and convenience. But it turns out that most web pages are not a single chunk of HTML that the server sends down. They have lots of other things, like javascript files and images, embedded in them too. These other things don't have to be from the same server. Each of those servers can set a cookie as well. And since they know where they were linked from, they can correlate activity across multiple websites.
</p>

<p>
    This is how (simple) ad tracking works. When you see an ad on web site A, it's being served from a server owned by an ad company that web site A has an agreement with. The ad server plants a cookie in your browser. Now you visit web site B that also includes ads from the same ad server. Your browser dutifully reports the ad server cookie back to the ad server along with the information that the ad was on web site B. The company running the ad server now knows you were on web site A and web site B (along with lots of other metadata). Rather than correlating requests on a single web site, they are using cookies to correlate your activity across the web.
</p>

<p>
    This is the poison Doc is talking about. The web cookie, as designed, goes well beyond correlating activity on a single web site for purposes of creating some utility like a shopping cart or a chat server. The web cookie allows correlating activities of people across the web. And it doesn't stop with your browsing history. The ad company starts knowing other things about you (because the web sites you visit tell them) and soon they can develop a comprehensive dossier.
</p>

<a></a>
 Like-Like Anonymity and the Administrative Internet 

<p>
    In real life, we often interact with others—both people and institutions—with relative anonymity. For example, if I go the store and buy a coke with cash there is no exchange of identity information necessary. Even if I use a credit card it's rarely the case that the entire transaction happens under the administrative authority of the identity system inherent in the credit card. Only the financial part of the transaction takes place in that identity system. This is true of most interactions in real life.
</p>

<p>
    In contrast, in the digital world, very few meaningful transactions are done outside of some administrative identity system. There are several reasons why identity is so important in the digital world:
</p>

 
     
        Continuity—While web sessions can be pseudonymous, as we've seen, they are often correlated across multiple independent sessions and devices using an authenticated correlation identifier. This allows, for example, the customer to have a shopping cart that not only persists across time but also on different devices.
     
     
        Convenience—So long as the customer is authenticating, we might as well further store additional information like addresses and credit card numbers for their convenience, to extend the shopping example. Storing these allows the customer to complete transactions without having to enter the same information over and over.
     
     
        Trust—There are some actions that should only be taken by certain people, or people in certain roles, or with specific attributes. Once a shopping site has stored my credit card, for example, I ought to be the only one who can use it. Identity systems provide authentication mechanisms as the means of knowing who is at the other end of the wire so that we know what actions they're allowed to take. This places identifiers in context so they can be trusted.
     
     
        Surveillance—Unfortunately, identity systems also provide the means of tracking individuals across transactions for purposes of gathering data about them. This data gathering may be innocuous or nefarious, but there is no doubt that it is enabled by identity systems in use on the internet.
     
 

<p>
    In real life, we do without identity systems for most things. You don't have to identify yourself to the movie theater to watch a movie or log into some system to sit in a restaurant and have a private conversation with friends. In real life, we act as embodied, independent agents. Our physical presence and the laws of physics have a lot to do with our ability to function with workable anonymity across many domains.
</p>


<p>
    So, how did we get surveillance and it's attendant affects on natural anonymity as an unintended, but oft-exploited feature of administrative digital identity systems? Precisely because they are administrative.
</p>

<a></a>
 Legibility 

<p>
    Legibility is a term used to describe how administrative systems make things governable by simplifying, inventorying, and rationalizing things around them. James C. Scott's seminal book, Seeing Like a State, nicely analyzes legibility and its unintended consequences. Venkatesh Rao has a <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/26/a-big-little-idea-called-legibility/">great summary</a> if you'd like the TL;DR.
</p>

<blockquote> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00D8JJYWA/windleyofente-20">Seeing Like a State: How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed by James C. Scott</a> <p>In this wide-ranging and original book, James C. Scott analyzes failed cases of large-scale authoritarian plans in a variety of fields. Centrally managed social plans misfire, Scott argues, when they impose schematic visions that do violence to complex interdependencies that are not—and cannot—be fully understood. Further, the success of designs for social organization depends upon the recognition that local, practical knowledge is as important as formal, epistemic knowledge. </p><p></p></blockquote>

<p>
    Identity systems make people legible in order to offer continuity, convenience, and trust. But, as we've seen, that legibility also allows surveillance. In some respects, this is the trade off we always get with administrative systems. By creating legibility, administrative systems threaten privacy.
</p>

<p>
    Administrative systems are centralized. They are owned. They are run for the purposes of their owners, not the purposes of the people or things being administered. They are bureaucracies for governing something. They rely on rules, procedures, and formal interaction patterns. Need a new password? Be sure to follow the password rules of what ever administrative system you're in.
</p>

<p>
    Every interaction you have online happens under the watchful eye of a bureaucracy built to govern the system and the people using it. The bureaucracy may be benevolent, benign, or malevolent but it controls the interaction and people pay the price of the interpretive work necessary to figure out how it functions.
</p>

<a></a>
 Real Life is Decentralized 

<p>
    On the other hand, in real life we interact as peers. We do interact with administrative systems of various sorts, but no one would describe that as real life. When I go to a store, I don't think about shopping within their administrative system. Rather, I walk in, look at stuff, talk to people, put things in a cart, and check out. The administrative system is there, but it's for governing the store, not the customers.
</p>
<p>
    We can't have online interactions that feel like real life until we redecentralize the internet. The internet started out decentralized. The early web was decentralized. But the need for continuity, convenience, and trust led more and more interactions to happen within someone's administrative system.
</p>

<p>
    Most online administrative systems make themselves as unobtrusive as they can. But there's no getting around the fact that every move we make is within a system that knows who we are and monitors what we're doing. In real life, I don't rely on the administrative system of the restaurant to identify the people I'm having dinner with. The restaurant doesn't need to check our IDs or surveil us in order to create an environment where we can talk and enjoy a meal together.
</p>

<p>
    The good news is that we're finally developing the tools necessary to create decentralized online experiences. What if you could interact with your friends online on the basis of an identity that they bring to you directly—one that you could recognize and trust? You wouldn't need Facebook or WhatsApp to identify and track your friends for you.
</p>

<p>
    Decentralized identity is the foundation for a decentralized web—a web that flexibly supports the kind of ad hoc interactions people have with each other all the time in real life. Until we do, we'll never get an online world that mirrors real life and its natural anonymity.

     <br><p>Day zero of being a #CDO is probably not the best day to ask difficult questions; however, sometimes, there is no better day.&nbsp; The first question to ask the executive leadership team as you walk around being introduced might be: “What is the one thing that we, as a team and organisation, want our data to drive, deliver or provide?”</p><p>You might want to wait to ask this question and first determine what tools are being used. This will frame what outcomes and decisions are being supported.&nbsp; The question and answers allow you to determine if there is an alignment or gap between “What is the one thing that we, as a team and organisation what our data to drive, deliver or provide?”&nbsp; and what will happen anyway because of tools, processes and legacy.&nbsp; One critical aspect of being a #CDO is determining how our processes and methods only enable certain decisions to be made, but we have to unpack legacy.</p><p>Legacy within this framing is threefold. Decisions. Decisions. Decisions. These are:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>Decisions that created processes, methods and rules which were created by previous incentives and power games; and are now ghosts in the systems. These decisions were taken so long ago that no one knows why, how or when it was decided.&nbsp; It is the way we do it; it is our IP, our brand.</p>  <p>Decisions that created “information and technology debt” included embedded and baked-in systems, hidden, and no-longer supported code, and automation based on tools and data biased when created.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Decisions that created noise in the hierarchy to lose or filter signals that someone did not want to hear.&nbsp; It was the creation of layers, reports, practices, structural regulation and unchallenged assumptions.</p>  <p>Unpacking legacy questions will take time, and you will not be ready on Day-0. Therefore any responses you get have to be framed within such understanding when it arrives.&nbsp; It is worth asking the question and then verifying before becoming blind to the tools that mould you.&nbsp;</p><p>“What is the one thing that we, as a team and organisation what our data to drive, deliver or provide? &nbsp;Well, it could be:</p>  <p>Evidence-based, actionable insights</p>  <p>What should we automate?</p>  <p>How do we know we are doing the right thing?</p>  <p>Where are there efficiencies to be gained?</p>  <p>What do customers really want?</p>  <p>How to manipulate customers to increase margin and revenues?</p>  <p>Where are risks that we cannot see?</p>  <p>What is being hidden that we cannot see?</p>  <p>If you look at this list in the context of what tools and decisions already frame the response, are these what we are looking for data to answer or are we looking to data to affirm/ justify what we have already decided.&nbsp; A different response that no one will say “to justify what we are already doing!”</p><p>Data has bias because of previous decisions. Therefore, a #CDO has to find non-data tools to check what decisions from the past are biasing the current data, processes and tools. We cannot usefully answer the question we have set ourselves “What is the one thing that we, as a team and organisation what our data to drive, deliver or provide? without understanding the situation.</p><p>The CTO knows that they have to build a new platform when the bug list, new feature development and maintenance costs are bigger and will take more time than developing a new platform - this is the technology debt question.&nbsp; As the #CDO, you have to understand what is your information debt. The CTO will struggle as there is no clear path from policy to code. Similarly, the CDO, we struggle with no clear path from policy (what one thing) to better data for the decisions we require.&nbsp; You inherit and are now accountable for previous decisions, which constrain what is now possible as the biased tool has created what we have. The costs of collecting, labelling, holding, sorting and creating training data continually increase, creating a more significant gap and misalignment in values and expectations from data.</p><p>“We become what we behold. We shape our tools, and then our tools shape us”&nbsp; is often mistakenly attributed to Marshall McLuhan (as in the image above) and called McLuhan Law. The quote was actually written by Father John Culkin, SJ, a Professor of Communication at Fordham University in New York and friend of McLuhan. Such is the problem with data.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps the opening question is the wrong one? Perhaps we should reflect on these questions as a leadership team.</p>  <p>What do we want to become, and what tools and data will help us?</p>  <p>What tools do we use, and what will they enable us to become?&nbsp;</p>  <p>What is the minimum viable data set required to give the best value?&nbsp;</p>  <p>Do our tools and data trap us?</p>  <br>

<p>ZmartZone has implemented OAuth 2.0 Resource Server functionality in Apache/NGINX modules so these components can be used as a reverse proxy in front of APIs or other backends. In such a setup the backend does not have to deal with security but outsources it to a proxy sitting in front of it in a similar way that TLS termination is often offloaded to a load-balancer.</p>



<p>Most of the OAuth 2.0 deployments today use so-called bearer access tokens that are easy to deploy and use. This type of access token is not bound to the Client presenting the token which means that an attacker intercepting an access token can just use that token to get access to the resources/APIs/services as if it were the Client. So called Proof-of-Possession semantics for access tokens prevent that type of attack and present a more secure setup but such a system is typically harder to implement, deploy and maintain. </p>



<p>A relative simple variant of Proof-of-Possession for access tokens is specified in <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8705">RFC 8705 OAuth 2.0 Mutual-TLS Client Authentication and Certificate-Bound Access Tokens</a>. This  specification leverages a (possibly self-signed) certificate held by the Client to bind an access token cryptographically to the private key associated with that certificate.</p>



<p>This specification is implemented in <a href="https://github.com/zmartzone/liboauth2/releases/tag/v1.4.1">liboauth2 1.4.1</a> which is used in the Apache module <a href="https://github.com/zmartzone/mod_oauth2/releases/tag/v3.2.1">mod_oauth2 3.2.1</a>. This means that you can now require and verify OAuth 2.0 certificate bound access tokens for your API in a very simple way that is easy to deploy. All it takes is an Apache server in front of your API, configured with something like:</p>



<p><code>AuthType oauth2<br>OAuth2TokenVerify jwk "{\"kty\":\"RSA\",\"kid\":\"one\",\"use\":\"sig\",\"n\":\"...\",\"e\":\"AQAB\" }" type=mtls&amp;mtls.policy=optional<br>SSLVerifyClient optional_no_ca</code></p>

It was where a human was held responsible and accountable.&nbsp; The issue of oversight becomes very differnt when we have automation and machines/ AI make decisions for us, how do we know who decides?&nbsp; Our questions will not cut it. &nbsp;</p><p>When we apply our old governance, old oversight, old accountable models and old frameworks to new problems, it feels like there is a disconnect and there is a level of dysfunctionality as the old model was not designed for the new problems.&nbsp; There is a forward capability; insomuch that old problems can be addressed better on the new systems, but the old systems cannot help solve or answer new questions.&nbsp; There is a backwards capability issue (not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_compatibility">backwards compatibility</a>), just like you cannot run the latest software on the early computers.&nbsp;</p><p>We appear to be right now lost (which the media portrays as division or civilisation collapse creating divides to gain clicks and generate revenue). In reality, we are transitioning from "Physical"&nbsp; to "Information" beings.&nbsp; I take comfort that the best minds at MIT cannot decide either:&nbsp; Atoms to Bits OR&nbsp; Bits to Atoms. We know if MIT is wrestling, then we are in a transition.</p><p>The transition to information beings is reaching a chasm or hurdle, as the old model, which we depended on for governance and oversight, is at the edge of its limits.&nbsp; Data can perfectly tell us how effective and efficient everything is, including the deviance to plan, but data could not tell us if the plan was right or if we are doing the right thing, efficacy.&nbsp; We depended on the oversight model of humans for this.&nbsp; The former, efficiency, is easy, the latter being really quite tricky as it is so contextual to the moment in time and values/ principles we currently hold.&nbsp; Data can tell us from where we came, our models based on said data can suggest where we will go, but as yet, we cannot determine if we should. As an adventurer, I tend to do it anyway, ignoring should, because it is there, and my scars are evidence that it does not always work out well.&nbsp;</p><p>The data, models, algorithms, ML and AI we have now created are capable of informing us if it is the right thing to do, but how do we know?</p><p>Writing things down, TV, Radio, Social media, books, screens, and printing created threats to established power structures that the old system of control adapted to embrace the new technology over time. However, I believe that the current oversight, governance, compliance and regulatory controls, which are based on the last 5000 years of adaption as physical beings, which are not bad in truth, CANNOT adapt to the next evolution from physical to information. Indeed our infrastructure gave rise to data, which is creating us as information beings.&nbsp; Our current models of helping us determine if we are doing the right thing fall apart as we evolve to become information beings because of a shift in power and control. Our current oversight was not designed for autonomous decision-making by a non-human, and whilst the old methods have adopted too many situations, this move to information beings appears, right now, to break the capabilities of current governance.&nbsp;</p><p>We feel the gap when we read the news but don’t as yet have the language or words to describe it. &nbsp; We deny and hide from this reality by focussing on back to normal growth and trying to create new models.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Governance follows change; it does not lead to a change. Governance and oversight help set up stability when we arrive at a new place. It is a flywheel for path dependency until someone breaks the axel. We are lucky to be alive now, seeing and witnessing this transition and can apply our minds to support this.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>as physical beings over generations, we learn that&nbsp;</p>  <p>power and control matter</p>  <p>monopoly and scale in a vertical matter</p>  <p>accountable and responsible limited to the very narrow works, and we can ignore any wider consequences&nbsp;</p>  <p>relationships have limited context</p>  <p>values and principles change slowly, allowing for rules to create an impression of stability</p>  <p>governance and oversight work to determine if we are doing the right thing by slowing decision time, filtering noise and hierarchy to create signals</p>  <br><p>as informational beings, we have not quite worked out the new game, however;</p>  <p>information and data must have attestation and rights as they matter</p>  <p>real-time learning models with computational power really matters</p>  <p>dependent and inter-dependence ecosystems ensure consequences matter</p>  <p>commons and the quality of the human experience on earth matter</p>  <p>collective and individual accountability and responsibility enable oversight in real-time</p>  <br><p>I believe we feel lost and vulnerable as we are starting to see that our lack of diversity, biased education, retention of power and control mechanisms, along with oversight and governance, worked for some of us some of the time as physical beings.&nbsp; However, they are not suitable when we arrive at "information beings," wanting everything to work for most people most of the time. Utopia is still a dream.&nbsp; We are at the start of a journey, and right now, we lack language, words, stories, rhetoric, meaning, models, structures, frameworks and a north star.&nbsp;</p><p>We know that growth fuels increasing salaries which is a mechanism for control by creating more debt, as you can borrow more.&nbsp; Growth hides and maintains the lie about change for longer. It is the flywheel. Increasing lifestyles create more people who have to remain aligned,&nbsp; the balance of sufficient salary to have enough debt that you remain conformist and will do as needed.&nbsp; Data means we can now pick up signals from employees about who is a conformist because of debt/ trapped.&nbsp; They are the easiest to corrupt, will be the weak link in the security chain, allows someone to control or exert undue influence - keep the model and the belief.&nbsp; The wheels are coming off, and the axels are breaking.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>What happens when AI (who is not paid) and is not aligned to the power plays makes decisions for the best outcome.&nbsp; How will you control the AI, like we use salary for humans?</p><p>Such interesting times</p> <br>

   <p></p><p>Source:&nbsp; worth observing that this <a href="https://dilbert.com/strip/1993-02-11">Dilbert was 1993 !!!!&nbsp;</a></p><p>Radar and sonar are incredible inventions as they allow us to perceive what cannot be actually seen with the naked eye.&nbsp; As technology has advance and big data analysis has emerged we have gone from a simple echo to high-quality resolution.&nbsp; However, the peak value for Radar is that it informs you something is there which requires low resolution and very little data.&nbsp; As Radar resolution has improved we can get direction and speed which requires a little more time. This new information definitely adds value to any required reactive decision. The identification of what the actual object is through increased resolution has an incremental value but not as much as knowing it is there and what direction at what speed but such information can lead to a better decision but suddenly there is an economics of cost compared to the incremental improvement in outcome.&nbsp; Knowing what type of bird by species or what plane by manufacturer, does add cost and size of data set but it does not add any value in terms of the decision requirement.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, current data scientists, enthusiasts and idealists are asking you to store vast quantities of data from your customer and eco-system in the hope that at some point the algorithms and AI technology will give you new rich and deep insights, such as the equivalent resolution of what rivet types are used in construction for the inbound missile for Radar. We have to question when even though technically possible,&nbsp; does the resolution stop adding value?</p><p>The more data you collect the better the decisions you will be able to make in the future is a lie that is driving boards to take on the cost for data and data risk that is beyond their scope of any calculatable return.&nbsp; “Collect all the data and store it as you don’t know what we might discover” is hope and choice, it is not a rational business decision. The hope is wrapped up in a power pitch that our competitive advantage will be the discovery and ability to perform magical acts of mind manipulation which will supercharge sales through the control of customers. Or is it fear that everyone else will have this and we will have no future, FOMO of the big data promise.&nbsp;</p><p>Investing in the future is a fantastic idea when collecting moon or martian dust and storing it until we improve our science tools and instruments but for a company right now this is a lie. &nbsp; We are collecting and storing data in the hope that an algorithm will be able to mine more value than the cost of collecting, storing and algorithm development.&nbsp; Right now there is little evidence from all the work done that using data to change behaviour works at scale.&nbsp; This is a real cost today for “hope,” which the CFO has not found an ethical way to put on a balance sheet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We have been sold a vision the more data we have the better decisions and insights we will have. Any data scientist or statistician will confirm that resolution of a decision or insight will not substantially improve beyond a certain data set size.&nbsp; You are not keeping and storing data for better decision making and insight today, just in the hope for new insights tomorrow. But the COO, CIO, CDO or CTO who is empire-building and determine that size equates to power within your culture are dependent on fear, uncertainty and doubt and insufficiently skilled directors to be able to challenge this. The tech looks like magic and every consulting company sees this as a revenue stream and write reports to support this view.</p><p>As a sceptic of the big data story, this article nicely aligns with your affinity and belief.&nbsp; You see that your next action is the stop the ever-increasing data spend and focus on traditional business.&nbsp; Whilst difficult to understand data is the right answer to business problems.&nbsp; The takeaway should be to question: Where is the diminishing return for data for your organisation?&nbsp; How do you know the data is good? How do you know the analysis is good. How do you know if what you are doing is the right thing to do? How do you incentive the right actions?</p><p>Data is not the problem, too much data will not create the return we hope for based on the cost we have, but we have to remain focussed that data is essential. How do we make data work for most of the people most of the time and not a few people on the odd occasion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This article shows how to implement an Angular single page application with an ASP.NET Core API and secured using the Open ID Connect code flow with PKCE and OAuth JWT Bearer tokens to protect the API. The identity provider is implemented using Auth0. The flow uses refresh tokens to renew the SPA session and the revocation endpoint is used to clean up the refresh tokens on logout. </p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/Auth0AngularAspNetCoreApi">https://github.com/damienbod/Auth0AngularAspNetCoreApi</a></p>



<p>Setup</p>



<p>The solutions consists of three parts, an ASP.NET Core API which would provide the data in a secure way, an Angular application which would use the data and the Auth0 service which is used as the identity provider. Both applications are registered in Auth0 and the refresh tokens are configured for the SPA. The API can be used from the SPA application. </p>







<p>Angular SPA Code flow PKCE with refresh tokens</p>



<p>The Angular Open ID Connect client is implemented using the npm package <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-auth-oidc-client">angular-auth-oidc-client</a>. The Auth0 client requires two special configurations to use an API. The audience is added as a custom parameter in the authorize request so that the required API can be used. The customParamsRefreshToken is used to add the scope parameter to the refresh request which is required by Auth0. The rest is standard Open ID Connect settings used for code flow using PKCE and refresh tokens.</p>


  import { APP_INITIALIZER, NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { AuthModule, LogLevel, OidcConfigService } from 'angular-auth-oidc-client';

export function configureAuth(oidcConfigService: OidcConfigService) {
  return () =&gt;
    oidcConfigService.withConfig({
      stsServer: 'https://dev-damienbod.eu.auth0.com',
      redirectUrl: window.location.origin,
      postLogoutRedirectUri: window.location.origin,
      clientId: 'Ujh5oSBAFr1BuilgkZPcMWEgnuREgrwU',
      scope: 'openid profile offline_access auth0-user-api-spa',
      responseType: 'code',
      silentRenew: true,
      useRefreshToken: true,
      logLevel: LogLevel.Debug,
      customParams: {
        audience: 'https://auth0-api-spa', // API app in Auth0
      },
      customParamsRefreshToken: {
        scope: 'openid profile offline_access auth0-user-api-spa',
      },
    });
}

@NgModule({
  imports: [AuthModule.forRoot()],
  providers: [
    OidcConfigService,
    {
      provide: APP_INITIALIZER,
      useFactory: configureAuth,
      deps: [OidcConfigService],
      multi: true,
    },
  ],
  exports: [AuthModule],
})
export class AuthConfigModule {}

  


<p>An AuthInterceptor class is used to add the access token to the API requests to the secure APIs which use the access token. It is important that the access token is only sent to the intended API and not every outgoing HTTP request.</p>


  import { HttpInterceptor, HttpRequest, HttpHandler } from '@angular/common/http';
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { AuthService } from './auth.service';

@Injectable()
export class AuthInterceptor implements HttpInterceptor {
  private secureRoutes = ['https://localhost:44390'];

  constructor(private authService: AuthService) {}

  intercept(
    request: HttpRequest&lt;any&gt;,
    next: HttpHandler
  ) {
    if (!this.secureRoutes.find((x) =&gt; request.url.startsWith(x))) {
      return next.handle(request);
    }

    const token = this.authService.token;

    if (!token) {
      return next.handle(request);
    }

    request = request.clone({
      headers: request.headers.set('Authorization', 'Bearer ' + token),
    });

    return next.handle(request);
  }
}

  


<p>ASP.NET Core API OAuth</p>



<p>The ASP.NET Core API allows requests from the calling SPA application. CORS is enabled for the application. The AddAuthentication method is used to add JWT bearer token security and the policies are added to verify the access token. The UseAuthentication method is used to add the security middleware.</p>


  public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
	// ...
	
	JwtSecurityTokenHandler.DefaultInboundClaimTypeMap.Clear();
	// IdentityModelEventSource.ShowPII = true;

	// only needed for browser clients
	services.AddCors(options =&gt;
	{
		options.AddPolicy("AllowAllOrigins",
			builder =&gt;
			{
				builder
					.AllowCredentials()
					.WithOrigins(
						"https://localhost:4204")
					.SetIsOriginAllowedToAllowWildcardSubdomains()
					.AllowAnyHeader()
					.AllowAnyMethod();
			});
	});

	services.AddAuthentication(options =&gt;
	{
		options.DefaultAuthenticateScheme = JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
		options.DefaultChallengeScheme = JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
	}).AddJwtBearer(options =&gt;
	{
		options.Authority = "https://dev-damienbod.eu.auth0.com/";
		options.Audience = "https://auth0-api-spa";
	});

	services.AddSingleton&lt;IAuthorizationHandler, UserApiScopeHandler&gt;();

	services.AddAuthorization(policies =&gt;
	{
		policies.AddPolicy("p-user-api-auth0", p =&gt;
		{
			p.Requirements.Add(new UserApiScopeHandlerRequirement());
			// Validate id of application for which the token was created
			p.RequireClaim("azp", "Ujh5oSBAFr1BuilgkZPcMWEgnuREgrwU");
		});
	});

	services.AddControllers(options =&gt;
	{
		var policy = new AuthorizationPolicyBuilder()
			.RequireAuthenticatedUser()
			.Build();
		options.Filters.Add(new AuthorizeFilter(policy));
	});
}

public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
	// ...
	
	app.UseCors("AllowAllOrigins");

	app.UseHttpsRedirection();

	app.UseRouting();

	app.UseAuthentication();
	app.UseAuthorization();

	app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =&gt;
	{
		endpoints.MapControllers();
	});
}

  


<p>The UserApiScopeHandler class implements the AuthorizationHandler to require the UserApiScopeHandlerRequirement requirement which is used as the policy.</p>


  public class UserApiScopeHandler : AuthorizationHandler&lt;UserApiScopeHandlerRequirement&gt;
{

	protected override Task HandleRequirementAsync(AuthorizationHandlerContext context, 
		UserApiScopeHandlerRequirement requirement)
	{
		if (context == null)
			throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(context));
		if (requirement == null)
			throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(requirement));

		var scopeClaim = context.User.Claims.FirstOrDefault(t =&gt; t.Type == "scope");

		if (scopeClaim != null)
		{
			var scopes = scopeClaim.Value.Split(" ", StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries);
			if (scopes.Any(t =&gt; t == "auth0-user-api-spa"))
			{
				context.Succeed(requirement);
			}
		}

		return Task.CompletedTask;
	}
}
  


<p>The UserOneController class uses the policy which validates the access token and the claims from the token.</p>


  [SwaggerTag("User access token protected using Auth0")]
[Authorize(Policy = "p-user-api-auth0")]
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class UserOneController : ControllerBase
{
	/// &lt;summary&gt;
	/// returns data id the correct Auth0 access token is used.
	/// &lt;/summary&gt;
	/// &lt;returns&gt;protected data&lt;/returns&gt;
	[HttpGet]
	[ProducesResponseType(StatusCodes.Status200OK)]
	[ProducesResponseType(StatusCodes.Status401Unauthorized)]
	public IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; Get()
	{
		return new List&lt;string&gt; { "user one data" };
	}
}
  


<p>Problems, notes, Improvements</p>



<p>Auth0 supports the revocation endpoint which is really good and so the refresh token can be revoked when the Angular application is logged out. This is really a MUST I think if using refresh tokens in the browser. It is not possible to revoke the access tokens so these remain valid after the SPA app logs out. You could reduce the lifespan of the access tokens which would improve this a bit. Auth0 does not support reference tokens and introspection which I would always use if using SPA authentication. Introspection could be supported by using a different identity provider. Using refresh token rotation is really important when using refresh tokens in the browser, this should also be configured.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Using Auth0 with an SPA means you cannot fully logout. The tokens are also stored somewhere in the browser, but at least the refresh token can be revoked which is really important. To improve security, you could switch to a BFF architecture and remove the tokens from the browser. Then it would also be possible to fully logout. The BFF also allows for client authentication and other security features which are not possible with an SPA. </p>

  <p>Summary:      This post features three fantastic books from three great, but quite different, authors on the subject of Big Tech, surveillance capitalism, and what's to be done about it.</p>


<p>
    I recently read Shoshana Zuboff's book on surveillance capitalism. Not only is the book thought provoking, but Zuboff's writing verges on the poetic at times, making it a delightful read. In her opening chapter she asks the question "Can the digital future be our home?"
</p>

<p>
    This question is perhaps one of the most important of our age. More and more of <a href="https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/">our lives are being intermediated by digital systems</a>. And yet those systems are not ours, but rather belong to the companies that provide them. And our experience on them is predicated on the goals, desires, and needs of those companies, not ours. I <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/cogito_ergo_sum.shtml">call these systems "administrative"</a> because they are built to administer our experience in a particular domain for the administrator's specific purposes.
</p>


<blockquote> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01N2QEZE2/windleyofente-20">The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power by 
    Shoshana Zuboff</a> <p>The challenges to humanity posed by the digital future, the first detailed examination of the unprecedented form of power called "surveillance capitalism," and the quest by powerful corporations to predict and control our behavior. In this masterwork of original thinking and research, Shoshana Zuboff provides startling insights into the phenomenon that she has named surveillance capitalism. The stakes could not be higher: a global architecture of behavior modification threatens human nature in the twenty-first century just as industrial capitalism disfigured the natural world in the twentieth.</p><p></p></blockquote>

<p>
    Zuboff makes a number of compelling arguments about why surveillance capitalism represents a significant threat to humanity's future. An overarching conclusion is that by putting everyone inside their administrative systems to make our lives legible to their surveillance, these companies become tyrants.
</p>

<blockquote>
    [T]yranny is the obliteration of politics. It is founded on its own strain of radical indifference in which every person, except the tyrant, is understood as an organism among organisms in an equivalency of Other-Ones.
</blockquote>

<p>
    Contrary to what many might believe, the obliteration of politics is not a good thing. As we discovered a few issues ago (see <a>Legitimacy and Decentralized Systems</a>), politics is how decentralized, democratic systems achieve legitimacy and coherence. Getting rid of politics requires putting everyone and everything in the centralized administrative system of the surveillance capitalist—making them subject to the dictates of the tyrant who has radical indifference to their autonomy, individuality, and humanity.
</p>

<p>
    Zuboff's statement echos David Graeber's discussion of bureaucracy in The Utopia of Rules. Bureaucratic interactions are simple and predictable. But they are soulless. They are transactional and cannot provide the basis for authentic digital relationships (see <a>Authentic Digital Relationships</a> ).
</p>

<blockquote> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00MKZ0QZ2/windleyofente-20">The Utopia of Rules: On Technology, Stupidity, and the Secret Joys of Bureaucracy by David Graeber</a> <p>Where does the desire for endless rules, regulations, and bureaucracy come from? How did we come to spend so much of our time filling out forms? And is it really a cipher for state violence? To answer these questions, the anthropologist David Graeber—one of our most important and provocative thinkers—traces the peculiar and unexpected ways we relate to bureaucracy today, and reveals how it shapes our lives in ways we may not even notice...though he also suggests that there may be something perversely appealing—even romantic—about bureaucracy. </p><p></p></blockquote>

<p>
    Living our lives inside the administrative systems of Big Tech is akin to living your life inside an amusement park. Not altogether unpleasant, but a far cry from authentic. Stippled with moments of joy, but devoid of real happiness and freedom. Treated identically and transactionally despite pretensions to personalization.
</p>

<p>
    In How to Destroy Surveillance Capitalism, Cory Doctorow argues that while Zuboff's observations are not incorrect, her conclusions about what constitutes surveillance capitalism's real dangers are mistaken. Where Zuboff sees companies who are getting better and better at predicting and controlling our actions, Doctorow sees companies selling the power to persuade, poorly. The real harm is the surveillance, not mind control.
</p>

<blockquote> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B08V8Q938Q/windleyofente-20">How to Destroy Surveillance Capitalism by Cory Doctorow</a> <p>For years, we've been hearing about the ills of surveillance capitalism --- the business of extracting, collecting, and selling vast reams of user data that exploded with the rise of tech giants like Google, Facebook, and Amazon. But what if everything we've been hearing is wrong? What if surveillance capitalism is not some rogue capitalism or a wrong turn taken by some misguided corporations? What if the system is working exactly as intended—and the only hope of restoring an open web is to take the fight directly to the system itself? </p><p></p></blockquote>

<p>
    Zuboff's conclusion that surveillance capitalism is a new "rogue" form of capitalism leaves us with little recourse but to regulate the ills that surveillance capitalists bring about. Not unreasonably, Zuboff's prescription for this predicament is to protect, trust, and utilize democratic processes—to collectively push back. To not let our cynicism dissuade us or cause us to lose hope.
</p>

<p>
    But, merely regulating a big monopoly only further entrenches it, locking the world into the status quo. If we want to destroy surveillance capitalism, Cory argues, we have to break it up and decentralize, making "big tech small again." Ultimately, the choice is to fix Big Tech or fix the internet. Cory argues for the second and I'm on board.
</p>

<p>
    Fixing the internet is hard, but not impossible. Cory references Lawrence Lessig, saying "our lives are regulated by four forces: law (what's legal), code (what's technologically possible), norms (what's socially acceptable), and markets (what's profitable)." We can bring all four to bear on this problem.
</p>

<p>
    Antitrust, post Reagan, has lost its teeth and come to focus only on consumer harm instead of other anti-competitive behaviors like buying up large rivals and new competitors. If the problem with "Big Tech" is that it is "big" then restructuring antitrust laws to break up large tech companies is a critical tool.
</p>

<p>
    Many will fear that breaking up big tech will diminish the fruits of the digital world we've come to enjoy, and even rely on. Centralization, they will say, is the only way to safely and efficiently build messaging platforms, app stores, social networks, and other features of Web 2.0 that we've come to enjoy.
</p>

<p>
    This is where Lessig's other three forces come into play. As <a>I've written, in numerous ways</a>, the means exist to decentralize most of the centralized Web 2.0 platforms (i.e. it's "technologically possible" in Lessig's words). The internet itself and more recent decentralized networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum show that large, decentralized systems can achieve legitimacy to accomplish global goals.
</p>

<p>
    Beyond tech, I have hope that norms are changing. People are more aware and wary of the dangers of surveillance and the need for better online privacy. Collecting data is becoming less socially acceptable. Security breeches affect more and more people, waking them up to the problem of companies collecting and holding large caches of personal data. And competitors to big tech with decentralized solutions are always emerging. A little antitrust help could be what it takes to make them viable.
</p>

<p>
    There's no single act that's going to change the way things work now. Getting Congress to act on antitrust requires a big shift in norms. Changing norms requires new technical possibilities, new applications, and, frankly, more privacy problems. Change is predicated on a web of interrelated actions that we must iterate over.
</p>

<p>
    Returning to Zuboff's opening question: "Can the digital future be our home?" Fixing Big Tech just leaves us where we're at, with slightly fewer problems. It's a dead end road that doesn't lead to a digital home. But fixing the internet, redecentralizing it, promises a future where we can live authentic digital lives that compliment our physical lives. I choose to fight for that future.

<p>This article shows how to secure and use different APIs in an ASP.NET Core API which support OAuth access tokens from multiple identity providers. Access tokens from Azure AD and from Auth0 can be be used to access data from the service. Each API only supports a specific token from the specific identity provider. Microsoft.Identity.Web is used to implement the access token authorization for the Azure AD tokens and the default authorization is used to support the Auth0 access tokens.</p>



<p>Code:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/damienbod/SeparatingApisPerSecurityLevel">https://github.com/damienbod/SeparatingApisPerSecurityLevel</a></p>

<p>Setup</p>



<p>An API ASP.NET Core application is created to implement the multiple APIs and accept access tokens created by Auth0 and Azure AD. The access tokens need to be validated and should only work for the intended purpose for which the access token was created. The Azure AD API is used by an ASP.NET Core Razor page application which requests an user access token with the correct scope to access the API. Two Azure AD App registrations are used to define the Azure AD setup. The Auth0 application is implemented using a Blazor server hosted application and accesses the two Auth0 APIs, See the pervious post for details.</p>







<p>To support the multiple identity providers, multiple schemes are used. The Auth0 APIs use the default scheme definition for JWT Bearer tokens and the Azure AD uses a custom named scheme. It does not matter which scheme is used for which as long as the correct scheme is defined on the controller securing the API. The AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApiAuthentication method takes the scheme and the configuration name as a optional parameter. The Azure AD configuration is defined like any standard Azure AD API in ASP.NET Core.</p>


  public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
	// Adds Microsoft Identity platform (AAD v2.0) 
	// support to protect this Api
	services.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApiAuthentication(
		Configuration, "AzureAd", "myADscheme");

	// Auth0 API configuration=&gt; default scheme
	services.AddAuthentication(options =&gt;
	{
		options.DefaultAuthenticateScheme = JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
		options.DefaultChallengeScheme = JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
	}).AddJwtBearer(options =&gt;
	{
		options.Authority = "https://dev-damienbod.eu.auth0.com/";
		options.Audience = "https://auth0-api1";
	});

	services.AddSingleton&lt;IAuthorizationHandler, UserApiScopeHandler&gt;();

	// authorization definitions for the multiple Auth0 tokens
	services.AddAuthorization(policies =&gt;
	{
		policies.AddPolicy("p-user-api-auth0", p =&gt;
		{
			p.Requirements.Add(new UserApiScopeHandlerRequirement());
			// Validate id of application for which the token was created
			p.RequireClaim("azp", "AScjLo16UadTQRIt2Zm1xLHVaEaE1feA");
		});

		policies.AddPolicy("p-service-api-auth0", p =&gt;
		{
			// Validate id of application for which the token was created
			p.RequireClaim("azp", "naWWz6gdxtbQ68Hd2oAehABmmGM9m1zJ");
			p.RequireClaim("gty", "client-credentials");
		});
	});

	services.AddControllers(options =&gt;
	{
		var policy = new AuthorizationPolicyBuilder()
			.RequireAuthenticatedUser()
			.Build();
		options.Filters.Add(new AuthorizeFilter(policy));
	});
}
  


<p>The Configure method uses the UseAuthentication method to add the middleware for the APIs.</p>


  public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, 
	IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
	// ...

	app.UseRouting();

	app.UseAuthentication();
	app.UseAuthorization();

<p>The AzureADUserOneController class is used to implement the API for the Azure AD access tokens. The AuthorizeForScopes attribute from Microsoft.Identity.Web is used to validate the Azure AD App registration access token and define the scheme required for the validation. The scope name must match the Azure App registration definition.</p>


  using System.Collections.Generic;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using Microsoft.Identity.Web;

namespace MyApi.Controllers
{
    [AuthorizeForScopes(Scopes = new string[] { "api://72286b8d-5010-4632-9cea-e69e565a5517/user_impersonation" }, 
        AuthenticationScheme = "myADscheme")]
    [ApiController]
    [Route("api/[controller]")]
    public class AzureADUserOneController : ControllerBase
    {
        private readonly ILogger&lt;UserOneController&gt; _logger;

        public AzureADUserOneController(ILogger&lt;UserOneController&gt; logger)
        {
            _logger = logger;
        }

        [HttpGet]
        public IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; Get()
        {
            return new List&lt;string&gt; { "AzureADUser one data" };
        }
    }
}

  


<p>The UserOneController implements the Auth0 user access token API. Since the default scheme is used, no scheme definition is required. The authorization policy is used to secure the API which validates the scope and the claims for this API.</p>


  using System.Collections.Generic;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;

namespace MyApi.Controllers
{
    [Authorize(Policy = "p-user-api-auth0")]
    [ApiController]
    [Route("api/[controller]")]
    public class UserOneController : ControllerBase
    {
        private readonly ILogger&lt;UserOneController&gt; _logger;

        public UserOneController(ILogger&lt;UserOneController&gt; logger)
        {
            _logger = logger;
        }

        [HttpGet]
        public IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; Get()
        {
            return new List&lt;string&gt; { "user one data" };
        }
    }
}

  


<p>When the API application is started the APIs can be used and a swagger UI implemented using Swashbuckle was created to display the different APIs. Each API will only work with the correct access token. The different UIs can use the APIs and data is returned.</p>

<p>My mother Betty passed away Friday night and her service is Saturday at 2pm at the Kingwood Funeral Home.  This is one of my favorite pictures of her with her mother and my brother David in downtown San Francisco.</p>

<p>Growing up, I always remember that there was a set of golf clubs in the garage but it seemed like they were never used.  Luckily, this week, I listened to a Christmas audio message from 1971 that my parents had sent to my grandparents.  My mom said that the day before, Baxter had taken her to the golf course at Heather Farm and they golfed nine holes.  She said on the first hole, she amused several bystanders trying to get out of the sand trap and they decided to quit keeping score from there.  She said she learned golf was not her sport and would find something else.  She did find tennis.  I was glad to play that sport with her and the family.</p>

<p>The Net Uptime Monitor</p>



<p><br>What it does…</p>



<p><br>Is your internet connection unreliable? You’ve probably called your internet provider’s support line and maybe they were able to help you, maybe they even sent out a tech to look at it. But all too often the response is “Well, it’s working fine now!”</p>



<p><br>The Net Uptime Monitor alerts you to failures in your internet connection and documents the exact time and length of those failures. This failure log will help your provider troubleshoot the problem – after it helps you convince them it’s not your imagination! Net Uptime Monitor is designed to be as simple as possible and accomplish this one purpose accurately and thoroughly with the least effort from you.</p>



<p><br>How it works…</p>



<p><br>Net Uptime Monitor (NUM) uses the “Ping” command to test the response from three public servers operated by Google, Level 3, and OpenDNS. (See “What’s a Ping?” below for an explanation.) Each server is pinged in turn at an interval that you can set – normally five seconds. By default, NUM waits 200 milliseconds (2/10 of a second) for the server to respond – at least 3 times as long as a typical broadband internet connection should take.</p>



<p><br>NUM pings one server at a time; if the server responds, NUM waits the test interval, then pings the next server. If the server doesn’t respond, NUM immediately tries the next server, then the next. If any of the servers respond, then your connection must be working. Only when all three servers fail to respond does NUM determine that your connection is down.</p>



<p><br>By using three servers, NUM ensures that the problem isn’t just with the server or with some connection on the way to that server, or that the server isn’t momentarily slow or congested.</p>



<p><br>NUM can detect failures as short as a couple of seconds in length, but you can decide how long a failure must be before it really counts. A very short failure of a second or so is not likely to affect your use of the net and isn’t of any real concern. You can set how long a failure must be before NUM alerts you to it and records the failure in its failure log.</p>



<p><br>Connection is up, no previous failures…</p>



<p>Connection is down, one previous failure…</p>



<p>The display shows the names and IP addresses of each server. The indicator “light” flashes yellow when the ping is sent and shows green for a successful response. The response time of the last ping is shown. When the response time exceeds the time set for “Wait for Ping Response”, the indicator turns red to show no response from that server.</p>



<p><br>If your connection fails, the current fail length is displayed in red. When the length of the failure exceeds your setting for “Log Failure If Longer Than”, NUM plays an alert sound and writes the failure information into its log.</p>



<p><br>The display also shows the monitored time (how long the monitor has been running), the time since the last logged failure (up time), the start time and length of the last logged failure, and the total count of logged failures since NUM was started. The current settings for the test interval and the minimum failure length to be logged are shown at the bottom of the display.</p>



<p><br>Click the minimize button on the NUM window to hide the display. NUM disappears into your system tray in the “notifications area”. The NUM icon is shown in the notification – you can hover over the icon to see the current time since the last failure (“Up Time”) or click the icon to restore the display. In the Settings, you can choose to have a “failure alert” sound play, and/or have the NUM window “pop up”, if a connection failure longer than your minimum setting occurs.</p>



<p><br>The Log</p>



<p><br>NUM keeps a log of results in a text file. You can view the current log at any time by clicking the “View Log” button. The log is displayed in a separate window. NUM will continue to update the log even while you are viewing it.<br>Because the log is a plain text file, you can open it outside of the NUM program. It will open in Notepad or your default text editor, so you can easily edit or print the log.</p>



<p><br>The log records the start and end time of the monitoring and each failure start time and length. A summary shows the total monitoring time, failure count, total down time, percentage of down time, and the minimum, maximum, and average failure lengths. Here’s an example:</p>



<p>Net Uptime Monitor Failure Log (NetUptimeMonitor.com)<br>Licensed to Example User</p>



<p>=======================================</p>



<p>8/17/2015 8:44:28 AM Log Start</p>



<p>Failure Start Length<br>8/17/2015 1:44:25 PM 0:00:44<br>8/17/2015 1:49:53 PM 0:00:36</p>



<p>8/17/2015 1:52:39 PM 0:01:59</p>



<p>8/18/2015 12:13:17 AM Log End<br>Monitor Duration 15:28:46<br>Failure Summary:<br>Count 3<br>Total Downtime 0:03:20<br>% Downtime 0.36<br>Minimum Length 0:00:36<br>Maximum Length 0:01:59</p>



<p>Average Length 0:01:06</p>



<p>The example shows date and time in US English format; your log will use the format for your region.<br>The log files are saved in a folder of your choice; the default is your Documents folder. You can choose a different folder in the Settings.</p>



<p><br>Also in the Settings, there are two options for the log file:<br>1) New File Each Run<br>A new file is created each time NUM starts. Each log file is named with the date and time NUM was started so that they will appear in your directory in chronological order. The file name is in the form of “NetUptime 20110805 134243.txt”. In this example, the date is August 10, 2015 – 20150810 – and the time is 1:42:43 PM – 134243.<br>2) Add to Existing File<br>Each new log is added to the same single file. The file name is always NetUptime.txt. As long as that file exists in the folder where you have chosen to save the log file, NUM will keep adding to it. If the file doesn’t exist, i.e. it’s been deleted, moved, or renamed, NUM will start a new file.</p>



<p><br>The Settings</p>



<p>Click the “Change Settings” button on the NUM display to open the Settings window. There are several settings available:</p>



<p><br>Startup Settings…</p>



<p><br>· Start when Windows Starts? – Check the box and NUM will automatically start when your computer starts. Uncheck the box and you can start NUM when you want by clicking its desktop icon. The default on installation is checked – NUM starts automatically.<br>· Start Minimized in Tray? – Check the box and NUM will be minimized in the system tray automatically when it starts. The default on installation is unchecked – NUM starts with the main form displayed.<br>Test Settings…<br>· Test Interval – how many seconds between ping tests when the servers are responding. Five seconds is the default. It is possible that NUM will miss a failure that is shorter than the time between tests, so if your connection has very frequent failures of just a few seconds you might choose a shorter test interval. If you don’t have many failures, you may want to test less often. Most connection problems result in less frequent but longer failures, so five seconds is a good choice for most users.<br>· Wait for Ping Response – the length of time NUM waits for a response after sending a ping. The default setting of 200 milliseconds is recommended for normal situations. If you have a slower internet connection, such as a dialup or mobile connection, or are in a remote area where response is typically slow, you can set the wait time for up to 1500 milliseconds (1.5 seconds). To help you find the best setting for your situation, set the wait time to 1500 milliseconds and observe the ping response times NUM displays when your connection is working normally. Set the wait time to about 1.5 times the typical ping response times you see for efficient detection of outages.<br>· Change Target Servers – click to open the Target Servers window.</p>



<p>You can edit the IP Address and Name of any of the three servers. Click the Test button to try that server, verifying that it responds and checking the response time.</p>



<p><br>The default target servers (Google, Level 3, OpenDNS) were selected for their performance and very high reliability. You should only use a different server if you find that one of these servers does not respond reliably in your particular situation. Click “Restore Defaults” to reset the Target Servers to their original values. Changes to the Target Servers take effect the next time the program starts.</p>



<p><br>Alert and Log Settings…</p>



<p><br>· Pop Up on Failure? – Check the box and the NUM form will pop up from the system tray when there is a failure. Uncheck the box and NUM will continue to log and alert but it will stay minimized during a failure. The default on installation is checked – if NUM is minimized to the system tray, the main NUM form will be displayed when a failure is logged.<br>· Alert and Log Failure If Longer Than – the minimum failure length that will be counted, both for the log and the alert of a failure. Five seconds is the default setting.<br>· Log File Location – the folder where the logs will be stored. Click the “Select Folder” button to browse to the folder you want. The log for the current run of NUM is already started, so a change in this setting will not take effect until the next time you run NUM.<br>· Log File Option – New File Each Run (the default) or Add to Existing File. See previous section “The Log” for a more detailed explanation.<br>· Choose Failure Alert Sound – choose the sound NUM makes when a failure is counted. The sound plays when you choose its button so you can preview each one. Choose “None” to silence the alert. Choose “Custom” and click the Select File button to use any .WAV sound file on your system. The default on installation is the “Short” sound.<br>· Play Reconnect Sound – NUM can play a sound when your internet reconnects after a failure. Choose “None” to silence the reconnect sound. Choose “Custom” and click the Select File button to use any .WAV sound file on your system.</p>



<p><br>Combine Settings for “Invisible” Operation</p>



<p><br>NUM can do its job without showing itself or alerting the user to its operation in any way. Choose these settings:<br>· Start when Windows Starts? – checked.<br>· Start Minimized in Tray? – checked.<br>· Pop Up On Failure – unchecked.<br>· Choose Failure Alert Sound – None.<br>· Choose Reconnect Sound – None.<br>With this combination of settings, the user need never be aware of NUM. This is useful in a support situation where you are installing NUM on a computer you aren’t personally using.</p>



<p><br>What’s a Ping?</p>



<p><br>“Ping” is a command available on all kinds of computers that tests whether another computer on the network will respond to your computer. It’s named after the sound of submarine sonar systems – they send out a “ping” sound which bounces off their target and they listen for that echo, locating their target. The internet “ping” works in a similar way. You name your target, an internet server, and “ping” it. The ping command and response looks like this (in a DOS command window):</p>



<p><br>C:\ ping google.com</p>



<p>Pinging google.com [74.125.224.84] with 32 bytes of data:<br>Reply from 74.125.224.84: bytes=32 time=30ms TTL=54<br>Reply from 74.125.224.84: bytes=32 time=31ms TTL=54<br>Reply from 74.125.224.84: bytes=32 time=31ms TTL=54<br>Reply from 74.125.224.84: bytes=32 time=31ms TTL=54</p>



<p>Ping statistics for 74.125.224.84:<br>Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss),<br>Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:<br>Minimum = 30ms, Maximum = 31ms, Average = 30ms</p>



<p>A ping command actually generates four requests and the server replies four times. Each response is timed in thousandths of a second (ms = milliseconds). Here we see that the server at google.com responded in about 31/1000 or 3/100 of a second. The internet is fast! – when everything’s working.</p>



<p><br>Licensing</p>



<p><br>A license for Net Uptime Monitor removes the time limits from the trial version and lets you use the full program on one computer. To purchase a license or register your license, just click “Trial Version – Click to Register or Purchase License” at the bottom of the NUM main form. If you have your license, enter the License Key code you’ve received and click Register. If you need a license, click Purchase a License to visit our web site and make your purchase.<br>If you have already registered your copy of NUM, your name and email are shown on the main form. Click the License Info button to see your license key.</p>



<p><br>Moving to a New Computer or Installing a New Operating System</p>



<p><br>You must unregister your license before you replace your computer or install a new version of Windows. This will make your license key available again to use on your new system. Just click License Info, click Print This Form to make sure you’ll have the license key, then click Unregister License. The program will go back to Trial mode. You can then reuse your license key to register NUM on any computer.</p>

The global pandemic has accelerated our adoption and transformation, and we are in a better place than March 2020. However, sticking with oil, we know that the extraction process has downsides, including carbon release, messy, and difficulty locating economic wells. &nbsp; Amongst data’s most significant downsides are legal liabilities, noise and the wrong data.&nbsp;</p><p>I can easily hide data’s downsides through dashboards.&nbsp; Our dashboards are based on trickle-down KPI and objectives from our strategic plan.&nbsp; We hand out <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Set-SMART-Goals">SMART</a> objectives, but such objectives fundamentally assume that we are and continue to do the right thing.&nbsp; We gather data and post-analysis present it as trending graphs or red, amber, green dashboards, aiming for everything to be going in the right direction or green.&nbsp; Green only means we have no negative variance between our plan and the actual. Organisationally we are incentivised to achieve green at any unknown cost or consequence.&nbsp; Trending analysis can always be generated through the selection of data to fit the story.&nbsp;</p><p>Right now, we are using data to measure, analyse and inform. We have better control of variance across our entire operations and ecosystem than at any previous point in our history. We increasingly have to depend on dashboards to manage the complicated and complex, remain informed, and determine where our energies should be focussed.&nbsp; Without a doubt, this should remain and continue to be improved, but we are already on a diminishing return with the data we collect due to the increase in noise over signal and should aim to cull than add.&nbsp;</p><p>As an agenda item; should we introduce the colour BLUE into our reporting, trends, and dashboards to reduce reporting and data?&nbsp; The traditional traffic lights remain the same; blue is not replacing any of them; it can become the one that allows us to know we are doing the right thing and not just doing the wrong thing that is in the plan in the most efficient and effective way (can be green or red).</p><p>As a team, we have to feed our sense of enquiry, and our existing data gathering, analysis, and reporting do not value the complexity we are faced with. More data does not solve complexity. Data has allowed us to evolve from finance data as the most critical decision-making source to become more sensitive.&nbsp; Whilst we have far more data, it is still narrow, and we should consider how we prepare for the next evolution, which will not be more of the same data.&nbsp; Following on from customer data and the start in ESG, the next data set we are being mandated to report on is <a href="https://www.chieflearningofficer.com/2020/11/05/the-sec-just-mandated-human-capital-disclosure-what-does-this-mean-for-you/">Human Capital.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Human capital reporting opens up our ability to sense what our employees and ecosystem are sensing, seeing and implying; helping us to determine, using technologies such as sentiment analysis, if we are doing the right thing. Where are issues that are not on the dashboard are occurring? What, as yet, unidentified tensions and conflicts are created by our current trickle-down objective/ incentive system? However, as you can imagine, big brother, privacy, and trust are foundational issues we need to discuss front up before this next evolutionary step hits us.&nbsp; This next phase of our data journey means we will find it harder to hide in the selection of data for trends and dashboards or just seek the right trend or green. This is more data, but different data and it will fill a gap in our knowledge,&nbsp; meaning we will be better informed about complex decisions.&nbsp;</p><p>I would like to present for 15 minutes on this topic and host a 45-minute debate with your approval.</p><p>Your CDO</p> <br>

<p>This article shows how use verifiable credentials stored on a digital wallet to verify a digital identity and use in an application. For this to work, a trust needs to exist between the verifiable credential issuer and the application which requires the verifiable credentials to verify. A blockchain decentralized database is used and MATTR is used as a access layer to this ledger and blockchain. The applications are implemented in ASP.NET Core.</p>



<p>The verifier application Bo Insurance is used to implement the verification process and to create a presentation template. The application sends a HTTP post request to create a presentation request using the DID Id from the OIDC credential Issuer, created in the previous article. This DID is created from the National Driving license application which issues verifiable credentials and so a trust needs to exist between the two applications. Once the credentials have been issued to a holder of the verifiable credentials and stored for example in a digital wallet, the issuer is no longer involved in the process. Verifying the credentials only requires the holder and the verifier and the decentralized database which holds the digital identities and documents. The verifier application gets the DID from the ledger and signs the verify request. The request can then be presented as a QR Code. The holder can scan this using a MATTR digital wallet and grant consent to share the credentials with the application. The digital wallet calls the callback API defined in the request presentation body and sends the data to the API. The verifier application hosting the API would need to verify the data and can update the application UI using SignalR to continue the business process with the verified credentials.</p>

<p>Create the presentation template for the Verifiable Credential</p>



<p>A presentation template is required to verify the issued verifiable credentials stored on a digital wallet.</p>



<p>The digital identity (DID) Id of the OIDC credential issuer is all that is required to create a presentation request template.  In the application which issues credentials, ie the NationalDrivingLicense, a Razor page was created to view the DID of the OIDC credential issuer.</p>







<p>The DID can be used to create the presentation template. The MATTR documentation is really good here:</p>



<p><a href="https://learn.mattr.global/tutorials/verify/presentation-request-template">https://learn.mattr.global/tutorials/verify/presentation-request-template</a></p>



<p>A Razor page was created to start this task from the UI. This would normally require authentication as this is an administrator task from the application requesting the verified credentials. The code behind the Razor page takes the DID request parameter and calls the MattrPresentationTemplateService to create the presentation template and present this id a database.</p>


  public class CreatePresentationTemplateModel : PageModel
{
	private readonly MattrPresentationTemplateService _mattrVerifyService;
	public bool CreatingPresentationTemplate { get; set; } = true;
	public string TemplateId { get; set; }

	[BindProperty]
	public PresentationTemplate PresentationTemplate { get; set; }
	public CreatePresentationTemplateModel(MattrPresentationTemplateService mattrVerifyService)
	{
		_mattrVerifyService = mattrVerifyService;
	}
	public void OnGet()
	{

<p>The MattrPresentationTemplateService is used to create the MATTR presentation template. This class uses the MATTR API and sends a HTTP post request with the DID Id of the OIDC credential issuer and creates a presentation template. The service saves the returned payload to a database and returns the template ID as the result. The template ID is required to verify the verifiable credentials.</p>



<p>The MattrTokenApiService is used to request an API token for the MATTR API using the credential of your MATTR account. This service has a simple token cache and only requests new access tokens when no token exists or the token has expired.</p>



<p>The BoInsuranceDbService service is used to access the SQL database using Entity Framework Core. This provides simple methods to persist or select the data as required. </p>


  private readonly IHttpClientFactory _clientFactory;
private readonly MattrTokenApiService _mattrTokenApiService;
private readonly BoInsuranceDbService _boInsuranceDbService;
private readonly MattrConfiguration _mattrConfiguration;

public MattrPresentationTemplateService(IHttpClientFactory clientFactory,
	IOptions&lt;MattrConfiguration&gt; mattrConfiguration,
	MattrTokenApiService mattrTokenApiService,
	BoInsuranceDbService boInsuranceDbService)
{
	_clientFactory = clientFactory;
	_mattrTokenApiService = mattrTokenApiService;
	_boInsuranceDbService = boInsuranceDbService;
	_mattrConfiguration = mattrConfiguration.Value;
}

public async Task&lt;string&gt; CreatePresentationTemplateId(string didId)
{
	// create a new one
	var v1PresentationTemplateResponse = await CreateMattrPresentationTemplate(didId);

	// save to db
	var drivingLicensePresentationTemplate = new DrivingLicensePresentationTemplate
	{
		DidId = didId,
		TemplateId = v1PresentationTemplateResponse.Id,
		MattrPresentationTemplateReponse = JsonConvert
			.SerializeObject(v1PresentationTemplateResponse)
	};
	await _boInsuranceDbService
		.CreateDriverLicensePresentationTemplate(drivingLicensePresentationTemplate);

	return v1PresentationTemplateResponse;
}
  


<p>The CreateMattrPresentationTemplate method sends the HTTP Post request like in the MATTR API documentation. Creating the payload for the HTTP post request using the MATTR Open API definitions is a small bit complicated.  This could be improved with a better Open API definition. In our use case, we just want to create the default template for the OIDC credential issuer and so just require the DID Id.  Most of the other properties are fixed values, see the MATTR API docs for more information.</p>


  private async Task&lt;V1_PresentationTemplateResponse&gt; CreateMattrPresentationTemplate(
	HttpClient client, string didId)
{
	// create presentation, post to presentations templates api
	// https://learn.mattr.global/tutorials/verify/presentation-request-template

	var payloadJson = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(payload);

	var uri = new Uri(createPresentationsTemplatesUrl);

	using (var content = new StringContentWithoutCharset(payloadJson, "application/json"))
	{
		var presentationTemplateResponse = await client.PostAsync(uri, content);

		if (presentationTemplateResponse.StatusCode == System.Net.HttpStatusCode.Created)
		{

			var v1PresentationTemplateResponse = JsonConvert
					.DeserializeObject&lt;MattrOpenApiClient.V1_PresentationTemplateResponse&gt;(
					await presentationTemplateResponse.Content.ReadAsStringAsync());

		}

		var error = await presentationTemplateResponse.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();

	}

	throw new Exception("whoops something went wrong");
}
  


<p>The application can be started and the presentation template can be created. The ID is returned back to the UI for the next step.</p>







<p>Verify the verifiable credentials</p>



<p>Now that a template exists to request the verifiable data from the holder of the data which is normally stored in a digital wallet, the verifier application can create and start a verification process. A post request is sent to the MATTR APIs which creates a presentation request using a DID ID and the required template. The application can request the DID from the OIDC credential issuer. The request is signed using the correct key from the DID and the request is published in the UI as a QR Code. A digital wallet is used to scan the code and the user of the wallet can grant consent to share the personal data. The wallet sends a HTTP post request to the callback API. This API handles the request, would validate the data and updates the UI using SignalR to move to the next step of the business process using the verified data.</p>







<p>Step 1 Invoke a presentation request</p>



<p>The InvokePresentationRequest method implements the presentation request. This method requires the DID Id of the OIDC credential issuer which will by used to get the data from the holder of the data. The template ID is also required from the template created above. A challenge is also used to track the verification. The challenge is a random value and is used when the digital wallet calls the API with the verified data. The callback URL is where the data is returned to. This could be unique for every request or anything you want. The payload is created like the docs from the MATTR API defines.  The post request is sent to the MATTR API and a V1_CreatePresentationRequestResponse is returned if all is configured correctly.</p>


  private async Task&lt;V1_CreatePresentationRequestResponse&gt; InvokePresentationRequest(
	HttpClient client,
	string didId,
	string templateId,
	string challenge,
	string callbackUrl)
{
	var createDidUrl = $"https://{_mattrConfiguration.TenantSubdomain}/v1/presentations/requests";

	var payload = new MattrOpenApiClient.V1_CreatePresentationRequestRequest
	{
		Did = didId,
		TemplateId = templateId,
		Challenge = challenge,
		CallbackUrl = new Uri(callbackUrl),
		ExpiresTime = MATTR_EPOCH_EXPIRES_TIME_VERIFIY // Epoch time
	};
	var payloadJson = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(payload);
	var uri = new Uri(createDidUrl);

	using (var content = new StringContentWithoutCharset(payloadJson, "application/json"))
	{
		var response = await client.PostAsync(uri, content);

		if (response.StatusCode == System.Net.HttpStatusCode.Created)
		{
			var v1CreatePresentationRequestResponse = JsonConvert
				.DeserializeObject&lt;V1_CreatePresentationRequestResponse&gt;(
					await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync());

			return v1CreatePresentationRequestResponse;
		}

		var error = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
	}

	return null;
}
  


<p>Step 2 Get the OIDC Issuer DID</p>



<p>The RequestDID method uses the MATTR API to get the DID data from the blochchain for the OIDC credential issuer. Only the DID Id is required.</p>


  private async Task&lt;V1_GetDidResponse&gt; RequestDID(string didId, HttpClient client)
{
	var requestUrl = $"https://{_mattrConfiguration.TenantSubdomain}/core/v1/dids/{didId}";
	var uri = new Uri(requestUrl);

	var didResponse = await client.GetAsync(uri);

	if (didResponse.StatusCode == System.Net.HttpStatusCode.OK)
	{
		var v1CreateDidResponse = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;V1_GetDidResponse&gt;(
				await didResponse.Content.ReadAsStringAsync());

		return v1CreateDidResponse;
	}

	var error = await didResponse.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
	return null;
}
  


<p>Step 3 Sign the request using correct key and display QR Code</p>



<p>To verify data using a digital wallet, the payload must be signed using the correct key. The SignAndEncodePresentationRequestBody uses the DID payload and the request from the presentation request to create the payload to sign. Creating the payload is a big messy due to the OpenAPI definitions created for the MATTR API. A HTTP post request with the payload returns the signed JWT in a payload in a strange data format so we parse this as a string and manually get the JWT payload.</p>


  private async Task&lt;string&gt; SignAndEncodePresentationRequestBody(
	HttpClient client,
	V1_GetDidResponse did,
	V1_CreatePresentationRequestResponse v1CreatePresentationRequestResponse)
{
	var createDidUrl = $"https://{_mattrConfiguration.TenantSubdomain}/v1/messaging/sign";

	object didUrlArray;
	did.DidDocument.AdditionalProperties.TryGetValue("authentication", out didUrlArray);
	var didUrl = didUrlArray.ToString().Split("\"")[1];
	var payload = new MattrOpenApiClient.SignMessageRequest
	{
		DidUrl = didUrl,
		Payload = v1CreatePresentationRequestResponse.Request
	};
	var payloadJson = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(payload);
	var uri = new Uri(createDidUrl);

	using (var content = new StringContentWithoutCharset(payloadJson, "application/json"))
	{
		var response = await client.PostAsync(uri, content);

		if (response.StatusCode == System.Net.HttpStatusCode.OK)
		{
			var result = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
			return result;
		}

		var error = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
	}

	return null;
}
  


<p>The CreateVerifyCallback method uses the presentation request, the get DID and the sign HTTP post requests to create a URL which can be displayed in a UI. The challenge is created using the RNGCryptoServiceProvider class which creates a random string. The access token to access the API is returned from the client credentials OAuth requests or from the in memory cache. The DrivingLicensePresentationVerify class is persisted to a database and the verify URL is returned so that this could be displayed as a QR Code in the UI.</p>

	{

		InvokePresentationResponse = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(invokePresentationResponse),
		Did = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(did),
		SignAndEncodePresentationRequestBody = jws
	};
	await _boInsuranceDbService.CreateDrivingLicensePresentationVerify(drivingLicensePresentationVerify);

	var qrCodeUrl = $"didcomm://https://{_mattrConfiguration.TenantSubdomain}/?request={jws}";

	return (qrCodeUrl, challenge);
}

<p>The CreateVerifierDisplayQrCodeModel is the code behind for the Razor page to request a verification and also display the verify QR Code for the digital wallet to scan. The CallbackUrl can be set from the UI so that this is easier for testing. This callback can be any webhook you want or API. To test the application in local development, I used ngrok. The return URL has to match the proxy which tunnels to you PC, once you start. If the API has no public address when debugging, you will not be able to test locally.</p>

<p>Step 4 Implement the Callback and update the UI using SignalR</p>



<p>After a successful verification in the digital wallet, the wallet sends the verified credentials to the API defined in the presentation request. The API handling this needs to update the correct client UI and continue the business process using the verified data. We use SignalR for this with a single client to client connection. The Signal connections for each connection is associated with a challenge ID, the same Id we used to create the presentation request. Using this, only the correct client will be notified and not all clients broadcasted. The DrivingLicenseCallback takes the body with is specific for the credentials you issued. This is always depending on what you request. The data is saved to a database and the client is informed to continue. We send a message directly to the correct client using the connectionId of the SignalR session created for this challenge.</p>

<p>The SignalR server is configured in the Startup class of the ASP.NET Core application. The path for the hub is defined in the MapHub method.</p>

<p>The Hub implementation requires only one fixed method. The AddChallenge method takes the challenge Id and adds this the an in-memory cache.

<p>The Javascript SignalR client in the browser connects to the SignalR server and registers the connectionId with the challenge ID used for the verification of the verifiable credentials from the holder of the digital wallet. If a client gets a message from that a verify has completed successfully and the callback has been called, it will redirect to the verified page. The client listens to the MattrCallbackSuccess for messages. These messages are sent from the callback controller directly.</p>

<p>Running the  verifier</p>



<p>To test the BoInsurance application locally, which is the verifier application, ngrok is used so that we have a public address for the callback. I install ngrok using npm. Without a license, you can only run your application in http.</p>


  npm install -g ngrok
  


<p>Run the ngrok from the command line using the the URL of the application. I start the ASP.NET Core application at localhost port 5000. </p>


  ngrok http localhost:5000
  


<p>You should be able to copied the ngrok URL and use this in the browser to test the verification.</p>







<p>Once running, a verification can be created and you can scan the QR Code with your digital wallet. Once you grant access to your data, the data is sent to the callback API and the UI will be redirected to the success page.</p>







<p>Notes</p>



<p>MATTR APIs work really well and support some of the flows for digital identities. I plan to try out the zero proof flow next. It is only possible to create verifiable credentials from data from your identity provider using the id_token. To issue credentials, you have to implement your own identity provider and cannot use business data from your application. If you have full control like with Openiddict, IdenityServer4 or Auth0, this is no problem, just more complicated to implement. If you do not control the data in your identity provider, you would need to create a second identity provider to issue credentials. This is part of your business logic then and not just an identity provider. This will always be a problem is using Azure AD or IDPs from large, medium size companies. The quality of the verifiable credentials also depend on how good the OIDC credential issuers are implemented as these are still central databases for these credentials and are still open to all the problems we have today. Decentralized identities have to potential to solve many problems but still have many unsolved problems.  </p>

<p>The <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop</a> continues to be a central nucleus for thoughtful discussion and development of all things related to digital identity. The most recent workshop, which was held in mid-April, was no exception. Despite the lack of in-person interaction due to the ongoing global pandemic, this IIW was as lively as ever, bringing together a diverse set of stakeholders from across the globe to share experiences, swap perspectives, and engage in healthy&nbsp;debates.</p><p>One common theme this year was the continued development and adoption of BBS+ signatures, a type of multi-message cryptographic digital signature that enables selective disclosure of verifiable credentials. We first <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/ZKPs_for_JSON-LD">introduced</a> this technology at IIW30 in April 2020, and have been inspired and delighted by the community’s embrace and contribution to this effort across the board. In the year since, progress has been made in a variety of areas, from standards-level support to independent implementations and advanced feature&nbsp;support.</p><p>We thought we’d take a moment to round up some of the significant developments surrounding BBS+ signatures and highlight a few of the top items to pay attention to going&nbsp;forward.</p><p>Over the past few months, the linked data proofs <a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/jsonld-signatures-bbs">reference implementation</a> of BBS+ published a new release that introduces a variety of improvements in efficiency and security, including formal alignment to the W3C CCG <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/security-vocab/">Security Vocab</a> v3 definitions. In addition, support for JSON-LD BBS+ signatures was added to the <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-http-api/">VC HTTP API</a>, making it possible to test this functionality in an interoperable way with other vendors participating in an open environment.</p><p>An important element in enabling BBS+ signatures is using what’s known as a <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-pairing-friendly-curves-09">pairing-friendly curve</a>; for our purposes we use <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-pairing-friendly-curves-02#section-2.4">BLS12–381</a>. We have seen some promising signs of adoption for this key pair, with multiple Decentralized Identifier (DID) methods — both <a href="https://hackmd.io/@icZC4epNSnqBbYE0hJYseA/S1eUS2BQw">did:indy</a> from <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/">Hyperledger</a> and <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/ion">did:ion</a> from <a href="https://identity.foundation/">DIF</a> — indicating they intend to add or already have support for these keys, allowing BBS+ signatures to be issued across a variety of decentralized networks and ecosystems. This development is possible due to the fact that BBS+ signatures is a ledger-independent approach to selective disclosure, effectively no custom logic or bespoke infrastructure is needed for these digital signatures to be created, used and understood.</p><p>In addition, the Hyperledger Aries project has been hard at work developing interoperable and ledger-agnostic capabilities in open source. The method used to track interop targets within the cohort and ultimately measure conformance against Aries standards is what’s known as an <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0302-aries-interop-profile">Aries Interop Profile (AIP)</a>. A major upcoming update to AIP will add support for additional DID methods, key types and credential formats, as well as introducing Aries support for JSON-LD BBS+ signatures as part of <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/pull/579">AIP 2.0</a>. This will allow Aries-driven credential issuance and presentation protocols to work natively with BBS+ credentials, making that functionality broadly available for those in the Aries community and&nbsp;beyond.</p><p>There have also been a number of exciting developments when it comes to independent implementations of BBS+ signatures. <a href="https://animo.id/">Animo Solutions</a> has recently implemented JSON-LD BBS+ signatures support into the popular open-source codebase <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python">Hyperledger Aries Cloud Agent Python</a> (ACA-Py). In another independent effort, <a href="https://trinsic.id/">Trinsic</a> has contributed an <a href="https://github.com/trinsic-id/ld-proofs-dotnet">implementation</a> of JSON-LD BBS+ credentials which they have demonstrated to be working in tandem with <a href="https://github.com/trinsic-id/didcomm-v2">DIDComm v2</a>, a secure messaging protocol based on DIDs. Implementations such as these help to demonstrate that open standards are transparent, can be understood and verified independently, and can be implemented with separate languages and tech stacks. They also set the groundwork for demonstrating real testing-driven interoperability via mechanisms such as the VC HTTP API and AIP 2.0. We are continuously looking to improve the documentation of these specs and standards so that their implications and nuances can be more broadly understood by builders and developers looking to engage with the technology.</p><p>On the cryptographic side of things, progress is also being made in hardening the existing BBS+ specification as well as expanding BBS+ to support more advanced privacy-preserving features. A significant development in this area is the work of cryptographer Michael Lodder who has been actively conducting research on an enhanced credential revocation mechanism using <a href="https://github.com/mikelodder7/accumulator-rs">cryptographic accumulators</a> with BBS+. This approach presents a promising alternative to existing solutions that allow authoritative issuers to update the status of issued credentials without compromising the privacy of the credential holder or subject who may be presenting the credential. We see this as another application of BBS+ signatures in the context of verifiable credentials that carries a lot of potential in pushing this technology to an even more robust&nbsp;state.</p><p>There was also initial discussion and tacit agreement to create a new cryptography-focused working group at Decentralized Identity Foundation. As the new WG drafts its charter, the first work item of this group will be the <a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/bbs-signatures-spec/">BBS+ Signatures</a> spec which defines the cryptographic scheme known as BBS+ agnostic of its application in areas such as linked data signatures or verifiable credentials. In the future, this WG will likely evolve to include other crypto-related work items from the community.</p><p>This is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the momentum and development building around this technology in the community. We couldn’t be more excited about the future of BBS+ signatures, especially as we gear up to tackle the next set of hard problems in this area including privacy-preserving subject authentication and revocation using cryptographic accumulators. If you’re interested we encourage you to get involved, either by contributing to the <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/ldp-bbs2020">Linked Data Proofs specification</a>, checking out our <a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/bbs-signatures">reference</a> <a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/jsonld-signatures-bbs">implementations</a>, or participating in the new WG at DIF, to name but a few of the many ways to engage with this work. We look forward to doing this retrospective at many IIWs to come, documenting the ever-growing community that continues to champion this technology in dynamic and interesting ways.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/iiw32-bbs-and-beyond-1a41634c15b0">IIW32: BBS+ and beyond</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>There’s a <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-httpbis-message-signatures-04.html">new draft in the HTTP working group</a> that deals with signing HTTP messages of all types. Why is it here, and what does that give&nbsp;us?</p><p>HTTP is irrefutably a fundamental building block of most of today’s software systems. Yet security and identity need to be layered alongside HTTP. The most common of these is simply running the HTTP protocol over an encrypted socket using TLS, resulting in HTTPS. While this is a powerful and important security component, TLS works only my protecting the stream of bits in transit. It does not allow for message-level and application-level security operations. But what if we could sign the messages themselves?</p><p>While it is possible to wrap the body of a request in a cryptographic envelope like <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/jose/charter/">JOSE</a> or <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core2/">XML DSig</a>, such approaches force developers to ignore most of the power and flexibility of HTTP, reducing it to a dumb transport layer. In order to sign a message but keep using HTTP as it stands, with all the verbs and headers and content types that it gives us, we will need a scheme that allows us to add a detached signature to the HTTP message. The cryptographic elements to the message can then be generated and validated separately from the request itself, providing a layered approach.</p><p>There have been numerous attempts at creating detached signature methods for HTTP over the years, one of the most famous being the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-cavage-http-signatures">Cavage draft</a> which itself started as a community-facing version of <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Amazon’s SIGv4</a> method used within AWS. There were several other efforts, and all of them incompatible with each other in one way or another. To address this, the HTTP Working Group in the IETF stepped up and took on the effort of creating an RFC-track standard for HTTP message signatures that could be used across the variety of use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>As of the writing of this post, <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-httpbis-message-signatures-04.html">the specification is at version 04</a>. While it’s not finished yet, it’s recently become a bit more stable and so it’s worth looking at it in greater&nbsp;depth.</p> Normalizing HTTP <p>As it turns out, the hardest part of signing HTTP messages isn’t the signing, it’s the HTTP. HTTP is a messy set of specifications, with pieces that have been built up by many authors over many years in ways that aren’t always that consistent. A recent move towards consistency has been the adoption of <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8941.html">Structured Field Values</a> for HTTP. In short, structured fields allow HTTP headers to house simple, non-recursive data structures with unambiguous parsing and deterministic serialization. These aspects made it perfect for use within the HTTP message signatures specification.</p><p>Previous efforts at HTTP message signing concentrated on creating a signature around HTTP headers, and the current draft is no exception in allowing that. On top of that, the current draft also allows for the definition of specialty fields that contain other pieces of constructed information not found in the headers themselves. These covered components are identified and combined with each other into a signature input string. To this string is added a field that includes all of the input parameters to this signature. For example, let’s say we want to sign parts of this HTTP&nbsp;request:</p> POST /foo?param=value&amp;pet=dog HTTP/1.1<br>Host: example.com<br>Date: Tue, 20 Apr 2021 02:07:55 GMT<br>Content-Type: application/json<br>Digest: SHA-256=X48E9qOokqqrvdts8nOJRJN3OWDUoyWxBf7kbu9DBPE=<br>Content-Length: 18<br><br>{"hello": "world"} <p>We choose the components we want to sign, including the target of the request and a subset of the available headers, and create the following signature input&nbsp;string:</p> @request-target": post /foo?param=value&amp;pet=dog<br>"host": example.com<br>"date": Tue, 20 Apr 2021 02:07:55 GMT<br>"content-type": application/json<br>"digest": SHA-256=X48E9qOokqqrvdts8nOJRJN3OWDUoyWxBf7kbu9DBPE=<br>"content-length": 18<br>"@signature-params": ("@request-target" "host" "date" "content-type"  "digest" "content-length");created=1618884475;keyid="test-key-rsa-pss" <p>With a given HTTP message and a set of input parameters determining which parts of the message are covered with a signature, any party can re-generate this string with a reasonable level of success. Unsigned headers can be added to the message by intermediaries without invalidating the signature, and it’s even possible for an intermediary to add its own signature to the message on the way through — but we’ll get more into that advanced use case in a future post. The result of this is that the signer and verifier will re-create this signature input string independently of each&nbsp;other.</p><p>Now that we have a normalized string to sign, how do we actually sign&nbsp;it?</p> Signing and Verifying Content <p>Once we have the string, it’s a relatively straightforward matter of applying a key and signature function to the string. Any signature method that takes in and bunch of bytes and spits out a different set of bytes is technically feasible&nbsp;here.</p><p>How do the signer and verifier know which algorithm to use on a given method? It turns out that different deployments have drastically different needs in this regard. As a consequence, this is an aspect that is application specific by the specification, with several common methods called&nbsp;out:</p>  The signer and verifier can both be configured to expect only a specific algorithm, or have that algorithm identified by some aspect external to the protocol.  The signer and verifier can identify the key used to do the signing and figure out the signature algorithm based on that. If an application’s using JSON Web Keys, the alg field of the key provides an easy way to identify a signing mechanism.  If the signer and verifier need to signal the algorithm dynamically at runtime, there is an alg field in the signature parameter set itself that points to a new registry.  And if two or more of these methods are applicable to a given message, the answers all have to match, otherwise something fishy is going on and the signature is invalidated.  <p>Given the above signature input string and an RSA-PSS signing method, we end up with the following Base64-encoded bytes as the signature output:</p> NtIKWuXjr4SBEXj97gbick4O95ff378I0CZOa2VnIeEXZ1itzAdqTpSvG91XYrq5CfxCmk8zz1Zg7ZGYD+ngJyVn805r73rh2eFCPO+ZXDs45Is/Ex8srzGC9sfVZfqeEfApRFFe5yXDmANVUwzFWCEnGM6+SJVmWl1/jyEn45qA6Hw+ZDHbrbp6qvD4N0S92jlPyVVEh/SmCwnkeNiBgnbt+E0K5wCFNHPbo4X1Tj406W+bTtnKzaoKxBWKW8aIQ7rg92zqE1oqBRjqtRi5/Q6P5ZYYGGINKzNyV3UjZtxeZNnNJ+MAnWS0mofFqcZHVgSU/1wUzP7MhzOKLca1Yg== <p>This gives us a signed object, and now we need to put that into our HTTP&nbsp;message.</p> Sending Signatures in&nbsp;Messages <p>The HTTP message signature specification defines two new headers to carry the signature, Signature and Signature-Input. Both of these use the Dictionary construct from the HTTP Structured Field Values standard to carry a named signature.</p><p>But first, why two headers? This construct allows us to easily separate the metadata about the signature — how it was made — from the signature value itself. This separation makes parsing simpler and also allows the HTTP message signatures specification to support multiple independent signatures on a given&nbsp;message.</p><p>The Signature-Input header contains all the parameters that went into the creation of the signature, including the list of covered content, identifiers for the key and algorithm, and items like timestamps or other application-specific flags. In fact, this is the same value used as the last line of the signature input string, and so its values are always covered by the signature. The Signature header contains the value of the signature itself as a byte array, encoded in Base64. The signer chooses a name for the signature object and adds both items to the headers. The name has no semantic impact, it just needs to be unique within a given&nbsp;request.</p><p>Let’s say this signature is named sig1. The signer adds both headers to the request above, resulting in the following signed&nbsp;request.</p> POST /foo?param=value&amp;pet=dog HTTP/1.1<br>Host: example.com<br>Date: Tue, 20 Apr 2021 02:07:55 GMT<br>Content-Type: application/json<br>Digest: SHA-256=X48E9qOokqqrvdts8nOJRJN3OWDUoyWxBf7kbu9DBPE=<br>Content-Length: 18<br>Signature-Input: sig1=("host" "date" "content-type");created=1618884475;keyid="test-key-rsa-pss"<br>Signature: sig1=:NtIKWuXjr4SBEXj97gbick4O95ff378I0CZOa2VnIeEXZ1itzAdqTpSvG91XYrq5CfxCmk8zz1Zg7ZGYD+ngJyVn805r73rh2eFCPO+ZXDs45Is/Ex8srzGC9sfVZfqeEfApRFFe5yXDmANVUwzFWCEnGM6+SJVmWl1/jyEn45qA6Hw+ZDHbrbp6qvD4N0S92jlPyVVEh/SmCwnkeNiBgnbt+E0K5wCFNHPbo4X1Tj406W+bTtnKzaoKxBWKW8aIQ7rg92zqE1oqBRjqtRi5/Q6P5ZYYGGINKzNyV3UjZtxeZNnNJ+MAnWS0mofFqcZHVgSU/1wUzP7MhzOKLca1Yg==:  {"hello": "world"} <p>Note that none of the other headers or aspects of the message are modified by the signature process.</p><p>The verifier parses both headers, re-creates the signature input string from the request, and verifies the signature value using the identified key and algorithm. But how does the verifier know that this signature is sufficient for this request, and how does the signer know what to sign in the first&nbsp;place?</p> Applying the Message Signature Specification <p>As discussed above, the signer and verifier need to have a way of figuring out which algorithm and keys are appropriate for a given signed message. In many deployments, this information can be gleaned through context and configuration. For example, a key derivation algorithm based on the tenant identifier in the URL can be used to dereference the key needed for a given call. Or an application identifier passed in the body could point to a record giving both the expected algorithm and allowable key material.</p><p>In addition to defining a predictable way to determine this, an application of the HTTP message signatures specification also needs to define which parts of the message need to be signed. For example, and API might have very different behaviors based on a Content-Type header but not really care about the Content-Encoding. A security protocol like OAuth or GNAP would require signing the Authorization header that contains the access token as well as the @request-target specialty field.</p><p>The HTTP protocol is also designed to allow interception and proxy of requests and responses, with intermediaries fully allowed to alter the message in certain ways. Applications that need to account for such intermediaries can be picky about which headers and components are signed, allowing the signature to survive expected message modifications but protecting against unanticipated changes in&nbsp;transit.</p><p>This fundamentally means that no signature method will ever be perfect for all messages — but that’s ok. The HTTP message signature draft instead leans on flexibility, allowing applications to define how best to apply the signature methods to achieve the security&nbsp;needed.</p> Building the&nbsp;Standard <p>The HTTP message signatures specification is still a long way from being done. It’s taken in a number of different inputs and many years of collective community experience, and that initially resulted in some major churn in the specification’s syntax and structure. <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-httpbis-message-signatures-04.html">As of version 04</a> though, the major surgery seems to be behind us. While there will inevitably be some changes to the parameters, names, and possibly even structures, the core of this is pretty solid. It’s time to start implementing it and testing it out with applications of all stripes, and I invite all of you to join me in doing just&nbsp;that.</p>

     <p>Source: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/wendykimsmith/">Wendy Smith</a>&nbsp; https://www.learninginnovationslab.org/guest-faculty/</p><br><p>The importance of creating or seeing a paradox is that you can understand that the data and facts being presented to you can lead to the recommendation or conclusion being offered, but equally that the same data and facts can equally lead to a different conclusion.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Our problem is that we are not very good at finding flaws in our own arguments, if for no other reason than they support our incentives and beliefs. We tend to take it personally when someone attacks our logic, beliefs or method, even if they are searching for the paradox. Equally, the person you are about to question reacts just like you do.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Searching for the paradox allows you to see the jumps, assumptions and framing in the logic being presented, which lays bare how our thinking and decisions are being manipulated.&nbsp; Often it turns out, others are blinded to see one conclusion, and as a leader and executive, your role is to explore and question the flow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Logical flow decisions often create paradoxes because of an invalid argument, but they are nevertheless valuable in creating a narrative. We see this as a statement or proposition which, despite sound (or apparently sound) reasoning from acceptable premises, leads to a conclusion that seems logically unacceptable or self-contradictory.&nbsp; Finding a paradox in non-logical flow decisions reveals errors in definitions that were assumed to be rigorous. Equally,&nbsp; a paradox can be seen when a seemingly absurd or contradictory statement or proposition, which when investigated, proves to be well-founded or true. &nbsp; What is evident is the need for critical thinking, questions and sensitivity.&nbsp;</p><p>Just because an idea pops into your head during a presentation doesn’t mean it’s true or reasonable. Idea bias is a new skinny belief you have just created, leading you to poor decision making as you have been framed. Often in a meeting, the framing is such that the presenter has set up a story or analogy which you believe in and fail to create new questions about (idea bias); as a way to make the logic jumps needed to justify a story.&nbsp; If you cannot see the paradox, you are in their model, which means you are unlikely to make an unbiased decision.&nbsp; If you can see the paradox you have mastered critical thinking and can use tools to ensure you make decisions that lead to outcomes that you want.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;If you cannot see the paradox, you are in a model.</p><br><p>Decision-making framing itself create paradox’s for us&nbsp;</p>  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevention_paradox">Prevention paradox</a>: For one person to benefit, many people have to change their behaviour — even though they receive no benefit or even suffer, from the change.&nbsp; An assumption about the adoption of a product.</p>  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making_paradox">Decision-making paradox</a>: Picking “the best decision-making method” is a decision problem in itself.

The ASP.NET Core application allows an admin user to create an OIDC credential issuer using the MATTR service. The credentials are displayed in an ASP.NET Core Razor Page web UI as a QR code for the users of the application. The user can use a digital <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/concepts/digital-wallets">wallet</a> form MATTR to scan the QR code, authenticate against an <a href="https://auth0.com/">Auth0</a> identity provider configured for this flow and use the claims from the id token to add the verified credential to the digital wallet. In a follow up post, a second application will then use the verified credentials to allow access to a second business process. </p>

<p>Setup</p>



<p>The solutions involves an MATTR API which handles all the blockchain identity logic.  An ASP.NET Core application is used to create the digital identity and the OIDC credential issuer using the MATTR APIs and also present this as a QR code which can be scanned. An identity provider is required to add the credential properties to the id token. The properties in a verified credential are issued using the claims values from the id token so a specific identity provider is required with every credential issuer using this technic. Part of the business of this solution is adding business claims to the identity provider. A MATTR digital wallet is required to scan the QR code, authenticate against the OIDC provider which in our case is Auth0 and then store the verified credentials to the wallet for later use.</p>







<p>MATTR Setup</p>



<p>You need to register with MATTR and create a new account. MATTR will issue you access to your sandbox domain and you will get access data from them plus a link to support. </p>



<p>Once setup, use the OIDC Bridge tutorial to implement the flow used in this demo. The docs are really good but you need to follow the <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/tutorials/issue/oidc-bridge/issue-oidc">docs</a> exactly. </p>



<p><a href="https://learn.mattr.global/tutorials/issue/oidc-bridge/issue-oidc">https://learn.mattr.global/tutorials/issue/oidc-bridge/issue-oidc</a></p>



<p>Auth0 Setup</p>



<p>A standard trusted web application which supports the code flow is required so that the MATTR digital wallet can authenticate using the identity provider and use the id token values from the claims which are required in the credential. It is important to create a new application which is only used for this because the client secret is required when creating the OIDC credential issuer and is shared with the MATTR platform. It would probably be better to use certificates instead of a shared secret which is persisted in different databases. We also use a second Auth0 application configuration to sign into the web application but this is not required to issue credentials. </p>



<p>In Auth0, rules are used to extend the id token claims. You need to add your claims as required by the MATTR API and your business logic for the credentials you wish to issue.</p>


  function (user, context, callback) {
    const namespace = 'https://--your-tenant--.vii.mattr.global/';
    context.idToken[namespace + 'license_issued_at'] = user.user_metadata.license_issued_at;
    context.idToken[namespace + 'license_type'] = user.user_metadata.license_type;
    context.idToken[namespace + 'name'] = user.user_metadata.name;
    context.idToken[namespace + 'first_name'] = user.user_metadata.first_name;
    context.idToken[namespace + 'date_of_birth'] = user.user_metadata.date_of_birth;
    callback(null, user, context);
}
  


<p>For every user (holder) who should be able to create verifiable credentials, you must add the credential data to the user profile. This is part of the business process with this flow. If you were to implement this for a real application with lots of users, it would probably be better to integrate the identity provider into the solution issuing the credentials and add a UI for editing the user profile data which is used in the credentials. This would be really easy using ASP.NET Core Identity and for example OpenIddict or IdentityServer4. It is important that the user cannot edit this data. This logic is part of the credential issuer logic and not part of the user profile.</p>



<p>After creating a new MATTR OIDC credential issuer, the callback URL needs to be added to the Open ID connect code flow client used for the digital wallet sign in.</p>







<p>Add the URL to the Allowed Callback URLs in the settings of your Auth0 application configuration for the digital wallet.</p>



<p>Implementing the OpenID Connect credentials Issuer application</p>



<p>The ASP.NET Core application is used to create new OIDC credential issuers and also display the QR code for these so that the verifiable credential can be loaded to the digital wallet. The application requires secrets. The data is stored to a database, so that any credential can be added to a wallet at a later date and also so that you can find the credentials you created. The MattrConfiguration is the data and the secrets you received from MATTR for you account access to the API. The Auth0 configuration is the data required to sign in to the application. The Auth0Wallet configuration is the data required to create the OIDC credential issuer so that the digital wallet can authenticate the identity using the Auth0 application. This data is stored in the user secrets during development.</p>


  {
  // use user secrets
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "--your-connection-string--"
  },
  "MattrConfiguration": {
    "Audience": "https://vii.mattr.global",
    "ClientId": "--your-client-id--",
    "ClientSecret": "--your-client-secret--",
    "TenantId": "--your-tenant--",
    "TenantSubdomain": "--your-tenant-sub-domain--",
    "Url": "http://mattr-prod.au.auth0.com/oauth/token"
  },
  "Auth0": {
    "Domain": "--your-auth0-domain",

    "ClientId": "--your--auth0-wallet-client-id--",
    "ClientSecret": "--your-auth0-wallet-client-secret--",
  }
}
  


<p>Accessing the MATTR APIs</p>



<p>The MattrConfiguration DTO is used to fetch the MATTR account data for the API access and to use in the application.</p>


  public class MattrConfiguration
{
	public string Audience { get; set; }
	public string ClientId { get; set; }
	public string ClientSecret { get; set; }
	public string TenantId { get; set; }
	public string TenantSubdomain { get; set; }
	public string Url { get; set; }
}
  


<p>The MattrTokenApiService is used to acquire an access token and used for the MATTR API access. The token is stored to a cache and only fetched if the old one has expired or is not available.</p>


  public class MattrTokenApiService
{
	private readonly ILogger&lt;MattrTokenApiService&gt; _logger;
	private readonly MattrConfiguration _mattrConfiguration;

	private static readonly Object _lock = new Object();
	private IDistributedCache _cache;

	private const int cacheExpirationInDays = 1;

	private class AccessTokenResult
	{
		public string AcessToken { get; set; } = string.Empty;
		public DateTime ExpiresIn { get; set; }
	}

	private class AccessTokenItem
	{
		public string access_token { get; set; } = string.Empty;
		public int expires_in { get; set; }
		public string token_type { get; set; }
		public string scope { get; set; }
	}

	private class MattrCrendentials
	{
		public string audience { get; set; }
		public string client_id { get; set; }
		public string client_secret { get; set; }
		public string grant_type { get; set; } = "client_credentials";
	}

	public MattrTokenApiService(
			IOptions&lt;MattrConfiguration&gt; mattrConfiguration,
			IHttpClientFactory httpClientFactory,
			ILoggerFactory loggerFactory,
			IDistributedCache cache)
	{
		_mattrConfiguration = mattrConfiguration.Value;
		_logger = loggerFactory.CreateLogger&lt;MattrTokenApiService&gt;();
		_cache = cache;
	}

	public async Task&lt;string&gt; GetApiToken(HttpClient client, string api_name)
	{
		var accessToken = GetFromCache(api_name);

		if (accessToken != null)
		{
			if (accessToken.ExpiresIn &gt; DateTime.UtcNow)
			{
				return accessToken.AcessToken;
			}
			else
			{
				// remove  =&gt; NOT Needed for this cache type
			}
		}

		_logger.LogDebug($"GetApiToken new from oauth server for {api_name}");

		// add
		var newAccessToken = await GetApiTokenClient(client);
		AddToCache(api_name, newAccessToken);

		return newAccessToken.AcessToken;
	}

	private async Task&lt;AccessTokenResult&gt; GetApiTokenClient(HttpClient client)
	{
		try
		{
			var payload = new MattrCrendentials
			{
				client_id = _mattrConfiguration.ClientId,
				client_secret = _mattrConfiguration.ClientSecret,
				audience = _mattrConfiguration.Audience
			};

			var authUrl = "https://auth.mattr.global/oauth/token";
			var tokenResponse = await client.PostAsJsonAsync(authUrl, payload);

			if (tokenResponse.StatusCode == System.Net.HttpStatusCode.OK)
			{
				var result = await tokenResponse.Content.ReadFromJsonAsync&lt;AccessTokenItem&gt;();
				DateTime expirationTime = DateTimeOffset.FromUnixTimeSeconds(result.expires_in).DateTime;
				return new AccessTokenResult
				{
					AcessToken = result.access_token,
					ExpiresIn = expirationTime
				};
			}

			_logger.LogError($"tokenResponse.IsError Status code: {tokenResponse.StatusCode}, Error: {tokenResponse.ReasonPhrase}");
			throw new ApplicationException($"Status code: {tokenResponse.StatusCode}, Error: {tokenResponse.ReasonPhrase}");
		}
		catch (Exception e)
		{
			_logger.LogError($"Exception {e}");
			throw new ApplicationException($"Exception {e}");
		}
	}

	private void AddToCache(string key, AccessTokenResult accessTokenItem)
	{
		var options = new DistributedCacheEntryOptions().SetSlidingExpiration(TimeSpan.FromDays(cacheExpirationInDays));

		lock (_lock)
		{
			_cache.SetString(key, JsonConvert.SerializeObject(accessTokenItem), options);
		}
	}

	private AccessTokenResult GetFromCache(string key)
	{
		var item = _cache.GetString(key);
		if (item != null)
		{
			return JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;AccessTokenResult&gt;(item);
		}

		return null;
	}
}
  


<p>Generating the API DTOs using Nswag</p>



<p>The MattrOpenApiClientSevice file was generated using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/getting-started-with-nswag">Nswag</a> and the Open API file provided by MATTR <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/api-ref">here</a>. We only generated the DTOs using this and access the client then using a HttpClient instance. The Open API file used in this solution is deployed in the git repo.</p>



<p>Creating the OIDC credential issuer</p>



<p>The MattrCredentialsService is used to create an OIDC credentials issuer using the MATTR APIs. This is implemented using the CreateCredentialsAndCallback method. The created callback is returned so that it can be displayed in the UI and copied to the specific Auth0 application configuration. </p>


  private readonly IConfiguration _configuration;
private readonly DriverLicenseCredentialsService _driverLicenseService;
private readonly IHttpClientFactory _clientFactory;
private readonly MattrTokenApiService _mattrTokenApiService;
private readonly MattrConfiguration _mattrConfiguration;

public MattrCredentialsService(IConfiguration configuration,
	DriverLicenseCredentialsService driverLicenseService,
	IHttpClientFactory clientFactory,
	IOptions&lt;MattrConfiguration&gt; mattrConfiguration,
	MattrTokenApiService mattrTokenApiService)
{
	_configuration = configuration;
	_driverLicenseService = driverLicenseService;
	_clientFactory = clientFactory;
	_mattrTokenApiService = mattrTokenApiService;
	_mattrConfiguration = mattrConfiguration.Value;
}

public async Task&lt;string&gt; CreateCredentialsAndCallback(string name)
{
	// create a new one
	var driverLicenseCredentials = await CreateMattrDidAndCredentialIssuer();
	driverLicenseCredentials.Name = name;
	await _driverLicenseService.CreateDriverLicense(driverLicenseCredentials);

	var callback = $"https://{_mattrConfiguration.TenantSubdomain}/ext/oidc/v1/issuers/{driverLicenseCredentials.OidcIssuerId}/federated/callback";
	return callback;
}
  


<p>The CreateMattrDidAndCredentialIssuer method implements the different steps described in the MATTR API documentation for this. An access token for the MATTR API is created or retrieved from the cache and DID is created and the id from the DID post response is used to create the OIDC credential issuer.  The DriverLicenseCredentials is returned which is persisted to a database and the callback is created using this object.</p>


  private async Task&lt;DriverLicenseCredentials&gt; CreateMattrDidAndCredentialIssuer()
{
	HttpClient client = _clientFactory.CreateClient();
	var accessToken = await _mattrTokenApiService
		.GetApiToken(client, "mattrAccessToken");
	client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization =
		new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", accessToken);
	client.DefaultRequestHeaders
		.TryAddWithoutValidation("Content-Type", "application/json");

	var did = await CreateMattrDid(client);
	var oidcIssuer = await CreateMattrCredentialIssuer(client, did);

	return new DriverLicenseCredentials
	{
		Name = "not_named",
		Did = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(did),
		OidcIssuer = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(oidcIssuer),
		OidcIssuerId = oidcIssuer.Id
	};
}
  


<p>The CreateMattrDid method creates a new DID as specified by the API. The MattrOptions class is used to create the request object. This is serialized using the StringContentWithoutCharset class due to a bug in the MATTR API validation. I created this class using the blog from <a href="https://gunnarpeipman.com/httpclient-remove-charset/">Gunnar Peipman</a>.</p>


  private async Task&lt;V1_CreateDidResponse&gt; CreateMattrDid(HttpClient client)
{
	// create did , post to dids 
	// https://learn.mattr.global/api-ref/#operation/createDid
	// https://learn.mattr.global/tutorials/dids/use-did/

	var createDidUrl = $"https://{_mattrConfiguration.TenantSubdomain}/core/v1/dids";

	var payload = new MattrOpenApiClient.V1_CreateDidDocument
	{
		Method = MattrOpenApiClient.V1_CreateDidDocumentMethod.Key,
		Options = new MattrOptions()
	};
	var payloadJson = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(payload);
	var uri = new Uri(createDidUrl);

	using (var content = new StringContentWithoutCharset(payloadJson, "application/json"))
	{
		var createDidResponse = await client.PostAsync(uri, content);

		if (createDidResponse.StatusCode == System.Net.HttpStatusCode.Created)
		{
			var v1CreateDidResponse = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;V1_CreateDidResponse&gt;(
					await createDidResponse.Content.ReadAsStringAsync());

			return v1CreateDidResponse;
		}

		var error = await createDidResponse.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
	}

	return null;
}
  


<p>The MattrOptions DTO is used to create a default DID using the key type “ed25519”. See the MATTR API docs for further details.</p>


  public class MattrOptions
{
  /// &lt;summary&gt;
  /// The supported key types for the DIDs are ed25519 and bls12381g2. 
  /// If the keyType is omitted, the default key type that will be used is ed25519.
  /// 
  /// If the keyType in options is set to bls12381g2 a DID will be created with 
  /// a BLS key type which supports BBS+ signatures for issuing ZKP-enabled credentials.
  /// &lt;/summary&gt;
  public string keyType { get; set; } = "ed25519";
}
  


<p>The CreateMattrCredentialIssuer implements the OIDC credential issuer to create the post request. The request properties need to be setup for your credential properties and must match claims from the id token of the Auth0 user profile. This is where the OIDC client for the digital wallet is setup and also where the credential claims are specified. If this is setup up incorrectly, loading the data into your wallet will fail. The HTTP request and the response DTOs are implemented using the Nswag generated classes. </p>


  private async Task&lt;V1_CreateOidcIssuerResponse&gt; CreateMattrCredentialIssuer(HttpClient client, V1_CreateDidResponse did)
        {
            // create vc, post to credentials api
            // https://learn.mattr.global/tutorials/issue/oidc-bridge/setup-issuer

            var createCredentialsUrl = $"https://{_mattrConfiguration.TenantSubdomain}/ext/oidc/v1/issuers";

            var payload = new MattrOpenApiClient.V1_CreateOidcIssuerRequest
            {
                Credential = new Credential
                {
                    IssuerDid = did.Did,
                    Name = "NationalDrivingLicense",
                    Context = new List&lt;Uri&gt; {
                         new Uri( "https://schema.org") // Only this is supported
                    },
                    Type = new List&lt;string&gt; { "nationaldrivinglicense" }
                },
                ClaimMappings = new List&lt;ClaimMappings&gt;
                {
                    new ClaimMappings{ JsonLdTerm="name", OidcClaim=$"https://{_mattrConfiguration.TenantSubdomain}/name"},
                    new ClaimMappings{ JsonLdTerm="firstName", OidcClaim=$"https://{_mattrConfiguration.TenantSubdomain}/first_name"},
                    new ClaimMappings{ JsonLdTerm="licenseType", OidcClaim=$"https://{_mattrConfiguration.TenantSubdomain}/license_type"},
                    new ClaimMappings{ JsonLdTerm="dateOfBirth", OidcClaim=$"https://{_mattrConfiguration.TenantSubdomain}/date_of_birth"},
                    new ClaimMappings{ JsonLdTerm="licenseIssuedAt", OidcClaim=$"https://{_mattrConfiguration.TenantSubdomain}/license_issued_at"}
                },
                FederatedProvider = new FederatedProvider
                {
                    ClientId = _configuration["Auth0Wallet:ClientId"],
                    ClientSecret = _configuration["Auth0Wallet:ClientSecret"],
                    Url = new Uri($"https://{_configuration["Auth0Wallet:Domain"]}"),
                    Scope = new List&lt;string&gt; { "openid", "profile", "email" }
                }
            };

            var payloadJson = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(payload);

            var uri = new Uri(createCredentialsUrl);

            using (var content = new StringContentWithoutCharset(payloadJson, "application/json"))
            {
                var createOidcIssuerResponse = await client.PostAsync(uri, content);

                if (createOidcIssuerResponse.StatusCode == System.Net.HttpStatusCode.Created)
                {
                    var v1CreateOidcIssuerResponse = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;V1_CreateOidcIssuerResponse&gt;(
                            await createOidcIssuerResponse.Content.ReadAsStringAsync());

                    return v1CreateOidcIssuerResponse;
                }

                var error = await createOidcIssuerResponse.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
            }

            throw new Exception("whoops something went wrong");
        }
  


<p>Now the service is completely ready to generate credentials. This can be used in any Blazor UI, Razor page or MVC view in ASP.NET Core. The services are added to the DI in the startup class. The callback method is displayed in the UI if the application successfully creates a new OIDC credential issuer.</p>


  private readonly MattrCredentialsService _mattrCredentialsService;
public bool CreatingDriverLicense { get; set; } = true;
public string Callback { get; set; }

[BindProperty]
public IssuerCredential IssuerCredential { get; set; }
public AdminModel(MattrCredentialsService mattrCredentialsService)
{
	_mattrCredentialsService = mattrCredentialsService;
}
public void OnGet()
{
	IssuerCredential = new IssuerCredential();
}

public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; OnPostAsync()
{
	if (!ModelState.IsValid)
	{
		return Page();
	}

	Callback = await _mattrCredentialsService
		.CreateCredentialsAndCallback(IssuerCredential.CredentialName);
	CreatingDriverLicense = false;
	return Page();
}
}

public class IssuerCredential
{
	[Required]
	public string CredentialName { get; set; }
}
  


<p>Adding credentials you wallet</p>



<p>After the callback method has been added to the Auth0 callback URLs, the credentials can be used to add verifiable credentials to your wallet. This is fairly simple. The Razor Page uses the data from the database and generates an URL using the MATTR specification and the id from the created OIDC credential issuer. The claims from the id token or the profile data is just used to display the data for the user signed into the web application. This is not the same data which is used be the digital wallet. If the same person logs into the digital wallet, then the data is the same. The wallet authenticates the identity separately. </p>

		}

			DriverLicenseMessage = "You have no valid driver license";
		}
	}
}
  


<p>The data is displayed using Bootstrap. If you use a MATTR wallet to scan the QR Code shown underneath, you will be redirected to authenticate against the specified Auth0 application. If you have the claims, you can add verifiable claims to you digital wallet.</p>







<p>Notes</p>



<p>MATTR API has a some problems with its API and a stricter validation would help a lot. But MATTR support is awesome and the team are really helpful and you will end up with a working solution. It would be also awesome if the Open API file could be used without changes to generate a client and the DTOs. It would makes sense, if you could issue credentials data from the data in the credential issuer application and not from the id token of the user profile. I understand that in some use cases, you would like to protect against any wallet taking credentials for other identities, but I as a credential issuer cannot always add my business data to user profiles from the IDP. The security of this solution all depends on the user profile data. If a non authorized person can change this data (in this case, this could be the same user), then incorrect verifiable credentials can be created. </p>



<p>Next step is to create an application to verify and use the verifiable credentials created here.</p>

     <br><p>I know the journey is more important than the destination, but destinations provide an essential point as they mark somewhere to head towards.&nbsp; All journeys start with a single step, and for me, this journey started a little over three years ago. I have spent this past period considering the question, “How do we make Better Decisions.” This question was refined to become “How do we make Better Decisions with data.” This expanded into “How do we make Better Decisions with data and be better ancestors?”&nbsp; My journey can finally see a destination.&nbsp;</p><p>However, I am now facing a more significant challenge.</p><p>Having reached the destination zone, I want to leave a mark, and it's straightforward to imagine planting a flag. The hope is that when the flag is planted some of the team back at home can see that you've reached the final place.&nbsp; In most circumstances, the destination is not in the Line-of-Sight. Therefore you pick up the flag and wave it, hoping that somebody with binoculars can see you waving your destination flag. If someone sees you, they relay it to the others that the advance party or pioneers (risk-takers and general nutters) have reached the destination. In innovation and invention land, you're tempted to stay at the destination, hoping that the others will follow you to the same place. Waiting there means you eventually run out of resources, this being cash or budget. Having run out of resources, you're faced with the reality you have to head back to where everyone else is as nobody is going to follow you to the destination; it is too risky.&nbsp; On arriving back at home, there's a bit of a party and a celebration. You relay your stories about the journey and how wonderful the destination is. &nbsp; After a few hours of partying, everybody heads back to their homes, leaving you wondering how to persuade others to go to the destination as well.</p><p>There are a series of videos on YouTube of a single dancer who starts to dance to music, and over periods of 5-minutes to several hours, the dancing crowd grows until everybody is dancing. Early adopters and supporters join the pioneer, and eventually, they are joined by the followers who make the crowd. (2021 #covid19 note, what is a crowd and what is a party?)</p><p>The next day after your return, everybody gets up and goes around their jobs and business as usual.&nbsp; What is now needed is to convert the excitement of the destination into a language and story that the first supporters and early adopters can relate to and join in. What is tremendously difficult is constructing a straightforward linear narrative and step actions, meaning the crowd can also join in and desire to get to a new destination. (crossing the chasm)&nbsp; For businesses right now, this is the digital transformation, data, circular economy, ESG, climate change, AI, ethics and sustainability.&nbsp; The pioneers have been to the destination, planted the flags, imagined the better fruits, but we have to drop the complexity of the issues and find a better story for us all to get there.</p><p>The journey I have been on for the last few years is understanding how we make better decisions.&nbsp; This means I have had to unpack numerous topics and dependencies deep in the messiness of models and complexity. Unsurprisingly there are only a few who are also motivated about understanding the complexity and philiosphy of better decisions, it is my burden. We are converting what we have found at the destination (how to make better decisions with data and be better ancestors) into a language that fellow supporters and early adopters can engage with and discuss.&nbsp;</p><p>BUT</p><p>I am now desperate for expert support to convert the ideas into straightforward narrative and actions that the crowd in the town can take on board and start their journey, but knowing where they are going has been discovered. My struggle is that I find it hard to dumb down the complex into a tweet as it cannot possibly embrace the complexity. I continually flight myself as I can see the simple is not truly representative. The PhD virologist of 30 years is given 1 minute to explain virus mutation on the news.&nbsp; The simple becomes fodder to the vocal and easily upset in social media land as it is easily misunderstood and taken out of context. I spend more time trying to justify (to myself) why I am using simple concepts to explain complex ideas.</p><p></p><p>Tribe, I need some help.&nbsp; Is there anybody out there (a nod to Pink Floyd) who is willing to spend the time in a small community helping to refine the words, language, stories, ideas and concepts into a straightforward linear narrative that portrays actions and activities, which means we can all take steps on a journey to making Better Decisions? This is not a job it is a vocation. Journeys are so much more fun when we do them together, and the next part of the journey is to do it all together. I'm looking for early adopter and supporters who can share their destinations so that together we can create a better narrative about decision making, governance and oversight.&nbsp;</p><p>Are you willing and able to help form and write a narrative to enable others to come on our journey?</p> <br>

   <p></p><p>In commercial land, the axis of power has tended to rest with the CEO/ CFO relationship. &nbsp; There is always a myriad of other political triangles that lobby and wrestle for power and sway decisions.&nbsp; Given that decisions are increasingly reliant on evidence which is data, the CDO gets dragged into everyone's battles, which are not always in the best interest of the business, customer, ecosystem or society - such are incentive scheme.</p><p>Everyone else in the senior team does not want to recognise is that the data they use as evidence and proof is equally supportive or detrimental to everyone else's cause.&nbsp; Whilst everyone else on the leadership team gets to pick and bias what they foreground and promote, the CDO has to keep their mind open and judge all data with the same level of critical thinking.&nbsp; This tends to mean the CDO becomes the punch bag when data either supports or otherwise a decision, which in reality is a political lobby for power which the data may not fully support. However, we are all fallible, and data is not the evidence we want it to be.&nbsp;</p><p>we are all fallible, and data is not the evidence we want it to be.&nbsp;</p><p>Given that even the most highly skilled data scientists, who were incentivised to come to the most accurate results, can create a broad range of conclusions, even when given the same data and hypothesis.&nbsp; This means that senior leadership teams don’t know if the data they have and the conclusion they have reached is correct.&nbsp;</p><p>A recent and significant published <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/metaarxiv/cd5j9/">paper</a> gave 73 teams the same data and research question. The answers varied widely, and very little variation was easily explained. What the paper goes on to say is that competencies and potential confirmation biases do not explain the broad variation in outcomes.&nbsp;</p><br><p></p><br><p>The paper concludes that if any given study had been conducted by a different (set of) researcher(s), perhaps even the same researchers at a different time, its results may well have varied for reasons that cannot be reduced to easily observable analytical choices or biases.&nbsp; They conclude that steps in the research process remain undisclosed in the standard presentation and consumption of scientific results and have exposed a “hidden universe” of idiosyncratic research and researcher variability. An important takeaway here is that the reality of researcher decisions cannot easily be simulated.</p><p>Therefore, there are at least two forces at play in data leading to a recommendation or decision.&nbsp; One, the bias and foregrounding of data outcomes by a member of the leadership team is for a reason. Two. the same data, same tools, the same team can generate more than one recommendation.&nbsp; How to determine what is at play is a modern-day skill the CDO must-have.&nbsp;</p><p>As the CDO, you have to gain the trust of all your senior team and work with them to determine what is incentive biased, desired outcome-driven, seeking support or driven from the data set where there is naturally more than one possible conclusion.&nbsp; In doing this, you have to be capable of assessing the alignment or divergence from others in the team who have come to different conclusions. &nbsp; This becomes more complex if the data set is public, purchased, or gathered from the ecosystem with partners, as others outside of the organisation can create different conclusions. You have to be prepared to justify your reason, rationale and processes. &nbsp; The skill you need to demonstrate is one of consistency in finding a route to align any data conclusions to the company's purpose and agreed strategic goals and not to the forces of lobby. Leave those calls to the CEO knowing the CEO has your back or get out, as being the new corporate punch bag is not fun.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p>Note to the CEO</p><p>Each leadership team member is playing their own game and is looking to the CDO to find and support data for their cause, lobby, decision or budget.&nbsp; This means that the CDO becomes the corporate punch bag and police, taking over from HR. The CDO has to navigate the path of varying conclusions and desired outcomes from the same data set, which are in conflict as they meet individuals agendas. &nbsp; As the CEO, you have to be aware of this and the game your CFO will play.&nbsp; The power axis itself of the CEO/ CFO relationship comes under stress as the CDO can give you more insights into decisions “presented because of incentives and self-interest” than anyone else, but HR will still want to own it.&nbsp; If you alienate the CDO, you will lose that linkage, which is exactly what others want.&nbsp; However, first, check that the CDO has this trust of the team and that your CDO has the capability and capacity to manage this modern-day leadership challenge.&nbsp; If not, it might be time to upgrade your CDO with new skills or find a new version.&nbsp;</p><br><br><br><br>

<p>Today marks an important milestone in the life of the OpenID Foundation and the worldwide digital identity community.  Following <a href="https://openid.net/2021/02/19/resolution-thanking-don-thibeau-for-his-service/">Don Thibeau’s decade of exemplary service to the OpenID Foundation as its Executive Director</a>, today we <a href="https://openid.net/2021/04/28/welcoming-gail-hodges-as-our-new-executive-director/">welcomed Gail Hodges as our new Executive Director</a>.</p>
<p>Don was instrumental in the creation of <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a>, the <a href="https://openidentityexchange.org/">Open Identity Exchange</a>, the <a href="https://openid.net/certification/">OpenID Certification</a> program, the <a href="https://fapi.openid.net/">Financial-grade API (FAPI)</a>, and its ongoing worldwide adoption.  He’s created and nurtured numerous liaison relationships with organizations and initiatives advancing digital identity and user empowerment worldwide.  And thankfully, Don intends to stay active in digital identity and the OpenID Foundation, including supporting Gail in her new role.</p>
<p>Gail’s <a href="https://twitter.com/gailhodges">Twitter</a> motto is “Reinventing identity as a public good”, which I believe will be indicative of the directions in which she’ll help lead the OpenID Foundation.  She has extensive leadership experience in both digital identity and international finance, as described in her <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gail-hodges-26b1b9/">LinkedIn profile</a>.  The board is thrilled to have her on board and looks forward to what we’ll accomplish together in this next exciting chapter of the OpenID Foundation!</p>
<p>I encourage all of you to come meet Gail at the <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/openid-foundation-virtual-workshop-tickets-143831524963">OpenID Foundation Workshop tomorrow</a>, where she’ll introduce herself to the OpenID community.</p>

Open your social media feed and you'll see people either heaping praises
on blockchains, calling them the saviors of humanity, or condemning them
as destroying and burning down the planet …

<p>If there's one thing that's true about the word "blockchain", it's that
these days people have strong opinions about it.
Open your social media feed and you'll see people either heaping praises
on blockchains, calling them the saviors of humanity, or condemning them
as destroying and burning down the planet and making the rich richer
and the poor poorer and generally all the other kinds of fights that
people like to have about capitalism (also a quasi-vague word
occupying some hotly contested mental real estate).</p>
<p>There are good reasons to hold opinions about various aspects of what
are called "blockchains", and I too have some pretty strong opinions
I'll be getting into in a followup article.
The followup article will be about "cryptocurrencies", which many people
also seem to think of as synonymous with "blockchains", but this isn't
particularly true either, but we'll deal with that one then.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, some of the fighting on the internet is kind of
confusing, but even more importantly, kind of confused.
Some of it might be what I call "sportsballing": for whatever reason,
for or against blockchains has become part of your local sportsball
team, and we've all got to be team players or we're gonna let the local
team down already, right?
And the thing about sportsballing is that it's kind of arbitrary and
it kind of isn't, because you might pick a sportsball team because you
did all your research or you might have picked it because that just
happens to be the team in your area or the team your friends like, but
god almighty once you've picked your sportsball team let's actually not
talk against it because that might be giving in to the other side.
But sportsballing kind of isn't arbitrary either because it tends to
be initially connected to real communities of real human beings and
there's usually a deeper cultural web than appears at surface level,
so when you're poking at it, it appears surface-level shallow but
there are some real intricacies beneath the surface.  (But anyway, go
sportsball team.)</p>
<p>But I digress.
There are important issues to discuss, yet people aren't really
discussing them, partly because people mean different things.
"Blockchain" is a strange term that encompasses a wide idea space,
and what people consider or assume essential to it vary just as
widely, and thus when two people are arguing they might not even be
arguing about the same thing.
So let's get to unpacking.</p>
 "Blockchain" as handwaving towards decentralized networks in general 
<p>Years ago I was at a conference about decentralized networked
technology, and I was having a conversation with someone I had just met.
This person was telling me how excited they were about
blockchains... finally we have decentralized network designs, and so
this seems really useful for society!</p>
<p>I paused for a moment and said yes, blockchains can be useful for some
things, though they tend to have significant costs or at least
tradeoffs.  It's good that we also have other decentralized network
technology; for example, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">ActivityPub</a>
standard I was involved in had no blockchains but did rely on the
much older "classic actor model."</p>
<p>"Oh," the other person said, "I didn't know there were other kinds of
decentralized network designs.  I thought that 'blockchain' just meant
'decentralized network technology'."</p>
<p>It was as if a light had turned on and illuminated the room for me.  Oh!
This explained so many conversations I had been having over the years.
Of course... for many people, blockchains like Bitcoin were the first
ever exposure they had (aside from email, which maybe they never gave
much thought to as being decentralized) of something that involved
a decentralized protocol.  So for many people, "blockchain" and
"decentralized technology" are synonyms, if not in technical design,
but in terms of understanding of a space.</p>
<p>Mark S. Miller, who was standing next to me, smiled and gave a very
interesting followup: "There is only one case in which you need a
blockchain, and that is in a decentralized system which needs to
converge on a single order of events, such as a public ledger
dealing with the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-spending#Decentralized_currencies">double spending problem</a>."</p>
<p>Two revelations at once.  It was a good conversation... it was a good
start.
But I think there's more.</p>
 Blockchains are the "cloud" of merkle trees 
<p>As time has gone on, the discourse over blockchains has gotten more
dramatic.  This is partly because what a "blockchain" is hasn't been
well defined.</p>
<p>All terminology exists on an ever-present battle between
<a href="https://fossandcrafts.org/episodes/23-nerdout-fuzzy-and-crisp.html">fuzziness and crispness</a>,
with some terms being much clearer than others.
The term "boolean" has a fairly crisp definition in computer science,
but if I ask you to show me your "stove", the device you show me today
may be incomprehensible to someone's definition a few centuries ago,
particularly in that today it might not involve fire.
Trying to define as in terms of its functionality can also cause
confusion: if I asked you to show me a stove, and you showed me a
computer processor or a car engine, I might be fairly confused, even
though technically people enjoy showing off that they can cook eggs on
both of these devices when they get hot enough.
(See also: <a href="https://dustycloud.org/blog/identity-is-a-katamari/">Identity is a Katamari, language is a Katamari explosion</a>.)</p>
<p>Still, some terms are fuzzier than others, and as far as terms go,
"blockchain" is quite fuzzy.
Hence my joke: "Blockchains are the 'cloud' of merkle trees."</p>
<p>This ~joke tends to get a lot of laughs out of a particular kind of
audience, and confused looks from others, so let me explain.
The one thing everyone seems to agree on is that it's a "chain of
blocks", but all that really seems to mean is that it's a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree">merkle tree</a>... really,
just an immutable datastructure where one node points at the parent node
which points at the parent node all the way up.
The joke then is not that this merkle tree runs on a cloud, but that
"cloud computing" means approximately nothing: it's marketing speak for
some vague handwavey set of "other peoples' computers are doing
computation somewhere, possibly on your behalf sometimes."
Therefore, "cloud of merkle trees" refers to the vagueness of the
situation.
(As everyone knows, jokes are funnier when fully explained, so I'll
turn on my "STUDIO LAUGHTER" sign here.)</p>
<p>So, a blockchain is a chain of blocks, ie a merkle tree, and I mean,
technically speaking, that means that <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> is a
blockchain (especially if the commits are signed), but when you see
someone arguing on the internet about whether or not blockchains are
"good" or "bad", they probably weren't thinking about git, which aside
from having a high barrier of entry in its interface and some concerns
about the hashing algorithm used, isn't really something likely to
drag you into an internet flamewar.</p>
 "Blockchain" is to "Bitcoin" what "Roguelike" is to "Rogue" 
<p>These days it's common to see people either heaping praises on
blockchains or criticizing them, and those people tend to be shouting
past one another.
I'll save unpacking that for another post.
In the meanwhile though, it's worth noting that people might not be
talking about the same things.</p>
<p>What isn't in doubt is whether or not
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a>
is a blockchain... trying to understand and then explore the problem
space around Bitcoin is what created the term "blockchain".
It's a bit like the video game genre of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike">roguelikes</a>,
which started with the game
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_%28video_game%29">Rogue</a>,
particularly explored and expanded upon in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetHack">NetHack</a>,
and then suddenly exploding into the indie game scene as a "genre"
of its own.
Except the genre has become fuzzier and fuzzier as people have explored
the surrounding space.
What is essential?
Is a grid based layout essential?
Is a <a href="http://roguetemple.com/z/hyper/">non-euclidean grid</a> acceptable?
Do you have to provide an ascii or ansi art interface so people can play
in their terminals?
Dare we allow unicode characters?
What if we throw out terminals altogether and just play on a grid
of 2d pixelart?
What about 3d art?
What about permadeath?
What about the fantasy theme?
What about random level generation?
What are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike#Key_features">key features</a>
of a roguelike?</p>
<p>Well now we're at the point where I pick up a game like
<a href="https://blazingbeaks.fandom.com/wiki/Blazing_Beaks_Wiki">Blazing Beaks</a>
and it calls itself a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike#Rogue-lites_and_procedural_death_labyrinths">"roguelite"</a>,
which I guess is embracing the point that terminology has gotten extremely
fuzzy... this game feels more like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotron">Robotron</a>
than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_%28video_game%29">Rogue</a>.</p>
<p>So... if "blockchain" is to Bitcoin what "roguelike" is to Rogue, then
what's essential to a blockchain?
Does the blockchain have to be applied to a financial instrument, or
can it be used to store updateable information about eg identity?
Is global consensus required?
Or what about a "trusted quorum" of nodes, such as in Hyperledger?
Is "mining" some kind of asset a key part of the system?
Is proof of work acceptable, or is proof of stake okay?
What about proof of space, proof of space-time, proof of pudding?</p>
<p>On top of all this, some of the terms around blockchains have been
absorbed as if into them.
For instance, I think to many people, "smart contract" means something
like "code which runs on a blockchain" thanks to Ethereum's major
adoption of the term, but the
<a href="http://www.erights.org/">E programming language</a>
described "smart contracts" as the "likely killer app of distributed
capabilities" all the way
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990125095122/http://www.erights.org/">back in 1999</a>,
and was
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990209105758/http://www.best.com/%7Eszabo/smart_contracts_idea.html">borrowing the term</a>
from
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990128165611/http://www.best.com/%7Eszabo/">Nick Szabo</a>,
but really the same folks working on E had described many of those same
ideas in the <a href="https://agoric.com/papers/">Agoric Papers</a> back in 1988.
Bitcoin wasn't even a thing at all until at least 2008, so depending on
how you look at it, "smart contracts" precede "blockchains" by one or
two decades.
So "blockchain" has somehow even rolled up terms outside of its space
as if within it.
(By the way, I don't think anyone has given a good and crisp definition
for "smart contract" either despite some of these people trying to give
me one, so let me give you one that I think is better and embraces its
fuzziness: "Smart contracts allow you to do the kinds of things you
might do with legal contracts, but relying on networked computation
instead of a traditional state-based legal system."
It's too bad more people also don't know about the huge role that Mark
Miller's "split contracts" idea plays into this space because that's
what makes the idea finally makes sense... but that's a conversation
for another time.)
(EDIT: Well, after I wrote this, Kate Sills lent me her
definition, which I think is the best one: "Smart contracts are
credible commitments using technology, and outside a state-provided
legal system."  I like it!)</p>
<p>So anyway, the point of this whole section is to say that kind of like
roguelike, people are thinking of different things as essential to
blockchains.
Everyone roughly agrees on the jumping-off point of ideas but since
not everyone agrees from there, it's good to check in when we're having
the conversation.
Wait, you do/don't like this game because it's a roguelike?
Maybe we should check in on what features you mean.
Likewise for blockchains.
Because if you're blaming blockchains for burning down the planet, more
than likely you're not condemning signed git repositories (or at least,
if you're condemning them, you're probably doing so about it from an
aspect that isn't the fundamental datastructure... probably).</p>
<p>This is an "easier said than done" kind of thing though, because of
course, I'm kind of getting into some "in the weeds" level of details
here... but it's the "in the weeds" where all the substance of the
disagreements really are.
The person you are talking with might not actually even know or consider
the same aspects to be essential that you consider essential though,
so taking some time to ask which things we mean can help us lead to a
more productive conversation sooner.</p>
 "Blockchain" as an identity signal 
<p>First, a digression.
One thing that's kind of curious about the term
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtue_signaling">"virtue signal"</a>
is that in general it tends to be used as a kind of virtue signal.
It's kind of like the word
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipster_%28contemporary_subculture%29">hipster</a>
in the previous decade, which weirdly seemed to be obsessively and
pejoratively used by people who resembled hipsters than anyone else.
Hence I used to make a joke called "hipster recursion", which is that
since hipsters seem more obsessesed with pejorative labeling of
hipsterism than anyone else, there's no way to call someone a "hipster"
without yourself taking on hipster-like traits, and so inevitably
even this conversation is N-levels deep into hipster recursion
for some numerical value of N.</p>
<p>"Virtue signaling" appears similar, but even more ironically so
(which is a pretty amazing feat given how much of hipsterdom seems to
surround a kind of inauthentic irony).
When I hear someone say "virtue signaling" with a kind of sneer, part
of that seems to be acknowledging that other people are sending signals
merely to impress others that they are some kind of the same group but
it seems as if it's being raised as in a
you-know-and-I-know-that-by-me-acknowledging-this-I'm-above-virtue-signaling
kind of way.
Except that by any possible definition of virtue signaling, the above
appears to be a kind of virtue signaling, so now we're into virtue
signaling recursion.</p>
<p>Well, one way to claw our way out of the rabbithole of all this is to
drop the pejorative aspect of it and just acknowledge that signaling
is something that everyone does.
Hence me saying "identity signaling" here.
You can't really escape identity signaling, or even sportsballing, but
you can acknowledge that it's a thing that we all do, and there's a
reason for it: people only have so much time to find out information
about each other, so they're searching for clues that they might align
and that, if they introduce you to their peer group, that you might
align with them as well, without access to a god-like view of the
universe where they know exactly what you think and exactly what
kinds of things you've done and exactly what way you'll behave in
the future or whether or not you share the same values.
(After all, what else is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtue_ethics">virtue ethics</a>
but an ethical framework that takes this in its most condensed form as
its foundation?)
But it's true that at its worst, this seems to result in shallow, quick,
judgmental behavior, usually based on stereotypes of the other side...
which can be unfortunate or unfair to whomever is being talked about.
But also on the flip side, people also do identity signal to each other
because they want to create a sense of community and bonding.
That's what a lot of culture is.
It's worth acknowledging then that this occurs, recognizing its use and
limitations, without pretending that we are above it.</p>
<p>So wow, that's quite a major digression, so now let's get back to
"identity signaling".
There is definitely a lot of identity signaling that tends to happen
around the word "blockchain", for or against.
Around the critiques of the worst of this, I tend to agree: I find much
of the machismo hyper-white-male-privilege that surrounds some of the
"blockchain" space uncomfortable or cringey.</p>
<p>But I also have some close friends who are not male and/or are people
of color and those ones tend to actually suffer the worst of it from
these communities internally, but also seem to find things of value in
them, but particularly seem to feel squeezed externally when the field
is reduced to these kinds of (anti?-)patterns.
There's something sad about that, where I see on the one hand friends
complaining about blockchain from the outside on behalf of people who
on the inside seem to be both struggling internally but then kind of
crushed by being lumped into the same identified problems externally.
This is hardly a unique problem but it's worth highlighting for a moment
I think.</p>
<p>But anyway, I've taken a bunch of time on this, more than I care to,
maybe because (irony again?) I feel that too much of public conversation
is also hyperfocusing on this aspect... whether there's a subculture
around blockchain, whether or not that subculture is good or bad, etc.
There's a lot worthwhile in unpacking this discourse-wise, but some of
the criticisms of blockchains as a technology (to the extent it even
is coherently one) seem to get lumped up into all of this.
It's good to provide thoughtful cultural critique, particularly one
which encourages healthy social change.
And we can't escape identity signaling.
But as someone who's trying to figure out what properties of networked
systems we do and don't want, I feel like I'm trying to navigate the
machine and for whatever reason, my foot keeps getting caught in the
gears here.
Well, maybe that itself is pointing to some architectural mistakes,
but socially architectural ones.
But it's useful to also be able to draw boundaries around it so that
we know where this part of the conversation begins and ends.</p>
 "Blockchain" as "decentralized centralization" (or "decentralized convergence") 
<p>One of the weird things about people having the idea of "blockchains" as
being synonymous with "decentralization" is that it's kind of both very
true and very untrue, depending on what abstraction layer you're
looking at.</p>
<p>For a moment, I'm going to frame this in harsh terms: blockchains are
decentralized centralization.</p>
<p>What?
How dare I!
You'll notice that this section is in harsh contrast to the
"blockchain as handwaving towards decentralized networks in general"
section... well, I am acknowledging the decentralized aspect of it,
but the weird thing about a blockchain is that it's a decentralized
set of nodes converging on (creating a centrality of!) a single
abstract machine.</p>
<p>Contrast with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model#Fundamental_concepts">classic actor model</a>
systems like
<a href="http://erights.org/elib/distrib/captp/index.html">CapTP</a>
in <a href="https://spritelyproject.org/#goblins">Spritely Goblins</a>,
or as less good examples
(because they aren't quite as behavior-oriented as they are
correspondence-oriented, usually)
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">ActivityPub</a>
or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol">SMTP</a>
(ie, email).
All of these systems involve decentralized computation and collaboration
stemming from sending messages to actors (aka "distributed objects").
Of CapTP this is especially clear and extreme: computations happen in
parallel across many collaborating machines (and even better, many
collaborating objects on many collaborating machines), and the behavior
of other machines and their objects is often even opaque to you.
(CapTP survives this in a beautiful way, being able to do well on
anonymous, peer to peer, "mutually suspicious" networks.
But maybe read my
<a href="https://spritelyproject.org/news/what-is-captp.html">rambling thoughts about CapTP</a>
elsewhere.)</p>
<p>While to some degree there are some very
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption">clever</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof">tricks</a>
in the world of cryptography where you may be able to get back some of
the opacity, this tends to be very expensive, adding an expensive
component to the already inescapable additional expenses of a
blockchain.
A multi-party blockchain with some kind of consensus
will always, by definition be slower than a single machine operating
alone.</p>
<p>If you are irritated by this framing: good.
It's probably good to be irritated by it at least once, if you can
recognize the portion of truth in it.
But maybe that needs some unpacking to get there.
It might be better to say "blockchains are decentralized convergence",
but I have some other phrasing that might be helpful.</p>
 "Blockchain" as "a single machine that many people run" 
<p>There's value in having a single abstract machine that many people run.
The most famous source of value is in the "double spending problem".
How do we make sure that when someone has money, they don't spend that
money twice?</p>
<p>Traditional accounting solves this with a linear, sequential ledger,
and it turns out that the right solution boils down to the same thing
in computers.
Emphasis on sequential: in order to make sure money balances out
right, we really do have to be able to order things.</p>
<p>Here's the thing though: the double spending problem was in a sense
solved in terms of single-computers a long time ago in the object
capability security community.
<a href="http://erights.org/elib/capability/ode/index.html">Capability-based Financial Instruments</a>
was written about a decade before blockchains even existed and
showed off how to make a "mint" (kind of like a fiat-currency bank)
that can be implemented in about 25 lines of code in the right
architecture (I've <a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblins/-/blob/4f664218c87fa96432a04d0a107618ec36ab9310/goblins/actor-lib/simple-mint.rkt#L13">ported it to Goblins</a>,
for instance) and yet has both distributed accounts and is robust
against corruption on errors.</p>
<p>However, this seems to be running on a "single-computer based
machine", and again operates like a fiat currency.
Anyone can create their own fiat currency like this, and they are
cheap, cheap, cheap (and fast!) to make.
But it does rely on sequentiality to some degree to operate correctly
(avoiding a class of attacks called "re-entrancy attacks").</p>
<p>But this "single-computer based machine" might bother you for a couple
reasons:</p>
 
 
<p>We might be afraid the server might crash and service will be
  interrupted, or worse yet, we will no longer be able to access our
  accounts.</p>
 
 
<p>Or, even if we could trade these on an open market, and maybe
  diversify our portfolio, maybe we don't want to have to trust a
  single operator or even some appointed team of operators... maybe we
  have a lot of money in one of these systems and we want to be sure
  that it won't suddenly vanish due to corruption.</p>
 
 
<p>Well, if our code operates deterministically, then what if from the
same initial conditions (or saved snapshot of the system) we replay
all input messages to the machine?
Functional programmers know: we'll end up with the same result.</p>
<p>So okay, we might want to be sure this doesn't accidentally get
corrupted, maybe for backup reasons.
So maybe we submit the input messages to two computers, and then
if one crashes, we just continue on with the second one until the
other comes up, and then we can restore the first one from the
progress the second machine made while the first one was down.</p>
<p>Oh hey, this is already technically a blockchain.
Except our trust model is that we implicitly trust both machines.</p>
<p>Hm.
Maybe we're now worried that we might have top-down government
pressure to coerce some behavior on one of our nodes, or maybe we're
worried that someone at a local datacenter is going to flip some bits
to make themselves rich.
So we actually want to spread this abstract machine out over three
countries.
So okay, we do that, and now we set a rule agreeing on what all the
series of input messages are... if two of three nodes agree, that's
good enough.
Oh hey look, we've just invented the "small-quorum-style"
blockchain/ledger!</p>
<p>(And yes, you can wire up <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/goblins/index.html">Goblins</a>
to do just this; a hint as to how is seen in the
<a href="https://dustycloud.org/blog/goblins-time-travel-micropreview/">Terminal Phase time travel demo</a>.
Actually, let's come back to that later.)</p>
<p>Well, okay.
This is probably good enough for a private financial asset, but what
about if we want to make something more... global?
Where nobody is in charge!</p>
<p>Well, we could do that too.
Here's what we do.</p>
 
 
<p>First, we need to prevent a "swarming attack" (okay, this is
  generally called a "sybil attack" in the literature, but for a
  multitude of reasons I won't get into, I don't like that term).
  If a global set of peers are running this single abstract machine,
  we need to make sure there aren't invocations filling up the system
  with garbage, since we all basically have to keep that information
  around.
  Well... this is exactly where those proof-of-foo systems come in
  the first time; in fact Proof of Work's origin is in something
  called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashcash">Hashcash</a> which
  was designed to add "friction" to disincentivize spam for email-like
  systems.
  If we don't do something friction-oriented in this category, our
  ledger is going to be too easily filled with garbage too fast.
  We also need to agree on what the order of messages is, so we
  can use this mechanism in conjuction with a consensus algorithm.</p>
 
 
<p>When are new units of currency issued?
  Well, in our original mint example, the person who set up the mint
  was the one given the authority to make new money out of thin air
  (and they can hand out attenuated versions of that authority to
  others as they see fit).
  But what if instead of handing this capability out to individuals
  we handed it out to anyone who can meet an abstract requirement?
  For instance, in <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/zcap-ld/">zcap-ld</a>
  an invoker can be any kind of entity which is specified with
  <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ld-proofs/">linked data proofs</a>,
  meaning those entities can be something other than a single key...
  for instance, what if we delegated to an abstract invoker that was
  specified as being "whoever can solve the state of the machine's current
  proof-of-work puzzle"?
  Oh my gosh!
  We just took our 25-line mint and extended it for mining-style
  blockchains.
  And the fundamental design still applies!</p>
 
 
<p>With these two adjustments, we've created a "public blockchain" akin
to bitcoin.
And we don't need to use proof-of-work for either technically...
we could swap in different mechanisms of friction / qualification.</p>
<p>If the set of inputs are stored as a merkle tree, then all of the
system types we just looked at are technically blockchains:</p>
 
 
<p>A second machine as failover in a trusted environment</p>
 
 
<p>Three semi-trusted machines with small-scale private consensus</p>
 
 
<p>A public blockchain without global trust, with swarming-attack
   resistance and an interesting abstract capability accessible
   to anyone who can meet the abstract requirement (in this case,
   to issue some new currency).</p>
 
 
<p>The difference for choosing any of the above is really a question of:
"what is your trust/failover requirements?"</p>
 Blockchains as time travel plus convergent inputs 
<p>If this doesn't sound believable to you, that you could create
something like a "public blockchain" on top of something like Goblins
so easily, consider how we might extend
<a href="https://dustycloud.org/blog/goblins-time-travel-micropreview/">time travel in Terminal Phase</a>
to add multiplayer.
As a reminder, here's an image:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now, a secret thing about Terminal Phase is that the gameplay is
deterministic (the random starfield in the background is not, but the
gameplay is) and runs on a fixed frame-rate.
This means that given the same set of keyboard inputs, the game will
always play the same, every time.</p>
<p>Okay, well let's say we wanted to hand some way for someone to replay
our last game.
Chess games can be fully replayed with a very
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess)">condensed syntax</a>,
meaning that merely handing someone a short list of codes they can
precisely replay the same game, every time, deterministically.</p>
<p>Well okay, as a first attempt at thinking this through, what if for
some game of Terminal Phase I played we wrote down each keystroke I
entered on my keyboard, on every tick of the game?
Terminal Phase runs at 30 ticks per second.
So okay, if you replay these, each one at 30 ticks per second, then
yeah, you'd end up with the same gameplay every time.</p>
<p>It would be simple enough for me to encode these as a linked list
(cons, cons, cons!) and hand them to you.
You could descend all the way to the root of the list and start
playing them back up (ie, play the list in reverse order) and you'd
get the same result as I did.
I could even stream new events to you by giving you new items to
tack onto the front of the list, and you could "watch" a game I
was playing live.</p>
<p>So now imagine that you and I want to play Terminal Phase together
now, over the network.
Let's imagine there are two ships, and for simplicity, we're playing
cooperatively.
(The same ideas
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockstep_protocol">can be extended to competitive</a>,
but for narrating how real-time games work it's easier to to start
with a cooperative assumption.)</p>
<p>We could start out by wiring things up on the network so that I am
allowed to press certain keys for player 1 and you are allowed to
press certain keys for player 2.
(Now it's worth noting that a better way to do this doesn't involve
keys on the keyboard but capability references, and really that's
how we'd do things if we were to bring this multiplayer idea live, but
I'm trying to provide a metaphor that's easy to think about without
introducing the complicated sounding kinds of terms like "c-lists" and
"vat turns" that we ocap people seem to like.)
So, as a first attempt, maybe if we were playing on a local area
network or something, we could synchronize at every game tick: I share
my input with you and you share yours, and then and only then do both
of our systems actually input them into that game-tick's inputs.
We'll have achieved a kind of "convergence" as to the current game state
on every tick.
(EDIT: I wrote "a kind of consensus" instead of "a kind of
convergence" originally, and that was an error, because it misleads
on what consensus algorithms tend to do.)</p>
<p>Except this wouldn't work very well if you and I were living far away
from each other and playing over the internet... the lag time for
doing this for every game tick might slow the system to a crawl...
our computers wouldn't get each others' inputs as fast as the game was
moving along, and would have to pause until we received each others'
moves.</p>
<p>So okay, here's what we'll do.
Remember the time-travel GUI above?
As you can see, we're effectively restoring from an old snapshot.
Oh!  So okay.
We could save a snapshot of the game every second, and then both get
each other our inputs to each other as fast as we can, but knowing
it'll lag.
So, without having seen your inputs yet, I could move my ship up and
to the right and fire (and send that I did that to you).
My game would be in a "dirty state"... I haven't actually seen what
you've done yet.
Now suddenly I get the last set of moves you did over the network...
in the last five frames, you move down and to the left and fire.
Now we've got each others' inputs... what our systems can do is
secretly time travel behind the scenes to the last snapshot, then
fast forward, replaying both of our inputs on each tick up until the
latest state where we've both seen each others' moves (but we wouldn't
show the fast forward process, we'd just show the result with the
fast forward having been applied).
This can happen fast enough that I might see your ship jump forward
a little, and maybe your bullet will kill the enemy instead of mine
and the scores shift so that you actually got some points that
for a moment I thought I had, but this can all happen in realtime
and we don't need to slow down the game at all to do it.</p>
<p>Again, all the above can be done, but with actual wiring of
capabilities instead of the keystroke metaphor... and actually, the
same set of ideas can be done with any kind of system, not just
a game.</p>
<p>And oh hey, technically, technically, technically if we both hashed
each of our previous messages in the linked list and signed each one,
then this would qualify as a merkle tree and then this would also
qualify as a blockchain... but wait, this doesn't have anything to do
with cryptocurrencies!
So is it really a blockchain?</p>
 "Blockchain" as synonym for "cryptocurrency" but this is wrong and don't do this one 
<p>By now you've probably gotten the sense that I really was annoyed with
the first section of "blockchain" as a synonym for "decentralization"
(especially because blockchains are decentralized centralization/convergence)
and that is completely true.
But even more annoying to me is the synonym of "blockchain" with
"cryptocurrency".</p>
<p>"Cryptocurrency" means "cryptographically based currency" and it is
NOT synonymous with blockchains.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DigiCash">Digicash</a> precedes blockchains
by a dramatic amount, but it is a cryptocurrency.
The "simple mint" type system also precedes blockchains and while it
can be run on a blockchain, it can also run on a solo
computer/machine.</p>
<p>But as we saw, we could perceive multiplayer Terminal Phase as
technically, technically a blockchain, even though it has nothing to do with
currencies whatsoever.</p>
<p>So again a blockchain is just a single, abstract, sequential machine,
run by multiple parties.
That's it.
It's more general than cryptocurrencies, and it's not exclusive to
implementing them either.
One is a kind of programming-plus-cryptography-use-case
(cryptocurrencies), the other one is a kind of abstracted machine
(blockchains).</p>
<p>So please.
They are frequently combined, but don't treat them as the same thing.</p>
 Blockchains as single abstract machines on a wider network 
<p>One of my favorite talks is Mark Miller's
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXUqfgdDbr8">Programming Secure Smart Contracts</a>
talk.
Admittedly, I like it partly because it well illustrates some of the
low-level problems I've been working on, and that might not be as
useful to everyone else.
But it has this lovely diagram in it:</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is better understood by watching the video, but the abstraction
layers described here are basically as follows:</p>
 
 
<p>"Machines" are the lowest layer of abstraction on the network, but
   there a variety of kinds of machines.
   Public blockchains are one, quorum blockchains are another, solo
   computer machines yet another (and the simplest case, too).
   What's interesting then is that we can see public chains and quorums
   abstractly demonstrated as machines in and of themselves... even though
   they are run by many parties.</p>
 
 
<p>Vats are the next layer of abstraction, these are basically the
   "communicating event loops"... actors/objects live inside them,
   and more or less these things run sequentially.</p>
 
 
<p>Replace "JS ocaps" with "language ocaps" and you can see actors/objects
   in both Javascript and Spritely living here.</p>
 
 
<p>Finally, at the top are "erights" and "smart contracts", which feed
   into each other... "erights" are "exclusive electronic rights", and
   "smart contracts" are generally patterns of cooperation involving
   achieving mutual goals despite suspicion, generally involving the
   trading of these erights things (but not necessarily).</p>
 
 
<p>Okay, well cool!
This finally explains the worldview I see blockchains on.
And we can see a few curious things:</p>
 
 
<p>The "public chain" and "quorum" kinds of machines still boil down
   to a single, sequential abstract machine.</p>
 
 
<p>Object connections exist between the machines... ocap security.
   No matter whether it's run by a single computer or multiple.</p>
 
 
<p>Public blockchains, quorum blockchains, solo-computer machines
   all talk to each other, and communicate between object references
   on each other.</p>
 
 
<p>Blockchains are not magical things.
They are abstracted machines on the network.
Some of them have special rules that let whoever can prove they qualify
for them access some well-known capabilities, but really they're just
abstracted machines.</p>
<p>And here's an observation: you aren't ever going to move all
computation to a single blockchain.
Agoric's CEO, Dean Tribble,
<a href="https://youtu.be/WeRbY6tiAio?t=712">explained beautifully why on a recent podcast</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the problems with Ethereum is it is as tightly coupled as
possible.
The entire world is a single sequence of actions that runs on a
computer with about the power of a cell phone.
Now, that's obviously hugely valuable to be able to do commerce in a
high-integrity fashion, even if you can only share a cell phone's
worth of compute power with the entire rest of the world.
But that's clearly gonna hit a brick wall.
And we've done lots of large-scale distributed systems whether
payments or cyberspace or coordination, and the fundamental model
that covers all of those is
islands of sequential programming in a sea of asynchronous communication.
That is what the internet is about, that's what the interchain is about,
that's what physics requires you to do if you want a system to scale.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Put this way, it should be obvious: are we going to replace the entire
internet with something that has the power of a cell phone?
To ask the question is to know the answer: of course not.
Even when we do admit blockchain'y systems into our system, we're going
to have to have many of them communicating with each other.</p>
<p>Blockchains are just machines that many people/agents run.
That's it.</p>
<p>Some of these are encoded with some nice default programming to do
some useful things, but all of them can be done in non-blockchain
systems because
communicating islands of sequential processes is the generalization.
You might still want a blockchain, ie you might want multiple parties
running one of those machines as a shared abstract machine, but
how you configure that blockchain from there might depend on your
trust and integrity requirements.</p>
 What do I think of blockchains? 
<p>I've covered a wide variety of perspectives of "what is a blockchain"
in this article.</p>
<p>On the worse end of things are the parts involving hand-wavey
confusion about decentralization, mistaken ideas of them being tied to
cryptocurrencies, marketing hype, cultural assumptions, and some real,
but not intrinsic, cultural problems.</p>
<p>In the middle, I am particularly keen on highlighting the similarity
between the term "blockchain" and the term "roguelike", how both of
them might boil down to some key ideas or not, but more importantly
they're both a rough family of ideas that diverge from one highly
influential source (Bitcoin and Rogue respectively).
This is also the source of much of the "shouting past each other",
because many people are referring to different components that they
view as essential or inessential.
Many of these pieces may be useful or harmful in isolation, in small
amounts, in large amounts, but much of the arguing (and posturing)
involves highlighting different things.</p>
<p>On the better end of things is a revelation, that blockchains are just
another way of abstracting a computer so that multiple parties can run
it.
The particular decisions and use cases layered on top of this
fundamental design are highly variant.</p>
<p>Having made the waters clear again, we could muddy them.
A friend once tried to convince me that all computers are
technically blockchains, that blockchains are the generalization of
computing, and the case of a solo computer is merely one where a
blockchain is run only by one party and no transaction history or old
state is kept around.
Maybe, but I don't think this is very useful.
You can go in either direction, and I think the time travel and
Terminal Phase section maybe makes that clear to me, but I'm not so
sure how it lands with others I suppose.
But a term tends to be useful in terms of what it introduces, and
calling everything a blockchain seems to make the term even less
useful than it already is.
While a blockchain could be one or more parties running a sequential
machine as the generalization, I suggest we stick to two or more.</p>
<p>Blockchains are not magic pixie dust, putting something on a
blockchain does not make it work better or more
decentralized... indeed, what a blockchain really does is converging
(or re-centralizing) a machine from a decentralized set of computers.
And it always does so with some cost, some set of overhead...
but what those costs and overhead are varies depending on what the
configuration decisions are.
Those decisions should always stem from some careful thinking about
what those trust and integrity needs are... one of the more
frustrating things about blockchains being a technology of great
hype and low understanding is that such care is much less common than
it should be.</p>
<p>Having a blockchain, as a convergent machine, can be useful.
But how that abstracted convergent machine is arranged can diverge
dramatically; if we aren't talking about the same choices, we might
shout past each other.
Still, it may be an unfair ask to request that those without a deep
technical background go into technical specifics, and I recognize
that, and in a sense there can be some amount gained from speaking
towards broad-sweeping, fuzzy sets and the patterns they seem to be
carrying.
A gut-sense assertion from a set of loosely observed behaviors can be
a useful starting point.
But to get at the root of what those gut senses actually map to, we
will have to be specific, and we should encourage that specificity
where we can (without being rude about it) and help others see those
components as well.</p>
<p>But ultimately, as convergent machines, blockchains will not operate
alone.
I think the system that will hook them all together
<a href="https://spritelyproject.org/news/what-is-captp.html">should be CapTP</a>.
But no matter the underlying protocol abstraction, blockchains
are just abstract machines on the network.</p>
<p>Having finally disentangled what blockchains are, I think soon I
would like to move onto what cryptocurrencies are.
Knowing that they are not necessarily tied to blockchains opens us
up to considering an ecosystem, even an interoperable and exchangeable
one, of varying cryptographically based financial instruments, and
the different roles and uses they might play.
But that is another post of its own, for whenever I can get to it,
I suppose.</p>
<p>ADDENDUM: After writing this post, I had several conversations
with several blockchain-oriented people.
Each of them roughly seemed to agree that Bitcoin was roughly the
prototypical "blockchain", but each of them also seemed to highlight
different things they thought were "essential" to what a "blockchain"
is: some kinds of consensus algorithms being better than others, that
kinds of social arrangements are enabled, whether transferrable
assets are encoded on the chain, etc.
To start with, I feel like this does confirm some
of the premise of this post, that Bitcoin is the starting point, but
like Rogue and "roguelikes", "blockchains" are an exploration space
stemming from a particular influential technical piece.</p>
<p>However my friend Kate Sills (who also gave me a much better
definition for "smart contracts", added above) highlighted something
that I hadn't talked about much in my article so far, which I do agree
deserves expansion.
Kate said: "I do think there is something huge missing from your
piece.  Bitcoin is amazing because it aligns incentives among actors
who otherwise have no goals in common."</p>
<p>I agree that there's something important here, and this definition of
"blockchain" maybe does explain why while from a computer science
perspective, perhaps signed git trees do resemble blockchains, they
don't seem to fit within the realm of what most people are thinking
about... while git might be a tool used by several people with aligned
incentives, it is not generally itself the layer of
incentive-alignment.</p>

<p>This blog is the script of a talk I did internally at WSO2 in 2015 to inspire the team to build their personal brand. Found this today, buried in my Google Docs, and thought of sharing publicly (unedited), in case if someone finds it&nbsp;helpful!</p><p>Good Morning folks, thanks for joining in — it’s my great pleasure to do this session on ‘My Personal Brand is My Professional Success&nbsp;Story’.</p><p>First of all I must thank Asanka, Zai, Charitha, Usama and the entire marketing team for giving me the opportunity to present on this topic. In first sight, I thought, it’s tough to present on a topic — that I have not consciously focused on — or purposely wanted to achieve myself. Then again, thinking further on the title, I realized whether we like it or not each one of us has a personal&nbsp;brand.</p><a href="https://miro.medium.com/max/800/1*Yp9bj3XCL0s_fbGWUmGA2g.jpeg">https://miro.medium.com/max/800/1*Yp9bj3XCL0s_fbGWUmGA2g.jpeg</a><p>The personal brand is the image of you, that you cultivate in others’ minds. In other words — that is how — others think about you. This raises a question in all ‘radical’ minds — why we have to care about what others think about us — we do our bit in the way we want, and should we care about personal branding? It is extremely important to find answers to this question, because if we are not convinced of something, we will never do&nbsp;it.</p><p>In my view there are no individuals — there is a bigger, greater team behind each individual. This bigger, greater team includes your parents, siblings, spouse, kids, relations, friends. colleagues and many more. You like it or not, more or less you are a reflection of this team behind you. As we grow up as human beings the team behind us — or the team which influences us, widens up. It would not just include well-wishers, but also haters, competitors and many more. But, still you as an individual is a reflection of this team. Sometimes — or even in most of the cases, the haters could motivate you more than well-wishers. This team also includes people you have never talked to — people you have never seen — people who never exist, like some characters in books. This is the team behind you — at the same time — you like it or not you become a member of a team behind another individual or set of individuals. In other words, you get influenced by a team and then again you influence another set of individuals.</p><p>Let me take a quick example. Everyone knows Mahatma Gandhi. In his own words, Ghandi once said — “Three moderns have left a deep impress on my life and captivated me. Raychandbhai by his living contact; Tolstoy by his book, “The Kingdom of God is within you”; and Ruskin by his “Unto This Last”. That was what influenced him — today there are countless number of individuals who are influenced by&nbsp;Gandhi.</p><p>Arguably, CNBC, in 2014, named Steve Jobs as the most influential person in last 25 years. Thousands of people are influenced by Steve Jobs, at the same time there are many other people who influenced Jobs — Edwin H. Land, who co-founded Polaroid and made a number of significant advancements in the field of photography, is one of them, Jobs used to talk&nbsp;about.</p><p>In short, whether you like it or not, more or less, you get influenced by others and then again you influence others. Now it is a question on how much an impact you want to make on the rest of the world before you die, to make this world a better place than it looks like today.&nbsp;I</p><p>If you want to make a good/positive impact on others, you care about how they think about you. If you cannot build a positive image of you, in their minds, you will find it extremely hard to make a positive impact in their lives. The positive image of you is the reflection of your character. If you have a bad character, it is extremely hard to build a good image out of it, not quite impossible though. But, if your character is good, the positive image is the bonus what you get for it. Personal branding requires, little more than having a good image — you need to learn to express yourself — not to market yourself — but to express yourself. Everyone from the history, who has made a positive impact to the world, have expressed themselves. The way Gandhi took to express himself, is not the same which Steve Jobs&nbsp;picked.</p><p>The rest of the talk from here onwards, is about, how to build a good image and then how to express your character to the rest, to build a positive personal&nbsp;brand.</p><p>In my view, everyone of us, should have a vision for the life. Vision for the life is the one that drives you to the future. The vision for the life is the one that motivates us to wake up every morning. If you don’t have one — start thinking about it from today. Think about, what motivates you to do what you do everyday. Having a good vision is the core in building a great&nbsp;image.</p><p>The vision has to be inspirational — a great vision statement inspires and moves us. It is a motivational force that compels action. You recognize a great vision statement when you find it difficult not to be inspired.</p><p>The vision has to be challenging — the best vision statements challenge us to become better. In this way, a vision statement requires us to stretch ourselves in pursuit of the vision we seek to achieve. The vision is not an ‘easy target’; it is something that if achieved- would represent a sense of pride and fulfillment.</p><p>The vision has to be achievable — vision must not be so far-fetched that is outside of our reach. It must be conceivably possible, though not probable without additional effort.</p><p>When we start working for a company, we get used to spend most of our time working there. If your vision for life does not match with the vision of the company you work for — there could be many conflicts and you won’t be productive. If your vision for life, is to make this world a better place, you cannot work for a company which produces cigarettes or&nbsp;weapons.</p><p>The second most important thing in building a good image, is your integrity. Oprah Winfrey, who is a well-respected TV talk show host, actress, producer and philanthropist, says “Real integrity is doing the right thing, knowing that nobody’s going to know whether you did it or not.”. I don’t think there is a better way of explaining, ‘integrity’ than this. It captures all what it needs to&nbsp;be.</p><p>I have visited and talked with many WSO2 customers over last eight years. We never talk to a customer with an intention of selling a product. First thing we do is listening to them and learn from them, then we all work towards the best solution to the problem they have. Finally we see how WSO2 could fit into the solution. If it is not a perfect fit — we never lie — we identify the gaps — and find a way to move forward by filling those gaps. Most of the time we win the customer at the second stage, when we build the solution for them and in many cases they agree to go ahead with us, even we are not the perfect match for their problem. That is mainly because, the level of integrity we demonstrate as a&nbsp;company.</p><p>No one is perfect — that also implies everyone makes mistakes. A guy with a high level of integrity would never hide mistakes, but rather would accept it, apologize for it and fix it. Never he would lie — never he would say something to one person and something else to another. Mark Twain once said, “If you tell the truth, you don’t have to remember anything.”</p><p>In short, vision for life will drive you to the future, while the integrity is the cornerstone of your personal&nbsp;brand.</p><p>The third most important thing you should do in building a positive image is, to raise yourself against negativity. Do not let negativity kill your productivity, enthusiasm, passion and spirit. People who spread negativity are the people who feel extremely insecure in their current state. They only have complaints — no suggestions. Their feedbacks are negative, not constructive. They see only bad — not a single bit of good. Identifying these type of people are not that hard — first you need to shield yourself from negativity — then you need to protect your team. Even just by keeping silent when hear something negative, you indirectly contributes to spread it over — fix it at that very point. If you are closely following the US presidential election campaign, you might have noticed, Donald Trump, who is the republican front runner at the moment, is being heavily criticized for being silent and not correcting a question raised by someone in his political campaign, where he said — ‘Muslims is a problem and Barack Obama is a Muslim’. Even though Trump is still the frontrunner, his popularity has gone down considerably after these dialogues.</p><p>The fourth most important thing you should do in building a positive image is, when you do something do it to a level where it can make an impact. If you believe something is right, go for it and make it happen. At the end of the day you may fail — but look back and see whether you have contributed to your best — if so, you will never frustrate — no&nbsp;regrets.</p><p>Expressing an idea is important — but representing an idea is much more important. When you represent something you own it. If you want to do something to make an impact, you must own it. You should not be a someone who talks the talk but does not walk the&nbsp;walk.</p><p>Tolerating criticism and accepting constructive feedback, is another key aspect in building a positive image. There are no better sources than criticisms to validate the direction we are heading and to learn. Bill Gates, once said ‘Your most unhappy customers are your greatest source of learning’.</p><p>We discussed so far, the need to build a positive image and how to do it. Next we will focus on how to build a personal brand by expressing yourself. As we discussed before, personal branding requires, little more than having a good image — you need to learn to express yourself — not to market yourself. If you already have a positive image, being little expressive will build you a positive personal brand. If you already have a negative image, being little expressive will build you a negative personal brand. The image you build is a reflection of your character. That includes your role, as a father, son, brother, husband, colleague, friend, mentor, developer, architect and many more. You can build an image as a good father and a bad son — or as a good son and a bad brother — or as a good friend and a bad developer — likewise any combinations. But, more or less, ultimately your true image is how you do overall. You can be the best developer in the company, but then again if you do not understand the value of respecting each other’s religions and cultural values or — in a single word, if you are a racist — your top skills as a developer is worthless.</p><p>You need to pick how you want to impact the world — or how you want the world to see you. Thats your personal brand — and you build it on top of your character or the image. Your overall character is the shelter for your personal brand. If you do not build it right — if you find holes in it — you cannot protect your brand, even from a light shower. That’s why building the right character comes well before building a personal&nbsp;brand.</p><p>In my view, the area you can make the most impact to the world, in its positive direction, is the area that you are most passionate about. If you are extremely worried and angry about child labour — you can be a thought leader in protesting against child labour. If you are extremely worried and angry about human rights violations — you can be a thought leader in protecting human rights. If you are extremely passionate about integration technologies, you can be a thought leader in integration space. If you are extremely passionate about machine learning, you can be a thought leader in machine learning space. If you are passionate about APIs — you can be a thought leader in API space. If you are passionate about Big Data, you can be a thought leader in Big Data space. If you are passionate about Identity and Access Management, you can be a thought leader in Identity and Access Management space. Opportunities are limitless — but remember our ground rules — if you do something — do it to a level where it can make a positive impact. You do not need to worry about being a thought leader, but when you make a good positive impact, you will become a thought leader automatically.</p><p>Once you decide the area where you want to make an impact — the rest depends on how good you as a communicator. Communication is critically important, because, that’s the only way you can reach to your audience. Content marketing is the best way to build a brand and reputation online; when people look for information, they tend to go back to sources that were helpful to them. If you can become a trusted source of information through your content, over time you’ll become collectively known as the expert of your specific field. It’s best to start your own blog and update it on a regular basis — at least weekly. If you do not update regularly you lose your audience. At the start it would be tough — but once you make it a practice, it will start to happen effortlessly. Another key principle I would like to highlight here is the difference between good and great. Most of the time the difference between good and great lies heavily on how you do tiny/little things better. You may spend hours in writing a blog — finding the content — validating the content and getting all in order. But — we are bit lazy to put another more five to ten minutes of effort, to format our blog post, publish it in DZone and other blog aggregators, share it in social media sites — and do little more. This additional ten minutes of effort could easily make your blog post from being a good one to a great one — and also would attract a larger audience.</p><p>Regularly participate in mailing lists related to the subject of your interest is another way of passing your message to the rest of the world. These mailing lists may be within WSO2 or even outside. Look for standard bodies like W3C, IETF, OASIS — and any other communities that share the same interest of yours, and eagerly participate in related discussions. Not just the mailing lists, look for interesting groups in Facebook, LinkedIn, StackOverFlow and wherever possible and make your&nbsp;mark.</p><p>Webinars at WSO2 is another key medium to pass your message to the audience of your interest. If you want to be a thought leader in your product space, then your responsibility does not end at the moment you release the product. You need to come up with a plan for evangelization — and webinars could be extremely helpful.</p><p>At WSO2 you get a massive number of opportunities to build your brand. Your personal brand is important to you as well as, to the company you serve. Few years back, we had a VP of Marketing called Katie Poplin — and I personally got motivated by some of the concepts she put forward. One thing she believed was, in the open source community, brand value of individuals are much higher and trustworthier than that of companies. People used to think, everything a company shares, is part of their marketing propaganda — which may not reflect the real value. But, what individuals share are their first hand experience. Also we had monthly awards for best blogger, best evangelist and the best article. If I remember correctly I won both the best blogger and best evangelist awards in couple of months and it was fun&nbsp;:-).</p><p>Then again don’t just get constrained by the the opportunities you get from WSO2. Always look for what is happening outside. Try to get your articles published in external portals. Also — look for writing books. Writing a book is not hard as it looks to be. First you need to come up with a proposal, with an attractive topic, in your domain of expertise, and then submit it to few publishers. Most of the publishers accept book proposals and if you go to their web sites, you will find everything you need to know, on writing books — go for&nbsp;it!.</p><p>Conferences and meetups are another way to establish yourself as a prominent speaker in the corresponding domain. Then again, getting a speaking opportunity will depend on how better you have done your homework.</p><p>These are only few techniques to build your brand, in the domain you are interested in, on top of your personal image or the character. Building your personal brand is a focused exercise, not just a piece of cake. It’s a journey, not a destination. Once you built it — maintaining it and protecting it is much harder. As we discussed before, your image or the character is the shelter or the shield of your personal brand. If you build your character consciously, that’ll help you in protecting your&nbsp;brand.</p><p>Finally to wrap up, in this session we discussed the importance of brand building, how to build your character and the image, how to build a personal brand under the shelter of your character. Thank you very&nbsp;much.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com/my-personal-brand-is-my-professional-success-story-8460fe351113">My Personal Brand is My Professional Success Story!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com">FACILELOGIN</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

And the costs continue to climb as the drama unfolds with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/04/13/ever-given-seized-egypt/">port authorities and insurers battling over what’s owed to&nbsp;who.</a></p><p>Transmute is a software company — a verifiable credentials as a service company to be exact — and we’ve been focused specifically on the credentials involved in moving steel assets around the globe alongside our <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/interoperability-is-not-a-choice-387d57c6dc32">customers at DHS SVIP and CBP</a> for the last couple years now. Now, there’s no “silver bullet” for mitigating the fiscal impact of the Ever Given on global trade, and ships who arrived the day it got stuck or shortly after certainly faced a tough decision — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/26/business/suez-canal-blocked-ship.html">sail around the Cape of Africa for up to ~$800K [fuel costs alone] + ~26 days to trip or wait it out at an up to $30K per day demurrage expense</a> [without knowing it’d only be stuck for 6 days or ~$180,000].</p><p>So what if you’re a shipping manager and you can make this decision faster? Or, make the call before your ship arrives at the canal? [Some did make this decision, by the way]. What if your goods are stuck on the Ever Given — do you wait it out? Switching suppliers is costly, and you’ve likely got existing contracts in place for much of the cargo. Even if you could fulfill existing contracts and demand on time with a new supplier, what do you do with the delayed cargo expense? What if you’re unsure whether you can sell the duplicate and delayed goods when they reach their originally intended destination?</p><p>Well, verifiable credentials — a special kind of digital document that’s cryptographically provable, timestamped and anchored to an immutable ledger at the very moment in time it’s created — can give companies the kind of data needed to make these sorts of decisions. With use over time for trade data, verifiable credentials build a natural reputation for all the things the trade documents are about: suppliers, products, contracts, ports, regulations, tariffs, time between supply chain handoff points,&nbsp;etc.</p><blockquote>This type of structured data is of such high integrity that supply chain operators can rely on it and feel empowered to make decisions based on&nbsp;it.</blockquote><p>What I’m hoping comes from this global trade disaster is a change in the way supply chain operators make critical decisions. Supply chains of the future will be powered by verifiable credentials, which seamlessly bridge all the data silos that exist today — whether software-created silos or even the paper-based manual, offline&nbsp;silos.</p><p>Today, it’s possible to move from a static, critical chain style of management where we often find ourselves in a reactive position to supply chains that look more like an octopus. High integrity data about suppliers and products enables proactive, dynamic decision making in anticipation of and in real time response to shifts in the market — ultimately capturing more revenue opportunities and mitigating risk at the same&nbsp;time.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/takeaways-from-the-suez-canal-crisis-971f7404b058">Takeaways from the Suez Canal Crisis</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk">Transmute</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>What is IndieAuth? IndieAuth is an extension of OAuth 2.0 that enables an individual website like someone's WordPress, Gitea or OwnCast instance to become its own identity provider. This means you can use your own website to sign in to other websites that support IndieAuth.</p>

<p>You can learn more about the differences between IndieAuth and OAuth by reading <a href="https://aaronparecki.com/2018/07/07/7/oauth-for-the-open-web">OAuth for the Open Web</a>.</p>

 What You'll Need 

<p>You'll need a few tools and libraries to sign users in with IndieAuth.</p>

 
 An HTTP client. 
 A URL parsing library. 
 A hashing library that supports SHA256. 
 A library to find <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tags in HTML. 
 The ability to show an HTML form to the user. 
 

 IndieAuth Flow Summary 

<p>Here is a summary of the steps to let people sign in to your website with IndieAuth. We'll dive deeper into each step later in this post.</p>

 
 Present a sign-in form asking the user to enter their server address. 
 Fetch the URL to discover their IndieAuth server. 
 Redirect them to their IndieAuth server with the details of your sign-in request in the query string. 
 Wait for the user to be redirected back to your website with an authorization code in the query string. 
 Exchange the authorization code for the user's profile information by making an HTTP request to their IndieAuth server. 
 

 Step by Step 

<p>Let's dive into the details of each step of the flow. While this is meant to be an approachable guide to IndieAuth, eventually you'll want to make sure to <a href="https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/">read the spec</a> to make sure you're handling all the edge cases you might encounter properly.</p>

 Show the Sign-In Form 

<p>First you'll need to ask the user to enter their server address. You should show a form with a single HTML field, <code>&lt;input type="url"&gt;</code>. You need to know at least the server name of the user's website.</p>

<p>To improve the user experience, you should <a href="https://aaronparecki.com/2018/06/03/4/url-form-field">add some JavaScript</a> to automatically add the <code>https://</code> scheme if the user doesn't type it in.</p>

<p>The form should submit to a route on your website that will start the flow. Here's a complete example of an IndieAuth sign-in form.</p>

 <code>&lt;form action="/indieauth/start" method="post"&gt;
  &lt;input type="url" name="url" placeholder="example.com"&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;input type="submit" value="Sign In"&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code> 

<p>When the user submits this form, you'll start with the URL they enter and you're ready to begin the IndieAuth flow.</p>

 Discover the IndieAuth Server 

<p>There are potentially two URLs you'll need to find at the URL the user entered in order to complete the flow: the authorization endpoint and token endpoint.</p>

<p>The authorization endpoint is where you'll redirect the user to so they can sign in and approve the request. Eventually they'll be redirected back to your app with an authorization code in the query string. You can take that authorization code and exchange it for their profile information. If your app wanted to read or write additional data from their website, such as when creating posts using <a href="https://micropub.net">Micropub</a>, it could exchange that code at the second endpoint (the token endpoint) to get an access token.</p>

<p>To find these endpoints, you'll fetch the URL the user entered (after <a href="https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/#url-canonicalization">validating and normalizing</a> it first) and look for <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tags on the web page. Specifically, you'll be looking for <code>&lt;link rel="authorization_endpoint" href="..."&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;link rel="token_endpoint" href="..."&gt;</code> to find the endpoints you need for the flow. You'll want to use an HTML parser or a <a href="https://indieweb.org/link_rel_parser">link rel parser</a> library to find these URLs.</p>

 Start the Flow by Redirecting the User 

<p>Now you're ready to send the user to their IndieAuth server to have them log in and approve your request.</p>

<p>You'll need to take the authorization endpoint you discovered in the previous request and add a bunch of parameters to the query string, then redirect the user to that URL. Here is the list of parameters to add to the query string:</p>

 
 <code>response_type=code</code> - This tells the server you are doing an IndieAuth authorization code flow. 
 <code>client_id=</code> - Set this value to the home page of your website the user is signing in to. 
 <code>redirect_uri=</code> - This is the URL where you want the user to be returned to after they log in and approve the request. It should have the same domain name as the <code>client_id</code> value. 
 <code>state=</code> - Before starting this step, you should generate a random value for the <code>state</code> parameter and store it in a session and include it in the request. This is for CSRF protection for your app. 
 <code>code_challenge=</code> - This is the base64-urlencoded SHA256 hash of a random string you will generate. We'll cover this in more detail below. 
 <code>code_challenge_method=S256</code> - This tells the server which hashing method you used, which will be SHA256 or S256 for short. 
 <code>me=</code> - (optional) You can provide the URL the user entered in your sign-in form as a parameter here which can be a hint to some IndieAuth servers that support multiple users per server. 
 <code>scope=profile</code> - (optional) If you want to request the user's profile information such as their name, photo, or email, include the scope parameter in the request. The value of the scope parameter can be either <code>profile</code> or <code>profile email</code>. (Make sure to URL-encode the value when including it in a URL, so it will end up as <code>profile+email</code> or <code>profile%20email</code>.) 
 

<p>Calculating the Code Challenge</p>

<p>The Code Challenge is a hash of a secret (called the Code Verifier) that you generate before redirecting the user. This lets the server know that the thing that will later make the request for the user's profile information is the same thing that started the flow. You can see the full details of how to create this parameter <a href="https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/#authorization-request">in the spec</a>, but the summary is:</p>

 
 Create a random string (called the Code Verifier) between 43-128 characters long 
 Calculate the SHA256 hash of the string 
 Base64-URL encode the hash to create the Code Challenge 
 

<p>The part that people most often make a mistake with is the Base64-URL encoding. Make sure you are encoding the raw hash value, not a hex representation of the hash like some hashing libraries will return.</p>

<p>Once you're ready with all these values, add them all to the query string of the authorization endpoint you previously discovered. For example if the user's authorization endpoint is <code>https://indieauth.rocks/authorize</code> because their website is <code>https://indieauth.rocks</code>, then you'd add these parameters to the query string to create a URL like:</p>

 <code>https://indieauth.rocks/authorize?response_type=code
  &amp;client_id=https://example-app.com
  &amp;redirect_uri=https://example-app.com/redirect
  &amp;state=a46a0b27e67c0cb53
  &amp;code_challenge=eBKnGb9SEoqsi0RGBv00dsvFDzJNQOyomi6LE87RVSc
  &amp;code_challenge_method=S256
  &amp;me=https://indieauth.rocks
  &amp;scope=profile
</code> 

<p>Note: The user's authorization endpoint might not be on the same domain as the URL they entered. That's okay! That just means they have delegated their IndieAuth handling to an external service.</p>

<p>Now you can redirect the user to this URL so that they can approve this request at their own IndieAuth server.</p>

 Handle the Redirect Back 

<p>You won't see the user again until after they've logged in to their website and approved the request. Eventually the IndieAuth server will redirect the user back to the <code>redirect_uri</code> you provided in the authorization request. The authorization server will add two query parameters to the redirect: <code>code</code> and <code>state</code>. For example:</p>

 <code>https://example-app.com/redirect?code=af79b83817b317afc9aa
  &amp;state=a46a0b27e67c0cb53
</code> 

<p>First you need to double check that the <code>state</code> value in the redirect matches the <code>state</code> value that you included in the initial request. This is a CSRF protection mechanism. Assuming they match, you're ready to exchange the authorization code for the user's profile information.</p>

 Exchange the Authorization Code for the User's Profile Info 

<p>Now you'll need to make a POST request to exchange the authorization code for the user's profile information. Since this code was returned in a redirect, the IndieAuth server needs an extra confirmation that it was sent back to the right thing, which is what the Code Verifier and Code Challenge are for. You'll make a POST request to the authorization endpoint with the following parameters:</p>

 
 <code>grant_type=authorization_code</code> 
 <code>code=</code> - The authorization code as received in the redirect. 
 <code>client_id=</code> - The same <code>client_id</code> as was used in the original request. 
 <code>redirect_uri=</code> The same <code>redirect_uri</code> as was used in the original request. 
 <code>code_verifier=</code> The original random string you generated when calculating the Code Challenge. 
 

<p>This is described in additional detail <a href="https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/#redeeming-the-authorization-code">in the spec</a>.</p>

<p>Assuming everything checks out, the IndieAuth server will respond with the full URL of the user, as well as their stated profile information if requested. The response will look like the below:</p>

 <code>{
  "me": "https://indieauth.rocks/",
  "profile": {
    "name": "IndieAuth Rocks",
    "url": https://indieauth.rocks/"
    "photo": "https://indieauth.rocks/profile.jpg"
  }
}
</code> 

<p>Wait! We're not done yet! Just because you get information in this response doesn't necessarily mean you can trust it yet! There are two important points here:</p>

 
 The information under the <code>profile</code> object must ALWAYS be treated as user-supplied data, not treated as canonical or authoritative in any way. This means for example not de-duping users based on the <code>profile.url</code> field or <code>profile.email</code> field. 
 If the <code>me</code> URL is not an exact match of the URL the user initially entered, you need to re-discover the authorization endpoint of the <code>me</code> URL returned in this response and make sure it matches exactly the authorization server you found in the initial discovery step. 
 

<p>You can perform the same discovery step as in the beginning, but this time using the <code>me</code> URL returned in the authorization code response. If that authorization endpoint matches the same authorization endpoint that you used when you started the flow, everything is fine and you can treat this response as valid.</p>

<p>This last validation step is critical, since without it, anyone could set up an authorization endpoint claiming to be anyone else's server. More details are available <a href="https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/#authorization-server-confirmation">in the spec</a>.</p>

<p>Now you're done!</p>

<p>The <code>me</code> URL is the value you should use as the canonical and stable identifier for this user. You can use the information in the <code>profile</code> object to augment this user account with information like the user's name or profile information. If the user logs in again later, look up the user from their <code>me</code> URL and update their name/photo/email with the most recent values in the <code>profile</code> object to keep their profile up to date.</p>

 Testing Your IndieAuth Client 

<p>To test your IndieAuth client, you'll need to find a handful of IndieAuth providers in the wild you can use to sign in to it. Here are some to get you started:</p>

 
 <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> - All micro.blog accounts are IndieAuth identities as well. You can use a free account for testing. 
 <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/indieauth/">WordPress</a> - With the IndieAuth plugin installed, a WordPress site can be its own IndieAuth server as well. 
 <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/indieweb">Drupal</a> - The IndieWeb module for Drupal will let a Drupal instance be its own IndieAuth server. 
 <a href="https://indieweb.org/selfauth">Selfauth</a> - Selfauth is a single PHP file that acts as an IndieAuth server. 
 

<p>Eventually I will get around to finishing the test suite at <a href="https://indieauth.rocks">indieauth.rocks</a> so that you have a testing tool readily available, but in the mean time the options above should be enough to get you started.</p>

However, complex decisions based on experience, gut instinct, leadership and opinions still play a role, but most decisions can now be underpinned with a firmer foundation.  BE curious&nbsp;about how the business operates and makes money and its drivers of cost, revenue, and customer satisfaction through the lens of data and analytical models.  BE an ambassador&nbsp;of change. Data uncovers assumptions that unpack previous political decisions and moves power. Data does not create change but will create conflict — how this is managed is a critical CDO skill.  BE a great storyteller.  KNOW who&nbsp;is the smartest data scientist in the company, where the most sophisticated models are, and understand and appreciate what those data teams do and how they do it. Managing and getting the best from these teams is a skill everyone needs.  FIGURE out&nbsp;and articulate the value your team can deliver to the business in the next week, month, and quarter. As the CDO, what is the value you bring to your peers and shareholder in the next 5 years?  IMPROVE decision making&nbsp;using data for day to day, how to reduce risk and how to inform the company on achieving and adapting the company’s strategy.  BUILD relationships&nbsp;to source data both within your business and the wider ecosystem. This is both to determine the quality of the data and be able to better use data and or roll out solutions that improve quality and decision-making.  KNOW what technical questions&nbsp;to ask and being able to live with the complexity involved in the delivery.  <p>Decision making is a complex affair, and as CDO’s we are there to support. Decisions are perceived to be easier when there is lots of data, and the signal is big, loud and really clear. Big data has a place, but we must not forget small signals from&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnography">ethnographic data</a>&nbsp;sources. Leadership often does not know what to do with critical and challenging small data, especially when it challenges easy assumptions that big data justifies.</p><blockquote><p>A CDO superpower is to shine a light on all data, without bias</p></blockquote><p>Our superpower is to shine a light on all data, without bias, and help strategic thinkers, who often put a higher value on quantitative data. They didn’t know how to handle data that wasn’t easily measurable does not show up in existing paid-for reports. Ethnographic work has a serious perception problem in a data-driven decision world. A key role of the CDO is to uncover all data and its value, not bias to a bigger data set — that is just lazy. I love this image from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/triciawang/">@triciawang</a>, where the idea of critical small data set is represented as “thick data.” Do follow her work&nbsp;<a href="https://www.triciawang.com/">https://www.triciawang.com/</a>&nbsp;or that of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/genevievebell/">Genevieve Bell</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://katecrawford.net/about.html">Kate Crawford</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.danah.org/">danah boyd&nbsp;</a>(<a href="https://twitter.com/zephoria">@zephoria</a>).</p>          <p>Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/ethnography-matters/why-big-data-needs-thick-data-b4b3e75e3d7">Nokia’s experience of ignoring small data</a></p> Note to the CEO <p>Digital transformation has built a dependence on data, and the bigger the data set, the more weight it is assumed to have. Often, there is a dangerous assumption made that the risk in a decision is reduced because of the data set's size. It may be true for operational issues and automated decision making but not necessarily for strategy.</p><p>As the CEO, you need to determine the half-life of the data used to justify or solidify a decision. Half-life in science is when more than 50 per cent of a substance has undergone a radical change; in business terms, this is when half the value of the data is lost or a doubling of the error. The bigger the data set, the quicker (shorter) the half-life will be. Indeed some data’s half-life is less than the time it took to collect and store it. It is big but it really has no value. For small data sets, such as ethnographic data, the half-life can be longer than a 3 to 5 years strategic planning cycle. Since some data might be small and could be a signal to your future, supporting a CDO who puts equal weight on all data is critical to success.</p>

The SOFIE Project wrapped up at the end of last year a key part of this research focused on the the use of SSI concepts in three IoT sectors (energy, supply chain, and mixed reality gaming) targeting integrating SSI in without requiring changes to the existing IoT systems.</p><p>Our three presenters were from two different European research universities, Aalto University (Dr. Dmitrij Lagutin and Dr. Yki Kortesniemi) and Athens University of Economics and Business (Dr. Nikos Fotiou)</p><p>The presentation covered four areas of interest in SSI the IoT sector:</p>  <p>DIDs and VCs on constrained devices</p>  <p>Access control using the W3C Web of Things (WoT) Thing Description</p>  <p>did:self method</p>  <p>Ephemeral DIDs and Ring signatures</p>  <p>Each of these research areas are integrated into real world use cases and connected to the sectors that were part of the SOFIR project’s mandate.</p><p>(Note: There were some ‘technical issues’ at the start of the event and the introduction part of the presentation has been truncated, but the good new is all of our presenters content is there.)</p><p>To listen to a recording of the event please check out the link: <a href="https://vimeo.com/530442817">https://vimeo.com/530442817</a></p><p>Time markers: </p>  <p>0:00:00 - SOFIE Project Introduction, (Dr. Dmitrij Lagutin)</p>  <p>0:02:33 - DIDs and VCs on constrained devices </p>  <p>0:14:00 - Access Control for WoT using VCs (Dr. Nikos Fotiou)</p>  <p>0:33:23 - did:self method </p>  <p>0:46:00 - Ephemeral DIDs and Ring Signatures (Dr. Yki Kortesniemi)</p>  <p>1:07:29 - Wrap-up &amp; Upcoming Events </p>  <p>Resources</p><p>The SOFIE Project Slide deck: <a href="https://www.thedinglegroup.com/s/SOFIE-DIDs-and-VCs-Digital-Identity-Event-2232021.pdf">download</a></p><p>And as a reminder,  we continue to have online only events. </p><p>If interested in getting notifications of upcoming events please join the event group at: <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Vienna-Digital-Identity-Meetup/">https://www.meetup.com/Vienna-Digital-Identity-Meetup/ </a></p><p>*The Vienna Digital Identity Meetup is hosted by The Dingle Group and is focused on educating business, societal, legal and technologists on the new opportunities that arise with  a high assurance digital identity created by the reduction risk and strengthened provenance.

<p>Of the deeper thoughts I might give to this moment, I have <a href="https://fossandcrafts.org/episodes/25-governance-leadership-founders-syndrome.html">given them elsewhere</a>.  For this blogpost, I just want to speak of feelings... feelings of hurt and hope.</p>
<p>I am reaching out, collecting the feelings of those I see around me, writing them in my mind's journal.  Though I hold clear positions in this moment, there are few roots of feeling and emotion about the moment I feel I haven't steeped in myself at some time.  Sometimes I tell this to friends, and they think maybe I am drifting from a mutual position, and this is painful for them.  Perhaps they fear this could constitute or signal some kind of betrayal.  I don't know what to say: I've been here too long to feel just one thing, even if I can commit to one position.</p>
<p>So I open my journal of feelings, and here I share some of the pages collecting the pain I see around me:</p>
<p>The irony of a movement wanting to be so logical and above feelings being drowned in them.</p>
<p>The feelings of those who found a comfortable and welcoming home in a world of loneliness, and the split between despondence and outrage for that unraveling.</p>
<p>The feelings of those who wanted to join that home too, but did not feel welcome.</p>
<p>The pent up feelings of those unheard for so long, uncorked and flowing.</p>
<p>The weight and shadow of a central person who seems to feel things so strongly but cannot, and does not care to learn to, understand the feelings of those around them.</p>
<p>I flip a few pages ahead.  The pages are blank, and I interpret this as new chapters for us to write, together.</p>
<p>I hope we might re-discover the heart of our movement.</p>
<p>I hope we can find a place past the pain of the present, healing to build the future.</p>
<p>I hope we can build a new home, strong enough to serve us and keep us safe, but without the walls, moat, and throne of a fortress.</p>
<p>I hope we can be a movement that lives up to our claims: of justice, of freedom, of human rights, to bring these to everyone, especially those we haven't reached.</p>

If we reflect on it, finance has been shoring up its position for a while.&nbsp; HR, tech, processes, methods, branding, IP, legal, and culture have become subservient and controlled by finance. In the finance control game, we are all just an asset or liability and set a budget!&nbsp; In the context of control and power and how to make better decisions, as a CDO, your friends and partners are human resources, tech, legal, operations, marketing, sales and strategy; your threat and enemy is finance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>A critical inquiry you will have on day 0 is what weight do we, this organisation, put on the aspects of good decision making? How do we order and with what authority data, finance,&nbsp; team, processes/methods, justifications, regulation, culture/brand/reputation, compliance/oversight/ governance,&nbsp; reporting and stewardship? What is more important to us as a team; the trustworthiness or truthfulness of a decision?&nbsp; The quality of a decision? The explainability of a decision? The ability to communicate a decision or diversity in a decision?&nbsp; If data is controlled by finance and seen as an asset or liability, how does it affect your decision making capability?</p><p>As the CDO, if you determine that the axis of control remains with the CEO/ CFO it may be time to align your skill to a CEO gets data.&nbsp;</p><p>Note to the CEO</p><p>It is your choice, but your new CDO is your new CFO in terms of power for decision making, which means there will be a swing in the power game. Your existing CEO/ CFO axis is under threat, and we know that underhanded and political games will emerge in all changes of power.&nbsp; You will lead the choice about how you want this to play out given that all CEO’s need to find their next role every 5 to 7 years, which will only ever require more interactions with the CDO and data, defending the CFO power plays will not bring favour to your next role.&nbsp; The CFO remains critically essential, but the existing two-way axis (CEO/CFO) has to become a three-way game that enables the CDO to shine until a new power balance is reached.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <br>

<p>In 2018 I built a <a href="https://web.hypothes.is/blog/annotation-powered-questionnaires/">tool</a> to help researchers evaluate a proposed set of <a href="https://credweb.org/reviewed-signals-20200224/">credibility signals</a> intended to enable <a href="https://misinfocon.com/how-annotation-enables-machine-learning-fc4b0ceab10a">automated systems</a> to rate the credibility of news stories.</p>
<p>Here are examples of such signals:</p>
<p>– Authors cite expert sources (positive)</p>
<p>– Title is clickbaity (negative)</p>
<p>And my favorite:</p>
<p>– Authors acknowledge uncertainty (positive)</p>
<p>Will the news ecosystem ever be able to label stories automatically based on automatic detection of such signals, and if so, should it? These are open questions. The best way to improve news literacy may be the <a href="https://hapgood.us/2019/06/19/sift-the-four-moves/">SIFT</a> method advocated by Mike Caulfield, which shifts attention away from intrinsic properties of individual news stories and advises readers to:</p>
<p>– Stop</p>
<p>– Investigate the source</p>
<p>– Find better coverage</p>
<p>– Trace claims, quotes, and media to original context</p>
<p>“The goal of SIFT,” writes Charlie Warzel in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/18/opinion/fake-news-media-attention.html">Don’t Go Down the Rabbit Hole</a>, “isn’t to be the arbiter of truth but to instill a reflex that asks if something is worth one’s time and attention and to turn away if not.”</p>
<p>SIFT favors extrinsic signals over the intrinsic ones that were the focus of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/credibility/">W3C Credible Web Community Group</a>. But intrinsic signals may yet play an important role, if not as part of a large-scale automated labeling effort then at least as another kind of news literacy reflex.</p>
<p>This morning, in <a href="https://www.bozemandailychronicle.com/ap_news/commentary-how-public-health-officials-can-convince-those-reluctant-to-get-the-covid-19-vaccine/article_0d3d0540-8c55-5f55-9078-f6ca2052cf4e.html">How public health officials can convince those reluctant to get the COVID-19 vaccine</a>, I read the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>What made these Trump supporters shift their views on vaccines? Science — offered straight-up and with a dash of humility.</p>
<p>The unlikely change agent was Dr. Tom Frieden, who headed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during the Obama administration. Frieden appealed to facts, not his credentials. He noted that the theory behind the vaccine was backed by 20 years of research, that tens of thousands of people had participated in well-controlled clinical trials, and that the overwhelming share of doctors have opted for the shots.</p>
<p>He leavened those facts with an acknowledgment of uncertainty. He conceded that the vaccine’s potential long-term risks were unknown. He pointed out that the virus’s long-term effects were also uncertain.</p>
<p>“He’s just honest with us and telling us nothing is 100% here, people,” one participant noted.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here’s evidence that acknowledgement of uncertainty really is a powerful signal of credibility. Maybe machines will be able to detect it and label it; maybe those labels will matter to people. Meanwhile, it’s something people can detect and do care about. Teaching students to value sources that acknowledge uncertainty, and discount ones that don’t, ought to be part of any strategy to improve news literacy.</p>

  Several years ago I bought two 5-packs of reading glasses. There was a 1.75-diopter set for books, magazines, newspapers, and my laptop (when it’s in my lap), plus a 1.25-diopter set for the screens I look at when working in my Captain Kirk chair.

<p>Several years ago I bought two 5-packs of reading glasses. There was a 1.75-diopter set for books, magazines, newspapers, and my laptop (when it’s in my lap), plus a 1.25-diopter set for the screens I look at when working in my <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2009/03/14/the-floating-arms-keyboard/">Captain Kirk chair</a>. They were cheap, and the idea was that they’d be an abundant resource. I could leave spectacles lying around in various places, there would always be a pair handy, no worries about losing them.</p>
<p>So of course I did lose them like crazy. At one point I bought another 5-pack but still, somehow, I’m down to a single 1.75 and a single 1.25. And I just realized it’s been that way for quite a while. Now that the resource is scarce, I value it more highly and take care to preserve it.</p>
<p>I’m sorely tempted to restock. It’s so easy! A couple of clicks and two more 5-packs will be here tomorrow. And they’re cheap, so what’s not to like?</p>
<p>For now, I’m resisting the temptation because I don’t like the effect such radical abundance has had on me. It’s ridiculous to lose 13 pairs of glasses in a couple of years. I can’t imagine how I’d explain that to my pre-Amazon self.</p>
<p>For now, I’m going to try to assign greater value to the glasses I do have, and treat them accordingly. And when I finally do lose them, I hope I’ll resist the one-click solution. I thought it was brilliant at the time, and part of me still does. But it just doesn’t feel good.</p>

<p>Note: This post is the sole opinion and perspective of the&nbsp;author.</p><p>Over the past several months I have been diligently attempting to map the dynamically evolving world of trust frameworks and verifiable credentials into a straightforward and hopefully timeless terminology that can be used for policymaking. The storyboard diagram above is what I’ve come up with so&nbsp;far.</p>  Counterparty — for every consequential relationship or transaction there are at a minimum of two parties involved. Regardless of whether the interaction is collaborative, competitive, zero positive sum, they can be considered as counterparties to one&nbsp;another.  Claim — is the something that is the matter of concern between the counterparties — it can be financial, tangible, intangible; something in the present, or a promise of something in the&nbsp;future.  Offer — a counterparty offers something that usually relates to a&nbsp;Claim.  Commit — a counterparty can commit to its&nbsp;Offer.  Present — a counterparty can present an Offer (or a&nbsp;Claim).  Accept — on the other side, the other counterparty accepts an&nbsp;Offer.  Issue — An Offer, once formed, can be issued in whatever form — usually a document or credential that is signed by the counterparty.  Hold — An offer can be held. How it is held depends on its embodiment (e.g.., digital, paper, verbal,&nbsp;etc.)  Verify — An offer, or more specifically its embodiment can be verified for its origin and integrity.  <p>All of the above is made possible&nbsp;by:</p>  Business Trust — how the counterparties decide to trust one another. This is the non-technical aspect of agreements, rules, treaties, legislation, etc.  <p>And underpinned by:</p>  Technical Trust: how the counterparties prove to another that their trust has not been compromised. This the technical aspect that includes, cryptographic protocols, data formats,&nbsp;etc.  <p>Why is this useful? When writing policy, you need a succinct model which is clear enough for subsequent interpretation. To do this, you need conceptual buckets to drop things into. Yes, this model is likely to change, but it’s my best and latest crack at it to synthesize the complex world of digital credentials with an abstraction that might be useful to help us align existing solutions while adopting exciting new capabilities.</p><p>As always, I am open for comment and constructive feedback. You know where to find&nbsp;me.</p>

<p>It’s no secret we need a better web. The original vision of an open and decentralized network that’s universally accessible continues to be a north star for those working to design the future of digital infrastructure for everyday people. Despite the progress that has been made in democratising access to massive amounts of information, the dire state of cybersecurity and privacy on the internet today present significant barriers to access for too many of our most vulnerable populations. We started MATTR because we believe that standards, transparency, and openness are not only better for users; they make for stronger systems and more resilient networks. We recognize that a decentralized web of digital trust, based on transparency, consent, and verifiable data, can help us address critical challenges on a global scale. It represents a significant opportunity to give people real agency and control over their digital&nbsp;lives.</p> Our story <p>At its inception, we chose “MATTR” as a moniker because we strongly believed that the movement towards more decentralized systems will fundamentally change the nature of data and privacy on the internet. Matter, in its varying states, forms the building blocks of the universe, symbolically representing the capacity for change and transformation that allows us all to grow and adapt. In another sense, people matter, and the impact of decisions we make as builders of technology extend beyond ourselves. It’s a responsibility we take seriously, as Tim Berners Lee puts it, “to preserve new frontiers for the common good.” We proudly bear the name MATTR and the potential it represents as we’ve built out our little universe of products.</p><p>In September 2020, we <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/introducing-the-mattr-platform-91db4925c773">introduced</a> our decentralized identity platform. Our goal was to deliver standards-based digital trust to developers in a scalable manner. We designed our platform with a modular security architecture to enable our tools to work across many different contexts. By investing deeply in open standards and open source communities as well as developing insights through collaboration and research, we realized that developers want to use something that’s convenient without compromising on flexibility, choice, or security. That’s why we launched our platform with standards-based cryptography and configurable building blocks to suit a broad array of use cases and user experiences in a way that can evolve as technology matures.</p><p>At the same time, we’ve continued to work in open source and open standards communities with greater commitment than ever to make sure we’re helping to build a digital ecosystem that can support global scale. We launched <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/">MATTR Learn</a> and <a href="https://mattr.global/resources/">MATTR Resources</a> as hubs for those interested in these new technologies, developing educational content to explore concepts around decentralized identity, offering guided developer tutorials and videos, and providing documentation and API references. We also unveiled a <a href="https://mattr.global/">new website</a>, introduced a novel approach to <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/a-solution-for-privacy-preserving-verifiable-credentials-f1650aa16093">selective disclosure of verifiable credentials</a>, built and defined a <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/jwm-a-new-standard-for-secure-messaging-a21d3daa4403">new secure messaging standard</a>, developed a prototype for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXvWxFjHvdY">paper-based credentials</a> to cater for low-tech environments, and made a bridge to <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/introducing-oidc-credential-provider-7845391a9881">extend OpenID Connect with verifiable credentials</a>. We’ve consistently released tools and added features to make our products more secure, extensible, and easy to use. In parallel, we also <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/news/2020/10/09/news-release-dhs-st-svip-makes-new-phase-1-awards-five-blockchain-companies">joined the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s SVIP program</a> in October to help advance the goals of decentralized identity and demonstrate provable interoperability with other vendors in a transparent and globally-visible manner. Zooming out a bit, our journey at MATTR is part of a much larger picture of passionate people working in collaborative networks across the world to make this&nbsp;happen.</p> The bigger&nbsp;picture <p>It has been an incredible year for decentralized and self-sovereign identity as a whole. In light of the global-scale disruption of COVID-19, the demand for more secure digital systems became even more critical to our everyday lives. Start-ups, corporations, governments, and standards organizations alike have been heavily investing in building technology and infrastructure to support an increasingly digital world. We’re seeing this innovation happen across the globe, from the work being done by the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/svip">DHS Silicon Valley Innovation Program</a> to the <a href="https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/">Pan-Canadian Trust Framework</a> and <a href="https://www.digital.govt.nz/news/development-of-digital-identity-trust-framework-confirmed/">New Zealand Digital Identity Trust Framework</a>. Many global leaders are stepping up to support and invest in more privacy-preserving digital security, and for good reason. Recent legislation like <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a> and <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">CCPA</a> have made the role of big tech companies and user data rights increasingly important, providing a clear mandate for a wave of change that promises to strengthen the internet for the public good. This provides an incredible catalyst for all the work happening in areas such as cryptography, decentralized computing and digital governance. Just in the last year, we’ve seen the following advancements:</p>  <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/secure-data-storage.html">Secure Data Storage WG</a> created at <a href="https://identity.foundation/">DIF</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a> to realize an interoperable technology for encrypted and confidential data&nbsp;storage  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers</a> v1.0 specification reached “Candidate Recommendation” stage at the W3C, establishing stability in anticipation of standardization later this&nbsp;year  <a href="https://identity.foundation/sidetree/spec/">Sidetree protocol</a> v1.0 released at DIF, providing a layer-2 blockchain solution for scalable Decentralized Identifiers built on top of ledgers such as Bitcoin and&nbsp;Ethereum  <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging v2.0</a> specification launched at DIF, a new protocol for secure messaging based on Decentralized Identifiers and built on JOSE encryption standards  <a href="https://identity.foundation/did-siop/">Self-Issued OpenID</a> (SIOP) became an official working group item at the <a href="https://openid.net/foundation/">OpenID Foundation</a>, advancing the conversation around the role of identity providers on the&nbsp;web  Google’s <a href="https://github.com/WICG/WebID">WebID project</a> started developing features to allow the browser to mediate interactions between end-users and identity providers in a privacy-preserving way  <p>For more information on how all of these technologies are interconnected, read our latest paper, <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/the-state-of-identity-on-the-web-cffc392bc7ea">The State of Identity on the&nbsp;Web</a>.</p><p>In addition, as part of our involvement with the DHS SVIP program, in March of this year we participated in the DHS SVIP Interoperability Plugfest. This event saw 8 different companies, representing both human-centric identity credentials as well as asset-centric supply chain traceability credentials, come together to showcase standards-compliance and genuine cross-vendor and cross-platform interoperability via testing and live demonstrations. The full presentation, including demos and videos from the public showcase day, can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MeeP7vDXb9CpSBfjTybYbo8qJfrrbrXCSJa0DklNe2k/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p><p>These are just a handful of the significant accomplishments achieved over the last year. It’s been incredibly inspiring to see so many people working towards a common set of goals for the betterment of the web. As we’ve built our products and developed alongside the broader market, we’ve learned quite a bit about how to solve some of the core business and technical challenges associated with this new digital infrastructure. We’ve also gained a lot of insight from working directly with governments and companies across the globe to demonstrate interoperability and build bridges across different technology ecosystems.</p> Launching MATTR&nbsp;VII <p>We’ve been hard at work making our decentralized identity platform better than ever, and we’re proud to announce that as of today, we’re ready to support solutions that solve real-world problems for your users, in production — and it’s open to everybody.</p><p>That’s why we’re rebranding our platform to MATTR VII. Inspired by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_matter">seven states of matter</a>, our platform gives builders and developers all the tools they need at their fingertips to create a whole new universe of decentralized products and applications. We provide all the raw technical building blocks to allow you to create exactly what you have in mind. MATTR VII is composable and configurable to fit your needs, whether you’re a well-established business with legacy systems or a start-up looking to build the next best thing in digital privacy. Best of all, MATTR VII is use-case-agnostic, meaning we’ve baked minimal dependencies into our products so you can use them the way that makes the most sense for&nbsp;you.</p><p>Starting today, we’re opening our platform for general availability. Specifically, that means if you’re ready to build a solution to solve a real-world problem for your users, we’re ready to support you. Simply <a href="https://mattr.global/contact/">contact us</a> to get the ball rolling and to have your production environment set up. Of course, if you’re not quite ready for that, you can still test drive the platform by signing up for a <a href="https://mattr.global/get-started/">free trial</a> of MATTR VII to get started right away. It’s an exciting time in the MATTR universe, and we’re just getting&nbsp;started.</p><p>We’re continuing to build-out features to operationalize and support production use cases. To this end, in the near future we will be enhancing the sign-up and onboarding experience as well as providing tools to monitor your usage of the platform. Please <a href="https://mattr.global/contact/">reach out</a> to give us feedback on how we can improve our products to support the solutions you’re building.</p><p>We’re excited to be in this new phase of our journey with MATTR VII. It will no doubt be another big year for decentralized identity, bringing us closer to the ultimate goal of bringing cryptography and digital trust to every person on the&nbsp;web.</p><p>Follow us on <a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">Medium</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/mattrglobal">Twitter</a> for further&nbsp;updates.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/launching-mattr-vii-4e11bcb9aaef">Why we’re launching MATTR VII</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  How “Assume positive intent” downplays impact, gaslights employees, and absolves leaders of responsibility.

<p>Lets talk about that well-worn bit of wisdom: “assume positive intent.” On the
surface it’s excellent advice: practice empathy by mindfully assuming that
people may create issues despite their best intentions. You’ve heard the
parables, from Steven Covey’s <a href="http://people.tamu.edu/~v-buenger/658/Steven_Covey.html" title="Steven Covey: Paradigms and the 7 Habits">paradigm shift on the subway</a> to
David Foster Wallace’s <a href="https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~drkelly/DFWKenyonAddress2005.pdf" title="Transcription of the 2005 Kenyon Commencement Address - May 21, 2005 — Written and Delivered by David Foster Wallace">latent condemnation</a> of gas-guzzling traffic
and soul-sucking supermarkets. Pepsi CEO Indra Nooyi has <a href="https://archive.fortune.com/galleries/2008/fortune/0804/gallery.bestadvice.fortune/7.html" title="The best advice I ever got — Indra Nooyi">popularized the
notion</a> to ubiquity in corporate America.</p>
<p>In practice, the assumption of positive intent enables some pretty serious
anti-patterns.</p>
<p>First, focusing on intent downplays impact. Good intentions don’t change the
outcomes of one’s actions: we still must deal with whatever broke. At best, good
intentions enable openness to feedback and growth, but do not erase those
mistakes.</p>
<p>Which leads us to a more fundamental dilemma. In a <a href="https://forge.medium.com/the-problem-with-assuming-positive-intent-ea8385ce961d" title="The Problem With Assuming Positive Intent">piece for Medium</a> last year,
<a href="https://medium.com/@ruth_terry/about">Ruth Terry</a>, quoting the <a href="http://kirwaninstitute.osu.edu/" title="Kirwan Institute for the Study of Race and Ethnicity">Kirwan Institute</a>’s Lena Tenney, summarizes it aptly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By downplaying actual impact, assuming positive intent can deprioritize the
experience of already marginalized people.</p>
<p>“All of this focus on intention essentially remarginalizes a person of color
who’s speaking up about racism by telling them that their experience doesn’t
matter because the person didn’t mean it that way,” says Tenney, who helped
create interactive implicit bias learning tools for the Kirwan Institute.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This remarginalization of the vulnerable seriously undermines the convictions
behind “assume positive intent,” not to mention the culture at large. But the
impact transcends racial contexts: it appears wherever people present
uncomfortable issues to people in a dominant position.</p>
<p>Take the workplace. A brave employee publicly calls out a problematic behavior
or practice, often highlighting implicit bias or, at the very least, patterns
that contradict the professed values of the organization. Management nods and
says, “I’m glad you brought that up, but it’s important for us all to assume
positive intent in our interactions with our co-workers.” Then they explain the
context for the actions, or, more likely, list potential mitigating details —
without the diligence of investigation or even consequences. Assume positive
intent, guess at or manufacture explanations, but little more.</p>
<p>This response minimizes the report’s impact to management while simultaneously
de-emphasizing the experience of the worker who voiced it. Such brave folks,
speaking just a little truth to power, may start to doubt themselves or what
they’ve seen. The manager has successfully <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting" title="Wikpedia: “Gaslighting”">gaslighted</a> the worker.</p>
<p>Leaders: please don’t do this. The phrase is not “Assume positive intent for me,
but not for thee.” Extend the assumption only to the people reporting
uncomfortable issues. There’s a damn good chance they came to you only by the
assumption of positive intent: if your coworkers thought you had ill-intent,
they would not speak at all.</p>
<p>If you feel inclined to defend behavior or patterns based on presumption of
good intent, avoid that reflex, too. Good intent may be key to transgressors
accepting difficult feedback, but hold them accountable and don’t let
assumptions stand on their own. Impact matters, and so must consequences.</p>
<p>Most importantly, Never use the assumption of good intent to downplay or
dismiss the crucial but uncomfortable or inconvenient feedback brave souls bring
to you.</p>
<p>Assume positive intent in yourself, never assert it in others, and know that,
regardless of intent, problems still must be addressed without making excuses or
devaluing or dismissing the people who have suffered them.</p>

<p>Were it not for the Wayback Machine, a lot of my post-1995 writing would now be gone. Since the advent of online-only publications, getting published has been a lousy way to stay published. When pubs change hands, or die, the works of their writers tend to evaporate.</p>
<p>I’m not a great self-archivist, despite having better-than-average skills for the job. Many but not all of my professional archives are preserved — for now! — on my website. Occasionally, when I reach for a long-forgotten and newly-relevant item, only to find it 404, I’ll dig around and try to resurrect it. The forensic effort can be a big challenge; an even bigger one is avoiding self-blame.</p>
<p>The same thing happens with personal archives. When our family lived in New Delhi in the early 1960s, my dad captured thousands of images. Those <a href="http://jonudell.info/IndiaSlides/">color slides</a>, curated in carousels and projected onto our living room wall in the years following, solidified the memories of what my five-year-old self had directly experienced. When we moved my parents to the facility where they spent their last years, one big box of those slides went missing. I try, not always successfully, to avoid blaming myself for that loss.</p>
<p>When our kids were little we didn’t own a videocassette recorder, which was how you captured home movies in that era. Instead we’d rent a VCR from Blockbuster every 6 months or so and spend the weekend filming. It turned out to be a great strategy. We’d set it on a table or on the floor, turn it on, and just let it run. The kids would forget it was there, and we recorded hours of precious daily life in episodic installments.</p>
<p>Five years ago our son-in-law volunteered the services of a friend of his to digitize those tapes, and brought us the MP4s on a thumb drive. I put copies in various “safe” places. Then we moved a couple of times, and when I reached for the digitized videos, they were gone. As were the original cassettes. This time around, there was no avoiding the self-blame. I beat myself up about it, and was so mortified that I hesitated to ask our daughter and son-in-law if they have safe copies. (Spoiler alert: they do.) Instead I’d periodically dig around in various hard drives, clouds, and boxes, looking for files or thumb drives that had to be there somewhere.</p>
<p>During this period of self-flagellation, I thought constantly about something I heard Roger Angell say about Carlton Fisk. Roger Angell was one of the greatest baseball writers, and Carlton Fisk one of the greatest players. One day I happened to walk into a bookstore in Harvard Square when Angell was giving a talk. In the Q and A, somebody asked: “What’s the most surprising thing you’ve ever heard a player say?”</p>
<p>The player was Carlton Fisk, and the surprise was his answer to the question: “How many time have you seen the video clip of your most famous moment?”</p>
<p>That moment is one of the most-watched sports clips ever: Fisk’s walk-off home run in game 6 of the 1975 World Series. He belts the ball deep to left field, it veers toward foul territory, he dances and waves it fair.</p>
<p>So, how often did Fisk watch that clip? Never.</p>
<p>Why not? He didn’t want to overwrite the original memory.</p>
<p>Of course we are always revising our memories. Photographic evidence arguably prevents us from doing so. Is that good or bad? I honestly don’t know. Maybe both.</p>
<p>For a while, when I thought those home videos were gone for good, I tried to convince myself that it was OK. The original memories live in my mind, I hold them in my heart, nothing can take them away, no recording can improve them.</p>
<p>Although that sort of worked, I was massively relieved when I finally fessed up to my negligence and learned that there are safe copies. For now, I haven’t requested them and don’t need to see them. It’s enough to know that they exist.</p>

<p>After the OAuth 2.0 JWT Secured Authorization Request (JAR) specification <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=2121">was sent to the RFC Editor</a>, the IESG requested an additional round of IETF feedback.  We’ve published an updated draft addressing the remaining review comments, specifically, SecDir comments from Watson Ladd.  The only normative change made since the 28 was to change the MIME Type from “<code>oauth.authz.req+jwt</code>” to “<code>oauth-authz-req+jwt</code>”, per advice from the designated experts.</p>
<p>As a reminder, this specification takes the JWT Request Object from <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#JWTRequests">Section 6 of OpenID Connect Core (Passing Request Parameters as JWTs)</a> and makes this functionality available for pure OAuth 2.0 applications – and does so without introducing breaking changes.  This is one of a series of specifications bringing functionality originally developed for OpenID Connect to the OAuth 2.0 ecosystem.  Other such specifications included OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7591">RFC 7591</a>] and OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8414">RFC 8414</a>].</p>
<p>The specification is available at:</p>
 
 <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-jwsreq-31">https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-jwsreq-31</a>

    This article is about how to ensure Directors gain assurance about “data” that is supporting the recommendations in a Board paper.  <p></p><br><p>I have read, written and presented my fair share of Board and Investment Committee papers over the past 25 years. As Directors, we are collectively accountable and responsible for the decisions we take. I can now observe a skills gap regarding “data”, with many board members assuming and trusting the data that forms the basis on which they are asked to approve. There are good processes, methods and procedures for ensuring that any Board papers presented are factual. However, decisions using big-data and their associated analysis tools, including ML and AI, which drives automation, is new and requires different expertise at a higher level of detail.&nbsp; Challenging data is different from finding it hard to question in detail any C-suite on their specific expertise and, more generally, the general counsel, CFO and CTO.&nbsp; The CDO/ CIO axis bridges the value line being both a cost and revenue.&nbsp; With “data” as the business driver, it remains superficially easier to question costs without understanding the consequences on our future decision ability and even harder to unpack unethical revenue.&nbsp;</p><p>A classic “board paper” will likely have the following headings: Introduction, Background, Rationale, Structure/ Operations, Illustrative Financials &amp; Scenarios, Competition, Risks and Legal. Case by case, there are always minor adjustments. Finally, some form of recommendation will invite the board to note key facts and approve the action.&nbsp; I believe it is time for the Chair or CEO, with the support of their senior data lead (#CDO), to ask that each board paper has a new section heading called “Data Attestation.”&nbsp; A section on Data Attestation will be a declaration that there are traceable evidence and proof of the data and the action of the presenter being a witness to certifying it.&nbsp; Some teams will favour this as an addition to the main flow, some as a new part of legal, others as an appendix and some will claim it is already inherent in the process. How and where matters little compared to its intent.</p><p>Such a section could provide a solution until such time that we can gain sufficient skills at the Board and test data correctly.&nbsp; Yes, there is a high duty of care that is already intrinsic in anyone who presents a board paper (already inherent). However, the data expertise and skills at most senior levels are also well below what we need because all the politics, bias and complexity is in the weeds, which is both easy not to know and hide.&nbsp; Board members have to continue to question performance metrics (KPI and BSC) to determine the motivation for any decision, but having to trust “data sets” a different standard to those we have with audit, finance, legal and compliance.&nbsp; If nothing else, a “data attestation statement” will set a hurdle for those presenting to prioritise bias, ethics and consequences of data used in their proposal.&nbsp;</p><p>Having to trust data sets a different standard to those we have with audit, finance, legal and compliance.</p>  Arguments for and against  <p>Key assumptions</p>  <p>Data is critically important to our future and is foundational for decision making going forward.</p>  <p>Data is more complex today and continues to increase in complexity.</p>  <p>The C-suite and leadership team are experts in their disciplines and has deep expertise in their critical areas, but there is a data skills gap.</p>  <p>There is a recognition at the board that data bias, a lack of audibility, provenance, and data lineage can lead to flawed/bad decision making.</p>  <p>Based on these working assumptions, I do not believe that adding a “Data Attestation” section is a long term fix.&nbsp; Whilst to comply with Section 172 of the Companies Act, it is an absolute requirement to meet the fiduciary duties that we upskill.&nbsp; But data is not like marking, technology, operations, finance or HR - data is new, and the vast majority of boards and senior leadership team have little experience in big data,&nbsp; data analytics or coding.&nbsp; It is a recognition that education and skills development is a better solution, but in the gap between today and skills arriving, we should do something? &nbsp; Critically, I would support introducing a data attestation section with a set date where it falls away.&nbsp;</p><p>It is essential to consider as insurance companies who offer D&amp;O policies are looking at new clauses related to the capability of Directors who make decisions based on data and their ability to know the data was “fit for purpose” for the decision. Insurance companies need to protect their claims business and might feel that the upskilling might take to long.</p><p>Why might this work? Do you get on a plane and ask to pilot it?&nbsp; Do you go to the hospital with the correct google answer or ask a qualified Doctor?&nbsp; We need to form our own view that someone has checked whether the pilot and doctor are qualified.&nbsp; Today, we outsource Audit to a committee because of this same issue; it is complex. But Data is not finance, and data is not an Audit committee issue. Data is a different skill set.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Each Board has to make its own choice. The easiest is to justify to oneself that our existing processes are good enough and we are following “best practices”, compliance thinking. &nbsp; Given the 76 recommendations in the <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/852960/brydon-review-final-report.pdf">Sir Donald Brydon Review of Audit</a>, assuming that our existing processes are good enough is difficult to justify. If we want to make better decisions with data, we need to make sure we can.&nbsp;</p>  Recommendation  <p>A strong recommendation would be to put in place an “Attestation Clause”, a drop-dead date, a 2-year mandatory data training program aimed at the senior leadership team and Directors/ Board members and a succession plan that priorities data skills for new senior and board (inc NXD) roles.</p>  Proposal  <p>A “data attestation” section intends that the board receives a *signed* declaration from the proposer(s) and independent data expert that the proposer has:</p>  <p>proven attestation of the data used in the board paper,&nbsp;</p>  <p>proven rights to use the data</p>  <p>what difference/ delta third-party data makes the recommendation/ outcome</p>  <p>ensured, to best efforts, that there is no bias or selection in the data or analysis</p>  <p>clearly specified any decision making that is or becomes automated&nbsp;</p>  <p>if relevant, created the hypothesis before the analysis&nbsp;</p>  <p>run scenarios using different data and tools</p>  <p>not miss-led the board using data</p>  <p>highlighted the conflicts of interest between their BSC/KPI and the approval sort</p>  <p>The independent auditor should not be the companies financial auditor or data lake provider; this should be an independent forensic data expert. Audit suggests sampling; this is not about sampling. It is not about creating more hurdles or handing power to an external body; this is about 3rd party verification and validation. As a company, you build a list of experts and cycle through them regularly. The auditor does not need to see the board paper, the outcome from the analysis or the recommendations - they are there to check the attestation and efficacy from end to end.&nbsp; Critical will be proof of their expertise and an insurance certificate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Whilst this is not the final wording you will use, it is the intent that is important; this does not negate or novate data risks from the risk section.</p><p>Example of a Data Attestation section</p><p>We certify by our signatures that we, the proposer and auditor, can prove to OurCompany (PLC) Board that we have provable <a href="https://tonyfish.medium.com/does-data-have-a-purpose-57249c7c8e1e">attestation and rights</a> to all the data used in this paper’s presentation. &nbsp; We have presented in this paper sensitivity of the selected data, model and tools and have provided evidence that different data and analysis tool selection equally favours the recommendation.&nbsp; We have tested and can verify that our data, analysis, insights, and knowledge is traceable and justifiable.&nbsp; We declare that there are no Conflicts of Interest, and no automation of decision making will result from this approval.&nbsp;</p><p></p><br><br><br>

<p>と、堂々たる顔ぶれです。</p>



<p>パネルの構造としては、まず、私から、「トラストとは」ということを若干お話して、その後を受けて、横田頭取、カー氏、モウ氏と行って、それを受けて松尾事務局長に当局の視点からのお話をいただき、15分ほどフリーディスカッション→クロージング、という形を考えております。</p>



<p>今年は、オンライン・オフライン組み合わせたハイブリッド開催のようです。もしお時間があるようでしたら、ご覧いただければと思います。チケットは<a href="https://eventregist.com/e/finsum2021">こちらから購入可能です</a>。会場での参加は10万円と高額ですが、リモートには無料版（アーカイブアクセス不能）、5000円（アーカイブアクセス可能）の種類もあります。</p>

<p>The evolution of identity on the web is happening at a rapid pace, with many different projects and efforts converging around similar ideas with their own interpretations and constraints. It can be difficult to parse through all of these developments while the dust hasn’t completely settled, but looking at these issues holistically, we can see a much bigger pattern emerging. In fact, many of the modern innovations related to identity on the web are actually quite connected and build upon each other in a myriad of complementary ways.</p><p>The rise of OpenID&nbsp;Connect</p><p>The core of modern identity is undoubtedly <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a> (OIDC), the de-facto standard for user authentication and identity protocol on the internet. It’s a protocol that enables developers building apps and services to verify the identity of their users and obtain basic profile information about them in order to create an authenticated user experience. Because OIDC is an identity layer built on top of the OAuth 2.0 framework, it can also be used as an authorization solution. Its development was significant for many reasons, in part because it came with the realization that identity on the web is fundamental to many different kinds of interactions, and these interactions need simple and powerful security features that are ubiquitous and accessible. Secure digital identity is a problem that doesn’t make sense to solve over and over again in different ways with each new application, but instead needs a standard and efficient mechanism that’s easy to use and works for the majority of&nbsp;people.</p><p>OpenID Connect introduced a convenient and accessible protocol for identity that required less setup and complexity for developers building different kinds of applications and programs. In many ways, protocols like OIDC and <a href="https://oauth.net/2/">OAuth 2.0</a> piggy-backed on the revolution that was underfoot in the mid 2000’s as developers fled en-mass from web based systems heavily reliant on technologies like XML (and consequently identity systems built upon these technologies like SAML), for simpler systems based on JSON. OpenID built on the success of OAuth and offered a solution that improved upon existing identity and web security technologies which were vulnerable to attacks like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping">screen scraping</a>. This shift towards a solution built upon modern web technologies with an emphasis on being easy-to-use created ripe conditions for adoption of these web standards.</p><p>OIDC’s success has categorically sped up both the web and native application development cycle when it comes to requiring the integration of identity, and as a result, users have now grown accustomed to having sign-in options aplenty with all their favorite products and services. It’s not intuitively clear to your average user why they need so many different logins and it’s up to the user to manage which identities they use with which services, but the system works and provides a relatively reliable way to integrate identity on the&nbsp;web.</p><p>Success and its unintended consequences</p><p>While OIDC succeeded in simplicity and adoption, what has emerged over time are a number of limitations and challenges that have come as a result of taking these systems to a global&nbsp;scale.</p><p>When it comes to the market for consumer identity, there are generally three main actors&nbsp;present:</p>  Identity Providers  Relying Parties  End-Users  <p>The forces in the market that cause their intersection to exist are complex, but can be loosely broken down into the interaction between each pair of&nbsp;actors.</p><p>In order for an End-User to be able to “login” to a website today, the “sweet spot” must exist where each of these sets of requirements are&nbsp;met.</p><p>The negotiation between these three parties usually plays out on the relying party’s login page. It’s this precious real-estate that drives these very distinct market&nbsp;forces.</p><p>Anti-competitive market&nbsp;forces</p><p>In typical deployments of OIDC, in order for a user to be able to “login” to a relying party or service they’re trying to access online, the relying party must be in direct contact with the Identity Provider (IdP). This is what’s come to be known as the <a href="https://github.com/WICG/WebID#the-idp-tracking-problem">IdP tracking problem</a>. It’s the IdP that’s responsible for performing end-user authentication and issuing end-user identities to relying parties, not the end-users themselves. Over time, these natural forces in OIDC have created an environment that tends to favour the emergence and continued growth of a small number of very large IdPs. These IdPs wield a great deal of power, as they have become a critical dependency and intermediary for many kinds of digital interactions that require identity.</p><p>This environment prevents competition and diversity amongst IdPs in exchange for a convenience-driven technology framework where user data is controlled and managed in a few central locations. The market conditions have made it incredibly difficult for new IdPs to break into the market. For example, when Apple unveiled their “Sign in with Apple” service, they used their position as a proprietary service provider to mandate their inclusion as a third party sign in option for any app or service that was supporting federated login on Apple devices. This effectively guaranteed adoption of their OpenID-based solution, allowing them to easily capture a portion of the precious real-estate that is the login screen of thousands of modern web apps today. This method of capturing the market is indicative of a larger challenge wherein the environment of OIDC has made it difficult for newer and smaller players in the IdP ecosystem to participate with existing vendors on an equal playing&nbsp;field.</p><p>Identity as a secondary concern has primary consequences</p><p>Another key issue in the current landscape is that for nearly all modern IdPs, being an identity provider is often a secondary function to their primary line of business. Though they have come to wear many different hats, many of the key IdPs’ primary business function is offering some service to end-users (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Google, etc.). Their role as IdPs is something that emerged over time, and with it has surfaced a whole new set of responsibilities whose impact we are only just beginning to grapple&nbsp;with.</p><p>Due to this unequal relationship, developers and businesses who want to integrate identity in their applications are forced to choose those IdPs which contain user data for their target demographics, instead of offering options for IdP selection based on real metrics around responsible and privacy-preserving identity practices for end-users.</p><p>This cycle perpetuates the dominance of a few major IdPs and likewise forces users to keep choosing from the same set of options or risk losing access to all of their online accounts. In addition, many of these IdPs have leveraged their role as central intermediaries to increase surveillance and user behavior tracking, not just across their proprietary services, but across a user’s entire web experience. The net result of this architecture on modern systems is that IdPs have become a locus for centralized data storage and processing.</p><p>The privacy implications associated with the reliance on a central intermediary who can delete, control, or expose user data at any time have proven to be no small matter. New regulations such as <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a> and <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">CCPA</a> have brought user privacy to the forefront and have spurred lots of public discourse and pressure for companies to manage their data processing policies against more robust standards. The regulatory and business environment that is forming around GDPR and CCPA is pushing the market to consider better solutions that may involve decentralizing the mode of operation or separating the responsibilities of an&nbsp;IdP.</p><p>Identity Provider&nbsp;lock-in</p><p>Lastly, in today’s landscape there is an inseparable coupling between an End-User and the IdP they use. This effectively means that, in order to transfer from say “Sign In With Google” to “Sign In With Twitter,” a user often has to start over and build their identity from scratch. This is due to the fact that users are effectively borrowing or renting their identities from their IdPs, and hence have little to no control in exercising that identity how they see fit. This model creates a pattern that unnecessarily ties a user to the application and data ecosystem of their IdP and means they must keep an active account with the provider to keep using their identity. If a user can’t access to their account with an IdP, say by losing access to their Twitter profile, they can no longer login to any of the services where they’re using Twitter as their&nbsp;IdP.</p><p>One of the problems with the term Identity Provider itself is that it sets up the assumption that the end-user is being provided with an identity, rather than the identity being theirs or under their control. If end-users have no real choice in selecting their IdP, then they are ultimately subject to the whims of a few very large and powerful companies. This model is not only antithetical to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/06/technology/congress-big-tech-monopoly-power.html">anti-trust</a> policies and legislation, it also prevents data portability between platforms. It’s made it abundantly clear that the paradigm shift on end-user privacy practices needs to start by giving users a baseline level of choice when it comes to their identity.</p><p>A nod to an alternative model</p><p>Fundamentally, when it comes to identity on the web, users should have choice; choice about which services they employ to facilitate the usage of their digital identities along with being empowered to change these service providers if they so&nbsp;choose.</p><p>The irony of OpenID Connect is that the original authors did actually consider these problems, and evidence of this can be found in the original OIDC specification: in chapter 7, entitled “<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#SelfIssued">Self Issued OpenID Provider</a>” (SIOP).</p><p>Earning its name primarily from the powerful idea that users could somehow be their own identity provider, SIOP was an ambitious attempt at solving a number of different problems at once. It raises some major questions about the future of the protocol, but it stops short of offering an end-to-end solution to these complex problems.</p><p>As it stands in the core specification, the SIOP chapter of OIDC was really trying to solve 3 significant, but distinct problems, which&nbsp;are:</p>  Enabling portable/transferable identities between providers  Dealing with different deployment models for OpenID providers  Solving the <a href="https://indieweb.org/NASCAR_problem">Nascar&nbsp;Problem</a>  <p>SIOP has recently been of strong interest to those in the decentralized or self-sovereign identity community because it’s been identified as a <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/if-you-build-an-island-youll-need-a-boat-537f48525edc">potential pathway</a> to transitioning existing deployed digital infrastructure towards a more decentralized and user-centric model. As discussion is ongoing at the <a href="https://openid.net/foundation/">OpenID Foundation</a> to evolve and reboot the work around SIOP, there are a number of interesting questions raised by this chapter that are worth exploring to their full extent. For starters, SIOP questions some of the fundamental assumptions around the behaviour and deployment of an&nbsp;IdP.</p><p>OpenID and OAuth typically use a redirect mechanism to relay a request from a relying party to an IdP. OAuth supports redirecting back to a native app for the end-user, but it assumes that the provider itself always takes the form of an HTTP server, and furthermore it assumes the request is primarily handled server-side. SIOP challenged this assumption by questioning whether the identity provider has to be entirely server-side, or if the provider could instead take the form of a Single-Page Application (SPA), Progressive Web Application (PWA), or even a native application. In creating a precedent for improving upon the IdP model, SIOP was asking fundamental questions such as: who gets to pick the provider? What role does the end-user play in this selection process? Does the provider always need to be an authorization server or is there a more decentralized model available that is resilient from certain modes of compromise?</p><p>Although some of these questions remain unanswered or are early in development, the precedent set by SIOP has spurred a number of related developments in and around web identity. Work is ongoing at the OpenID Foundation to flesh out the implications of SIOP in the emerging landscape.</p><p>Tech giants capitalize on the conversation</p><p>Although OIDC is primarily a web-based identity protocol, it was purposefully designed to be independent of any particular browser feature or API. This separation of concerns has proved incredibly useful in enabling adoption of OIDC outside of web-only environments, but it has greatly limited the ability for browser vendors to facilitate and mediate web-based login events. A number of large technology and browser vendors have picked up on this discrepancy, and are starting to take ownership of the role they play in web-based user interactions.</p><p>Notably, a number of new initiatives have been introduced in the last few years to address this gap in user privacy on the web. An example of this can be found in the <a href="https://tag.w3.org/">W3C Technical Architecture Group</a> (TAG), a group tasked with documenting and building consensus around the architecture of the World Wide Web. Ahead of the 2019 <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/09/TPAC/">W3C TPAC</a> in Japan, Apple proposed an initiative called <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webappsec/2019Sep/0004.html">IsLoggedIn</a>, effectively a way for websites to tell the browser whether the user was logged in or not in a trustworthy way. What they realized is that the behavior of modern web architecture results in users being “logged in by default” to websites they visit, even if they only visit a website once. Essentially as soon as the browser loads a webpage, that page can store data about the user indefinitely on the device, with no clear mechanism for indicating when a user has logged out or wishes to stop sharing their data. They introduced an API that would allow browsers to set the status of user log-ins to limit long term storage of user data. It was a vision that required broad consensus among today’s major web browsers to be successful. Ultimately, the browsers have taken their own approach in trying to mitigate the&nbsp;issue.</p><p>In 2019, Google created their <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/chrome/building-a-more-private-web/">Privacy Sandbox</a> initiative to advance user privacy on the web using open and transparent standards. As one of the largest web browsers on the planet, Google Chrome seized the opportunity provided by an increased public focus on user privacy to work on limiting cross-site user tracking and pervasive incentives that encourage surveillance. Fuelled by the Privacy Sandbox initiative, they created a project called <a href="https://wicg.github.io/WebID/README.html">WebID</a> to explore how the browser can mediate between different parties in a digital identity transaction. WebID is an early attempt to get in the middle of the interaction that happens between a relying party and an IdP, allowing the browser to facilitate the transaction in a way that provides stronger privacy guarantees for the end-user.</p><p>As an overarching effort, it’s in many ways a response to the environment created by CCPA and GDPR where technology vendors like Google are attempting to enforce privacy expectations for end-users while surfing the web. Its goal is to keep protocols like OIDC largely intact while using the browser as a mediator to provide a stronger set of guarantees when it comes to user identities. This may ultimately give end-users more privacy on the web, but it doesn’t exactly solve the problem of users being locked into their IdPs. With the persistent problem of data portability and limited user choices, simply allowing the browser to mediate the interaction is an important piece of the puzzle but does not go far enough on its&nbsp;own.</p><p>Going beyond the current state of OpenID&nbsp;Connect</p><p>Though it is a critical component of modern web identity, OIDC is not by any means the only solution or protocol to attempt to solve these kinds of problems.</p><p>A set of emerging standards from the W3C Credentials Community Group aim to look at identity on the web in a very different way, and, in fact, are designed to consider use cases outside of just consumer identity. One such standard is <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers</a> (DIDs) which defines a new type of identifier and accompanying data model featuring several novel properties not present in most mainstream identifier schemes in use today. Using DIDs in tandem with technologies like <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> (VCs) creates an infrastructure for a more distributed and decentralized layer for identity on the web, enabling a greater level of user control. VCs were created as the newest in a long line of cryptographically secured data representation formats. Their goal was to provide a standard that improves on its predecessors by accommodating formal data semantics through technologies like JSON-LD and addressing the role of data subjects in managing and controlling data about themselves.</p><p>These standards have emerged in large part to address the limitations of federated identity systems such as the one provided by OIDC. In the case of DIDs, the focus has been on creating a more resilient kind of user-controllable identifier. These kinds of identifiers don’t have to be borrowed or rented from an IdP as is the case today, but can instead be directly controlled by the entities they represent via cryptography in a consistent and standard way. When combining these two technologies, VCs and DIDs, we enable verifiable information that has a cryptographic binding to the end-user and can be transferred cross-context while retaining its security and semantics.</p><p>As is the case with many emerging technologies, in order to be successful in an existing and complicated market, these new standards should have a cohesive relationship to the present. To that end, there has been a significant push to bridge these emerging technologies with the existing world of OIDC in a way that doesn’t break existing implementations and encourages interoperability.</p><p>One prominent example of this is a new extension to OIDC known as <a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/oidc-client-bound-assertions-spec/">OpenID Connect Credential Provider</a>. Current OIDC flows result in the user receiving an identity token which is coupled to the IdP that created it, and can be used to prove the user’s identity within a specific domain. OIDC Credential Provider allows you to extend OIDC to allow IdPs to issue reusable VCs about the end-user instead of simple identity tokens with limited functionality. It allows end-users to request credentials from an OpenID Provider and manage their own credentials in a <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/concepts/digital-wallets">digital wallet</a> under their control. By allowing data authorities to be the provider of reusable digital credentials instead of simple identity assertions, this extension effectively turns traditional Identity Providers into Credential Providers.</p><p>The credentials provided under this system are cryptographically bound to a public key controlled by the end-user. In addition to public key binding, the credential can instead be bound to a DID, adding a layer of indirection between a user’s identity and the keys they use to control it. In binding to a DID, the subject of the credential is able to maintain ownership of the credential on a longer life cycle due to their ability to manage and rotate keys while maintaining a consistent identifier. This eases the burden on data authorities to re-issue credentials when the subject’s keys change and allows relying parties to verify that the credential is always being validated against the current public key of the end-user. The innovations upon OIDC mark a shift from a model where relying parties request claims from an IdP, to one where they can request claims from specific issuers or according to certain <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/concepts/trust-frameworks">trust frameworks</a> and evaluation metrics appropriate to their use case. This kind of policy-level data management creates a much more predictable and secure way for businesses and people to get the data they&nbsp;need.</p><p>OIDC Credential Provider, a new spec at the OpenID Foundation, is challenging the notion that the identity that a user receives has to be an identity entirely bound to its domain. It offers traditional IdPs a way to issue credentials that are portable and can cross domains because the identity/identifier is no longer coupled to the provider as is the case with an identity token. <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/introducing-oidc-credential-provider-7845391a9881">This work</a> serves to further bridge the gap between existing digital identity infrastructure and emerging technologies which are more decentralized and user-centric. It sets the foundation for a deeper shift in how data is managed online, whether it comes in the form of identity claims, authorizations, or other kinds of <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/concepts/verifiable-data">verifiable data</a>.</p><p>Broadening the landscape of digital&nbsp;identity</p><p>OIDC, which is primarily used for identity, is built upon OAuth 2.0, whose primary use is authorization and access. If OIDC is about who the End-User is, then OAuth 2.0 is about what you’re allowed to do on behalf of and at the consent of the End-User. OAuth 2.0 was built prior to OIDC, in many ways because authorization allowed people to accomplish quite a bit without the capabilities of a formalized and standardized identity protocol. Eventually, it became obvious that identity is an integral and relatively well-defined cornerstone of web access that needed a simple solution. OIDC emerged as it increasingly became a requirement to know who the end-user (or resource owner) is and for the client to be able to request access to basic claims about them. Together, OIDC and OAuth2.0 create a protocol that combines authentication and authorization. While this allows them to work natively with one another, it’s not always helpful from an infrastructure standpoint to collapse these different functions together.</p><p>Efforts like WebID are currently trending towards the reseparation of these concepts that have become married in the current world of OpenID, by developing browser APIs that are specifically geared towards identity. However, without a solution to authorization, it could be argued that many of the goals of the project will remain unsatisfied whenever the relying party requires both authentication and authorization in a given interaction.</p><p>As it turns out, these problems are all closely related to each other and require a broad and coordinated approach. As we step into an increasingly digital era where the expectation continues to evolve around what’s possible to do online, the role of identity becomes increasingly complex. Take, for example, sectors such as the financial industry dealing with increased requirements around electronic Know-Your-Customer (KYC) policies. In parallel with the innovation around web identity and the adoption of emerging technologies such as VCs, there has been a growing realization that the evolution of digital identity enables many opportunities that extend far beyond the domain of identity. This is where the power of verifiable data on the web really begins, and with it an expanded scope and structure for how to build digital infrastructure that can support a whole new class of applications.</p><p>A new proposed browser API called <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/credential-handler-api/">Credential Handler API</a> (CHAPI) offers a promising solution to browser-mediated interactions that complements the identity-centric technologies of OIDC and WebID. It currently takes the form of a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Polyfill">polyfill</a> to allow these capabilities to be used in the browser today. Similar to how SIOP proposes for the user to be able pick their provider for identity-related credentials, CHAPI allows you to pick your provider, but not just for identity — for any kind of credential. In that sense, OIDC and CHAPI are solving slightly different problems:</p>  OIDC is primarily about requesting authentication of an End-User and receiving some limited identity claims about them, and in certain circumstances also accessing protected resources on their&nbsp;behalf.  CHAPI is about requesting credentials that may describe the End-user or may not. Additionally, credentials might not even be related to their identity directly and instead used for other related functions like granting authorization, access,&nbsp;etc.  <p>While OIDC offers a simple protocol based upon URL redirects, CHAPI pushes for a world of deeper integration with the browser that affords several useability benefits. Unlike traditional implementations of OIDC, CHAPI does not start with the assumption that an identity is fixed to the provider. Instead, the end-user gets to register their preferred providers in the browser and then select from this list when an interaction with their provider is required. Since CHAPI allows for exchanging credentials that may or may not be related to the end-user, it allows for a much broader set of interactions than what’s provided by today’s identity protocols. In theory, these can work together rather than as alternative options. You could, for instance, treat CHAPI browser APIs as a client to contact the end-user’s OpenID Provider and then use CHAPI to exchange and present additional credentials that may be under the end-user’s control.</p><p>CHAPI is very oriented towards the “credential” abstraction, which is essentially a fixed set of claims protected in a cryptographic envelope and often intended to be long lived. A useful insight from the development of OIDC is that it may be helpful to separate, at least logically, the presentation of identity-related information from the presentation of other kinds of information. To extend this idea, authenticating or presenting a credential is different from authenticating that you’re the subject of a credential. You may choose to do these things in succession, but they are not inherently related.</p><p>The reason this is important has to do with privacy, data hygiene, and best security practices. In order to allow users to both exercise their identity on the web and manage all of their credentials in one place, we should be creating systems that default to requesting specific information about an end-user as needed, not necessarily requesting credentials when what’s needed is an authentic identity and vice&nbsp;versa.</p><p>Adopting this kind of policy would allow configurations where the identifier for the credential subject would not be assumed to be the identifier used to identify the subject with the relying party. Using this capability in combination with approaches to <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/concepts/selective-disclosure">selective disclosure</a> like <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/a-solution-for-privacy-preserving-verifiable-credentials-f1650aa16093">VCs with JSON-LD BBS+ signatures</a> will ensure not only a coherent system that can separate identity and access, but also one that respects user privacy and provides a bridge between existing identity management infrastructure and emerging technologies.</p><p>An emergent user experience</p><p>Using these technologies in tandem also helps to bridge the divide between native and web applications when it comes to managing identity across different modalities. Although the two often get conflated, a digital wallet for holding user credentials is not necessarily an application. It’s a service to help users manage their credentials, both identity-related and otherwise, and should be accessible wherever an end-user needs to access it. In truth, native apps and web apps are each good at different things and come with their own unique set of trade-offs and implementation challenges. Looking at this emerging paradigm where identity is managed in a coherent way across different types of digital infrastructure, “web wallets” and “native wallets” are not necessarily mutually exclusive — emerging technologies can leverage redirects to allow the use of&nbsp;both.</p><p>The revolution around digital identity offers a new paradigm that places users in a position of greater control around their digital interactions, giving them the tools to exercise agency over their identity and their data online. Modern legislation focused on privacy, portability, security and accessible user experience is also creating an impetus for the consolidation of legacy practices. The opportunity is to leverage this directional shift to create a network effect across the digital ecosystem, making it easier for relying parties to build secure web experiences and unlocking entirely new value opportunities for claims providers and data authorities.</p><p>Users shouldn’t have to manage the complexity left behind by today’s outdated identity systems, and they shouldn’t be collateral damage when it comes to designing convenient apps and services. Without careful coordination, much of the newer innovation could lead to even more fragmentation in the digital landscape. However, as we can see here, many of these technology efforts and standards are solving similar or complementary problems.</p><p>Ultimately, a successful reinvention of identity on the web should make privacy and security easy; easy for end-users to understand, easy for relying parties to support, and easy for providers to implement. That means building bridges across technologies to support not only today’s internet users, but enabling access to an entirely new set of stakeholders across the globe who will finally have a seat at the table, such as those without access to the internet or readily available web infrastructure. As these technologies develop, we should continue to push for consolidation and simplicity to strike the elusive balance between security and convenience across the ecosystem for everyday&nbsp;users.</p><p>Where to from&nbsp;here?</p><p>Solving the challenges necessary to realize the future state of identity on the web will take a collective effort of vendor collaboration, standards contributions, practical implementations and education. In order to create adoption of this technology at scale, we should consider the following as concrete next steps we can all take to bring this vision to&nbsp;life:</p><p>Continue to drive development of bridging technologies that integrate well with existing identity solutions and provide a path to decentralized and portable&nbsp;identity</p>  E.g. formalization of OIDC Credential Provider to extend existing&nbsp;IdPs  <p>Empower users to exercise autonomy and sovereignty in selecting their service provider, as well as the ability to change providers and manage services over&nbsp;time</p>  E.g. selection mechanisms introduced by SIOP and&nbsp;WebID  <p>Adopt a holistic approach to building solutions that recognizes the role of browser-mediated interactions in preserving user&nbsp;privacy</p>  E.g. newer browser developments such as CHAPI and&nbsp;WebID  <p>Build solutions that make as few assumptions as necessary in order to support different types of deployment environments that show up in real-world use&nbsp;cases</p>  E.g. evolution of SIOP as well as supporting web and native&nbsp;wallets  <p>Ensure that the development of decentralized digital identity supports the variety and diversity of data that may be managed by users in the future, whether that data be identity-related or otherwise</p><p>Taking these steps will help to ensure that the identity technologies we build to support the digital infrastructure of tomorrow will avoid perpetuating the inequalities and accessibility barriers we face today. By doing our part to collaborate and contribute to solutions that work for everybody, building bridges rather than building siloes, we can create a paradigm shift that has longevity and resilience far into the future. We hope you join&nbsp;us.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/the-state-of-identity-on-the-web-cffc392bc7ea">The State of Identity on the Web</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Reading a collection of John McPhee stories, I found several that were new to me. <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1993/06/28/duty-of-care">The Duty of Care</a>, published in the New Yorker in 1993, is about tires, and how we do or don’t properly recycle them. One form of reuse we’ve mostly abandoned is retreads. McPhee writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>A retread is in no way inferior to a new tire, but new tires are affordable, and the retreaded passenger tire has descended to the status of a clip-on tie.</p></blockquote>
<p>My dad wore clip-on ties. He also used retreaded tires, and I can remember visiting a shop on several occasions to have the procedure done.</p>
<p>Recently I asked a friend: “Whatever happened to retreaded tires?” We weren’t sure, but figured they’d gone away for good reasons: safety, reliability. But maybe not. <a href="https://www.tirerecappers.com/how-does-retread-work/">TireRecappers</a> and <a href="https://www.treadwright.com/pages/retread-moldcure-manufacturing">TreadWright</a> don’t buy those arguments. Maybe retreads were always a viable option for our passenger fleet, as they still are for our truck fleet. And maybe, with better tech, they’re better than they used to be.</p>
<p>In Duty of Care, McPhee tells the story of the Modesto pile. It was, at the time, the world’s largest pile of scrap tires containing, by his estimate, 34 million tires.</p>
<blockquote><p>You don’t have to stare long at that pile before the thought occurs to you that those tires were once driven upon by the Friends of the Earth. They are Environmental Defense Fund tires, Rainforest Action Network tires, Wilderness Society tires. They are California Natural Resources Federation tires, Save San Francisco Bay Association tires, Citizens for a Better Environment tires. They are Greenpeace tires, Sierra Club tires, Earth Island Institute tires. They are Earth First! tires!</p></blockquote>
<p>(I love a good John McPhee list.)</p>
<p>The world’s largest pile of tires left a surprisingly small online footprint, but you can find the LA Times’ <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-11-30-mn-16908-story.html">Massive Pile of Tires Fuels Controversial Energy Plan</a> which describes the power plant — 41 million dollars, 14 megawatts, “the first of its kind in the United States and the largest in the world” — that McPhee visited when researching his story. I found it on Google Maps by following McPhee’s directions.</p>
<blockquote><p>If you were abandon your car three miles from the San Joaquin County line and make your way on foot southwest one mile…</p></blockquote>
<p>You can see the power plant. There’s no evidence of tires, or trucks moving them, so maybe the plant, having consumed the pile, is retired. Fortunately it never caught fire, that would’ve made a hell of a mess.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tire_recycling">Wikipedia</a>, we’ve reduced our inventory of stockpiled tires by an order of magnitude from a peak of a billion around the time McPhee wrote that article. We burn most of them for energy, and turn some into ground rubber for such uses as paving and flooring. So that’s progress. But I can’t help but wonder about the tire equivalent of Amory Lovins’ <a href="https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/energy-efficiency/whats-a-negawatt">negawatt</a>: “A watt of energy that you have not used through energy conservation or the use of energy-efficient products.”</p>
<p>Could retreaded passenger tires be an important source of negawatts? Do we reject the idea just because they’re as unfashionable as clip-on ties? I’m no expert on the subject, obviously, but I suspect these things might be true.</p>

<p>みなさん、フランスの２０世紀の作曲家、ダマーズの「フルート、オーボエ、クラリネットとピアノのための四重奏」をご存知でしょうか？いかにもフランスという洒脱な曲です。リンクを貼ったのは二楽章ですが、ダマーズはこれに限らず第二楽章に楽しいものがおおいです。</p>



<p>ダマーズはコルトーの弟子で、フォーレのノクチュルヌとバルカローレの全曲録音を最初にした人でもあります。</p>



<p>新古典主義の作曲だったので20世紀にはあまり評価されていませんでしたが、最近評価が上がってきて録音も手に入るようになってきています。いかにもフランス的。プーランクが好きだったらダマーズも好きだと思います。</p>

<p>On March 9, The Vienna Digital Identity Meetup* hosted presentations from Xavier Vila, Product Manager for Validated ID and Dr. Ignacio Alamillo, Director of Astrea on eIDAS and Self Sovereign Identity.  The presentations covered the technical, legal and business dimensions of bridging between eIDAS and SSI concepts and increasing the value and usability of digital identity in the European model.</p><p>A key component of the Digital Europe architecture is the existence of a trusted and secure digital identity infrastructure.  This journey was started in 2014 with the implementation of the eIDAS Regulation.  As has been discussed in previous Vienna Digital Identity Meetups, a high assurance digital identity is the key piece connecting the physical and digital worlds, and this piece was not included in the initial creation of our digital world.</p><p>Why then is eIDAS v1 not seen as a success?  There are many reasons; from parts of the regulation that focused or constrained its use into the public sphere only, to the lack of total coverage across all of the EU.  Likely the key missing piece was that the cultural climate was not yet ripe and the state of digital identity was really not ready.  Too many technical problems were yet to be solved. Without these elements the realized state of eIDAS should not be unexpected.  All this said, eIDAS v1 laid very important groundwork and created an environment to gather important learnings to allow eIDAS v2 to realize the hoped for levels of success and adoption.</p><p>Validated ID has been developing a eIDAS - ESSIF bridge bringing the eIDAS trust seals to Verifiable Credentials.  As a  Qualified Trust Service Provider under the eIDAS, Validated ID has been offering trust services to customers across Europe since 2012.  Xavier presented this current work and provides a detailed explanation on how the eIDAS-SSI bridge applies the qualified electronic seals to Verifiable Credentials.</p><p>Dr. Alamillo further clarified the importance of the eIDAS-SSI Bridge in his presentation on SSI in the eIDAS Regulation.  When a Qualified Electronic Seal is applied to a Verifiable Credential the combined document becomes a legal document with cross border legal value within the EU.  Currently in an identity context, eIDAS is the European wide identity meta system, providing the framework for the 27 nation states of the EU to operate as a very large federated identity network.  However, the point was raised the in the current ongoing revision of the eIDAS regulation, it is possible that handling of electronic identification may be changed from a ‘connecting of services’ to a new trust service.</p><p><br></p><p>To listen to a recording of the event please check out the link: <a href="https://vimeo.com/522501200">https://vimeo.com/522501200</a></p><p>Time markers: </p>  <p>0:00:00 - Introduction </p>  <p>0:04:00 - Xavier Vila, Validated ID </p>  <p>0:34:00 - Questions </p>  <p>0:42:00 - Dr. Ignacio Alamillo, Astrea </p>  <p>1:18:00 - Questions </p>  <p>1:28:00 - Wrap-up &amp; Upcoming Events  </p>  <p>Resources</p><p>SSI - eIDAS Bridge GitHub Repo - <a href="https://github.com/validatedid/ssi-eidas-bridge/">https://github.com/validatedid/ssi-eidas-bridge/</a></p><p>Xavier Vila’s Presentation Deck: <a href="https://www.thedinglegroup.com/s/210308-Vienna-Identity-Meetup-SSI-eIDAS-Bridge.pdf">Vale-SSI-EIDAS Bridge.pdf<br>Nach</a>o Alamillo’s Presentation Deck: <a href="https://www.thedinglegroup.com/s/Vienna-digital-identity-event-eIDAS-Alamillo.pdf">Alamillo-SSI-EIDAS.pdf</a></p><p>And as a reminder,  we continue to have online only events. </p><p>If interested in getting notifications of upcoming events please join the event group at: https://www.meetup.com/Vienna-Digital-Identity-Meetup/ </p><p>*The Vienna Digital Identity Meetup is hosted by The Dingle Group and is focused on educating business, societal, legal and technologists on the new opportunities that arise with  a high assurance digital identity created by the reduction risk and strengthened provenance.

<p>For 20 bucks or less, nowadays, you can buy an extra-wide convex mirror that clips onto your car’s existing rear-view mirror. We just tried one for the first time, and I’m pretty sure it’s a keeper. These gadgets claim to eliminate blind spots, and this one absolutely does. Driving down 101, I counted three seconds as a car passed through my driver’s-side blind spot. That’s a long time when you’re going 70 miles per hour; during that whole time I could see that passing car in the extended mirror.</p>
<p>Precious few gadgets spark joy for me. This one had me at hello. Not having to turn your head, avoiding the risk of not turning your head — these are huge benefits, quite possibly life-savers. For 20 bucks!</p>
<p>It got even better. As darkness fell, we wondered how it would handle approaching headlights. It’s not adjustable like the stock mirror, but that turns out not to be a problem. The mirror dims those headlights so they’re easy to look at. The same lights in the side mirrors are blinding by comparison.</p>
<p>I’ve been driving more than 40 years. This expanded view could have been made available at any point along the way. There’s nothing electronic or digital. It’s just a better idea that combines existing ingredients in a new way. That pretty much sums up my own approach to product development.</p>
<p>Finally, there’s the metaphor. Seeing around corners is a superpower I’ve always wanted. I used to love taking photos with the fisheye lens on my dad’s 35mm Exacta, now I love making panoramic views with my phone. I hate being blindsided, on the road and in life, by things I can’t see coming. I hate narrow-mindedness, and always reach for a wider view.</p>
<p>I’ll never overcome all my blind spots but it’s nice to chip away at them. After today, there will be several fewer to contend with.</p>

<p>The column republished below, originally at <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/network/2005/04/22/primetime.html">http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/network/2005/04/22/primetime.html</a>, was the vector that connected me to my dear friend Gardner Campbell. I’m resurrecting it here partly just to bring it back online, but mainly to celebrate the ways in which Gardner — a film scholar among many other things — is, right now, bringing his film expertise to the practice of online teaching. </p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.gardnercampbell.net/blog1/?p=3106">this post</a> he reflects:</p>
<blockquote><p>Most of the learning spaces I’ve been in provide very poorly, if at all, for the supposed magic of being co-located. A state-mandated prison-spec windowless classroom has less character than a well-lighted Zoom conference. A lectern with a touch-pad control for a projector-and-screen combo is much less flexible and, I’d argue, conveys much less human connection and warmth than I can when I share a screen on Zoom during a synchronous class, or see my students there, not in front of a white sheet of reflective material, but in the medium with me, lighting up the chat, sharing links, sharing the simple camaraderie of a hearty “good morning” as class begins.</p></blockquote>
<p>And in <a href="http://www.gardnercampbell.net/blog1/?p=3096">this one</a> he shares the <a href="https://youtu.be/82Gu4BKagpI">course trailer</a> (!) for Fiction into film: a study of adaptations of “Little Women”.</p>
<p>My 2005 column was a riff on a New York Times article, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/06/movies/is-a-cinema-studies-degree-the-new-mba.html">Is Cinema Studies the new MBA</a>? It was perhaps a stretch, in 2005, to argue for cinema studies as an integral part of the new freshman comp. The argument makes a lot more sense now.</p>
 
 The New Freshman Comp 
<p>For many years I have alternately worn two professional hats: writer and programmer. Lately I find myself wearing a third hat: filmmaker. When I began making the films that I now call screencasts, my readers and I both sensed that this medium was different enough to justify the new name that we collaboratively gave it. Here’s how I define the difference. Film is a genre of storytelling that addresses the whole spectrum of human experience. Screencasting is a subgenre of film that can tell stories about the limited — but rapidly growing — slice of our lives that is mediated by software.</p>
<p>Telling stories about software in this audiovisual way is something I believe technical people will increasingly want to do. To explain why, let’s first discuss a more ancient storytelling mode: writing.</p>
<p>The typical reader of this column is probably, like me, a writer of both prose and code. Odds are you identify yourself as a coder more than as a writer. But you may also recently have begun blogging, in which case you’ve seen your writing muscles grow stronger with exercise.</p>
<p>Effective writing and effective coding are more closely related than you might think. Once upon a time I spent a year as a graduate student and teaching assistant at an Ivy League university. My program of study was science writing, but that was a tiny subspecialty within a larger MFA (master of fine arts) program dedicated to creative writing. That’s what they asked me to teach, and the notion terrified me. I had no idea what I’d say to a roomful of aspiring poets and novelists. As it turned out, though, many of these kids were in fact aspiring doctors, scientists, and engineers who needed humanities credits. So I decided to teach basic expository writing. The university’s view was that these kids had done enough of that in high school. Mine was that they hadn’t, not by a long shot.</p>
<p>I began by challenging their reverence for published work. Passages from books and newspapers became object lessons in editing, a task few of my students had ever been asked to perform in a serious way. They were surprised by the notion that you could improve material that had been professionally written and edited, then sold in bookstores or on newsstands. Who were they to mess with the work of the pros?</p>
<p>I, in turn, was surprised to find this reverent attitude even among the budding software engineers. They took it for granted that programs were imperfect texts, always subject to improvement. But they didn’t see prose in the same way. They didn’t equate refactoring a program with editing a piece of writing, as I did then and still do.</p>
<p>When I taught this class more than twenty years ago the term “refactoring” wasn’t commonly applied to software. Yet that’s precisely how I think about the iterative refinement of prose and of code. In both realms, we adjust vocabulary to achieve consistency of tone, and we transform structure to achieve economy of expression.</p>
<p>I encouraged my students to regard writing and editing as activities governed by engineering principles not unlike the ones that govern coding and refactoring. Yes, writing is a creative act. So is coding. But in both cases the creative impulse is expressed in orderly, calculated, even mechanical ways. This seemed to be a useful analogy. For technically-inclined students earning required humanities credits, it made the subject seem more relevant and at the same time more approachable.</p>
<p>In the pre-Internet era, none of us foresaw the explosive growth of the Internet as a textual medium. If you’d asked me then why a programmer ought to be able to write effectively, I’d have pointed mainly to specs and manuals. I didn’t see that software development was already becoming a global collaboration, that email and newsgroups were its lifeblood, and that the ability to articulate and persuade in the medium of text could be as crucial as the ability to design and build in the medium of code.</p>
<p>Nowadays, of course, software developers have embraced new tools of articulation and persuasion: blogs, wikis. I’m often amazed not only by the amount of writing that goes on in these forms, but also by its quality. Writing muscles do strengthen with exercise, and the game of collaborative software development gives them a great workout.</p>
<p>Not everyone drinks equally from this fountain of prose, though. Developers tend to write a great deal for other developers, but much less for those who use their software. Laziness is a factor; hubris even more so. We like to imagine that our software speaks for itself. And in some ways that’s true. Documentation is often only a crutch. If you have to explain how to use your software, you’ve failed.</p>
<p>It may, however, be obvious how to use a piece of software, and yet not at all obvious why to use it. I’ll give you two examples: Wikipedia and del.icio.us. Anyone who approaches either of these applications will immediately grasp their basic modes of use. That’s the easy part. The hard part is understanding what they’re about, and why they matter.</p>
<p>A social application works within an environment that it simultaneously helps to create. If you understand that environment, the application makes sense. Otherwise it can seem weird and pointless.</p>
<p>Paul Kedrosky, an investor, academic, and columnist, alluded to this problem on his blog last month:</p>
<blockquote><p>Funny conversation I had with someone yesterday: We agreed that the thing that generally made us both persevere and keep trying any new service online, even if we didn’t get it the first umpteen times, was having Jon Udell post that said service was useful. After all, if Jon liked it then it had to be that we just hadn’t tried hard enough. [<a href="http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/001115.html">Infectious Greed</a>]</p></blockquote>
<p>I immodestly quote Paul’s remarks in order to revise and extend them. I agree that the rate-limiting factor for software adoption is increasingly not purchase, or installation, or training, but simply “getting it.” And while I may have a good track record for “getting it,” plenty of other people do too — the creators of new applications, obviously, as well as the early adopters. What’s unusual about me is the degree to which I am trained, inclined, and paid to communicate in ways that help others to “get it.”</p>
<p>We haven’t always seen the role of the writer and the role of the developer as deeply connected but, as the context for understanding software shifts from computers and networks to people and groups, I think we’ll find that they are. When an important application’s purpose is unclear on the first umpteen approaches, and when “getting it” requires hard work, you can’t fix the problem with a user-interface overhaul or a better manual. There needs to be an ongoing conversation about what the code does and, just as importantly, why. Professional communicators (like me) can help move things along, but everyone needs to participate, and everyone needs to be able to communicate effectively.</p>
<p>If you’re a developer struggling to evangelize an idea, I’d start by reiterating that your coding instincts can also help you become a better writer. Until recently, that’s where I’d have ended this essay too. But recent events have shown me that writing alone, powerful though it can be, won’t necessarily suffice.</p>
<p>I’ve written often — and, I like to think, cogently — about wikis and tagging. But my screencasts about Wikipedia and del.icio.us have had a profoundly greater impact than anything I’ve written on these topics. People “get it” when they watch these movies in ways that they otherwise don’t.</p>
<p>It’s undoubtedly true that an audiovisual narrative enters many 21st-century minds more easily, and makes a more lasting impression on those minds, than does a written narrative. But it’s also true that the interactive experience of software is fundamentally cinematic in nature. Because an application plays out as a sequence of frames on a timeline, a narrated screencast may be the best possible way to represent it and analyze it.</p>
<p>If you buy either or both of these explanations, what then? Would I really suggest that techies will become fluid storytellers not only in the medium of the written essay, but also in the medium of the narrated screencast? Actually, yes, I would, and I’m starting to find people who want to take on the challenge.</p>
<p>A few months ago I heard from Michael Tiller, who describes himself as a “mechanical engineer trapped in a computer scientist’s body.” Michael has had a long and passionate interest in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.modelica.com/">Modelica</a>, an open, object-oriented language for modeling mechanical, electrical, electronic, hydraulic, thermal, and control systems. He wanted to work with me to develop a screencast on this topic. But it’s far from my domains of expertise and, in the end, all he really needed was my encouragement. This week, Michael launched a website called&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dynopsys.com/">Dynopsis.com</a>&nbsp;that’s chartered to explore the intersection of engineering and information technologies. Featured prominently on the site is&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dynopsys.com/?q=modelica_screencast">this 20-minute screencast</a>&nbsp;in which he illustrates the use of Modelica in the context of the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dynasim.se/">Dymola</a>&nbsp;IDE.</p>
<p>This screencast was made with Windows Media Encoder 9, and without the help of any editing. After a couple of takes, Michael came up with a great overview of the Modelica language, the Dymola tool, and the modeling and simulation techniques that they embody. Since he is also author of a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0792373677">book</a>&nbsp;on this subject, I asked Michael to reflect on these different narrative modes, and here’s how he responded on his blog:</p>
<blockquote><p>If I were interested in teaching someone just the textual aspects of the Modelica language,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-form/104-0719698-6919906">this is exactly the approach I would take</a>.<br>
…<br>
But when trying to teach or explain a medium that is visual, other tools can be much more effective. Screencasts are one technology that could really make an impact on the way some subjects are taught and I can see how these ideas could be extended much further. [<a href="http://www.dynopsys.com/?q=node/19">Dynopsis: Learning by example: screencasts</a>]</p></blockquote>
<p>We’re just scratching the surface of this medium. Its educational power is immediately obvious, and over time its persuasive power will come into focus too. The New York Times recently asked: “Is cinema studies the new MBA?” I’ll go further and suggest that these methods ought to be part of the new freshman comp. Writing and editing will remain the foundation skills they always were, but we’ll increasingly combine them with speech and video. The tools and techniques are new to many of us. But the underlying principles — consistency of tone, clarity of structure, economy of expression, iterative refinement — will be familiar to programmers and writers alike.</p>

<p>We’ve been here 6 years, and the magical Sonoma County landscape just keeps growing on me. I’ve written about the spectacular coastline, a national treasure just twenty miles to our west that’s pristine thanks to the efforts of a handful of environmental activists, notably <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2019/07/21/walking-the-kortum-trail/">Bill Kortum</a>. Even closer, just ten miles to our east, lies the also spectacular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayacamas_Mountains">Mayacamas range</a> where today I again hiked Bald Mountain in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugarloaf_Ridge_State_Park">Sugarloaf Ridge State Park</a>.</p>
<p>If you ever visit this region and fancy a hike with great views, this is the one. (Ping me and I’ll go with you at the drop of a hat.) It’s not too challenging. The nearby Goodspeed Trail, leading up to Gunsight Notch on Hood Mountain, is more demanding, and in the end, less rewarding. Don’t get me wrong, the view from Gunsight — looking west over the Sonoma Valley and the Santa Rosa plain — is delightful. But the view from the top of Bald Mountain is something else again. On a clear day (which is most of them) you can spin a slow 360 and take in the Napa Valley towns of St. Helena and Calistoga to the west, Cobb and St. Helena mountains to the north, the Sonoma Valley and Santa Rosa plain to the east, then turn south to see Petaluma, Mt. Tamalpais, the top of the Golden Gate bridge, San Francisco, the San Pablo Bay, the tops of the tallest buildings in Oakland, and Mt. Diablo 51 miles away. Finally, to complete the loop, turn east again to look at the Sierra Nevada range 130 miles away.</p>
    
<p>The rugged topography you can see in that video occurs fractally everywhere around here. It’s taken a while to sink in, but I think I can finally explain what’s so fascinating about this landscape. It’s the sightlines. From almost anywhere, you’re looking at a 3D puzzle. I’m a relative newcomer, but I hike with friends who’ve lived their whole lives here, and from any given place, they are as likely as I am to struggle to identify some remote landmark. Everything looks different from everywhere. You’re always seeing multiple overlapping planes receding into the distance, like dioramas. And they change dramatically as you move around even slightly. Even just ten paces in any direction, or a slight change in elevation, can alter the sightlines completely and reveal or hide a distant landmark.</p>
<p>We’ve lived in flat places, we’ve lived in hilly places, but never until now in such a profoundly three-dimensional landscape. It is a blessing I will never take for granted.</p>

<p>An idea has been maturing in my thoughts for a while now. Or rather I have been thinking about a series of ideas, programming projects I would love to actualise, which I recently realised share a common thread. Memory and how we access it. Probably not surprising for software developers, pretty much any application we can imagine requires some form of data store. Although rarely, in my experience, do we talk about this data in terms of memory.</p>
<p>My more recent work researching identity, privacy and trust in digital interactions has evolved and broadened my perspective on the importance of memory. Our identity, whatever we conceive that to be, must be understood to exist in close relation to memory. Or the mathematician in me wants to say as a function of memory I ~ F(m) <a>1</a>. And as Herbert Simon details in the Science of the Artificial, memory is a key property of any intelligent system <a>2</a>.  The ability to take information from the past and apply it when navigating the present moment is a powerful skill in the Homo Sapien toolbox, both as individuals and a species.</p>
<p>These patterns of thought on memory percolating in my mind have further been influenced through my engagement with blockchain/distributed ledger both as a concept and through the practical application of it in application development. I especially find the ideas coming out of the Ethereum community transformative to the possibilities for digital application design. Persistent Compute Objects (PICOs) <a>3</a> are a more recent idea and open source project I have been following that appears to support novel interaction patterns.</p>
<p>It has been an interesting journey to this point, what follows in a sketch of the evolution of my thoughts on memory told through the lens of three ideas and the questions these ideas sparked in me. Then I intend to reflect on where my thoughts are at now, because it is only now reflecting on these ideas that I see the common thread - human memory. </p>
<p>The ideas that influenced my thinking and help illustrate my thoughts are; Viewing Time, The Community Mind and Nifty Books. Each originates at a different point in my life but all were ideas for programming side projects I could use to cut my teeth on a new technology, language or library. Each idea has a special place in my own memory, and it is from these memories that the thoughts I am sharing emerged.</p>
 Viewing Time 
<p>My first idea, back before I knew how to program. The inspirational carrot I used to motivate myself to learn. Not that I ever wrote more than a few lines of code on this. It originates from a time in Maastricht visiting a friend, we were sitting looking at a beautiful view and I thought: </p>
 What if we could create a timelapse of a view from a specific location? A View of Time. 
<p>I think I tried to get my friend to go back their every day to take a photo to do just this. Not the ideal solution, my thinking has evolved since then. Here are some of the questions I thought about:</p>
 
 
<p>What if we could crowd source the collection of the photos for a view, enabling anyone with a camera to contribute?</p>
 
 How would view’s of time be discovered, found, contributed to and viewed? 
 
<p>How would you prevent “bad” view from being added. Inappropriate, non valued, etc?</p>
 
 Who decides what a “bad” view is? 
 Authorisation problem 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Where would views be stored?</p>
 
 Who stores them? 
 Who has control over them? 
 Who manages that control? 
 
 
 Who would host and pay for this application and why? 
 
<p>How might Viewing Time change our relationship with our environment and help us reflect on the change happening all around us?</p>
 
 Chasing Ice, a documentary I watched on another visit to the Netherlands, emphasised how powerful this could be. <a href="https://earthvisioninstitute.org/share-this/columbia-glacier-alaska/">Here is an example</a>. 
 Watching a Chinese cityscape evolve over these last 20 years would have provided another staggering view of time and change. 
 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/mar/21/timelapse-satellite-images-china-fastest-growing-cities">Here are some examples of this using satellite imagery</a> 
 How might Viewing Time help communities record and interact with shared memories? 
 I was recently involved with planting a Community Orchard and became aware how valuable creating a view as a shared artifact could be. It might help communities celebrate and appreciate the positive changes they bring about. 
 
 
 How might date, time or season be used to present different time-lapses of the same view? 
 
<p>How would we prevent overtourism?</p>
 
 I never wanted to turn view’s into used and abused tourist spaces, an acknowledged tension. 
 Explicitly want to avoid insta tourism type effects. How?  
 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Trs-isdu4eE">This is a funny add from the Kiwi’s recently keeping me mindful of this</a> 
 What are the incentives? 
 How do we ensure this is an artifact all can enjoy while minimising the unintended consequences associated with the change in context-relative informational norms? 
 How might this be used to create incentives for positive, respectful tourism? 
 Realised in part this is about how views are discovered. 
 This got me closer to the importance of location. 
 
 
 
<p>What if you could only discover view’s if you were in it’s location?</p>
 
 How might this help to prevent bad content? 
 How would you even prove you were in a certain location? 
 Who/what would you prove it to? 
 
 
 
<p>What is the context and associated informational norms with a View?</p>
 
 Who defines and evolves these norms? 
 What are the rules? 
 
 
 How might location be used as a strong authenticator?<a>4</a> 
 
<p>These are all pointers, sketching the outlines of thought that I have been evolving over the 5 or so years since first appeared in my mind. </p>
<p>It is an idea that I never made any meaningful, tangible progress on. Except for a few positive conversations with friends it has remained wishful thinking. It is in my humble opinion, a beauty of an idea, something that I would love to see happen. I am optimistic, the technology and mental model for application design is shifting in ways that open up an entirely new design space for these kinds of ideas. Something other than the for profit venture capitalist endeavours that have lead to the colonisation and privatisation of much of our virtual spaces. A for-profit venture could never be the best realisation of this idea.</p>
 The Community Mind 
<p>
      <a>
    
  
  </a>
    </p>
<p>This is my baby. My first <a href="https://wip-abramson.dev/sideproject">side project</a>. It is how I learnt React and felt the power of GraphQl. The first website and server I ever deployed - a challenging experience but one I <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/lessons-learned-from-deploying-my-first-full-stack-web-application-34f94ec0a286/">learnt from</a>.  It is was also my first encounter with authentication and account management, what a nightmare that was.</p>
<p>After completing a year in industry this was the next programming project I worked on. I committed a lot of my time to this work. Including spending a month straight on it while dipping my toes into the digital nomad lifestyle in Chiang Mai, where I was exposed to and became fascinated with blockchain, Bitcoin and all that crazy stuff. An influential period of my life really. </p>
<p>Anyway, the idea revolves around creating a place for us to organise our questions. A space for questions to be shared and thought about, but not a place to collect answers. In my mind it was explicitly not for answers. Rather it would provide triggers to thought’s within individuals as they pondered these questions from the their own unique perspective shaped by their lived experience. I am a strong believe that we all have the ability to imagine creative ideas and possibilities, the hard part of course is actioning those ideas. As in many ways this text demonstrates.</p>
<p>The initial inspiration for this idea came from the book <a href="https://amorebeautifulquestion.com/">A More Beautiful Question</a>. I wanted to try to develop something that would make it easier to ask and discover beautiful questions. A place where these questions could be crowd sourced, recorded and connected.  I wanted to provide an interface for individuals to explore a web of interconnected questions being thought by others. I wanted people to be able to contribute their own questions and thought pathways to this network. Each individual interacting with and contributing to the community mind.</p>
<p>The questions that surfaced when thinking through the design requirements of such a project were something along these lines:</p>
 
 
<p>How will I manage questioners?</p>
 
 I was still thinking in a user account paradigm in these days.  
 Who gets to ask questions? 
 Who gets to see the questions asked? 
 
 
 
<p>How will questioners search and discover the questions they are interested in?</p>
 
 What if questions could be linked to other questions? 
 Who can link questions to other questions? Which links do people see and how do they decide? 
 What if these links grew in strength the more they were traversed and endorsed like neural pathways in our own minds? 
 
 
 
<p>How will we prevent duplicate questions?</p>
 
 Am I trying to create a single global repository of questions?  
 
<p>Or would it be better to allow each individual to manage their web of questions independently?</p>
 
 How might you enable the best of both? 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>How will we prevent bad data? Questions that don’t align with the ethos of the mind?</p>
 
 Whose mind? Who decides? 
 How might questions be optimally curated? 
 What is optimal and who is curating? 
 
 
 Where would this information be stored?  
 
<p>What is the business model for such an application?</p>
 
 What are the incentives? 
 
 
 
<p>When initially developing this project I had in mind a database for storing questions and their links, which people would interact with. Searching and filtering to discover the questions they were interested in. Contributing their own questions and connections to this storage. All managed by some centralised application, providing a single view and interface for people to interact with. Today, I have a model of individual’s being able to maintain their own mind, curating the questions and connections that find useful to them. Then providing a mechanism to network and aggregate the minds of others into a larger web of questions for all to explore. Imagine a mind like a GitHub repository, the entity that creates it would be able to manage the rules governing how questions and links are contributed. I even considered private minds as a potential business model. Although my desire was and remains today to develop an open source tool for recording, curating and discovering beautiful questions. I see them as a loose scaffold around thought, hinting at the problem space without prescribing the solution. A common entry point to creativity, that any individual from any background at any moment in time would be able to interact with. Using their own unique perspective to draw new insights and inspire different solutions.</p>
<p>I have a lot of fond memories developing this idea, including a weekend in Porto visiting a friend where I discovered the joy and value of committing thoughts to paper. Creating a physical artifact to interact with. Something that in my view can never fully be replicated in a digital medium, but what if you could have both?</p>

<p>Towards the end of my <a href="https://github.com/wip-abramson/TheCommunityMind">active development</a> of this idea I attempted to integrate a token, Simple Token, as part of a challenge they held. My idea at the time was to use this as some form of incentive mechanism for the application, although the actual execution was a bit clumsy looking back. You can view my submission <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMABXKGoiAk&amp;t=1s">here</a>. Then there is this old <a href="https://github.com/Blockternship/projects/issues/5">Github issue</a> from a month long hackathon called Blockternship. </p>
<p>While development is dormant, I am still very committed to making this a thing. One day!</p>
 Nifty Books 
<p>This is another lovely idea, in my book at least. Originating from my desire to learn how to write smart contracts using solidity, the Ethereum programming language. The idea stemmed from thinking through how we might digitally represent books the books we own, creating a distributed library and opening access to a wealth of books. Moving them off our shelves and into peoples hands, helping the wisdom held within them diffuse into more peoples minds and become recorded in their memories. Book’s can provide an intoxicating fountain of knowledge or a refreshing escape from reality. I appreciate both aspects equally and would love more to experience their joy. </p>
<p>For a bit of history of this idea you can see <a href="https://github.com/ethberlin-hackathon/ETHBerlin-Teambuilding/issues/23">my proposal</a> for the ETH Berlin hackathon around this. I proposed creating an application that allowed anyone to mint an <a href="http://erc721.org/">ERC721 Non-Fungible Token</a> to represent their physical book. Unfortunately, I ended up forming a different team and haven’t made much progress on realising this idea. I remain a sketchy solidity developer at best. That said, progress has been made. The concept is more mature in my mind, and the ethereum development landscape has come a long way since 2018. As my recent experience at the virtual <a href="https://www.ethdenver.com/">ETH Denver</a> highlighted, while I didn’t manage to submit anything or even write much code I did get a sense for how far things have come. The <a href="https://github.com/austintgriffith/scaffold-eth">scaffold-eth</a> repo seems like a great place to start, if I ever do manage to carve out time to create this.</p>
<p>I am convinced, and regularly reminded, how this idea could unlock so much hidden value. Book’s deserve to be read more than once, indeed there is something beautiful about a book having been read by many different people. Throughout the course of my studies in Edinburgh I have developed a fairly extensive personal collection of some truly fascinating books. I would love to have a means to share them with others in the area also interested in this material. And yes I am sure there exist ways for me to do this if I really tried, but I believe giving a book a memory has more implications that simply making it easily shareable.</p>
<p>Here are a few questions that this idea has raised over the years as I wondered about how it might be developed:</p>
 
 
<p>How might we digitally represent a physical book?</p>
 
 How would you link the physical book with it’s digital representation? 
 Would a QR Code work here? 
 
 
 
<p>How might we represent ownership?</p>
 
 What affordances should owners of books have? 
 What affordances should borrower’s have? 
 
 
 
<p>How would books within the virtual library be discovered, requested and returned?</p>
 
 How might you pay for postage of book between participants? 
 
<p>What if the model was to create primarily a local virtual library, but with exchanges between localities when requested?</p>
 
 Libraries have existed like this for ages. 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>How might the digital representation of a book be used to embed it with a memory?</p>
 
 What information would the book want to store in it’s memory? 
 How might we represent the list of borrowers without compromising their privacy? 
 
<p>What if the book had an interface to the Community Mind allowing readers to ask and share questions that the material provoked in them?</p>
 
 How might being in possession of a book, either as a lender or borrower provide a mechanism for access control into other applications? E.g. the Community Mind. 
 
 
 What can we learn from the way individuals interact with eBook’s today? 
 How might this approach help us appreciate this medium more deeply? 
 
 
 
<p>How might we deter bad actors abusing the virtual library?</p>
 
 What is the incentive model? 
 Who decides? 
 What is to stop malicious actors creating virtual book’s unattached to physical copies?  
 What prevents people from stealing book’s they have borrowed? 
 
 
 Who stores the information around virtual books?  
 
<p>How are the search and discovery capabilities for these books mediated? </p>
 
 Who is mediating this? 
 
 
 What can we learn from the way book’s are shared and exchanged by travellers? 
 
<p>What if the things we bought came with a configurable and extendable digital memory?</p>
 
 How might this both simplify and expand the field of interaction enabled and perceived by those in proximity to the device? 
 
 
 
<p>As usual, a whole load of questions. Always there are questions. I present them here to provoke your own thought and inquiry around these ideas.</p>
 The Common Thread 
<p>Now, these ideas are not directly or intentionally linked. They are connected through me, and through my desire to produce ideas for software applications I would be motivated to create. Most developers you meet will have a few of these kicking around if you ask them. Over time all ideas evolve, dots connect and new insight emerges. The three ideas I presented trace the evolution of me, as much as anything else, from a computer science undergraduate to hopefully a final year PhD student. </p>
<p>It is only recently, from the new perspectives my research has provided me that I can reflect on all these ideas and clearly see a common thread in my thinking. In keeping with the article will summarise in a series of questions:</p>
 
 
<p>How might we use technology to experiment with the ways in which we can attach memory to the artifacts we place meaning in?</p>
 
 How might we design this memory to be open and extendable supporting permission-less innovation at the edges? 
 
 
 
<p>How might artifacts use this memory to intelligently interact with it’s environment and the people interacting with it?</p>
 
 How might such artifacts be designed to respect the privacy of those it interacts with while ensuring they are held accountable within a defined context? 
 
 
 
<p>What if we started to centralise information on artifacts, using our physical interaction with these artifacts to provide an alternative to the search engine for the discovery of information?</p>
 
 How might centralising information on the artifact, be that a location, object or thought transform the way  design digital systems and our ability to actively maintain collective memory at all scales of society? 
 
 
 How might context-relative informational norms for managing this memory be defined, communicated, upheld and evolved? 
 How might such artifacts change the way we identify and authenticate digitally? 
 
<p>How might this change the nature of the virtual spaces we interact in?</p>
 
 How might this provide natural limits to the participants within these spaces? 
 How might this create virtual neighbours and encourage trustworthy behaviour and positive relationships? 
 
 
 
<p>What are the descriptive and normative properties for structuring memory?</p>
 
 What are the properties of collective memory that we experience in the majority of virtual environments we exist in today and how do they differ from the ways we have managed memory in the physical reality across time and context? 
 
 
 
<p>It is an exploration of the structure of memory, how we might augment this structure with intention using digital technology and the implications of this on meaning making within both individuals and groups. To date this exploration has predominantly involved a few powerful entities constructing, owning and manipulating the digital structures of memory to meet their own agenda’s <a>5</a>. </p>
<p>It is also interesting to me that while working on this idea I created artifacts, both physical and digital, they hold meaning to me but are no longer only accessible too me. By committing thoughts to paper, code or words, they become remembered at least partially in a different kind of memory. Indeed this text itself is one of these artifacts.</p>
<p>I could go on, but it’s long already and I wrote this for fun more than anything. A break from the rigidity of academic writing that can be suffocating at times. A more detailed, formal analysis of these ideas is for another time. </p>
<p>Thanks for making it this far. These thoughts are pretty fresh, I would love to know what they triggered in you. </p>
 
 
 
 
<p>This is something my thoughts wander across on occasion. I am always drawn the ideas in quantum field theory where particles exist in a field of potential, it is only upon measurement that the field collapses. Feels like there is something interesting in having a similar mental model for identity.</p>

<p>Persistent Compute Objects, a fascinating but little known project originating from Phil Windely some time ago I believe. It is currently being actively developed at Brigham Young university.

<p>One idea that stuck with me from this is location based authentication.

     <p></p><br><p>I have written and read my fair share of board and investment papers over the past 25 years.&nbsp; This post is not to add to the abundance of excellent work on how to write a better board/ investment paper or what the best structure is - it would annoy you and waste my time.&nbsp;</p><p>A classic “board paper” will likely have the following headings: Introduction, Background, Rationale, Structure/ Operations, Illustrative Financials &amp; Scenarios, Competition, Risks and Legal. Case by case there are always minor adjustments. Finally, there will be some form of Recommendation inviting the board to note key facts and approve the request.&nbsp; I believe it is time for the Chair or CEO, with the support of their senior data lead (#CDO) to ask that each board paper has a new section heading called &nbsp; “Data Attestation.”&nbsp; Some will favour this as an addition to the main flow, some as a new part of legal, others as an appendix; how and where matters little compared to its intent.</p><p>The intention of this new heading and section is that the board receives a *signed* declaration from the proposer(s) and independent data expert, that the proposer has:</p>  <p>proven attestation of the data used in the board paper,&nbsp;</p>  <p>proven rights to use the data</p>  <p>what difference/ delta third-party data makes the recommendation/ outcome</p>  <p>ensured, to best efforts, that there is no bias or selection in the data or analysis</p>  <p>clearly specifies any decision making that is or becomes automated&nbsp;</p>  <p>if relevant created the hypothesis before the analysis&nbsp;</p>  <p>run scenarios using different data and tools</p>  <p>not miss-led the board using data</p>  <p>highlighted the conflicts of interest between their BSC/KPI and the approval sort</p>  <br><p>In regards to the independent auditor, this should not be the companies financial auditor or data lake provider, this should be an independent forensic data expert. Audit suggests sampling; this is not about sampling. It is not about creating more hurdles or handing power to an external body, this is about third party verification and validation. A company you build a list of experts and cycle through them on a regular basis. The auditor does not need to see the board paper, the outcome from the analysis or the recommendations - they are there to check the attestation and efficacy from end to end.&nbsp; Critical will be proof of their expertise and a large insurance certificate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p>Whilst this is not the final wording you will use, it is the intent that is important, this does not remove data risks from the risk section.</p><p>Data Attestation</p><p>We certify by our signatures that we, the proposer and auditor, can prove to OurCompany PLC Board that we have provable <a href="https://tonyfish.medium.com/does-data-have-a-purpose-57249c7c8e1e">attestation and rights</a> to all the data used in the presentation of this paper. &nbsp; We have presented in this paper sensitivity of the selected data, model and tools and have provided evidence that different data and analysis tool selection equally favours the recommendation.&nbsp; We have tested and can verify that our data, analysis, insights and knowledge is traceable and justifiable.&nbsp; We declare that there are no Conflicts of Interest and no automation of decision making will result from this approval.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Why do this?</p><p>Whilst Directors are collectively accountable and responsible for the decisions they take, right now there is a gap in skills in data and many board members don’t know how to test the data that forms the basis on which they are being asked to approve. This is all new and a level of detail that requires deep expertise.&nbsp; This provides an additional line until such time that we can gain sufficient skills at the Board and test data properly.&nbsp; Yes, there is a high duty of care that is already intrinsic in anyone who presents a board paper, however, the data expertise and skills in the majority of senior levels are also well below what we need.&nbsp; If nothing else it will get those presenting to think carefully about data, bias and the ethics of their proposal.&nbsp;</p><br><br><br><br>

<a href="https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/uploads/web_dev_pillar_page.jpg">https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/uploads/web_dev_pillar_page.jpg</a> Why developer-first IAM&nbsp;? And why Okta’s Auth0 acquisition matters? <p>In my previous blog, <a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com/the-next-tcp-ip-moment-in-identity-464fdb559f3b">The Next TCP/IP Moment in Identity</a>, I discussed why the enterprises will demand for developer-first IAM. As every company is becoming a software company, and starting to build their competitive advantage on the software they build, the developer-first IAM will free the developers from inherent complexities in doing Identity integrations.</p><p>The <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/okta-auth0-announcement/">announcement</a> came yesterday on Okta’s intention to acquire Auth0 for $6.5B, which is probably 40 times the Auth0’s current revenue, is a true validation of the push towards developer-first IAM. However, this is not Okta’s first effort towards developer-first IAM. In 2017, Okta acquired Stormpath, a company that built tools to help developers to integrate login with their apps. Stormpath soon got absorbed into the Okta platform, but yet, Okta’s selling strategy didn’t change. It was always top-down.</p><p>In contrast to Okta, Auth0 follows a bottom-up sales strategy. One of the analysts I spoke to couple of years back told that the Auth0 name comes in an inquiry call only when a developer joins in. The acquisition of Auth0 will give Okta, the access to a broader market. So, it is important for Okta to let Auth0 run as an independent business, as also mentioned in the acquisition announcement.</p><p>Auth0 is not just about the product; but also the developer tooling, content and the developer community around it. Okta will surely benefit from this ecosystem around Auth0. Also, for years, Azure is the primary competitor of Okta, and Auth0 acquisition will make Okta stronger against Azure in the long&nbsp;run.</p><p>Late 2020, in one of the the earnings calls, the Okta announced that it sees the total market for its workplace identity management software as $30 billion, but it sees another, additional market for customer identity software at $25 billion. In the customer Identity space, when we talk to enterprises, they bring in their unique requirements. In many cases they look for a product that can be used to build an agile, event-driven customer Identity (CIAM) platform that can flex to meet frequently changing business requirements. The developer-first IAM is more critical in building a CIAM solution than in workforce IAM. In the latest Forrester <a href="https://wso2.com/resources/analyst-reports/the-forrester-wave-customer-identity-and-access-management-q4-2020/">report</a> on CIAM, Auth0 is way ahead of Okta, in terms of the current product offering. Okta will probably use Auth0 to increase their presence in the CIAM domain. Like Microsoft has Azure AD to focus on workforce IAM and Azure B2C to focus on CIAM, Auth0 could be Okta’s offering for&nbsp;CIAM.</p>Forrester CIAM Wave&nbsp;2020<p>When Auth0 was founded in 2013, it picked a less-saturated (even right to say fresh), future-driven market segment in IAM — developer-first. Developer-first is all about the experience. Auth0 did extremely well there. They were worried about building the right level of developer experience, rather than the feature set. Even today, Auth0 stands against others not because of their feature set, but the experience they build for developers.</p><p>The developer-first experience is not only about the product. How you build product features in a developer-first manner, probably contribute 50% of the total effort. The rest is about developer tooling, SDKs, and the content. Then again, the content is not just about the product. The larger portion of the content needs to be on how to integrate the product with a larger ecosystem — and also to teach developers the basic constructs, concepts and best practices in IAM. That helps to win the developer trust!</p>How the Auth0 website looked like in July,&nbsp;2014<p>Auth0’s vision towards developer-first IAM evolved over the past. The way the Auth0 website itself evolved in terms of the messaging and the presentation, reflects how much they want to be on the enterprisy side more today than in the past. As they claim Auth0 has 9000+ enterprise customers, which probably generate $150M annual revenue, the average sales value (ASV) would be around $16500. That probably means, the majority of Auth0 customers are in free/developer/developer pro tiers. So, it’s understandable why they want to bring in enterprise look and messaging, probably moving forward to focus more on top-down driven sales strategy. The big Contact Sales button over the Signup button on the Auth0 website today, sums up this direction to some extent.The Okta’s acquisition of Auth0 could probably strengthen this&nbsp;move.</p>How the Auth0 website looks like today (March,&nbsp;2021)<p>Like Microsoft’s acquisition of GitHub for $7.5B in 2018, Okta’s acquisition of Auth0 for $6.5B is a win for developers! Congratulations to both Auth0 and Okta and very much looking forward to see the journey of Auth0 together with&nbsp;Okta.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com/why-developer-first-iam-and-why-oktas-auth0-acquisition-matters-9fff3dde81">Why developer-first IAM and why Okta’s Auth0 acquisition matters?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com">FACILELOGIN</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>February 22,&nbsp;2021</p><p>The Honorable Xavier&nbsp;Becerra</p><p>California State&nbsp;Capitol</p><p>SENT VIA&nbsp;EMAIL</p><p>Dear Attorney General&nbsp;Becerra,</p><p>On behalf of the Blockchain Advocacy Coalition, an organization of blockchain and virtual currency businesses in California, I write to bring to your attention a pending federal regulation that would preempt and refute many of the important privacy protections your office has led the nation on. On December 18, 2020 the US Treasury led by Steve Mnuchin, released a concerning proposed rule that would put into place first of its kind reporting requirements for virtual currencies and digital assets. The agency initially proposed a 15 day comment period over the holidays due to unsubstantiated ‘national security concerns’. After widespread pushback from private citizens, virtual currency companies and members of Congress, the Treasury Department provided another 15 days for reporting requirements and an additional 45 for recordkeeping and counterparting reporting. Fortunately the Biden administration, faced with an avalanche of such poorly thought out rules, gave a 60 day pause and extension on the rulemaking and now the industry is facing a March 1st deadline to comment on a rule that would significantly stifle innovation, limit access to these new products and massively extend the reach of government surveillance of financial transactions far beyond the Bank Secrecy Act&nbsp;(BSA).</p><p>If it were to become policy, this rule would preempt California’s consumer privacy laws, significantly weakening the data privacy protections around financial information voters deemed important when approving the Californian Privacy Rights Act in November of 2020. While many parties have opined on the slapdash process and lack of clarity in the proposed rule, we do not believe that the blatant and far reaching consumer privacy implications have been brought to attention&nbsp;. Your office has led the charge implementing and enforcing the nation’s first and strongest consumer privacy framework, particularly for sensitive financial information. Because of this, we wanted to raise the following concerns with the proposed FinCEN rulemaking and ask for your action. The proposed rule complements existing BSA requirements applicable to banks and MSBs (money service business) by proposing to add reporting requirements for virtual currency transactions exceeding $10,000 in value. Pursuant to the proposed rule, banks and MSBs will have 15 days from the date on which a reportable transaction occurs to file a report with FinCEN. Further, this proposed rule would require banks and MSBs to keep&nbsp;records</p><p>of a customer’s virtual currency transactions and counterparties, including verifying the identity of their customers, if a counterparty uses an unhosted or otherwise covered wallet and the transaction is greater than&nbsp;$3,000.</p><p>Our concerns with the consumer privacy implications of this proposed rule are&nbsp;twofold:</p><p>First, the proposed rule’s requirement that MSB’s collect identifying information associated with wallet addresses will create reporting that extends well beyond the intent of the rule or the transaction. According to the EFF “For some cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, transaction data — including users’ Bitcoin addresses — is permanently recorded on a public blockchain. That means that if you know the name of the user associated with a particular Bitcoin address, you can glean information about all of their Bitcoin transactions that use that address.” California consumers do not have the expectation that a future reporting requirement will link to their entire financial transaction history from that&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>Second, this rule creates requirements for disclosure of counterparty information beyond what the BSA requires banks and other financial institutions to collect. It wouldn’t only require these businesses to collect information about their own customers, but also the information of anyone who transacts with those customers using their own cryptocurrency wallets. Specifically:</p>  The name and physical address of each counterparty to the transaction of the financial institution’s customer;  Other counterparty information the Secretary may prescribe as mandatory on the reporting form for transactions subject to reporting pursuant to § 1010.316(b);  Any other information that uniquely identifies the transaction, the accounts, and, to the extent reasonably available, the parties involved;  <p>Unlike KYC (know your customer) requirements which arise from a direct customer relationship, KYCC (know your customer’s counterparty) requirements unreasonably obligate non-customers to provide personally identifying information to a VASP/MSB (virtual asset service provide/money services business) they do not know or do business with, and whose security and privacy practices they have not evaluated, simply because they happen to transact with one of its customers.</p><p>In its haste, the Treasury did not adequately consider the impact of these rules on consumer privacy for those that choose to use virtual currency and would create large scale government surveillance of small personal transactions. We call upon your leadership and expertise in this space to once again lead the charge for consumer protections and submit a comment letter opposing these portions of the proposed rule. Thank you for your consideration and please do not hesitate to reach out with any questions.</p><p>Kind Regards,</p><p>Ally Medina</p><p>Director, Blockchain Advocacy Coalition</p>

<p>Loved reading the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ask-Your-Developer-Software-Developers/dp/0063018292">Ask Your Developer: How to Harness the Power of Software Developers and Win in the 21st Century</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffiel">Jeff&nbsp;Lawson</a>.</p><p>Jeff says in the book that every company is on a journey to becoming a software company and everyone is starting to see the world through the lens of software. He defines the term, software person. A software person is not necessarily a developer, it’s anybody who, when faced with a problem, asks the question, how can software solve this&nbsp;problem?</p> Build vs. Buy (or vs.&nbsp;Die) <p>In the book, Jeff takes the popular debate, build vs. buy, to another dimension; build vs die. As every company is becoming a software company, the competitive advantage they build is in the software they build. When software becomes the interface where the services you offer, meet the customers; unless you build it in the way you want; you&nbsp;die!</p><p>Building what you want gives you the freedom to experiment (or innovate). More you experiment or the ability to experiment more, gives you the edge to understand your customers more. Hence, you grow your business.</p><p>Build, does not necessarily mean building everything from scratch. You don’t build anything that already exists, given that it provides what you need. You only build things that are core to your business, which help building your competitive advantage over all the others. The rest, or the building blocks that help you build what you wish are part of the digital supply&nbsp;chain.</p> The Digital Supply&nbsp;Chain <p>Uber, for example, uses 4000+ microservices internally. However, not all of them are developed by Uber itself. Uber uses Google Maps API to pull out location data, the Twilio API to facilitate communication between passengers and drivers and many other APIs. All these APIs are coming from the digital supply chain Uber picks to build its product. Then again, these building blocks in Uber’s digital supply chain are also available to Lyft, and other Uber competitors around the world. What brings Uber the competitive advantage is in what they&nbsp;build!</p><p>The software you build, can be your product, at the same time it can be a building block for another product. Google Maps is Google’s product, however the Google Maps API is a building block for Uber. Alexa is a product of Amazon, however Alexa API is a a building block for&nbsp;Nissan.</p><p>Picking the right digital supply chain is equally important as what you pick to build. Think, what if Uber had to build something equivalent to Google Maps from the scratch? From 2016 to 2018, Uber paid 58M USD to Google for using Google Maps. But, then again it’s a peanut, when you compare that with their revenue in 2019, which was 14.15 billion&nbsp;USD.</p><p>Having the right digital supply chain helps you to optimize your development team to build only what you need and no more. Instagram, for example, was only a 13 people team, when Facebook acquired it for $1B in 2012; and WhatsApp team was only 50, when Facebook acquired it for $19B in&nbsp;2014.</p> Build Your Own Identity&nbsp;Stack? <p>Every service you develop, every API you design, every device you use, every person you interact with, will have a managed identity, and in today’s hyperconnected world, the Identity integrations with these business applications and systems, is going to be critical.</p><p>Going back to the build vs. die debate; do you still have to build the Identity stack to gain the competitive advantage in your business? If you are in the Identity business, of course yes, for all the others no. Identity stack you need to build your product is a building block in the digital supply&nbsp;chain.</p><p>You never worried about building a TCP/IP stack yourself, so, don’t worry about building an Identity stack yourself. However, over the time we have spoken to over a thousand companies (hundreds of them are WSO2 customers), and in most of the cases they bring in unique identity requirements. The uniqueness comes in those requirements are specific to the industry they are in and also specific to the complexity of the business problem they want to&nbsp;solve.</p><p>Identity is core to any business, and how you manage identity will also help you in building competitive advantage. At WSO2, we have worked with 90% of the Identity Server customers to solve complex identity problems. Identity Server is open source, and if the business problem is straightforward, they don’t even talk to us, they simply use the product as it is. However, when we work with complex Identity requirements, we have extended the product to solve specific business problems.</p><p>Building these extensions, specific to unique business requirements helped companies to differentiate themselves from others. Then again, they didn’t want to build everything from scratch — rather they started with what’s common (and available to everyone) and started innovating on that. That drastically reduced the time-to-market, and also gave the freedom to innovate.</p><p>I don’t intend to contradict with what I mentioned before, that the Identity stack is part of the digital supply chain you pick, however, the Identity stack you pick for the digital supply chain should have the flexibility to extend with minimal effort to build business requirements specific to your business.</p> The TCP/IP Moment in&nbsp;Identity <p>In the 70’s, having support for TCP/IP in a product was considered to be a competitive advantage. Today, it’s given, and nobody worries about TCP/IP support; it’s everywhere.</p><p>Ian Glazer from Salesforce, mentioned in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZPd584l6o&amp;ab_channel=KuppingerCole">keynote</a> at the European Identity Conference 2016 that, it’s the TCP/IP moment in Identity now. He in fact talked about the open standards (SAML, OpenID Connect, OAuth, SCIM, XACML and so on) in the Identity domain, and how they are going to be part of every product, so no Identity vendor is going to gain competitive advantage just by supporting the open standards. RFPs looking for Identity products will not even worry about asking support for these open standards.</p> The Next TCP/IP Moment in&nbsp;Identity <p>Developers do not worry about building a TCP/IP stack, or even worrying about TCP/IP while building software. We believe, the Identity integrations with business applications and systems need to be developer-first (or developer-focused) with the right level of abstractions and tools.

SSI — Legal compliance and the involvement of governments<p>This article describes how governments of sovereign states might be involved in building identity ecosystems based on self-sovereign principles and how regulatory conformity of such ecosystems can be achieved.</p><p>When it comes to identity management the involvement of the government can be a tricky topic. It needs to be involved to enable access to public services, adapt legislature and guarantee equal access for its citizens. However, it should not be able to control or monitor all aspects and activities of its citizens. Self-sovereign identity (SSI) might for some imply, that a citizen is suddenly able to issue his own ID-card, which isn’t the case. Governments are still the primary source of foundational identities.</p> The government as issuer of foundational identities <p>While individuals gain more autonomy with SSI the issuance of national IDs is still the responsibility of the public administration. The Pan Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF) differentiates between foundational and contextual identities.</p><blockquote>“A foundational identity is an identity that has been established or changed as a result of a foundational event (e.g., birth, person legal name change, immigration, legal residency, naturalized citizenship, death, organization legal name registration, organization legal name change, or bankruptcy).” <a href="https://canada-ca.github.io/PCTF-CCP/">PCTF</a>&nbsp;[1]</blockquote><p>Hence, the government continues to be the issuer of foundational identities and still holds the authority to revoke these credentials when necessary. However, SSI also enables the usage of other identity providers, which are context dependent — leading to a contextual identity as further explained within the&nbsp;PCTF.</p><blockquote>“A Contextual Identity is an identity that is used for a specific purpose within a specific identity context (e.g., banking, business permits, health services, drivers licensing, or social media). Depending on the identity context, a contextual identity may be tied to a foundational identity (e.g., a drivers licence) or may not be tied to a foundational identity (e.g., a social media profile).“ [1]</blockquote><p>This means a customer of a bank can use his verified bank ID to identify himself at a credit bureau. Since the bank ID is based on a foundational identity, the contextual identity provided by the bank can be sufficient in this particular use-case given the regulatory environment allows such a usage. However, a contextual identity can, but doesn’t have to be based on a foundational identity.</p><p>The European Commission supports the continued usage of contextual identities online and only demands the usage of foundational identities when required by law as stated in the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12528">eIDAS public consultation</a> [2] regarding the option to extend the regulation for the public&nbsp;sector:</p><blockquote>“A European identity solution enabling trusted identification of citizens and companies in their digital interactions to access public or private online services (e.g. e- commerce), should be entirely voluntary for users to adhere to and fully protect data and privacy. Anonymity of the internet should be ensured at all times by allowing solutions for anonymous authentication anonymously where user identification is not required for the provision of the service.“ [2]</blockquote> Regulatory compliancy <p>When dealing with personally identifiable information (PII) all involved stakeholders need to adhere to a certain set of laws, which dictate the usage of the such data. These laws highly depend on the citizenship of the data subject (the individual the PII is about) among other important factors. Although the following paragraphs are specifically devoted to the laws of the European Union, the conclusion might also be applied to similar laws such as the <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</a> or the <a href="https://law.asia/regional-data-privacy-laws/">Indian Personal Data Protection Bill&nbsp;(DPA)</a>.</p><p>Within the European Union, there are two laws, which have a significant influence on identity frameworks. The General Data Protection Regulation, better known as GDPR, determines how personal data from EU citizens can be collected and used. The other important law is the Electronic IDentification, Authentication and trust Services (eIDAS) provision specified in <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/system/files/ged/eidas_regulation.pdf">N°910/2014</a> [3]. It constitutes the main electronic identification trust framework in the EU and is an elemental building block of the digital single&nbsp;market.</p> GDPR — General Data Protection Regulation Overview of important roles regarding PII data management according to international standards.<p>The <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITALEBSI/Legal+Assessm%20ent+Reports">EBSI GDPR assessment</a> [4] notes&nbsp;that</p><blockquote>“According to this Regulation, there are two types of actors whose key role in data processing and whose relationship to the data within the data processing environment leads the European legislator to attribute them a set of obligations and responsibilities. Thus, these liable actors are subject to data protection rules.“&nbsp;[4]</blockquote><p>These are data controllers, which are defined in article <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679">4(7) GDPR</a> [5]&nbsp;as</p><blockquote>“the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law”&nbsp;[5]</blockquote><p>which</p><blockquote>“have to take all necessary measures so that data subjects are sufficiently informed and have the ability to exercise their data protection rights.“&nbsp;[4]</blockquote><p>The other actor is the data processor who acts as delegate of the data controller and is a separate legal entity according to the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2010/wp169_en.pdf">opinion 1/2010 of the Data protection working party.</a> [6] With multiple nodes running a decentralized network every node acts as a data processor or data controller depending on if the node operator is processing the data as a delegate or not. The EBSI GDPR report further&nbsp;notes:</p><blockquote>“in case of joint controllership, data controllers can contractually assign partial responsibility based on distinct stages of data processing.“ While an agreement between these data processors can regulate the responsibilities, “data subjects will have ot (sic!) be able to exercise their rights against every joint controller“ and “nodes that add and process the on-chain ledger data in order to maintain the consensus will be individually qualified as joint data controllers and this, regardless of a contractual relationship stating the contrary.“ [4]</blockquote><p>For public blockchains with permissionless write access such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, this means, that every miner, which is participating in the proof of work consensus is regarded as data processor given there is an unintentional personal data leakage or correlation with an URL (Uniform resource locator) of a service endpoint within DID Documents as pointed out as critical to keep PII private by the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-core/">DID specification of the W3C in section 10.1</a>.[7] This threat in addition of the numerous other correlation risks mentioned in section 10.2 and 10.3 of said specification make the current implementation of SSI based on permissionless blockchains, which inhibit the capability for natural persons to write a anywise DID on the ledger, a daunting privacy challenge.</p><p>Another important aspect is the question if credentials (or any other form of PII) is stored as hash on the verifiable data registry. A hash is a data digest and is considered a one-way function, which in theory leads to an anonymization of the original information. The debate around the question if a hash constitutes PII is likely to continue, since national data protection agencies are struggling to clearly define if the hashing can be considered an anonymization or pseudonymization.</p><blockquote>“According to the Spanish DPA (Data protection agency), hashing can at times be considered as anonymization or pseudonymization depending on a variety of factors varying from the entities involved to the type of the data at hand.“&nbsp;[4]</blockquote><p>Even if the hash constitutes a one-way obfuscation technique, which anonymizes PII, it I) requires a transaction on a public ledger and II) it puts data controllers in a higher risk position with the obligation to avoid correlation of individuals. Risk minimizing obligations for data controllers are easier to implement when there is no hash of a verified credential or verified presentation stored on a public&nbsp;ledger.</p><p>When it comes to the wallet itself the EBSI GDPR report notes&nbsp;that</p><blockquote>“there is growing consensus about the possibility of data subjects to being simultaneously considered as data controllers for the data that refer to themselves“. The report provides the recommendation that “the privacy preserving technical and organisational measures of the wallet and the personal data transmissions should ensure that the necessary safeguards are in place in order to not limit the empowerment of the data subject through the DLT chosen model.“&nbsp;[4]</blockquote><p>The report concludes, that data within the wallet application is considered personal data and therefor is subject to the data protection regulation.</p><p>While there is a general assumption that e.g. <a href="https://sovrin.org/wp-content/uploads/GDPR-Paper_V1.pdf">Hyperledger Indy implementations are GDPR compliant</a> [8], ultimately courts have to decide if that claim holds up based on a case by case evaluation on the particular implementation. Nevertheless, avoiding the exposure of PII on the verifiable data registry, by I) not allowing natural persons to write public DIDs and II) not storing PII in hashed form on the verifiable data registry facilitate the GDPR compliance obligations.</p> eIDAS: <p>The <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/system/files/ged/eidas_regulation.pdf">eIDAS regulation</a> [3] is concerned with two distinct topics. One part is concerned with trust services for private businesses such as electronic signatures, seal, time stamps etc. The other part is regulating the mutual recognition among member states of national implementations of electronic identification (eID) for the public sector. Is a technology neutral approach, which has a strong influence on the international regulatory space. The main goal of mutual recognition of eID is to enable EU citizens access to cross-border public services with their own national eID means. The implementation of eID schemes vary from member state to member state and not all member states have notified an eID scheme as illustrated by the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/EIDCOMMUNITY/Overview+of+pre-notified+and+notified+eID+schemes+under+eIDAS">overview of pre-notified and notified eID schemes</a> [9] under&nbsp;eIDAS.</p><p>There are three levels of assurance specified for eIDs under eIDAS referring to the degree of confidence in the claimed identity of a person, which include detailed criteria allowing member states to map their eID means against a benchmark (low, substantial and high). Current SSI implementations have the objective to be recognized with a level of assurance specified as substantial.</p><p>It’s currently possible to be eIDAS compliant with SSI by leveraging one out of five scenarios described in the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITALEBSI/Legal+Assessment+Reports">SSI eIDAS legal report by Dr. Ignacio Alamillo Domingo</a> [10]. Especially interesting is the <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/ssi-eidas-bridge">SSI eIDAS bridge</a>, which adds legal value to verified credentials with the use of electronic certificates and electronic seals. However, it’s also possible to derive national eIDs notified in eIDAS, which are eIDAS linked by deriving a national eID by issuing a verifiable credential with a qualified certificate according to the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITALEBSI/Technical+Spe%20V%20cification+%2815%29+-+eIDAS+bridge+for+VC-eSealing">technical specification</a>.[12]</p><p>Nevertheless, there are also hindrances in the process of creating a qualified certificate with the derived national identity, because of the way the regulation is defining a qualified signature. Another issue is that national eID schemes require the keys to be in a secure element. However, current SSI wallets only offer software keys and do not leverage the security benefits of a hardware element. Furthermore, the eIDAS regulation doesn’t regulate the case of a private entity issuing an eID attribute to a natural person for the usage of it in other private interactions.</p><p>Furthermore, the authentication process to achieve the recognition of notified eIDAS schemes by other member states requires a national node, which provides the authentication service. While aimed to be technology neutral, the obligation to provide this authentication service as delegated authentication component has several drawbacks and also hinders the potential adoption of SSI. The EU has already identified the need to re-evaluate the policies set by&nbsp;eIDAS.</p><blockquote>“Fundamental changes in the overall societal context suggest a revision of the eIDAS Regulation. These include a dramatic increase in the use of novel technologies, such as distributed-ledger based solutions, the Internet of Thing, Artificial Intelligence and biometrics, changes in the market structure where few players with significant market power increasingly act as digital identity ‘gatekeepers’, changes in user behavior with increasing demand for instant, convenient and secure identification and the evolution of EU Data Protection legislation” [2]</blockquote><p>The consultation continues with its&nbsp;target:</p><blockquote>“The objective of this initiative is, first of all, to provide a future proof regulatory framework to support an EU-wide, simple, trusted and secure system to manage identities in the digital space, covering identification, authentication and the provision of attributes, credentials and attestations. Secondly, the initiative aims at creating a universal pan-European single digital ID. These objectives could be achieved through an overhaul of the eIDAS system, an extension of eIDAS to the private sector, the introduction of a European Digital Identity (EUid) building on the eIDAS system or combination of both.”&nbsp;[2]</blockquote><p>In an private interview for an academic study Dr. Ignacio Alamillo Domingo suggested embodying new technologies such as SSI into the revised regulation e.g. by not mandating the provision of an authentication facility and creating new trust services such as electronic identification. In another private interview Luca Boldrin suggested keeping national identity systems as they are but use a derivation of national identity for cross-border context for public and private businesses in parallel to current node implementation to enable a European identity.</p><p>Dr. Ignacio Alamillo Domingo argues that having derived national eIDs and eID trust services has the benefit of increased privacy by using a peer to peer authentication instead of a delegated authentication model (the national eIDAS node). This also leads to less liability issues by shifting the authentication part to private providers as well as less costs associated with running authentication infrastructure for governments, because these are provided by Distributed Public Key Infrastructure (DPKI) instead of national eIDAS nodes. These DPKI systems also have the benefits of being more resilient to attacks compared to a single node, which represents a single point of failure. However, regulating eID as trust service also means opening up identification for the private market, which might not be in the interest of national governments.</p><p>Disclaimer: This article does not represent the official view of any entity, which is mentioned in this article or which is affiliated with the author.

<p>When I walk around our neighborhood I see very few copies of our local newspaper on sidewalks, porches, and front lawns. We subscribe because it’s a lifelong habit, and because we like to support local journalism, and in my case because it’s a welcome reprieve from a long day of screentime.</p>
<p>This archaic habit has also, weirdly, become a kind of superpower. From time to time I meet people who are surprised when I know facts about them. These facts are public information, so why should it be surprising that I know them? Because they appear in the print edition of the newspaper. Consider the man in this photo.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We were out for a Sunday morning walk, carrying the newspaper, when we saw him in a cafe. We had just read an article about <a href="https://www.facebook.com/petalumawhiskerino/photos">Whiskerino</a>, the annual contest of fancy beards and mustaches in Petaluma. And here was the guy whose photo was featured in the article!</p>
<p>That was a nice coincidence, but the kicker is that he had no idea his picture was in the paper. Not being of newspaper-reading age, and not having friends of newspaper-reading age, he had to depend on elders to alert him. I guess we got to him before his parents did.</p>
<p>When a similar thing happened this weekend, it occurred to me that this could be a good marketing strategy for newspapers. Do you want to wield an information superpower? Do you want to amaze people by knowing facts that they can’t imagine you could possibly know? Subscribe to the print edition of your local newspaper!</p>

 <a href="https://ludopoitou.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/directoryservices.png"></a> 



<p>In August 2020, we’ve rolled out a <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/forgerock-identity-platform-updates-are-here">new release of the ForgeRock Identity Platform</a> which included updated versions of all of the products, including <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/directory-services">Directory Services</a> 7.0. I didn’t write a post about the new release, mostly due to our focus to deliver the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/forgerock-identity-cloud-gets-even-better">ForgeRock Identity Cloud</a> and family vacation.</p>



<p>But ForgeRock Directory Services 7.0 is a major release in many ways. It is the first to be released with <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ds/7/release-notes/whats-new.html#whats-new-700">a sample docker file and full support to run in Kubernetes</a> environments in the Cloud. To achieve that, we’ve made a number of significant changes especially in how security is managed, and how replication is configured and enabled. The rest of the server remains quite the same, delivering consistent performance and reliability. You should read the <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ds/7/release-notes/whats-new.html">release notes</a> for all the details.</p>



<p>Since, DS 7 was successfully deployed in production, in VMs or in Docker/Kubernetes, and our customers have praised the simplicity and efficiency of the new version. However, some customers have experienced some difficulties with upgrading their current deployment to the 7.0 release, mostly due to the changes I’ve mentioned above. So we have been improving our <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ds/7/upgrade-guide/">Upgrade Guide</a>, with greater details, and my colleague <a href="https://marginnotes2.wordpress.com/">Mark Craig</a>, has posted a series of 3 articles on Upgrading to Directory Services 7: </p>

<p>If you’re planning to upgrade an OpenDJ or a ForgeRock Directory Services to the latest release, I would high recommend to read the <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ds/7/upgrade-guide/">Directory Services Upgrade Guide</a>, and then <a href="https://marginnotes2.wordpress.com/2021/02/10/upgrade-to-ds-7-1-whats-changed/">Mark’s posts</a>.</p>

<p>In a 1999 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=642&amp;v=FiK7s_0tGsg">interview</a> David Bowie said that “the potential for what the Internet is going to do to society, both good and bad, is unimaginable.” I had no problem imagining the good, it was the bad where my imagination failed. The web of the late 90s was a cornucopia of wonder, delight, and inspiration. So was the blogosophere of the early 2000s. I know a lot of us are nostalgic for those eras, and depressed about how things have turned out. The bad is really quite bad, and sometimes I feel like there’s no way forward.</p>
<p>And then something wonderful happens. This time the spark was David Grinspoon aka @DrFunkySpoon. I’ve written before about a Long Now talk in which he posits that we might not just be living through the beginning of a geological epoch called the Anthropocene but rather — and far more profoundly — the dawn of an eon that he calls <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2017/09/25/welcome-to-the-sapiezoic/">the Sapiezoic</a>. Today he posted <a href="https://twitter.com/DrFunkySpoon/status/1358064758763753478">a stunning new visualization of plate tectonics</a>.</p>
<p>As always when I think about plate tectonics, I’m reminded of the high school science teacher who introduced me to the topic. His name is John Ousey, and this happened almost 50 years ago. What always stuck with me is the way he presented it. Back then, plate tectonics was a new idea. As Mr. Ousey (he later became Dr. Ousey) described the continents sliding apart, I can still see the bemused look on his face. He was clearly wrestling with the concept, unsure whether to believe things really happen that way. That healthy skepticism, coupled with trust in the scientific process, made an indelible impression on me.</p>
<p>One of the wonders of the Internet is the ability to find people. It took some sleuthing, but I did find him and this ensued.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wrote to John Ousey and he replied!</p>
<p>"I learned about Plate Tectonics (then called Continental Drift) by taking weekend courses taught by the great teacher/researcher Ehrling Dorf of Princeton. It was brand new and I'm not sure that he was totally convinced about it either."</p>
<p>— Jon Udell (@judell) <a href="https://twitter.com/judell/status/1358106780153249792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 6, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>That’s the kind of magic that can still happen, that does happen all the time.</p>
<p>I learned for the first time that John Ousey’s introduction to plate tectonics came by way of “weekend courses taught by the great teacher/researcher Ehrling Dorf of Princeton” who was himself perhaps “not totally convinced.” Despite uncertainty, which he acknowledged, John Ousey was happy to share an important new idea with his Earth science class.</p>
<p>What a privilege to be able to thank him, after all these years, for being a great teacher who helped me form a scientific sensibility that has never mattered more than now. And to share a moment of appreciation for an extraordinary new visualization of the process once known as continental drift. Yes, there’s a dark side to our connected world, darker than I was once willing to imagine. But there is also so much light. It’s always helpful to consider deep geological time. That video shows a billion years of planetary churn. We’ve only been connected like this for 25 years. Maybe we’ll figure it out. For today, at least, I choose to believe that we will.</p>

As <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=267">I wrote a decade, a year, and a day ago</a>, “It’s where Internet identity work gets done.”  That remains as true now is it was then!</p>
<p>As a personal testimonial, I wrote this to the IIW organizers after the 2020 IIWs:</p>
<blockquote><p>
“Thanks again for running the most engaging and successful virtual meetings of the year (by far!).  While I’ve come to dread most of the large virtual meetings, IIW online remains true to the spirit of the last 15 years of useful workshops.  Yes, I miss talking to Rich and the attendees in the coffee line and having impromptu discussions throughout, and we’ll get back to that in time, but the sessions remain useful and engaging.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m also proud that Microsoft is continuing its 15-year tradition of sponsoring the workshop.  Rather than buying dinner for the attendees (the conversations at the dinners were always fun!), we’re sponsoring scholarships for those that might otherwise not be able to attend, fostering an even more interesting and diverse set of viewpoints at the workshop.</p>
<p>I hope to see you there!</p>

<p>"Given the distributed nature of today’s technology environment, zero trust has become the standard for security. Every interaction must be authenticated and validated for every user accessing every system or application every time. To that end, interoperability is more important than ever.To that end, interoperability is more important than ever. FIDO2 Web Authentication (WebAuthn) is quickly emerging as an important interoperability standard that enables users to select and manage an authenticator of their own (security keys, or built-in platform authenticators, such as a mobile device) that works with their web browser of choice (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Apple Safari, etc.) for secure access to any websites or applications that support the WebAuthn standard."<br><br>"Oracle is happy to announce the general availability of FIDO2 WebAuthn for our cloud identity service. This means that websites and applications that are protected by Oracle can enable their audience of users to authenticate with FIDO2 authenticators for multi-factor authentication (MFA) as well as passwordless authentication. This simplifies the user experience and may reduce the number of authenticators that users need to access the variety of web applications they interact with on a regular basis. Ultimately, this gives users more choice, more control, and a frictionless user experience.</p><p>Read more on the <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/cloudsecurity/">Oracle Cloud Security Blog</a> &gt; <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/cloudsecurity/oracle-strengthens-interoperability-with-fido2-webauthn-support-for-cloud-identity">Oracle Strengthens Interoperability and User Experience with General Availability of FIDO2 WebAuthn Support for Cloud Identity</a>.</p>
