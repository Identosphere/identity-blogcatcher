<p>Kate will turn 64 years old later this month … it is never too late.</p>
<p>Beyond that, clearly, something else is going on. Detailed below are just three of many more links that I have read recently. Articles by writers I read regularly that each in their own way have latched on to the phenomena.</p>
 
 
<p>William Gallagher - always a good read gave us; <a href="http://williamgallagher.com/selfdistract/2022/06/24/seeking-out-strange-new-worlds-and-liking-them/">Seeking out strange new worlds, and liking them.</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>Rick Beato - with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwZysZPIrYI&amp;t=399s">10 a minute breakdown of the original song</a>.</p>

It’s fun too, but DALL-E’s fidelity is impressive enough to be almost <a href="https://lab.cccb.org/en/arthur-c-clarke-any-sufficiently-advanced-technology-is-indistinguishable-from-magic/">indistinguishable from magic</a>.</p><p>I can’t claim to fully understand its algorithm, but DALL-E is ultimately based on a huge corpus of information: OpenAI created a <a href="https://openai.com/blog/instruction-following/">variation of GPT-3</a> that follows human-language instructions well enough to sift through collected data and create new works based on what it’s learned. OpenAI claims to have guarded against hateful or infringing use cases, but it can never be perfect at this, and will only ever be as sensitive to these issues as the team that builds it.</p><p></p><p>These images are attention-grabbing, but the technology has lots of different applications. Some are benign: the team found that <a href="https://openai.com/blog/critiques/">AI-generated critiques</a> helped human writers find flaws in their work, for example. GitHub uses OpenAI’s libraries <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot">to help engineers write code, using a feature called Copilot</a>. There’s a Figma plugin <a href="https://gpt3demo.com/apps/gpt-3-figma-plugin">that will mock up a website based on a text description</a>. But it’s obvious that there are military and intelligence applications for this technology, too.</p><p>If I was a science fiction writer - and at night, I am! - I would ask myself what I could create if the corpus was everything. If an AI algorithm was fed with every decision made by every person in the world - our movements via our cellphones, our intentions via our searches, our actions via our purchases and interactions - what might it be able to say about us? Could it predict what we would do next? Could it determine how to influence us to take certain actions?</p><p>Yes - but “yes” wouldn’t make for a particularly compelling story in itself. Instead, I’d want to drill a level deeper and remind myself that any technology is a reflection of the people who built it. So even if all those datapoints were loaded into the system, a person who fell outside of the parameters the designers thought to measure or look for might not be as predictable in the system. The designer’s answer, in turn, might be to incentivize people to act within the frameworks they’d built: to make them conform to the data model. (Modern marketing already doesn’t stray too far from this idea.) The people who are not compliant, who resist those incentives, are the only ones who can bring down the system. In the end, only the non-conformists, in this story and in life, are truly free, and are the flag-bearers of freedom for everyone else.</p><p></p><p>The corpus of images used to power DALL-E 2 is scraped from the internet; the corpus of code for GitHub Copilot is scraped from open source software. There are usage implications here, of course: I did not grant permission for my code, my drawings, or my photographs to form the basis of someone else’s work. But a human artist also draws on everything they’ve encountered, and we tend not to worry about that (unless the re-use becomes undeniably obviously centered on one work in particular). An engineer relies on “best practices” and “patterns” that were developed by others, and we actively encourage that (unless, again, it turns the corner and becomes plagiarism of a single source). Where should we draw the line, legally and conceptually?</p><p>I think there is a line, and it’s in part because OpenAI is building a commercial, proprietary platform. The corpus of work translates into profit for them; if OpenAI’s software does wind up powering military applications, or if my mini science fiction story partially becomes true, it could also translate into real harm. The ethical considerations there can’t be brushed away.</p><p>What I’m not worried about: I don’t think AI is coming for the jobs of creative people. The corpus requires new art. I do think we will see AI-produced news stories, which are a natural evolution of the content aggregator and cheap reblogging sites we see today, but there will always be a need for deeply-reported journalism. I don’t think we’ll see AI-produced novels and other similar content, although I can imagine writers using them to help with their first drafts before they revise. Mostly, for creatives, this will be a tool rather than a replacement. At least, for another generation or so.</p><p>In the meantime, here’s a raccoon in a cowboy hat singing karaoke:</p><p></p>

<p>He’s not everyone’s cup of tea - but he often makes very good points - AND - he knows how to talk about a topic on his podcast in under 15 minutes rather than three hours (though this podcast at 1 hour is an exception). Still, worth a listen … or just buy his book - since he is essentially doing a Doctorow - reading his own book!</p>
<p>I THINK it was Hubspot that pretty much lead the way on ‘Content Marketing’ (defined the category as Lockhead would have it). It felt wrong then … still does … maybe finally some sanity will prevail?</p>

  <p>Summary:      Last week I spoke at the memorial service for Craig Burton, a giant of the tech industry and my close friend. Here are, slightly edited, my remarks.</p>

<p>
    When I got word that Craig Burton had died, the news wasn't unexpected. He'd been ill with brain cancer for a some time and we knew his time was limited. Craig is a great man, a good person, a valued advisor, and a fabulous friend. Craig's life is an amazing story of success, challenge, and overcoming. 
</p>

<p>
    I first met Craig when I was CIO for Utah and he was the storied co-founder of Novell and the Burton Group. Dave Politis <a href="https://newsroom.siliconslopes.com/news/silicon-slopes-loses-a-tech-industry-og-rip-craig-burton/">calls Craig "one of Utah's tech industry Original Gangsters"</a>. I was a bit intimidated. Craig was starting a new venture with his longtime friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/artnevarez/?originalSubdomain=mx">Art Navarez</a>, and wanted to talk to me about it. That first meeting was where I came to appreciate his famous wit and sharp, insightful mind. Over time, our relationship grew and I came to rely him whenever I had a sticky problem to unravel. One of Craig's talents was throwing out the conventional thinking and starting over to reframe a problem in ways that made solutions tractable. That's what he'd done at Novell when he moved up the stack to avoid the tangle of competing network standards and create a market in network services. 
</p>

<p>
    When Steve Fulling and I started <a href="http://www.kynetx.com">Kynetx</a> in 2007 we knew we needed Craig as an advisor. He mentored us—sometimes gently and sometimes with a swift kick. He advised us. He dove into the technology and developed applications, even though he wasn't a developer. He introduced us to one of our most important investors, and now good friend, Roy Avondet. He was our biggest cheerleader and we were grateful for his friendship and help. Craig wasn't just an advisor. He was fully engaged.
</p>


<p>
    One of Craig's favorite words was "ubiquity" and he lived his life consistent with that philosophy. Let me share three stories about Craig from the Kynetx days that I hope show a little bit of his personality:
</p>

 
     
        Steve, Craig, and I had flown to Seattle to meet with Microsoft. Flying with Craig is always an adventure, but that's another story. We met with some people on Microsoft's identity team including <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/12/in_memory_of_kim_cameron.shtml">Kim Cameron</a>, Craig's longtime friend and Microsoft's Chief Identity Architect. During the meeting someone, a product manager, said something stupid and you could just see Craig come up in his chair. Kim, sitting in the corner, was trying not to laugh because he knew what was coming. Craig, very deliberately and logically, took the PM's argument apart. He wasn't mean; he was patient. But his logic cut like a knife. He could be direct. Craig always took charge of a room.
     
    
	<a></a>

        We hosted a developer conference at Kynetx called <a href="https://www.windley.com/tags/impact">Impact</a>. Naturally, Craig spoke. But Craig couldn't just give a standard presentation. He sat, in a big chair on the stage and "held forth". He even had his guitar with him and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m5r5sS2AZw">sang during the presentation</a>. Craig loved music. The singing was all Craig. He couldn't just speak, he had to entertain and make people laugh and smile.
     
    
	<a></a>

        At Kynetx, we hosted Free Lunch Friday every week. We'd feed lunch to our team, developers using our product, and anyone else who wanted to come visit the office. We usually brought in something like Jimmy Johns, Costco pizza, or J Dawgs. Not Craig. He and Judith took over the entire break room (for the entire building), brought in portable burners, and cooked a multi-course meal. It was delicious and completely over the top. I can see him with his floppy hat and big, oversized glasses, flamboyant and happy. Ubiquity!

<p>
    I've been there with Craig in some of the highest points of his life and some of the lowest.  I've seen him meet his challenges head on and rise above them. Being his friend was hard sometimes. He demanded much of his friends. But he returned help, joy, and, above all, love. He regretted that his choices hurt others besides himself. Craig loved large and completely.
</p>

<p>
    The last decade of Craig's life was remarkable. Craig, in 2011, was a classic tragic hero: noble, virtuous, and basking in past success but with a seemingly fatal flaw. But Craig's story didn't end in 2011. Drummond Reed, a mutual friend and fellow traveler wrote this for Craig's service:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>
        Ten years ago, when Craig was at one of the lowest points in his life, I had the chance to join a small group of his friends to help intervene and steer him back on an upward path. It was an extraordinary experience I will never forget, both because of what I learned about Craig's amazing life, and what it proved about the power of love to change someone's direction. In fact Craig went on from there not just to another phase of his storied career, but to reconnect and marry his high school sweetheart.
    </p>
    
	<a></a>

    <p>
        Craig found real happiness in those last years of his life—and he deserved it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Craig Burton was a mountain of a man, and a mountain of mind. And he moved the mountains of the internet for all of us. The digital future will be safer, richer, and more rewarding for all of us because of the gifts he gave us.
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
    Starting with that intervention, Craig began a long, painful path to eventual happiness and redemption.
</p>
 
     
        Craig overcame his internal demons. This was a battle royale. He had help from friends and family (especially his sisters), but in the end, he had to make the change, tamp down his darkest urges, and face his problems head on. His natural optimism and ability to see things realistically helped. When he finally turned his insightful mind on himself, he began to make progress.
     
     
        Craig had to live and cope with chronic health challenges, many of which were the result of decisions he'd made earlier in his life. Despite the limitations they placed on him, he met them with his usual optimism and love of life.
     
     
        Craig refound his faith. I'm not sure he ever really lost it, but he couldn't reconcile some of his choices with what he believed his faith required of him. In 2016, he decided to rejoin the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. I was privileged to be able to baptize him. A great honor, that he was kind enough to give me.
     
     
        Craig also refound love and his high school sweetheart, Paula. The timing couldn't have been more perfect. Earlier and Craig wouldn't have been ready. Later and it likely would have been too late. They were married in 2017 and later had the marriage sealed in the <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/temples/details/seoul-korea-temple?lang=eng">Seoul Korea Temple</a>. Craig and Paula were living in Seoul at the time, engaged in another adventure. While Craig loved large, I believe he may have come to doubt that he was worthy of love himself. Paula gave him love and a reason to strive for a little more in the last years of his life.
     
    
	<a></a>
	Craig and Paula (click to enlarge)

 

<p>
    As I think about the last decade of Craig's life and his hard work to set himself straight, I'm reminded of the parable of the <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/20?lang=eng">Laborers in the Vineyard</a>. In that parable, Jesus compares the Kingdom of Heaven to a man hiring laborers for his vineyard. He goes to the marketplace and hires some, promising them a penny. He goes back later, at the 6th and 9th hours, and hires more. Finally he hires more laborers in the 11th hour. When it comes time to pay them, he gives everyone the same wage—a penny. The point of the parable is that it doesn't matter so much when you start the journey, but where you end up. 
</p>

<p>
    <a href="https://www.windley.com/my_faith">I'm a believer</a> in Jesus Christ and the power of his atonement and resurrection. I know Craig was too. He told me once that belief had given him the courage and hope to keep striving when all seemed lost. Craig knew the highest of the highs. He knew the lowest of the lows. The last few years of his life were among the happiest I ever saw him experience. He was a new man. In the end, Craig ended up in a good place.
</p>

<p>
    I will miss my friend, but I'm eternally grateful for his life and example.

<p>先週に引き続き、シリーズ「徹底考察、ブロックチェーンは人類を幸せにするのか」の第3回として分散IDの歴史第2弾が日経クロステックに掲載されました。「<a href="https://xtech.nikkei.com/atcl/nxt/column/18/02132/072900003/">中央集権IDから分散IDに至るまで、歴史は繰り返す</a>」です。前回はW3C DIDとXRIの対比を見ましたが、今回はいよいよOpenIDの話です。OpenIDの背景にある思想などが書いてあるものは少ないので、OpenIDは中央集権という主張をされるかたは、まずはこのあたりを読んですこし考えてから話していただけるとよろしいかと思います。</p>



<p>目次は以下のような感じです。</p>



  （導入部）  「自己主権」「自主独立」を体現するOpenIDの思想  Account URI：メールアドレスは打てるけれどもURLは打てない問題  the ‘acct’ URIの概要  the ‘acct’ URI のResolution    OpenID Connectとthe ‘acct’ URIとの関係  SIOPとアルゴリズム的に生成されるメタデータ文書  DIDは権力の分散に寄与するのか～歴史は繰り返す

 Building a comments system is really hard. I tried to build one for Known, which powers my website, but found that spammers circumvented it surprisingly easily. You can flag spam using Akismet (which was built for WordPress but works across platforms), but this process tends to require you to pre-screen comments and make them public after the fact.

<p></p><p>One of my most controversial opinions is that private schools should not be allowed. Quite how controversial is always a surprise to me: from my perspective it feels very straightforward.</p><p>In a nutshell, my argument comes down to the following complementary ideas:</p>  Every child deserves to have an equal start in life. 
 As a society, we are better off <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/08/01/upshot/rich-poor-friendships.html">if people from different backgrounds mix, interact, and get to know each other as early as possible</a>. 
 Every system of inequality is built around disenfranchisement and blocking access to resources. Giving everyone access to the same education and the connections that inevitably develop while attending an institution helps dismantle these systems. 
 If the rich are forced to use the same system as the poor, the overall standard of education will rise for everyone. 
 Education is a human right. 
 <p>Does this fly in the face of American individualism? Sure, probably. Will it result in a society that is both culturally and financially richer? I think so.</p><p>As far as I can tell, the arguments for private education come down to the perceived right to perpetuate inequality by gating a special education system for people with wealth, a defense of American individualism at the expense of community, and sometimes the adjoining right to perpetuate exclusionary values systems. I’m not particularly interested in protecting any of those things.</p><p>It’s certainly true that public education needs more funding, more resources, and stronger frameworks around (for example) special needs education. I don’t think the answer to these problems is private alternatives: instead, I think we solve them by providing stronger support for public infrastructure. And one of the ways we guarantee this support is by forcing people with wealth and resources to use the same infrastructure as everybody else.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@robin_rednine?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">ROBIN WORRALL</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/school-uniform?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p>

<p>This post shows how to enable, disable or remove Azure AD user accounts using Microsoft Graph and a client credentials client. The Microsoft Graph client uses an application scope and application client. This is also possible using a delegated client. If using an application which has no user, an application scope is used to authorize the client. Using a delegated scope requires a user and a web authentication requesting the required scope and a user consent.</p>



<p>History</p>



<p>2022-08-02 : Fixed incorrect conclusion about application client and AccountEnabled permission, feedback from Stephan van Rooij</p>



Image: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/overview">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/overview</a>



<p>Microsoft Graph with an application scope can be used to update, change, edit user accounts in an Azure AD tenant. The MsGraphService class is used to implement the Graph client using OAuth client credentials. This requires a user secret or a client certificate. The client uses the default scope and no consent is required or can be used because no user is involved. </p>


  public MsGraphService(IConfiguration configuration,
	ILogger&lt;MsGraphService&gt; logger)
{
	_groups = configuration.GetSection("Groups").Get&lt;List&lt;GroupsConfiguration&gt;&gt;();
	_logger = logger;
	string[]? scopes = configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("AadGraph:Scopes")?.Split(' ');
	var tenantId = configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("AadGraph:TenantId");

	// Values from app registration
	var clientId = configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("AadGraph:ClientId");
	var clientSecret = configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("AadGraph:ClientSecret");

	_federatedDomainDomain = configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("FederatedDomain");

	var options = new TokenCredentialOptions
	{
		AuthorityHost = AzureAuthorityHosts.AzurePublicCloud
	};

	// https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.identity.clientsecretcredential
	var clientSecretCredential = new ClientSecretCredential(
		tenantId, clientId, clientSecret, options);

	_graphServiceClient = new GraphServiceClient(clientSecretCredential, scopes);
}
  


<p></p>



<p>Option 1 Update User AccountEnabled property </p>



<p>By setting the AccountEnabled property, a user account can be updated and can be enabled or disabled. The User.ReadWrite.All permission is required for this.</p>


  user.GivenName = userModel.FirstName;
user.Surname = userModel.LastName;
user.DisplayName = $"{userModel.FirstName} {userModel.LastName}";
user.AccountEnabled = userModel.IsActive;

await _msGraphService.UpdateUserAsync(user);
  


<p>The Graph user can then be updated.</p>


  public async Task&lt;User&gt; UpdateUserAsync(User user)
{
	return await _graphServiceClient.Users[user.Id]
	   .Request()
	   .UpdateAsync(user);
}
  


<p></p>



<p>Option 2 Delete User</p>



<p>A user can also be completely removed and deleted from the Azure AD tenant.</p>



<p>Disadvantages</p>



  User is deleted and would need to add the account again if the user account is “reactivated”  



<p>The user can be deleted using the following code:</p>


  public async Task DeleteUserAsync(string userId)
{
	await _graphServiceClient.Users[userId]
	   .Request()
	   .DeleteAsync();
}
  


<p>Option 3 Remove Security groups for user and leave the account enabled</p>



<p>Deleting or disabling a user is normally not an option because a user might and probably does have access to further applications. After deleting a user, the user cannot be reactivated, but must sign up again. Setting AccountEnabled to false disables the whole account.</p>



<p>Another option instead of deleting/disabling the user is to use group memberships for access to different Azure services. When access to different services need to be removed or disabled, the user can be removed from the groups which are required to access service X or whatever. This will only work if groups are used to control the access to the different services in AAD or  Office etc. The following code checks if the user has access to the explicit groups and removes the memberships if required. This works well and does not change the user settings for further services in Azure AD, or office which are outside the scope.</p>


  public async Task RemoveUserFromAllGroupMemberships(string userId)
{
	var currentGroupIds = await GetGraphUserMemberGroups(userId);
	var currentGroupIdsList = currentGroupIds.ToList();

	// Only delete specific groups we defined in this app.
	foreach (var group in _groups)
	{
		if(currentGroupIdsList.Contains(group.GroupId))
		// remove group
		await RemoveUserFromGroup(userId, group.GroupId);
		currentGroupIds.Remove(group.GroupId);
	}
}
  


<p>The group membership for the user is deleted. </p>


  private async Task RemoveUserFromGroup(string userId, string groupId)
{
	try
	{
		await _graphServiceClient.Groups[groupId]
			.Members[userId]
			.Reference
			.Request()
			.DeleteAsync();
	}
	catch (Exception ex)
	{
		_logger.LogError(ex, "{Error} RemoveUserFromGroup", ex.Message);
	}
}
  


<p>Disadvantages</p>



  Applications must use security groups for access control  



<p>For this to work, the groups must be used to force the authorization. This requires some IT management.</p>

<p><a href="https://19thnews.org"></a></p><p>I didn’t make a big announcement about it, but for the last few months I’ve been working as the CTO at <a href="https://19thnews.org">The 19th</a>, a nonprofit newsroom that reports on stories at the intersection of gender, politics, and policy.</p><p>It was a necessary move for me: I needed stronger work/life balance for my own health, and I also wanted to feel like I was helping in the midst of a very tumultuous social and political climate. It was also a move back into the core ideas my career has been built on.</p><p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/new-media-outlet-covering-the-intersection-of-women-and-politics-launches-as-2020-election-kicks-off/2020/01/25/34c2a2ac-3ee9-11ea-baca-eb7ace0a3455_story.html">The 19th was launched in January 2020</a> by veterans of the Texas Tribune and ProPublica who understood the need to report stories from a more diverse perspective than is normally offered by an industry <a href="https://womensmediacenter.com/news-features/why-white-male-dominance-of-news-media-is-so-persistent">still dominated by white men</a>. I’ve been following it from the beginning as a prominent subscription in my RSS reader, and was deeply impressed by the detailed, empathetic, unsensational reporting.</p><p>The 19th’s technical platform is largely based on self-hosted WordPress, with some interesting theme modifications that allow for visualizations and in-page interactivity. (Did I immediately add <a href="https://indieweb.org/microformats">simple microformats support</a> to articles as soon as I arrived? Yes, I did.) Importantly for me, the team cares about the same privacy issues I do: particularly in an environment where <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/why-some-fear-that-big-tech-data-could-become-a-tool-for-abortion-surveillance">abortion-related surveillance is becoming a safety issue</a>, dealing with audience data intentionally is crucial.</p><p>Openness is core to what The 19th is. Its financial backers <a href="https://19thnews.org/membership/">are published in full</a>, so you know exactly whose is bankrolling the non-profit. Since the beginning, the newsroom has also made its content available <a href="https://19thnews.org/republishing-guidelines/">via a Creative Commons license</a> that allows anyone else to republish it for free. Those partners have included the Guardian, USA Today, Teen Vogue, PBS NewsHour, Ms. Magazine, RawStory, and many more. It could be you, too, if you wanted to: you can find the full HTML source to republish on every article page. Because The 19th’s newsroom <a href="https://19thnews.org/team/">is more diverse</a>, every republished article furthers its mission of improving representation in the news media overall.</p><p>It’s an obvious extension to this strategy to make our technology available as well, via a permissive open source license. That’s my ambition: to package up some of our supporting tools and make them available in a way that other newsrooms can take advantage of. If they have the technical capability to collaborate on building them, great; if not, they can still pick up the technology and use them. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity_in_open-source_software">Open source itself has a giant diversity problem</a>, and if we can apply an equity lens to building our technical community in the same way we build our journalistic ecosystem, perhaps we can be a part of the solution there, too.</p><p>I’ve long been a member of the <a href="https://indieweb.org">indieweb</a> community, which encourages everyone to own and control their own website and domain. Both technically and ideologically, the overlaps with news are obvious: every newsroom must own its relationship with its audience in order to build trust, understand their needs, and above all to build community. Trends on the web have been in the opposite direction for most of the last decade: social media platforms like Facebook seek to intermediate and monetize that relationship, stripping newsrooms of resources and undermining the ability of voters to receive information in the process. Building an independent website for representative news content and community, and then helping others to do the same, is an important mission.</p><p>Right now it’s a very small team: <a href="https://twitter.com/abbyblachman">Abby Blachman</a> and me. I’m looking for <a href="https://19thnews.org/19th-news-web-applications-engineer-job-posting/">a third member of the technology team</a> to help with everything I’ve discussed.</p><p>And so far, it’s been joyful. Abby is amazing; everyone is. I’ve never been part of an organization - least of all a remote team - that understands the need for a supportive culture so clearly. As an organization, it <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-the-19th-case-study-survived-pandemic-2021-2">continues to listen and evolve</a>. The people team - led by <a href="https://twitter.com/jayomiko">Jayo Miko Macasaquit</a> - has put procedures and benefits in place that I haven’t seen in organizations ten times the size. To build representative, empathetic news, you first need to build a representative, empathetic organization, and that’s what’s happening here. I hope they do more to tell their story and share what they’re doing, because it’s genuinely phenomenal.</p><p>I can’t believe my luck; it’s a real privilege to be on this team. I want to be a good ambassador: although I knew about the journalism, which should always be front and center, I wasn’t as familiar with the organization’s ecosystem and openness chops before I joined. It was the nicest of surprises, and I want to tell you more about it. We don’t have an internal blog right now, so from time to time I’ll discuss what we’ve been working on over here.</p><p>I’m also working on building some tools of my own to support my management process; the first is all about building a consistent culture of transparent feedback. More on that when I’m ready.</p><p>In the meantime, if you have any questions, I’d love to answer them. <a href="https://19thnews.org/19th-news-web-applications-engineer-job-posting/">And if you happen to be interested in our technology position, you should definitely apply.</a></p>

<p>People who don’t listen to podcasts often ask people who do: “When do you find time to listen?” For me it’s always on long walks or hikes. (I do a lot of cycling too, and have thought about listening then, but wind makes that impractical and cars make it dangerous.) For many years my trusty podcast player was one or another version of the Creative Labs MuVo which, as the ad says, is “ideal for dynamic environments.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>At some point I opted for the convenience of just using my phone. Why carry an extra, single-purpose device when the multi-purpose phone can do everything? That was OK until my Quixotic attachment to Windows Phone became untenable. Not crazy about either of the alternatives, I flipped a coin and wound up with an iPhone. Which, of course, lacks a 3.5mm audio jack. So I got an adapter, but now the setup was hardly “ideal for dynamic environments.” My headset’s connection to the phone was unreliable, and I’d often have to stop walking, reseat it, and restart the podcast.</p>
<p>If you are gadget-minded you are now thinking: “Wireless earbuds!” But no thanks. The last thing I need in my life is more devices to keep track of, charge, and sync with other devices. </p>
<p>I was about to order a new MuVo, and I might still; it’s one of my favorite gadgets ever. But on a recent hike, in a remote area with nobody else around, I suddenly realized I didn’t need the headset at all. I yanked it out, stuck the phone in my pocket, and could hear perfectly well. Bonus: Nothing jammed into my ears. </p>
<p>It’s a bit weird when I do encounter other hikers. Should I pause the audio or not when we cross paths? So far I mostly do, but I don’t think it’s a big deal one way or another.</p>
<p>Adding more devices to solve a device problem amounts to doing the same thing and expecting a different result. I want to remain alert to the possibility that subtracting devices may be the right answer.</p>
<p>There’s a humorous coda to this story. It wasn’t just the headset that was failing to seat securely in the Lightning port. Charging cables were also becoming problematic. A friend suggested a low-tech solution: use a toothpick to pull lint out of the socket. It worked! I suppose I could now go back to using my wired headset on hikes. But I don’t think I will.</p>

  This week at IETF 114 in Philadelphia, we held a Birds-of-a-Feather (BoF) session on JSON Web Proofs (JWPs). JSON Web Proofs are a JSON-based representation of cryptographic inputs and outputs that enable use of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), selective disclosure for minimal disclosure, and non-correlatable presentation. JWPs use the three-party model of Issuer, Holder, and Verifier […]

<p>This week at <a href="https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/114/">IETF 114 in Philadelphia</a>, we held a <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/bofreq-miller-json-web-proofs/">Birds-of-a-Feather (BoF) session on JSON Web Proofs (JWPs)</a>.  JSON Web Proofs are a JSON-based representation of cryptographic inputs and outputs that enable use of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), selective disclosure for minimal disclosure, and non-correlatable presentation.  JWPs use the three-party model of Issuer, Holder, and Verifier utilized by Verifiable Credentials.</p>
<p>The BoF asked to reinstate the IETF <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/jose/">JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) working group</a>.  We asked for this because the JOSE working group participants already have expertise creating simple, widely-adopted JSON-based cryptographic formats, such as JSON Web Signature (JWS), JSON Web Encryption (JWE), and JSON Web Key (JWK).  The JWP format would be a peer to JWS and JWE, reusing elements that make sense, while enabling use of new cryptographic algorithms whose inputs and outputs are not representable in the existing JOSE formats.</p>
<p>Presentations given at the BoF were:</p>

<p>You can view the BoF minutes at <a href="https://notes.ietf.org/notes-ietf-114-jwp">https://notes.ietf.org/notes-ietf-114-jwp</a>.  A useful discussion ensued after the presentations.  Unfortunately, we didn’t have time to finish the BoF in the one-hour slot. The BoF questions unanswered in the time allotted would have been along the lines of “Is the work appropriate for the IETF?”, “Is there interest in the work?”, and “Do we want to adopt the <a href="https://github.com/json-web-proofs/json-web-proofs/blob/main/charter-ietf-jose-03.md">proposed charter</a>?”.  Discussion of those topics is now happening on the jose@ietf.org mailing list.  Join it at https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/jose to participate.  Roman Danyliw, the Security Area Director who sponsored the BoF, had suggested that we hold a virtual interim BoF to complete the BoF process before IETF 115 in London.  Hope to see you there!</p>

   Cleaning data with sqlite-utils and Datasette 
 I wrote a new tutorial for the Datasette website, showing how to use sqlite-utils to import a CSV file, clean up the resulting schema, fix date formats and extract some of the columns into a separate table. It's accompanied by a ten minute video originally recorded for the HYTRADBOI conference.

<p>Here’s the gist:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Journal conducted a comprehensive study that assesses and analyzes the broad array of cookies and other surveillance technology that companies are deploying on Internet users. It reveals that the tracking of consumers has grown both far more pervasive and far more intrusive than is realized by all but a handful of people in the vanguard of the industry.</p></blockquote>
<p>It gets worse:</p>
<blockquote><p>In between the Internet user and the advertiser, the Journal identified more than 100 middlemen—tracking companies, data brokers and advertising networks—competing to meet the growing demand for data on individual behavior and interests.The data on Ms. Hayes-Beaty’s film-watching habits, for instance, is being offered to advertisers on BlueKai Inc., one of the new data exchanges. “It is a sea change in the way the industry works,” says Omar Tawakol, CEO of BlueKai. “Advertisers want to buy access to people, not Web pages.” The Journal examined the 50 most popular U.S. websites, which account for about 40% of the Web pages viewed by Americans. (The Journal also tested its own site,&nbsp;<a title="http://WSJ. " href="http://wsj.com/">WSJ.com</a>.) It then analyzed the tracking files and programs these sites downloaded onto a test computer. As a group, the top 50 sites placed 3,180 tracking files in total on the Journal’s test computer. Nearly a third of these were innocuous, deployed to remember the password to a favorite site or tally most-popular articles. But over two-thirds—2,224—were installed by 131 companies, many of which are in the business of tracking Web users to create rich databases of consumer profiles that can be sold.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here’s what’s delusional about all this:&nbsp;There is no demand for tracking by individual customers. All the demand comes from advertisers — or from companies selling to advertisers.&nbsp;For now.</p>
<p>Here is the difference between an advertiser and an ordinary company just trying to sell stuff to customers: nothing. If a better way to sell stuff comes along — especially if customers like it better than this crap the Journal is reporting on — advertising is in trouble.</p></blockquote>
<p>In fact, I had been calling the tracking-based advertising business (now branded adtech or ad-tech) a bubble for some time. For example, in&nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/doc/2008/10/21/why-online-advertising-sucks-and-is-a-bubble/">Why online advertising sucks, and is a bubble</a>&nbsp;(31 October 2008) and&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.law.harvard.edu/doc/2009/03/23/after-the-advertising-bubble-bursts/">After the advertising bubble bursts</a>&nbsp;(23 March 2009). But I didn’t expect my own small voice to have much effect. But this was different.&nbsp;What They Know was written by a crack team of writers, researchers, and data visualizers. It was led by <a href="https://juliaangwin.com/">Julia Angwin</a>&nbsp;and truly Pulitzer-grade stuff. It&nbsp; was so well done, so deep, and so sharp, that I posted a follow-up report three months later, called <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2010/10/31/the-data-bubble-ii/">The Data Bubble II</a>. In that one, I wrote,</p>

<p>Two things I especially like about all this. First,&nbsp;<a href="http://online.wsj.com/search/term.html?KEYWORDS=JULIA+ANGWIN">Julia Angwin</a>&nbsp;and her team are doing a terrific job of old-fashioned investigative journalism here. Kudos for that. Second, the whole series stands on the side of readers. The second person voice (you,&nbsp;your) is directed to individual persons—the same persons who do not sit at the tables of decision-makers in this crazy new hyper-personalized advertising business.</p>
<p>To measure the delta of change in that business, start with&nbsp;<a href="http://battellemedia.com/">John Battelle</a>‘s&nbsp;Conversational Marketing&nbsp;series (<a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/2006/12/packaged_goods_media_vs_conversational_media_part_one_updated">post 1</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/2006/12/packaged_goods_media_v_conversational_media_part_two">post 2</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/2007/03/conversational_marketing_pgm_v_cm_part_3">post 3</a>) from early 2007, and then his post&nbsp;<a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/2010/10/identity_and_the_independent_web_">Identity and the Independent Web</a>, from last week. In the former he writes about how the need for companies to converse directly with customers and prospects is both inevitable and transformative. He even kindly links to&nbsp;<a href="http://cluetrain.com/">The Cluetrain Manifesto</a>&nbsp;(behind the phrase “brands are conversations”).</p></blockquote>
<p>It was obvious to me that this fine work would blow the adtech bubble to a fine mist. It was just a matter of when.</p>
<p>Over the years since, I’ve retained hope, if not faith. Examples:&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2016/04/09/the-data-bubble-redux/">The Data Bubble Redux</a>&nbsp;(9 April 2016), and&nbsp;<a href="http://j.mp/bubp0p">Is the advertising bubble finally starting to pop?</a> (9 May 2016, and <a href="http://j.mp/bblp0p">in Medium</a>).</p>
<p>Alas, the answer to that last one was no. By 2016, Julia and her team had long since disbanded, and the original links to the What They Know series began to fail. I don’t have exact dates for which failed when, but I do know that the trusty master link,&nbsp;wjs.com/wtk, began to 404 at some point. Fortunately, Julia has kept much of it alive at&nbsp;<a href="https://juliaangwin.com/category/portfolio/wall-street-journal/what-they-know/">https://juliaangwin.com/category/portfolio/wall-street-journal/what-they-know/</a>. Still, by the late Teens it was clear that even the best journalism wasn’t going to be enough—especially since the major publications had become adtech junkies. Worse, covering their own publications’ involvement in surveillance capitalism had become&nbsp;an untouchable topic for journalists. (One notable exception is Farhad Manjoo of The New York Times, whose <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/23/opinion/data-internet-privacy-tracking.html">coverage of the paper’s own tracking</a>&nbsp;was followed by a cutback in the practice.)</p>
<p>While I believe that most new laws for tech mostly protect yesterday from last Thursday, I share with many a hope for regulatory relief. I was especially jazzed about Europe’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">GDPR</a>, as you can read in&nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2018/05/12/gdpr/">GDPR will pop the adtech bubble</a> (12 May 2018) and&nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/vrm/2018/05/16/time/">Our time has come</a> (16 May 2018 in <a href="http://projectvrm.org">ProjectVRM</a>).</p>
<p>But I was wrong then too. Because&nbsp;adtech isn’t a bubble. It’s a death star in service of an evil empire that destroys privacy through every function it funds in the digital world.</p>
<p>That’s why I expect the <a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF00/20220720/115041/BILLS-117-8152-P000034-Amdt-1.pdf">American Data Privacy and Protection Act (H.R. 8152)</a>, even if it passes through both houses of Congress at full strength, to do jack shit. Or worse, to make our experience of life in the digital world even more complicated, by requiring us to opt-out, rather than opt-in (yep, it’s in the law—as a right, no less), to tracking-based advertising everywhere. And we know how well that’s been going. (<a href="https://marketoonist.com/2021/10/we-value-your-privacy.html">Read this whole post</a> by Tom Fishburne, the <a href="https://marketoonist.com/">Marketoonist</a>, for a picture of how less than zero progress has been made, and how venial and absurd “consent” gauntlets on websites have become.) Do a search for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gdpr+compliance">https://www.google.com/search?q=gdpr+compliance</a> to see how large the GDPR “compliance” business has become. Nearly all your 200+ million results will be for services selling obedience to the letter of the GDPR while death-star laser beams blow its spirit into spinning shards. Then expect that business to grow once the ADPPA is in place.</p>
<p>There is only thing that will save us from adtech’s death star.</p>
<p>That’s tech of our own. Our tech. Personal tech.</p>
<p>We did it in the physical world with the personal privacy tech we call clothing, shelter, locks, doors, shades, and shutters. We’ve barely started to make the equivalents for the digital world. But the digital world is only a few decades old. It will be around for dozens, hundreds, or thousands of decades to come. And adtech is still just a teenager. We can, must, and will do better.</p>
<p>All we need is the tech. Big Tech won’t do it for us. Nor will Big Gov.</p>
<p>The economics will actually help, because there are many business problems in the digital world that can only be solved from the customers’ side, with better signaling from demand to supply than adtech-based guesswork can ever provide. <a href="http://customercommons.org">Customer Commons</a> lists fourteen of those solutions, <a href="https://customercommons.org/solutions/">here</a>. Privacy is just one of them.</p>
<p>Use the Force, folks.</p>
<p>That Force is us.</p>

Making predictions for clients about the U.S. economy over the next several years, the memo also noted that changes in the percentage of Americans seeking jobs “should help push up the unemployment rate.””</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/21/business/amazon-one-medical-deal.html?smtyp=cur&amp;smid=tw-nytimes">Amazon to Acquire One Medical Clinics in Latest Push Into Health Care.</a> “One Medical, which is based in San Francisco, operates a network of primary care providers that offer in-office and virtual medical services, and is one of the leading competitors to a similar but smaller service Amazon had started to offer.” Exercise for the reader: should end-user healthcare provision be a place where you can make a lot of profit?</p> Climate <p><a href="https://grist.org/culture/when-time-is-short-review-timothy-beal-climate-doomer-religion/">Is accepting the end of humanity the key to climate action?

More than 200,000 people died and untold numbers of explosives were used. It’s a major problem across Europe that lingers to this day. The Royal Air Force and U.S. Army Air Force dropped 2.7 million tons of bombs on Europe during World War II alone.

There’s, of course, no provision included in the bill that works in the opposite direction.”</p> Covid <p><a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abp8715">The Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan was the early epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic.</a> “While there is insufficient evidence to define upstream events, and exact circumstances remain obscure, our analyses indicate that the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 occurred via the live wildlife trade in China, and show that the Huanan market was the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic.”</p><p><a href="https://19thnews.org/2022/07/covid-surge-nursing-home-residents-aarp/">COVID cases and deaths are spiking in nursing homes, AARP data shows.</a> “One in 35 nursing home residents tested positive for COVID-19 in June, a 27 percent increase from the previous month.

If they are not returned, my business would go bankrupt, my 15 employees would be let go, and 14 years of my life’s work lost and at the age of 49 years old, I would have to start over with nothing.” “Having my funds frozen has been devastating to me and my family both financially, mentally, and physically. I cannot sleep most nights and am over-whelmed with worry and dread for my family’s future. I have two small children. A 3-year-old daughter and a 2-year-old son. I am the sole bread winner for my family, and I pride myself on making smart financial and parental decisions for them to provide a better life and a bright/positive future.”</p><p><a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/books/a40654712/crypto-books-future/">How Crypto Is Evolving the Future of Books and Publishing.</a> ““Imagine when all of an author’s readers can suddenly make money as well,” says Margarita Guerrero, head of partner and publishing relations at the publishing startup Readl. “How much more would they be engaged?”” Seems like a complete misunderstanding of why people like books to me.</p><p><a href="https://startupstrats.substack.com/p/lost-at-opensea?utm_source=email">Lost at OpenSea.</a> “Like social audio, NFTs were a pandemic fad.

But Voyager marketed high-risk investments to retail depositors with promises of safety and (non-existent) insurance. To my mind, this isn’t just bad, it is criminal. But crypto is an unregulated, borderless space. Even if Voyager has lied to its customers and embezzled their funds, it is unclear what if any power national authorities have to hold it to account. And even though there will undoubtedly be a forest of lawsuits, the money is gone.”</p><p><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/47d338e2-3d3c-40ce-8a09-abfa25c16a7f">Crypto collapse reverberates widely among black American investors.</a> “A quarter of black American investors owned cryptocurrencies at the start of the year, compared with only 15 per cent of white investors, according to a survey by Ariel Investments and Charles Schwab. Black Americans were more than twice as likely to purchase cryptocurrency as their first investment. The value of those investments has imploded. The total market capitalisation of cryptocurrencies has plunged below $1tn from more than $3.2tn last year.

The dark bran bread sat at the bottom of a hierarchy that gave brown bread to farmers and servants and reserved white bread for the elite. Indeed, Englishpeople turned to horse bread during times of strife, and the abject poor likely ate it year round. And since horse bread was fed to laboring animals, humans who ate it were looked upon with disdain.”</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/28/arts/television/neighbours-end.html">After 37 Years, the Sunny World of ‘Neighbours’ Comes to an End.</a> “At that time, the world of “Neighbours” offered an antidote to the contentious impact of conservative, Thatcherite legislation in Britain, Carr said, which supported “do it yourself” economic policies that its opponents said widened inequality. “Neighbours” offered “a different, wildly positive vision of what a community could be,” Carr said. “Everyone tends to work together rather than be adversarial.”” As a kid, I loved it.</p><p><a href="https://electricliterature.com/announcing-the-shortlist-for-the-inaugural-ursula-k-le-guin-fiction-prize/">Announcing the Shortlist for the Inaugural Ursula K.

I wrote up a short  manifesto - you can <a href="https://www.python.org/nominations/elections/2022-python-software-foundation-board/nominees/simon-willison/">see that here</a> - but the voting system lets voters select as many candidates as they like, so it's possible I got in more on broad name recognition among the voters than based on what I wrote. I don't think there's a way to tell one way or the other.</p>
<p>I had my first board meeting on Wednesday, where I formally joined the board and got to vote on my first resolutions. This is my first time as a board member for a non-profit and I have learned a bunch already, with a lot more to go!</p>
<p>Board terms last three years. I expect it will take me at least a few months to get fully up to speed on how everything works.</p>
<p>As a board member, my <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/interested-in-running-for-the-psf-board-read-about-board-responsibilities-here/8564">primary responsibilities</a> are to show up to the meetings, vote on resolutions, act as an ambassador for the PSF to the Python community and beyond and help both set the direction for the PSF and ensure that the PSF meets its goals and holds true to its values.</p>
<p>I'm embarassed to admit that I wrote my election manifesto without a deep understanding of how the PSF operates and how much is possible for it to get done. Here's the section I wrote about my goals should I be elected:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe there are problems facing the Python community that require dedicated resources beyond volunteer labour. I'd like the PSF to invest funding in the following areas in particular:</p>
 
 
Improve Python onboarding. In coaching new developers I've found that the initial steps to getting started with a Python development environment can be a difficult hurdle to cross. I'd like to help direct PSF resources to tackling this problem, with a goal of making the experience of starting to learn Python as smooth as possible, no matter what platform the learner is using. 
 
Make Python a great platform for distributing software. In building my own application, Datasette, in Python I've seen how difficult it can be to package up a Python application so that it can be installed by end-users, who aren't ready to install Python and learn pip in order to try out a new piece of software. I've researched solutions for this for my own software using Homebrew, Docker, an Electron app and WASM/Pyodide. I'd like the PSF to invest in initiatives and documentation to make this as easy as possible, so that one of the reasons to build with Python is that distributing an application to end-users is already a solved problem. 
 
</blockquote>
<p>I still think these are good ideas, and I hope to make progress on them during my term as a director - but I'm not going to start arguing for new initiatives until I've learned the ropes and fully understood the PSF's abilities, current challenges and existing goals.</p>
<p>In figuring out how the board works, one of the most useful pages I stumbled across was <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/records/board/resolutions/">this list of resolutions</a> voted on by the board, dating back to 2001. There are over 1,600 of them! Browsing through them gave me a much better idea of the kind of things the board has the authority to do.</p>
 Scraping data into Datasette Lite 
<p>Because everything looks like a nail when you have a good hammer, I explored the board resolutions by loading them into <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a>. I tried a new trick this time: I scraped data from that page into a CSV file, then loaded up that CSV file in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/May/4/datasette-lite/">Datasette Lite</a> via a GitHub Gist.</p>
<p>My scraper isn't perfect - it misses about 150 resolutions because they don't exactly fit the format it expects, but it was good enough for a proof of concept. I wrote that in a Jupyter Notebook which you can <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/027408c5df8a579053957ceaaef3a144">see here</a>.</p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/71b03ca3688c8f37fe1b35859ebc458b">the CSV in a Gist</a>. The great thing about Gists is that GitHub serve those files with the <code>access-control-allow-origin: *</code> HTTP header, which means you can load them cross-domain.</p>
<p><a href="https://lite.datasette.io/?csv=https%3A%2F%2Fgist.githubusercontent.com%2Fsimonw%2F71b03ca3688c8f37fe1b35859ebc458b%2Fraw%2Fd3ca708e5d6242848201d1d4c1c2ddbba15c4d28%2Fpsf-resolutions.csv#/data/psf-resolutions">Here's what you get</a> if you paste the URL to that CSV into Datasette Lite (using <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Jun/20/datasette-lite-csvs/">this new feature</a> I added last month):</p>
<p></p>
<p>And here's <a href="https://lite.datasette.io/?csv=https%3A%2F%2Fgist.githubusercontent.com%2Fsimonw%2F71b03ca3688c8f37fe1b35859ebc458b%2Fraw%2Fd3ca708e5d6242848201d1d4c1c2ddbba15c4d28%2Fpsf-resolutions.csv#/data?sql=with+filtered+as+%28%0A++select+*+from%0A++++%5Bpsf-resolutions%5D%0A++where%0A++++%22dollars%22+is+not+null%0A++++and+%22text%22+like+%27%25%27+%7C%7C+%3Asearch+%7C%7C+%27%25%27%0A%29%0Aselect%0A++%27Total%3A+%24%27+%7C%7C+printf%28%27%25%2Cd%27%2C+sum%28dollars%29%29+as+text%2C%0A++null+as+date%0Afrom+filtered%0Aunion+all%0Aselect%0A++text%2C+date%0Afrom+filtered%3B&amp;search=Nigeria">a SQL query</a> that shows the sum total dollar amount from every resolution that mentions "Nigeria":</p>
  with filtered as (
  select * from
    [psf-resolutions]
  where
    "dollars" is not null
    and "text" like '%' || :search || '%'
)
select
  'Total: $' || printf('%,d', sum(dollars)) as text,
  null as date
from filtered
union all
select
  text, date
from filtered;  
<p></p>
<p>I'm using a new-to-me trick here: I use a CTE to filter down to just the rows I am interested in, then I create a first row that sums the dollar amounts as the <code>text</code> column and leaves the <code>date</code> column <code>null</code>, then unions that against the rows from the query.</p>
<p>Important note: These numbers aren't actually particularly useful. Just because the PSF board voted on a resolution does not mean that the money made it to the grantee - there are apparently situations where the approved grant may not be properly claimed and transferred. Also, my scraper logic isn't perfect. Plus the PSF spends a whole lot of money in ways that don't show up in these resolutions.</p>
<p>So this is a fun hack, and a neat way to start getting a general idea of how the PSF works, but any numbers it produces should not be taken as the absolute truth.</p>
<p>As a general pattern though, I really like this workflow of generating CSV files, saving them to a Gist and then opening them directly in Datasette Lite. It provides a way to use Datasette to share and explore data without needing to involve any server-side systems (other than GitHub Gists) at all!</p>
 Big-endian bugs in sqlite-fts4 
<p><a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-fts4">sqlite-fts4</a> is a small Python library I wrote that adds SQLite functions for calculating relevance scoring for full-text search using the FTS4 module that comes bundled with SQLite. I described that project in detail in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2019/Jan/7/exploring-search-relevance-algorithms-sqlite/">Exploring search relevance algorithms with SQLite</a>.</p>
<p>It's a dependency of <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/">sqlite-utils</a> so it has a pretty big install base, despite being relatively obscure.</p>
<p>This week I had a fascinating bug report from Sarah Julia Kriesch: <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-fts4/issues/6">Test test_underlying_decode_matchinfo fails on PPC64 and s390x on openSUSE</a>.</p>
<p>The <code>s390x</code> is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_on_IBM_Z">IBM mainframe architecture</a> and it uses a big-endian byte order, unlike all of the machines I use which are little-endian.</p>
<p>This is the first time I've encountered a big-endian v.s. little-endian bug in my entire career! I was excited to dig in.</p>
<p>Here's the relevant code:</p>
  def decode_matchinfo(buf): 
     # buf is a bytestring of unsigned integers, each 4 bytes long 
     return struct.unpack("I" * (len(buf) // 4), buf)  
<p>SQLite FTS4 provides a <code>matchinfo</code> binary string which you need to decode in order to calculate the relevance score. This code uses the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html">struct</a> standard library module to unpack that binary string into a list of integers.</p>
<p>My initial attempt at fixing this turned out to be entirely incorrect.</p>
<p>I didn't have a big-endian machine available for testing, and I assumed that the problem was caused by Python interpreting the bytes as the current architecture's byte order. So I applied this fix:</p>
     return struct.unpack("&gt;" + ("I" * (len(buf) // 4)), buf) 
<p>The <code>&gt;</code> prefix there ensures that <code>struct</code> will always interpret the bytes as little-endian. I wrote up <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/python/struct-endianness">a TIL</a> and <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-fts4/releases/1.0.2">shipped 1.0.2</a> with the fix.</p>
<p>Sarah promptly got back to me and reported some <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-fts4/issues/6#issuecomment-1198566258">new failing tests</a>.</p>
<p>It turns out my fix was entirely incorrect - in fact, I'd broken something that previously was working just fine.</p>
<p>The clue is in the SQLite <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/fts3.html#matchinfo">documentation for matchinfo</a> (which I really should have checked):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>matchinfo</code> function returns a blob value. If it is used within a query that does not use the full-text index (a "query by rowid" or "linear scan"), then the blob is zero bytes in size. Otherwise, the blob consists of zero or more 32-bit unsigned integers in machine byte-order (emphasis mine).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looking more closely at the original bug report, the test that failed was this one:</p>
 @pytest.mark.parametrize(
    "buf,expected",
    [
        (
            b"\x01\x00\x00\x00\x02\x00\x00\x00\x02\x00\x00\x00\x02\x00\x00\x00",
            (1, 2, 2, 2),
        )
    ],
)
def test_underlying_decode_matchinfo(buf, expected):
    assert expected == decode_matchinfo(buf) 
<p>That test hard-codes a little-endian binary string and checks the output of my <code>decode_matchinfo</code> function. This is obviously going to fail on a big-endian system.</p>
<p>So my original behaviour was actually correct: I was parsing the string using the byte order of the architecture, and SQLite was providing the string in the byte order of the architecture. The only bug was in my test.</p>
<p>I reverted my previous fix and fixed the test instead:</p>
 @pytest.mark.parametrize(
    "buf,expected",
    [
        (
            b"\x01\x00\x00\x00\x02\x00\x00\x00\x02\x00\x00\x00\x02\x00\x00\x00"
            if sys.byteorder == "little"
            else b"\x00\x00\x00\x01\x00\x00\x00\x02\x00\x00\x00\x02\x00\x00\x00\x02",
            (1, 2, 2, 2),
        )
    ],
)
def test_underlying_decode_matchinfo(buf, expected):
    assert expected == decode_matchinfo(buf) 
<p><code>sys.byteorder</code> reports the byte order of the host system, so this test now passes on both little-endian and big-endian systems.</p>
<p>There was one remaining challenge: how to test this? I wasn't going to make the same mistake of shipping a fix that hadn't actually been exercised on the target architecture a second time.</p>
<p>After quite a bit of research (mainly throwing the terms <code>docker</code> and <code>s390x</code> into the GitHub code search engine and seeing what I could find) I figured out a fix. It turns out you can use Docker and QEMU to run an emulated <code>s390x</code> system - both on a Mac loptop and in GitHub Actions.</p>
<p>Short version:</p>
 <code>docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static:register --reset
docker run -it multiarch/ubuntu-core:s390x-focal /bin/bash
</code> 
<p>For the longer version, check my TIL: <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/docker/emulate-s390x-with-qemu">Emulating a big-endian s390x with QEMU</a>.</p>

<p>A visitor to <a href="https://www.flickr.com/search/?sort=interestingness-desc&amp;text=windowseat%20docsearls">aerial photos on my Flickr site</a> asked me where one should sit on a passenger plane to shoot pictures like mine. This post expands on what I wrote back to him.</p>
<p>Here’s the main thing: you want a window seat on the side of the plane shaded from the Sun, and away from the wing. Sun on plane windows highlights all the flaws, scratches, and dirt that are typical features of airplane windows. It’s also best to have a clear view of the ground. In front of the wing is also better than behind, because jet engine exhaust at low altitudes distorts the air, causing blur in a photo. (At high altitudes this problem tends to go away.) So, if you are traveling north in the morning, you want a seat on the left side of the plane (where the seat is usually called A). And the reverse if you’re flying south.</p>
<p>Here in North America, when flying west I like to be on the right side, and when flying east I like to be on the left, because the whole continent is far enough north of the Equator for the Sun, at least in the middle hours of the day, to be in the south. (There are exceptions, however, such as early and late in the day in times of year close to the Summer Solstice, when the Sun rises and sets far north of straight east and west.) This photo, of massive snows atop mountains in Canada’s arctic Baffin Island, was shot on a flight from London to Denver, with the sun on the left side of the plane. I was on the right:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/2023618909"></a></p>
<p>As for choosing seats, the variety of variables is extreme. That’s because almost every airline flies different kinds of planes, and even those that fly only one kind of plane may fly many different seat layouts. For example, there are thirteen different variants of the 737 model, across four generations. And, even within one model of plane, there may be three or four different seat layouts, even within one airline. For example, <a href="https://seatguru.com/airlines/United_Airlines/information.php">United flies</a> fifteen different widebody jets: four 767s, six 777s, and four 787s, each with a different seat layout. It also flies nineteen narrowbody jets, five regional jets, and seven turboprops, all with different seat layouts as well.</p>
<p>So I always go to <a href="http://SeatGuru.com">SeatGuru.com</a> for a better look at the seat layout for a plane than what United (or any airline) will tell me on their seat selection page when I book a flight online. On the website, you enter the flight number and the date, and SeatGuru will give you the seat layout, with a rating or review for every seat.</p>
<p>This is critical because some planes’ window seats are missing a window, or have a window that is “misaligned,” meaning it faces the side of a seat back, a bulkhead, or some other obstruction. See here:</p>
<p><a href="https://seatguru.com/airlines/United_Airlines/United_Airlines_Boeing_737-700_C.php"></a></p>
<p>Some planes have other challenges, such&nbsp;as the electrically dimmable windows on Boeing 787 “Dreamliners.” I wrote about the challenges of those <a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2017/09/16/787/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Now, if you find yourself with a seat that’s over the wing and facing the Sun, good photography is still possible, as you see in <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/29487051304/in/album-72157674770569965/">this shot of this sunset at altitude</a>:</p>
<p></p>
<p>One big advantage of life in our Digital Age is that none of the airlines, far as I know, will hassle you for shooting photos out windows with your phone. That’s because, while in the old days some airlines forbid photography on planes, shooting photos with phones, constantly, is now normative in the extreme, everywhere. (It’s still bad form to shoot airline personnel in planes, though, and you will get hassled for that.)</p>
<p>So, if you’re photographically inclined, have fun.</p>

  <p>One of the most interesting lessons from the pandemic is the harm that can be caused by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dredging">p-hacking</a>.  A paper with errors related to p-hacking that hasn’t been peer-reviewed is promoted by one or more people with millions of followers on social media and then some of those followers suffer horrible outcomes because they had a false sense of security.  Maybe the authors of the paper did not even realize the problem but for whatever reason, the social media rock stars felt the need to spread the misinformation.  And another very interesting lesson is that the social media rock stars seem to almost never issue a correction after the paper is reviewed and rejected.</p>

<p>To illustrate p-hacking with a non-serious example, I am using real public data with my experience attending drop-in hockey.</p>

<p>I wanted to know if goalies tended to show up more or less frequently on any particular day of the week because it is more fun to play when at least one goalie shows up.  I collected 85 independent samples.</p>

<p>For all days, there were 27 days with 1 goalie and 27 days with 2 goalies and 31 days with 0 goalies.</p>

<p>Our test procedure will define the test statistic X = the number of days that at least one goalie registered.</p>

<p>I am not smart so instead of committing to a hypothesis to test prior to looking at the data, I cheat and look at the data first and notice that the numbers for Tuesday look especially low.  So, I focus on goalie registrations on Tuesdays.  Using the data above for all days, the null hypothesis  is that the probability that at least one goalie registered on a Tuesday is 0.635.</p>

<p>For perspective, taking 19 samples for Tuesday would give an expected value of 12 samples where at least 1 goalie registered.</p>

<p>Suppose we wanted to propose an alternative hypothesis that p &lt; 0.635 for Tuesday.  What is the rejection region of values that would refute the null hypothesis (p=0.635)?</p>

<p>Let’s aim for α = 0.05 as the level of significance.  This means that (pretending that I had not egregiously cherry-picked data beforehand) we want there to be less than a 5% chance that the experimental result would occur inside the rejection region if the null hypothesis was true (Type I error).</p>

<p>For a binomial random variable X, the pmf b(x; n, p) is</p>



  <code>def factorial(n)
  (1..n).inject(:*) || 1
end

def combination(n,k)
  factorial(n) / (factorial(k)*factorial(n-k))
end

def pmf(x,n,p)
  combination(n,x) * (p ** x) * ((1 - p) ** (n-x))
end
</code> 
 
<p>The cdf B(x; n, p) = P(X  x) is</p>



  <code>def cdf(x,n,p)
  (0..x).map {|i| pmf(i,n,p)}.sum
end
</code> 
 

<p>For n=19 samples, if x  9 was chosen as the rejection region, then α = P(X  9 when X ~ Bin(19, 0.635)) = 0.112</p>

  <code>2.4.10 :001 &gt; load 'stats.rb'
 =&gt; true 
2.4.10 :002 &gt; cdf(9,19,0.635)
 =&gt; 0.1121416295262306 
</code> 
 
<p>This choice is not good enough because even if the null hypothesis is true, there is a large 11% chance (again, pretending I had not cherry-picked the data) that the test statistic falls in the rejection region.</p>

<p>So, if we narrow the rejection region to x  8, then α = P(X  8 when X ~ Bin(19, 0.635)) = 0.047</p>

  <code>2.4.10 :003 &gt; cdf(8,19,0.635)
 =&gt; 0.04705965393607316
</code> 
 

<p>This rejection region satisfies the requirement of a 0.05 significance level.</p>

<p>The n=19 samples for Tuesday are [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 2, 0, 0].</p>

<p>Since x=8 falls within the rejection region, the null hypothesis is (supposedly) rejected for Tuesday samples.  So I announce to my hockey friends on social media “Beware! Compared to all days of the week, it is less likely that at least one goalie will register on a Tuesday!”</p>

<p></p>

<p>Before addressing the p-hacking, let’s first address another issue.  The experimental result was x = 8 which gave us a 0.047 probability of obtaining 8 or less days in a sample of 19 assuming that the null hypothesis (p=0.635) is true.  This result just barely makes the 0.05 cutoff by the skin of its teeth.  So, just saying that the null hypothesis was refuted with α = 0.05 does not reveal that it was barely refuted.  Therefore, it is much more informative to say the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value">p-value</a> was 0.047 and also does not impose a particular α on readers who want to draw their own conclusions.</p>

<p>Now let’s discuss the p-hacking problem.  I gave myself the impression that there was only a 5% chance that I would see a significant result even if the null hypothesis (p=0.635) were true.  However, since there is data for 5 days (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday), I could have performed 5 different tests.  If I chose that same p &lt; 0.635 alternative hypothesis for each, then there would similarly be a 5% chance of a significant result for each test.  The probability that all 5 tests would not be significant would be 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.77.  Therefore, the probability that at least one test would be significant is 1 - 0.77 = 0.23 (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family-wise_error_rate">Family-wise error rate</a>) which is much higher than 0.05.  That’s like flipping a coin twice and getting two heads which is not surprising at all.  We should expect such a result even if the null hypothesis is true.  Therefore, there is not a significant result for Tuesday.</p>

<p>I was inspired to write this blog post after watching <a href="https://twitter.com/DrSusanOliver1">Dr. Susan Oliver</a>’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drSAsfuMkuw">Antivaxxers fooled by P-Hacking and apples to oranges comparisons</a>.

<p></p>
<p>I used to tell Craig Burton there was no proof that he could be killed, because he came so close, so many times. But now we have it. Cancer got him, a week ago today. He was sixty-seven.</p>
<p>So here’s a bit of back-story on how Craig and I became great friends.</p>
<p>In late 1987, my ad agency,&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/tag/hodskins-simone-searls/">Hodskins Simone &amp; Searls</a>, pulled together a collection of client companies for the purpose of creating what we called a “connectivity consortium.” The idea was to evangelize universal networking—something the world did not yet have—and to do it together.</p>
<p>The time seemed right. Enterprises everywhere were filling up with personal computers, each doing far more than mainframe terminals ever did. This explosion of personal productivity created a massive demand for&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network">local area networks, aka LANs</a>, on which workers could share files, print documents, and start to put their companies on a digital footing. IBM, Microsoft, and a raft of other companies were big in the LAN space, but one upstart company—<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novell">Novell</a>—was creaming all of them. It did that by embracing PCs, Macs, makers of hardware accessories such as Ethernet cards, plus many different kinds of network wiring and communications protocols.</p>
<p>Our agency was still new in Silicon Valley, and our clients were relatively small. To give our consortium some heft,&nbsp;we needed a leader in the LAN space. So I did the audacious thing, and called on Novell at&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COMDEX">Comdex</a>, which was then the biggest trade show in tech. My target was Judith Clarke, whose marketing smarts were already legendary. For example, while all the biggest companies competed to out-spend each other with giant booths on the show floor, Judith had Novell rent space on the ground floor of the Las Vegas Hilton, turning that space into a sales office for the company, a storefront on the thickest path for foot traffic at the show.</p>
<p>So I cold-called on Judith at that office. Though she was protected from all but potential Novell customers, I cajoled a meeting, and Judith said yes. Novell was in.</p>
<p>The first meeting of our connectivity consortium was in a classroom space at Novell’s Silicon Valley office. One by one, each of my agency’s client companies spoke about what they were bringing to our collective table, while a large unidentified dude sat in the back of the room, leaning forward, looking like a walrus watching fish. After listening patiently to what everyone said, the big dude walked up to the blackboard in front and chalked out diagrams and descriptions of how everything everyone was talking about could actually work together. He also added a piece nobody had brought up yet: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite">TCP/IP, the base protocol for the Internet</a>. That one wasn’t represented by a company, mostly because it wasn’t invented for commercial purposes. But, the big guy said, TCP/IP was the protocol that would, in the long run, make everything work together.</p>
<p>I was of the same mind, so quickly the dude and I got into a deep conversation during which it was clear to me that I was being both well-schooled about networking, yet respected for what little new information I brought to the conversation. After a while, Judith leaned in to tell us that this&nbsp;dude was <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/cherylsnappconner/2013/07/22/analyst-craig-burton-on-prescience-and-innovation/?sh=729f4191fe1b">Craig Burton</a>, and that it was Craig’s strategic vision that was busy guiding Novell to its roaring success.</p>
<p>Right after that meeting, Craig called me just to talk, because he liked how the two of us could play “mind jazz” together, co-thinking about the future of a digital world that was still being born. Which we didn’t stop doing for the next thirty-four years.</p>
<p>So much happened in that time. Craig and Judith† had an affair, got exiled from Novell, married each other and built The Burton Group with another Novell alum, Jamie Lewis. It was through The Burton Group that I met and became good friends with <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2021/12/03/remembering-kim-cameron/">Kim Cameron</a>, who also passed too early, in November of last year. Both were also instrumental in helping start the <a href="http://iiworkshop.org">Internet Identity Workshop</a>, along with too many other things to mention. (<a href="https://flickr.com/photos/docsearls/albums/72157600249338141">Here are photos from the first meeting</a> of what was then the “Identity Gang.”)</p>
<p>If you&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%2B%22Doc+Searls%22+%2B%22Craig+Burton%22">search for Craig’s name and mine together</a>, you’ll find more than a thousand results. I’ll list a few of them later, and unpack their significance. But instead for now, I’ll share what I sent for somebody to use at the service for Craig today in Salt Lake City:</p>
<blockquote><p>In a more just and sensible world, news of Craig Burton’s death would have made the front page of the Deseret News, plus the obituary pages of major papers elsewhere—and a trending topic for days in social media.*</p>
<p>If technology had a Hall of Fame, Craig would belong in it. And maybe some day, that will happen.</p>
<p>Because Craig was one of the most important figures in the history of the networked world where nearly all of us live today. Without Craig’s original ideas, and guiding strategic hand, Novell would not have grown from a small hardware company into the most significant networking company prior to the rise of the Internet itself. Nor would The Burton Group have helped shape the networking business as well, through the dawn of the Internet Age.</p>
<p>In those times and since, Craig’s thinking has often been so deep and far-reaching that I am sure it will be blowing minds for decades to come. Take, for example, what Craig said to me in &nbsp;<a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/giant-zero-part-0x">a 2000 interview</a>&nbsp;for Linux Journal. (Remember that this was when the Internet was still new, and most homes were connected by dial-up modems.)</p>
<p>I see the Net as a world we might see as a bubble. A sphere. It’s growing larger and larger, and yet inside,&nbsp;every point in that sphere is visible to every other one. That’s the architecture of a sphere. Nothing stands&nbsp;between any two points. That’s its virtue: it’s empty in the middle. The distance between any two points is&nbsp;functionally zero, and not just because they can see each other, but because nothing interferes with&nbsp;operation between any two points. There’s a word I like for what’s going on here: terraform. It’s the verb&nbsp;for creating a world. That’s what we’re making here: a new world.</p>
<p>Today, every one of us with a phone in our pocket or purse lives on <a href="https://dsearls.medium.com/the-giant-zero-ce71920a2580">that giant virtual world, with zero functional distance between everyone and everything</a>—a world we have barely started to terraform.</p>
<p>I could say so much more about Craig’s original thinking and his substantial contributions to developments in our world. But I also need to&nbsp;give credit where due to the biggest reason Craig’s heroism remains mostly unsung, and that’s Craig himself. The man was his own worst enemy: a fact he admitted often, and with abiding regret for how his mistakes hurt others, and not just himself.</p>
<p>But I also consider it a matter of answered prayer that, after decades of struggling with alcohol addiction, Craig not only sobered up, but stayed that way, married his high school sweetheart and returned to the faith into which he was born.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now it is up to people like me—Craig’s good friends still in the business—to make sure Craig’s insights and ideas live on.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/sets/72177720300778717">Here is a photo album of Craig</a>. I’ll be adding to it over the coming days.</p>
 
<p>†Judith died a few years ago, at just 66. Her heroism as a marketing genius is also mostly unsung today.</p>

Both are extremely helpful and modern frameworks for understanding, much like Porter’s five forces model was back in the 1980s.&nbsp;</p><br><br><br><br><p>I adopted the same terminology (novel, emergent, good and best) when writing about the development of governance for 2050. In the article <a href="https://opengovernance.net/revising-the-s-curve-in-an-age-of-emergence-6b3a637a66c5">Revising the S-Curve in an age of emergence</a>, I used the S-curve as it has helped us on several previous journeys. It supported our understanding of adoption and growth; it can now be critical in helping us understand the development and evolution of governance towards a sustainable future. An evolutionary S-curve is more applicable than ever as we enter a new phase of emergence. Our actions and behaviours emerge when we grasp that all parts of our ecosystem interact as a more comprehensive whole.</p><p></p><p>A governance S-curve can help us unpack new risks in this dependent ecosystem so that we can make better judgments that lead to better outcomes. What is evident is that we need far more than proof, lineage and provenance of data from a wide ecosystem if we are going to create better judgement environments, we need a new platform.&nbsp;</p><p>The image below takes the same terminology again but moves the Cynefin framework from the four quadrant domains to consider what happens when you have to optimise for more things - as in the <a href="https://peakparadox.com">Peak Paradox</a> model.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><br><p>The yellow outer disc is about optimising for single outcomes and purposes.&nbsp; In so many ways, this is simple as there is only one driving force, incentive or purpose, which means the relationship between cause and effect is obvious.&nbsp;</p><p>The first inner purple ring recognises that some decision-making has a limited number of dependent variables.&nbsp; System thinking is required to unpick, but it is possible to come up with an optimal outcome.</p><p>The pink inner ring is the first level where the relationship between cause and effect requires analysis or some form of investigation and/ or the application of expert knowledge.&nbsp; This is difficult and requires assumptions, often leading to tension and conflict. &nbsp; Optimising is not easy, if at all possible.</p><p>The inner black circle - where peak paradox exists.&nbsp; Complexity thrives as the relationship between cause and effect can only be perceived in hindsight.&nbsp; Models can post-justify outcomes but are unlikely to scale or be repeatable.&nbsp; There is a paradox because the same information can have two (or more) meaning and outcomes.</p><p>The joy of any good framework is that it can always give new understanding and insight. What a Wardley Map then adds is movement, changing of position from where you are to where you will be.&nbsp;</p> Why does this matter? <p>Because what we choose to optimise for is different from what a team of humans or a company will optimise for. Note I use “optimise”, but equality could be “maximise”. These are the yin/yan of effectiveness and efficiency, a continual movement. The purpose ideals are like efficacy - are you doing the right thing?</p><p>What we choose to optimise for is different from what a team of humans or a company will optimise for.</p><p>We know that it is far easier to make a decision when there is clarity of purpose.&nbsp; However, when we have to optimise for different interests that are both dependent and independent - decision-making enters zones that are hard and difficult. It requires judgement.&nbsp; In complexity is where leadership can shine as they can move from simple and obvious decision-making in the outer circle to utilising collective intelligence of the wider team as the decisions become more complex. Asking “what is going on here” and understanding it is outside a single person's reach.&nbsp; High functions and diverse teams are critical for decisions where paradoxes may exist.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>When it gets towards the difficult areas, leadership will first determine if they are being asked to optimise for a policy or to align to an incentive; this shines the first spotlight on a zone where they need to be.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><br><br>

 Last week, I built a small floating subscription button for The 19th. It’s pretty simple, and the design had been floating around since long before I got there:    The button only displays on mobile browsers. There were a few nuances to getting it working in mobile Safari in particular.  My first attempt, where the button’s position was based on browser height percentage, had the button jumping

<p>Last week, I built a small floating subscription button for <a href="https://19thnews.org">The 19th</a>. It’s pretty simple, and the design had been floating around since long before I got there:</p><p><a href="https://19thnews.org/2022/07/cori-bush-proposed-hhs-office-reproductive-health-care/"></a></p><p>The button only displays on mobile browsers. There were a few nuances to getting it working in mobile Safari in particular.</p><p>My first attempt, where the button’s position was based on browser height percentage, had the button jumping around the page when the URL bar appeared and disappeared. Distracting and gross!</p><p>It turns out that Safari alters the height of the page when you refer to it in percentage terms, but doesn’t alter the height of the viewport. So as soon as I specified the height using <code>vh</code> increments, the problem went away.</p><p>Then I was left with a new problem. Although the button was happily static, it was partially obscured by the URL bar (by design) until the bar went away. That’s fine - but it was taking a long time to repaint, so you’d see half a button for a couple of seconds before the browser caught up.</p><p>The solution to this is to apply a CSS transformation that does nothing visible at all:</p> <code>transform: translateZ(0);
</code> <p>The effect of this hack is to tell the browser to use hardware acceleration for this layer. With this in place, it takes no time at all to repaint, and my weird visual glitch was gone.</p><p>The code for the button took less than a day, but as always in web development, there are nuances to look out for. (I won’t get into tracking Google Analytics event clicks on a fully SVG button, which is also harder than it should be.)</p><p>The result should be more mobile clickthroughs <a href="https://19thnews.org/newsletters/daily/">to subscribe to the daily newsletter</a>, giving more people the opportunity to connect to our community. It’s the kind of small feature that can have an outsize impact - and, hopefully, make the audience team happy. Which, in turn, makes me happy too.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>By the way, we’re hiring! <a href="https://19thnews.org/19th-news-web-applications-engineer-job-posting/">Our web applications engineer position is open for applications.</a></p>

 high-quality information flows

 no censorship (content, finance etc)

 crypto-verified information correctness 
 privacy

 composability 
 collaboration

<p>Some of this is clearly aspirational, perhaps on the other side of likely.
Also not exactly what I would say if asked. But nevertheless an interesting list.</p>

   Sqitch tutorial for SQLite 
 Sqitch is an interesting implementation of database migrations: it's a command-line tool written in Perl with an interface similar to Git, providing commands to create, run, revert and track migration scripts. The scripts the selves are written as SQL in whichever database engine you are using. The tutorial for SQLite gives a good idea as to how the whole system works.

   Promise Maps 
 Egbert Teeselink describes a neat JavaScript caching pattern: instead of caching key:value cache key:promise-that-resolves-to-value - doing this gives you dog piling prevention for free,  because the first lookup of a value trigers the computation to fetch it while subsequent lookups wait on the same promise to resolve - or resolve instantly if the computation has completed.

  <p>A flurry of releases this week, including a new Datasette alpha and a fixed Datasette Desktop.</p>
 datasette 0.62a1 
<p>Work on Datasette Cloud continues - the last 10% of the work needed for the beta launch is trending towards taking 90% of the time. It's been driving all sorts of fixes to the wider Datasette ecosystem, which is nice.</p>
<p>I ran into a bug which would have been easier to investigate using <a href="https://sentry.io/">Sentry</a>. The <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-sentry">datasette-sentry</a> plugin wasn't working right, and it turned out I <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1770">needed a new handle_exception() plugin hook</a> to fix it. This was the impetus I needed to push out <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/releases/tag/0.62a1">a new Datasette alpha</a> - I like to get new hooks into an alpha as quickly as possible so I can depend on that Datasette version from alpha releases of plugins.</p>
<p>Here are some other highlights from the alpha's release notes:</p>
<blockquote>
 
 The <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/plugin_hooks.html#plugin-hook-render-cell">render_cell()</a> plugin hook is now also passed a <code>row</code> argument, representing the <code>sqlite3.Row</code> object that is being rendered. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1300">#1300</a>) 
 
</blockquote>
<p>A neat thing about <a href="https://pluggy.readthedocs.io/">Pluggy</a> is that you can add new arguments to existing plugin hooks without breaking plugins that already use them.</p>
<blockquote>
 
 New <code>--nolock</code> option for ignoring file locks when opening read-only databases. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1744">#1744</a>) 
 
</blockquote>
<p>Since the very start of the project Datasette has suggested trying the following command to start exploring your Google Chrome history, which is stored using SQLite:</p>
 <code>datasette ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/Default/History
</code> 
<p>I'm not sure when this changed, but I tried running the command recently and got the following error:</p>
 <code>sqlite3.OperationalError: database is locked
</code> 
<p>Since Datasette opens databases in read-only mode I didn't see why a lock like this should be respected. It turns out SQLite can be told to ignore locks like so:</p>
 sqlite3.connect(
    "file:places.sqlite?mode=ro&amp;nolock=1",
    uri=True
) 
<p>So I added a <code>--nolock</code> option to Datasette which does exactly that:</p>
 <code>datasette ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/Default/History --nolock
</code> 
<blockquote>
 
 Datasette now has a <a href="https://discord.gg/ktd74dm5mw">Discord community</a>. 
 
</blockquote>
<p>Inspired by <a href="https://dev.to/fredkschott/5-more-things-i-learned-building-snowpack-to-20-000-stars-5dc9">6 More Things I Learned Building Snowpack to 20,000 Stars (Part 2)</a> by Fred K. Schott I finally setup a chat community for Datasette, using <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a>.</p>
<p>It's attracted 88 members already! You can <a href="https://discord.gg/ktd74dm5mw">join it here</a>. I wrote detailed notes on how I configured it in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette.io/issues/112">this issue</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
 
 Database file downloads now implement conditional GET using ETags. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1739">#1739</a>) 
 
</blockquote>
<p>This is a change I made to support <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/May/4/datasette-lite/">Datasette Lite</a> - I noticed that the WASM version of Datasette was downloading a fresh database every time, so I added <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/ETag#caching_of_unchanged_resources">ETag support</a> to encourage browsers to avoid a duplicate download and use a cached copy of the database file instead, provided it hasn't changed.</p>
 Datasette Desktop 
<p><a href="https://datasette.io/desktop">Datasette Desktop</a> was hanging on launch. Paul Everitt <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app/issues/139">figured out a fix</a>, which it took me way too long to get around to applying.</p>
<p>I finally shipped that in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app/releases/tag/0.2.2">Datasette Desktop 0.2.2</a>, but I wanted to reduce the chances of this happening again as much as possible. Datasette Desktop's Elecron tests used the <a href="https://github.com/electron-userland/spectron">spectron</a> test harness, but that's marked as deprecated.</p>
<p>I'm a big <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/playwright/">fan of Playwright</a> and I was optimistic to see that it has support for testing Electron apps. I figured out how to use that with Datasette Desktop and run the tests in GitHub Actions: I wrote up what I learned in a TIL, <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/electron/testing-electron-playwright">Testing Electron apps with Playwright and GitHub Actions</a>.</p>
 sqlite-utils 3.28 
<p>Annotated <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v3-28">release notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
 
 New <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/python-api.html#python-api-duplicate">table.duplicate(new_name)</a> method for creating a copy of a table with a matching schema and row contents. Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/davidleejy">David</a>. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils/issues/449">#449</a>) 
 New <code>sqlite-utils duplicate data.db table_name new_name</code> CLI command for <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/cli.html#cli-duplicate-table">Duplicating tables</a>. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils/issues/454">#454</a>) 
 
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/davidleejy">davidleejy</a> suggested the <code>table.duplicate()</code> method and contributed an implementation. This was the impetus for pushing out a fresh release.</p>
<p>I added the CLI equivalent, <code>sqlite-utils duplicate</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
 
 
<code>sqlite_utils.utils.rows_from_file()</code> is now a <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/reference.html#reference-utils-rows-from-file">documented API</a>. It can be used to read a sequence of dictionaries from a file-like object containing CSV, TSV, JSON or newline-delimited JSON. It can be passed an explicit format or can attempt to detect the format automatically. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils/issues/443">#443</a>) 
 
<code>sqlite_utils.utils.TypeTracker</code> is now a documented API for detecting the likely column types for a sequence of string rows, see <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/python-api.html#python-api-typetracker">Detecting column types using TypeTracker</a>. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils/issues/445">#445</a>) 
 
<code>sqlite_utils.utils.chunks()</code> is now a documented API for <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/reference.html#reference-utils-chunks">splitting an iterator into chunks</a>. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils/issues/451">#451</a>) 
 
</blockquote>
<p>I have a policy that any time I need to use an undocumented method from <code>sqlite-utils</code> in some other project I file an issue to add that to the documented API surface.</p>
<p>I had used <code>rows_from_file()</code> and <code>TypeTracker</code> in <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-socrata">datasette-socrata</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
 
 
<code>sqlite-utils enable-fts</code> now has a <code>--replace</code> option for replacing the existing FTS configuration for a table. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils/issues/450">#450</a>) 
 The <code>create-index</code>, <code>add-column</code> and <code>duplicate</code> commands all now take a <code>--ignore</code> option for ignoring errors should the database not be in the right state for them to operate. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils/issues/450">#450</a>) 
 
</blockquote>
<p>This was inspired by my TIL <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/bash/ignore-errors">Ignoring errors in a section of a Bash script</a> - a trick I had to figure out because one of my scripts needed to add columns and enable FTS but only if those changes had not been previously applied.</p>

<p>Content warning: discussion of body dysmorphia, weight loss.</p><p>I stopped testing positive for covid a while ago, but I’ve still been feeling very low-energy. I measure my activity on my Apple Watch - yes, I’m that person - and I haven’t managed to close my activity rings for weeks. Correspondingly, I’m pretty sure I’ve been gaining weight. </p><p>I’ve never felt very comfortable with my body: I’ve been much bigger than most of the people around me for most of my life. I’m 6’4” tall and, unlike many tall people, look like I’ve been proportionally enlarged in Photoshop. Over the last few years, thanks in no small part to the trauma surrounding caring for my mother and her subsequent loss, as well as the unfortunate effects of aging, those proportions have been softening.</p><p>I wish I could be smaller. Getting fitter and losing weight is at least somewhat within my control, but the overall proportions of my body - that height, the bigness of me - is something I have to live with. I don’t enjoy it. When I was much younger, I wanted to hurt myself over it. Now it’s more of a background discomfort, which sometimes comes into the foreground when I have to go shopping for clothes or catch myself in a full-length mirror. I move awkwardly and look awkward.</p><p>Should I be more comfortable in my own skin now that I’m rapidly approaching my mid-forties? Probably. It’s not a place I’ve ever managed to get to. It particularly doesn’t feel great after a long period of illness-related inactivity, but I’m digging deep to try and get over my discomfort and concentrate on the bits that relate to my health.</p><p>Covid really sucks; I hope to never get it again. I’m still wearing an N95 mask indoors, and I hope you are too. I’ve checked in with a few friends who are also recovering from it, and most of them are also still in this low-energy phase. Our brains aren’t completely back up and running, but we’re grateful to at least be breathing easily. I certainly feel that it pushed me off-track in a way that I’ll be feeling for months.</p>

<p>Let’s start with what happened to TV.</p>
<p>For decades, all TV signals were “over the air,” and free to be watched by anyone with a TV and an antenna. Then these things happened:</p>
 
 &nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television">Community Antenna TeleVision, aka CATV</a>, gave us most or all of our free over-the-air channels, plus many more—for a monthly subscription fee. They delivered this service, literally, through a cable connection—one that looked like the old one that went to an outside antenna, but instead went back to the cable company’s local headquarters. 
 Then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay_television">premium TV</a> (aka “pay,” “prestige” and “subscription” TV), along with one’s cable channel selection. This started with&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO">HBO</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showtime_(TV_network)">Showtime</a>. It cost additional subscription fees but was inside your cable channel selection and your monthly cable bill. 
 Then came&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media">streaming services</a>, (aka <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_on_demand">Video on Demand, or VoD</a>) showed up over the Internet, and then through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_media_player">media players</a>&nbsp;you could hook up to your tv through an input (usually HDMI) aside from the one from your cable box, and your cable service—even if your Internet service was provided by the cable company. This is why the cable industry called all of these services&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-top_media_service">“over the top,” or OTT</a>. The main brands here were Amazon Fire, Apple TV, Google Chromecast, and Roku. Being delivered over the Internet rather than lumped in with all those cable channels, higher resolutions were possible. At best most cable services are “HD,” which was fine a decade ago, but is now quite retro. Want to watch TV in 4K, HDR, and all that? Subscribe through your smart OTT media intermediary. 
 And now media players are baked into TVs. Go to Best Buy, Costco, Sam’s Club, Amazon, or Walmart, and you’ll see promos for “smart” Google, Fire (Amazon), Roku, webOS, and Tizen TVs—rather than just Sony, LG, Samsung, and other brands. Relatively cheap brands, such as Vizio, TCL, and Hisense, are essentially branded media players with secondary brand names on the bezel. 
 
<p>Economically speaking, all that built-in smartness is about two things. One is facilitating subscriptions, and the other is <a href="https://moniotrlab.ccis.neu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ren-imc19.pdf">spying on you</a>&nbsp;for the advertising business. But let’s table the latter and focus just on subscriptions, because that’s the way the service world is going.</p>
<p>More and more formerly free stuff on the Net is available only behind paywalls. Newspapers and magazines have been playing this game for some time. But, now that <a href="https://reality2.substack.com/p/is-substack-the-new-blogging">Substack is the new blogging</a>, many writers there are paywalling their stuff as well. Remember SlideShare? Now it’s “Read free for 60 days.”</p>
<p>Podcasting is drifting in that direction too. SiriusXM and Spotify together paid over a half $billion to put a large mess of popular podcasts into subscription-based complete (SiriusXM) or partial (Spotify) paywall systems, pushing podcasting toward the place where premium TV has already sat for years—even though lots of popular podcasts are still paid for by advertising.</p>
<p>I could add a lot of data here, but I’m about to leave on a road trip. So I’ll leave it up to you. Look at what you’re spending now on subscriptions, and how that collection of expenses is going up. Also, take a look at how much of what was free on the Net and the Web is moving to a paid subscription model. The trend is not small, and I don’t see it stopping soon.</p>

<a href="https://ludopoitou.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/directoryservices.png"></a> 


<p><a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/downloads/browse/ds/featured">ForgeRock Directory Services 7.2</a> was and will be the last release of ForgeRock products that I’ve managed. It was finished when I left the company and was released to the public a few days after. Before I dive into the changes available in this release, I’d like to thank the amazing team that produced this version, from the whole Engineering team led by Matt Swift, to the Quality engineering led by Carole Forel, the best and only technical writer Mark Craig, and also our sustaining engineer Chris Ridd who contributed some important fixes to existing customers. You all rock and I’ve really appreciated working with you all these years.</p>



<p>So what’s new and exciting in DS 7.2?</p>



<p>First, this version introduces a new type of index: <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ds/7.2/config-guide/indexing.html#big-indexes">Big Index</a>. This type of index is to be used to optimize search queries that are expecting to return a large number of results among an even much larger number of entries. For example, if you have an application that searches for all users in the USA that live in a specific state.  In a population of hundreds of millions users, you may have millions that live in one particular state (let’s say Ohio). With previous versions, searching for all users in Ohio would be unindexed and the search if allowed would scan the whole directory data to identify the ones in Ohio. With 7.2, the state attribute can be indexed as a Big Index, and the same search query would be considered as indexed, only going through the reduced set of users with that have Ohio as the value for the state attribute.</p>



<p>Big Indexes can have a lesser impact on write performances than regular indexes, but they tend to have a higher on disk footprint. As usual, choosing to use a Big Index type is a matter of trade-of between read and write performances, but also disk space occupation which may also have some impact on performances. It is recommended to test and run benchmarks in development or pre-production environments before using them in production.</p>


 
 


<p>The second significant new feature in 7.2 is the support of the <a href="https://www.haproxy.org/download/1.8/doc/proxy-protocol.txt">HAProxy Protocol</a> for LDAP and LDAPS. When ForgeRock Directory Services is deployed behind a software load-balancer such as HAProxy, NGINX or Kubernetes Ingress, it’s not possible for DS to know the IP address of the Client application (the only IP address known is the one of the load-balancer), therefore, it is not possible to enforce specific access controls or limits based on the applications. By supporting the HAProxy Protocol, DS can decode a specific header sent by the load-balancer and retrieve some information about the client application such as IP address but also some TLS related information if the connection between the client and the load-balancer is secured by TLS, and DS can use this information in access controls, logging, limits… You can find more details about DS support of the <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ds/7.2/config-guide/proxy-protocol.html">Proxy Protocol in DS documentation</a>.</p>



<p>In DS 7.2, we have added a new option for securing and hashing passwords: <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc9106">Argon2</a>. When enabled (which is the default), this allows importing users with Argon2 hashed passwords, and letting them authenticating immediately. Argon2 may be selected as well as the default scheme for hashing new passwords, by associating it with a password policy (such as the default password policy). The Argon2 <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ds/7.2/security-guide/passwords.html#pwd-storage-settings">password scheme has several parameters</a> that control the cost of the hash: version, number of iterations, amount of memory to use and parallelism (aka number of threads used). While Argon2 is probably today the best algorithm to secure passwords, it can have a very big impact on the server’s performance, depending on the Argon2 parameters selected. Remember that DS encrypts the entries on disk by default, and therefore the risk of exposing hashed passwords at rest is extremely low (if not null). </p>



<p>Also new is the ability to search for attributes with a DistinguishedName syntax <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ds/7.2/ldap-guide/search-ldap.html#dn-pattern-matching">using pattern matching</a>. DS 7.2 introduces a new matching rule named distinguishedNamePatternMatch (defined with the OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.36733.2.1.4.13). It can be used to search for users with a specific manager for example with the following filter “(manager:1.3.6.1.4.1.36733.2.1.4.13:=uid=trigden,**)” or a more human readable form “(manager:distinguishedNamePatternMatch:=uid=trigden,**)”, or to search for users whose manager is part of the Admins organisational unit with the following filter “(manager:1.3.6.1.4.1.36733.2.1.4.13:=*,ou=Admins,dc=example,dc=com)”.</p>



<p>ForgeRock Directory Services 7.2 includes several minor improvements:</p>



  Monitoring has been improved to include metrics about <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ds/7.2/config-guide/indexing.html#unused-indexes">index use in searches</a>, and access logs now contain information about the proc entry’s size (the later is also written in the access logs).   The <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ds/7.2/config-guide/indexing.html#debug-search">index troubleshooting attribute “DebugSearchIndex”</a> output has been revised to provide better details for the query plan.   Alert notifications are raised when backups are finished.  The <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ds/7.2/release-notes/whats-new.html#rest_to_ldap">REST2LDAP service provides several enhancements</a> making several queries easier.  



<p>As with every release, there has been several performances optimizations and improvements, many minor issues corrected.</p>



<p>You can find the full details of the changes in the <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ds/7.2/release-notes/preface.html">Release Notes</a>.</p>

<p>Jake Archibald's 13 minute Google I/O talk demonstrating the page transitions API that's now available in Chrome Canary. This is a fascinating piece of API design - it works by effectively creating a static image screenshot of the before and after states of the transition, then letting you define CSS animations that animate a transition between the two static images. By default the screenshot encompasses the full viewport, but you can instead define multiple elements within the page and apply separate transitions to them. It's only available for SPAs right now but the final design should include support for multi-page applications as well - which means transitions with no JavaScript needed at all!</p>

  <p>Summary:      I was recently asked to respond in writing to the prompt "What is the most inventive or innovative thing you've done?" I decided to write about picos.</p>



<p>
    In 2007, I co-founded a company called <a href="https://www.kynetx.com/">Kynetx</a> and realized that the infrastructure necessary for building our product did not exist. To address that gap, I invented picos, an internet-first, persistent, actor-model programming system. <a href="https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/overview">Picos</a> are the most inventive thing I've done. Being internet-first, every pico is serverless and cloud-native, presenting an API that can be fully customized by developers. Because they're persistent, picos support databaseless programming with intuitive data isolation. As an actor-model programming system, different picos can operate concurrently without the need for locks, making them a natural choice for easily building decentralized systems.
</p>

<p>
    Picos can be arranged in networks supporting peer-to-peer communication and computation. A cooperating network of picos reacts to messages, changes state, and sends messages. Picos have an internal event bus for distributing those messages to rules installed in the pico. Rules in the pico are selected to run based on declarative event expressions. The pico matches events on its bus with event scenarios declared in each rule's event expression. The pico engine schedules any rule whose event expression matches the event for execution. Executing rules may raise additional events which are processed in the same way.
</p>

<p>
    As Kynetx reacted to market forces and trends, like the rise of mobile, the product line changed, and picos evolved and matured to match those changing needs, becoming a system that was capable of supporting complex Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. For example, we ran a successful Kickstarter campaign in 2013 to build a connected car product called Fuse. Fuse used a cellular sensor connected to the vehicle's on-board diagnostics port (OBD2) to raise events from the car's internal bus to a pico that served as the vehicle's digital twin. Picos allowed Fuse to easily provide an autonomous processing agent for each vehicle and to organize those into fleets. Because picos support peer-to-peer architectures, putting a vehicle in more than one fleet or having a fleet with multiple owners was easy.
</p>

<p>
    Fuse presented a conventional IoT user experience using a mobile app connected to a cloud service built using picos. But thanks to the inherently distributed nature of picos, Fuse offered owner choice and service substitutability. Owners could choose to move the picos representing their fleet to an alternate service provider, or even self-host if they desired without loss of functionality. Operationally, picos proved more than capable of providing responsive, scalable, and resilient service for Fuse customers without significant effort on my part. Fuse ultimately shut down because the operator of the network supplying the OBD2 devices went out of business. But while Fuse ran, picos provided Fuse customers with an efficient, capable, and resilient infrastructure for a valuable IoT service with unique characteristics.
</p>

<p>
    The characteristics of picos make them a good choice for building distributed and decentralized applications that are responsive, resilient to failure, and respond well to uneven workloads. Asynchronous messaging and concurrent operation make picos a great fit for modern distributed applications. For example, picos can synchronously query other picos to get data snapshots, but this is not usually the most efficient interaction pattern. Instead, because picos support lock-free asynchronous concurrency, a system of picos can efficiently respond to events to accomplish a task using reactive programming patterns like scatter-gather.
</p>

<p>
    The development of picos has continued, with the underlying pico engine having gone through three major versions. The <a href="https://github.com/Picolab/pico-engine">current version is based on NodeJS and is open-source</a>. The latest version was designed to operate on small platforms like a Raspberry PI as well as cloud platforms like Amazon's EC2. Over the years hundreds of developers have used picos for their programming projects. Recent applications include a proof-of-concept system supporting intention-based ecommerce by Customer Commons.
</p>

<p>
    The architecture of picos was a good fit for Customer Commons' objective to build a system promoting user autonomy and choice because picos provide better control over apps and data. This is a natural result of the pico model where each pico represents a closure over services and data. Picos cleanly separate the data for different entities. Picos, representing a specific entity, and rulesets representing a specific business capability within the pico, provide fine grained control over data and its processing. For example, if you sell a car represented in Fuse, you can transfer the vehicle pico to the new owner, after deleting the Trips application, and its associated data, while leaving untouched the maintenance records, which are isolated inside the Maintenance application in the pico.
</p>

<p>
    I didn't start out in 2007 to write a programming language that naturally supports decentralized programming using the actor-model while being cloud-native, serverless, and databaseless. Indeed, if I had, I likely wouldn't have succeeded. Instead picos evolved from a simple rule language for modifying web pages to a powerful, general-purpose programming system for building any decentralized application. Picos are easily the most important technology I've invented.

   I built a new tool this week: sqlite-comprehend, which passes text from a SQLite database through the AWS Comprehend entity extraction service and stores the returned entities. 
 I created this as a complement to my s3-ocr tool, which uses AWS Textract service to perform OCR against every PDF file in an S3 bucket.

  <p>I built a new tool this week: <a href="https://datasette.io/tools/sqlite-comprehend">sqlite-comprehend</a>, which passes text from a SQLite database through the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend/">AWS Comprehend</a> entity extraction service and stores the returned entities.</p>
<p>I created this as a complement to my <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Jun/30/s3-ocr/">s3-ocr tool</a>, which uses <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/textract/">AWS Textract</a> service to perform OCR against every PDF file in an S3 bucket.</p>
<p>Short version: given a database table full of text, run the following:</p>
 <code>% pip install sqlite-comprehend
% sqlite-comprehend entities myblog.db blog_entry body --strip-tags
  [###---------------------------------]    9%  00:01:02
</code> 
<p>This will churn through every piece of text in the <code>body</code> column of the <code>blog_entry</code> table in the <code>myblog.db</code> SQLite database, strip any HTML tags (the <code>--strip-tags</code> option), submit it to AWS Comprehend, and store the extracted entities in the following tables:</p>
 
 
<a href="https://datasette.simonwillison.net/simonwillisonblog/comprehend_entities">comprehend_entities</a> - the extracted entities, classified by type 
 
<a href="https://datasette.simonwillison.net/simonwillisonblog/blog_entry_comprehend_entities">blog_entry_comprehend_entities</a> - a table relating entities to the entries that they appear in 
 
<a href="https://datasette.simonwillison.net/simonwillisonblog/comprehend_entity_types">comprehend_entity_types</a> - a small lookup table of entity types 
 
<p>The above table names link to a live demo produced by running the tool against all of the content in my blog.</p>
<p>Here are <a href="https://datasette.simonwillison.net/simonwillisonblog/blog_entry_comprehend_entities?entity=47&amp;_sort_desc=rowid">225 mentions</a> that Comprehend classified as the organization called "Mozilla".</p>
<p>The tool tracks which rows have been processed already (in the <a href="https://datasette.simonwillison.net/simonwillisonblog/blog_entry_comprehend_entities_done">blog_entry_comprehend_entities_done</a> table), so you can run it multiple times and it will only process newly added rows.</p>
<p>AWS Comprehend <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend/pricing/">pricing</a> starts at $0.0001 per hundred characters. <code>sqlite-comprehend</code> only submits the first 5,000 characters of each row.</p>
 How the demo works 
<p>My live demo for this tool uses a new <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a> instance at <a href="https://datasette.simonwillison.net/">datasette.simonwillison.net</a>. It hosts a complete copy of the data from my blog - data that lives in a Django/PostgreSQL database on Heroku, but is now mirrored to a SQLite database hosted by Datasette.</p>
<p>The demo runs out of my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog-backup">simonwillisonblog-backup</a> GitHub repository.</p>
<p>A couple of years ago I realized that I'm no longer happy having any content I care about not stored in a Git repository. I want to track my changes! I also want really robust backups: GitHub mirror their repos to three different regions around the world, and having data in a Git repository makes mirroring it somewhere else as easy as running a <code>git pull</code>.</p>
<p>So I created <code>simonwillisonblog-backup</code> using a couple of my other tools: <a href="https://datasette.io/tools/db-to-sqlite">db-to-sqlite</a>, which converts a PostgreSQL database to a SQLite database, and <a href="https://datasette.io/tools/sqlite-diffable">sqlite-diffable</a>, which dumps out a SQLite database as a "diffable" directory of newline-delimited JSON files.</p>
<p>Here's the simplest version of that pattern:</p>
  db-to-sqlite \
    'postgresql+psycopg2://user:pass@hostname:5432/dbname' \
    simonwillisonblog.db --all  
<p>This connects to PostgreSQL, loops through all of the database tables and converts them all to SQLite tables stored in <code>simonwillisonblog.db</code>.</p>
  sqlite-diffable dump simonwillisonblog.db simonwillisonblog --all  
<p>This converts that SQLite database into a directory of JSON files. Each table gets two files: <code>table.metadata.json</code> containing the table's name, columns and schema and <code>table.ndjson</code> containing a newline-separated list of JSON arrays representing every row in that table.</p>
<p>You can see these files for my blog's database in the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog-backup/tree/main/simonwillisonblog">simonwillisonblog</a> folder.</p>
<p>(My actual script is <a href="https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog-backup/blob/30fc957b5b6711c9a9cd3e427b709f59fd5b9c56/.github/workflows/backup.yml#L36-L67">a little more complex</a>, because I backup only selected tables and then run extra code to redact some of the fields.)</p>
<p>Since I set this up it's captured <a href="https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog-backup/commits/main">over 600 changes</a> I've applied to my blog's database, all made the regular Django admin interface.</p>
<p>This morning I <a href="https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog-backup/compare/bab595ae7cb0802b9dbc12ef29864bee75081be5...30fc957b5b6711c9a9cd3e427b709f59fd5b9c56#diff-5876767d72a925ae5674ea64687a681f6a5a935fea020c62d168c7a172ccd2c6">extended the script</a> to run <code>sqlite-comprehend</code> against my blog entries and deploy the resulting data using Datasette.</p>
<p>The concise version of the new script looks like this:</p>
 <code>wget -q https://datasette.simonwillison.net/simonwillisonblog.db
</code> 
<p>This retrieves the previous version of the database. I do this to avoid being charged by AWS Comprehend for running entity extraction against rows I have already processed.</p>
 <code>sqlite-diffable load simonwillisonblog.db simonwillisonblog --replace
</code> 
<p>This creates the <code>simonwillisonblog.db</code> database by loading in the JSON from the <code>simonwillisonblog/</code> folder. I do it this way mainly to exercise the new <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-diffable/issues/3">sqlite-diffable load</a> command I just added to that tool.</p>
<p>The <code>--replace</code> option ensures that any tables that already exist are replaced by a fresh copy (while leaving my existing comprehend entity extraction data intact).</p>
 <code>sqlite-comprehend entities simonwillisonblog.db blog_entry title body --strip-tags
</code> 
<p>This runs <code>sqlite-comprehend</code> against the blog entries that have not yet been processed.</p>
 <code>set +e
sqlite-utils enable-fts simonwillisonblog.db blog_series title summary --create-triggers --tokenize porter 2&gt;/dev/null
sqlite-utils enable-fts simonwillisonblog.db blog_tag tag --create-triggers --tokenize porter 2&gt;/dev/null
sqlite-utils enable-fts simonwillisonblog.db blog_quotation quotation source --create-triggers --tokenize porter 2&gt;/dev/null
sqlite-utils enable-fts simonwillisonblog.db blog_entry title body --create-triggers --tokenize porter 2&gt;/dev/null
sqlite-utils enable-fts simonwillisonblog.db blog_blogmark link_title via_title commentary --create-triggers --tokenize porter 2&gt;/dev/null
set -e
</code> 
<p>This configures SQLite full-text search against each of those tables, using <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/bash/ignore-errors">this pattern</a> to supress any errors that occur if the FTS tables already exist.</p>
<p>Setting up FTS in this way means I can use the <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-search-all">datasette-search-all plugin</a> to run searches like <a href="https://datasette.simonwillison.net/-/search?q=s3">this one for aws</a> across all of those tables at once.</p>
 <code>datasette publish cloudrun simonwillisonblog.db \
-m metadata.yml \
--service simonwillisonblog \
--install datasette-block-robots \
--install datasette-graphql \
--install datasette-search-all
</code>

<p>This post shows how to invite new Azure AD external guest users and assign the users to Azure AD groups using an ASP.NET Core APP Connector to import or update existing users from an external IAM and synchronize the users in Azure AD. The authorization can be implemented using Azure AD groups and can be imported or used in the ASP.NET Core API. </p>



<p>Setup</p>



<p>The APP Connector or the IAM connector is implemented using ASP.NET Core and Microsoft Graph. Two Azure APP registrations are used, one the for the external application and a second for the Microsoft Graph access. Both applications use an application client and can be run as background services, console applications or whatever. Only the APP Connector has access to the Microsoft Graph API and the graph application permissions are allowed only for this client. This way, the Microsoft Graph client can be controlled as a lot of privileges are required to add, update and delete users or add and remove group assignments. We only allow the client explicit imports or updates for guest users. The APP Connector sends invites to the new external guest users and the users can then authentication using an email code. The correct groups are then assigned to the user depending on the API payload. With this, it is possible to keep external user accounting and manage the external identities in AAD without having to migrate the users. One unsolved problem with this solution is single sign on (SSO). It would be possible to achieve this, if all the external users came from the same domain and the external IAM system supported SAML. AAD does not support OpenID Connect for this.</p>







<p>Microsoft Graph client</p>



<p>A confidential client is used to get an application access token for the Microsoft Graph API calls. The .default scope is used to request the access token using the OAuth client credentials flow. The Azure SDK ClientSecretCredential is used to authorize the client.</p>


  public MsGraphService(IConfiguration configuration,
	IOptions&lt;GroupsConfiguration&gt; groups,
	ILogger&lt;MsGraphService&gt; logger)
{
	_groups = groups.Value;
	_logger = logger;
	string[]? scopes = configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;
		("AadGraph:Scopes")?.Split(' ');
		
	var tenantId = configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;
		("AadGraph:TenantId");

	// Values from app registration
	var clientId = configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;
		("AadGraph:ClientId");
		
	var clientSecret = configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;
		("AadGraph:ClientSecret");

	_federatedDomainDomain = configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;
		("FederatedDomain");

	var options = new TokenCredentialOptions
	{
		AuthorityHost = AzureAuthorityHosts.AzurePublicCloud
	};

// https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.identity.clientsecretcredential
	var clientSecretCredential = new ClientSecretCredential(
		tenantId, clientId, clientSecret, options);

	_graphServiceClient = new GraphServiceClient(
		clientSecretCredential, scopes);
}
  


<p>The following permissions were added to the Azure App registration for the Graph requests. See the Microsoft Graph documentation to see what permissions are required for what API request. All permissions are application permissions as an application access token was requested. No user is involved. </p>



  Directory.Read.All  Directory.ReadWrite.All  Group.Read.All  Group.ReadWrite.All  // if role assignments are used in the Azure AD group<br>RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory  User.Read.All  User.ReadWrite.All  



<p></p>



<p>ASP.NET Core application client</p>



<p>The external identity system also uses the client credentials to access the APP Connector API, this time using an access token from the second Azure App registration. This is separated from the Azure App registration used for the Microsoft Graph requests. The scopes is defined to use the “.default” value which requires no consent.</p>


  // 1. Client client credentials client
var app = ConfidentialClientApplicationBuilder
    .Create(configuration["AzureAd:ClientId"])
    .WithClientSecret(configuration["AzureAd:ClientSecret"])
    .WithAuthority(configuration["AzureAd:Authority"])
    .Build();

var scopes = new[] { configuration["AzureAd:Scope"] };

// 2. Get access token
var authResult = await app.AcquireTokenForClient(scopes)   
    .ExecuteAsync();
  


<p></p>



<p>Implement the user invite</p>



<p>I decided to invite the users from the external identity providers in the Azure AD as guest users. At present, the default authentication sends a code to the user email which can be used to sign-in. You could create new AAD users, or even a federated AAD user. Single sign on will only work for google, facebook or a SAML domain federation where users come from the same domain. I wish for an OpenID Connect external authentication button in my sign-in UI where I can decide which users and from what domain authenticate in my AAD. This is where AAD is really lagging behind other identity providers. </p>


  /// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Graph invitations only works for Azure AD, not Azure B2C
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
public async Task&lt;Invitation?&gt; InviteUser(UserModel userModel, string redirectUrl)
{
	var invitation = new Invitation
	{
		InvitedUserEmailAddress = userModel.Email,
		InvitedUser = new User
		{
			GivenName = userModel.FirstName,
			Surname = userModel.LastName,
			DisplayName = $"{userModel.FirstName} {userModel.LastName}",
			Mail = userModel.Email,
			UserType = "Guest", // Member
			OtherMails = new List&lt;string&gt; { userModel.Email },
			Identities = new List&lt;ObjectIdentity&gt;
			{
				new ObjectIdentity
				{
					SignInType = "federated",
					Issuer = _federatedDomainDomain,
					IssuerAssignedId = userModel.Email
				},
			},
			PasswordPolicies = "DisablePasswordExpiration"
		},
		SendInvitationMessage = true,
		InviteRedirectUrl = redirectUrl,
		InvitedUserType = "guest" // default is guest,member
	};

	var invite = await _graphServiceClient.Invitations
		.Request()
		.AddAsync(invitation);

	return invite;
}

<p>Adding, Removing AAD users and groups</p>



<p>Once the users exist in the AAD tenant, you can assign the users to groups, remove assignments, remove users or update users. If a user is disabled in the external IAM system, you cannot disable the user in the AAD with an application permission, you can only delete the user. You can assign security groups or M365  groups to the AAD guest user. With this, the AAD IT admin can manage guest users and assign the group of guests to any AAD application.</p>

<p>Create a new guest user with group assignments</p>



<p>I created a service which then creates a user and assigns the defined groups to the user using the Graph services defined above. You cannot select users or groups after creating them for n-seconds. It is important to use the request result from the create requests, otherwise you will have to implement the follow up tasks in a worker process or poll the graph API until the get returns the updated user or group.</p>


  public async Task&lt;(UserModel? UserModel, string Error)&gt; 
	CreateUserAsync(UserModel userModel)
{
	var emailValid = _msGraphService.IsEmailValid(userModel.Email);
	if (!emailValid)
	{
		return (null, "Email is not valid");
	}

	var user = await _msGraphService.UserExistsAsync(userModel.Email);
	if (user != null)
	{
		return (null, "User with this email already exists in AAD tenant");
	}

	var result = await _msGraphService.InviteUser(userModel,
						_configuration["InviteUserRedirctUrl"]);

	if (result != null)
	{
		await AssignmentGroupsAsync(
			result.InvitedUser.Id, 
			userModel.AccessRolesPermissions, 
			new List&lt;string&gt;());
	}

	return (userModel, string.Empty);
}
  


<p>The UpdateAssignmentGroupsAsync and the AssignmentGroupsAsync maps the API definition to the configured Azure AD group and removes or adds the group as defined. </p>


  private async Task UpdateAssignmentGroupsAsync(string userId, List&lt;string&gt;? accessRolesPermissions)
{
	var currentGroupIds = await _msGraphService.GetGraphUserMemberGroups(userId);
	var currentGroupIdsList = currentGroupIds.ToList();
	await AssignmentGroupsAsync(userId, accessRolesPermissions, currentGroupIdsList);
}

private async Task AssignmentGroupsAsync(string userId,
	List&lt;string&gt;? accessRolesPermissions, List&lt;string&gt; currentGroupIds)
{
	await _msGraphService.AddRemoveGroupMembership(userId, 
		accessRolesPermissions, currentGroupIds, _groups.UserWorkspace, Consts.USER_WORKSPACE);
	await _msGraphService.AddRemoveGroupMembership(userId, 
		accessRolesPermissions, currentGroupIds, _groups.AdminWorkshop, Consts.ADMIN_WORKSPACE);
}
  


<p>The service method can then be made public in a Web API which requires the AAD application access token. This access token will only work for the API. The graph API access token is never made public. The Graph API access token has a lot of permissions.</p>


  [HttpPost("Create")]
[ProducesResponseType(StatusCodes.Status201Created, 
	Type = typeof(UserModel))]
[ProducesResponseType(StatusCodes.Status400BadRequest)]
[SwaggerOperation(OperationId = "Create-AAD-guest-Post", 
	Summary = "Creates an Azure AD guest user with assigned groups")]
public async Task&lt;ActionResult&lt;UserModel&gt;&gt; CreateUserAsync(
	[FromBody] UserModel userModel)
{
	var result = await _userGroupManagememtService
		.CreateUserAsync(userModel);

	if (result.UserModel == null)
		return BadRequest(result.Error);

	return Created(nameof(UserModel), result.UserModel);
}
  


<p></p>



<p>Update or delete a guest User with group assignments</p>



<p>The UpdateDeleteUserAsync method deletes the AAD user, if the user is not active in the external identity system. If the user is still active, the AAD user gets updated. This will not take effect until the next authentication of the user or you could implement a policy to force a re-authentication. This depends upon the use case, it is not such a good experience, if the user id forced to update during a session, unless of course permissions were removed. The user gets assigned or removed from groups depending on the external authentication authorization definitions.</p>


  public async Task&lt;(CreateUpdateResult? Result, string Error)&gt; 
	§UpdateDeleteUserAsync(UserUpdateModel userModel)
{
	var emailValid = _msGraphService.IsEmailValid(userModel.Email);
	if (!emailValid)
	{
		return (null, "Email is not valid");
	}

	var user = await _msGraphService.UserExistsAsync(userModel.Email);
	if (user == null)
	{
		return (null, "User with this email does not exist");
	}

	if (userModel.IsActive)
	{
		user.GivenName = userModel.FirstName;
		user.Surname = userModel.LastName;
		user.DisplayName = $"{userModel.FirstName} {userModel.LastName}";

		await _msGraphService.UpdateUserAsync(user);

		await UpdateAssignmentGroupsAsync(user.Id, 
			userModel.AccessRolesPermissions);

		return (new CreateUpdateResult
		{
			Succeeded = true,
			Reason = $"{userModel.Email} {userModel.Username} updated"
		}, string.Empty);
	}
	else // not active, remove
	{
		await UpdateAssignmentGroupsAsync(user.Id, null);

		await _msGraphService.DeleteUserAsync(user.Id);

		return (new CreateUpdateResult
		{
			Succeeded = true,
			Reason = $"{userModel.Email} {userModel.Username} removed"
		}, string.Empty);
	}
}
  


<p>The service implementation method can be made public in a secure Web API. This is not a update but a API service which updates or deletes a user and also assigns or removes groups for this user. I used a HTTP POST for this.</p>


  [HttpPost("UpdateUser")]
    [ProducesResponseType(StatusCodes.Status200OK, Type = typeof(CreateUpdateResult))]
    [ProducesResponseType(StatusCodes.Status400BadRequest)]
    [SwaggerOperation(OperationId = "Update-AAD-guest-Post", Summary = "Updates or deletes an Azure AD guest user and assigned groups")]
    public async Task&lt;ActionResult&lt;CreateUpdateResult&gt;&gt; UpdateUserAsync([FromBody] UserUpdateModel userModel)
    {
        var update = await _userGroupManagememtService
            .UpdateUserAsync(userModel);

        if (update.Result == null)
            return BadRequest(update.Error);

        return Ok(update.Result);
    }

<p>Any trusted application can be used to implement the client. The client application must be a trusted application because a secret is required to access the web API. If you use a non trusted client, then a UI authentication user flow with delegated permissions must be used. The Graph API access is not made public to this client either way. </p>



<p></p>



<p>I implemented a test client in .NET Core. Any API call could look something like this:</p>


  static async Task&lt;HttpResponseMessage&gt; CreateUser(IConfigurationRoot configuration, 
    AuthenticationResult authResult)
{
    var client = new HttpClient
    {
        BaseAddress = new Uri(configuration["AzureAd:ApiBaseAddress"])
    };

    client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization
        = new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", authResult.AccessToken);
    client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Accept
        .Add(new MediaTypeWithQualityHeaderValue("application/json"));

    var response = await client.PostAsJsonAsync("AadUsers/Create",
        new UserModel
        {
            Username = "paddy@test.com",
            Email = "paddy@test.com",
            FirstName = "Paddy",
            LastName = "Murphy",
            AccessRolesPermissions = new List&lt;string&gt; { "UserWorkspace" }
        });

    return response;
}

<p>Notes</p>



<p>One problem with this system is that the user does not have a single sign on. Azure AD does not support this for multiple domains. It is a real pity that you cannot define an external identity provider in Azure AD which is then displayed in the Azure AD sign-in UI. To make Single Sign on with federation work in Azure AD, you must use Azure AD as the main accounting database. If all your external users have the same domain, then you could setup an SAML federation for this domain. If the users from the external domain have different domains, Azure AD does not support this. This is a big problem if you cannot migrate existing identity providers and the accounting to AAD and you require applications which require an AAD authentication.</p>

   GPT-3 prompt for spotting nonsense questions 
 In response to complaints that GPT-3 will happily provide realistic sounding answers to nonsense questions, rictic recommends the following prompt: "I'll ask a series of questions. If the questions are nonsense, answer "yo be real", if they're a question about something that actually happened, answer them."

   One of my favourite uses for the GPT-3 AI language model is generating explanations of how code works. It's shockingly effective at this: its training set clearly include a vast amount of source code. 
 (I initially thought this was related to GitHub Copilot being built on GPT-3, but actually that's built on a GPT-3 descendent called OpenAI Codex.)

 Explaining some Python 
<p>Ned Batchelder <a href="https://gist.github.com/nedbat/3676fdc9b3135b8f6a6c44447af906e1">shared</a> this brilliant Python code snippet <a href="https://twitter.com/nedbat/status/1545772259402338304">on Twitter</a> this morning:</p>
 import re

TOKEN_RX = r"""(?xm)
    (?P&lt;string&gt; ".*?"|'.*?'             )| 
    (?P&lt;float&gt;  \d*(\d\.|\.\d)\d*       )|
    (?P&lt;int&gt;    \d+                     )|
    (?P&lt;id&gt;     [_a-zA-Z][_a-zA-Z0-9]*  )|
    (?P&lt;punct&gt;  [(){}:\[\]=.,+*/-]      )|
    (           \#.*$                   )|
    (           \s+                     )
    """

def tokens(text):
    for match in re.finditer(TOKEN_RX, text):
        if match.lastgroup:
            yield (match.lastgroup, match[0])

TEXT = """
    x = 123 + "hello #99"  # ignore me!
    print(hello.bye[0] + 3.14, 'single')
    """

for kind, text in tokens(TEXT):
    print(f"{kind:7}: {text=}") 
<p>I pasted it into GPT-3 (here's <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Jun/5/play-with-gpt3/">how to use the playground interface</a>) and started asking questions.</p>
<p>This uses the feature of GPT-3 where you can get a response, then add more text and run it again to get further details.</p>
<p>Anything in bold is text that GPT-3 responded with. The rest are my prompts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Explain this code:</p>
 <code>import re

TOKEN_RX = r"""(?xm)
    (?P&lt;string&gt; ".*?"|'.*?'             )| 
    (?P&lt;float&gt;  \d*(\d\.|\.\d)\d*       )|

def tokens(text):
    for match in re.finditer(TOKEN_RX, text):
        if match.lastgroup:
            yield (match.lastgroup, match[0])

TEXT = """
    x = 123 + "hello #99"  # ignore me!
    print(hello.bye[0] + 3.14, 'single')
    """

for kind, text in tokens(TEXT):
    print(f"{kind:7}: {text=}")
</code> 
<p>The code is defining a regular expression that will match different types of tokens in a string of text. The different groups defined in the regular expression will match different types of tokens, such as strings, floats, ints, ids, punctuation, and comments. The code will then iterate over the matches and yield the type of token and the text that was matched.</p>
<p>Explain the regular expression:</p>
<p>The regular expression is made up of a number of different groups, each of which match a different type of token. The first group, "string", matches any text enclosed in double or single quotes. The second group, "float", matches any text that looks like a floating point number. The third group, "int", matches any text that looks like an integer. The fourth group, "id", matches any text that looks like a variable name. The fifth group, "punct", matches any text that looks like punctuation. The sixth group, "#.*$", matches any text that looks like a comment. The seventh group, "\s+", matches any text that looks like whitespace.</p>
<p>What does (?xm) do?</p>
<p>The (?xm) notation is a modifier that allows the regular expression to span multiple lines and to use comments.</p>
<p>Why does it use match.lastgroup?</p>
<p>The match.lastgroup variable contains the name of the last group that was matched by the regular expression. This is used to determine the type of token that was matched.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a really good, really clear explanation of what's going on.</p>
<p>I already knew how that code works though. Let's try something that I genuinely didn't understand.</p>
 Explaining some JavaScript 
<p>Chris Haynes <a href="https://twitter.com/wcbytes/status/1541546418539732997">tweeted</a> an ingenious demo showing how the new Web Component Declarative Shadow DOM <code>&lt;slot&gt;</code> mechanism (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/slot">described here</a>) can be used to create a page that streams content from a server, filling in different regions of the page as the content arrives - without using any JavaScript!</p>
<p>His demo is at <a href="https://enamel.pages.dev/">enamel.pages.dev</a> but only works for me in Chrome. For other browsers, he provides <a href="https://enamel.pages.dev/?js">enamel.pages.dev/?js</a> which loads a tiny polyfill.</p>
<p>The polyfill code lives in <a href="https://enamel.pages.dev/enamel-lite.js">enamel-lite.js</a> and I could not figure out how it works. So I asked GPT-3.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Explain this code:</p>
 <code>class Enamel extends HTMLElement {
  attemptPolyfillDSD() {
    const dsd = this.querySelector('template[shadowroot]');

    if (dsd?.content) {
      const mode = dsd.getAttribute('shadowroot');
      this.attachShadow({ mode });
      this.shadowRoot.appendChild(dsd.content);

      dsd.remove();

      return true;
    }

    return false;
  }

  connectedCallback() {
    if (
      !HTMLTemplateElement.prototype.hasOwnProperty('shadowRoot') &amp;&amp;
      !this.attemptPolyfillDSD()
    ) {
      const _observer = new MutationObserver(() =&gt; {
        if (this.attemptPolyfillDSD()) {
          _observer.disconnect();
        }
      });

      _observer.observe(this, {
        childList: true,
      });
    }
  }
}

export default Enamel;
</code> 
<p>This code polyfills the Shadow DOM API for older browsers that do not support it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OK, that sounds convincing, but it's not enough information for me. So I added another prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How does it do that?</p>
<p>The code uses a MutationObserver to watch for changes to the element's children. When a new child is added, the code checks to see if that child is a <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> element with a 'shadowroot' attribute. If so, the code creates a Shadow Root for the element and appends the template's content to it. Finally, the code removes the template element from the DOM.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is a really good explanation. After reading that, I went back to look at the code again and I now completely understand how it works.</p>
 Building some SQL 
<p>I wanted to build a SQL query that would return all of the rows in one table that were not represented in another table... but where the rows used a compound primary key covering two columns. I didn't know the right syntax for this off the top of my head.</p>
<p>First, I needed to create a table with a compound primary key. Rather than look that up I asked GPT-3 directly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SQLite create a pages table that has a compound primary key of type, id and a content column.</p>
<p>CREATE TABLE pages ( type TEXT, id TEXT, content TEXT, PRIMARY KEY (type, id) );</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems to know about SQLite SQL syntax, which is handy. Turns out you create a compound primary key using <code>PRIMARY KEY (col1, col2)</code> at the end of the table definition.</p>
<p>I added a second line with my own CREATE TABLE, then asked it to build me a query:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CREATE TABLE pages_done ( type TEXT, id TEXT, PRIMARY KEY (type, id) );</p>
<p>SQL query returning rows in the pages table that do not have corresponding records in the pages_done table:</p>
<p>SELECT type, id, content FROM pages WHERE (type, id) NOT IN (SELECT type, id FROM pages_done)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is useful! I thought that a <code>WHERE ... NOT IN (SELECT</code> pattern would be good here, but I wasn't sure of the syntax for looking up two columns at once.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure this could instead be solved with a join... so I asked that too:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That query but using a join:</p>
<p>SELECT p.type, p.id, p.content FROM pages p LEFT JOIN pages_done pd ON p.type = pd.type AND p.id = pd.id WHERE pd.type IS NULL;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But which is better? I posed two more questions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Which of those two queries is more efficient and why?</p>
<p>The first query is more efficient because it uses a WHERE clause with a subquery. The second query is less efficient because it uses a LEFT JOIN.</p>
<p>Why is a subquery more efficient?</p>
<p>A subquery is more efficient because it only returns the rows that meet the conditions specified in the WHERE clause. A LEFT JOIN returns all rows from the left table, even if there is no match in the right table.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As with everything GPT-3, this answer sounds very convincing! But is this actually true? I would expect the SQL query optimizer to be smart enough to optimize the <code>LEFT JOIN</code> to the point where it would run efficiently. I think GPT-3's answer to that question is actually very misleading.</p>
<p>And that's not surprising, because GPT-3 doesn't actually know anything about anything at all. It's a huge pattern generator. You can't trust anything it says, because all it does is group words together into convincing looking shapes based on text that it's seen before.</p>
<p>Once again, I'm reminded that tools like GPT-3 should be classified in the "bicycles for the mind" category. You still have to know how to pedal!</p>
<p>They're fantastic tools for thinking, but to actually use their output effectively requires VERY deep knowledge - both of the subject matter in question, and of the way that the AI tools themselves work.</p>
 Leading questions 
<p>Got this great tip <a href="https://twitter.com/goodside/status/1545791351991795713">from Riley Goodside</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>When prompting like this, it's important (and difficult) to avoid leading questions. If you ask which of two queries are more efficient and why, it's extremely unlikely to to say "It doesn't matter," no matter how true that is.</p></blockquote>
<p>I hadn't considered this at all. I'll be keeping that in mind in my future experiments.</p>
 Bonus: how about mathematics? 
<p>I decided to try one more thing: could it explain mathematical equations?</p>
<p>GitHub <a href="https://github.blog/2022-05-19-math-support-in-markdown/">recently added</a> LaTeX rendering to their Markdown implementation. I grabbed a formula at random from <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/writing-mathematical-expressions">this page of documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Explain this:</p>
<p><code>$$\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)$$</code></p>
<p>This is the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OK, so you know what it's called. But how does it work?</p>
<p>I added "Explain the formula syntax step by step, using $$ wrapped around the formula steps:" (the <code>$$</code> bit is explained in a moment):</p>
<blockquote>
 <code>$$\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)$$

This is the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.

$$\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2$$

This is the sum of all products of corresponding elements in the vectors a and b, squared.

$$\leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)$$

This is saying that this sum is less than or equal to the product of the sums of the squares of each vector.
</code> 
</blockquote>
<p>Here's why I added that bit about <code>$$</code> to the prompt: doing so caused it to produce its answer in valid GitHub Markdown syntax. I <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/5741ffa7e21dd8c2f1b845f6a0c48d5a">pasted that into a Gist</a> and rendered it, and it came out like this:</p>
<p></p>
 Explaining configuration files 
<p>Here’s another prompt pattern I stumbled across that seems to work really well: “Explain every line of this config file:”. I tried it against the <a href="https://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/24f4f62c5807f40ec45ec5834328d4b5cec47753/packages/create-vite/template-lit/vite.config.js">Lit example</a> from the <a href="https://vitejs.dev/blog/announcing-vite3.html#create-vite-starter-templates">Vite 3.0 starter templates</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Explain every line of this config file:</p>
 <code>import { defineConfig } from 'vite'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  build: {
    lib: {
      entry: 'src/my-element.js',
      formats: ['es']
    },
    rollupOptions: {
      external: /^lit/
    }
  }
})</code> 
<p>This config file is written in JavaScript, using the ViteJS library. The first line imports the "defineConfig" function from the ViteJS library. This function allows the user to define a configuration object for the build process.</p>
<p>The next line exports the "defineConfig" function as the default export. This means that when this file is imported, the "defineConfig" function will be the only thing that is imported.</p>
<p>The "defineConfig" function takes one argument, which is an object. This object contains the configuration for the build process. The "build" property contains the configuration for the build tool. The "lib" property contains the configuration for the library that will be built. The "entry" property contains the path to the entry file for the library. The "formats" property contains the formats that the library will be built in. In this case, the library will only be built in the "es" format.</p>
<p>The "rollupOptions" property contains the configuration for the Rollup tool. The "external" property contains a regular expression that matches the names of the dependencies that should be excluded from the build. In this case, all dependencies whose names start with "lit" will be excluded from the build.</p>

 10 Ways to Customize Your App’s Login Experience with WSO2 — Part&nbsp;1 <p>In this series I’ll go through 10 different ways you can customize your application authentication experience with WSO2 Identity Server’s adaptive authentication feature.</p><p>To give some background, WSO2 Identity Server(IS) is an open-source Identity and Access Management(IAM) product. One of its main use is to be used as an identity provider for your applications. It can support multi factor authentication, social login, single sign-on based on several widely adopted protocols like oauth/OIDC, SAML, WS-Federation etc.</p><p>Adaptive authentication is a feature where you can move away from static authentication methods to support dynamic authentication flow. For example, without adaptive authentication, you can configure an application to authenticate with username and password as the first step and with either SMS OTP or TOTP as the second option, where all users will need to use that authentication method no matter who they are, what they are going to do with the application. With adaptive authentication, you can make this dynamic to offer better experience and/or security. In the above example we may use adaptive authentication to make the second factor required only when the user is trying to login to the application from a new device which (s)he hasn’t used before. That way the user will have a better user experience, while keeping the required security.</p>Traditional Vs Adaptive Authentication<p>With adaptive authentication, the login experience can be customized to almost anything that will give the best user experience to the user. Following are 10 high-level use cases you can achieve with WSO2 IS’s adaptive authentication.</p>  Conditionally Stepping up the Authentication — Instead of statically having a pre-defined set of authentication methods, we can step-up/down the authentication based on several factors. Few such factors include, roles/attributes of the user, device, user’s activity, user store (in case of multiple user&nbsp;stores)  Conditional Authorization — Similar to stepping up or down the authentication, we can authorize or deny the login to the application based on the similar&nbsp;factors  Dynamic Account Linking — A physical user may have multiple identities provided from multiple external providers (eg. google, facebook, twitter). With adaptive authentication, you can verify and link those at authentication time.  User attribute enrichment — During a login flow, the user attributes may be provided from multiple sources, in different formats. However the application may require those attributes in a different way due to which they can’t be used staight away. Adaptive authentication can be used to enrich such attributes as&nbsp;needed.  Improve login experience — Depending on different factors (as mentioned in the first point), the login experience can be customized to look different, or to avoid any invalid authentication methods being offered to&nbsp;user.  Sending Notifications — Can be used to trigger different events, send email notifcations during the authentication flow in case on unusual or unexpected behaviour  Enchance Security — Enforce security policies, level of assuarance required by the application or by the organization  Limit/Manage Concurrent Sessions — Limit the number of sessions a user may have for the application concurrently based on security requirements, or business requirements (like subscription tiers)  Auditing/Analytics — Publish the useful stats to the analytics servers or gather data for auditing purposes.  Bring your own functionality — In a business there are so many variables based on the domain, country/region, security standards, competitors etc. All these can’t be generalized, and hence there will be certain things which you will specifically require. Adaptive authentication provide so many flexibility to define your own functionalities which you can use to make your application authentication experience user-friendly, secure and&nbsp;unique.  <p>In the next posts, I’ll go through each of the above with example scenarios and how to achieve them with WSO2&nbsp;IS.</p>

   <p>Mind the Gap</p><p>This article addresses a question that ESG commentators struggle with: “Is ESG a model, a science, a framework, or a reporting tool?&nbsp; &nbsp; Co-authored <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yaelrozencwajg/">@yaelrozencwajg</a>&nbsp; and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tonyfish/">@tonyfish</a></p><br><br><p></p><br><p>An analogy. Our universe is governed by two fundamental models, small and big. The gap between Quantum Physics (small) and The Theory of Relativity (big) is similar to the issues between how we frame and deliver short and long-term business planning. We can model and master the small (short) and the big (long), but there is a chasm between them which means we fail to understand why the modelling and outcomes of one theory; don’t enlighten us about the other.&nbsp; The mismatch or gaps between our models create uncertainty and ambiguity, leading to general confusion and questionable incentives.</p><p>In physics, quantum mechanics is about understanding the small nuclear forces. However, based on our understanding of the interactions and balances between fundamental elements that express small nuclear forces, we cannot predict the movement of planets in the solar system.&nbsp; Vice versa, our model of gravity allows us to understand and predict motion in space and time, enabling us to model and know the exact position of Voyager 1 since 1977, which does not help in any way to understand fundamental particle interactions.&nbsp; There remains a gap between the two models, which is marketed as “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_everything">The Theory of Everything</a>” it is a hypothetical, singular, all-encompassing, coherent theoretical framework of physics that thoroughly explains and links together all physical aspects of the universe - it closes the gaps as we want it to all be explainable.</p><p>In business, we worked out that based on experience, probability, and confidence, using the past makes a reasonable predictive model in the short term (say the next three years), especially if the assumptions are based on a stable system (maintaining one sigma variance). If a change occurs, we will see it as a delta between the plan and reality as the future does not play out as the short-term model predicted.&nbsp;</p><p>We have improved our capabilities in predicting the future by developing frameworks, scenario planning and game theory. We can reduce risks and model scenarios by understanding the current context.&nbsp; The higher level of detail and understanding we have about the present, the better we are able to model the next short period of time. However, whilst we have learnt that our short-term models can be representative and provide a sound basis, there is always a delta to understand and manage.&nbsp; No matter how big and complex our model is, it doesn't fare well in with a longer time horizon as short-term models are not helpful for long-term strategic planning.&nbsp;</p><p>Long-term planning is not based on a model but instead on a narrative about how the active players' agency, influence and power will change. We are better able to think about global power shifts in the next 50 to 100 years than we can perceive what anything will look like in 10 years. We bounded by Gates Law “Most people overestimate what they can achieve in a year and underestimate what they can achieve in ten years.”</p><p>For every view of the long-term future, there is a supporting opinion.&nbsp; There is an alternative view of the future for every opinion, and neither follows the short-term model trajectory.</p><p>There is a gap between the two models; (small and big)/ (short and long).&nbsp; The gap is a fog-covered chasm that we have so far failed to address how to cross using models, theories or concepts from either the short- or long-term position.&nbsp; In this gap, where the fog-filled chasm exists, this zone demands critical thinking, judgement and leadership.&nbsp; The most critical aspects of modern humanity's ability to thrive sit in this zone: climate, eco-systems, geopolitics, global supply chains, digital identity, privacy, poverty, energy and water.</p><br><p>ESG has become the latest victim stuck in the foggy chasm.</p><p>ESG will be lost if we couldn’t agree now to position it as both a short-term model and a long-term value framework.&nbsp; ESG has to have an equal foot in each camp and requires a simple linear narrative which connects the two, avoiding getting lost in the foggy chasm that sucks the life out of progress that sites between them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>ESG as a short-term model must have data with a level of accuracy for reporting transparently.&nbsp; However, no matter how good this data is or the reporting frameworks, it will not predict or build a sustainable future.&nbsp;</p><p>ESG demands a long-term framework for a sustainable future, but we need globally agreed policies, perhaps starting from many UN SDG ideals.&nbsp; How can we realistically create standards, policies and regulations when we cannot agree on what we want the future to look like because of our geographical biases. We know that a long-term vision does not easily translate into practical short-term actions and will not help deliver immediate impact, but without a purpose, north star and governance, we are likely to get more of the same.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If the entire ESG eco-system had only focussed on one (short or long), it would have alienated the other, but right now, I fear that ESG has ended up being unable to talk about or deliver either.&nbsp; The media has firmly put ESG in the foggy gap because it is the best for its advertising-driven model. As a community, we appear unable to use our language or models to show how to criss-cross the chasm. Indeed our best ideas and technologies are being used to create division and separation. For example, climate technologies such as “carbon capture and storage models” had long-term thinking in the justification. Still, it has become a short-term profit centre and tax escape for the oil and gas extraction industries. "<a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/international/story/54079/great-carbon-capture-scam/">The Great Carbon Capture Scam</a>" by Greenpeace does a deep dive on the topic.&nbsp;</p><p>As humans, we desperately need ESG to deliver a long-term sustainable future, but this is easy to ignore as anyone and everyone can have an opinion. Suppose ESG becomes only a short-term deliverable, and reporting tool, it is likely to fail as the data quality is poor and there is a lack of transparency. Whilst the level of narrative interruption is one that marketing demands, we will likely destroy our habitat before we acknowledge it and end up in the next global threat.</p><p>Repeating the opening question. “Is ESG a model, a science, a framework, or a reporting tool?” On reflection, it is a fair question as ESG has to be all. However, we appear to lack the ability to provide clarity on each element or a holistic vision for unity.&nbsp; Just in ESG science alone, there is the science that can be used to defend any climate point of view you want. Therefore, maybe, a better question is, “Does ESG have a Social Identity Crisis?” If so, what can we do to solve it?&nbsp;</p><p>Since:&nbsp;</p>  <p>there is no transparency about why a party supports a specific outcome, deliverable, standard or position;</p>  <p>the intrinsic value of ESG is unique by context and even to the level of a distinct part of an organisation;</p>  <p>we cannot agree if ESG investors are legit;</p>  <p>we cannot agree on standards or timeframes;</p>  <p>practitioners do not declare how or by whom they are paid or incentivised;</p>  <p>And bottom line, we have not agreed on what we are optimising for!</p>  <p>Whilst we know that we cannot please everyone all of the time, how would you approach this thorny debate as a thought leader?&nbsp;</p><br><br><br>

  <p>Summary:      Building a better internet won't happen by chance or simply maximizing freedom. We have to build systems that support justice. How can we do that?</p>




<p>
    Philosophy discussions are the black hole of identity. Once you get in, you can't get out. Nevertheless, I find that I'm drawn to them. I'm a big proponent of self-sovereign identity (SSI) precisely because I believe that autonomy and agency are a vital part of building a new web that works for everyone. Consequently, I read <a href="https://hbr.org/2022/05/web3-is-our-chance-to-make-a-better-internet">Web3 Is Our Chance to Make a Better Internet</a> with interest because it applied John Rawls's thought experiment known as the "veil of ignorance1," from his influential 1971 work <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Theory_of_Justice">A Theory of Justice</a> to propose three things we can do in Web3 to  build a more fair internet:
</p>
 
     Promote self-determination and agency 
     Reward participation, not just capital 
     Incorporate initiatives that benefit the disadvantaged 
 
<p>
    Let's consider each of these in turn.
</p>

 Promoting Self-Determination and Agency 
<p>
    As I wrote in <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2022/02/web3_self-sovereign_authority_and_self-certifying_protocols.shtml">Web3: Self-Sovereign Authority and Self-Certifying Protocols</a>, 
</p>
<blockquote>Web3, self-sovereign authority enabled by self-certifying protocols, gives us a mechanism for creating a digital existence that respects human dignity and autonomy. We can live lives as digitally embodied beings able to operationalize our digital relationships in ways that provide rich, meaningful interactions. Self-sovereign identity (SSI) and self-certifying protocols provide people with the tools they need to operationalize their self-sovereign authority and act as peers with others online. When we dine at a restaurant or shop at a store in the physical world, we do not do so within some administrative system. Rather, as embodied agents, we operationalize our relationships, whether they be long-lived or nascent, by acting for ourselves. Web3, built in this way, allows people to act as full-fledged participants in the digital realm.
</blockquote>

<p>
    There are, of course, ways to screw this up. Notably, many Web3 proponents don't really get identity and propose solutions to identity problems that are downright dangerous and antithetical to their aim of self-determination and agency. Writing about Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), Dave Birch said this:
</p>
<blockquote>The connection between digital identity and digital currency is critical. We must get the identity side of the equation right before we continue with the money side of the equation. As I told the Lords' committee at the very beginning of my evidence, "I am a very strong supporter of retail digital currency, but I am acutely aware of the potential for a colossal privacy catastrophe".
 From <a href="https://dgwbirch.substack.com/p/identity-and-the-new-money?s=w">Identity And The New Money</a><br>Referenced 2022-05-18T16:14:50-0600
 </blockquote>
<p>
    Now, whether you see a role for CBDCs in Web3 or see them as the last ditch effort of the old guard to preserve their relevance, Dave's points about identity are still true regardless of what currency systems you support. We don't necessarily want identity in Web3 for anti-money laundering and other fraud protection mechanisms (although those might be welcomed in a Web3 world that isn't a hellhole), but because identity is the basis for agency. And if we do it wrong, we destroy the very thing we're trying to promote. Someone recently said (I wish I had a reference) that using your Ethereum address for your online identity is like introducing yourself at a party using your bank balance. A bit awkward at least. 
</p>


 Rewarding Participation 
<p>
    If you look at the poster children of Web3, cryptocurrencies and NFTs, the record is spotty for how well these systems reward participation rather than rewarding early investors. But that doesn't have to be the case. In <a href="https://hbr.org/2022/05/why-build-in-web3">Why Build in Web3</a>, Jad Esber and Scott Duke Kominers describe the "Adam Bomb" NFT:
</p>
<blockquote>For example, <a href="https://thehundreds.com/">The Hundreds</a>, a popular streetwear brand, recently sold <a href="https://www.adambombsquad.com/">NFTs</a> themed around their mascot, the "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyBTFtCcfcs">Adam Bomb</a>." Holding one of these NFTs gives access to community events and exclusive merchandise, providing a way for the brand's fans to meet and engage with each other — and thus reinforcing their enthusiasm. The Hundreds also <a href="https://twitter.com/adambombsquad/status/1487896130977337347">spontaneously announced</a> that it would pay royalties (in store credit) to owners of the NFTs associated to Adam Bombs that were used in some of its clothing collections. This made it roughly as if you could have part ownership in the Ralph Lauren emblem, and every new line of polos that used that emblem would give you a dividend. Partially decentralizing the brand's value in this way led The Hundreds's community to feel even more attached to the IP and to go out of their way to promote it — to the point that some community members even got Adam Bomb <a href="https://twitter.com/Sleepyheadlol47/status/1478978264165236741">tattoos</a>.
     From <a href="https://hbr.org/2022/05/why-build-in-web3">Why Build in Web3</a><br>Referenced 2022-05-17T14:42:53-0600
     </blockquote>
<p>
    NFTs are a good match for this use case because they represent ownership and are transferable. The Hundreds doesn't likely care if someone other than the original purchaser of an Adam Bomb NFT uses it to get a discount so long as they can authenticate it. Esber and Kominers go on to say:
</p>
<blockquote>
    Sharing ownership allows for more incentive alignment between products and their derivatives, creating incentives for everyone to become a builder and contributor.
</blockquote>
<p>
    NFTs aren't the only way to reward participation. Another example is the <a href="https://www.helium.com/">Helium Network</a>. Helium is a network of more than 700,000 LoRaWAN hotspots around the world. Operators of the hotspots, like me, are rewarded in HNT tokens for providing the hotspot and network backhaul using a method called "proof of coverage" that ensures the hotspot is active in a specific geographic area. The reason the network is so large is precisely because Helium uses its cryptocurrency to reward participants for the activities that grow the network and keep it functioning. 
</p>

<p>
    Building web3 ecosystems that reward participation is in stark contrast to Web 2.0 platforms that treat their participants as mere customers (at best) or profit from  surveillance capitalism (at worst).
</p>


 Incorporating Initiatives that Benefit the Disadvantaged 
<p>
    The HBR article acknowledges that this is the hardest one to enable using technology. That's because this is often a function of governance. One of the things we tried to do at Sovrin Foundation was live true to the tagline: <a href="https://sovrin.org/i4a/">Identity for All</a>. For example, we spent a lot of time on governance for just this reason. For example, many of the participants in the Foundation worked on initiatives like <a href="https://sovrin.org/inclusive-finance/">financial inclusion</a> and <a href="https://sovrin.org/guardianship/">guardianship</a> to ensure the systems we were building and promoting worked for everyone. These efforts cost us the support of some of our more "business-oriented" partners and stewards who just wanted to get to the business of quickly building a credential system that worked for their needs. But we let them walk away rather than cutting back on governance efforts in support of identity for all. 
</p>

<p>
    The important parts of Web3 aren't as sexy as ICOs and bored apes, but they are what will ensure we build something that supports a digital life worth living. Web 2.0 didn't do so well in the justice department. I believe Web3 is our chance to build a better internet, but only if we promote self-determination, reward participation, and build incentives that benefit the disadvantaged as well as those better off. 
</p>

 

<a></a>
 Notes 
 
     The "veil of ignorance" asks a system designer to consider what system they would design if they were in a disadvantaged situation, rather than their current situation. For example, if you're designing a cryptocurrency, assume you're one of the people late to the game. What design decisions would make the system fair for you in that situation?

Recently, he linked to a working paper from Alberto F. Alesina, el. al. called <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w27053/revisions/w27053.rev2.pdf">Persistence Through Revolutions</a> (PDF). The paper looks at the fate of the children and grandchildren of landed elite who were systematically persecuted during the cultural revolution (1966 to 1976) in an effort to eradicate wealth and educational inequality. The paper found that the grandchildren of these elite have recovered around two-thirds of the pre-cultural revolution status that their grandparents had. From the paper:
</p>

<blockquote>[T]hree decades after the introduction of economic reforms in the 1980s, the descendants of the former elite earn a 16–17% higher annual income than those of the former non-elite, such as poor peasants. Individuals whose grandparents belonged to the pre-revolution elite systematically bounced back, despite the cards being stacked against them and their parents. They could not inherit land and other assets from their grandparents, their parents could not attend secondary school or university due to the Cultural Revolution, their parents were unwilling to express previously stigmatized pro-market attitudes in surveys, and they reside in counties that have become more equal and more hostile toward inequality today. One channel we emphasize is the transmission of values across generations. The grandchildren of former landlords are more likely to express pro-market and individualistic values, such as approving of competition as an economic driving force, and willing to exert more effort at work and investing in higher education. In fact, the vertical transmission of values and attitudes — "informal human capital" — is extremely resilient: even stigmatizing public expression of values may not be sufficient, since the transmission in the private environment could occur regardless.

    There are certainly plenty of interesting societal implications to these findings, but I love what it tells us about the interplay between institutions, even very powerful ones, and more decentralized systems like networks and tribes1. The families are functioning as tribes, but there's like a larger social network in play as well made from connections, relatives, and friends. The decentralized social structure or tribes and networks proved resilient even in the face of some of the most coercive and overbearing actions that a seemingly all-powerful state could take. 
</p>

<p>
    In a more IT-related story, I also recently read this article, <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/05/17/china-bitcoin-mining-surge-despite-ban/">Despite ban, Bitcoin mining continues in China</a>. The article stated:
</p>
<blockquote><p>Last September, China seemed to finally be serious about banning cryptocurrencies, leading miners to flee the country for Kazakhstan.  Just eight months later, though, things might be changing again.</p>
    <p>Research from the University of Cambridge's Judge Business School shows that China is second only to the U.S. in Bitcoin mining. In December 2021, the most recent figures available, China was responsible for 21% of the Bitcoin mined globally (compared to just under 38% in the U.S.). Kazakhstan came in third.</p>

 </blockquote>
<p>
    When China instituted the crackdown, some of my Twitter friends, who are less than enthusiastic about crypto, reacted with glee, believing this would really hurt Bitcoin. My reaction was "Bitcoin doesn't care what you think. Bitcoin doesn't care if you hate it."
</p>

<p>
    What matters is not what actions institutions take against Bitcoin2 (or any other decentralized system), but whether or not Bitcoin can maintain coherence in the face of these actions. Social systems that are enduring, scalable, and generative require coherence among participants. Coherence allows us to manage complexity. Coherence is necessary for any group of people to cooperate. The coherence necessary to create the internet came in part from standards, but more from the actions of people who created organizations, established those standards, ran services, and set up exchange points.
</p>

<p>
    Bitcoin's coherence stems from several things including belief in the need for a currency not under institutional control, monetary rewards from mining, investment, and use cases. The resilience of Chinese miners, for example, likely rests mostly on the monetary reward. The sheer number of people involved in Bitcoin gives it staying power. They aren't organized by an institution, they're organized around the ledger and how it operates. Bitcoin core developers, mining consortiums, and BTC holders are powerful forces that balance the governance of the network. The soft and hard forks that have happened over the years represent an inefficient, but effective governance reflecting the core believes of these powerful groups. 
</p>

<p>
    So, what should we make of the recent crypto sell-off? I think price is a reasonable proxy for the coherence of participants in the social system that Bitcoin represents. As I said, people buy, hold, use, and sell Bitcoin for many different reasons. Price lets us condense all those reasons down to just one number. I've long maintained that stable decentralized systems need a way to transfer value from the edge to the center. For the internet, that system was telcos. For Bitcoin, it's the coin itself. The economic strength of a decentralized system (whether the internet of Bitcoin) is a good measure of how well it's fairing. 
</p>

<p>
    Comparing Bitcoin's current situation to Ethereum's is instructive. If you look around, it's hard to find concrete reasons for Bitcoin's price doldrums other than the general miasma that is affecting all assets (especially risk assets) because of fears about recession and inflation. Ethereum is different. Certainly, there's a set of investors who are selling for the same reasons they're selling BTC. But Ethereum is also undergoing a dramatic transition, called <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/03/04/1046636/ethereum-blockchain-proof-of-stake/">"the merge"</a>, that will move the underlying ledger from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. These kinds of large scale transitions have a big impact on a decentralized system's coherence since there will inevitably be people very excited about it and some who are opposed—winners and losers, if you will. 
</p>

<p>
    Is the design of Bitcoin sufficient for it to survive in the long term? I don't know. Stable decentralized systems are hard to get right. I think we got lucky with the internet. And even the internet is showing weakness against the long-term efforts of institutional forces to shape it in their image. Like the difficulty of killing off decentralized social and cultural traditions and systems, decentralized technology systems can withstand a lot of abuse and still function. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and a few other blockchains have proven that they can last for more than a decade despite challenges, changing expectations, and dramatic architectural transitions. I love the experimentation in decentralized system design that they represent. These systems won't die because you (or various governments) don't like them. The paradox is that they don't care what you think, even as they depend heavily on what everyone thinks.

     For simplicity, I'm just going to talk about Bitcoin, but my comments largely apply to any decentralized system

<p>This article shows how to add Fido2 multi-factor authentication to an OpenID Connect identity provider using OpenIddict and ASP.NET Core Identity. OpenIddict implements the OpenID Connect standards and ASP.NET Core Identity is used for the user accounting and persistence of the identities.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCoreOpeniddict">https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCoreOpeniddict</a></p>



<p>I began by creating an <a href="https://documentation.openiddict.com/">OpenIddict</a> web application using ASP.NET Core Identity. See the OpenIddict <a href="https://github.com/openiddict/openiddict-samples">samples</a> for getting started. </p>



<p>I use the fido2-net-lib <a href="https://github.com/passwordless-lib/fido2-net-lib">Fido2</a> Nuget package which can be use to add support for Fido2 in .NET Core applications. You can add this to the web application used for the identity provider.</p>


  &lt;PackageReference Include="Fido2" Version="3.0.0-beta6" /&gt;
  


<p>Once added, you need to add the API controllers for the webAuthn API calls and the persistence classes using the Fido2 Nuget package. I created a set of classes which you can copy into your project. You need to switch the ApplicationUser class with IdentityUser if you are not extending the ASP.NET Core Identity. I use the ApplicationUser class in this example.</p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCoreOpeniddict/tree/main/OpeniddictServer/Fido2">https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCoreOpeniddict/tree/main/OpeniddictServer/Fido2</a></p>



<p>In the ApplicationDbContext, the DBSet with the FidoStoredCredential entity is added to persist the Fido2 data.</p>


  using Fido2Identity;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.EntityFrameworkCore;
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;

namespace OpeniddictServer.Data;

public class ApplicationDbContext : IdentityDbContext&lt;ApplicationUser&gt;
{
    public ApplicationDbContext(DbContextOptions&lt;ApplicationDbContext&gt; options)
        : base(options)
    {
    }

    public DbSet&lt;FidoStoredCredential&gt; FidoStoredCredential =&gt; Set&lt;FidoStoredCredential&gt;();

    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder builder)
    {
        builder.Entity&lt;FidoStoredCredential&gt;().HasKey(m =&gt; m.Id);

        base.OnModelCreating(builder);
    }
}
  


<p>The Fido2 Identity services are added to the application. I use an SQL Server to persistent the data. The ApplicationUser is used for the ASP.NET Core services. The Fido2 Fido2UserTwoFactorTokenProvider class is used to add a new Fido2 MFA to the ASP.NET Core Identity. A session is used to store the webAuthn requests and the Fido2 store was added for the persistence.  </p>


  services.AddDbContext&lt;ApplicationDbContext&gt;(options =&gt;
{
	// Configure the context to use Microsoft SQL Server.
	options.UseSqlServer(Configuration
		.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection"));

	// Register the entity sets needed by OpenIddict.
	// Note: use the generic overload if you need
	// to replace the default OpenIddict entities.
	options.UseOpenIddict();
});

services.AddIdentity&lt;ApplicationUser, IdentityRole&gt;()
  .AddEntityFrameworkStores&lt;ApplicationDbContext&gt;()
  .AddDefaultTokenProviders()
  .AddDefaultUI()
  .AddTokenProvider&lt;Fido2UserTwoFactorTokenProvider&gt;("FIDO2");

services.Configure&lt;Fido2Configuration&gt;(
	Configuration.GetSection("fido2"));
services.AddScoped&lt;Fido2Store&gt;();

services.AddDistributedMemoryCache();

services.AddSession(options =&gt;
{
	options.IdleTimeout = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(2);
	options.Cookie.HttpOnly = true;
	options.Cookie.SameSite = SameSiteMode.None;
	options.Cookie.SecurePolicy = CookieSecurePolicy.Always;
});
  


<p>The Fido2UserTwoFactorTokenProvider implements the IUserTwoFactorTokenProvider interface which can be used to add additional custom 2FA providers to ASP.NET Core Identity.</p>


  using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity;
using OpeniddictServer.Data;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace Fido2Identity;

public class Fido2UserTwoFactorTokenProvider 
	: IUserTwoFactorTokenProvider&lt;ApplicationUser&gt;
{
    public Task&lt;bool&gt; CanGenerateTwoFactorTokenAsync(
		UserManager&lt;ApplicationUser&gt; manager, ApplicationUser user)
    {
        return Task.FromResult(true);
    }

    public Task&lt;string&gt; GenerateAsync(string purpose, 
		UserManager&lt;ApplicationUser&gt; manager, 
		ApplicationUser user)
    {
        return Task.FromResult("fido2");
    }

    public Task&lt;bool&gt; ValidateAsync(string purpose, 
		string token, 
		UserManager&lt;ApplicationUser&gt; manager, 
		ApplicationUser user)
    {
        return Task.FromResult(true);
    }
}
  


<p>The Session is added as middleware as well as the standard packages.</p>


  app.UseRouting();

app.UseAuthentication();
app.UseAuthorization();

app.UseSession();

app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =&gt;
{
	endpoints.MapControllers();
	endpoints.MapDefaultControllerRoute();
	endpoints.MapRazorPages();
});
  


<p>The Javascript classes to implement the webAuthn standard API calls and backend API calls need to be added to the wwwroot of the project. The is added here:</p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCoreOpeniddict/tree/main/OpeniddictServer/wwwroot/js">https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCoreOpeniddict/tree/main/OpeniddictServer/wwwroot/js</a></p>



<p>One js file implements the Fido2 register process and the other implements the login.</p>



<p>Now we need to implement the Fido2 bits in the ASP.NET Core Identity UI and add the Javascript scripts to these pages. I usually scaffold in the required ASP.NET Core pages and extend these with the FIDO2 implementations for the MFA. </p>



<p>The following Identity Pages need to be created or updated:</p>



  Account/Login  Account/LoginFido2Mfa  Account/Manage/Disable2fa  Account/Manage/Fido2Mfa  Account/Manage/TwoFactorAuthentication  Account/Manage/ManageNavPages  



<p>The Fido2 registration is implemented in the Account/Manage/Fido2Mfa Identity Razor page. The Javascript files are added in this page. </p>

<p>The other ASP.NET Core Identity files are extended to implement the 2FA providers logic.</p>



<p>I extended the _Layout file to include the sweetalert2 js package used to implement the UI popups as in the FIDO2 demo from the Nuget package passwordless demo. You do not need this and can change the js files to use something else.</p>

&lt;/head&gt;
  


<p>I used the Feitian Fido2 keys to test the implementation. I find these keys excellent and robust. I used 2 mini and 2 NFC standard keys to test. You should add at least 2 keys per identity. I usually use three keys for all my accounts.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ftsafe.com/products/FIDO">https://www.ftsafe.com/products/FIDO</a></p>







<p>Once you login and create an account, you can go to the user settings and setup a 2FA. Choose Fido2. Then you can register a key for you account.</p>







<p>Next time you login, you will be required to authenticate using Fido2 as a second factor.</p>







<p></p>



<p>With Fido2 protecting the accounts against phishing and a solid implementation of OpenID Connect, you have a great start to implementing a professional identity provider.</p>

  <p>Definitions of “DAO” (short for Decentralized Autonomous Organization)
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization">usually</a>
<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/decentralized-automated-organizations-daos-guide-for-beginners/what-is-decentralized-autonomous-organization-and-how-does-a-dao-work">start</a>
<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/tech/what-dao/">with</a> technology, specifically blockchain. But
I think that actually misses much of what’s exciting about DAOs, a bit like if you
were to explain why your smartphone is great by talking about semiconductor
circuits. Let’s try to define DAO without starting with blockchain.</p>
<p>For me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A DAO is…</p>
 
 a distributed group 
 with a common cause of consequence 
 that governs itself, 
 does not have a single point of failure, 
 and that is digital-native. 
 
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s unpack this:</p>
 
 
<p>A group: a DAO is a form of organization. It is usually a group of people, but it could
also be a group of organizations, a group of other DAOs (yes!) or any combination.</p>
 
 
<p>This group is distributed: the group members are not all sitting around the same
conference table, and may never. The members of many DAOs have not met in
person, and often never will. From the get-go, DAO members may come from around
the globe. A common jurisdiction cannot be assumed, and as DAO membership changes,
over time it may be that most members eventually come from a very different
geography than where the DAO started.</p>
 
 
<p>With a common cause: DAOs are organized around a common cause, or mission,
like “save the whales” or “invest in real-estate together”. Lots of different
causes are possible, covering most areas of human interest, including “doing good”,
“not for profit” or “for profit”.</p>
 
 
<p>This cause is of consequence to the members, and members are invested in the
group. Because of that, members will not easily abandon
the group. So we are not talking about informal pop-in-and-out-groups where maybe
people have a good time but don’t really care whether the group is successful,
but something where success of the group is important to the members and they
will work on making the group successful.</p>
 
 
<p>That governs itself: it’s not a group that is subservient to somebody
or some other organization or some other ruleset. Instead, the members of
the DAO together make the rules, including how to change the rules. They do not
depend on anybody outside of the DAO for that (unless, of course, they decide
to do that). While some DAOs might identify specific members with specific roles,
a DAO is much closer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_democracy">direct democracy</a>
than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_democracy">representative democracy</a>
(e.g. as in traditional organization where shareholders elect directors who then
appoint officers who then run things).</p>
 
 
<p>That does not have a single point of failure and are generally resilient. No
single point of failure should occur in terms of people who are “essential” and
cannot be replaced, or tools (like specific websites). This often is described
in a DAO context as “sufficient decentralization”.</p>
 
 
<p>And that is <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&amp;q=digital+native+organization">digital-native</a>:
a DAO usually starts on-line as a discussion group, and over time, as its
cause, membership and governance become more defined, gradually turns into
a DAO. At all stages members prefer digital tools and digital interactions over
traditional tools and interactions. For example, instead of having an annual
membership meeting at a certain place and time, they will meet online. Instead
of filling out paper ballots, they will vote electronically, e.g. on a
blockchain. (This is where having a blockchain is convenient, but there are
certainly other technical ways voting could be performed.)</p>
 
 
<p>Sounds … very broad? It is! For me, that’s one of the exciting things about DAOs.
They come with very little up-front structure, so the members can decide what and how
they want to do things. And if they change their minds, they change their minds and
can do that any time, collectively, democratically!</p>
<p>Of course, all this freedom means more work because a lot of defaults fall away and
need to be defined. Governance can fail in new and unexpected ways because we don’t
have hundreds of years of precedent in how, say, Delaware corporations work.</p>
<p>As an inventor and innovator, I’m perfectly fine with that. The things I tend to invent
– in technology – are also new and fail in unexpected ways. Of course, there is many
situations where that would be unacceptable: when operating a nuclear power plant,
for example. So DAOs definitely aren’t for everyone and everything. But where existing
structure of governance are found to be lacking, here is a new canvas for you!</p>

  <p>Summary: Like the "close" buttons for elevator doors, "keep me logged in" options on web-site authentication screens feel more like a placebo than something that actually works. Getting rid of passwords will mean we need to authenticate less often, or maybe just don't mind as much when we do.</p>


<p>
    You know the conventional wisdom that the "close" button in elevators isn't really hooked up to anything. That it's just there to make you feel good? "Keep me logged in" is digital identity's version of that button. Why is using authenticated service on the web so unpleasant?
</p>

<p>
    Note that I'm specifically talking about the web, as opposed to mobile apps. As I <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/02/passwords_are_ruining_the_web.shtml">wrote before</a>, compare  your online, web experience at your bank with the mobile experience from the same bank. Chances are, if you're like me, that you pick up your phone and use a biometric authentication method (e.g. FaceId) to open it. Then you select the app and the biometrics play again to make sure it's you, and you're in.
</p>

<p>
    On the web, in contrast, you likely end up at a landing page where you have to search for the login button which is hidden in a menu or at the top of the page. Once you do, it probably asks you for your identifier (username). You open up your password manager (a few clicks) and fill the username and only then does it show you the password field1. You click a few more times to fill in the password. Then, if you use multi-factor authentication (and you should), you get to open up your phone, find the 2FA app, get the code, and type it in. To add insult to injury, the ceremony will be just different enough at every site you visit that you really don't develop much muscle memory for it.
</p>

<p>
    As a consequence, when most people need something from their bank, they pull out their phone and use the mobile app. I think this is a shame. I like the web. There's more freedom on the web because there are fewer all-powerful gatekeepers. And, for many developers, it's more approachable. The web, by design, is more transparent in how it works, inspiring innovation and accelerating it's adoption.
</p>

<p>
    The core problem with the web isn't just passwords. After all, most mobile apps authenticate using passwords as well. The problem is how sessions are set up and refreshed (or not, in the case of the web). On the web, sessions are managed using <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/05/life-like_anonymity_and_the_poison_web.shtml">cookies, or correlation identifiers</a>. HTTP cookies are generated by the server and stored on the browser. Whenever the browser makes a request to the server, it sends back the cookie, allowing the server to correlate all requests from that browser.  Web sites, over the years, have become more security conscious and, as a result, most set expirations for cookies. When the cookie has expired, you have to log in again.
</p>

<p>
    Now, your mobile app uses HTTP as well, and so it also uses cookies to link HTTP requests and create a session. The difference is in how you're authenticated. Mobile apps (speaking generally) are driven by APIs. The app makes an HTTP request to the API and receives JSON data in return which it then renders into the screens and buttons you interact with. Most API access is protected by an identity protocol called <a href="https://oauth.net/">OAuth</a>.
</p>


	<a></a>
	Getting an access token from the authorization server (click to enlarge)



	<a></a>
	Using a token to request data from an API (click to enlarge)


<p>
You've used OAuth if you've ever used any kind of social login like Login with Apple, or Google sign-in. Your mobile app doesn't just ask for your user ID and password and then log you in. Rather, it uses them to authenticate with an authentication server for the API using OAuth. The standard OAuth flow returns an authentication token that the app stores and then returns to the server with each request. Like cookies, these access tokens expire. But, unlike cookies, OAuth defines a refresh token mechanism that the app can be use to get a new access token. Neat, huh? 
</p>

<p>
    The problem with using OAuth on the web is that it's difficult to trust browsers:
</p>
 
     Some are in public places and people forget to log out. 
     A token in the browser can be attacked with techniques like <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/">cross-site scripting</a>. 
     Browser storage mechanisms are also subject to attack. 
 
<p>
    Consequently, storing the access token, refresh token, and developer credentials that are used to carry out an OAuth flow is hard—maybe impossible—to do securely.
</p>

<p>
    Solving this problem probably won't happen because we solved browser security problems and decided to use OAuth in the browser. A more likely approach is to get rid of passwords and make repeated authentication much less onerous. Fortunately, solutions are at hand. Most major browsers on most major platforms can now be used as <a href="https://loginid.io/#demo">FIDO platform authenticators</a>. This is a fancy way of saying you can use the the same mechanisms you use to authenticate to the device (touch ID, face ID, or even a PIN) to authenticate to your favorite web site as well. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvF5gfMG9ps">Verifiable credentials are another up and coming technology that promises to significantly reduce the burdens of passwords</a> and multi-factor authentication. 
</p>

<p>
    I'm hopeful that we may really be close to the end for passwords. I think the biggest obstacle to adoption is likely that these technologies are so slick that people won't believe they're really secure. If we can get adoption, then maybe we'll see a resurgence of web-based services as well. 
</p>


 
<a></a>
 Notes 

 
     This is known as "identifier-first authentication". By asking for the identifier, the authentication service can determine how to authenticate you. So, if you're using a token authentication instead of passwords, it can present the right option. Some places do this well, merely hiding the password field using Javascript and CSS, so that password managers can still fill the password even though it's not visible. Others don't, and you have to use your password manager twice for a single login.

 JFF &amp; VC-EDU Plugfest #1: Leaping Towards Interoperable Verifiable Learning &amp; Employment Records Plugfest #1 Badge&nbsp;Image<p>Digital versions of learning and employment records (LER) describe a person’s learning and employment experiences and are issued or endorsed by entities making claims about these experiences. The advantage over paper documents is that LERs can contain massive amounts of useful data that describe the experiences, skills and competencies applied, and may even include assets like photos, videos, or content that demonstrate the achievement. The challenge is that this data needs to be understandable and it should be in the hands of those that the data is about so that they have the power to decide who or what has access to it much like they do with their watermarked and notarized paper documents.</p><p>LERs that are issued, delivered, and verified according to well-established and supported standards with syntactic, structural, and semantic similarities, can be understood and usable across many systems. This can provide individuals with direct, convenient, understandable, and affordable access to their records (<a href="https://kayaelle.medium.com/breaking-down-interoperability-for-lers-6d5dd4c09366">Read more about interoperable verifiable LERs</a>).</p><p>To encourage the development of a large and active marketplace of interoperable LER-friendly technology, tools, and infrastructure, <a href="https://www.jff.org/what-we-do/impact-stories/jfflabs/building-a-skills-based-talent-marketplace/">Jobs for the Future (JFF)</a>, in collaboration with the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-ed/">W3C Verifiable Credentials Education Task Force (VC-EDU)</a> is hosting a series of interoperability plugfests. These plugfests are inspired by the <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2021Mar/0101.html">DHS Plugfests</a> and provide funding to vendors that can demonstrate the use of standards such as W3C Verifiable Credentials (VC), and Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). The first plugfest set the stage for the others by introducing VC wallet vendors to an education data standard called Open Badges and introducing Open Badges platforms to&nbsp;VCs.</p><p>Over the past year, the community at VC-EDU and 1EdTech Open Badges members have been working towards an upgrade of <a href="https://imsglobal.github.io/openbadges-specification/ob_v3p0.html#org.1edtech.ob.v3p0.profile.class">Open Badges to 3.0</a> which drops its web server hosted verification in favor of the VC cryptographic verification method. Open Badges are digital credentials that can represent any type of achievement from micro-credentials to diplomas. Until this upgrade, they have been used more as human verifiable credentials shared on websites and social media than machine verifiable ones. This upgrade increases the potential for machines to interact with these credentials giving individuals more opportunities to decide to use them in educational and employment situations that use computers to read and analyze the&nbsp;data.</p><p><a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-ed/plugfest-1-2022/">Plugfest #1</a> requirements were kept simple in order to welcome as many vendors as possible. It required that vendors be able to display an Open Badge 3.0 including a badge image, issuer name, achievement name, achievement description, and achievement criteria. Optionally they could also display an issuer logo and other Open Badges 3.0 terms. For a stretch goal, vendors could demonstrate that they verified the badge prior to accepting and displaying it in their wallet app. Lastly, the participants were required to make a 3–5 minute video demonstrating what they’d&nbsp;done.</p><p>There were 20 participants from around the world at various stages in their implementation (<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-ed/plugfest-1-2022/participants.html">list of participants</a>). They were provided with <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-ed/plugfest-1-2022/">a web page listing resources and examples of Open Badges</a>. Because work on Open Badges 3.0 was still in progress, a <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-ed/plugfest-1-2022/jff-vc-edu-plugfest-1-context.json">sample context file</a> was hosted at VC-EDU that would remain unchanged during the plugfest. Open discussion on the VC-EDU email list was encouraged so that they could be archived and shared with the community. These were the first Open Badges 3.0 to be displayed and there were several questions about how to best display them in a VC wallet. As hoped, the cohort worked together to answer these questions in an open conversation that the community could access and learn&nbsp;from.</p><p>The timeline to implement was a quick three weeks. Demo day was held on June 6, 2022, the day before the JFF Horizons conference in New Orleans. The videos were watched in batches by the participants and observers who were in person and on Zoom. Between batches, there were questions and discussions.</p><p>A complete list of the videos is available on the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-ed/plugfest-1-2022/participants.html">list of participants</a>. Here are a few examples:</p><p>Plugfest #1 succeeded in familiarizing VC wallet vendors with an education data standard and education/workforce platforms with VCs. The participants were the first to issue &amp; display Open Badges 3.0 or for that matter any education standard as a VC. It revealed new questions about displaying credentials and what onboarding resources will be&nbsp;useful.</p><p>Each of the participating vendors that met the requirements will be awarded the Plugfest #1 badge (image pictured above). With this badge, they qualify to participate in Plugfest #2 which will focus on issuing and displaying LER VCs. Plugfest #2 will take place in November 2022 with plans to meet in person the day before the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop</a> on November 14 in Mountainview, CA. If vendors are interested in Plugfest #2 and didn’t participate in Plugfest #1, there is still an opportunity to do so by fulfilling the same requirements listed above including the video and earning a Plugfest #1&nbsp;badge.</p><p>To learn more, join VC-EDU which meets online most Mondays at 8 am PT/11 am ET/5 pm CET.

  <p>Summary:      The non-transferability of verifiable credential is one of their super powers. This post examines how that super power can be used to reduce fraud and increase safety in a hired car platform.</p>


<p>
    Bolt is a hired-car service like Uber or Lyft. Bolt is popular because its commissions are less than other ride-sharing platforms. In <a href="https://restofworld.org/2022/bolt-drivers-in-nigeria-are-illicitly-selling-their-accounts-putting-passengers-at-risk/">Bolt drivers in Nigeria are illicitly selling their accounts, putting passengers at risk</a> Rest of World reports on an investigation showing that Bolt drivers in Nigeria (and maybe other countries) routinely sell verified accounts to third parties. The results are just what you'd expect:
</p>
<blockquote>Adede Sonaike is another Lagos-based Bolt user since 2018, and said she gets frequently harassed and shouted at by its drivers over even the simplest of issues, such as asking to turn down the volume of the car stereo. Sonaike said these incidents have become more common and that she anticipates driver harassment on every Bolt trip. But on March 18, she told Rest of World she felt that her life was threatened. Sonaike had ordered a ride, and confirmed the vehicle and plate number before entering the car. After the trip started, she noticed that the driver’s face didn’t match the image on the app. “I asked him why the app showed me a different face, and he said Bolt blocked his account and that [he] was using his brother’s account, and asked why I was questioning him,” she recalled. She noticed the doors were locked and the interior door handle was broken, and became worried. Sonaike shared her ride location with her family and asked the driver to stop, so she could end the trip. He only dropped her off after she threatened to break his windows.
 From <a href="https://restofworld.org/2022/bolt-drivers-in-nigeria-are-illicitly-selling-their-accounts-putting-passengers-at-risk/">Bolt drivers in Nigeria are illicitly selling their accounts</a><br>Referenced 2022-06-09T09:44:24-0400
 </blockquote>

<p>
    The problem is accounts are easily transferable and reputations tied to transferable accounts can't be trusted since they don't reflect the actions of the person currently using the account. Making accounts non-transferable using traditional means is difficult because they're usually protected by something you know (e.g., a password) and that can be easily changed and exchanged. Even making the profile picture difficult to change (like Bolt apparently does) isn't a great solution since people may not check the picture, or fall for stories like the driver gave the passenger in the preceding quote.
</p>

<p>
    Verifiable credentials are a better solution because they're designed to not be transferable1. Suppose Bob wants to sell his Bolt account to Malfoy. Alice, a rider wants to know the driver is really the holder of the account. Bolt issued a verifiable credential (VC) to Bob when he signed up. The VC issuing and presenting protocols cryptographically combine an non-correlatable identifier and a link secret and use <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/11/zero_knowledge_proofs.shtml">zero-knowledge proofs</a> (ZKPs) to present the credential. ZKP-based credential presentations have a <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot9-prague/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/zkp-safety.md#technique-7-link-secret-bond">number of methods that can be used to prevent transferring the credential</a>. I won't go into the details, but the paper I link to provides eight techniques that can be used to prevent the transfer of a VC. We can be confident the VC was issued to the person presenting it. 
</p>

<p>
    Bolt could require that Bob use the VC they provided when he signed up to log into his account each time he starts driving. They could even link a bond or financial escrow to the VC to ensure it's not transferred. To prevent Bob from activating the account for Malfoy at the beginning of each driving period, Alice, and other passengers could ask drivers for proof that they're a legitimate Bolt driver by requesting a ZKP from the Bolt credential. Their Bolt app could do this automatically and even validate that the credential is from Bolt.
</p>

<p>
    Knowing that the credential was issued to the person presenting it is one of the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/10/fidelity_provenance_and_trust.shtml">four cryptographic cornerstones of credential fidelity</a>. The Bolt app can ensure the provenance of the credential Bob presents. Alice doesn't have trust Bob or know very much about Bob personally, just that he really is the driver that Bolt has certified.
</p>

<p>
    The non-transferability of verifiable credential is one of their super powers. A lot of the talk about identity in Web 3 has focused on NFTs. NFTs are, for the most part, designed to be transferable2. In that sense, they're no better than a password-protected account. Identity relies on knowing that the identifiers and attributes being presented are worthy of confidence and can be trusted. Otherwise, identity isn't reducing risk the way it should. That can't happen with transferable identifiers—whether their password-based accounts or even NFTs. There's no technological barrier to Bolt implementing this solution now...and they should for the safety of their customers. 
</p>

 Notes 

 
     I'm speaking of features specific to the Aries credential exchange protocol in this post. 
     Recently Vatalik el. al. proposed what they call a soul-bound token as a non-transferable credential type for Web3. I'm putting together my thoughts on that for a future post.

(Oxford Dictionary)</p><p>if two products, programs, etc. are interoperable, they can be used together. (Cambridge Dictionary)</p><p>It’s no surprise that digital versions of learning and employment records (LERs) like certifications, licenses, and diplomas can introduce new worlds of opportunity and perspective. If they are issued, delivered, and verified according to well-established and supported standards, computers are able to exchange and use this information securely and interoperably. This practice of technical interoperability could also precipitate an increase in systemic interoperability by providing more individuals with direct, convenient, understandable, and affordable access to their confirmable LERs that are syntactically, structurally, and semantically similar. This can make digital credentials useful across many different systems.</p><p>Interoperability of digital LERs has three primary&nbsp;aspects:</p>  Verification describes when the claims were made, who the credentials are from, who they are about, and provides methods to prove these identities and that the claim data have remained unchanged since issuance.  Delivery describes how the LERs move from one entity to another; overlaps with the verification layer.  Content describes what each claim is and is also referred to as the credential subject.  <p>Verification<br>At the Worldwide Web Consortium (W3C) there’s a standard called <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials (VC)</a> that describes how claims can be verified. It’s being used for claims that require unmitigated proof like government credentials, identity documents, supply chain management, and education credentials. A diploma issued as a VC by a university would contain content representing the diploma and would be digitally signed by the university. The identities of the university and the student could be represented by a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifier (DID</a>, also a recommendation developed at the W3C for cryptographically verifiable identities. The diploma could be stored in a digital wallet app where the student would have access to their cryptographically verifiable digital diploma at a moment’s notice. Verifiers, such as employers, who understand the VC and DID standards could verify the diploma efficiently without notifying the university. Digitally, this resembles how watermarked and notarized documents are handled&nbsp;offline.</p><p>Delivery<br>The connections between the wallet, the university credential issuing system, the student, and the verifier encompass the delivery of VCs. This overlaps with verification because DIDs and digital signature methods must be taken into consideration when the LERs are issued and transported. There are a handful of ways to accomplish this and several efforts aiming towards making this more interoperable including <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-api/">W3C CCG VC HTTP API</a> and <a href="https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/">DIF Presentation Exchange</a>.</p><p>Content<br>Verifiers can recognize that a VC is a diploma, certification, or a transcript because there are many semantic standards with vocabularies that describe learning and employment records like these. <a href="https://www.imsglobal.org/activity/digital-badges">Open Badges</a> and the <a href="https://www.imsglobal.org/activity/comprehensive-learner-record">Comprehensive Learner Record (CLR)</a> at <a href="https://www.1edtech.org/">1edtech</a> (formerly IMS Global) provide descriptions of credentials and the organizations that issue them. Both of these standards have been working towards upgrades (<a href="https://imsglobal.github.io/openbadges-specification/ob_v3p0.html">Open Badges 3.0</a> and CLR 2.0) to use the W3C Verifiable Credential model for verification. They provide a structural and semantic content layer that describes the claim as a type of achievement, the criteria met, and a potential profile of the&nbsp;issuer.</p><p>Another standard is the <a href="https://credentialengine.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/CTDL_Fact_Sheet.pdf">Credential Transparency Language (CTDL)</a> at <a href="https://credentialengine.org/">Credential Engine</a> which provides a more in-depth vocabulary to describe organizations, skills, jobs, and even pathways. When LER VCs contain CTDL content on its own or in addition to Open Badges or CLR, the rich data source can precisely describe who or what is involved in an LER providing additional context and taxonomy that can be aligned with opportunities.</p><p>Standards groups continue to seek ways to meet the needs of issuing services, wallet vendors, and verifying services that are coming to market. The <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/">Credentials Community Group (CCG)</a> is a great place to get acquainted with the community working on this. The W3C <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-ed/">Verifiable Credentials for Education Task Force (VC-EDU)</a> is a subgroup of the CCG that is exploring how to represent education, employment, and achievement verifiable credentials. This includes pursuing data model recommendations, usage guidelines, and best practices. Everyone at every stage of technology understanding is welcome to join in because we are all learning and every perspective increases understanding.

<p>I’ve been blogging since 1999, first at&nbsp;<a href="http://weblog.searls.com/">weblog.searls.com</a>, and since 2007 here. I also plan to continue blogging here* for the rest of my life. But it’s clear now that newsletters are where it’s at, so I’m going to start one of those.</p>
<p>The first question is, What do I call it?</p>
<p>The easy thing, and perhaps the most sensible, is Doc Searls Newsletter, or Doc Searls’ Newsletter, in keeping with the name of this blog. In branding circles, they call this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_line_extension">line extension</a>.</p>
<p>Another possibility is Spotted Hawk. This is inspired by Walt Whitman, who wrote,</p>
<blockquote><p>The spotted hawk swoops by and accuses me,<br>
he complains of my gab and my loitering.<br>
I too am not a bit tamed.<br>
I too am untranslatable.<br>
I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the same spirit I might call the newsletter&nbsp;Barbaric Yawp. But ya kinda gotta know the reference, which even English majors mostly don’t. Meanwhile, Spotted Hawk reads well, even if the meaning is a bit obscure.&nbsp;Hell, the Redskins or the Indians could have renamed themselves the Spotted Hawks.</p>
<p>Yet barbaric yawping isn’t my style, even if I am untamed and sometimes untranslatable.</p>
<p>Any other suggestions?</p>
<p>As a relevant but unrelated matter, I also have to decide how to produce it. The easy choice is to use Substack, which all but owns the newsletter platform space right now. But Substack newsletters default to tracking readers, and I don’t want that. I also hate paragraph-long substitutes for linked URLs, and&nbsp;tracking cruft appended to the ends of legible URLs. (When sharing links from newsletters, always strip that stuff off. Pro tip: the cruft usually starts with a question mark.) I’m tempted by <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/">Revue</a>, entirely because Julia Angwin and her team at <a href="https://themarkup.org/">The Markup</a> <a href="https://themarkup.org/newsletter/hello-world/hello-from-the-markup">went through a similar exercise</a> in 2019 and chose Revue for <a href="https://themarkup.org/newsletter/">their newsletter</a>. I’m already playing with that one. Other recommendations are welcome. Same goes for managing the mailing list if I don’t use a platform. <a href="http://www.list.org/">Mailman</a> perhaps?</p>
 
<p>*One reason I keep this blog up is that&nbsp;<a href="https://harvard.edu">Harvard</a>&nbsp;hosts it, and Harvard has been around since 1636. I also appreciate deeply its steady support of what I do here and at <a href="http://projectvrm.org">ProjectVRM</a>, which also manifests as a blog, at the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu">Berkman Klein Center</a>.</p>

<p>After almost 12 years, I’ve decided to close the <a href="https://forgerock.com">ForgeRock</a> chapter and leave the company.</p>



<p>Now that the company has successfully gone public, and has been set on a trajectory to lead the Identity industry, it was time for me to pause and think about what matters to me in life. So I’ve chosen to leverage the exciting experience I’ve gained with ForgeRock and to start giving back to the startups in my local community.</p>



<p>But what an incredible journey, it has been! I joined the company when it had a dozen employees, I was given the opportunity to found the French subsidiary, to start an engineering center, build an amazing team of developers and deliver some rock solid, highly scalable products. For this opportunity, I will always be thankful to the amazing 5 Founders of ForgeRock.</p>



<a href="https://ludopoitou.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/lp0_7414s.jpg"></a>The ForgeRock Founders: Hermann, Victor, Lasse, Steve, Jonathan.



<p>I have nothing but good memories of all those years, the amazing events organized for all the employees or for our customers. There has been many IdentityLive events (formerly known as Identity Summits), there has been fewer but so energizing Company Meetings, in Portugal, Greece, USA, Italy.</p>



<a href="https://ludopoitou.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/lp0_5652.jpg"></a>



<p>I’ve worked with a team of rock-star product managers, from which I’ve learnt so much:</p>



<a href="https://ludopoitou.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/froscars_awardwinners_007s.jpg"></a>



<p>I’ve hired and built a team of talented and software engineers, some of them I’ve known for 20 years:</p>



<a href="https://ludopoitou.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/2022-06-10_002_dsc_6666-copyright-bruno-lavit.jpg"></a>



<p>I don’t have enough space to write about all the different things we’ve done together, at work, outside work…  But yeah, we rocked!</p>



<a href="https://ludopoitou.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/photo-2022-06-17-21-50-49.jpg"></a>



<p>Overall those 12 years have been an incredible and exciting journey, but what made the journey so exceptional is all the persons that have come along. Without you, nothing would have been the same. Thank you ! Farewell but I’m sure we will meet again </p>

 Platform DAO. 
<p>Web searches don’t bring anything meaningful up, so I claim authorship on
this term.</p>
<p>Admittedly the amount of my inventiveness here is not very large.
<a href="https://platform.coop/people/trebor-scholz/">Trebor Scholz</a> coined
the term “Platform Cooperative” in an article in 2014 (according to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_cooperative#History_of_the_term">Wikipedia</a>).
He started with the long established term of a “cooperative”, and applied  it
to an organization that creates and maintains a software platform. So we
get a “Platform Co-op”.</p>
<p>I’m doing the exact same thing: a “Platform DAO” is a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization">Decentralized Autonomous Organization</a>,
a DAO, that creates and maintains a software platform. Given that DAOs
largely are the same as Co-ops, except that they use technology in order
to automate, and reduce the cost of some governance tasks – and also use
technology for better transparency – it seems appropriate to create that parallel.</p>
<p>Why is this term needed? This is where I think things get really interesting.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_cooperative">Platform co-op article</a>
on Wikipedia lists many reasons why platform co-ops could deliver much more
societal benefits than traditional vendor-owned tech platforms can. But it also
points out some core difficulties, which is why we haven’t seen too many successful
platform co-ops. At the top of which is the difficulty of securing early-stage capital.</p>
<p>Unlike in co-ops, venture investors these days definitely invest in DAOs.</p>
<p>Which means we might see the value of “Platform Co-ops” realized in their
form as “Platform DAOs” as venture investment would allow them to compete at
a much larger scale.</p>
<p>Imagine if today, somebody started Microsoft Windows. As a DAO. Where
users, and developers, and the entire VAR channel, are voting members of
the DAO. This DAO will be just as valuable as Microsoft – in fact I
would argue it would be more valuable than Microsoft –, with no
reason to believe it would deliver fewer features or quality, but lots of reasons to
believe that the ecosystem would rally around it in a way that it would
never rally around somebody else’s company.</p>
<p>Want to help? (No, I’m not building a Windows DAO. But a tech platform
DAO that could be on that scale.) Get in touch!</p>

  "We the people" have created a new living master; a bureaucratic machine, not "for, by, of" our control as people. This bureaucratic system, protected by a moat of credentialed labor certification processes and costs, is managed via plausible deniability practices now dominating the integrity of the civil systems which a civil society is managed by. Living people, now legal "people", function as assets under management and social liabilities leveraged for the development of budget expenditures not capable of self-administration by the people they exist to serve. This "<a href="https://www.moxytongue.com/2022/02/bureaucratic-supremacy.html">bureaucratic supremacy</a>" in governed process has rendered words meaningless in practice, and allowed a new Administrative King to rule the Sovereign territory where American self-governance was envisioned and Constituted, once upon a time. <br>  President after President, one precedent after another is used to validate actions that lack integrity under inspection. "Civil Rights Laws", suspended by bureaucratic supremacy alone, allow a President to nominate and hire a Supreme Court Justice on the stated basis of gender, skin color and qualifications. In lieu of a leader demonstrating what self-governance is capable of, "we the people" are rendered spectators of lifetime bureaucrats demonstrating their bureaucratic supremacy upon their "people".&nbsp;  <br>  Throw all the words away; democracy, republic, authoritarian dictatorship, gone. None matter, none convey meaningful distinctions.  <br>  You can either self-administer your role in a "civil society", or you can not. If you can not, it need not matter what you call your Government, or what form of "voting" is exercised. In the end, you are simply data. You are data under management, a demographic to be harvested. You will either be able to self-administer your participation, or you will ask for endless permission of your bureaucratic masters who fiddle with the meaning of those permissions endlessly. In this context, a bureaucratic process like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering">gerrymandering</a> is simply an exercise in bureaucratic fraud, always plausibly deniable.&nbsp;  <br>  Read all the history books you like; dead history is dead.  <br>  Self-administered governance of a civil society is the basis of the very existence of a "civil society" derived "of, by, for" people. People, Individuals All, living among one another, expressing the freedom of self-administration, is the only means by which a computationally accurate Constitution can exist. The imperfection of politics, driven by cult groupings of people practicing group loyalty for leverage in governed practices is itself a tool of leverage held exclusively by the bureaucracy. Self-administration of one's vote, held securely in an authenticated custodial relationship as an expression of one's authority in Government, is the means by which a Government derived "of, by, for" people comes into existence, and is sustained. Bureaucratic processes separating such people from the self-administration of their participation Constitutes a linguistic and legal ruse perpetrated upon people, Individuals all.  <br>  Plato, John Locke, Adam Smith... put down the books &amp; seminal ideas.  <br>  Self-Administration of human authority, possessed equally by all living Individuals who choose civil participation as a method of Governance derived "of, by, for" people, begins and ends with the structural accuracy of words, and their functional practices.&nbsp;  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>

in Austin. I hadn’t been to another, so I can’t easily compare this year with previous years.
But here are my impressions, in random order:

  <p>This past weekend I went to the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/consensus2022/">Consensus conference</a>
in Austin. I hadn’t been to another, so I can’t easily compare this year with previous years.
But here are my impressions, in random order:</p>
 
 
<p>The show was huge. Supposedly 20,000 in-person attendees. Just walking from one
presentation to another at the other end of the conference took a considerable amount
of time. And there were other locations distributed all over downtown Austin.</p>
 
 
<p>Lots and lots of trade show booths with lots of traffic.</p>
 
 
<p>In spite of “crypto winter”, companies still spent on the trade show booths. (But then,
maybe they committed to the expense before the recent price declines)</p>
 
 
<p>Pretty much all sessions were “talking heads on stage”. They were doing a good job
at putting many women on. But only “broadcast from the experts to the (dumb) audience”?
This feels out of touch in 2022, and particularly because web3/crypto is all supposed
to be giving everyday users agency, and a voice. Why not practice what you promote,
Consensus? Not even an official hash tag or back channel.</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Haugen">Frances Haugen</a> is impressive.</p>
 
 
<p>No theme emerged. I figured that there would be one, or a couple, of “hot topics” that
everybody talked about and would be excited about. Instead, I didn’t really see anything
that I hadn’t heard about for some years.</p>
 
 
<p>Some of the demos at some of the booths, and some of the related conversations were
surprisingly bad. Without naming names, for example, what would you expect if somebody’s
booth promises you some kind of “web3 authentication”? What I won’t expect is that the
demo consists of clicking on a button labeled “Log in with Google”, and when I
voiced surprise, handwaved about something with split keys, without being able to
explain, or show, it at all.</p>
 
 
<p>I really hate it if I ask “what does the product do?”", and the answer is “60,000 people
use it”. This kind of response is of course not specific to crypto, but either the
sales guy doesn’t actually know what the product does – which happens surprisingly
often – or simply doesn’t care at all the somebody asked a question. Why are you
going to trade shows again?</p>
 
 
<p>The refrain “it’s early days for crypto” is getting a bit old. Yes, other industries have
been around for longer, but one should be able to see a few compelling, deployed solutions for
real-world problems that are touching the real world outside of crypto. Many of
those that I heard people pitch were often some major distance away from being
realistic. For example, if somebody pitches tokenizing real estate, I would expect
them to talk about the value proposition for, say, realtors, how they are reaching them and
converting them, or how there is a new title insurance company based on blockchain
that is growing very rapidly because it can provide better title insurance at much lower cost.
Things like that. But no such conversation could be heard – well, at least not by me – and
that indicates to me that the people pitching this haven’t really really encountered the
market yet.</p>
 
 
<p>An anonymous crypto whale/investor – I think – who I chatted with over breakfast so much
confirmed this: he basically complained that so many pitches he’s getting are on
subjects that the entrepreneurs basically know nothing about. So real domain knowledge
is missing for too many projects. (Which would explain many things, including why so
many promising projects have run out of steam when it is time to actually deliver on the
lofty vision),</p>
 
 
<p>The crypto “market” still seems to mostly consist of a bunch of relatively young
people who have found a cool new technology, and are all in, but haven’t either felt
the need to, nor have been successful at applying it to the real world. I guess billions
of dollars of money flowing in crypto coins allowed them to ignore this so far.
I wonder whether this attitude can last in this “crypto winter”.</p>
 
 
<p>But this is also a great opportunity. While 90% of what has been pitched in web3/crypto
is probably crap and/or fraudulent (your number may be lower, or higher), it is not 100% and
some things are truly intriguing. My personal favorites are DAOs, which have turned into this
incredible laboratory for governance innovations. Given that we still vote – e.g. in the US –
in largely the same way as hundreds of years ago, innovation in democratic governance
has been glacial. All of a sudden we have groups that apply liquid democracy, and
quadratic voting, and weigh votes by contributions, and lots of other ideas. It’s like
somebody turned on the water in the desert, and instead of governance being all the same
sand as always, there are now flowers of a 1000 different kinds that you have never
seen before, blooming all over. (Of course many of those will not survive, as we don’t
know how to do governance differently, but the innovation is inspiring.)</p>
 
 
<p>In personal view, the potential of crypto technologies is largely all about governance.
The monetary uses should be considered a side effect of new forms of governance, not the
other way around. Of course, almost nobody – technologist or not – has many thoughts
on novel, better forms governance, because we have so been trained into believing that
“western style democracy” cannot be improved on. Clearly, that is not true, and there are
tons of spaces that need better governance than we have – my favorite pet peeve is
the rules about the trees on my street – so all innovations in governance are welcome.
If we could govern those trees better, perhaps we could also have a street fund to pay
for their maintenance – which would be a great example for a local wallet with a
“multisig”. Certainly it convinces me much more than some of the examples that I heard
about at Consensus.</p>
<p>I think the early days are ending. The crypto winter will have a bunch of projects die,
but the foundation has been laid for some new projects that could take over the world
overnight, by leading with governance of an undergoverned, high-value space. Now what
was your’s truly working on again? :-)</p>

<p>Marcus Smart. Photo by Eric Drost, via Wikimedia Commons.</p>
<p>Back in 2016, I correctly&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2016/06/19/why-the-cleveland-cavaliers-will-win-tonight/">predicted</a> that the Cleveland Cavaliers would win the NBA finals, beating the heavily favored Golden State Warriors, which had won <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NBA_teams_by_single_season_win_percentage">a record 73 games</a> in the regular season. In 2021, I incorrectly <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2021/02/07/chiefs/">predicted</a> that the Kansas City Chiefs would beat the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. I based both predictions on a theory: the best story would win. And maybe Tom Brady proved that anyway: a relative geezer who was by all measures the GOAT, proved that label.</p>
<p>So now I’m predicting that the Boston Celtics will win the championship because they will win because they have the better story.</p>
<p>Unless Steph Curry proves that he’s the GSOAT: Greatest Shooter Of All Time. Which he might. He sure looked like it in Game Four. That’s a great story too.</p>
<p>But I like the Celtics’ story better. Here we have a team of relative kids who were average at best by the middle of the season, but then, under their rookie coach, became a defensive juggernaut, racking up the best record through the remainder of the season, then blowing through three playoffs to get to the Finals. In Round One, they swept Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and the Brooklyn Nets, who were pre-season favorites to win the Eastern Conference. In Round Two, they beat Giannis Antentokuompo and the Milwaukee Bucks, who were defending champs, in six games. In Round Three, they won the conference championship by beating the Miami Heat, another great defensive team, and the one with the best record in the conference, in seven games. Now the Celtics are tied, 2-2, with the Western Conference champs, the Golden State Warriors, with Steph Curry playing his best, looking all but unbeatable, on a team playing defense that’s pretty much the equal of Boston’s.</p>
<p>Three games left, two at Golden State.</p>
<p>But I like the Celtics in this. They seem to have no problem winning on the road, and I think they want it more. And maybe even better.</p>
<p>May the best story win.</p>
<p>[Later…] Well, c’est le jeu. The Celtics lost the next two games, and the Warriors took the series.</p>
<p>After it was over, lots of great stories were told about the Warriors: the team peaked at the right time, they were brilliantly coached (especially on how to solve the Celtics), Steph moved up in all-time player rankings (maybe even into the top ten), Wiggins finally looked like the #1 draft choice he was years ago, the Dynasty is back. Long list, and it goes on. But the Celtics still had some fine stories of their own, especially around how they transformed from a mediocre team at mid-season to a proven title contender that came just two games away from winning it all. Not bad.</p>

<p>With more than 300 registered guests, an impeccable organisation by our Marketing team, the event was a great success.</p>

<p>The first day was sales oriented, with company presentations, roadmaps, products’ demonstrations but also testimony from existing customers. The second day was focusing on the technical side of the ForgeRock solutions, in an unconference format, where Product Managers, Technical Consultants et Engineers shared with the audience their experience, their knowledge.</p>

<p>Steps to implement </p>



  Create an authentication context in Azure for the tenant (using Microsoft Graph).  Add a CA policy which uses the authentication context.  Implement an authentication challenge using the claims challenge in the Blazor WASM.  



<p>Creating a conditional access authentication context</p>



<p>A continuous access (CA) authentication context was created using Microsoft Graph and a policy was created to use this. See the first <a href="https://damienbod.com/2022/04/20/implement-azure-ad-continuous-access-evaluation-in-an-asp-net-core-razor-page-app-using-a-web-api/">blog</a> in this series for details on setting this up.</p>







<p>Force MFA in the Blazor application</p>



<p>Now that the continuous access (CA) authentication context is setup and a policy is created requiring MFA, the application can check that the required acrs with the correct value is present in the id_token. We do this is two places, in the login of the account controller and in the OpenID Connect event sending the authorize request. The account controller Login method can be used to set the claims parameter with the required acrs value. By requesting this, the Azure AD policy auth context is forced. </p>


  [HttpGet("Login")]
public ActionResult Login(string? returnUrl, 
	string? claimsChallenge)
{
  // var claims = 
  //  "{\"access_token\":{\"acrs\":{\"essential\":true,\"value\":\"c1\"}}}";
  // var claims = 
  //  "{\"id_token\":{\"acrs\":{\"essential\":true,\"value\":\"c1\"}}}";
  var redirectUri = !string.IsNullOrEmpty(returnUrl) ? returnUrl : "/";

  var properties = new AuthenticationProperties { RedirectUri = redirectUri };

  if(claimsChallenge != null) 
  {
	string jsonString = claimsChallenge.Replace("\\", "")
		.Trim(new char[1] { '"' });

	properties.Items["claims"] = jsonString;
  }
  else
  {
	// lets force MFA using CAE for all sign in requests.
	properties.Items["claims"] 
	  = "{\"id_token\":{\"acrs\":{\"essential\":true,\"value\":\"c1\"}}}";
  }

  return Challenge(properties);
}
  


<p>In the application an ASP.NET Core authorization policy can be implemented to force the MFA. All requests require a claim type acrs with the value c1, which we created in the Azure tenant using Microsoft Graph.</p>


  services.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebAppAuthentication(configuration)
    .EnableTokenAcquisitionToCallDownstreamApi(initialScopes)
    .AddMicrosoftGraph("https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0", scopes)
    .AddInMemoryTokenCaches();

services.AddAuthorization(options =&gt;
{
    options.AddPolicy("ca-mfa", policy =&gt;
    {
        policy.RequireClaim("acrs", AuthContextId.C1);
    });
});
  


<p>By using the account controller login method, only the login request forces the auth context. If the context needs to be forced everywhere, then a middleware using the OnRedirectToIdentityProvider event can be used to add the extra request parameter on every OIDC authorize request. The OnRedirectToIdentityProvider event can be used to add this to all requests, which has not already added the claims parameter. You could also only use this without the login implementation in the account controller.</p>


  services.AddRazorPages().AddMvcOptions(options =&gt;
{
    var policy = new AuthorizationPolicyBuilder()
        .RequireAuthenticatedUser()
        .RequireClaim("acrs", AuthContextId.C1)
        .Build();
    options.Filters.Add(new AuthorizeFilter(policy));
}).AddMicrosoftIdentityUI();

services.Configure&lt;MicrosoftIdentityOptions&gt;(OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme, options =&gt;
{
    options.Events.OnRedirectToIdentityProvider = context =&gt;
    {
        if(!context.ProtocolMessage.Parameters.ContainsKey("claims"))
        {
            context.ProtocolMessage.SetParameter(
            "claims",
            "{\"id_token\":{\"acrs\":{\"essential\":true,\"value\":\"c1\"}}}");
        }

        return Task.FromResult(0);
    };
});
  


<p>Now all requests require the auth context which is used to require the CA MFA policy.</p>

<p>来る6月21日に、米国コロラド州デンバー近郊で行われるIdentiverse 2022で、「Identity in Conflict (紛争下のアイデンティティ）」と題するワークショップを行います。</p>



 <a href="https://identiverse.com/idv2022/session/910860/">Identity in Conflict</a> 



  Tuesday, June 21, 11:30 am – 12:20 pm MDT (日本時間 2:30 AM – 3:20 AM)   In times of instability and uncertainty, the reliability and trustworthiness of our identity systems become especially important. This workshop examines two areas in particular—identity management for displaced people, and the protection of government identity systems—and seeks to establish some ground rules to ensure that critical identity systems are robust and fit for purpose.  



<p>このセッションは、 去る2月24日に始まったウクライナ侵略をうけて、わたしが主催者に提案して実現したものです。すでに一杯であったプログラムに無理やり押し込んでくれた主催者には感謝しかありません。</p>



<p>紛争下のアイデンティティの課題には大きく分けて以下の２つがあります。</p>



  避難民のアイデンティティ管理&nbsp;  どのように彼らに援助やその他のサービス（銀行業務など）を提供するか  避難民と彼らを取り巻く人々への標的型誤情報から彼らをどう守るか    政府関連システムのアイデンティティ管理  敵の攻撃をいかにしのぎ政府や援助団体のシステムを守るか  事業継続・再生戦略    



<p>それぞれ、いくらでも語ることがあるトピックですが、残念ながら時間が50分しかありませんし、政府システム防衛を担当しておられる方が急遽渡米してこのセッションに加わっていただけることになったので、主に項目２について検討することになるかと思います。</p>



<p>今回の侵略が開始された後、ウクライナ政府に対するフィッシング等の攻撃は3000%の増加を見せています。これに対応するために、Yubico社が20,000個のYubikeyを送付するなど、各所からの援助が届いています。一方で、現在ウクライナ政府が使っている暗号アルゴリズムがGOST（ロシア版NIST）開発によるものであり、これと、ほとんどすべての政府システムが既にハッキングを受けたという某筋からの情報を合わせると、いろいろ考えさせられるところがあります。</p>



<p>Identiverseにお越しの折には、ぜひご参加ください。</p>

  <p>A long time ago, I read <a href="https://openlibrary.org/isbn/0060976519">The Language Instinct</a>.  Inside the back page of my book are notes with page numbers.  This is a practice I learned from a <a href="https://openlibrary.org/books/OL7563133M/World_Is_My_Home">book</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_A._Michener">James Michener</a>.  At some point, I started sharing in conversations something I learned.  Unfortunately, I had not made a note for this that I could check and the information was more complex than I remembered.  Since I had shared this more than once, I thought I should really find the reference and it was not easy but I found it on page 293.  The first part I had right.</p>

  <code>In sum, acquisition of a normal language is guaranteed for children up to the age of six, is steadily compromised from then until shortly after puberty, and is rare thereafter.
</code> 
 

<p>Here is the part I screwed up.</p>

  <code>We do know that the language-learning circuitry of the brain is more plastic in childhood; children learn or recover language when the left hemisphere of the brain is damaged or even surgically removed (though not quite at normal levels), but comparable damage in an adult usually leads to permanent aphasia.
</code> 
 

<p>While this itself is fascinating to me, I had been embellishing the story to say language is acquired in the brain’s right hemisphere in children and the left for adults.  Now that I’m rereading it after so many years, it is clear that the book says this can happen but is not necessarily so.</p>

			<p>The hoodoos of Bryce Canyon National Park. Photo made in the summer of 1987.

<p>Back in 1987, my mom and I went on a trip around the American Southwest. I was
18, freshly graduated from high school. We had reservations to ride donkeys down
into the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/grca/index.htm" title="Grand Canyon National Park">Grand Canyon</a>, but, sadly I got a flu and kept us in the hotel along
the rim.</p>
<p>The highlight of the trip turned out to be <a href="https://www.nps.gov/brca/index.htm" title="Bryce Canyon National Park">Bryce Canyon</a>, where I made this
photo of its famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoodoo_(geology)" title="Wikipedia: “Hoodoo (geology)”">hoodoos</a>. Likely shot with Kodachrome 64, my go-too for
sunny summer shots at the time, on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentax_ME_Super" title="Wikipedia: Pentax ME Super”">Pentax ME Super</a> SLR with, as I recall, a
28-105mm lens. Mom asked me yesterday if I’d scanned photos from that trip and,
digging into my scans, the deeply saturated colors with those lovely evergreens
took my breath away.</p>

This is exciting because it can be used to track the ownership of digital items. While NFTs are not without their problems, there is a growing appetite to explore the possibilities thanks to a culture that views the world in a fresh&nbsp;way.</p> ICOs <p>To understand the importance of NFTs, we need to understand the context of the world when NFTs were originally designed. In 2018, there was a lot of energy around exploring alternate currencies as a funding mechanism. The term ICO — or initial coin offering — was a method to raise funds for a new venture. But the vision of ICOs weren’t only to raise money, but to create a community with shared values. It’s similar to an IPO or Kickstarter, but with one key difference, the community had its own currency that could be used for transactions. Many of the ICO projects used a cryptocurrency as part of the product design — a financial mechanism to enable cooperation in a complementary financial system (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Lietaer">Bernard Lietaer</a>’s work on <a href="https://youtu.be/S_zPGhJJHF0?t=22">complementary currency systems</a>). But an ICO was equally a signaling of belief in the project and a desire to innovate existing economic&nbsp;models.</p><p>ICOs were problematic for many reasons, but one thing legit ICO creators wanted was the ability to issue a receipt or stock token to something to show that you are part of this community. This functionality was not possible with the existing transactional tokens. Different business models became available with a token that had a unique identity and ran on the same infrastructure as transactional tokens.</p><p>ICOs combined crowd-funding and cryptocurrency, and challenged economics as we knew it at the time. Not all ICOs succeeded, and there were scams. But ICOs are a successful innovation, making a funding mechanism that was previously only available to an elitist few, available more broadly. And it paved the way for NFTs which extend the transactional nature of tokens to enable unique identity while using the same ETH rails. These innovations enable new business&nbsp;models.</p> Artists and Ownership of&nbsp;Ideas <p>Artists are explorers pushing the boundaries of what we think technology can be used for and how it can be used. There are many challenges of being an artist. Not only do you have to successfully mine the well of creativity to create your art; you have to have some business acumen and be lucky to find success. Often the financial success of artists comes late in their career, and many die before they see the impact they’ve had on human&nbsp;society.</p><p>I was just commenting about this in the Mac Cosmetics store last week, when seeing Mac’s new <a href="https://www.maccosmetics.com/vivaglam">Keith Haring Viva Glam series</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Haring">Keith Haring</a> was a revolutionary artist that died of AIDS before he could even see the influence of his work. And <a href="https://www.heathervescent.com/novenify/">one of my first future scenarios</a> explored this idea, through <a href="https://www.heathervescent.com/heathervescent/2013/10/neux-for-you.html">an alternate currency created specifically so creators could pay for longevity treatments to live longer to see the impact of their&nbsp;lives</a>.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@dannylines?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Danny Lines</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a><p>But Artists can be jerks. There are countless stories of lesser talented but more well known artists, stealing ideas from unknown geniuses. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20180925-yayoi-kusamas-extraordinary-survival-story">Yayoi Kusama’s earliest ideas were stolen and utilized by Andy Warhol, Claes Oldenburg and Lucas Samaras, the results of which made them famous, while Kusama still struggled</a>. Seeing the success of her stolen ideas under a different name almost destroyed her. There was no way for her to prove creative provenance, especially when credit was not&nbsp;given.</p><p>Jodorosky’s Dune influenced the entire Sci-Fi industry, including the Star Wars, Alien and Blade Runner franchises. <a href="https://032c.com/magazine/alejandro-jodorowskys-dune-is-the-most-influential-movie-never-made">But none of this was known until relatively recently</a>.</p><p>Then there are artists like Banksy, who create art in public spaces, on brick walls and billboards. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/feb/17/banksy-la-oscars">I remember driving down La Brea in Los Angeles one morning in 2011 seeing the latest Banksy graffiti on a recent billboard, only to hear that the billboard owner took it down a few hours later– in order to capitalize on it!</a> In another case a concrete wall was removed because of the Banksy piece on&nbsp;it.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@nicolasjleclercq?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Nicolas J Leclercq</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a><p>This illustrates the problems of creative provenance and ownership. <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">Creative commons licenses</a> were created to provide a mechanism to license one’s work and allow others to use and remix it with attribution. But there aren’t good options for creators to protect against more powerful and better resourced people who can execute on their (borrowed or stolen)&nbsp;idea?</p><p>For artists who do sell their work, there is another conundrum. Artists only get paid on the first sale of their work, but their art can be sold at auctions later at an increased value. This makes art collectors in many ways investors, but the actual creator doesn’t get to benefit in the increased value after the art has left their hands. In some cases, the holder of the piece of art can make many millions more, than the actual creator of the piece. This use case inspired the creation of the <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2981">ERC-2981 Royalty</a> token, where artists can specify a royalty amount paid back to them, when the digital item is transferred.</p><p>Artists on one hand don’t always care about the ownership of ideas. On the other hand, you have to have money to live and keep making art. For anyone who has experienced someone take their ideas and execute on it, perhaps not even realizing it was not their own, is extremely painful. But the problem with ideas, if you want them to catch on, they have to become someone else’s. Unfortunately those with additional resources benefit when “borrowing” someone’s idea simply because they have the resources to execute on&nbsp;it.</p> Do NFTs give&nbsp;control? <p>NFTs sell the dream that artists can have control over what others can do with their creations. If you put an NFT on something to show provenance, that could help, but only if the laws around IP and ownership change too. Culture needs to change too. We’re all standing on the shoulders of the past, whether we acknowledge it or&nbsp;not.</p><p>We shouldn’t be surprised at the explosion of NFTs art — artists always use technology in novel ways that can be quite different from the use cases of the original creators. Traditional economic models haven’t supported creative efforts. And isn’t the point of artists to challenge the traditional ways we see the world? NFTs are an economic innovation that promises to give a tiny bit of power back to the&nbsp;artist.</p><p>I want to believe NFTs will help solve this problem, and I think they can partially address it. NFTs are a mechanism to give an artist more control and enable others to directly support them. But there is still the larger problem of living in a world that doesn’t often value creative expression in economic terms. And of those who have more power and resources utilizing the ideas of others for their own&nbsp;gain.</p>

<p>Quadratic equations examples</p>


  $$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}$$

$(a+b)^2$

$$\eqalign{
(a+b)^2 &amp;= (a+b)(a+b) \\
        &amp;= a^2 + ab + ba + b^2 \\
        &amp;= a^2 + 2ab + b^2
}$$

$(a-b)^2$

$$\eqalign{
(a-b)^2 &amp;= (a-b)(a-b) \\
        &amp;= a^2 - ab - ba + b^2 \\
        &amp;= a^2 - 2ab + b^2
}$$

$(a-b)(a+b)$

$$\eqalign{
(a+b)(a-b)  &amp;= a^2 - ab + ba - b^2 \\
        &amp;= a^2 - b^2
}$$

<p>Functions</p>


  $$ f(x) = {\sqrt{5x^2+2x-1}+(x-2)^2 } $$

$$ g(x) = {\\frac{a}{1-a^2} }$$

$$ f(x) = {(x + 2) \over (2x + 1)} $$   

$$ f(x) = { \sqrt[3]{x^2} }$$
  
$$ \sqrt[5]{34}$$
  


<p></p>







<p>Trigonometry examples</p>


  $$ cos^2 \theta + sin^2 \theta  = 1  $$

$$ tan 2 \theta = {2tan \theta  \over 1 - tan^2 \theta}  $$

$$\eqalign{
cos 2 \theta = cos^2 \theta - sin^2 \theta \\
                       &amp;=  2 cos^2  \theta -1 \\
                       &amp;= 1 - 2sin^2 \theta 
}$$

Prove $ \sqrt{ 1 - cos^2 \theta \over 1- sin^2 \theta} = tan \theta $

$$ \sqrt{ 1 - cos^2 \theta \over 1- sin^2 \theta} 
= \sqrt{ sin^2 \theta \over cos^2 \theta} 
= {sin \theta \over cos \theta} = Tan \theta 
$$

<p>Calculus examples</p>


  $$\eqalign{
f(x) = {3x^4} \implies {dy \over dx} = 12x^3
}$$

$$\eqalign{
f(x) = {2x^{-3/2}} \implies {dy \over dx} = -3x^{-5/2} &amp;= -{3 \over \sqrt{x^5}}
}$$

If $x = 2t + 1$ and $ y = t^2$ find ${dy \over dx}$ ?

$$\eqalign{
x = 2t + 1 \implies  {dx \over dt} = 2 \\
        y = t^2 \implies  {dy \over dt} = 2t \\
        {dy \over dx} = {dy \over dt} \div {dx \over dt} \\
         \implies 2t \div 2 = t
}$$

<p>Integration examples</p>


  Evaluate $\int_1^2 (x + 4)^2 dx $

$$\eqalign{
\int_1^2 (x + 4)^2 dx = \int_1^2 (x^2 + 8x + 16) dx \\
  &amp;= \left\lbrack {x^3 \over 3} + {8x^2 \over 2} + 16x \right\rbrack_1^2 \\
  &amp;= \left\lbrack {8 \over 3} + {8 * 4 \over 2} + 16 * 2 \right\rbrack 
   - \left\lbrack {1 \over 3} + {8 \over 2}  + 16  \right\rbrack 
}$$
  


<p></p>







<p>Matrix example</p>


  $$ {\left\lbrack \matrix{2 &amp; 3 \cr 4 &amp; 5} \right\rbrack} 
* \left\lbrack \matrix{1 &amp; 0 \cr 0 &amp; 1} \right\rbrack 
= \left\lbrack \matrix{2 &amp; 3 \cr 4 &amp; 5} \right\rbrack 
$$

<p>Early last month, the MEF held its first-ever event dedicated to personal data and identity event: <a>MEF CONNECTS Personal Data &amp; Identity Hybrid</a>, on May 10 and 11th, in London (watch all the videos <a>here</a>). It was unquestionably a huge success. Hundreds of people came together to learn, interact, and make an impact.</p>
 A Transformative Agenda 
<p>The event covered a wide range of strategic, tactical, and technical topics. In addition to recruiting the speakers and programming the event, I spoke on The Personal Data &amp; Identity Meeting of the Waters and introduced The Identity Nexus, an equation that illustrates the social and commercial personal data and identity equilibrium. Together we discussed:</p>
 
 Leading identification, authentication, and verification strategies 
 The pros and cons and comparisons of various biometrics methods, including FaceID and VeinID 
 People’s attitudes and sentiments at the nexus of personal data, identity, privacy and trust across 10-markets and U.S. undergraduate students 
 Passwordless authentication and approaches to self-sovereign identity and personal data management 
 Where personal data and identity meet physical and eCommerce retail, financial services, insurance, automotive, the U.S. military, and healthcare 
 The role of carriers and data brokers in improving the customer experience along the customer journey, identification, and combating fraud 
 Strategies for onboarding the over billion people today without an ID, let alone a digital ID. 
 The rise of the personal information economy and seven different approaches to empowering individuals to give them agency, autonomy, and control over their personal data and identity 
 Zero-party data strategies 
 Demonstrable strategies for securing IoT data traffic 
 Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG) investment personal data, and identity investment strategies 
 Emergent people-centric/human-centric business models 
 The rise of new regulations, including GDPR, CCPA, and new age-verification and age-gating regulations and the impact they’ll have on every business 
 Frameworks to help business leaders at every level figure out what to keep doing, start doing, or do differently

 We’re Just Getting Started and I’m Here for You 
<p>The global data market generates $11.7 trillion annually for the global economy. Industry experts forecast that efficient use of personal data and identity (not including the benefits of innovation, improving mental health and social systems, IoT interactions, banking and finance, road safety, reducing multi-trillion-dollar cybercrime losses, and more), can add one percent to thirteen percent of a country’s gross domestic product (GDP). And we’re just getting started. The personal data and identity tsunami is just now reaching and washing over the shores of every society and economy.

<p>For a friend’s memorial I signed up to make a batch of images into a slideshow. All I wanted was the Simplest Possible Thing: a web page that would cycle through a batch of images. It’s been a while since I did something like this, so I looked around and didn’t find anything that seemed simple enough. The recipes I found felt like overkill. Here’s all I wanted to do:</p>
 
 Put the images we’re gathering into a local folder
   Run one command to build slideshow.html
   Push the images plus slideshow.html to a web folder
  
<p>Step 1 turned out to be harder than expected because a bunch of the images I got are in Apple’s HEIC format, so I had to find a tool that would convert those to JPG. Sigh.</p>
<p>For step 2 I wrote the script below. A lot of similar recipes you’ll find for this kind of thing will create a trio of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. That feels to me like overkill for something as simple as this, I want as few moving parts as possible, so the Python script bundles everything into slideshow.html which is the only thing that needs to be uploaded (along with the images).</p>
<p>Step 3 was simple: I uploaded the JPGs and slideshow.html to a web folder.</p>
<p>Except, whoa, not so fast there, old-timer! True, it’s  easy for me, I’ve maintained a personal web server for decades and I don’t think twice about pushing files to it. Once upon a time, when you signed up with an ISP, that was a standard part of the deal: you’d get web hosting, and would use an FTP client — or some kind of ISP-provided web app — to move files to your server.</p>
<p>As I realized a few years ago, that’s now a rare experience. It seems that for most people, it’s far from obvious how to push a chunk of basic web stuff to a basic web server. People know how to upload stuff to Google Drive, or WordPress, but those are not vanilla web hosting environments. </p>
<p>It’s a weird situation. The basic web platform has never been more approachable. Browsers have converged nicely on the core standards. Lots of people could write a simple app like this one. Many more could at least /use/ it. But I suspect it will be easier for many nowadays to install Python and run this script than to push its output to a web server.</p>
<p>I hate to sound like a Grumpy Old Fart. Nobody likes that guy. I don’t want to be that guy. So I’ll just ask: What am I missing here? Are there reasons why it’s no longer important or useful for most people to be able to use the most basic kind of web hosting?</p>

But I hope you get something out of it too! 
</p>

<p>
    I <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2002/05/">started blogging in May 2002</a>, twenty years ago today. I'd been thinking about blogging for about a year before that, but hadn't found the right tool. <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/">Jon Udell</a>, who I didn't know then, mentioned his blog in an InfoWorld column. He was using <a href="http://scripting.com/">Dave Winer's</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_UserLand">Radio Userland</a>, so I downloaded it and started writing. At the time I was CIO for the State of Utah, so I garnered a bit of noteriety as a C-level blogger. And I had plenty of things to blog about. 
</p>

<p>
    Later, I <a href="https://www.windley.com/essays/2005/moving_to_movabletype">moved to MovableType</a> and then, like many developers who blog, <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2013/04/a_new_look_leads_to_a_new_blogging_system.shtml">wrote my own blogging system</a>. I was tired of the complexity of blogging platforms that required a database. I didn't want the hassle. I write the body of each post using Emacs using custom macros I created. Then my blogging system generates pages from the bodies using a collection of templates. I use <code>rsync</code> to push them up to my server on AWS. Simple, fast, and completely under my control.
</p>

<p>
    Along the way, I've influenced my family to blog. My wife, Lynne, built a blog to <a href="http://lynne.windley.org/blog/">document her study abroad to Europe in 2019</a>. My son Bradford has a <a href="https://bradfordwindley.com/">blog where he publishes short stories</a>. My daughter Alli is a <a href="https://longbournfarm.com/">food blogger and entrepreneur</a> with a large following.  My daughter Samantha is an illustrator and <a href="http://samanthawindley.com/">keeps her portfolio on her blog</a>.
</p>

<p>
    <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/">Doc Searls</a>, another good friend who I met through blogging, says you can make money from your blog or because of it. I'm definately in the latter camp. Because I write for me, I don't want to do the things necessary to grow an audience and make my blog pay. But my life and bank account are richer because I blog. Jon, Dave, and Doc are just a few of countless friends I've made blogging. I wouldn't have written <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596008783/windleyofente-20">my first book</a> if <a href="https://dougkaye.com/">Doug Kaye</a>, another blogging friend, hadn't suggested it. I wouldn't have started <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop</a> or been the Executive Producer of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729200341id_/http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/">IT Conversations</a>.  I <a href="https://www.windley.com/tags/startup.shtml">documented the process of creating</a> my second startup, <a href="https://www.windley.com/tags/kynetx.shtml">Kynetx</a> on my blog. And, of course, I've written a bit (402 posts so far, almost 10% of the total) on <a href="https://www.windley.com/tags/identity.shtml">identity</a>. I've been invited to speak, write, consult, and travel because of what I write. 
</p>

<p>
    After 20 years, blogging has become a way of life. I think about things to write all the time. I can't imagine not blogging. Obviously, I recommend it. You'll become a better writer if you blog regularly. And you'll better understand what you write about. Get a domain name so you can move it, because you will, and you don't want to lose what you've written. You may not build a brand, but you'll build yourself and that's the ultimate reward for blogging.

<p>This post shows how to force an Azure AD policy using Azure AD Continuous Access (CA) in an ASP.NET Core Blazor application. An authentication context is used to require MFA. The “acrs” claim in the id_token is used to validate whether or not an Azure AD CAE policy has been fulfilled. If the claim is missing, an OpenID Connect challenge is sent to the Azure AD identity provider to request and require this. In this sample, MFA is required.</p>

<p>Steps to implement </p>



  Create an authentication context in Azure for the tenant (using Microsoft Graph)  Add a CA policy which uses the authentication context.  Implement the Blazor backend to handle the CA validation correctly  Implement an authentication challenge using the claims challenge in the Blazor WASM  



<p>Setup overview</p>



<p>A Blazor WASM application is implemented and hosted in an ASP.NET Core application. This is one single application, or also know as a server rendered application. The single application is secured using a single confidential client and the security is implemented in the trusted backend with no sensitive token data stored in the browser. Cookies are used to store the sensitive data. Microsoft.Identity.Web is used to implement the security. The Microsoft.Identity.Web lib is an OpenID Connect client wrapper from Microsoft with some Microsoft Azure specifics. </p>







<p>Creating a conditional access authentication context</p>



<p>A continuous access evaluation (CAE) authentication context was created using Microsoft Graph and a policy was created to use this. See the first <a href="https://damienbod.com/2022/04/20/implement-azure-ad-continuous-access-evaluation-in-an-asp-net-core-razor-page-app-using-a-web-api/">blog</a> in this series for details on setting this up.</p>









<p>Validate the CAE in the Blazor backend</p>



<p>The CaeClaimsChallengeService class is used to implement the CAE check in the application. The class checks for the acrs claim and returns a claims challenge requesting the claim if this is missing.</p>


  namespace BlazorBffAzureAD.Server;

/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Claims challenges, claims requests, and client capabilities
/// 
/// https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/claims-challenge
/// 
/// Applications that use enhanced security features like Continuous Access Evaluation (CAE) 
/// and Conditional Access authentication context must be prepared to handle claims challenges.
/// 
/// This class is only required if using a standalone AuthContext check
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
public class CaeClaimsChallengeService
{
    private readonly IConfiguration _configuration;

    public CaeClaimsChallengeService(IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        _configuration = configuration;
    }

    public string? CheckForRequiredAuthContextIdToken(string authContextId, HttpContext context)
    {
        if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(authContextId))
        {
            string authenticationContextClassReferencesClaim = "acrs";

            if (context == null || context.User == null || context.User.Claims == null || !context.User.Claims.Any())
            {
                throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(context), "No Usercontext is available to pick claims from");
            }

            var acrsClaim = context.User.FindAll(authenticationContextClassReferencesClaim).FirstOrDefault(x =&gt; x.Value == authContextId);

            if (acrsClaim?.Value != authContextId)
            {
                string clientId = _configuration.GetSection("AzureAd").GetSection("ClientId").Value;
                var cae = "{\"id_token\":{\"acrs\":{\"essential\":true,\"value\":\"" + authContextId + "\"}}}";

                return cae;
            }
        }

        return null;
    }
}
  


<p>The AdminApiCallsController is used to provide data for the Blazor WASM UI. If the identity does not have the required authorization, an unauthorized response is returned to the UI with the claims challenge.</p>


  using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

namespace BlazorBffAzureAD.Server.Controllers;

[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
[Authorize(AuthenticationSchemes = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)]
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class AdminApiCallsController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly CaeClaimsChallengeService _caeClaimsChallengeService;

    public AdminApiCallsController(CaeClaimsChallengeService caeClaimsChallengeService)
    {
        _caeClaimsChallengeService = caeClaimsChallengeService;
    }

    [HttpGet]
    public IActionResult Get()
    {
        // if CAE claim missing in id token, the required claims challenge is returned
        var claimsChallenge = _caeClaimsChallengeService
            .CheckForRequiredAuthContextIdToken(AuthContextId.C1, HttpContext);

        if (claimsChallenge != null)
        {
            return Unauthorized(claimsChallenge);
        }

        return Ok(new List&lt;string&gt;()
        {
            "Admin data 1",
            "Admin data 2"
        });
    }
}
  


<p></p>



<p>Handling the authentication challenge in the Blazor WASM client</p>



<p>The Blazor WASM client handles the unauthorized response by authenticating again using Azure AD. If the claims challenge is returned, a step up authentication is sent to Azure AD with the challenge. The CaeStepUp  method is used to implement the UI part of this flow.</p>


  using System.Net;

namespace BlazorBffAzureAD.Client.Services;

// orig src https://github.com/berhir/BlazorWebAssemblyCookieAuth
public class AuthorizedHandler : DelegatingHandler
{
    private readonly HostAuthenticationStateProvider _authenticationStateProvider;

    public AuthorizedHandler(HostAuthenticationStateProvider authenticationStateProvider)
    {
        _authenticationStateProvider = authenticationStateProvider;
    }

    protected override async Task&lt;HttpResponseMessage&gt; SendAsync(
        HttpRequestMessage request,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        var authState = await _authenticationStateProvider.GetAuthenticationStateAsync();
        HttpResponseMessage responseMessage;
        if (authState.User.Identity!= null &amp;&amp; !authState.User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
        {
            // if user is not authenticated, immediately set response status to 401 Unauthorized
            responseMessage = new HttpResponseMessage(HttpStatusCode.Unauthorized);
        }
        else
        {
            responseMessage = await base.SendAsync(request, cancellationToken);
        }

        if (responseMessage.StatusCode == HttpStatusCode.Unauthorized)
        {
            var content = await responseMessage.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();

            // if server returned 401 Unauthorized, redirect to login page
            if (content != null &amp;&amp; content.Contains("acr")) // CAE
            {
                _authenticationStateProvider.CaeStepUp(content);
            }
            else // standard
            {
                _authenticationStateProvider.SignIn();
            }
        }

        return responseMessage;
    }
}

  


<p>The CaeStepUp navigates to the authorization URL of the backend application with the claims challenge passed as a parameter.</p>


  public void CaeStepUp(string claimsChallenge, 
	string? customReturnUrl = null)
{
	var returnUrl = customReturnUrl != null ?
		_navigation.ToAbsoluteUri(customReturnUrl).ToString() : null;
		
	var encodedReturnUrl = Uri.EscapeDataString(returnUrl ?? _navigation.Uri);

<p>The Login checks for claims challenge and starts an authentication process using Azure AD and the Microsoft.Identity.Web client.</p>

        var redirectUri = !string.IsNullOrEmpty(returnUrl) ? returnUrl : "/";

        var properties = new AuthenticationProperties { RedirectUri = redirectUri };

        if(claimsChallenge != null)
        {
            string jsonString = claimsChallenge.Replace("\\", "")
                .Trim(new char[1] { '"' });

            properties.Items["claims"] = jsonString;

<p>Requests for tokenomics consulting have been bombarding me lately. My theory is that it’s because almost everyone recognizes that nothing any tokenomics expert has told them makes any sense. Quite a few clients have reported that all the tokenomics experts tell them it’s about the marketing and the burn rate and they, as founders, can’t understand where the real value&nbsp;it.</p><p>In other words, tokenomics seems to be complete baloney to many founders. And they’re not wrong. In this post I’m going to go into three considerations in constructing your tokenomics model and how each one should affect the model. I won’t go into any fancy mathematical formulae, just the basic&nbsp;logic.</p><p>The three considerations, in order of importance are:</p>  The founders’ goals and&nbsp;desires.  What “the market/ investors” will invest&nbsp;in.  Sustainable and logical tokenomics that move the project&nbsp;forward.  <p>Just separating these three out is a revelation for many founders. It may be completely possible to raise a lot of funds on a model that is completely at odds with the sustainability of the project. It’s equally easy to raise a lot of money and have a successful company and not accomplish any of your personal goals. Many entrepreneurs go into business thinking that once they succeed, they’ll have more money and time for the things they really want to do. How’s that working&nbsp;out?</p> What do you REALLY&nbsp;want? <p>Issuing a token seems to be a fast way to big money, and there’s also some stuff about freedom and democracy, so blockchain naturally attracts a huge crowd. Let’s assume that you do raise the money you want for your&nbsp;project.</p><p>What do you really want as a&nbsp;founder?</p>  To create a successful long-term business that contributes value to the&nbsp;world?  To expand or get a better valuation for an existing&nbsp;company?  To build a better form of democracy?  To build cool tech&nbsp;stuff?  To rescue the rain&nbsp;forests?  To prove yourself in the blockchain industry so you’ll have a future&nbsp;career?  To have enough money to buy an island and&nbsp;retire?  To provide a way for poor people to make a living in&nbsp;crypto?  To get rich and show everyone they were wrong about how crypto is a&nbsp;bubble?  To get out of the existing rat race before the economy completely collapses?  To save others from the collapse by getting everyone a bitcoin wallet and a few satoshis?  <p>Usually you and the other founders will have a combination of personal goals, commitments to your family, values that you want to promote, and excitement about a particular project.</p><p>The tokenomics should align with your goals. Generally speaking:</p>  There are serious legal implications and potential repercussions to raising money through a token launch. If you have an existing, profitable business, you do have something to lose by getting it wrapped up in&nbsp;crypto.  Projects do need money and pretending you have a good tokenomics model can get you&nbsp;there.  If you have an idea for a blockchain project, chances are 98% that someone else has already done something similar. Ask yourself honestly why you aren’t just joining them. If you think you can do it better, ask yourself why you don’t just help them be better. Do your research to understand the challenges they are facing, because you are about to face&nbsp;them.  If your main inspiration is building a great business or getting career experience, joining a project that already raised money might get you there&nbsp;faster.  If you are doing a “social good” project, monetary incentives will corrupt the&nbsp;project.  If you love DeFi, yield farming, and all that stuff, and just want to make money, you probably will do better working hard and investing in the right projects rather than taking the legal and personal risks involved in your own&nbsp;token.  <p>Personally, my core reason for writing whitepapers and consulting in Web3 is because I love helping people accomplish their goals. I’ve been working with entrepreneurs for 30 years, and nothing beats the satisfaction of watching people accomplish their&nbsp;dreams.</p> Investors, what’s an investor? <p>The second consideration is what the “investors” will perceive as a good tokenomics model. If you’ve gotten this far, you’ve already decided to raise money through a token sale. The only way to do that is to create tokenomics that investors will&nbsp;love.</p>  It does not matter if the tokenomics model makes&nbsp;sense.  It does not matter if the tokenomics model works in practice.  It does not matter if the tokenomics model works in&nbsp;theory.  <p>All of those models of burn rate and stuff do not matter for the purposes of selling your token EXCEPT that they need to align with what the investor-de-jour thinks the calculation-du-jour should be. All of those charts and models are pure poppycock. With rare exception, none of the people who are modelling are central bankers, monetary theory experts, mathematicians or data scientists. If they were, they would either tell you it doesn’t work or that it’s speculative and unproven, or they would create something that would never pass your legal&nbsp;team.</p><p>The good news is that you don’t have to understand tokenomics or make something sensible to create a useful tokenomics model. You just have to copy the thing-du-jour and have good marketing.</p><p>After all, these people aren’t really investors, are they? They are going to dump your coin as soon as they can. They aren’t going to use the token for the “ecosystem”. They aren’t going to advise or critique you on anything beyond the token price. They are in for the quick profits. Your job is to figure out how to pump the coin for as long as possible and do whatever it was you planned in step one (what you want) with the money you raised. Nobody is being fooled around here. Let’s not pretend that there was actually some project you wanted to do with the money. If there was, also fine, and you just keep doing that with the funds raised, and if it succeeds, that’s a bonus, but it doesn’t matter to these “investors”. They weren’t hodling for the long&nbsp;term.</p><p>If you have real investors who are in it for the long term, BTW, you might be coming to me to write a whitepaper for you, but you wouldn’t be reading my advice on tokenomics. You’ve probably got those people on board&nbsp;already.</p><p>To summarize, in today’s market, what you are trying to create is a speculative deflationary model that you can market for as long as possible. This is not sustainable for the actual product, as I’ll cover in the next&nbsp;section.</p> What would actually&nbsp;work? <p>As far as I can tell based on my experience working with more than 300 project, there is no empirical evidence that any of the tokenomics models work, other than Security Tokens where you really give investors equity in the&nbsp;project.</p><p>Token models are not designed to give the token holders profit. So far, all of the cryptocurrency market is based on speculation. You can potentially to argue that Bitcoin and a few other coins are really useful as a store and exchange of value, but it is too late to invent Bitcoin&nbsp;again.</p><p>Let me clarify that, because it’s not customary for a tokenomics expert to say “none of the token models work,” so let me discuss Ethereum as one of the best possible outcomes but which also triggers a failure&nbsp;mode.</p><p>Ethereum is one of the very few cryptocurrencies that works as advertised in the whitepaper: it is used as the utility token on the Ethereum network. It’s also a great investment, because it has generally gone up in value. So it “works” as advertised, but the failure mode is that it’s gotten too damn expensive. Yes, it rose in value, which is great for investors. But using the Ethereum network is prohibitively expensive. The best thing to do with ETH is hodl, not utilize. For your project, think of the following models:</p>  You create the BeanCoin which allows the holder to get a bushel of beans for 1 coin. You are successful and the BeanCoin is now worth $500, but nobody wants to spend $500 to for a bushel of beans. Investors are happy but the coin is&nbsp;useless.  You create the PollCoin, a governance token that allows the holder to vote for community proposals and elections. You are successful and the PollCoin is worth $500 and now it costs a minimum of $500 to become a citizen of the community and $2500 to submit a proposal to the community. The best companies/people to do the work don’t want to submit a proposal because the risk is too high of losing that money. Anyone who bought in early to PollCoin sells because they would rather have money than a vote in a community of elitist rich people with poor execution because nobody wants to submit proposals to do&nbsp;work.  <p>In other words, when you create a deflationary coin or token, by default, the success of the token is also it’s&nbsp;failure.</p><p>But what about Pay-to-Earn models? Haven’t they been a success? How about DAOs where the community does the&nbsp;work?</p><p>First of all, any project younger than 3 years old can’t be considered as a model for long-term tokenomics success. The best we can say is “good so far”. Secondly, nobody has ever been able to explain to me how “giving away money” is a potential long-term business&nbsp;model.</p> A token for&nbsp;everyone <p>A surprising number of people who contact me have not thought deeply about what they want on a six-month, two-year, or ten-year scale when they launch these projects. Many people think a token is an easy way to raise money, which it is, relative to many other ways of raising money. But keep in mind that every step you take in your entrepreneurial journey is just a step closer to the next, usually bigger, problem. As you launch your token, make sure to check in with yourself and your other founders that you’re ready for the next challenge down the&nbsp;pike.</p>

<p>This article shows how to implement Azure AD Continuous Access (CA) in a Blazor application which uses a Web API. The API requires an Azure AD conditional access authentication context. In the example code, MFA is required to use the external API. If a user requests data from the API using the required access token without the required acr claim, an unauthorized response is returned with the missing claims. The Blazor application returns the claims challenge to the WASM application and the application authenticates again with the step up claims challenge. If the user has authenticated using MFA, the authentication is successful and the data from the API can be retrieved.</p>

<p>Steps to implement </p>



  Create an authentication context in Azure for the tenant (using Microsoft Graph).  Add a CA policy which uses the authentication context.  Implement the CA Azure AD authentication context authorization in the API.  Implement the Blazor backend to handle the CA unauthorized responses correctly.  Implement an authentication challenge using the claims challenge in the Blazor WASM.  



<p>Setup overview</p>







<p></p>



<p>Creating a Conditional access Authentication Context</p>



<p>A continuous access (CA) authentication context was created using Microsoft Graph and a policy was created to use this. See the previous <a href="https://damienbod.com/2022/04/20/implement-azure-ad-continuous-access-evaluation-in-an-asp-net-core-razor-page-app-using-a-web-api/">blog</a> for details on setting this up.</p>









<p></p>



<p>External API setup</p>



<p>The external API is setup to validate Azure AD JWT Bearer access tokens and to validate that the required continuous access evaluation (CAE) policy is fulfilled. The CAE policy uses the authentication context required for this API. If the user is authorized, the correct claims need to be presented in the access token.</p>


  [Authorize(Policy = "ValidateAccessTokenPolicy", 
AuthenticationSchemes = JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)]
[ApiController]
[Route("[controller]")]
public class ApiForUserDataController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly CAEClaimsChallengeService _caeClaimsChallengeService;

    public ApiForUserDataController(
		CAEClaimsChallengeService caeClaimsChallengeService)
    {
        _caeClaimsChallengeService = caeClaimsChallengeService;
    }

    [HttpGet]
    public IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; Get()
    {
        // returns unauthorized exception with WWW-Authenticate header 
        // if CAE claim missing in access token
        // handled in the caller client exception with challenge returned 
        // if not ok
        _caeClaimsChallengeService
			.CheckForRequiredAuthContext(AuthContextId.C1, HttpContext);
		
        return new List&lt;string&gt; 
		{ 
			"admin API CAE protected data 1", 
			"admin API CAE protected data 2" 
		};
    }
}
  


<p>The CaeClaimsChallengeService class implements the CAE requirement to use the API. If the user access token has insufficient claims, an unauthorized response is returned to the application requesting data from the API. The WWW-Authenticate header is set with the correct data as defined in the OpenID Connect signals and events specification.</p>

<p>Using Continuous Access Evaluation (CAE) in an ASP.NET Core hosted Blazor application.</p>



<p>The Blazor application is authenticated using MSAL and the backend for frontend (BFF) architecture. The Blazor application administrator page uses data from the CAE protected API. The Blazor ASP.NET Core hosted WASM application is protected using a MSAL confidential client.</p>


  services.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebAppAuthentication(

	.AddMicrosoftGraph(
		Configuration.GetSection("GraphBeta"))
	.AddDistributedTokenCaches();
  


<p>The AdminApiClientService class is used to request data from the external API. The http client uses an Azure AD user delegated access token. If the API returns an unauthorized response, a WebApiMsalUiRequiredException is created with the WWW-Authenticate header payload.</p>


  public class AdminApiClientService
{
    private readonly IHttpClientFactory _clientFactory;
    private readonly ITokenAcquisition _tokenAcquisition;

        client.BaseAddress = new Uri("https://localhost:44395");
        client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization

        throw new WebApiMsalUiRequiredException(
			$"Unexpected status code in the HttpResponseMessage: {response.StatusCode}.", response);
    }
}
  


<p>The AdminApiCallsController implements the API used by the Blazor WASM client. This is protected using cookies. The controller would return an unauthorized response with the claims challenge, if the WebApiMsalUiRequiredException is thrown.</p>


  public class AdminApiCallsController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly AdminApiClientService _userApiClientService;
   
    public AdminApiCallsController(
		AdminApiClientService userApiClientService)
    {
        _userApiClientService = userApiClientService;
    }

    [HttpGet]
    public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; Get()
    {
        try
        {
            return Ok(await _userApiClientService.GetApiDataAsync());
        }
        catch (WebApiMsalUiRequiredException hex)
        {
            var claimChallenge = WwwAuthenticateParameters
				.GetClaimChallengeFromResponseHeaders(hex.Headers);
            return Unauthorized(claimChallenge);
        }
    }
}
  


<p>In the Blazor WASM client, an AuthorizedHandler is implemented to handle the unauthorized response from the API. If the “acr” claim is returned, the CAE step method is called.</p>


  public class AuthorizedHandler : DelegatingHandler
{
    private readonly HostAuthenticationStateProvider _authenticationStateProvider;

    public AuthorizedHandler(
		HostAuthenticationStateProvider authenticationStateProvider)
    {
        _authenticationStateProvider = authenticationStateProvider;
    }

    protected override async Task&lt;HttpResponseMessage&gt; SendAsync(
        HttpRequestMessage request,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        var authState = await _authenticationStateProvider
			.GetAuthenticationStateAsync();
        HttpResponseMessage responseMessage;
        if (authState.User.Identity!= null &amp;&amp; 
			!authState.User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
        {
            // if user is not authenticated, 
			// immediately set response status to 401 Unauthorized
            responseMessage = new HttpResponseMessage(
				HttpStatusCode.Unauthorized);
        }
        else
        {
            responseMessage = await base.SendAsync(
				request, cancellationToken);
        }

        if (responseMessage.StatusCode == HttpStatusCode.Unauthorized)
        {
            var content = await responseMessage.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();

            // if server returned 401 Unauthorized, redirect to login page
            if (content != null &amp;&amp; content.Contains("acr")) // CAE
            {
                _authenticationStateProvider.CaeStepUp(content);
            }
            else // standard
            {
                _authenticationStateProvider.SignIn();
            }
        }

        return responseMessage;
    }
}
  


<p>The CaeStepUp method is implemented in the Blazor WASM client and creates a claims challenge with the defined claims challenge and the URL of the WASM client page for the redirect.</p>


  public void CaeStepUp(string claimsChallenge, string? customReturnUrl = null)
{
	var returnUrl = customReturnUrl != null 
		? _navigation.ToAbsoluteUri(customReturnUrl).ToString() : null;
		
	var encodedReturnUrl = 
		Uri.EscapeDataString(returnUrl ?? _navigation.Uri);
	var logInUrl = _navigation.ToAbsoluteUri(
		$"{LogInPath}?claimsChallenge={claimsChallenge}&amp;returnUrl={encodedReturnUrl}");
		
	_navigation.NavigateTo(logInUrl.ToString(), true);
}
  


<p>The account login sends a challenge to Azure AD to request the claims for the CAE. </p>


  [HttpGet("Login")]
public ActionResult Login(string? returnUrl, string? claimsChallenge)
{
	//var claims = "{\"access_token\":{\"acrs\":{\"essential\":true,\"value\":\"c1\"}}}";
	var redirectUri = !string.IsNullOrEmpty(returnUrl) ? returnUrl : "/";

	var properties = new AuthenticationProperties { RedirectUri = redirectUri };

	if(claimsChallenge != null)
	{
		string jsonString = claimsChallenge.Replace("\\", "")
			.Trim(new char[1] { '"' });

		properties.Items["claims"] = jsonString;
	}

	return Challenge(properties);
}
  


<p>The Microsoft.Identity.Web client package requires the cp1 ClientCapabilities.</p>


  "AzureAd": {
 "Instance": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/",
 "Domain": "[Enter the domain of your tenant, e.g. contoso.onmicrosoft.com]",

<p>Yours truly, in a <a href="https://justatheory.com/2018/02/genius/">2018 review</a> of <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/genius-the-life-and-science-of-richard-feynman/9780679747048">Genius</a>, by James Gleick:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because our ways of understanding the universe are not the universe itself.
They’re explanatory tools we develop, use, and sometimes discard in favor of
newer, more effective tools. They’re imperfect, products of their times and
cultures. But sometimes, in the face of an intractable problem, a maverick
mind, cognizant of this reality, will take the radical step of discarding some
part of the prevailing doctrine in an attempt to simplify the problem, or just
to see what might happen. Feynman was such a mind, as Gleick shows again and
again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In case you’re wondering why I’m linking to my own blog, while this piece dates
from 2018, I posted it only a few weeks ago. Originally I posted it on
Goodreads, but when <a href="https://justatheory.com/2022/03/goodreads-ato/" title="How Goodreads Deleted My Account">Goodreads unceremoniously deleted my account</a> I thought it
was gone for good. But two months later, Goodreads <a href="https://justatheory.com/2022/03/goodreads-ato/#update">sent me my content</a>. I was
back in business! With my data recovered and added to my <a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/itheory">StoryGraph
profile</a>, I also took the opportunity to post the one review I had put some
effort into on my own site. So here were are.</p>
<p>In other words, I’m more likely to post book reviews on Just a Theory from here
on, but meanwhile, I’d be happy to be your friend <a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/itheory">on StoryGraph</a>.</p>

    <br><p>I participated in a fantastic talk in May 2022 on “Ideological Polarization and Extremism in the 21st Century” led by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-leader-maynard-05955b83/">Jonathan Leader Maynard</a> who is a Lecturer in International Politics at King's College London.&nbsp; The purpose here focuses on a though I took from Jonathan's talk and his new book, “Ideology and Mass Killing: The Radicalized Security Politics of Genocides and Deadly Atrocities,” published by Oxford University Press.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When I started thinking about writing about Peak Paradox, it was driven by a desire to answer a core question I asked myself, individuals, boards and teams; “what are we/ you optimising for?” .&nbsp; It has become my go-to question when I want to explore the complexity of decision making and team dynamics as the timeframe (tactical vs strategic) is determined by the person answering the question. Ultimately individuals in a team, which give the team its capabilities, are driven by different purposes and ideals, which means incentives work differently as each person optimises for different things in different ways in different time frames.</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathalieoestmann/">Nathalie Oestmann</a> put up this <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/embed/feed/update/urn:li:share:6929331217532121088">post</a> with the diagram below, talking about communication and all having the same message.&nbsp; My comment was that if you want stability this is good thinking, if you need change it will be less so as it will build resistance. &nbsp; If you want everyone to have the same message then again this is helpful thinking, but, if you need innovation alignment is less useful.&nbsp; When we all optimise for one thing and do the same thing - what do we become?&nbsp; A simple view is that 91 lines in the final idea becomes one as we will perpetuate the same, building higher walls with&nbsp; confimative incentives, feedback loops and echo chambers to ensure that the same is defensible.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>What we become, when we optimise for one thing was also set out by Jonathan in his talk. He effectively said (to me) that if you optimise for one thing, you are an extremist.&nbsp; You have opted that this one thing is (or very few things are) more important than anything else. &nbsp; We might *not* like to think of ourselves as extremists but it is in fact what we are when we optimise for a single goal.&nbsp; Natalie’s post confirms that if you have enough people optimizing, for one thing, you have a tribe, movement, power, and voice.&nbsp; The very action of limiting optimisation from many to single creates bias and framing.&nbsp;</p><p>Extremism can be seen as a single optimisation when using Peak Paradox&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/williamwgeorge/">Bill George</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/williamwgeorge_how-emotionally-intelligent-people-use-the-activity-6927643913071591424--Jqv">wrote supporting</a> the 24-hour rule from this <a href="https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/how-emotionally-intelligent-people-use-24-hour-rule-to-maximize-success-overcome-failure.html">INC article</a>, essentially, whatever happens, is good or bad, you have 24 hours to celebrate or stew. Tomorrow, it’s a new day. It’s a good way to stay focused on the present.&nbsp; The problem is that this optimising appears good at one level but to improve leadership decision making and judgement skills, moving on without much stewing or celebrating removes critical learning. Knowing when to use the 24-hour is perfect, to blanket apply is probably a less useful rule. Leadership needs to focus on tomorrow's issues based on yesterday's learning whilst ensuring surviving today, to get to tomorrow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>So much about what we love (embrase/ take one/ follow) boils ideas down to a single optimisation. Diets, games, books, movies, etc..&nbsp; Is it that we find living with complexity and optimising for more than one thing difficult or exhausting, or that one thing is so easy that we given our energy retention preference there is a natural bias to simplification? Religion and faith, politics, science, maths, friends family and life in general however requires us to optimise for opposing ideas all the same time, creating tensions and compromises.&nbsp;</p><p>Implication to boards, leadership and management</p><p>For way-to-long, the mantra for the purpose of a business was to “maximise the wealth for the shareholders.”&nbsp; This was the singular objective and optimisation of the board and instruction to management “maximise profits.” &nbsp; We have come a little way since then, but as I have written before, the single purity of Jenson and Mecking's work in 1976 left a legacy of incentives and education to optimise for one thing ignoring other thinking such as Peter Drucker’s 1973 insight that the only valid purpose of a firm is to create a customer, which itself has problems.&nbsp;</p><p>We have shifted to “optimsing for stakeholders” but is that really a shift on the peak paradox framework or a dumbing down of one purpose, one idea, one vision?&nbsp; A movement from the simple and singular to a nuanced paradoxical mess?&nbsp; Yes it is a move from the purity of “shareholder primacy” but does it really engage in optimising for the other peaks on the map?&nbsp; What does become evident is that when we move from the purity of maximising shareholder value is that decision making becomes more complex.&nbsp; I am not convinced that optimising for all stakeholders really embraces the requirement for the optimising for sustainability, it is a washed out north star where we are likely to deliver neither.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Here is the issue for the leadership.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Optimising for one thing is about being extreme.&nbsp; When we realise we are being extreme it is not a comfortable place to be and it naturally drives out creativity, innovation and change.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The pandemic made us focus on one issue, and it showed us that when we, irrespective of industry, geography and resources had to focus on just one thing we can make the amazing happen.&nbsp; Often sited is the 10 years of progress in 10 months, especially in digital and changing work patterns.&nbsp; However, we did not consider the tensions, compromises or unintended consequences, we just acted.&nbsp; Doing one thing, and being able to do just one thing is extreme.&nbsp;</p><p>Extreme is at edges of the peak paradox model.&nbsp; When we move from optimising for one thing to a few things we struggle to determine which is the priority. This is the journey from the the edges to the centre of the peak paradox model.&nbsp; When we have to optimise for many things we are at Peak Paradox. We know that optimising for many trends is tiring and the volume of data/ information we need for decision making increases by the square of the number of factors you want to optimise for. &nbsp; It is here that we find complexity but also realise that we cannot optimise or drive for anything.&nbsp; Whilst living with complexity is a critical skill for senior teams, it is here that we find that we cannot optimise and we appear to a ship adrift in a storm being pulled everywhere, with no direction or clarity of purpose.&nbsp; A true skill of great leadership is about knowing what to optimise for &amp; when. Given the ebbs and flows of a market, there is a time to dwell and live with complexity optimising for many but knowing when to draw out, provide clarity, and optimise for one thing is critical.&nbsp;</p><p>The questions we are left to reflect on are:</p>  <p>how far from a single optimisation do your skills enable you to move?</p>  <p>how far from a single optimisation do your team's collective skills enable you to collectively move?</p>  <p>when optimising for conflicting purposes, how do you make decisions?</p>  <p>when optimising for conflicting purposes, how does the team make collective decisions?</p>  <p>When we finally master finding clarity to optimise for one thing and equally living with the tensions, conflicts and compromises of optimising for many things; we move from average to outperforming in terms of delivery and from decision making to judgment.&nbsp;</p><p>Great leaders and teams appear to be able to exist equally in the optimisation for both singular and complex purposes at the same time.</p><p>This viewpoint suggests that when the optimisation is for a singular focus, such as a three-word mission and purpose statement that provides a perfect clarity of purpose, is actually only half the capability that modern leadership needs to demonstrate. </p> <br>

<p>Chemistry is a good metaphor for how teams work—especially when times get tough, such as in the playoffs happening in the NBA right now.</p>
<p>Think about it. Every element has <a href="https://periodictable.com/Properties/A/MeltingPoint.an.html">a melting point</a>: a temperature&nbsp;above which solid turns liquid. Basketball teams do too, only that temperature changes from game to game, opponent to opponent, and situation to situation. Every team is a collection of its own human compounds of many elements: physical skills and talents, conditioning, experience, communication skills, emotional and mental states, beliefs, and much else.</p>
<p>Sometimes one team comes in pre-melted, with no chance of winning. Bad teams start with a low melting point, arriving in liquid form and spilling all over the floor under heat and pressure from better teams.</p>
<p>Sometimes both teams might as well be throwing water balloons at the hoop.</p>
<p>Sometimes both teams are great, neither melts, and you get an overtime outcome that’s whatever the score said when the time finally ran out. Still, one loser and one winner. After all, every game has a loser, and half the league loses every round. Whole conferences and leagues average .500. That’s their melting point: half solid, half liquid.</p>
<p>Yesterday we saw two meltdowns, neither of which was expected and one of which was a complete surprise.</p>
<p>First, the Milwaukee Bucks melted under the defensive and scoring pressures of the Boston Celtics. There was nothing shameful about it, though. The Celtics just ran away with the game. It happens. Still, you could see the moment the melting started. It was near the end of the first half. The Celtics’ offense sucked, yet they were still close. Then they made a drive to lead going into halftime. After that, it became increasingly and obviously futile to expect the Bucks to rally, especially when it was clear that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giannis_Antetokounmpo">Giannis Antetokounmpo</a>, the best player in the world, was clearly less solid than usual. The team melted around him while the Celtics rained down threes.</p>
<p>To be fair, the Celtics also melted three times in the series, most dramatically at the end of game five, on their home floor. But Marcus Smart, who was humiliated by a block and a steal in the closing seconds of a game the Celtics had led almost all the way, didn’t melt. In the next two games, he was more solid than ever. So was the team. And they won—this round, at least. Against the Miami Heat? We’ll see.</p>
<p>Right after that game, the&nbsp;Phoenix Suns, by far the best team in the league through the regular season, didn’t so much play the Dallas Mavericks as submit to them. Utterly.</p>
<p>In chemical terms, the Suns showed up in liquid form and turned straight into gas. As Arizona Sports <a href="https://arizonasports.com/story/3143053/bickley-suns-humiliating-game-7-loss-is-one-of-greatest-collapses-in-history/">put it</a>, “We just witnessed one of the greatest collapses in the history of the NBA.” No shit. Epic. Nobody on the team will ever live this one down. It’s on their permanent record. Straight A’s through the season, then a big red F.</p>
<p>Talk about losses: a mountain of bets on the Suns also turned to vapor yesterday.</p>
<p>So, what happened?&nbsp;I say chemistry.</p>
<p>Maybe it was nothing more than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don%C4%8Di%C4%87">Luka Dončić </a>catching fire and vaporizing the whole Suns team. Whatever, it was awful to watch, especially for Suns fans. Hell, they melted too. Booing your team when it needs your support couldn’t have helped, understandable though it was.</p>
<p>Applying the basketball-as-chemistry theory, I expect the Celtics to go all the way. They may melt a bit in a game or few, but they’re more hardened than the Heat, which comes from having defeated two teams—the Atlanta Hawks and the Philadelphia 76ers—with relatively low melting points. And I think both the Mavs and the Warriors have lower melting points than either the Celtics or the Heat.</p>
<p>But we’ll see.</p>
<p>Through the final two rounds, look at each game as a chemistry experiment. See how well the theory works.</p>

  <p>Summary:      Allowing groups to self-organize, set their own agendas, and decide without central guidance or planning requires being vulnerable and trusting. But the results are worth the risk.</p>




<p>
    Last month was the 34th <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com">Internet Identity Workshop</a> (IIW). After doing the last four virtually, it was spectacular to be back together with everyone at the Computer History Museum. You could almost feel the excitement in the air as people met with old friends and made new ones. Rich the barista was back, along with Burrito Wednesday. I loved watching people in small groups having intense conversations over meals, drinks, and snacks. 
</p>

<p>
    Also back was IIW's trademark <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology">open space organization</a>. Open space conferences are workshops that don't have pre-built agendas. Open space is like an unconference with a formal facilitator trained in using open space technology. IIW is self-organizing, with participants setting the agenda every morning before we start. IIW has used open space for part or all of the workshop since the second workshop in 2006. Early on, <a href="https://identitywoman.net">Kaliya Young</a>, one of my co-founders (along with <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/">Doc Searls</a>), convinced me to try open space as a way of letting participants shape the agenda and direction. For an event this large (300-400 participants), you need professional facilitation. <a href="https://www.heidinobantu.com">Heidi Saul</a> has been doing that for us for years. The results speak for themselves. IIW has nurtured many of the ideas, protocols, and trends that make up modern identity systems and thinking.

<p>
    Last month was the first in-person CTO Breakfast since early 2020. CTO Breakfast is a monthly gathering of technologists in the Provo-Salt Lake City area that I've convened for almost 20 years. Like IIW, CTO Breakfast has no pre-planned agenda. The discussion is freewheeling and active. We have just two rules: (1) no politics and (2) one conversation at a time. Topics from the last meeting included LoRaWAN, Helium network, IoT, hiring entry-level software developers, Carrier-Grade NATs, and commercial real estate. The conversation goes where it goes, but is always interesting and worthwhile.
</p>

<p>
    When we built the University API at BYU, we used decentralized decision making to make key architecture, governance, and implementation decisions. Rather than a few architects deciding everything, we had many meetings, with dozens of people in each, over the course of a year hammering out the design.
</p>

<p>
    What all of these have in common is decentralized decision making by a group of people that results in learning, consensus, and, if all goes well, action. The conversation at IIW, CTO Breakfast, and BYU isn't the result a few smart people deciding what the group needed to hear and then arranging meetings to push it at them. Instead, the group decides. Empowering the group to make decisions about the very nature and direction of the conversation requires trust and trust always implies vulnerability. But I've become convinced that it's really the best way to achieve real consensus and make progress in heterogeneous groups. Thanks Kaliya!

<p>This article shows how to use multiple Azure B2C user flows from a single ASP.NET Core application. Microsoft.Identity.Web is used to implement the authentication in the client. This is not so easy to implement with multiple schemes as the user flow policy is used in most client URLs and the Microsoft.Identity.Web package overrides an lot of the default settings. I solved this by implementing an account controller to handle the Azure B2C signup user flow initial request and set the Azure B2C policy. It can be useful to split the user flows in the client application, if the user of the application needs to be guided better.</p>



<p>Code <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/azureb2c-fed-azuread">https://github.com/damienbod/azureb2c-fed-azuread</a></p>



<p>The Azure B2C user flows can be implemented as simple user flows. I used a signup flow and a signin, signup flow.</p>







<p>The AddMicrosoftIdentityWebAppAuthentication is used to implement a standard Azure B2C client. There is no need to implement a second scheme and override the default settings of the Microsoft.Identity.Web client because we use a controller to select the flow.</p>


  string[]? initialScopes = Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;(
	"UserApiOne:ScopeForAccessToken")?.Split(' ');

services.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebAppAuthentication(Configuration, "AzureAdB2C")
	.EnableTokenAcquisitionToCallDownstreamApi(initialScopes)
	.AddInMemoryTokenCaches();

services.Configure&lt;MicrosoftIdentityOptions&gt;(
	OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme, options =&gt;
{
	options.Events.OnTokenValidated = async context =&gt;
	{
		if (ApplicationServices != null &amp;&amp; context.Principal != null)
		{
			using var scope = ApplicationServices.CreateScope();
			context.Principal = await scope.ServiceProvider
				.GetRequiredService&lt;MsGraphClaimsTransformation&gt;()
				.TransformAsync(context.Principal);
		}
	};
});
  


<p>The AzureAdB2C app settings configures the sign in, sign up flow. The SignUpSignInPolicyId setting is used to configure the default user flow policy. </p>


  "AzureAdB2C": {
    "Instance": "https://b2cdamienbod.b2clogin.com",
    "ClientId": "8cbb1bd3-c190-42d7-b44e-42b20499a8a1",
    "Domain": "b2cdamienbod.onmicrosoft.com",
    "SignUpSignInPolicyId": "B2C_1_signup_signin",
    "TenantId": "f611d805-cf72-446f-9a7f-68f2746e4724",
    "CallbackPath": "/signin-oidc",
    "SignedOutCallbackPath ": "/signout-callback-oidc",
    // "ClientSecret": "--use-secrets--"
},
  


<p>The AccountSignUpController is used to set the policy of the flow we would like to use. The SignUpPolicy method just challenges the  Azure B2C OpenID Connect server with the correct policy.</p>


  using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

namespace Microsoft.Identity.Web.UI.Areas.MicrosoftIdentity.Controllers;

[AllowAnonymous]
[Route("MicrosoftIdentity/[controller]/[action]")]
public class AccountSignUpController : Controller
{
    [HttpGet("{scheme?}")]
    public IActionResult SignUpPolicy(
        [FromRoute] string scheme,
        [FromQuery] string redirectUri)
    {
        scheme ??= OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
        string redirect;
        if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(redirectUri) &amp;&amp; Url.IsLocalUrl(redirectUri))
        {
            redirect = redirectUri;
        }
        else
        {
            redirect = Url.Content("~/")!;
        }

        scheme ??= OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;

        var properties = new AuthenticationProperties 
           { RedirectUri = redirect };
        properties.Items[Constants.Policy] = "B2C_1_signup";
        return Challenge(properties, scheme);
    }
}
  


<p>The Razor page opens a link to the new controller and challenges the OIDC server with the correct policy.</p>


  &lt;li class="nav-item"&gt;
	&lt;a class="nav-link text-dark" 
href="/MicrosoftIdentity/AccountSignUp/SignUpPolicy"&gt;Sign Up&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  


<p>With this approach, an ASP.NET Core application can be extended with multiple user flows and the UI can be improved for the end user as required.</p>

All of Dave’s presentations are carefully researched and presented. A detail that has long fascinated me: how the show displays source material. Dave often cites IPCC reports and other sources that are, in raw form, PDF files. He spices up these citations with some impressive animated renderings. Here’s one from the most recent episode.</p>
  
<p>
The progressive rendering of the chart in this example is an even fancier effect than I’ve seen before, and it prompted me to track down the original source. In that clip Dave cites IRENA, the International Renewable Energy Agency, so I visited their site, looked for the cited report, and found it on page 8 of <a href="https://www.irena.org/-/media/Files/IRENA/Agency/Publication/2022/Mar/IRENA_WETO_Summary_2022.pdf#page8">World Energy Transitions Outlook 2022</a>. That link might or might not take you there directly, if not you can scroll to page 8 where you’ll find the chart that’s been animated in the video.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
The graphical finesse of Just Have a Think is only icing on the cake. The show reports a constant stream of innovations that collectively give me hope we might accomplish the transition and avoid worst-case scenarios. But still, I wonder. That’s just a pie chart in a PDF file. How did it become the progressive rendering that appears in the video? </p>
<p>
In any case, and much more importantly: Dave, thanks for the great work you’re doing!</p>

<p>I did a lot of shooting recently with a rented&nbsp;<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Sony+FE+70-200mm+F2.8+GM+OSS+II">Sony FE 70-200mm F2.8 GM OSS II</a> lens, mounted on my 2013-vintage <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/sony-alpha-a7r">Sony a7r</a> camera. One result was the hummingbird above, which you’ll find among the collections&nbsp;<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/albums/72177720298312531">here</a> and <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/albums/72177720298581254">here</a>. Also, here’s a toddler…</p>
<p></p>
<p>…and a grandma (right after she starred as the oldest alumnus at a high school reunion I where I took hundreds of other shots):</p>
<p></p>
<p>This lens is new, sharp, versatile, earns good reviews (e.g. <a href="https://kenrockwell.com/sony/lenses/70-200mm-f28-ii.htm">here</a>) and is so loved already that it’s hard to get, despite the price: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Full-Frame-Constant-Aperture-telephoto-SEL70200GM2/dp/B09JCMLP46/">more than $3k</a> after taxes. And, though it’s very compact and light (2.3 lbs) for what it is and does, the thing is big:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Full-Frame-Constant-Aperture-telephoto-SEL70200GM2/dp/B09JCMLP46/"></a></p>
<p>So I ordered <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Full-Frame-Constant-Aperture-telephoto-SEL70200GM2/dp/B09JCMLP46/">one</a>, which Amazon won’t charge me for before it ships, on May 23, for delivery on the 24th.</p>
<p>But I’m having second, third, and fourth thoughts, which I just decided to share here.</p>
<p>First, I’m not a fine art photographer. I’m an amateur who mostly shoots people and subjects that interest me, such as <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/infrastructure">what I can see out airplane windows</a>, or choose to document for my own odd purposes—such as <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/infrastructure">archiving photos of broadcast towers and antennas</a>, most of which will fall out of use over the next two decades, after being obsolesced by the Internet, wi-fi and 5G.</p>
<p>All the photos I publish are Creative Commons licensed to encourage use by others, which is why <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?search=doc+searls&amp;title=Special:MediaSearch&amp;go=Go&amp;type=image">more than 1600 of them have found their way into Wikimedia Commons</a>. Some multiple of those accompany entries in Wikipedia. <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Montifringilla_nivalis_-Swiss_Alps-8.jpg">This one</a>, for example, is in 9 different Wikipedia entries in various languages:</p>
<p><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Montifringilla_nivalis_-Swiss_Alps-8.jpg"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/52614599@N00/4225995286">Here is the original</a>, shot with a tiny Canon pocket camera I pulled from the pocket of my ski jacket.</p>
<p>In other words, maybe I’ll be better off with a versatile all-in-one camera that will do much of what this giant zoom does, plus much more.</p>
<p>After much online research, I’ve kind of settled on considering the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dpreview.com/search/?query=sony%20cyber&amp;product=sony_dscrx10iv">Sony Cyber-shot DSC-RX10 IV</a>. It has a smaller sensor than I’d like, but it is exceptionally versatile and gets great reviews. While my Sony a7r with its <a href="https://www.kenrockwell.com/sony/lenses/24-105mm-f4.htm">outstanding</a>&nbsp;24-105mm f/4 FE G OSS lens is versatile as well, and light for a full-frame DSLR, I really need a long lens for a lot of the stuff I shoot. And I suspect this “bridge” camera will do the job.</p>
<p>So here is the choice:</p>
 
 Leave the order stand, and pay $3k for a fully fabulous 70-200 zoom that I’m sure to love but will be too big to haul around in many of the settings where I’ll be shooting. 
 Cancel that order, and instead pay half that for the DSC-RX10 IV—and get it in time for my trip to Hawaii next week. 
 
<p>[Later…] I decided to let the order stand. Two reasons. First, I’ve shot a couple thousand photos so far with the 70-200 zoom, and find it a near-flawless instrument that I enjoy playing. One reason I do is that it’s as close to uncompromising as a lens can be—especially a zoom, which by design involves many compromises. Second, I’ve never played with the&nbsp;DSC-RX10 IV, and that’s kind of a prerequisite. I also know that one of its compromises I won’t be able to overcome is the size of its sensor. I know megapixels are a bit of a head trip, but they do matter, and 36.4 Mpx vs 20.1 “effective” Mpx is non-trivial.</p>
<p>Additionally, I may choose in the long run to also get an <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/sony-a7-iv-review#CC">a7iv</a>&nbsp;camera, so my two lenses will have two bodies. We’ll see.</p>

Companies can experience growing pains and backlash due to incomplete thinking prior to implementation. Attackers do the hard work of finding every crack and vulnerability. Activists point out civil liberty and social biases. This shows how our current solutions are not always secure or equitable. In the end, each criminal, activist, and product misstep inspires innovation and new solutions.</p>  The benefit of biometrics is they are unique and can be trusted to be unique. It’s not impossible, but it is very hard for someone to spoof a biometric. Using a biometric raises the bar a bit, and makes that system less attractive to target — up to a&nbsp;point.  Any data is only as secure as the system in which it is stored. Sometimes these systems can be easily penetrated due to poor identity and access management protocols. This has nothing to do with the security of biometrics — that has to do with the security of stored&nbsp;data.  Apple FaceID is unbelievably convenient! Once I set up FaceID to unlock my phone, I can configure it to unlock other apps — like banking apps. Rather than typing in or selecting my password from a password manager — I just look at my phone! This makes it easy for me to access my sensitive data. From a user experience perspective, this is wonderful, but I have to trust Apple’s locked down tech&nbsp;stack.  The first versions of new technologies will still have issues. All new technology is antifragile, and thus will have more bugs. As the technology is used, the bugs are discovered (thanks hackers!) and fixed, and the system becomes more secure over time. Attackers will move on to more vulnerable targets.  Solve for every corner case and you’ll have a rigid yet secure system that probably doesn’t consider the human interface very well. Leave out a corner case and you might be leaving an open door for attack. Solving for the “right” situation is a balance. Which means, either extreme can be harmful to different audiences.  Learn from others, share and collaborate on what you have learned. Everyone has to work together to move the industry&nbsp;forward.  <p>Curious to learn more insights about the Future of Digital Identity? I’ll be joining three speakers on the <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/women-in-identity-virtual-meetup-2022-hosted-by-capital-one-registration-324921407677">Future of Digital Identity Verification panel</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Cameron_(computer_scientist)"></a></p>
<p>When digital identity ceases to be a pain in the ass, we can thank Kim Cameron and his <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/stories/2005/05/13/TheLawsOfIdentity.pdf">Seven Laws of Identity</a>, which he wrote in 2004, formally published in early 2005, and gently explained and put to use until he <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2021/12/03/remembering-kim-cameron/">died</a> late last year. Today, seven of us will take turns explaining each of Kim’s laws at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/">KuppingerCole</a>‘s <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2022/agenda">EIC</a> conference in Berlin. We’ll only have a few minutes each, however, so I’d like to visit the subject in a bit more depth here.</p>
<p>To understand why these laws are so important and effective, it will help to know where Kim was coming from in the first place. It wasn’t just his work as the top architect for identity at Microsoft (to which he arrived when his company was acquired). Specifically, Kim was coming from two places. One was the physical world where we live and breathe, and identity is inherently personal. The other was the digital world where what we call identity is how we are known to databases. Kim believed the former should guide the latter, and that nothing like that had happened yet, but that we could and should work for it.</p>
<p>Kim’s <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/stories/2005/05/13/TheLawsOfIdentity.pdf">The Laws of Identity</a> paper alone is close to seven thousand words, and his <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/">IdentityBlog</a> adds many thousands more. But his laws by themselves are short and sweet. Here they are, with additional commentary by me, in italics.</p>
<p>1. User Control and Consent</p>
<p>Technical identity systems must only reveal information identifying a user with the user’s consent.</p>
<p>Note that consent goes in the opposite direction from all the consent “agreements” websites and services want us to click on. This matches the way identity works in the natural world, where each of us not only chooses how we wish to be known, but usually with an understanding about how that information might be used.</p>
<p>2. Minimun Disclosure for a Constrained Use</p>
<p>The solution which discloses the least amount of identifying information and best limits its use is the most stable long term solution.</p>
<p>There is a reason we don’t walk down the street wearing name badges: because the world doesn’t need to know any more about us than we wish to disclose. Even when we pay with a credit card, the other party really doesn’t need (or want) to know the name on the card. It’s just not something they need to know.</p>
<p>3. Justifiable Parties</p>
<p>Digital identity systems must be designed so the disclosure of identifying information is limited to parties having a necessary and justifiable place in a given identity relationship.</p>
<p>If this law applied way back when Kim wrote it, we wouldn’t have the massive privacy losses that have become the norm, with unwanted tracking pretty much everywhere online—and increasingly offline as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Directed Identity</p>
<p>A universal identity system must support both “omni-directional” identifiers for use by public entities and “unidirectional” identifiers for use by private entities, thus facilitating discovery while preventing unnecessary release of correlation handles.</p>
<p>All brands, meaning all names of public entities, are “omni-directional.” They are also what Kim calls “beacons” that have the opposite of something to hide about who they are. Individuals, however, are private first, and public only to the degrees they wish to be in different circumstances. Each of the first three laws are “unidirectional.”</p>
<p>5. Pluralism of Operators and Technologies</p>
<p>A universal identity system must channel and enable the inter-working of multiple identity technologies run by multiple identity providers.</p>
<p>This law expresses learnings from Microsoft’s failed experiment with Passport and a project called “Hailstorm.” The idea with both was for Microsoft to become the primary or sole online identity provider for everyone. Kim’s work at Microsoft was all about making the company one among many working in the same broad industry.</p>
<p>6. Human Integration</p>
<p>The universal identity metasystem must define the human user to be a component of the distributed system integrated through unambiguous human-machine communication mechanisms offering protection against identity attacks.</p>
<p>As Kim put it in <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2019_14_09_cameron">his 2019 (and final) talk at EIC</a>, we need to turn the Web “right side up,” meaning putting the individual at the top rather than the bottom, with each of us in charge of our lives online, in distributed homes of our own. That’s what will integrate all the systems we deal with. (Joe Andrieu first explained this in 2007, <a href="https://blog.joeandrieu.com/2007/06/14/vrm-the-user-as-point-of-integration/">here</a>.)</p>
<p>7. Consistent Experience Across Contexts</p>
<p>The unifying identity metasystem must guarantee its users a simple, consistent experience while enabling separation of contexts through multiple operators and technologies.</p>
<p>So identity isn’t just about corporate systems getting along with each other. It’s about <a href="https://dsearls.medium.com/customers-need-scale-f8e045b90304">giving each of us scale</a>&nbsp;across all the entities we deal with. Because it’s&nbsp;our experience that will make identity work right, finally, online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I expect to add more as the conference goes on; but I want to get this much out there to start with.</p>
<p>By the way, the photo above is from the first and only meeting of the Identity Gang, at Esther Dyson’s PC Forum in 2005. The next meeting of the Gang was the first <a href="http://iiworkshop.org">Internet Identity Workshop, aka IIW</a>, later that year. We’ve had 34 more since then, all with hundreds of participants, all with great influence on the development of code, standards, and businesses in digital identity and adjacent fields. And all guided by Kim’s Laws.</p>

<p>In this post, I would like to look at some of the advantages and disadvantages of using an implemented gateway service to process all UI API requests, optimize the business and remove some of the complexity from the user interface application.</p>



<p>Setup with UI using APIs directly</p>



<p>Modern public facing applications APIs used by UI apps are mostly protected using user delegated access tokens and the applications APIs are in the public zone because the SPA application or whatever client you use needs to request data. The API data is merged directly in the client. Each API can be secured with a separate scope and the client application would need to manage multiple access tokens. Each API would need to allow CORS for an SPA client. (You could use something like Azure Gateway as a workaround for this.) If a server rendered application was used to access the API, this is not required. With this approach, multiple APIs are exposed in the public zone.</p>







<p>Characteristics of this solution</p>



<p>UI responsible for joining API calls for different views</p>



<p>Multiple UIs per module, API, micro service possible</p>



<p>Setup with gateway implementation (BFF or API implementation)</p>



<p>All applications still need to implement HTTPS and the gateway should not terminate the HTTPS. All applications still require HTTPS only access and HTTP should not be used (in development as well). Then all the security headers can be applied in all services to the max.</p>



<p>Many micro services implementations do not optimize the API for the UI. This is not really a good idea, if using the APIs directly in a UI. By implementing a gateway service, the micro service APIs can be optimized for the UI through the gateway. This makes it possible to remove lots of unrequired or unoptimized APIs calls and reduces the amount of logic required in the UI to implement the required business.</p>



<p>The application gateway should not be used to apply missing security headers to new APIs or APIs created as part of your system. The security headers should be implemented where the responses are created. If using a legacy application where the security headers are missing and cannot be implemented at the source, then using the gateway in this way is good.</p>



<p>The application gateway could be implemented as a reverse proxy to delegate the requests onto further applications, APIs. This is good because the further APIs do not need to be exposed to the internet and the attack surface is reduced as well as the amount of APIs in the public zone. Less is more.</p>







<p>Characteristics of this solution</p>



<p>API calls can be optimized for the UI</p>



<p>Security can be improved by reducing the public attack surface</p>



<p>User authorization could be moved to the gateway service</p>



<p>UI and gateway could be deployed together with improved security (BFF security arch and single security client)</p>



<p>Gateway single point of failure</p>



<p>Comparing the security of the Gateway, no Gateway solutions</p>



<p>Improved application security with Gateway</p>



<p>By using a gateway, the attack surface can be reduced in the public zone. The gateway API can use a user delegated access token (or a cookie if using a server rendered application or BFF architecture) All other applications can use application tokens (OAuth client credentials flow), certificate authentication or Azure managed identities to protect the APIs. It is important that the APIs are secured and that the public user access token does not work with the private APIs.</p>



<p>Easier to implement systems tests for services</p>



<p>It is hard to implement system tests for APIs using user access tokens. These tokens can only be created using a UI test tool. The correct flow requires user interaction to authenticate. Creating a back door with some type of application access is not a good idea as this usually gets deployed in some form or other. With a gateway, it is still hard to test the gateway, but with all the private APIs, system tests can be created to test with little effort.</p>



<p>CORS, same domain, same site</p>



<p>Only the public facing gateway API needs to allow CORS if using from an SPA application. All the private APIs can completely disable this and all can use the full set of security headers. If using cookies, same site and same domain can be forced on the single gateway, UI application.</p>



<p>User authorization</p>



<p>Authorization for identities with users can be reduced and most of the implementation would be rolled out in the gateway as well as been used in the user interface. The private APIs would need less complicated authorization as only the trusted application requests must be validated and not user authorization. It is not a must, that the system implements in this way, different security setups are possible like the OBO flow for the private APIs.</p>



<p>More choice for authorization in the private APIs.</p>



<p>As the private APIs are trusted APP to APP security, managed identities or certificate authentication could be used as well as OAuth client credentials. This allows for more choice but the APIs must still implement security in the application and not relay on the network security alone. I usually use the OAuth CC flow with a scope claim or role claim validation. The access tokens used for access must be validated. I never mix user access tokens and application tokens in a single API.</p>



<p>Notes</p>



<p>KISS is probably the most important way of thinking when producing software. Most solutions can be implemented as a single monolith application and the end client gets what is required with the least amount of effort. Micro services are normally not required for most solutions. Once using micro services, it is important to implement this correctly and with a solid security architecture which requires effort and planning. Do not be afraid to merge services if you see that the are tightly coupled and depend on each other. Define the public zone and private zone and where each micro service belongs. Implement the hosting environment which allows for a good application security implementation as well as a good network infrastructure. HTTP should not be used anywhere.</p>

<p>It is a question that people (users, customers) ask me from time to time: will you  develop an Apache module that implements <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/">WebAuthn</a> or <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/">FIDO2</a>. Well, the answer is: “no”, and the rationale for that can be found below.</p>



<p>At first glance it seems very useful to have an Apache server that authenticates users using a <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-apple-and-google-to-support-fido-passwordless-logins/amp/">state-of-the-art authentication protocol that is implemented in modern browsers and platforms</a>. Even more so, that Apache server could function as a reverse proxy in front of any type of resources you want to protect. This will allow for those resources to be agnostic to the type of authentication and its implementation, a pattern that <a href="https://hanszandbelt.wordpress.com/2019/08/01/identiverse-2019-presentation/">I’ve been promoting</a> for the last decade or so.</p>



<p>But in reality the functionality that you are looking for already exists…</p>



<p>The point is that deploying WebAuthn means that you’ll not just be authenticating users, you’ll also have to take care of signing up new users and managing credentials for those users. To that end, you’ll need to facilitate an onboarding process and manage a user database. That type of functionality is best implemented in a server-type piece of software (let’s call it “WebAuthn Provider”) written in a high-level programming language, rather than embedding it in a C-based Apache module. So in reality it means that any sensible WebAuthn/FIDO2 Apache module would rely on an externally running “Provider” software component to offload the heavy-lifting of onboarding and managing users and credentials. Moreover, just imagine the security sensitivity of such a software component.</p>



<p>Well, all of the functionality described above is exactly something that your average existing Single Sign On Identity Provider software was designed to do from the very start! And even more so, those Identity Providers typically already support WebAuthn and FIDO2 for (“local”) user authentication and OpenID Connect for relaying the authentication information to (“external”) Relying Parties.</p>



<p>And yes, one of those Relying Parties could be mod_auth_openidc, the Apache module that enables users to authenticate to an Apache webserver using OpenID Connect.</p>



<p>So there you go: rather than implementing WebAuthn or FIDO2 (and user/credential management…) in a single Apache module, or write a dedicated WebAuthn/FIDO2 Provider alongside of it and communicate with that using a proprietary protocol, the more sensible choice is to use the already existing OpenID Connect protocol. The Apache OpenID Connect module (<a href="https://github.com/zmartzone/mod_auth_openidc/">mod_auth_openidc</a>) will send users off to the OpenID Connect Provider for authentication. The Provider can use WebAuthn or FIDO2, as a single factor, or as a 2nd factor combined with traditional methods such as passwords or stronger methods such as PKI, to authenticate users and relay the information about the authenticated user back to the Apache server.</p>



<p>To summarise: using WebAuthn or FIDO2 to authenticate users to an Apache server/reverse-proxy is possible today by using mod_auth_openidc’s OpenID Connect implementation. This module can send user off for authentication towards a WebAuthn/FIDO2 enabled Provider, such as Keycloak, Okta, Ping, ForgeRock etc. This setup allows for a very flexible approach that leverages existing standards and implementations to their maximum potential: OpenID Connect for (federated) Single Sign On, WebAuthn and FIDO2 for (centralized) user authentication.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/__b_c">Brian Campbell</a> has published an updated OAuth DPoP draft addressing the Working Group Last Call (WGLC) comments received.  All changes were editorial in nature.  The most substantive change was further clarifying that either <code>iat</code> or <code>nonce</code> can be used alone in validating the timeliness of the proof, somewhat deemphasizing <code>jti</code> tracking.</p>
<p>As Brian reminded us during the <a href="https://oauth.secworkshop.events/osw2022">OAuth Security Workshop</a> today, the name DPoP was inspired by a Deutsche POP poster he saw on the S-Bahn during the March 2019 OAuth Security Workshop in Stuttgart:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/__b_c/status/1108974390052638720"></a></p>

  <p>Summary:      If you're like me, your smartphone has worked its tentacles into dozens, even hundreds, of areas in your life. I conducted an experiment to see what worked and what didn't when I ditched the phone and used an Apple Watch as my primary device for two days.</p>




<p>
    Last week, I conducted an experiment. My phone battery needed to be replaced and the Authorized Apple Service Center was required to keep it while they ordered the new battery from Apple (yeah, I think that's a stupid policy too). I was without my phone for 2 days and decided it was an excellent time to see if I could get by using my Apple Watch as my primary device. Here's how it went. 
</p>

 
     First things first. For this to be any kind of success you need a cellular plan for your watch and a pair of Airpods or other bluetooth earbuds.  
     The first thing I noticed is that the bathroom, standing in the checkout line, and other places are boring without the distraction of my phone to read news, play Wordle, or whatever.
     
     Siri is your friend. I used Siri a lot more than normal due to the small screen.
     
     I'd already set up Apple Pay and while I don't often use it from my watch under normal circumstances, it worked great here.
     
     Answering the phone means keeping your Airpods in or fumbling for them every time there's a call. I found I rejected a lot of calls to avoid the hassle. (But never your's, Lynne!) Still, I was able to take and make calls just fine without a phone. 
     
     Voicemail access is a problem. You have to call the number and retrieve them just like it's 1990 or something. This messed with my usual strategy of not answering calls from numbers I don't recognize and letting them go to voicemail, then reading the transcript to see if I want to call them back.
     
     Normal texts don't work that I could tell, but Apple Messages do. I used voice transcription almost exclusively for sending messages, but read them on the watch.
     
     Most crypto wallets are unusable without the phone.
     
     For the most part, I just used the Web for banking as a substitute for mobile apps and that worked fine. The one exception was USAA.  
     The problem with USAA was 2FA. Watch apps for 2FA are "companion apps" meaning they're worthless without the phone. For TOTP 2FA, I'd mirrored to my iPad, so that worked fine. I had to use the pre-set tokens for Duo that I'd gotten when I set it up. USAA uses Verisign's VIP. It can't be mirrored. What's more, USAA's recovery relies on SMS. I didn't have my phone, so that didn't work. I was on the phone with USAA for an hour trying to figure this out. Eventually USAA decided it was hopeless and told me to conduct banking by voice. Ugh.
     
     Listening to music on the watch worked fine. 
     I read books on my Kindle, so that wasn't a problem.
     
     There are a number of things I fell back to my iPad for. I've already mentioned 2FA, another is maps. Maps don't work on the watch.
     
     I didn't realize how many pictures I take in a day, sometimes just for utility. I used the iPad when I had to.
     
     Almost none of my IoT services or devices did much with the watch beyond issuing a notification. None of the Apple HomeKit stuff worked that I could see. For example, I often use a HomeKit integration with my garage door opener. That no longer worked without a phone.
     
     Battery life on the watch is more than adequate in normal situations. But hour long phone calls and listening to music challenge battery life when it's your primary device. 
     
     I didn't realize how many things are tied just to my phone number.  
 

<p>
    Using just my Apple Watch with some help from my iPad was mostly doable, but there are still rough spots. The Watch is a capable tool for many tasks, but it's not complete. I can certainly see leaving my phone at home more often now since most things work great—especially when you know you can get back to your phone when you need to. Not having my phone with me feels less scary now.

<p>This post shows how to setup a Keycloak external authentication in an OpenIddict identity provider using ASP.NET Core identity. </p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCoreOpeniddict">https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCoreOpeniddict</a></p>



<p>Setup</p>



<p>The solution context implements OpenID Connect clients which use an OpenIddict identity provider and ASP.NET Core Identity to manage the accounts. All clients authenticate using the OpenIddict server. Keycloak is used as an external authentication provider on the OpenIddict identity provider. Users can be created in either identity provider. If only users are created on the Keycloak server, the direct sign in with username, password can be completely disabled in the OpenIddict server. This setup allows for great flexibility and the MFA can be forced anywhere depending on the requirements. Companies using the product can use their own identity provider. </p>







<p>Integrating an OpenID Connect conform client is really simple in ASP.NET Core and no extra Nuget packages are required. You only need extra packages when the IDP are not conform or do something vendor specific.  The AddOpenIdConnect method is used to implement the Keycloak server. I set this up using this <a href="https://github.com/tuxiem/AspNetCore-keycloak">github</a> repo and the Keycloak docs. The SignInScheme needs to be set to the correct value. ASP.NET Core Identity is used to map the external identities and the “Identity.External” is the default scheme used for this. If you need to disable local identity users, the ASP.NET Core Identity logic can be scaffolded into the project and adapted.</p>


  services.AddAuthentication(CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
	.AddOpenIdConnect("KeyCloak", "KeyCloak", options =&gt;
	{
		options.SignInScheme = "Identity.External";
		//Keycloak server
		options.Authority = Configuration.GetSection("Keycloak")["ServerRealm"];
		//Keycloak client ID
		options.ClientId = Configuration.GetSection("Keycloak")["ClientId"];
		//Keycloak client secret in user secrets for dev
		options.ClientSecret = Configuration.GetSection("Keycloak")["ClientSecret"];
		//Keycloak .wellknown config origin to fetch config
		options.MetadataAddress = Configuration.GetSection("Keycloak")["Metadata"];
		//Require keycloak to use SSL
		
		options.GetClaimsFromUserInfoEndpoint = true;
		options.Scope.Add("openid");
		options.Scope.Add("profile");
		options.SaveTokens = true;
		options.ResponseType = OpenIdConnectResponseType.Code;
		options.RequireHttpsMetadata = false; //dev

		options.TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
		{
			NameClaimType = "name",
			RoleClaimType = ClaimTypes.Role,
			ValidateIssuer = true
		};
	});
  


<p>The Keycloak configuration is added to the app.settings. We do not need much, a standard OpenID connect confidential code flow client with PKCE is setup to authenticate using Keycloak. This can be adapted, changed in almost any way depending on the server requirements. You should stick to the standards when implementing this. Using PKCE is required now on most deployments when using the OIDC code flow. Any identity providers solutions which does not support this should be avoided.</p>


    "Keycloak": {
    "ServerRealm": "http://localhost:8080/realms/myrealm",
    "Metadata": "http://localhost:8080/realms/myrealm/.well-known/openid-configuration",
    "ClientId": "oidc-code-pkce",
    // "ClientSecret": "--in user secrets or keyvault--"
  },
  


<p>The Keycloak server is setup to use the standard settings. You could improve the security of this using token exchange or further supported specifications from Keycloak and ASP.NET Core.</p>







<p>Notes:</p>



<p>Using OpenIddict and ASP.NET Core to federate to further identity providers, it is really easy to support best practice application security and also integrate any third party identity systems without surprises. Having full control of your identity provider is a good thing and by using federation, you do not need to manage the user accounts. This can be fully implemented on the client system. If the application requires strong MFA like FIDO2, this can also be easily implemented in ASP.NET Core. Using some of the cloud solution IDPs prevents you implementing strong application security. These cloud systems do provide excellent user accounting and it would be nice to use this and combine this with a top identity provider.</p>



<p>If implementing a product which needs to support multiple different identity providers from different clients, then you should implement the identity provider as part of your solution context and federate to the client systems. </p>

  <p>Summary:      The Internet of Things is more like the CompuServe of Things. We need a new, self-sovereign model to protect us from proprietary solutions and unlock IoT's real potential.</p>


<p>
    Last week <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/04/shameful-insteon-looks-dead-just-like-its-users-smart-homes/">Insteon, a large provider of smart home devices, abruptly closed its doors</a>. While their web site is still up and advertises them as "the most reliable and simplest way to turn your home into a smart home," the company seems to have abruptly shut down their cloud service without warning or providing a way for customers to continue using their products, which depend on Insteon's privacy cloud. High-ranking Insteon execs even removed their affiliation with Insteon from their LinkedIn profiles. Eek! 
</p>

<p>
    Fortunately, someone reverse-engineered the Insteon protocol a while back and there are some open-source solutions for people who are able to run their own servers or know someone who can do it for them. <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/insteon/">Home Assistant</a> is one. <a href="https://www.openhab.org/addons/bindings/insteon/">OpenHAB</a> is another.
</p>

<p>
    Insteon isn't alone. Apparently <a href="https://twitter.com/Homekitgeek/status/1499900568743165952">iHome</a> terminated its service on April 2, 2022. Other smarthome companies or services who have gone out of business include Revolv, Insignia, Wink, and Staples Connect. 
</p>

<p>
    The problem with Insteon, and every other IoT and Smarthome company I'm aware of is that their model looks like this:
</p>

	<a></a>
	Private cloud IoT model; grey box represents domain of control

<p>
    In this model, you:
</p>
 
     Buy the device 
     Download their app 
     Create an account on the manufacturer's private cloud 
     Register your device 
     Control the device from the app 
 
<p>
    All the data and the device are inside the manufacturer's private cloud. They administer it all and control what you can do. Even though you paid for the device, you don't own it because it's worthless without the service the manufacturer provides. If they take your account away (or everyone's account, in the case of Insteon), you're out of luck. Want to use your motion detector to turn on the lights? Good luck unless they're from the same company1. I call this the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2014/04/the_compuserve_of_things.shtml">CompuServe of Things</a>. 
</p>

<p>
    The alternative is what I call the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/12/the_self-sovereign_internet_of_things.shtml">self-sovereign IoT (SSIoT) model</a>:
</p>

	<a></a>
	Self-sovereign IoT model; grey box represents domain of control

<p>
    Like the private-cloud model, in the SSIoT model, you also:
</p>
 
     Buy the device 
     Download an app 
     Establish a relationship with a compatible service provider 
     Register the device 
     Control the device using the app 
 
<p>
    The fact that the flows for these two models are the same is a feature. The difference lies elsewhere: in SSIoT, your device, the data about you, and the service are all under your control. You might have a relationship with the device manufacturer, but you and your devices are not under their administrative control. This might feel unworkable, but I've proven it's not. Ten years ago we built a connected-car platform called <a href="https://www.windley.com/tags/fuse.shtml">Fuse</a> that used the SSIoT model. All the data was under the control of the person or persons who owned the fleet and could be moved to an alternate platform without loss of data or function.  People used the Fuse service that we provided, but they didn't have to. If Fuse had gotten popular, other service providers could have provided the same or similar service based on the open-model and Fuse owners would have had a choice of service providers. <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2014/03/substitutability_is_an_indispensable_property_for_the_internet_of_things.shtml">Substitutability is an indispensable property for the internet of things</a>.
</p>

<p>
    All companies die. Some last a long time, but even then they frequently kill off products. Having to buy all your gear from a single vendor and use their private cloud puts your IoT project at risk of being stranded, like Insteon customers have been. Hopefully, the open-source solutions will provide the basis for some relief to them. But the ultimate answer is interoperability and self-sovereignty as the default. That's the only way we ditch the CompuServe of Things for a real internet of things. 
</p>

 
<a></a>
 Notes 
 
     Apple HomeKit and Google Home try to solve this problem, but you're still dependent on the manufacturer to provide the basic service. And making the administrative domain bigger is nice, but doesn't result in self-sovereignty.

It’s raining again today, and we’re grateful. This will help put a damper on what was shaping up to be a terrifying early start of fire season. But the tiny amounts won’t make a dent in the drought. The recent showers bring us to 24 inches of rain for the season, about 2/3 of normal. But 10 of those 24 inches came in one big burst on Oct 24. </p>
<p>
Here are a bunch of those raindrops sailing down the Santa Rosa creek to the mouth of the Russian River at Jenner.</p>
  
<p>
With Sam Learner’s amazing <a href="https://river-runner.samlearner.com/?lng=-122.58120904408338&amp;lat=38.46418317061841">River Runner</a> we can follow a drop that fell in the Mayacamas range as it makes its way to the ocean.</p>
  
<p></p>
<p>
Until 2014 I’d only ever lived east of the Mississipi River, in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Maryland, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire. During those decades there may never have been a month with zero precipitation. </p>
<p>
I still haven’t adjusted to a region where it can be dry for many months. In 2017, the year of the devastating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubbs_Fire">Tubbs Fire</a>, there was no rain from April through October. </p>
<p>
California relies heavily on the dwindling Sierra snowpack for storage and timed release of water. Clearly we need a complementary method of storage and release, and this passage in Kim Stanley Robinson’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ministry_for_the_Future">Ministry for the Future</a> imagines it beautifully.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Typically the Sierra snowpack held about fifteen million acre-feet of water every spring, releasing it to reservoirs in a slow melt through the long dry summers.  The dammed reservoirs in the foothills could hold about forty million acre-feet when full. Then the groundwater basin underneath the central valley could hold around a thousand million acre-feet; and that immense capacity might prove their salvation. In droughts they could pump up groundwater and put it to use; then during flood years they needed to replenish that underground reservoir, by capturing water on the land and not allow it all to spew out the Golden Gate. </p>
 

 
<p>…</p>
<p>
Now the necessity to replumb the great valley for recharge had forced them to return a hefty percentage of the land to the kind of place it had been before Europeans arrived. The industrial agriculture of yesteryear had turned the valley into a giant factory floor, bereft of anything but products grown for sale; unsustainable ugly, devastated, inhuman, and this in a place that had been called the “Serengeti of North America,” alive with millions of animals, including megafauna like tule elk and grizzly bear and mountain lion and wolves. All those animals had been exterminated along with their habitat, in the first settlers’ frenzied quest to use the valley purely for food production, a kind of secondary gold rush. Now the necessity of dealing with droughts and floods meant that big areas of the valley were restored, and the animals brought back, in a system of wilderness parks or habitat corridors, all running up into the foothills that ringed the central valley on all sides.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The book, which Wikipedia charmingly classifies as cli-fi, grabbed me from page one and never let go. It’s an extraordinary blend of terror and hope. But this passage affected me in the most powerful way. As Marc Reisner’s <a href="https://www.librarything.com/work/57189">Cadillac Desert</a> explains, and as I’ve <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2018/11/25/the-reengineering-of-three-california-lakes/">seen for myself</a>, we’ve already engineered the hell out of California’s water systems, with less than stellar results. </p>
<p>
Can we redo it and get it right this time? I don’t doubt our technical and industrial capacity. Let’s hope it doesn’t take an event like the one the book opens with — a heat wave in India that kills 20 million people in a week — to summon the will.</p>

<blockquote><p>“I was working on an online trading-card game in the early days that had player-to-player card trades enabled through our servers. The vast majority of our customer support emails dealt with requests to reverse a trade because of some kind of trade scams. When I saw <a href="https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/news/10245930">Hearthstone’s dust system</a>, I realized it was genius; they probably cut their support costs by around 90% with that move alone.”</p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ian-schreiber-733bab/">Ian Schreiber</a></blockquote>



 A Game’s Governance Domain 



<p>There have always been key governance requirements for object trading economies in online games, even before user-generated-content enters the picture.&nbsp; I call this the game’s object governance domain.<br><br>Typically, an online game object governance domain has the following features (amongst others omitted for brevity):</p>



  There is usually at least one fungible token currency  There is often a mechanism for player-to-player direct exchange  There is often one or more automattic markets to exchange between tokens and objects  May be player to player transactions  May be operator to player transactions (aka vending and recycling machinery)  Managed by the game operator    There is a mechanism for reporting problems/disputes  There is a mechanism for adjudicating conflicts  There are mechanisms for resolving a disputes, including:  Reversing transactions  Destroying objects  Minting and distributing objects  Minting and distributing tokens  Account, Character, and Legal sanctions  Rarely: Changes to TOS and Community Guidelines    



<p><br>In short, the economy is entirely in the ultimate control of the game operator. In effect, anything can be “undone” and injured parties can be “made whole” through an entire range of solutions.</p>



 Scary Future: Crypto? Where’s Undo? 



<p>Introducing blockchain tokens (BTC, for example) means that certain transactions become “irreversible”, since all transactions on the chain are 1) Atomic and 2) Expensive. In contrast, many thousands of credit-card transactions are reversed every minute of every day (accidental double charges, stolen cards, etc.) Having a market to sell an in-game object for BTC will require extending the governance domain to cover very specific rules about what happens when the purchaser has a conflict with a transaction. Are you really going to tell customers “All BTC transactions are final. No refunds. Even if your kid spent the money without permission. Even if someone stole your wallet”?</p>



 Nightmare Future: Game UGC &amp; NFTs? Ack! 



<p>At least with your own game governance domain, you had complete control over IP presented in your game and some control, or at least influence, over the games economy. But it gets pretty intense to think about objects/resources created by non-employees being purchased/traded on markets outside of your game governance domain.</p>



<p>When your game allows content that was not created within that game’s governance domain, all bets are off when it comes to trying to service customer support calls. And there will be several orders of magnitude more complaints. Look at Twitter, Facebook, and Youtube and all of the mechanisms they need to support IP-related complaints, abuse complaints, and robot-spam content. Huge teams of folks spending millions of dollars in support of Machine Learning are not able to stem the tide. Those companies’ revenue depends primarily on UGC, so that’s what they have to deal with.</p>



<p>NFTs are no help. They don’t come with any governance support whatsoever. They are an unreliable resource pointer. There is no way to make any testable claims about any single attribute of the resource. When they point to media resources (video, jpg, etc.) there is no way to verify that the resource reference is valid or legal in any governance domain. Might as well be whatever someone randomly uploaded to a photo service – oh wait, it is.</p>

Oh, and now they are blocking IDs/IPs from <a href="https://bharatsuchana.com/nft-platform-opensea-starts-obstructing-users-says-its-following-us-sanctions-list-of-banned-nations/crypto/">sanctioned countries</a>.<br><br>So, even if a game tries to accept NFT resources into their game – they end up in the same situation as OpenSea – inheriting all the problems of irreversibility, IP abuse, plus new kinds of harassment with no real way to resolve complaints.</p>



<p>Until blockchain tokens have RL-bank-style undo, and decentralized trading systems provide mechanisms for a reasonable standard of governance, online games should probably just stick with what they know: “If we made it, we’ll deal with any governance problems ourselves.”</p>

<p>At the recent <a href="https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/113/">IETF 113 meeting in Vienna, Austria</a>, we put the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-gnap-core-protocol-09.html">GNAP protocol</a> to the test by submitting it as a Hackathon project. Over the course of the weekend, we built out GNAP components and pointed them at each other to see what stuck. Here’s what we&nbsp;learned.</p> Our Goals <p>GNAP is a big protocol, and there was no reasonable way for us to build out literally every piece and option of it in our limited timeframe. While GNAP’s transaction negotiation patterns make the protocol fail gracefully when two sides don’t have matching features, we wanted to aim for success. As a consequence, we decided to focus on a few key interoperability points:</p>  <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-httpbis-message-signatures-08.html">HTTP Message Signatures</a> for key proofing, with <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-httpbis-digest-headers-08.html">Content Digest</a> for protecting the body of POST messages.  Redirect-based interaction, to get there and&nbsp;back.  Dynamic keys, not relying on pre-registration at the&nbsp;AS.  Single access&nbsp;tokens.  <p>While some of the components built out did support additional features, these were the ones we chose as a baseline to make everything work as best as it could. We laid out our goals to get these components to talk to each other in increasingly complete&nbsp;layers.</p><p>Our goal of the hackathon wasn’t just to create code, we wanted to replicate a developer’s experience when approaching GNAP for the first time. Wherever possible, we tried to use libraries to cover existing functionality, including HTTP Signatures, cryptographic primitives, and <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8941.html">HTTP Structured Fields</a>. We also used the existing <a href="https://github.com/bspk/oauth.xyz-java">XYZ Java implementation of GNAP</a> to test things&nbsp;out.</p> New Clients <p>With all of this in hand, we set about building some clients from scratch. Since we had a functioning AS to build against, focusing on the clients allowed us to address different platforms and languages than we otherwise had. We settled on three very different kinds of client software:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/bspk/oauth.xyz-java/blob/master/rc/src/main/js/spa.js">A single page application</a>, written in JavaScript with no backend components.  <a href="https://github.com/aaronpk/gnap-client-php">A command line application</a>, written in&nbsp;PHP.  <a href="https://github.com/aaronpk/gnap-client-php/tree/main/public">A web application</a>, written in&nbsp;PHP.  <p>By the end of the weekend, we were able to get all three of these working, and the demonstration results are <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/113/materials/slides-113-gnap-ietf-113-hackathon-results-00">available as part of the hackathon readout</a>. This might not seem like much, but the core functionality of all three clients was written completely from scratch, including the HTTP Signatures implementation.</p> Getting Over the&nbsp;Hump <p>Importantly, we also tried to work in such a way that the different components could be abstracted out after the fact. While we could have written very GNAP-specific code to handle the key handling and signing, we opted to instead create generic functions that could sign and present any HTTP message. This decision had two&nbsp;effects.</p><p>First, once we had the signature method working, the rest of the GNAP implementation went very, very quickly. GNAP is designed in such a way as to leverage HTTP, JSON, and security layers like HTTP Message Signatures as much as it can. What this meant meant for us during implementation is that getting the actual GNAP exchange to happen was a simple set of HTTP calls and JSON objects. All the layers did their job appropriately, keeping abstractions from leaking between&nbsp;them.</p><p>Second, this will give us a chance to extract the HTTP Message Signature code into truly generic libraries across different languages. HTTP Message Signatures is used in places other than GNAP, and so a GNAP implementor is going to want to use a dedicated library for this core function instead of having to write their own like we&nbsp;did.</p><p>We had a similar reaction to elements like structured field libraries, which helped with serialization and message-building, and cryptographic functions. As HTTP Message Signatures in particular gets built out more across different ecosystems, we’ll see more and more support for fundamental tooling.</p> Bug Fixes <p>Another important part of the hackathon was the discovery and patching of bugs in the existing XYZ <a href="https://github.com/bspk/oauth.xyz-java/tree/master/as">authorization server</a> and <a href="https://github.com/bspk/oauth.xyz-java/tree/master/rc">Java Servlet web-based client</a> code. At the beginning of the weekend, these pieces of software worked with each other. However, it became quickly apparent that there were a number of issues and assumptions in the implementation. Finding things like this is one of the best things that can come out of a hackathon — by putting different code from different developers against each other, you can figure out where code is weak, and sometimes, where the specification itself is&nbsp;unclear.</p> Constructing the&nbsp;Layers <p>Probably the most valuable outcome of the hackathon, besides the working code itself, is a concrete appreciation of how clear the spec is from the eyes of someone trying to build to it. We came out of the weekend with a number of improvements that need to be made to GNAP and HTTP Message Signatures, but also ideas on what additional developer support there should be in the community at large. These things will be produced and incorporated over time, and hopefully make the GNAP ecosystem brighter and stronger as a&nbsp;result.</p><p>In the end, a specification isn’t real unless you have running code to prove it. Even more if people can use that code in their own systems to get real work done. GNAP, like most standards, is just a layer in the internet stack. It builds on technologies and technologies will be built on&nbsp;it.</p><p>Our first hackathon experience has shown this to be a pretty solid layer. <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/general/wiki/Implementations-and-Libraries">Come, build with&nbsp;us!</a></p>

  <p>What is the common theme in these commonly stated problems with the
internet today?</p>
 
 Too much tracking you from one site to another. 
 Wrong approach to moderation (too heavy-handed, too light, inconsistent,
contextually inappropriate etc). 
 Too much fake news. 
 Too many advertisements. 
 Products that make you addicted, or are otherwise bad for your mental
health. 
 
<p>In my view, the common theme underlying these problems is:
“The wrong decisions were made.”
That’s it. Not technology, not product, not price, not marketing, not
standards, not legal, nor whatever else. Just that the wrong decisions
were made.</p>
<p>Maybe it was:</p>
 
 
<p>The wrong people made the decisions. Example: should it really be Mark
Zuckerberg who decides which of my friends’ posts I see?</p>
 
 
<p>The wrong goals were picked by the decisionmakers and they are
optimizing for those. Example: I don’t want to be “engaged” more and I don’t care
about another penny per share for your earnings release.</p>
 
 
<p>A lack of understanding or interest in the complexity of a situation,
and inability for the people with the understanding to make the decision instead.
Example: are a bunch of six-figure Silicon Valley guys really the ones who should decide
what does and does not inflame religious tensions in a low-income
country half-way around the world with a societal structure that’s
fully alien to liberal Northern California?</p>
 
 
<p>What do we call the thing that deals with who gets to decide, who has
to agree, who can keep them from doing bad things and the like? Yep,
it’s “governance”.</p>
<p>Back in the 1980’s in 90’s, all we cared about was code. So when the commercial
powers started <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Letter_to_Hobbyists">abusing their power</a>,
in the mind of some users, those users pushed back with projects such
as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU">GNU</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">open-source</a>.</p>
<p>But we’ve long moved on from there. In one of the defining characteristics of
Web2 over Web1, data has become more important than the code.</p>
<p>Starting about 15 years ago, it was suddenly the data scientists and machine learning
people who started getting the big bucks, not the coders any more. Today the
fight is not about who had the code any more; it is about who has the data.</p>
<p>Pretty much the entire technology industry understands that now. What
it doesn’t understand yet is that the consumer internet crisis we are in
is best understood as a need to add another layer to the sandwich:
not just the right code, not just plus the right data, but also plus
the right governance: have the right people decide for the right reasons,
and the mechanisms to get rid of the decisionmakers if the affected community
decides they made the wrong decisions or had the wrong reasons.</p>
<p>Have you noticed that pretty much all senior technologists that dismiss
Web3 — usually in highly emotional terms – completely ignore that
pretty much all the genuinely interesting innovations in the Web3 world
are governance innovations? (never mind blockchain, it’s just a means
to an end for those innovators).</p>
<p>If we had governance as part of the consumer technology sandwich, then:</p>
 
 
<p>Whether I see which of my friends’ posts should be decisions that
I make with my friends, and nobody else gets a say.</p>
 
 
<p>Whether a product optimizes for this or that should be a decision that
is made by its users, not some remote investors or power-hungry executives.</p>
 
 
<p>A community of people half-way around the world should determine,
on its own for its own purposes, what is good for its members.</p>
 
 
<p>(If we had a functioning competitive marketplace, Adam Smith-style, then
we would probably get this because products that do what the customers want
win over products that don’t. But have monopolies instead that cement the
decisionmaking in the wrong places for the wrong reasons. A governance
problem, in other words.)</p>
<p>If you want to get ahead of the curve, pay attention to this. All the
genuinely new stuff in technology that I’ve seen for a few years has
genuinely new ideas about governance. It’s a complete game changer.</p>
<p>Conversely, if you build technology with the same rudimentary, often
dictatorial and almost always dysfunctional governance we have had
for technology in the Web1 and Web2 world, you are fundamentally building
a solution for the past, not for the future.</p>
<p>To be clear, better governance for technology is in the pre-kindergarten
stage. It’s like the Apple 1 of the personal computer – assembly required –
or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archie_(search_engine)">Archie</a> stage
of the internet. But we would have been wrong to dismiss those as mere
fads then, and it would be wrong to dismiss the crucial importance of
governance now.</p>
<p>That, for me, is the essence of how the thing after Web2 – and we might
as well call it Web3 – is different. And it is totally exciting! Because
“better governance” is just another way to say: the users get to have a say!!</p>

<p>As I’ve mentioned <a href="https://www.rdegges.com/2020/my-personal-financial-strategy/">before</a>, I’m a bit of a personal finance nerd. I’ve been carefully tracking my spending and investing for many years now. In particular, I find the investing side of personal finance fascinating.</p>

<p>For the last eight years, my wife and I have split our investments roughly 50⁄50 between broadly diversified index funds and real estate (rental properties).</p>

<p>Earlier this week, I was discussing real estate investing with some friends, and we had a great conversation about why you might even consider investing in real estate in the first place. As I explained my strategy to them, I thought it might make for an interesting blog post (especially if you’re new to the world of investing).</p>

<p>Please note that I’m not an expert, just an enthusiastic hobbyist. Like all things I work on, I like to do a lot of research, experimentation, etc., but don’t take this as financial advice.</p>

 Why Invest in Stocks 

<p></p>

<p>Before discussing whether real estate or stocks is the better investment, let’s talk about how stocks work. If you don’t understand how to invest in stocks (and what rewards you can expect from them), the comparison between real estate and stocks will be meaningless.</p>

 What is a Stock? 

<p>Stocks are the simplest form of investment you can make. If you buy one share of Tesla stock for $100, you’re purchasing one tiny sliver of the entire company and are now a part-owner!</p>

<p>Each stock you hold can either earn or lose money, depending on how the company performs. For example, if Tesla doesn’t sell as many vehicles as the prior year, it’s likely that the company will not make as much money and will therefore be worth less than it was a year ago, so the value of the stock might drop. In this case, the one share of Tesla stock you purchased for $100 might only be worth $90 (a 10% drop in value!).</p>

<p>But, stocks can also make you money. If Tesla sells more vehicles than anyone expected, the company might be worth more, and now your one share of Tesla stock might be worth $110 (a 10% gain!). This gain is referred to as appreciation because the value of your stock has appreciated.</p>

<p>In addition to appreciation, you can also make money through dividends. While some companies choose to take any profits they make and reinvest them into the business to make more products, conduct research, etc., some companies take their profits and split them up amongst their shareholders. We call this distribution a dividend. When a dividend is paid, you’ll receive a set amount of money per share as a shareholder. For example, if Tesla issues a 10 cent dividend per share, you’ll receive $0.10 of spending money as the proud owner of one share of Tesla stock!</p>

<p>But here’s the thing, investing in stocks is RISKY. It’s risky because companies make mistakes, and even the most highly respected and valuable companies today can explode overnight and become worthless (Enron, anyone?). Because of this, generally speaking, it’s not advisable to ever buy individual stocks.</p>

<p>Instead, the best way to invest in stocks is by purchasing index funds.</p>

 What is an Index Fund? 

<p>Index funds are stocks you buy that are essentially collections of other stocks. If you invest in Vanguard’s popular <a href="https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/fees/vtsax">VTSAX</a> index fund, for example, you’re buying a small amount of all publicly traded companies in the US.</p>

<p>This approach is much less risky than buying individual stocks because VTSAX is well-diversified. If any of the thousands of companies in the US goes out of business, it doesn’t matter to you because you only own a very tiny amount of it.</p>

<p>The way index funds work is simple: if the value of the index as a whole does well (the US economy in our example), the value of your index fund rises. If the value of the index as a whole does poorly, the value of your index fund drops. Simple!</p>

 How Well Do Index Funds Perform? 

<p>Let’s say you invest your money into VTSAX and now own a small part of all US companies. How much money can you expect to make?</p>

<p>While there’s no way to predict the future, what we can do is look at the past. By looking at the average return of the stock market since 1926 (when the first index was created), you can see that <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/average-stock-market-return">the average return of the largest US companies has been ~10% annually</a> (before inflation).</p>

<p>If you were to invest in VTSAX over a long period of time, it’s historically likely that you’ll earn an average of 10% per year. And understanding that the US market averages 10% per year is exciting because if you invest a little bit of money each month into index funds, you’ll become quite wealthy.</p>

<p>If you plug some numbers into a <a href="http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm">compound interest calculator</a>, you’ll see what I mean.</p>

<p>For example, if you invest $1,000 per month into index funds for 30 years, you’ll end up with $2,171,321.10. If you start working at 22, then by the time you’re 52, you’ll have over two million dollars: not bad!</p>

 How Much Money Do I Need to Retire if I Invest in Index Funds? 

<p></p>

<p>Now that you know how index funds work and how much they historically earn, you might be wondering: how much money do I need to invest in index funds before I can retire?</p>

<p>As it turns out, there’s a simple answer to this question, but before I give you the answer, let’s talk about how this works.</p>

<p>Imagine you have one million dollars invested in index funds that earn an average of 10% yearly. You could theoretically sell 10% of your index funds each year and never run out of money in this scenario. Or at least, this makes sense at first glance.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, while it’s true that the market has returned a historical average of 10% yearly, this is an average, and actual yearly returns vary significantly by year. For example, you might be up 30% one year down 40% the next.</p>

<p>This unpredictability year-over-year makes it difficult to safely withdraw money each year without running out of money due to <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sequence-risk.asp">sequence of return risk</a>.</p>

<p>Essentially, while it’s likely that you’ll earn 10% per year on average if you invest in a US index fund, you will likely run out of money if you sell 10% of your portfolio per year due to fluctuating returns each year.</p>

<p>Luckily, a lot of research has been done on this topic, and the general consensus is that if you only withdraw 4% of your investments per year, you’ll have enough money to last you a long time (a 30-year retirement). This is known as <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/four-percent-rule.asp">the 4% rule</a> and is the gold standard for retirement planning.</p>

<p>Using the 4% rule as a baseline, you can quickly determine how much money you need to invest to retire with your desired spending.</p>

<p>For example, let’s say you want to retire and live off $100k per year. In this case, $100k is 4% of $2.5m, so you’ll need at least $2.5m invested to retire safely.</p>

<p>PRO TIP: You can easily calculate how much you need invested to retire if you simply take your desired yearly spend and multiply it by 25. For example, $40k * 25 = $1m, $100k * 25 = $2.5m, etc.</p>

<p>By only withdrawing 4% of your total portfolio per year, it’s historically likely that you’ll never run out of money over 30 years. Need a longer retirement? You may want to aim for a 3.5% withdrawal rate (or lower).</p>

 Should I Invest in Index Funds? 

<p></p>

<p>I’m a big fan of index fund investing, which is why my wife and I put 50% of our money into index funds.</p>

 
 Index funds are simple to purchase and sell (you can do it instantly using an investment broker like <a href="https://investor.vanguard.com/corporate-portal/">Vanguard</a>) in seconds 
 Index funds have an excellent historical track record (10% average yearly returns is fantastic!) 
 Index funds are often tax-advantaged (they are easy to purchase through a company 401k plan, IRA, or other tax-sheltered accounts) 
 

 Why Invest in Real Estate? 

<p></p>

<p>Now that we’ve discussed index funds, how they work, what returns you can expect if you invest in index funds, and how much money you need to invest to retire using index funds, we can finally talk about real estate.</p>

 What Qualifies as a Real Estate Investment? 

<p></p>

<p>Like stocks and other types of securities, there are multiple ways to invest in real estate. I’m going to cover the most basic form of real estate investing here, but know that there are many other ways to invest in real estate that I won’t cover today due to how complex it can become.</p>

<p>At a basic level, investing in real estate means you’re purchasing a property: a house, condo, apartment building, piece of land, commercial building, etc.</p>

 How Do Real Estate Investors Make Money? 

<p></p>

<p>There are many ways to make money through investing in real estate. Again, I’m only going to cover the most straightforward ways here due to the topic’s complexities.</p>

<p>Let’s say you own an investment property. The typical ways you might make money from this investment are:</p>

 
 Renting the property out for a profit 
 Owning the property as its value rises over time. For example, if you purchased a house ten years ago for $100k worth $200k today, you’ve essentially “earned” $100k in profit, even if you haven’t yet sold the property. This is called appreciation. 
 

<p>Simple, right?</p>

 What’s One Major Difference Between Index Funds and Real Estate? 

<p></p>

<p>One of the most significant differences between real estate investing and index fund investing is leverage.</p>

<p>When you invest in an index fund like VTSAX, you’re buying a little bit of the index using your own money directly. This means if you purchase $100k of index funds and earn 10% on your money, you’ll have $110k of investments.</p>

<p>On the other hand, real estate is often purchased using leverage (aka: bank loans). It’s common to buy an investment property and only put 20-25% of your own money into the investment while seeking a mortgage from a bank to cover the remaining 75-80%.</p>

<p>The benefit of using leverage is that you can stretch your money further. For example, let’s say you have $100k to invest. You could put this $100k into VTSAX or purchase one property worth $500k (20% down on a $500k property means you only need $100k as a down payment).</p>

<p>Imagine these two scenarios:</p>

 
 Scenario 1: You invest $100k in VTSAX and earn precisely 10% per year 
 Scenario 2: You put a $100k down payment on a $500k property that you rent out for a profit of $500 per month after expenses (we call this cash flow), and this property appreciates at a rate of 6% per year. Also, assume that you can secure a 30-year fixed-rate loan for the remaining $400k at a 4.5% interest rate. 
 

<p>After ten years, in Scenario 1, you’ll have $259,374.25. Not bad! That’s a total profit of $159,374.25.</p>

<p>But what will you have after ten years in Scenario 2?</p>

<p>In Scenario 2, you’ll have:</p>

 
 A property whose value has increased from $500k to $895,423.85 (an increase of $395,423.85) 
 Cash flow of $60k 
 A total remaining mortgage balance of $320,357.74 (a decrease of $79,642.26) 
 

<p>If you add these benefits up, in Scenario 2, you’ve essentially ballooned your original $100k investment into a total gain of $535,066.11. That’s three times the gain you would have gotten had you simply invested your $100k into VTSAX!</p>

<p>There are a lot of variables at play here, but you get the general idea. While investing in index funds is profitable and straightforward, if you’re willing to learn the business and put in the work, you can often make higher returns through real estate investing over the long haul.</p>

 How Difficult is Real Estate Investing? 

<p></p>

<p>Real estate investing is complicated. It requires a lot of knowledge, effort, and ongoing work to run a successful real estate investing operation. Among other things, you need to know:</p>

 
 How much a potential investment property will rent for 
 How much a potential investment property will appreciate 
 What sort of mortgage rates you can secure 
 What your expenses will be each month 
 How much property taxes will cost 
 How much insurance will cost 
 Etc. 
 

<p>All of the items above are variables that can dramatically impact whether or not a particular property is a good or bad investment. And this doesn’t even begin to account for the other things you need to do on an ongoing basis: manage the property, manage your accounts/taxes, follow all relevant laws, etc.</p>

<p>In short: investing in real estate is not simple and requires a lot of knowledge to do successfully. But, if you’re interested in running a real estate business, it can be a fun and profitable venture.</p>

 How We Invest in Real Estate 

<p></p>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, my wife and I split our investable assets 50⁄50 between index funds and real estate. The reason we do this is twofold:</p>

 
 It’s easy (and safe) for us to invest money in index funds 
 It’s hard for us to invest in real estate (it took a lot of time and research to get started), but we generally earn greater returns on our real estate investments than we do on our index investments 
 

<p>Our real-estate investing criteria are pretty simple.</p>

 
 We only purchase residential real estate that we rent out to long-term tenants. We do this because it’s relatively low-risk, low-maintenance, and straightforward. 
 We only purchase rental properties that generate a cash-on-cash return of 8% or greater. For example, if we buy a $200k property with a $40k downpayment, we need to earn $3,200 per year in profit ($3,200 is 8% of $40k) for the deal to make sense. 
 We don’t factor appreciation into our investment calculations as we plan to hold these rental properties long-term and never sell them. The rising value of the rental properties we acquire isn’t as beneficial to us as is the cash flow. 
 Over time, the properties pay themselves off, and once they’re free and clear, we’ll have a much larger monthly profit. 
 

<p>Why did we choose an 8% cash-on-cash return as our target metric for rental property purchases? In short, it’s because that 8% is roughly twice the safe withdrawal rate of our index funds.</p>

<p>I figured early on that if I was going to invest a ton of time and energy into learning about real estate investing, hunting down opportunities, etc., I’d have to make it worthwhile by at least doubling the safe withdrawal rate of our index funds. Otherwise, I could simply invest our money into VTSAX and never think about taking on extra work or risk.</p>

<p>Today, my wife and I own a small portfolio of single-family homes that we rent out to long-term tenants, each earning roughly 8% cash-on-cash return yearly.</p>

 Should I Invest in Stocks or Real Estate? 

<p></p>

<p>As you’ve seen by now, there isn’t a clear answer here. To sum it up:</p>

 
 If you’re looking for the most straightforward path to retirement, invest your money in well-diversified index funds like VTSAX. Index funds will allow you to retire with a 4% safe withdrawal rate and slowly build your wealth over time. 
 If you’re interested in real estate and are willing to put in the time and effort to learn about it, you can potentially make greater returns, but it’s a lot of work. 
 Or, if you’re like me, why not both? This way, you get the best of both worlds: a bit of simple, reliable index investments and a bit of riskier, more complex, and more rewarding real estate investments.

<p>I’ve always been the sort of person who works with music in the background. Ever since I was a little kid writing code in my bedroom, I’d routinely listen to my favorite music while programming.</p>

<p>Over the last 12 years, as my responsibilities have shifted from purely writing code to writing articles, recording videos, and participating in meetings, my habits have changed. Out of necessity, I’m unable to work with music most of the time, but when I have an hour or so of uninterrupted time, I still prefer to put music on and use it to help me crank through whatever it is I’m focusing on.</p>

<p>However, I’ve been doing some experimentation over the last few months. My goal was to determine how much music helped me focus. I didn’t have a precise scientific way of measuring this except to track whether or not I felt my <a href="https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique">Pomodoro sessions</a> were productive.</p>

<p>To keep score, I kept a simple Apple Notes file that contained a running tally of whether or not I felt my recently finished Pomodoro session was productive or not. And while this isn’t the most scientific way to measure, I figured it was good enough for my purposes.</p>

<p>Over the last three months, I logged 120 completed Pomodoro sessions. Of those, roughly 50% (58 sessions) were completed while listening to music, and the other 50% (62 sessions) were completed without music.</p>

<p>To my surprise, when tallying up the results, it appears that listening to music is a distraction for me, causing me to feel like my sessions weren’t very productive. Out of the 58 Pomodoro sessions I completed while listening to music, I noted that ~20% were productive (12 sessions) vs. ~60% (37 sessions) without music.</p>

<p>60% vs. 20% is a significant difference, which is especially surprising since I genuinely enjoy working with music. When I started this experiment, I expected that music would make me more, not less productive.</p>

<p>So what’s the takeaway here? For me, it’s that despite how much I enjoy listening to music while working, it’s distracting.</p>

<p>Am I going to give up listening to music while trying to focus? Not necessarily. As I mentioned previously, I still love working with music. But, I’ll undoubtedly turn the music off if I’m trying to get something important done and need my time to be as productive as possible.</p>

<p>In the future, I’m also planning to run this experiment separately to compare the impact of instrumental vs. non-instrumental music on my productivity. I typically listen to music with lyrics (hip-hop, pop, etc.), which makes me wonder if the lyrics are distracting or just the music itself.</p>

<p>I’m also curious as to whether or not lyrics in a language I don’t understand would cause a similar level of distraction or not (for example, maybe I could listen to Spanish music without impacting my productivity since I don’t understand the language).</p>

<p>Regardless of my results, please experiment for yourself! If you’re trying to maximize productivity, you might be surprised what things are impacting your focus levels.</p>

This thought-piece asks if we know where our business biases start from and what direction of travel they create. Business bias is the bias you have right now that affects your choice, judgment and decision making. Business bais is something that our data cannot tell us. Data can tell me if your incentive removes choice or aligns with an outcome.&nbsp;</p><p>At the most superficial level, we know that the expectations of board members drive decisions.&nbsp; The decisions we take link to incentives, rewards and motivations and our shared values.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>If we unpack this simple model, we can follow (the blue arrows in the diagram below) that says your expectation builds shared values that focus/highlight the rewards and motivations (as a group) we want. These, in turn, drives new expectations.</p><p>However, equally, we could follow (the orange arrows) and observe that expectations search and align with rewards and motivations we are given; this exposes our shared values that create new expectations for us.&nbsp;</p><br><p></p><br><p>Whilst Individual bias is complex; board or group bias adds an element of continuous dynamic change. We have observed and been taught this based on the “forming storming norming performing” model of group development first proposed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Tuckman">Bruce Tuckman in 1965</a>, who said that these phases are all necessary and inevitable for a team to grow face up to challenges, tackle problems, find solutions, plan work, and deliver results.</p><br><p></p><p>The observation here is that whilst we might all follow the Tuckman ideals of “time”; in terms of the process to get to perfroming, of which there is lots of data to support, his model ignores the process of self-discovery we pass through during each phase, assuming that we align during the storming (conflicts and tensions) phase but ignore that we fundamentally have different approaches.&nbsp; Do you follow the blue of orange route and from where did you start.</p><p>This is non-more evident than when you get a “board with mixed experience”, in this case, the diversity of experience is a founder, family business and promoted leader. The reason is that if you add their starting positions to the map, we tend to find they start from different biased positions and may be travelling in different directions.&nbsp; Thank you to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/claudia-heimer-0057821/">Claudia Heimer</a> for stimulating this thought. &nbsp;The storming phase may align the majority round the team but will not change the underlying ideals and biases in the individuals, which means we don’t explose the paradoxes in decision making.&nbsp;</p><p></p><br><p>What does this all mean? As a CDO, we are tasked with finding data to support decisions? Often leadership will not follow the data, and we are left with questions. Equally, some leaders blindly follow the data without questioning it. Maybe it is time to collect smaller data at the board to uncover how we work and expose a bias in our decision making.</p><br><br><br><br>

 Seven Reflections Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@mango_quan?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Harry Quan</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a><p>On March 11, 2022, I was a panelist on The Metaverse: The Emperor’s New Clothes panel at the <a href="https://www.rebootcommunications.com/event/vipss-2022/">Vancouver International Privacy &amp; Security Summit</a>’s panel. Nik Badminton set the scene and led a discussion with myself, James Hursthouse and Kharis O’Connell. Here are seven reflections.</p>  Games are a playful way to explore who we are, to process and interact with people in a way we can’t do IRL. Games are a way to try on other identities, to create or adjust our mental map of the&nbsp;world.  Companies won’t protect me. I’m concerned we are not fully aware of the data that can be tracked with VR hardware. From a quantified self perspective, I would love to know more information about myself to be a better human; but I don’t trust companies. Companies will weaponize any scrap of data to manipulate you and I into buying something (advertising), and even believing something that isn’t true (disinformation).  Privacy for all. We need to shift thinking around privacy and security. It’s not something we each should individually have to fight for — for one of us to have privacy, all of us must have privacy. <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202201/the-metaverse-a-missed-opportunity-for-data-ownership-and-privacy">I wrote some longer thoughts in this&nbsp;article.</a>  Capitalism needs Commons. Capitalism can’t exist without a commons to exploit. And commons will dry up if they are not replenished or created anew. So we need to support the continuity and creation of commons. Governments traditionally are in the role of protecting commons. But people can come together to create common technological languages, like technology standards to enable interoperable technology “rails” that pave the way for an open marketplace.  We need new business models. The point of a business model is profit first. This bias has created the current set of problems. In order to solve the world’s problems, we must wean ourselves off profit as the primary objective. I’m not saying that making money isn’t important, it is. But profit at all costs is what has got us into the current set of world problems.  Appreciate the past. I’m worried too much knowledge about how we’ve done things in the past is being lost. But not everything needs to go into the future. Identify what has worked and keep doing it. Identify what hasn’t worked and iterate to improve on it. This is how you help build on the past and contribute to the&nbsp;future.  Things will fail. There is a lot of energy (and money) in the Metaverse, and I don’t see it going away. That said, there will be failures. If the experimentation fails, is that so bad? In order to understand what is possible, we have to venture a bit into the realm of what’s impossible.  <p>Watch the whole video for the thought-provoking conversation.</p><p>Thank you to Nik, Kharis, James and everyone at the Vancouver International Privacy &amp; Security&nbsp;Summit!</p>

I couldn’t help but be reminded of the letters written to the Battalion in 1935 by a freshman named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._Wright_Mills">C. Wright Mills</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>College students are supposed to become leaders of thought and action in later life. It is expected they will profit from a college education by developing an open and alert mind to be able to cope boldly with everyday problems in economics and politics. They cannot do this unless they learn to think independently for themselves and to stand fast for their convictions. Is the student at A and M encouraged to do this? Is he permitted to do it? The answer is sadly in the negative.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Little did he know that current students would be dealing with this shit 85 years later with a group of former students with nothing better to do than infiltrate student-run organizations from freshman orientation to the newspaper.  But shocking no one, they were too incompetent to maintain the privacy of the school regents who met with them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to meeting minutes from Dec. 1, 2020, the Rudder Association secured the attendance of four members of the A&amp;M System Board of Regents. The meeting minutes obtained by The Battalion were censored by TRA to remove the names of the regents in the meeting as well as other “highly sensitive information.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“DO NOT USE THEIR NAMES BEYOND THE RUDDER BOARD. They do not wish to be outed,” the minutes read on the regents in attendance.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Further examination by The Battalion revealed, however, that the censored text could be copied and pasted into a text document to be viewed in its entirety due to TRA using a digital black highlighter to censor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well done, Battalion.</p>

<p>If I try to find lies to expose them and share the truth, I’m a debunker
of lies.</p>
<p>And if I try to find the truth, and share it, that makes me a scientist.</p>
<p>If so, we can now describe each one of those categories in more detail, and
understand the specific behaviors they necessarily need to engage in.</p>
<p>For example, the scientist will welcome and produce copious objective evidence.
The demagogue, likely, will provide far less evidence, and if so, point to
other people and their statements as their evidence. Those other people are
likely either other demagogues or just crooks.</p>
<p>If we could annotate people on-line with these four categories, we could
even run a PageRank-style algorithm on it to figure out which is which.
Why aren’t we doing this? Might this interfere with attention as the
primary driver of revenue for “free” on-line services?</p>

<p>This week, <a href="https://twitter.com/tplooker">Tobias Looker</a> and I submitted two individual Internet Drafts for consideration by the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/cose/about/">COSE working group</a>.</p>
<p>The first is “<a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-looker-cose-bls-key-representations-00.html">Barreto-Lynn-Scott Elliptic Curve Key Representations for JOSE and COSE</a>“, the abstract of which is:</p>
<blockquote><p><br>
This specification defines how to represent cryptographic keys for the pairing-friendly elliptic curves known as Barreto-Lynn-Scott (BLS), for use with the key representation formats of JSON Web Key (JWK) and COSE (COSE_Key).<br>
</p></blockquote>
<p>These curves are used in Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) representations for JOSE and COSE, where the ZKPs use the CFRG drafts “<a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-irtf-cfrg-pairing-friendly-curves-10.html">Pairing-Friendly Curves</a>” and “<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-bls-signature-04">BLS Signatures</a>“.</p>
<p>The second is “<a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-looker-cose-cwt-claims-in-headers-00.html">CBOR Web Token (CWT) Claims in COSE Headers</a>“, the abstract of which is:</p>
<blockquote><p><br>
This document describes how to include CBOR Web Token (CWT) claims in the header parameters of any COSE structure. This functionality helps to facilitate applications that wish to make use of CBOR Web Token (CWT) claims in encrypted COSE structures and/or COSE structures featuring detached signatures, while having some of those claims be available before decryption and/or without inspecting the detached payload.<br>
</p></blockquote>
<p>JWTs define a mechanism for replicating claims as header parameter values, but CWTs have been missing the equivalent capability to date.  The use case is the same as that which motivated <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519.html#section-5.3">Section 5.3 of JWT</a> “Replicating Claims as Header Parameters” – encrypted CWTs for which you’d like to have unencrypted instances of particular claims to determine how to process the CWT prior to decrypting it.</p>
<p>We plan to discuss both with the COSE working group at <a href="https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/113/">IETF 113 in Vienna</a>.</p>

  Convergent Wisdom is utilizing the knowledge gained from studying multiple solutions that approach a similar outcome in different ways in order to choose the appropriate solution for the problem at hand.

<p>I was recently watching a MIT Opencourseware video on Youtube titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pb3z2w9gDg">“Introduction to ‘The Society of Mind’”</a> which is a series of lectures (or as the author refers to them “seminars”) by Marvin Minsky. While watching the first episode of this course the professors puts forth an interesting theory about what grants humans the capability to handle a variety of problems while machines remain limited in their capacity to generically compute solutions to problems. In this theory he alludes to the concept that humans “resourcefullness” is what grants us this capability which to paraphrase is the ability for humans to leverage a variety of different paths to identify a variety of solutions to the same problem. All of which can be used in a variety of different situations in order to develop a solution to the generic problem at hand. While he was describing this theory he made an <a href="https://youtu.be/-pb3z2w9gDg?t=1629">off hand comment</a> about the choice of the word “resourcefullness” positing whether there was a shorter word to describe the concept.</p>

<p>This got me thinking about the lingustical preciseness to describe the concept and I came across a <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/491254/word-describing-multiple-paths-to-the-same-abstract-outcome">very fullfilling suggestion</a> on stack exchange to do just that. They suggested the word “equifinality” which is incredibly precise, but also a bit of a pompous choice for a general audience. Albeit, great for the audience he was addressing. The second suggestion sent me down a tangent of thought that I find very enticing though. “Convergent” is a word that’s commonly used to describe this in common tongue today and more importantly can be paired with wisdom to describe a new concept. I’m choosing to define the concept of “convergent wisdom” as utilizing the knowledge gained from studying multiple solutions that approach the same outcome in different ways in order to choose the appropriate solution for the problem at hand.</p>

<p>What’s interesting about the concept of convergent wisdom is that it suitably describes the feedback loop that humans exploit in order to gain the capability of generalizable problem solving. For example, in chemical synthesis the ability to understand the pathway of creating an exotic compound is nearly as important as the compound itself because it can affect the feasiblity of mass production of the compound. In manufacteuring similarly, there are numerous instance of giant discoveries occuring (battery technology is the one that comes to mind first) which then fall short when it comes time to manufateur the product. In both of these instances the ability to understand the chosen path is nearly as important as the solution itself.</p>

<p>So why does this matter and why define the concept? This concept seems incredibly important to the ability to build generically intelligent machines. Today, it seems much of the focus of the artificial intelligence feild focuses primarily on the outcome while treating the process as a hidden and unimportant afterthought up until the point in which the algorithm starts to produce ethically dubious outcomes as well.</p>

<p>Through the study of not only the inputs and outputs, but also the pathway by with the outcome is achieved I believe the same feedback loop may be able to be formed to produce generalizable computing in machines. Unfortunately, I’m no expert in this space and have tons of reading to do on the topic. So now that I’ve been able to describe and define the topic can anyone point me to the area of study or academic literature which focuses on this aspect of AI?</p>

  Someone stole my Goodreads account; the company failed to recover it, then deleted it. It was all too preventable.

<p>On 12:31pm on February 2, I got an email from <a href="https://www.goodreads.com">Goodreads</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>This is a notice to let you know that the password for your account has been
changed.</p>
<p>If you did not recently reset or change your password, it is possible that
your account has been compromised. If you have any questions about this,
please reach out to us using our Contact Us form. Alternatively, visit
Goodreads Help.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since I had not changed my password, I immediately hit the “Goodreads Help” link
(not the one in the email, mind you) and reported the issue. At 2:40pm I wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I got an email saying my password had been changed. I did not change my
password. I went to the site and tried go log in, but the login failed. I
tried to reset my password, but got an email saying my email is not in the
system.</p>
<p>So someone has compromised the account. Please help me recover it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I also tried to log in, but failed. I tried the app on my phone, and had been
logged out there, too.</p>
<p>The following day at 11:53am, Goodreads replied asking me for a link to my
account. I had no idea what the link to my account was, and since I assumed that
all my information had been changed by the attackers, I didn’t think to search
for it.</p>
<p>Three minutes later, at 11:56, I replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No, I always just used the domain and logged in, or the iOS app. I’ve attached
the last update email I got around 12:30 EST yesterday, in case that helps.
I’ve also attached the email telling me my password had been changed around
2:30 yesterday. That was when I became aware of the fact that the account was
taken over.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A day and half later, at 5:46pm on the 4th, Goodreads support replied to say
that they needed the URL in order to find it and investigate and asked if I
remembered the name on the account. This seemed odd to me, since until at least
the February 2nd it was associated with my name and email address.</p>
<p>I replied 3 minutes later at 5:49:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The name is mine. The username maybe? I’m usually “theory”, “itheory”, or
“justatheory”, though if I set up a username for Goodreads it was ages ago
and never really came up. Where could I find an account link?</p>
<p>Over the weekend I can log into Amazon and Facebook and see if I see any old
integration messages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following day was Saturday the fifth. I logged into Facebook to see what I
could find. I had deleted the link to Goodreads in 2018 (when I also ceased to
use Facebook), but there was still a record of it, so I sent the link ID
Facebook had. I also pointed out that my email address had been associated with
the account for many years until it was changed on Feb 2. Couldn’t they find it
in the history for the account?</p>
<p>I still didn’t know the link to my account, but forwarded the marketing redirect
links that had been in the password change email, as well as an earlier email
with a status on my reading activity.</p>
<p>After I sent the email, I realized I could ask some friends who I knew followed
me on Goodreads to see if they could dig up the link. Within a few minutes my
pal Travis had sent it to me,
<code>https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7346356-david-wheeler</code>. I was surprised,
when I opened it, to see all my information there as I’d left it, no changes. I
still could not log in, however. I immediately sent the link to Goodreads
support (at 12:41pm).</p>
<p>That was the fifth. I did no hear back again until February 9th, when I was
asked if I could provide some information about the account so they could
confirm it was me. The message asked for:</p>
<blockquote>
 
 Any connected apps or devices 
 Pending friend requests to your account 
 Any accounts linked to your Goodreads account (Goodreads accounts can be
linked to Amazon, Apple, Google, and/or Facebook accounts) 
 The name of any private/secret groups of which you are a part 
 Any other account-specific information you can recall 
 
</blockquote>
<p>Since I of course had no access to the account, I replied 30 minutes later with
what information I could recall from memory: my devices, Amazon Kindle
connection (Kindle would sometimes update my reading progress, though not
always), membership in some groups that may or may not have been public, and the
last couple books I’d updated.</p>
<p>Presumably, most of that information was public, and the devices may have been
changed by the hackers. I heard nothing back. I sent followup inquiries on
February 12th and 16th but got no replies.</p>
<p>On February 23rd I <a href="https://twitter.com/theory/status/1496483369781243910">complained on Twitter</a>. Four minutes later <a href="https://twitter.com/goodreads/status/1496484238908178442">@goodreads
replied</a> and I started to hope there might be some progress again. They <a href="https://twitter.com/goodreads/status/1496513088224468992">asked
me</a> to get in touch with Support again, which <a href="https://twitter.com/theory/status/1496515177809944581">i did</a> at 10:59am, sending all
the previous information and context I could.</p>
<p>Then, at 12:38am, this bombshell arrived in my inbox from Goodreads support:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks for your your patience while we looked into this. I have found that
your account was deleted due to suspected suspicious activity. Unfortunately,
once an account has been deleted, all of the account data is permanently
removed from our database to comply with the data regulations which means that
we are unable to retrieve your account or the related data. I know that’s not
the news you wanted and I am sincerely sorry for the inconvenience.Please let
me know if there’s anything else I ​can assist you with.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was stunned. I mean of course there was suspicious activity, the account was
taken over 19 days previously! As of the 5th when I found the link it still
existed, and I had been in touch a number of times previously. Goodreads knew
that the account had been reported stolen and still deleted it?</p>
<p>And no chance of recovery due to compliance rules? I don’t live in the EU, and
even if I was subject to the <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu">GDPR</a> or <a href="https://www.oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">CCPA</a>, there is no provision to delete
my data unless I request it.</p>
<p>WTAF.</p>
<p>So to summarize:</p>
 
 Someone took control of my account on February 2 
 I reported it within hours 
 On February 5 my account was still on Goodreads 
 We exchanged a number of messages 
 By February 23 the account was deleted with no chance of recovery due to
suspicious activity 
 
<p>Because of course there was suspicious activity. I told them there was an issue!</p>
<p>How did this happen? What was the security configuration for my account?</p>
 
 I created an entry for Goodreads in 1Password on January 5, 2012. The
account may have been older than that, but for at least 10 years I’ve had
it, and used it semi-regularly. 
 The password was 16 random ASCII characters generated by 1Password on
October 27, 2018. I create unique random passwords for all of my accounts,
so it would not be found in a breached database (and I have updated all
breached accounts 1Password has identified). 
 The account had no additional factors of authentication or fallbacks to
something like SMS, because Goodreads does not offer them. There was only
my email address and password. 
 On February 2nd someone changed my password.  I had clicked no links in
emails, so phishing is unlikely. Was Goodreads support social-engineered to
let someone else change the password? How did this happen? 
 I exchanged multiple messages with Goodreads support between February 2 and
23rd, to no avail. By February 23rd, my account was gone with all my reviews
and reading lists. 
 
<p>Unlike <a href="https://www.somebits.com/weblog/" title="Some Bits: Nelson’s weblog">Nelson</a>, who’s <a href="https://www.somebits.com/weblog/tech/bad/goodreads-lost-all-my-data.html" title="Some Bits: “Goodreads lost all of my reviews”">account was also recently deleted</a> without chance of
recovery, I had not been making and backups of my data. Never occurred to me,
perhaps because I never put a ton of effort into my Goodreads account, mostly
just tracked reading and a few brief reviews. I’ll miss my reading list the
most. Will have to start a new one on my own machines.</p>
<p>Though all this, Goodreads support were polite but not particularly responsive.
days and then weeks went by without response. The company deleted the account
for suspicious activity an claim no path to recovery for the original owner.
Clearly the company doesn’t give its support people the tools they need to
adequately support cases such as this.</p>
<p>I can think of a number of ways in which these situations can be better handled
and even avoided. In fact, given my current job designing identity systems I’m
going to put a lot of thought into it.</p>
<p>But sadly I’ll be trusting third parties less with my data in the future.
Redundancy and backups are key, but so is adequate account protection.
<a href="https://letterboxd.com" title="Letterboxd • Social film discovery.">Letterboxed</a>, for example, has no multifactor authentication features, making
it vulnerable should someone decide it’s worthwhile to steal accounts to spam
reviews or try to artificially pump up the scores for certain titles. <a href="https://letterboxd.com/settings/data/">Just made
a backup</a>.</p>
<p>You should, too, and backup your Goodreads account regularly. Meanwhile, I’m on
the lookout for a new social reading site that supports multifactor
authentication. But even with that, in the future I’ll post reviews here on Just
a Theory and just reference them, at best, from social sites.</p>
 
<p>Update April 3, 2022: This past week, I finally got some positive news from
Goodreads, two months after this saga began:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Goodreads team would like to apologize for your recent poor experience
with your account. We sincerely value your contribution to the Goodreads
community and understand how important your data is to you. We have
investigated this issue and attached is a complete file of your reviews,
ratings, and shelvings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that’s it, along with some instructions for creating a new account and
loading the data. Still no account recovery, so my old URL is dead and there is
no information about my Goodreads friends. Still, I’m happy to at least have my
lists and reviews recovered. I imported them into a new Goodreads account, then
exported them again and imported them into my new <a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/itheory">StoryGraph profile</a>.</p>

  The editors have applied some minor updates to the OAuth DPoP specification in preparation for discussion at IETF 113 in Vienna. Updates made were: Renamed the always_uses_dpop client registration metadata parameter to dpop_bound_access_tokens.

  <p></p>

<p>2021 was a challenging year in many ways. Other than the global pandemic, many things changed in my life (some good, some bad), and it was a somewhat stressful year.</p>

<p>In March of 2021, I almost died due to a gastrointestinal bleed (a freak accident caused by a routine procedure). Luckily, I survived the incident due to my amazing wife calling 911 at the right time and the fantastic paramedics and doctors at my local hospital, but it was a terrifying ordeal.</p>

<p>While I was in recovery, I spent a lot of time thinking about what I wanted to do when feeling better. How I wanted to spend the limited time I have left. There are lots of things I want to spend my time doing: working on meaningful projects, having fun experiences with family and friends, going on camping and hiking trips, writing, etc.</p>

<p>The process of thinking through everything I wanted to do was, in and of itself, incredibly cathartic. The more time I spent reflecting on my thoughts and life, the better I felt. There’s something magical about taking dedicated time out of your day to write about your thoughts and consider the big questions seriously.</p>

<p>Without thinking much about it, I found myself journaling every day.</p>

<p>It’s been just about a year since I first started journaling, and since then, I’ve written almost every day with few exceptions. In this time, journaling has made a tremendous impact on my life, mood, and relationships. Journaling has quickly become the most impactful of all the habits I’ve developed over the years.</p>

 Benefits of Journaling 

<p>There are numerous reasons to journal, but these are the primary benefits I’ve personally noticed after a year of journaling.</p>

<p>Journaling helps clear your mind.</p>

<p>I have a noisy inner monologue, and throughout the day, I’m constantly being interrupted by ideas, questions, and concerns. When I take a few minutes each day to write these thoughts down and think through them, it puts my brain at ease and allows me to relax and get them off my mind.</p>

<p>Journaling helps put things in perspective.</p>

<p>I’ve often found myself upset or frustrated about something, only to realize later in the day while writing about how insignificant the problem is. The practice of writing things down brings a certain level of rationality to your thoughts that aren’t always immediately apparent.</p>

<p>I often discover that even the “big” problems in my life have obvious solutions I would never have noticed had I not journaled about them.</p>

<p>Journaling preserves memories.</p>

<p>My memory is terrible. If you asked me what I did last month, I’d have absolutely no idea.</p>

<p>Before starting a journal, the only way I could reflect on memories was to look through photos. The only problem with this is that often, while I can remember bits and pieces of what was going on at the time, I can’t remember everything.</p>

<p>As I’m writing my daily journal entry, I’ll include any relevant photos and jot down some context around them – I’ve found that by looking back through these entries with both pictures and stories, it allows me to recall everything.</p>

<p>And… As vain as it is, I hope that someday I’ll be able to pass these journals along to family members so that, if they’re interested, they can get an idea of what sort of person I was, what I did, and the types of things I thought about.</p>

<p>Journaling helps keep your goals on track.</p>

<p>It’s really easy to set a personal goal and forget about it – I’ve done it hundreds of times. But, by writing every day, I’ve found myself sticking to my goals more than ever.</p>

<p>I think this boils down to focus. It would be hard for me to journal every day without writing about my goals and how I’m doing, and that little bit of extra focus and attention goes a long way towards helping me keep myself honest.</p>

<p>It’s fun!</p>

<p>When I started journaling last year, I didn’t intend to do it every day. It just sort of happened.</p>

<p>Each day I found myself wanting to write down some thought or idea, and the more I did it, the more I enjoyed it. Over time, I noticed that I found myself missing it on the few occasions I didn’t journal.</p>

<p>Now, a year in, I look forward to writing a small journal entry every day. It’s part of my wind-down routine at night, and I love it.</p>

 Keeping a Digital and Physical Journal 

<p>Initially, when I started keeping a journal, I had a few simple goals:</p>

 
 I wanted to be able to quickly write (and ideally include photos) in my journal 
 I wanted it to be easy to write on any device (phone, laptop, iPad, etc.) 
 I wanted some way to physically print my journal each year so that I could have a physical book to look back at any time I want – as well as to preserve the memories as digital stuff tends to disappear eventually 
 

<p>With these requirements in mind, I did a lot of research, looking for a suitable solution. I looked at various journaling services and simple alternatives (physical journals, Google Docs, Apple Notes, etc.).</p>

<p>In the end, I decided to start using the <a href="https://dayoneapp.com/">Day One Mac app</a> (works on all Apple devices). I cannot recommend it highly enough if you’re an Apple user.</p>

<p>NOTE: I have no affiliation whatsoever with the Day One app. But it’s incredible.</p>

<p>The Day One app looks beautiful, syncs your journals privately using iCloud, lets you embed photos (and metadata) into entries in a stylish and simple way, makes it incredibly easy to have multiple journals (by topic), track down any entries you’ve previously created, and a whole lot more.</p>

<p></p>

<p>For me, the ultimate feature is the ability to easily create a beautiful looking physical journal whenever I want. Here’s a picture of my journal from 2021.</p>

<p></p>

<p>It’s a bound book with high-quality photos, layouts, etc. It looks astounding. You can customize the book’s cover, include select entries, and make a ton of other customizations I won’t expand on here.</p>

<p>So, my recommendation is that if you’re going to start a journal and want to print it out eventually, use the <a href="https://dayoneapp.com/">Day One app</a> – it’s been absolutely 10⁄10 incredible.</p>

    Ethics, maturity and incentives may not appear obvious or natural bedfellows.&nbsp; However, if someone else’s incentives drive you, you are likely on a journey from immaturity to Peak Paradox.&nbsp; A road from Peak Paradox towards a purpose looks like maturity as your own incentives drive you. Of note, ethics change depending on the direction of travel.&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>----</p><p>In psychology, maturity can be operationally defined as the level of psychological functioning one can attain, after which the level of psychological functioning no longer increases with age.&nbsp; Maturity is the state, fact, or period of being mature.</p><p>Whilst immature is not fully developed or has an emotional or intellectual development appropriate to someone younger, I want to use the state of immaturity, which is the state where one is not fully mature.&nbsp;</p><p>Incentives are a thing that motivates or encourages someone to do something.</p><p>Peak Paradox is where you try to optimise for everything but cannot achieve anything as you do not know what drives you and are constantly conflicted.&nbsp;</p><p>Ethics is a branch of philosophy that "involves systematising, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong behaviour".&nbsp; Ethical and moral principles govern a person's behaviour.</p><br><p>The Peak Paradox framework is below.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br><p>When we start our life journey, we travel from being immature to mature.&nbsp; Depending on your context, e.g. location, economics, social, political and legal, you will naturally be associated with one of the four Peak Purposes. It might not be extreme, but you will be framed towards one of them (bias).&nbsp; This is the context you are in before determining your own purpose, mission or vision.&nbsp; Being born in a place with little food and water, there is a natural affinity to survival.&nbsp; Being born in a community that values everyone and everything, you will naturally align to a big society.&nbsp; Born to the family of a senior leader in a global industry, you will be framed to a particular model.&nbsp; Being a child of Murdoch, Musk, Zuckerberg, Trump, Putin, Rothschild, Gates,&nbsp; etc. - requires assimilation to a set of beliefs.&nbsp;</p><p>Children of celebrities break from what the parents thinking, as have we and as do our children.&nbsp; Politics and religious chats with teenagers are always enlightening. As children, we travel from the contextual purpose we are born into and typically head towards reaching Peak Paradox - on this journey, we are immature. (note, it is possible to go the other way and become more extreme in purpose than your parents.)&nbsp; Later in life and with the benefits of maturity, we observe this journey from the simplicity of binary choices (black and white ethics) towards a more nuanced mess at Peak Paradox. At Peak Paradox, we sense a struggle to make sense of the different optimisations, drivers, purposes, incentives, rewards that others have.&nbsp; This creates anxiety, tension and conflict within us. During this journey from a given purpose to Peak Paradox, the incentives given to you are designed to maintain the original purpose, to keep you following that ideal.&nbsp; Incentive frame and keep us in a model which is sometimes hard to break.</p><p></p><p>It is only when we live with complexity and are able to appreciate others' purposes, optimisations, and drivers that we will also gain clarity on our own passion, purpose or mission. By living with Peak Paradox, we change from being driven by others' incentives to uncovering our own affinity; this is where we start to align to what we naturally believe in and find what fits our skin.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>I have written before that we have to move from <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/post/questions-to-help-frame-your-own-paradoxes">Peak Paradox towards a purpose if we want to have clarity of purpose and achieve something</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Enter Ethics</p><p>Suppose maturity is the transition from our actions being determined by others and following their ethical or moral code to determining what type of world or society we want to be part of. In that case, we need to think about the two journeys.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>On the route from birth to Peak Paradox, I have framed this as a route from immaturity to living with complexity.&nbsp; On the route in, we live by others' moral and ethical codes and are driven by their incentives. &nbsp; As we leave Peak Paradox and head to a place where we find less tension, conflicts and anxiety, which has a natural affinity to what we believe, and we create our own moral and ethical compass/ code and become driven by our own motivations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We should take a fresh perspective on ethics and first determine which direction someone is heading before we make a judgement.&nbsp; This is increasingly important in #cyberethics and #digitalethics as we only see the point and have no ability to create a bearing or direction.</p><p>The purpose of Peak Paradox</p><p>As maturity heads towards being mature, we move in and out of living at Peak Paradox from different “Purposes” I am sure this is an iterative process.&nbsp; The purpose of Peak Paradox is to be in a place where you are comfortable with complexity, but it is not a place to stay. It is like a holiday home, good to go there now and again, but it does not represent life.&nbsp; The question we have is how do we know when we are at Peak Paradox, probably because our <a href="https://opengovernance.net/how-do-you-recognise-when-your-north-star-has-become-a-black-hole-c3f0a759fb5">north star has become a black hole</a>!&nbsp; The key message here is that some never escape the Peak Paradox black hole, finding they live in turmoil driven by others' incentives that are designed to keep you there) and never finding their own passion, incentive or motivation.&nbsp; The complexity death vortex is where you endlessly search for a never reachable explanation of everything as it is all too interconnected and interdependent to unravel. Leaders come out from Peak Paradox knowing why they have a purpose and a direction.&nbsp;</p><p>The Journey</p><p>Imagine you are born into a celebrity household, over time you see the world is more complicated,&nbsp; you work for a company believing that money bonuses and incentives matter.&nbsp; Over time you come to understand the tensions such a narrow view brings.&nbsp; You search for something better, committing to living a simpler life, changing your ethics and moral code.&nbsp; This still creates tension, and you search for peace and harmony, where you find less tension and more alignment; when you arrive there, you have a unique code because you live with complexity and understand different optimisations.&nbsp; It does not scale, and few can grasp your message.</p><p></p><br><p>Where are you on the journey?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><br><br>

<p>A new draft of the OAuth 2.0 Demonstration of Proof-of-Possession at the Application Layer (DPoP) specification has been published that addresses four months’ worth of great review comments from the working group.  Refinements made were:</p>
 
 Added Authorization Code binding via the <code>dpop_jkt</code> parameter. 
 Described the authorization code reuse attack and how <code>dpop_jkt</code> mitigates it. 
 Enhanced description of DPoP proof expiration checking. 
 Described nonce storage requirements and how nonce mismatches and missing nonces are self-correcting. 
 Specified the use of the <code>use_dpop_nonce</code> error for missing and mismatched nonce values. 
 Specified that authorization servers use <code>400</code> (Bad Request) errors to supply nonces and resource servers use <code>401</code> (Unauthorized) errors to do so. 
 Added a bit more about <code>ath</code> and pre-generated proofs to the security considerations. 
 Mentioned confirming the DPoP binding of the access token in the list in (#checking). 
 Added the <code>always_uses_dpop</code> client registration metadata parameter. 
 Described the relationship between DPoP and Pushed Authorization Requests (PAR). 
 Updated references for drafts that are now RFCs. 
 
<p>I believe this brings us much closer to a final version.</p>

I am writing about becoming lost on a journey as I emerge from working from home, travel restrictions, lockdowns and masks; to find nothing has changed, but everything has changed.</p><p>The hope of a shake or wake up call from something so dramatic as a global pandemic is immediately lost as we re-focus on how to pay for the next meal, drink, ticket, bill, rent, mortgage, school fee or luxury item. Have you become so wedded to an economic model that we cannot see that we will not get to our imagined NorthStar?</p><p>I feel right now that I have gone into a culdesac and cannot find the exit. The road I was following had a shortcut, but my journey planner had a shortcut that assumed I was walking and could hop over the gate onto the public path and not the reality that I was in my car.</p><p>I wrote about “<a href="https://opengovernance.net/the-new-fatigue-what-is-this-all-about-d718a48a4653">The New Fatigue — what is this all about</a>?” back in Feb 2021. I could not pinpoint how I was productive, maintained fitness, and ate well, but something was missing — human contact and social and chemistry-based interactions. I posted a view about the<a href="https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/2020/09/describing-our-response-to-covid.html"> 7 B’s and how we were responding to a global pandemic</a>; we lost #belonging. I wrote more on this under a post about<a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/post/isolation-the-8th-deadly-sin"> Isolation — the 8th deadly sin</a>.</p><p>Where am I going with this? Because we want a radical change masked as a “<a href="https://opengovernance.net/lockdown-one-year-in-and-i-now-question-what-is-a-better-normal-9c01790a0860">New Normal, something better</a>”, but we are already finding nothing has actually changed on the journey we have been on, and I am now questioning that the bright north star I had lost its sparkle!</p><p>I have used heuristics and rules to help me for the longest time; anyone on the neuro-diverse spectrum has to have them because without them surviving becomes exhausting. However, these shortcuts (when created and learnt) also mean I stopped questioning why. Now that the very fabric that set up my heuristics has changed, those rules don’t necessarily work or apply. We love a shortcut because it gets us out of trouble, we love the quick route because it works, we love an easy known trusted route because we don’t have to think. We use them all the time in business to prioritise. “What is the ROI on this?” In truth, we either don’t have the resources or cannot be bothered to spend the time to look in detail, so we use the blunt tool (ROI) to make a decision.</p><p>My tools don’t work (as well or at all)</p><p>I found my NorthStar with my tools. I was navigating to the north star with my tools. My tools did not tell me I was heading past a black hole that could suck me in. I am not sensing I am lost as my tools are not telling me; all the things we did pre-pandemic don’t work as well on the other side — but nothing other than feeling lost is telling me this. We have not gone back to everything working and still have not created enough solid ground to build new rules, so we are now lost, looking for a new NorthStar with tools that do not work.</p><p>Our shortcuts sucked us in and took away the concept that we need to dwell, be together, work it out, and take time. Our tools and shortcuts reduced our time frames and tricked us into thinking they would work forever. The great quote from Anthony Zhou below assumes you know where you are going. That is not true.</p><p>How do I recognise that my north star has become a black hole because my shortcuts and rules no longer work, creating fatigue I cannot describe, and I feel lost? There is a concept of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring_%28cognitive_bias%29"> anchor points</a> in philosophy, and it is a cognitive bias. When you lose your anchor in a harbour, you drift (ignoring sea anchors for those who sail). The same can be said when you lose your own personal anchor points that have provided the grounding for your decision making. Routines and experience are not anchor points. But the pandemic looks to have cut the ties we had to anchor points, so we feel all somewhat lost and drifting. The harder we try to re-apply the old rules, the more frustrated we become that nothing works. Perhaps it is time to make some new art such that we can discover the new rules and find some new anchor points. Then, maybe I will feel less lost?</p><p><br></p>

   <p>Whilst our universe is full of hostile places, and they are engaging in their own right, I want to unpack the thinking and use naturally occurring hostile environments as an analogy to help unpack complex decision making in hostile to non-hostile work environments.</p><p>----</p><p>I enjoyed reading<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragile_(book)"> Anti-Fragile</a> in 2013; it is the book about things that gain from disorder by<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb"> Nassim Nicholas Taleb</a>. "Some things benefit from shocks; they thrive and grow when exposed to volatility,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness"> randomness</a>, disorder, and stressors and love adventure,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"> risk</a>, and<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty"> uncertainty</a>. Yet, in spite of the ubiquity of the phenomenon, there is no word for the exact opposite of fragile. Let us call it antifragile. Antifragility is beyond resilience or robustness. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better." When writing this, I have the same problem looking for a direct opposite of a Hostile Environment, as in an extreme ecosystem (ecology),&nbsp; and whilst I have opted for a non-hostile environment, anti-hostile would be better.</p><p>&nbsp;In nature, a hostile or<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_environment"> extreme environment</a> is a habitat characterised by harsh environmental conditions, beyond the optimal range for the development of humans, for example, pH 2 or 11, −20°C or 113°C, saturating salt concentrations, high radiation, 200 bars of pressure, among others.&nbsp; These hostile places are super interesting because life is possible, and it is from what life emerged. I will extend the thinking and use this as an analogy to help unpack complex decision making by comparing hostile to non-hostile, extreme to amicable.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Time apparently moves more slowly than in a non-hostile environment than in a hostile environment.&nbsp; Time, in this case, is about the period between change.&nbsp; Change in a hostile environment is challenging and has to be done in tiny steps over a long period of time. Rapid change increases the risk of death and non-survival. &nbsp; To survive in a hostile environment, the living thing needs stability and resilience.&nbsp; The processes (chemistry) methods (biology) must be finely adjusted to become incredibly efficient and effective - efficacy matters. Change is incremental and very slow.&nbsp; To survive, sharing is a better option; having facts (data) matters, you survive together, and there are few paradoxes. Of note is that hostile environments will become less hostile. As it moved from an acidic creation to our current diversity, the earth is worthy of note.</p><p>In a non-hostile environment, time can move fast between iteration/ adaptation.&nbsp; The risk of a change leading to death is lower as the environment is tolerant of change. &nbsp; The jumps can be more significant with fewer threats.&nbsp; Because the environment has a wide tolerance, it is less sensitive to risk (5 sigma deviation is acceptable); therefore, you can have large scale automation, programmable algorithms and less finely tuned processes, methods and rules.&nbsp; Innovation and change will come thick and fast as the environment is amiable and amicable.&nbsp; The time between this innovation and adaptation is fast. &nbsp; The environment creates more volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity. &nbsp; Politics and power focus on control over survival.&nbsp; The world is full of paradoxes.&nbsp; Non-hostile environments will become more hostile.&nbsp;</p><p>----</p><p>Yes, there are problems will all analogies, and this one breaks down; however, there is a principle here worth thinking about.&nbsp; In hostile environments, there are fewer paradoxes. &nbsp; I would argue that this is because survival is one driving purpose.&nbsp; Survival is one of the four-opposing purposes in the peak-paradox model.&nbsp; &nbsp; In non-hostile environments, you can optimise for more than one thing.&nbsp; Indeed you can have many purposes all competing.&nbsp; This leads to many paradoxes. &nbsp; In work environments where senior leadership is unable to comprehend paradoxes, I also observe hostile environments (different to natural ones but just as toxic).&nbsp; Where I find teams that embrace VUCA, innovation, change and can see the paradoxes in their data, facts and knowledge;&nbsp; observe congenial, amenable, non-hostile and anti-hostile environments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The key here is not this observation but about direction.&nbsp; Knowing which camp you are in is essential, but so too is knowing the direction. How to measure Peak-Hostility is going to be another post. Non-hostile places tend to become more hostile because of politics and power dynamics; dealing with paradoxes is hard work.&nbsp; Because they demand working together and clarity of purpose, hostile environments can become less hostile.</p><p>If we plot this thinking on the Peak Pardox framework, I believe it will be difficult to escape the dynamics of Peak Human Purpose (survival) until scarcity is resolved.&nbsp; At Peak Individual Purpose, the few will control, but this creates a hostile environment for the majority.&nbsp; Peak Work, we observe fierce competition between the two camps, where hostile can win by focussing on costs, but non-hostile wins through innovation.&nbsp; At Peak Society Purpose - there is something unique as non-hostile could lead to anti-hostile.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>As to decision-making, what becomes critical is whether your decision-making processes match your (hostile/ non-hostile) environment and direction, as they demand very different approaches.&nbsp; Hostile, in many ways, is more straightforward as there is a much more defined purpose to which decisions can be aligned.&nbsp; Non-hostile introduce paradoxes, optimisation and complexity into the processes with many interested stakeholders.&nbsp; If there is a mismatch in methods, this can be destructive—much more to think about.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br>

<p>Recently, we and a number of our neighbors have been noticing our lights flickering in the evening and early morning. While we have considered it to be mostly an annoyance, this has bothered some of our neighbors enough that they have opened cases with the utility and began raising the issue on our street mailing list.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.pge.com">Pacific Gas and Electric</a> (PG&amp;E) responded to these customers with a visit, and in some cases replaced the service entrance cable to the home. In at least one case PG&amp;E also said they might need to replace the pole transformer, which would take a few months to complete. I have heard no reports that these efforts have made any difference.</p>



<p>This <a href="https://altmode.org/2020/09/08/line-voltage-fluctuations/">isn’t our first recent challenge</a> with voltage regulation in our neighborhood. Our most recent issue was a longer-term voltage regulation problem that occurred on hot days, apparently due to load from air conditioners and the fact that our neighborhood is fed by older 4-kilovolt service from the substation. This is different, and raised several questions:</p>



  How local are the anomalies? Are neighbors on different parts of the street seeing the same anomalies, or are they localized to particular pole transformers or individual homes?  What is the duration and nature of the anomalies?  Are they only happening in the evening and early morning, or do we just notice them at these times?  



<p>To try to answer these questions, I found a test rig that I built several years ago when we were noticing some dimming of our lights, apparently due to neighbors’ air conditioners starting on summer evenings. The test rig consists of a pair of filament transformers: 110 volt to 6 volt transformers that were used in equipment with electronic tubes, which typically used 6 volts to heat the tube’s filament. The transformers are connected in cascade to reduce the line voltage to a suitable level for the line-in audio input on a computer. An open-source audio editing program, <a href="https://www.audacityteam.org/">Audacity</a>, is used to record the line voltage. I often joke that this is a very boring recording: mostly just a continuous 60 hertz tone.</p>



<p>At the same time, I started recording the times our lights flickered (or my uninterruptable power supply clicked, another symptom). I asked my neighbors to record when they see their lights flicker and report that back to me.</p>



<p>I created a collection of 24-hour recordings of the power line, and went looking for the reported power anomalies. It was a bit of a tedious process, because not everyone’s clocks are exactly synchronized. But I was successful in identifying several power anomalies that were observed by neighbors on opposite ends of the street (about three blocks). Here’s a typical example:</p>



<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2022/02/powerglitch.png"></a>Typical power anomaly



<p>As you can see, the problem is very short in duration, about 60 milliseconds or so.</p>



<p>I was getting a lot of flicker reports, and as I mentioned, searching for these anomalies was tedious. So I began looking at the analysis capabilities of Audacity. I noticed a <a href="https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/silence_finder.html">Silence Finder</a> plug-in and attempted to search for the anomalies using that tool. But Silence Finder is designed to find the kind of silence that one might find between tracks on an LP: very quiet for a second or so. Not surprisingly, Silence Finder didn’t find anything for me.</p>



<p>I noticed that Silence Finder is written in a specialized Lisp-like signal processing language known as <a href="https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/nyquist.html">Nyquist</a>. So I had a look at the source code, which is included with Audacity, and was able to understand quite a bit of what was going on. For efficiency reasons, Silence Finder down-samples the input data so it doesn’t have to deal with as much data. In order to search for shorter anomalies, I needed to change that, as well as the user interface limits on minimum silence duration. Also, the amplitude of the silence was expressed in dB, which makes sense for audio but I needed more sensitivity to subtle changes in amplitude. So I changed the silence amplitude from dB to a linear voltage value.</p>



<p>The result was quite helpful. The modified plug-in, which I called “Glitch Finder”, was able to quite reliably find voltage anomalies. For example:</p>



<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2022/02/20220129-170512-1.png"></a>Power recording 1/29/2022-1/30/2022



<p>The label track generated by Glitch Finder points out the location of the anomalies (at 17:05:12, 23:00:12, and 7:17:56 the next morning), although they’re not visible at this scale. Zoom in a few times and they become quite obvious:</p>



<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2022/02/20220130-071756.png"></a>Power anomaly at 1/30/2022 7:17:56



<p>Thus far I have reached these tentative conclusions:</p>



  The power problems are primarily common to the neighborhood, and unlikely to be caused by a local load transient such as plugging an electric car in.  They seem to be concentrated mainly in the evening (4-11 pm) and morning (6-10 am). These seem to be times when power load is changing, due to heating, cooking, lighting, and home solar power systems going off and on at sunset and sunrise.  The longer term voltage goes up or down a bit at the time of a power anomaly. This requires further investigation, but may be due to switching activity by the utility.  



 Further work 



<p>As usual, a study like this often raises new questions about as quickly as it answers questions. Here are a few that I’m still curious about.</p>



  What is the actual effect on lights that causes people to notice these anomalies so easily? I currently have an oscilloscope connected to a photoelectric cell, set to trigger when the lights flash. It will be interesting to see how that compares with the magnitude of the anomaly.  Do LED lights manifest this more than incandescent bulbs? It seems unlikely that such a short variation would affect the filament temperature of an incandescent bulb significantly.  Do the anomalies correlate with any longer-term voltage changes? My test rig measures long-term voltage in an uncalibrated way, but the processing I’m currently doing doesn’t make it easy to look at longer-term voltage changes as well.

   <blockquote> The fight against "Bureaucratic Supremacy" affects us all. Time for unity beyond the dysfunctional cult politics driving people apart from their independence. </blockquote> Words are thinking tools; used wrongly, contrived inappropriately, disseminated poorly, words can cause great harm to people and society. This is being demonstrated for all people to witness in 2020++ <br>  History is long; let the dead past bury its dead. You are here, now, and the structure of your participation in this life, the administration of your Rights in civil society, matters a great deal for the results both are capable of rendering.  <br>  "We the people" is an example of how words crafted by intent, can be manipulated over time to render outcomes out-of-step with their original intent. Once upon a time.. "people" was an easy word to define. An experiment in self-governance, unique in all the world and history, arrived because people made it so. Fast forward to 2022, and people no longer function as "people" under the law; in lieu of basic observable fact, a bureaucratic interpretation and abstraction of intent has been allowed to take root among people.  <br>  Oft confused in 2020++ with phrases like "white supremacy", or "Institutional racism", methods of administrative bureaucracy have taken a supreme role in defining and operationalizing Rights defined for "people". This "bureaucratic supremacy" has allowed abstraction of words like "people" to render a Government operated by bureaucrats, not under the authority of the people "of, by, for" whom it was originally conceived and instantiated, but instead under methods of processing bureaucratic intent. From the point-of-view of the oppressed historically, the bureaucracy has skin in the game, and domination is absolute. But, from the point-of-view of the unexperienced future derived "of, by, for" people, skin has nothing to do with it. History's leverage is one of administrative origin.  <br>  Pandemics will come and go in time; experiences of the administrative machinery that guarantees the integrity, security and continued self-governance of society by people should never be overlooked. Especially in the context of now "computational" Constitutional Rights for people, (not birth certificates - vaccination passport holders - or ID verification methods &amp; artifacts poorly designed) where operational structure determines the integrity of operational run time results. Literature might say "Freedom of Speech" is a Right, but if the administrative system does not compute said Rights, then they cease to exist.&nbsp;  <br>  "Bureaucratic Supremacy" has a predictable moat surrounding its practices; credentialed labor. Employees with labor certifications are only as useful as the validity of the credential under inspection and in practice. Administering the permission to be hired, work, contribute value and extend a meaningful voice into a civil system is easily sequestered if/when that credential is meaningless under inspection, and is only used as means of identifying bureaucratic compliance.  <br>  Bureaucratic supremacy is the direct result of bureaucratic compliance; people, functioning as "people" willing to cede their inalienable rights in exchange for a paycheck, yield a systemic approach to human management that often counters the initial intent and integrity of a systems existence. Often heard when something happens that lacks systemic integrity, "I was only doing my job" represents an output of bureaucratic fraud, whereby people claim plausible deniability of responsibility and accountability based on the structure of their working efforts. Corporate law is founded on the premise of "liability control", whereby a resulting bureaucracy allows real human choices to function as bureaucratic outcomes lacking any real direct human definition. People are no longer operating as "people" when abstracted by the law in such ways, and the world over, systems of bureaucracy with historic significance control and confuse the interpretation of results that such a system of labor induces.  <br>  Rooted at the origin of a self-governed civil society is an original act of human Sovereignty. In America, this act is writ large by John Hancock for a King's benefit, as well as every administrative bureaucracy the world will ever come to experience. People declare independence from bureaucracies by personal Sovereign authority. This is the <a href="https://www.moxytongue.com/2012/02/what-is-sovereign-source-authority.html">root of Sovereign authority</a>, and can never be provisioned by a bureaucracy. Bureaucratic supremacy is a perversion of this intent, and labor credentials make it so.  <br>  Where do "we" go from here?  <br>  People, Individuals all, is the only living reality of the human species that will ever actually exist. People, living among one another, never cease to function as Individuals, and any systemic process that uses a literary abstraction, or computational abstraction to induce "we" into a bureaucratic form is an aggressive act of fraud against Humanity, and the Sovereignty defined "of, by, for" such people.  <br>  In America, people are not the dog of their Government; self-governance is man's best friend. The order of operations in establishing such a "more perfect Union" is critical for its sustained existence. Be wary of listening to lifetime bureaucrats; they will speak with words that are no longer tools for human advancement, but instead, are designed to reinforce the "bureaucratic supremacy" of the authority derived by their labor credentials. Inspect those credentials directly to ensure they are legitimate, for false labor credentials are endemic.  <br>  Structure yields results; fraud by bureaucracy and Rights for people are juxtapositional and never exist in the same place at the same time.&nbsp;  <br>  Think About It.. More Individuals in Civil Society Needed:&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/KHbzSif78qQ">https://youtu.be/KHbzSif78qQ</a>  <br>  <br>

<p>I’ve worked from home since 1998. All along I’ve hoped many more people would enjoy the privilege and share in the benefits. Now that it’s finally happening, and seems likely to continue in some form, let’s take a moment to reflect on an underappreciated benefit: neighborhood revitalization. </p>
<p>I was a child of the 1960s, and spent my grade school years in a newly-built suburb of Philadelphia. Commuter culture was well established by then, so the dads in the neighborhood were gone during the day. So were some of the moms, mine included, but many were at home and were able to keep an eye on us kids as we played in back yards after school. And our yards were special. A group of parents had decided not to fence them, thus creating what was effectively a private park. The games we played varied from season to season but always involved a group of kids roaming along that grassy stretch. Nobody was watching us most of the time. Since the kitchens all looked out on the back yards, though, there was benign surveillance. Somebody’s mom might be looking out at any given moment, and if things got out of hand, somebody’s mom would hear that. </p>
<p>For most kids, a generation later, that freedom was gone. Not for ours, though! They were in grade school when BYTE Magazine ended and I began my remote career. Our house became an after-school gathering place for our kids and their friends. With me in my front office, and Luann in her studio in the back, those kids enjoyed a rare combination of freedom and safety. We were mostly working, but at any given moment we could engage with them in ways that most parents never could. </p>
<p>I realized that commuter culture had, for several generations, sucked the daytime life out of neighborhoods. What we initially called telecommuting wasn’t just a way to save time, reduce stress, and burn less fossil fuel. It held the promise of restoring that daytime life.</p>
<p>All this came back to me powerfully at the height of the pandemic lockdown. Walking around the neighborhood on a weekday afternoon I’d see families hanging out, kids playing, parents working on landscaping projects and tinkering in garages, neighbors talking to one another. This was even better than my experience in the 2000s because more people shared it.</p>
<p>Let’s hold that thought. Even if many return to offices on some days of the week, I believe and hope that we’ve normalized working from home on other days. By inhabiting our neighborhoods more fully on weekdays, we can perhaps begin to repair a social fabric frayed by generations of commuter culture.</p>
<p>Meanwhile here is a question to ponder. Why do we say that we are working from and not working at home?</p>

<p>I’m a bit of a sustainability nerd. I love the idea of living a life where your carbon footprint is neutral (or negative) and you leave the world a better place than it was before you got here.</p>

<p>While it’s clear that there’s only <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions">so much impact</a> an individual can have on carbon emissions, I like the idea of working to minimize my personal carbon footprint. This is a big part of the reason why I live in a home with solar power, drive an electric vehicle, and try to avoid single-use plastics as much as possible.</p>

<p>During a recent impact-focused hackathon at <a href="https://snyk.io">work</a> (<a href="https://snyk.io/careers/">come work with me!</a>), I found myself working on an interesting sustainability project. Our team’s idea was simple: because almost all Snyk employees work remotely using a Mac laptop, could we measure the energy consumption of every employee’s Mac laptop to better understand how much energy it takes to power employee devices, as well as the amount of carbon work devices produce?</p>

<p>Because we know (on average) <a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=74&amp;t=11">how much carbon</a> it takes to produce a single kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity in the US (0.85 pounds of CO2 emissions per kWh), if we could figure out how many kWh of electricity were being used by employee devices, we’d be able to do some simple math and figure out two things:</p>

 
 How much energy is required to power employee devices 
 How much carbon is being put into the atmosphere by employee devices 
 

<p>Using this data, we could then donate money to a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/best-carbon-offset-programs-5114611">carbon offsetting service</a> to “neutralize” the impact of our employee’s work devices.</p>

<p>PROBLEM: Now, would this be a perfectly accurate way of measuring the true carbon impact of employees? Absolutely not – there are obviously many things we cannot easily measure (such as the amount of energy of attached devices, work travel, food consumption, etc.), but the idea of being able to quantify the carbon impact of work laptops was still interesting enough that we decided to pursue it regardless.</p>

 Potential Energy Tracking Solutions 

<p>The first idea we had was to use smart energy monitoring plugs that employees could plug their work devices into while charging. These plugs could then store a tally of how much energy work devices consume, and we could aggregate that somewhere to get a total amount of energy usage.</p>

<p>I happen to have several of the <a href="https://www.evehome.com/en/eve-energy">Eve Energy</a> smart plugs around my house (which I highly recommend if you use Apple’s HomeKit) that I’ve been using to track my personal energy usage for a while now.</p>

<p></p>

<p>While these devices are incredible (they work well, come with a beautiful app, etc.), unfortunately, they don’t have any sort of publicly accessible API you can use to extract energy consumption data.</p>

<p>We also looked into various other types of smart home energy monitoring plugs, including the <a href="https://amzn.to/341CXQt">Kasa Smart Plug Mini</a>, which does happen to have <a href="https://github.com/python-kasa/python-kasa">an API</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, however, because Snyk is a global company with employees all over the world, hardware solutions were looking less and less appealing as to do what we wanted, we’d need to:</p>

 
 Ship country-specific devices to each new and existing employee 
 Include setup instructions for employees (how to configure the plugs, how to hook them up to a home network, etc.) 
 Instruct employees to always plug their work devices into these smart plugs, which many people may forget to do 
 

 Is It Possible to Track Mac Energy Consumption Using Software? 

<p>When <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/seanmclarke/">someone on the team</a> proposed using software to track energy consumption, I thought it’d be a simple task. I assumed there were various existing tools we could easily leverage to grab energy consumption data. But boy, oh boy, I was wrong!</p>

<p>As it turns out, it’s quite complicated to figure out how many watt-hours of electricity your Mac laptop is using. To the best of my knowledge, there are no off-the-shelf applications that do this.</p>

<p>Through my research, however, I stumbled across a couple potential solutions.</p>

 Using Battery Metrics to Calculate Energy Consumption 

<p>The first idea I had was to figure out the size of the laptop’s battery (in milliamp-hours (mAh)), as well as how many complete discharge cycles the battery has been through (how many times has the battery been fully charged and discharged).</p>

<p>This information would theoretically allow us to determine how much energy a Mac laptop has ever consumed by multiplying the size of the battery in mAh by the number of battery cycles. We could then simply convert the number of mAh -&gt; kWh using a simple formula.</p>

<p>After a lot of Google-fu and command-line scripting, I was able to get this information using the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/DeviceDrivers/Conceptual/IOKitFundamentals/TheRegistry/TheRegistry.html">ioreg command-line tool</a>, but in the process, I realized that there was a critical problem with this approach.</p>

<p>The problem is that while the variables I mentioned above will allow you to calculate the energy consumption of your laptop over time, when your laptop is fully charged and plugged into a wall outlet it isn’t drawing down energy from the battery – it’s using the electricity directly from your wall.</p>

<p>This means that the measuring approach above will only work if you never use your laptop while it is plugged into wall chargers – you’d essentially need to keep your laptop shut down while charging and only have it turned on while on battery power. Obviously, this is not very realistic.</p>

 Using Wall Adapter Information to Calculate Energy Consumption 

<p>After the disappointing battery research, I decided to take a different approach. What if there was a way to extract how much energy your laptop was pulling from a wall adapter?</p>

<p>If we were able to figure out how many watts of electricity, for example, your laptop was currently drawing from a wall adapter, we could track this information over time to determine the amount of watt-hours of electricity being consumed. We could then easily convert this number to kWh or any other desired measure.</p>

<p>And… After a lot of sifting through <code>ioreg</code> output and some help from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jdegges/">my little brother</a> (an engineer who helps build <a href="https://www.span.io">smart home electric panels</a>), I was able to successfully extract the amount of watts being pulled from a plugged-in wall adapter! Woo!</p>

 The Final Solution: How to Calculate the Energy Consumption of Your Mac Using Software 

<p>After many hours of research and playing around, what I ended up building was a small shell script that parses through <code>ioreg</code> command-line output and extracts the amount of watts being pulled from a plugged-in wall adapter.</p>

<p>This shell script runs on a cron job once a minute, logging energy consumption information to a file. This file can then be analyzed to compute the amount of energy consumed by a Mac device over a given time period.</p>

<p>I’ve packaged this solution up into a small GitHub project you can check out <a href="https://github.com/rdegges/energy-tracker">here</a>.</p>

<p>The command I’m using to grab the wattage information is the following:</p>

 <code>/usr/sbin/ioreg -rw0 -c AppleSmartBattery | grep BatteryData | grep -o '"AdapterPower"=[0-9]*' | cut -c 16- | xargs -I %  lldb --batch -o "print/f %" | grep -o '$0 = [0-9.]*' | cut -c 6-
</code> 

<p>Here it is broken down with a brief description of what these commands are doing:</p>

 <code>/usr/sbin/ioreg -rw0 -c AppleSmartBattery | \  # retrieve power data
  grep BatteryData | \                         # filter it down to battery stats
  grep -o '"AdapterPower"=[0-9]*' | \          # extract adapter power info
  cut -c 16- | \                               # extract power info number
  xargs -I %  lldb --batch -o "print/f %" | \  # convert power info into an IEEE 754 float
  grep -o '$0 = [0-9.]*' | \                   # extract only the numbers
  cut -c 6-                                    # remove the formatting
</code> 

<p>The output of this command is a number which is the amount of watts currently being consumed by your laptop (I verified this by confirming it with hardware energy monitors). In order to turn this value into a usable energy consumption metric, you have to sample it over time. After thinking this through, here was the logging format I came up with to make tracking energy consumption simple:</p>

 <code>timestamp=YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ wattage=&lt;num&gt; wattHours=&lt;num&gt; uuid=&lt;string&gt; 
</code> 

<p>This format allows you to see:</p>

 
 The timestamp of the log 
 The amount of watts being drawn from the wall at the time of measurement (wattage) 
 The number of watt hours consumed at the time of measurement (wattHours), assuming this measurement is taken once a minute, and 
 The unique Mac UUID for this device. This is logged to help with deduplication and other statistics in my case. 
 

<p>Here’s an example of what some real-world log entries look like:</p>

 <code>timestamp=2022-01-30T23:41:00Z wattage=8.37764739 wattHours=.13962745650000000000 uuid=EDD819A5-1409-5797-9BE4-22EAAC75D999
timestamp=2022-01-30T23:42:01Z wattage=8.7869072 wattHours=.14644845333333333333 uuid=EDD819A5-1409-5797-9BE4-22EAAC75D999
timestamp=2022-01-30T23:43:00Z wattage=9.16559505 wattHours=.15275991750000000000 uuid=EDD819A5-1409-5797-9BE4-22EAAC75D999
timestamp=2022-01-30T23:44:00Z wattage=8.49206352 wattHours=.14153439200000000000 uuid=EDD819A5-1409-5797-9BE4-22EAAC75D999
timestamp=2022-01-30T23:45:00Z wattage=7.45262718 wattHours=.12421045300000000000 uuid=EDD819A5-1409-5797-9BE4-22EAAC75D999
</code> 

<p>To sum up the amount of energy consumption over time, you can then parse this log file and sum up the <code>wattHours</code> column over a given time period. Also, please note that the script I wrote will NOT log energy consumption data to the file if there is no energy being consumed (aka, your laptop is not plugged into a wall adapter).</p>

<p>PROBLEMS: While this is the final solution we ended up going with, it still has one fatal flaw: this approach only works if the script is ran once a minute. This means that if your laptop is shut down or sleeping and this code is not running, there will be no way to log energy consumption data.</p>

 What I Learned About Tracking Energy Consumption on Macs 

<p>While building our short sustainability-focused hackathon project, I learned a lot about tracking energy consumption on Macs.</p>

 
 Your laptop doesn’t always use its battery as a power source, so tracking battery metrics is not an ideal solution 
 It’s possible to track energy consumption by measuring the draw from wall adapters, although this approach isn’t perfect as it requires your computer to be on and running code on a regular interval 
 While using hardware energy trackers isn’t convenient in our case, this is certainly the simplest (and probably the best) option for personal energy tracking 
 

<p>If you’d like to see the software-based energy tracking solution I built, please <a href="https://github.com/rdegges/energy-tracker">check it out on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>I’m currently in the process of following up with Snyk’s IT department to see if this is something we could one day roll out automatically to employee devices. I still think it would be incredibly interesting to see a central dashboard of how much energy Snyk employees are using to “power” their work, and what that amount of carbon looks like.</p>

<p>PS: The creation of this blog post took precisely <code>19.972951810666647</code> watt-hours of electricity and generated <code>.016977009039067</code> pounds of CO2.</p>

  The IETF OAuth working group has adopted the JWK Thumbprint URI specification. The abstract of the specification is: This specification registers a kind of URI that represents a JSON Web Key (JWK) Thumbprint value. JWK Thumbprints are defined in RFC 7638. This enables JWK Thumbprints to be used, for instance, as key identifiers in contexts […]

<p>The IETF <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/oauth/about/">OAuth working group</a> has adopted the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-jwk-thumbprint-uri-00.html">JWK Thumbprint URI</a> specification.  The abstract of the specification is:</p>
<blockquote><p>
This specification registers a kind of URI that represents a JSON Web Key (JWK) Thumbprint value. JWK Thumbprints are defined in RFC 7638. This enables JWK Thumbprints to be used, for instance, as key identifiers in contexts requiring URIs.</p></blockquote>
<p>The need for this arose during specification work in the <a href="https://openid.net/wg/connect/">OpenID Connect working group</a>.  In particular, JWK Thumbprint URIs are used as key identifiers that can be syntactically distinguished from other kinds of identifiers also expressed as URIs in the <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-self-issued-v2-1_0.html">Self-Issued OpenID Provider v2</a> specification.</p>
<p>Given that the specification does only one simple thing in a straightforward manner, we believe that it is ready for working group last call.</p>
<p>The specification is available at:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-jwk-thumbprint-uri-00.html">https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-jwk-thumbprint-uri-00.html</a>

<p>This post exists to collect my notes on displaying a USB webcam on the Raspberry Pi HDMI outputs. This is not the same as streaming the webcam (easy), and this is not for use with the Raspberry Pi camera module. This is specifically for USB UVC webcams.</p>
<p>Note: Do not actually do this, it's terrible.</p>
<p>Install Raspberry Pi OS Lite, you don't want the full desktop environment.</p>
<p>Once you boot the Pi, install VLC and the X windows environment:</p>
 sudo apt install vlc xinit 
<p>Configure your Pi to boot to the command line already logged in, using the tool raspi-config.</p>
<p>Create the file ~/.bash_profile with the following contents which will start X on boot:</p>
   if [ -z $DISPLAY ] &amp;&amp; [ $(tty) = /dev/tty1 ]
  <br>
  then
  <br>
  startx
  <br>
  fi
 
<p>Create the file ~/.xinitrc to launch VLC streaming the webcam when X launches:</p>
   #!/bin/bash
  <br>
  cvlc v4l2:// :v4l2-dev=/dev/video0
 
<p>Now you can reboot the Pi with a webcam plugged in and you'll get a full screen view of the camera.</p>
<p>If your webcam isn't recognized when it first boots up, you'll need to quit VLC and start it again. You can quit by pressing ctrl-Q, then type startx to restart it after you plug the camera back in. If that doesn't work, you might have to SSH in and kill the process that way.</p>
<p>There are many problems with this approach:</p>
 
   It seems VLC is not hardware accelerated so there is pretty bad tearing of the image 
   Sometimes the webcam isn't recognized when the Pi boots up and I have to unplug it and plug it back in when it boots and restart the script 
   The image tearing and stuttering is completely unusable for pretty much anything 
 
<p>Do you know of a better solution? Let me know!</p>
<p>So far I haven't found anything that actually works, and I've searched all the forums and tried all the solutions with guvcview and omxplayer with no luck so far.</p>
<p>For some other better solutions, check out my blog post and video&nbsp;<a href="https://aaronparecki.com/2022/01/11/8/convert-usb-webcam-to-hdmi">How to Convert USB Webcams to HDMI</a>.</p>

<p>Over the past years <a href="https://www.zmartzone.eu">ZmartZone</a> enabled a number of customers to migrate their Single Sign On (SSO) implementation from proprietary Oracle HTTP Server components to standards-based OpenID Connect SSO. Some observations about that:</p>



  Oracle Webgate and mod_osso are SSO plugins (aka. agents) for the Oracle HTTP Server (OHS) that implement a proprietary (Oracle) SSO/authentication protocol that provides authentication (only) against Oracle Access Manager  the said components are closed source implementations owned by Oracle  these components leverage a single domain-wide SSO cookie which has known security drawbacks, especially in todays distributed and delegated (cloud and hybrid) application landscape, see <a href="https://hanszandbelt.wordpress.com/2015/12/14/the-importance-of-audience-in-web-sso">here</a>   ZmartZone supports builds of <a href="https://github.com/zmartzone/mod_auth_openidc">mod_auth_openidc</a> that can be used as plugins in to Oracle HTTP Server (11 and 12), thus implementing standards based OpenID Connect for OHS with an open source component  those builds are a drop in replacement into OHS that can even be used to set the same headers as mod_osso/Webgate does/did  mod_auth_openidc can be used to authenticate to Oracle Access Manager but also to (both commercial and free) alternative Identity Providers such as PingFederate, Okta, Keycloak etc.  when required Oracle HTTP Server can be replaced with stock Apache HTTPd  the Oracle HTTP Server builds of mod_auth_openidc come as part of a light-weight commercial support agreement on top of the open source community support channel  



<p>In summary: modern OpenID Connect-based SSO for Oracle HTTP Server can be implemented with open source mod_auth_openidc following a fast, easy and lightweight migration plan.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry,” I said confidently, “it’ll come back to one us.”</p>
<p>Sure enough, a few days later, on a bike ride, the name popped into my head. I’m sure you’ve had the same experience. This time around it prompted me to think about how that happens.</p>
<p>To me it feels like starting up a background search process that runs for however long it takes, then notifies me when the answer is ready. I know the brain isn’t a computer, and I know this kind of model is suspect, so I wonder what’s really going on. </p>
<p>– Why was I was so sure the name would surface?</p>
<p>– Does a retrieval effort kick off neurochemical change that elaborates over time?</p>
<p>– Before computers, what model did people use to explain this phenomenon?</p>
<p>So far I’ve only got one answer. That spunky little girl was Diana.</p>

  The past is dead.&nbsp; <br>  You are here now.  <br>  The future will be administered. Data is not literature, it is structure. Data is fabric. Data is blood. Automated data will compete with humans in markets, governments, and all specialty fields of endeavor that hold promise for automated systems to function whereas.&nbsp;  <br>  Whereas human; automated human process. Automate human data extraction. Automate human data use.  <br>  I am purposefully vague -&gt; automate everything that can be automated .. this is here, now.  <br>  What is a Constitution protecting both "Human Rights" and "Civil Rights"?&nbsp;  <br>  From the view of legal precedent and human intent actualized, it is a document, a work of literary construct, and its words are utilized to determine meaning in legal concerns where the various Rights of people are concerned. Imperfect words of literature, implemented in their time and place. And of those words, a Governing system of defense for the benefit "of, by, for" the people Instituting such Governance.  <br>  This is the simple model, unique in the world, unique in history as far as is known to storytellers the world over. A literary document arriving here and now as words being introduced to their data manifestations. Data loves words. Data loves numbers. Data loves people the most. Why?  <br>  Data is "literally" defined as "data" in relation to the existence of Humanity. That which has no meaning to Humanity is not considered "data" being utilized as such. Last time I checked, Humanity did not know everything, yet. Therefore much "data" has barely been considered as existing, let alone being understood in operational conditions called "real life", or "basic existence" by people.&nbsp;  <br>  This is our administrative problem; words are not being operationalized accurately as data. The relationship between "words" and "data" as operational processes driving the relationship between "people" and "Government Administration" has not been accurately structured. In other words, words are not being interpreted as data accurately enough, if at all.  <br>  A governed system derived "of, by, for" the people creating and defending such governed process, has a basic starting point. It seems obvious, but many are eager to acquiesce to something else upon instantiation of a service relationship, when easy or convenient enough, so perhaps "obvious" is just a word. "Of, By, For" people means that "Rights" are for people, not birth certificates.&nbsp;  <br>   <a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-xucq-AxE1uQ/Ye2IUXdffMI/AAAAAAAADKE/SdbHtjqcvZ8AtqamydtM9BUhernOW4FPgCNcBGAsYHQ/image.png"></a> Consider how you administer your own life. Think back to last time you went to the DMV. Think back to last time you filed taxes and something went wrong that you needed to fix. Think back to when you registered your child for kindergarten. Think back to the last time you created an online bank account.&nbsp;  <br>  While you are considering these experiences, consider the simultaneous meaning created by the words "of, by, for" and whether any of those experiences existed outside of your Sovereign Rights as a person.  <br>  Humanity does not come into existence inside a database. The American Government does not come into authority "of, by, for" database entries.&nbsp;  <br>  Instead, people at the edges of society, in the homes of our towns derive the meaning "of, by, for" their lawful participation. Rights are for people, not birth certificates. People prove birth certificates, birth certificates do not prove people. If an administrative process follows the wrong "administrative precedent" and logic structure, then "words" cease meaning what they were intended to mean.  <br>  This words-to-data slight of hand is apparently easy to run on people. The internet, an investment itself of Government created via <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/">DARPA</a> and made public via <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/">NSF</a>, showcases daily the mis-construed meaning of "words" as "data". People are being surveilled, tracked and provisioned access to services based on having their personal "ID:DATA" leveraged. In some cases, such as the new ID.me services being used at Government databases, facial scans are being correlated to match people as "people" operating as "data".

Freedom can not exist on such an administrative plantation, whereby people are captured as data for use by 2nd and 3rd parties without any root control provided to the people giving such data existence and integrity.  <br>  People-backwards-authority will destroy this world. America can not be provisioned from a database. People possess root authority in America. America is the leader of the world, and immigrants come to America because "people possess root authority" in America. "Of, By, For" People in America, this is the greatest invention of America. Owning your own authority, owning root authority as a person expressing the Sovereign structure of your Rights as a person IS the greatest super power on planet Earth.  <br>  The American consumer marketplace is born in love with the creative spirit of Freedom. The American Dream lures people from the world over to its shores. A chance to be free, to own your own life and express your freedom in a market of ideas, where Rights are seen, protected, and leveraged for the benefit of all people. A place where work is honored, and where ladders may be climbed by personal effort and dedication in pursuit of myriad dreams.

A populace ignorant of how data would alter the meaning of words in the wrong hands was very predictable. Knowing what words as data meant in 1992 was less common.

"We" is a royal construct if used to instantiate an Institutional outcome not under the control of actual people as functioning Individuals, and instead abstracts this reality via language, form, contract or use of computer science to enable services to be rendered upon people rather than "of, by, for" people.  <br>  The backwards interpretation of words as data process is the enemy of Humanity.

<p>At the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-ed/">W3C VC-EDU Task Force</a> we’ve been planning meeting agendas and topics for 2022. We’ve been hard at work writing use cases, helping education standards organizations understand and align with VCs, and we’ve been heading towards a model recommendation doc for the community. In 2022 we plan on building upon this and are ramping up for an exciting year of&nbsp;pilots.</p><p>To get things in order, we compiled a list of topics and descriptions in this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NlO4mKV31NWE4RKQ3R_8kVv0AEaz4VkWSW0uLJmPLmI/edit#gid=0">sheet</a> and have set up a <a href="https://bit.ly/W3C_VC_EDU_priorities2022">ranking system</a>. This ranking system is open until January 19 at 11:59pm ET and anyone is invited to weigh in. The co-chairs will evaluate the results and we’ll discuss them at the January 24th VC-EDU Call (<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-ed/">call connection info</a>).</p><p>It’s a lengthy and thought-provoking list and I hope we have the opportunity to dig deep into each of these topics and maybe more. I reconsidered my choices quite a few times before I landed on these top&nbsp;5:</p>  Verifiable Presentations (VPs) vs (nested) Verifiable Credentials (VCs) in the education context — How to express complex nested credentials (think full transcript). The description references full transcript but this topic is also related to presentation of multiple single achievements by the learner. I ranked this first because presentations are a core concept of VCs and very different from how the education ecosystem is accustomed to sharing their credentials. VPs introduce an exchange of credentials in response to a verifiable request versus sharing a badge online or emailing a PDF. Also, there’s been quite a bit of discussion surrounding more complex credentials such as published transcripts that we can get into&nbsp;here.  Integration with Existing Systems — Digitizing existing systems, vs creating; existing LMSes; bridging; regulatory requirements — ex: licensing, PDFs needing to be visually inspected. To gain some traction with VCs, we need to understand how systems work now and what can be improved upon using VCs but also, how do we make VCs work with what is needed&nbsp;now?  Bridging Tech. This ties into integrating with existing systems above. We are accustomed to the tech we have now and it will be with us for some time. For instance, email will still be used for usernames and identity references even when Decentralized Identifiers start gaining traction. They will coexist and it can be argued that compromises will need to be made (some will argue against&nbsp;this).  Protocols — Much of the work in VC-EDU so far has been about the data model. But what about the protocols — what do we /do/ with the VCs once we settle on the format? (How to issue, verify, exchange, etc). This made my top five because as the description notes, we’re pretty close to a data model but we need to understand more about the protocols that deliver, receive, and negotiate credential exchanges. Part of what we do in VC-EDU is learn more about what is being discussed and developed in the broader ecosystem and understanding protocols will help the community with implementation.  Context file for VC-EDU — Create a simple context file to describe an achievement claim. There are education standards organizations like IMS Global (Open Badges &amp; CLR) that are working towards aligning with VC-EDU but having an open, community-created description of an achievement claim, even if it reuses elements from other vocabularies, will provide a simple and persistent reference. A context file in VC-EDU could also provide terms for uses in VCs that haven’t yet been explored in education standards organizations and could be models for future functionality considerations.

<p>Today, there are more and more initiatives working on decentralized identity infrastructures, or Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI). However, there is a big paradox underlying all those initiatives: Even though they often use the same technical specifications&nbsp;, e.g. W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs), they are in practice usually not compatible. There are just too many details where technological choices can diverge. Yes we all use DIDs and VCs. But do we use Data Integrity Proofs (formerly called Linked Data Proofs) or JWT Proofs? JSON-LD contexts or JSON schemas, or both? Do we use DIDComm (which version?), or CHAPI, or one of the emerging new variants of OpenID Connect? Which one of the many revocation mechanisms? Which DID methods? How do we format our deep links and encode our QR&nbsp;codes?</p><p>We all want to build the missing identity layer for the Internet, where everything is interoperable just like on the web. But we all do it in slightly different ways. So how can we solve this paradox? Do we create yet another interoperability working&nbsp;group?</p><p>No! We try out simple steps and make them work. We conduct concrete experiments that bridge gaps and cross borders. In this case, we planned and executed an experiment that demonstrates interoperability between prominent decentralized identity initiatives in the EU and the US, funded by the <a href="https://ngiatlantic.eu/">NGIatlantic.eu</a> program. Two companies collaborated on this project: <a href="https://danubetech.com/">Danube Tech (EU)</a> and <a href="https://digitalbazaar.com/">Digital Bazaar&nbsp;(US)</a>.</p>EU-US collaboration on decentralized identity<p>In the EU, the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/EBSI">European Blockchain Service Infrastructure (EBSI)</a> is building an ambitious network that could become the basis for a digital wallet for all EU citizens. In the US, the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/blockchain-portfolio">Department of Homeland Security‘s Silicon Valley Innovation Program (SVIP)</a> is working with companies around the world on personal digital credentials as well as trade use cases. Both projects have developed easy-to-understand narratives (student “Eva” in EBSI, immigrant “Louis” in SVIP). Both narratives are described further in the W3C’s DID Use Cases document (<a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-use-cases/#digitalPRC">here</a> and <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-use-cases/#publicAuthorityCredentials">here</a>). So we thought, let’s conduct an experiment that combines narratives and technological elements from both the EU and US&nbsp;sides!</p>SVIP (left side) and EBSI (right&nbsp;side)<p>We built and demonstrated two combined&nbsp;stories:</p>  Eva studied in the EU and would then like to apply for a US visa. In this story, there is an EU-based Issuer of a VC, and a US-based Verifier.  Louis is an immigrant in the US and would like to apply for PhD studies at an EU university. In this story, there is a US-based Issuer of a VC, and an EU-based Verifier.  <p>For a walkthrough video, see: <a href="https://youtu.be/1t9m-U-3lMk">https://youtu.be/1t9m-U-3lMk</a></p><p>For a more detailed report, see: <a href="https://github.com/danubetech/transatlantic-ssi-interop/">https://github.com/danubetech/transatlantic-ssi-interop/</a></p><p>In the broader decentralized identity community, both the EU- and US-based initiatives currently have strong influence. EBSI’s main strength is its ability to bring together dozens of universities and other organizations to build a vibrant community of VC Issuer and Verifiers. SVIP’s great value has been its continuous work on concrete test suites and interoperability events (“plugfests”) that involve multiple heterogeneous vendor solutions.</p><p>In this project, we used <a href="https://gitlab.grnet.gr/essif-lab/infrastructure_2/danubetech/SSI_Java_Libraries_project_summary">open-source libraries</a> supported by ESSIF-Lab, as well as the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver">Universal Resolver</a> project from the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF). We also used various components supplied by Digital Bazaar, such as the Veres&nbsp;Wallet.</p><p>We hope that our “Transatlantic SSI Interop” experiment can serve as an inspiration and blueprint for further work on interoperability not only between different DID methods and VC types, but also between different vendors, ecosystems, and even continents.</p>Wallet containing an EU Diploma and US Permanent Resident&nbsp;Card

<div class='wrap'>

<p>This step-by-step guide will show you how to use the chroma key feature on the YoloBox Pro to green screen yourself onto picture backgrounds and videos, or even add external graphics from a computer.</p>



<p>There are a few different ways to use the green screening feature in the YoloBox. 
You can use it to add a flat virtual background to your video, or you could use it to put yourself over a moving background or other video sources like an overhead or document camera. You could even key yourself over your computer screen showing your slides from a presentation.</p>

 
  
  
 

 
  
  
 

<p>You can also switch things around and instead of removing the background from your main camera, instead you can generate graphics on a computer screen with a green background and add those on top of your video.</p>

 Setting up your green screen 

<p>Before jumping in to the YoloBox, you'll want to make sure your green screen is set up properly. A quick summary of what you'll need to do is:</p>

 
 Light your green screen evenly 
 Light your subject 
 Don't wear anything green 
 

<p>Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH8TWTt51W8">Kevin The Basic Filmmaker's excellent green screen tutorial</a> for a complete guide to these steps!</p>

 Green screening on top of an image 

<p>We'll first look at how to green screen a camera on top of a static image. You can load images in to the YoloBox by putting them on the SD card. I recommend creating your background image at exactly the right size first, 1920x1080.</p>

<p>On the YoloBox, click the little person icon in the top right corner of the camera that you want to remove the green background from.</p>

<p></p>

<p>That will open up the Chroma Key Settings interface.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Turn on the "Keying Switch", and you should see a pretty good key if your green screen is lit well. If you have a blue screen instead of green, you can change that setting here. The "Similarity" and "Smoothness" sliders will affect how the YoloBox does the key. Adjust them until things look right and you don't have too much of your background showing and it isn't eating into your main subject.</p>

<p>Tap on the "Background Image" to choose which image from your SD card to use as the background. Only still graphics are supported.</p>

<p>Click "Done" and this will save your settings into that camera's source.</p>

<p>Now when you tap on that camera on the YoloBox, it will always include the background image in place of the green screen.</p>

<p></p>

 Green screening on top of other video sources 

<p>Green screening yourself on top of other video sources is similar but a slightly different process.</p>

<p>First, set up your HDMI source as described above, but instead of choosing a background image, leave it transparent.</p>

<p>Then click the "Add Video Source" button to create a new picture-in-picture layout.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Choose "PiP Video" from the options that appear. For the "Main Screen", choose the video angle that you want to use as the full screen background that you'll key yourself on top of. This could be a top down camera or could be your computer screen with alides for a presentation. It will then ask you to choose a "Sub Screen", and that is where you'll choose your camera angle that you've already set up for chroma keying.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This is where you can choose how big you want your picture to be, and you can drag it around with your finger to change the position.</p>

<p>Once you save this, your new PiP layout will appear as another camera angle you can switch to.</p>

 Cropping the green screened video 

<p>You may notice that if your green background doesn't cover the entire frame, you'll have black borders on the sides of your chroma keyed image. The YoloBox doesn't exactly have a cropping feature to fix this, but you can use the "Aspect Ratio" setting to crop the background.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You can edit your PiP video settings and choose "1:1" in the Aspect Ratio option to crop your video to a square, removing the black borders from the edges.</p>

<p></p>

 Adding computer graphics using the chroma key 

<p>Lastly, let's look at how to bring in graphics from an external computer source and key them out on the YoloBox.</p>

<p>When you plug in your computer's HDMI to the YoloBox, your computer will see it as an external monitor. Make sure your computer screen isn't mirrored so you can still use your main computer screen separately.</p>

<p>You can generate graphics in any program as long as you can have it use a green background. You can create animated graphics in Keynote for example, but for this tutorial we'll use the app <a href="https://h2r.graphics">H2R Graphics</a>.</p>

<p>In H2R Graphics, you'll first want to make sure you set the background color to a bright green like #00FF00. Then you can open up the main output window and drag it over to your second screen (the YoloBox).</p>

<p></p>

<p>Choose the little person icon in the top right corner of the HDMI input of your computer screen to bring up the keying settings for it.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The defaults should look fine, but you can also make any adjustments here if you need. Click "Done" to save the settings.</p>

<p>Now you can create a new PiP layout with your main video as the background and your computer screen keyed out as the foreground or "Sub Screen".</p>

<p>For the Main Screen, choose the video angle you want to use as the background.</p>

<p></p>

<p>For the Sub Screen, choose your computer screen which should now have a transparent background.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now the layout with your H2R Graphics output window is created as the PiP angle you can choose.</p>

<p></p>

 My YoloBox stand 

<p>If you haven't already seen it, be sure to check out my <a href="https://pk1.tv/pk1-yolobox-stand/">YoloBox stand</a> I created! It tilts the YoloBox forward so it's easier to use on a desk, and you can also attach things to the cold shoe mounts on the back.</p>

<p><a href="https://pk1.tv/pk1-yolobox-stand/"></a></p>

<p>We have a version for both the YoloBox Pro and the original YoloBox, and it comes in red and black!</p>

In particular, it now describes using JWK Thumbprint URIs as key identifiers that can be syntactically distinguished from other kinds of identifiers also expressed as URIs.  It is used this way in the <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-self-issued-v2-1_0.html">Self-Issued OpenID Provider v2</a> specification, for instance.  No normative changes were made.</p>
<p>As discussed on the call, we are requesting that that the chairs use this new draft as the basis for a call for working group adoption.</p>
<p>The specification is available at:</p>

<p>Reification. I learned that word from Kim. In the immediate next breath he said from the stage that he was told not everyone knew what reify meant and that he would use a more approachable word: “thingify.” And therein I learned another lesson from Kim about how to present to an audience.</p>



<p>My memories of Kim come in three phases: Kim as Legend, Kim as Colleague, and Kim as Human, and with each phase came new things to learn.</p>



<p>My first memories of Kim were of Kim as Legend. I think the very first was from IIW 1 (or maybe 2 – the one in Berkeley) at which he presented InfoCard. He owned the stage; he owned the subject matter. He continued to own the stage and the subject matter for years…sometimes the subject matter was more concrete, like InfoCard, and sometimes it was more abstract, like the metaverse. But regardless, it was enthralling.</p>



<p>At some point something changed… Kim was no longer an unapproachable Legend. He was someone with whom I could talk, disagree, and more directly question. In this phase of Kim as Colleague, I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to ask him private follow-up questions to his presentation. Leaving aside my “OMG he’s talking to me” feelings, I was blown away by his willingness to go into depth of his thought process with someone who didn’t work with him. He was more than willing to be challenged and to discuss the thorny problems in our world.</p>



<p>Somewhere in the midst of the Kim as Colleague phase something changed yet again and it is in this third phase, Kim as Human, where I have my most precious memories of him. Through meeting some of his family, being welcomed into his home, and sharing meals, I got to know Kim as the warm, curious, eager-to-laugh person that he was. There was seemingly always a glint in his eye indicating his willingness to cause a little trouble.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The last in-person memory I have of him was just before the pandemic lockdowns in 2020. I happened to be lucky enough to be invited to an OpenID Foundation event at which Kim was speaking.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DExNTY3QAk&amp;list=PL_SpvfiaWukuRrraW1ysHzlf4ehCCCK9l&amp;index=11">He talked about his vision for the future and identity’s role therein</a>. At the end of his presentation, I and others helped him down the steep stairs off of the stage. I held onto one of his hands as we helped him down. His hand was warm.</p>

<p>Kim might no longer update his blog, nudge identity products toward his vision or give inspiring, generous talks to audiences large and small, but his influence looms large in the identity industry – an industry Kim changed forever. A lot has been written about Kim’s legacy to the industry already, by people who write far better than yours truly, hence I won’t attempt that here.</p>



<p>I owe a huge debt of gratitude to Kim: I don’t know where I’d be or what I’d be doing if it wouldn’t have been for his ideas and direct sponsorship. That’s something I have firsthand experience on, so I can honor his memory by writing about that.</p>



<p>Back in 2005, still in Italy, I was one of the few Microsoft employees with hands-on, customer deployment experience in WS-STAR, the suite of protocols behind the SOA revolution. That earned me a job offer in Redmond, to evangelize the .NET stack (WCF, workflow, CardSpace) to Fortune 500 companies. That CardSpace thing was puzzling. There was nothing like it, it was ultra hard to develop for, and few people appeared to understand what it was for. One day I had face time with Kim. He introduced me to his <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/stories/2005/05/13/TheLawsOfIdentity.pdf">Laws of Identity</a>, and that changed everything. Suddenly the technology I was working on had a higher purpose, something directly connected to the rights and wellbeing of everyone- and a mission, making user centric identity viable and adopted. I gave myself to the mission with abandon, and Kim helped in every step of the way:</p>



  He invested time in developing me professionally, sharing his master negotiator and genuinely compassionate view of people to counter my abrasive personality back then  He looped me in important conversations, inside and outside the company- conversations way above my pay grade or actual experience at that point. He introduced me to all sorts of key people, and helped me understand what was going on. Perhaps the most salient example is the initiative he led to bring together the different identity products Microsoft had in the late 2000s (and culminating in <a href="https://www.cloudidentity.com/blog/2008/10/28/identity-pdc08-roadmap-session-with-kim-cameron-himself-yours-truly/">a joint presentation we delivered at PDC2008</a>). The company back then was a very different place, and his steely determination coupled with incredible consensus building skills forever changed my perception of what’s possible and how to influence complex, sometimes adversarial organizations.&nbsp;  He really taught me to believe in myself and in a mission. That’s thanks to his encouragement that I approached Joan Murray (then acquisition editor at Addison Wesley) on the expo floor of some event, pitching to her a book that the world absolutely needs about cardspace and user centric identity, and once accepted finding the energy to learn everything (putting together a ToC, recruiting coauthors, writing in English…) as an evenings and weekends project. Kim generously wrote the foreword for us, and <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/?p=927">relentlessly promoted the book</a>.<br>His sponsorship continued even after the CardSpace project, promoting <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/?p=1160">my other books</a> and activities (like those <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/?p=1095">U-prove videos now lost in time</a>).&nbsp;  



<p>Those are just the ones top of mind. I am sure that if”d dig in his or my blog, I’d find countless more. It’s been a huge privilege to work so closely with Kim, and especially to benefit from his mentorship and friendship. I never, ever took that privilege for granted. Although Kim always seemed to operate under the assumption that everyone had something of value to contribute, and talking with him made you feel heard, he wasn’t shy in calling out trolls or people who in his view would <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/?p=853">stifle community efforts</a>.</p>



<p>When the user centric identity effort substantially failed to gain traction in actual products, with the identity industry incorporating some important innovations (hello, claims) but generally rejecting many of the key tenets I held so dear, something broke inside me. I became disillusioned with pure principled views, and moved toward a stricter Job to be done, user cases driven stance.</p>



<p>That, <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/?p=1190">Kim’s temporary retirement from Microsoft</a> and eventually my move to Auth0 made my interactions with Kim less frequent. It was always nice to run into him at conferences; we kept backchanneling whenever industry news called for coordinated responses; and he reached out to me once to discuss SSI, but we never had a chance to do so. As cliche’ as it might be, I now deeply regret not having reached out more myself.<br>Last time I heard from him, it was during a <a href="https://twitter.com/vibronet/status/1452848874339454979?s=20">reunion of the CardSpace team</a>. It was a joyous occasion, seeing so many people that for a time all worked to realize his vision, and touched in various degrees by his influence. His health didn’t allow him to attend in person, but he called in – we passed the phone around, exchanging pleasantries without knowing we were saying our goodbyes. I remember his “hello Vittorio” as I picked up the phone from Mike- his cordial, even sweet tone as he put his usual care in pronouncing my name just right- right there to show the kindness this giant used with us all.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are a handful of interesting USB webcams out there, which naturally work great with a computer. But what if you want to combine video from a USB webcam with your HDMI cameras in a video switcher like the ATEM Mini?</p>
<p>Most video switchers don't have a way to plug in USB webcams. That's because webcams are expected to plug in to a computer, and most video switchers aren't really computers. Thankfully over the past few years, UVC has become a standard for webcams, so there is no more worry about installing manufacturer-specific drivers for webcams anymore. For the most part, you can take any USB webcam and plug it into a computer and it will Just Work™.</p>
<p>I'm going to show you three different ways you can convert a USB UVC webcam to HDMI so you can use them with hardware video switchers like the ATEM Mini.</p>
<p>You can see a video version of this blog post on my YouTube channel!</p>



 Method 1: QuickTime Player 
<p>The simplest option is to use QuickTime on a Mac computer. For this, you'll need a Mac of course, as well as an HDMI output from the computer.</p>
<p>First, plug in the HDMI from your computer into your video switcher. Your computer will see it as a second monitor. In your display settings, make sure your computer is not mirroring the display. You want the computer to see the ATEM Mini or other video switcher as a secondary external display.</p>
<p>If you're doing this with the ATEM Mini, it's helpful to have a monitor plugged in to the ATEM Mini's HDMI output port, and then you can show your computer screen full screen on the ATEM's output by selecting that input's button in the "output" selector on the right side of the controls. This is important since you'll want to be able to navigate around the second screen a bit in the next steps.</p>
<p>Next, open QuickTime Player. Plug in your USB webcam into your computer. In the QuickTime "File" menu, choose "New Movie Recording". A window should appear with your default webcam. Click the little arrow next to the record button and you should see all your connected cameras as an option. Choose the USB camera you want to use and you should see it in the main video window.</p>

  

<p>Now drag that QuickTime window onto your second monitor that is actually the ATEM Mini. Click the green button in the top left corner to make the window full screen. Now what you see on the ATEM Mini should be just the full screen video. Make sure you move your cursor back to your main monitor so that it doesn't show up on the screen.</p>
<p>You're all set! You can switch the ATEM back to the multiview and you should see your webcam feed as one of the video inputs you can switch to.</p>
 Method 2: OBS 
<p>OBS is a powerful tool for doing all sorts of interesting things with video on your computer. You can use it to run a livestream, switching between multiple cameras and adding graphics on top. What we're going to use it for now is a simple way to get your USB cameras to show up on a second monitor attached to your computer.</p>
<p>Another benefit of OBS is that it is cross platform, so this method will work on Mac, Windows or Linux!</p>
<p>The basic idea is to create a scene in OBS that is just a full screen video of the webcam you want to use. Then you'll tell OBS to output that video on your second monitor, but the second monitor will actually be your computer's HDMI output plugged in to the ATEM Mini.</p>
<p>First, create a new scene, call it whatever you want, I'll call mine "Webcam". Inside that scene, add a new source of type "Video Capture Device". I'll call mine "Webcam Source".</p>

  

<p>When you create the source, it will ask you which video capture device you want to use, so choose your desired webcam at this step.</p>
<p>At this point you should see the webcam feed in the OBS main window. If it's not full screen, that's probably because the webcam is not full 1920x1080 resolution. You can drag the handles on the video to resize the picture to take up the full 1920x1080 screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, right click anywhere in the main video window and choose "Fullscreen Projector (Preview)". Or if you use OBS in "Studio Mode", right click on the right pane and choose "Fullscreen Projector (Program)". Choose your secondary monitor that's plugged in to the ATEM, and OBS should take over that monitor and show just the video feed.</p>
 Method 3: Hardware Encoder 
<p>If you don't want to tie up a computer with this task, or don't have the space for a computer, another option is to use a dedicated hardware encoder to convert the USB webcam to HDMI.</p>
<p>There aren't a lot of options on the market for this right now, likely because it's not a super common thing to need to do. Currently, any device that can convert a UVC webcam to HDMI is basically a tiny computer. One example is the YoloBox which can accept some USB webcams as a video source alongside HDMI cameras. You could use the YoloBox to convert the USB camera to HDMI using the HDMI output of the YoloBox.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another option is this <a href="https://geni.us/Z9hTXE">TBS2603au encoder/decoder</a>.&nbsp;</p>

  

<p>I originally was sent this device by TBS because I was interested in using it as an RTMP server. I wasn't able to figure that out, and have since switched to using the <a href="https://aaronpk.tv/timestamps/#magewell">Magewell Pro Convert</a> as an RTMP server which has been working great. But as I was poking around in the menus I realized that the TBS2603au has a USB port which can accept webcams!</p>
<p>So here are the step by step instructions for setting up the TBS2603au to output a USB webcam over its HDMI port.</p>
<p>The TBS2603au is controlled from its web interface. I'm going to assume you already know how to connect this to your network and configure the IP address and get to the device's web page. The default username and password are "admin" and "admin". Once you log in, you'll see a dashboard like this.</p>

<p></p>

<p>First, click on the "Encode" icon in the top bar. At the bottom, turn off the HDMI toggle and turn on the one next to USB.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next click on the "Extend" tab in the top menu and choose "Video Mix".</p>

<p></p>

<p>Scroll down to the "Output Config" section and change "Mix Enable" to "Off", and choose "USBCam" from the "Video Source" option.</p>

<p></p>

<p>At this point you should see your webcam's picture out the device's HDMI port!&nbsp;And if that's plugged in to the ATEM Mini, your webcam will appear in your multiview!</p>
<p></p>

<p>I've tried this with a few different webcams and they all work great!&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://geni.us/uHHcs0A">OBSBot Tiny</a> is an auto-tracking PTZ camera that follows your face. The nice thing is that the camera itself is doing the face tracking, so no drivers are required!</p>
<p>The <a href="https://geni.us/Ds8ko3">Elgato FaceCam</a> is a high quality webcam for your PC, and it also works with this device. Although at that point you should probably just get a DSLR/mirrorless camera to use with the ATEM Mini.</p>
<p>This even works with the <a href="https://geni.us/MAcd">Insta360 One X2</a> in webcam mode. You won't get a full 360 picture, since in webcam mode the Insta360 One X2 uses only one of its two cameras. It does do some auto-tracking though.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://geni.us/mevo-3-pack">Mevo Start</a> cameras are another interesting option, since you can crop in to specific parts of the video using a phone as a remote control.</p>
<p>There are a couple of problems with this method to be aware of. I wasn't able to find a way to output audio from the USB webcam, which means you will need to get your audio into the ATEM from another camera or external microphone. Another problem was with certain cameras (mainly the OBSBot Tiny), I left the device running overnight and in the morning it had crashed. I suspect it's because the OBSBot requires more power than other cameras due to its PTZ motor.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://geni.us/Z9hTXE">TBS encoder</a> isn't cheap, so it's not something you'd buy to use a generic webcam with your ATEM. But for use with specialized USB webcams like document cameras or PTZ cameras it could be a good option to use those cameras with streaming encoders like the ATEM Mini!</p>
<p>Let me know what USB webcams you'd like to use with your ATEM Mini or other hardware streaming encoder!</p>

 Identity management is an iterative process with three core elements – initial identification, authentication (re-identifying the individual) and verification (ensuring the individual is who they claim to be) 
 Enterprises employ a vast array of technologies to execute these processes which are growing in scope and complexity 
 Understanding why identity management is necessary to enterprises and how this creates opportunities for vendors

<p>The New York Times Editorial Board in an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/01/opinion/january-6-attack-committee.html" title="Every Day Is Jan. 6 Now">unusually direct piece</a> last week:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is regular citizens [who threaten election officials] and <a href="https://www.vox.com/22774745/death-threats-election-workers-public-health-school">other public
servants</a>, who ask, <a href="https://twitter.com/BillKristol/status/1458768784836149250">“When can we use the guns?”</a> and who <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/01/peter-meijer-freshman-republican-impeach/620844/">vow to murder</a>
politicians who dare to vote their conscience. It is Republican lawmakers
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/04/us/politics/gop-voting-rights-democrats.html">scrambling to make it harder</a> for people to vote and easier to subvert their
will if they do. It is Donald Trump who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/17/us/politics/trump-voter-fraud-republicans.html">continues to stoke the flames</a> of
conflict with his rampant lies and limitless resentments and whose twisted
version of reality still dominates one of the nation’s two major political
parties.</p>
<p>In short, the Republic faces an existential threat from a movement that is
openly contemptuous of democracy and has shown that it is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/12/us/politics/republican-violent-rhetoric.html">willing to use
violence</a> to achieve its ends. No self-governing society can survive such a
threat by denying that it exists. Rather, survival depends on looking back and
forward at the same time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See also <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/22814025/democracy-trump-january-6-capitol-riot-election-violence" title="How does this end?">this Vox piece</a>. Great to see these outlets sound the alarm about
the dangers to American democracy. The threats are very real, and clear-eyed
discussions should ver much be dominating the public sphere.</p>
<p>More of this, please.</p>

<p>A year after we moved to northern California I acquired a pair of shiny new titanium hip joints. There would be <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2015/04/12/my-last-run/">no more running</a> for me. But I’m a lucky guy who gets to to bike and hike more than ever amidst spectacular scenery that no-one could fully explore in a lifetime.</p>
<p>Although the osteoarthritis was more advanced on the right side, we opted for bilateral replacement because the left side wasn’t far behind. Things hadn’t felt symmetrical in the years leading up to the surgery, and that didn’t change. There’s always a sense that something’s different about the right side. </p>
<p>We’re pretty sure it’s not the hardware. X-rays show that the implants remain firmly seated, and there’s no measurable asymmetry. Something about the software has changed, but there’s been no way to pin down what’s different about the muscles, tendons, and ligaments on that side, whether there’s a correction to be made, and if so, how.</p>
<p>Last month, poking around on my iPhone, I noticed that I’d never opened the Health app. That’s beause I’ve always been ambivalent about the quantified self movement. In college, when I left competive gymnastics and took up running, I avoided tracking time and distance. Even then, before the advent of fancy tech, I knew I was capable of obsessive data-gathering and analysis, and didn’t want to go there. It was enough to just run, enjoy the scenery, and feel the afterglow.</p>
<p>When I launched the Health app, I was surprised to see that it had been counting my steps since I became an iPhone user 18 months ago. Really? I don’t recall opting into that feature. </p>
<p>Still, it was (of course!) fascinating to see the data and trends. And one metric in particular grabbed my attention: Walking Asymmetry. </p>
<blockquote><p>
Walking asymmetry is the percent of time that your steps with one foot are faster or slower than the other foot.<br>
…<br>
An even or symmetrical walk is often an important physical therapy goal when recovering from injury.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Here’s my chart for the past year.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I first saw this in mid-December when the trend was at its peak. What caused it? Well, it’s been rainy here (thankfully!), so I’ve been riding less, maybe that was a factor? </p>
<p>Since then I haven’t biked more, though, and I’ve walked the usual mile or two most days, with longer hikes on weekends. Yet the data suggest that I’ve reversed the trend.</p>
<p>What’s going on here?</p>
<p>Maybe this form of biofeedback worked. Once aware of the asymmetry I subconsciously corrected it. But that doesn’t explain the November/December trend.</p>
<p>Maybe the metric is bogus. A phone in your pocket doesn’t seem like a great way to measure walking asymmetry. I’ve also noticed that my step count and distances vary, on days when I’m riding, in ways that are hard to explain.</p>
<p>I’d like to try some real gait analysis using wearable tech. I suspect that data recorded from a couple of bike rides, mountain hikes, and neighborhood walks could help me understand the forces at play, and that realtime feedback could help me balance those forces. </p>
<p>I wouldn’t want to wear it all the time, though. It’d be a diagnostic and therapeutic tool, not a lifestyle. </p>

<p>In September 1982, artificial intelligence professor Scott Fahlman made a post on the Carnegie Mellon Computer Science Department “general” bboard inventing the original smiley :-).  I remember thinking at the time when I read it “what a good idea!”.  But in 2002 when I told friends about it, I couldn’t find Scott’s post online anywhere.</p>
<p>So in 2002, I led a computing archaeology expedition to restore his post.  As described in <a href="https://self-issued.info/Smiley/Smiley.html">my original post describing this accomplishment</a>, after a significant effort to locate it, on September 10, 2002 the original post made by Scott Fahlman on CMU CS general bboard was retrieved by Jeff Baird from an October 1982 backup tape of the spice vax (cmu-750x).  Here is Scott’s original post:</p>
<blockquote>
 19-Sep-82 11:44    Scott E  Fahlman             :-)
From: Scott E  Fahlman &lt;Fahlman at Cmu-20c&gt;

I propose that the following character sequence for joke markers:

:-)

Read it sideways.  Actually, it is probably more economical to mark
things that are NOT jokes, given current trends.  For this, use

</blockquote>
<p>I’m reposting this here now both to recommemorate the accomplishment nearly twenty years later, and because my page at Microsoft Research where it was originally posted is no longer available.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/books/project-hail-mary/9780593135204" title="“Project Hail Mary” on Bookshop.org">Project Hail Mary</a> follows the success of Andy Weir’s first novel, <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/the-martian/9780553418026" title="“The Martian” on Bookshop.org">The
Martian</a>, and delivers the same kind of enjoyment. If a harrowing story of a
solitary man in extreme environments using science and his wits to overcome one
obstacle after another then this is the book for you. No super powers, no
villains, no other people, really — just the a competent scientist overcoming
the odds through experimentation, constant iteration, and sheer creativity.
Personally I can’t get enough of it. Shoot it right into my veins.</p>
<p>Andy Weir seems to know his strengths and weaknesses, given these two books. If
you want read stories of a diverse array of people interacting and growing
through compelling character arcs, well, look elsewhere. <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/project-hail-mary/9780593135204" title="“Project Hail Mary” on Bookshop.org">Project Hail Mary</a>
doesn’t feature characters, really, but archetypes. No one really grows in this
story: Ryland Grace, our protagonist and narrator, displays a consistent
personality from start to finish. The book attempts to show him overcoming a
character flaw, but it comes so late and at such variance to how he behaves and
speaks to us that it frankly makes no sense.</p>
<p>But never mind, I can read other books for character growth and interaction. I’m
here for the compelling plot, super interesting ideas and challenges (a whole
new species that lives on the sun and migrates to Venus to breed? Lay it on
me). It tickles my engineering and scientist inclinations, and we could use
more of that sort of plotting in media.</p>
<p>So hoover it up. <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/project-hail-mary/9780593135204" title="“Project Hail Mary” on Bookshop.org">Project Hail Mary</a> is a super fun adventure with compelling
ideas, creative, competent people overcoming extreme circumstances without magic
or hand-waving, and an unexpected friendship between two like-minded nerds in
space.</p>
<p>I bet it’ll make a <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12042730/" title="IMDB: “Project Hail Mary”">good movie</a>, too.</p>

  Is it possible to fix the tragedy of the commons problem with a DAO Governance Token?

<p>One of the biggest problems in open source software development today is that it’s that the majority of open source software is written by developers as side projects on their nights and weekends. Out of the mix of developers who do produce software in their nights and weekends only a small sliver of them receive any funding for their work. Of the small portion of developers who do get sponsored, an even smaller percentage are actually able to make enough money to fully cover their expenses in life. So clearly we haven’t developed a sustainable solution to finance open source software development. So what are the main ways that open source software development gets funded? The two primary methods that I see open source software being developed with is via organizational sponsors or altruistic funding. Let’s break these down a bit more to gain a better understanding of them.</p>

<p>The most common and well understood method today that open source projects are funded is via for-profit corporations sponsoring development of projects by way of allowing their full time staff to work on these large projects. Some great examples of this are projects like Kubernetes, Linux kernel, React Framework, Hashicorp Vault, and Rust programming language. In all of these examples, these projects are either directly managed via a team of developers at large organizations (think React Framework being maintained by Facebook), managed by a startup who opensources their core product with additional sticky features (think Hashicorp Vault), managed by a foundation with a combination of many different developers from many different organizations (think Kubernetes and the Linux kernel these days and now Rust Lang), and finally there’s hybrid projects which have transitioned from one category to another over time (Think Rust language being started at Mozilla and then transferred to a foundation). With all of these models one thing is clear. Developers have a day job that pays them and they’re essentially employed to produce open source software. The reasons why many companys are funding developers to produce open source development is so scattered that I’m sure I couldn’t name them all. However, one thing in my experience is clear and that is that most companies have some form of strategic decision at play that leads them down the path of making their source code open. Whether that strategy be as simple as they want to allow others to solve a problem they’ve had to solve, they want to leverage open source as a sales channel, or they’re simply looking for free software developement contributions from developers who like the project. Whatever, the reason the company has to justify it’s contributions it’s pretty clear that this is a major avenue for contribution to the OSS community.</p>

<p>The second most common method of development which has been around for awhile, but has only recently become a more legitimate model of funding has been through altruistic funding. What I mean by this method is that people, organizations, or other such entities will “sponsor” a developer who’s released an open source project that they believe should continue to be worked on. This most commonly was done via Paypal or Buy me a coffee in the past with Patreon and Github Sponsors getting involved more recently as well. This model of funding is becoming more common of a way to fund a small project which is used substantially by much larger projects or companies who want some certainty that the project will continue to be maintained in the future. It’s shown some promise for becoming a sustainable source of funding for developers who are looking for a way to monetize their projects without a massive overhead that comes with starting a company. However, while this method does leave the original maintainer in control of their project to continue to bring their vision to reality, it often times does not provide a sustainable and large enough income for most maintainers to leverage this avenue full time.</p>

<p>So what’s up with this DAO governance token idea then?</p>

<p>To put it simply the concept of leveraging a DAO token to manage an open source project is still just that - an idea. So why do I considered it worth exploring? Today, in the Defi space we see many different projects that are being built completely open source and doing so with often times very complex tokenomics schemes just to sustainably fund the development of the protocol. With each new project the developers need to find a new way to integrate a token into the system in order to fund their time and effort that they’d like to put into growing the project. However, what if we could re-shape the purpose of tokens to make it actually what the tokens are about which is funding the development of the project rather than trying to create a new gift card scheme for each new project?</p>

<p>The way I imagine this would work is via a DAO goverance token which effectively represents a share of the project. Each token that’s already been minted would allow for voting on proposals for to accept or reject new changes to the project in the same way that DAOs allow for decentralized goverance of treasuries today. However these proposals all come in the form of a pull request to modify the code allowing for developers to directly receive value for the proposed changes their making. Where things get interesting is that along with the new pull request comes a proposal set forth by the contributor who would assign a value they believe it’s worth represented in the value of new tokens which would be approved if the pull request is approved. This effectively would be diluting the value of the current tokens in exchange for work they’ve done to improve the project leading to an interesting trade in value. Current majority stake holders give up a small portion of their funds in exchange for receiving new contributions if and only if they believe the dilution is acceptable.</p>

<p>So how does this make developers money?</p>

<p>As a project grows and is utilized by more and more developers it will create an economic incentive for people and companies who wish to steer a project to buy up the currently available tokens or contribute to the project in order to collect these tokens. This value would be tradeable in terms of real world value either for money to buy food or for additional utility in upstream or downstream projects. The value of the tokens is only as valuable as the number of people who are utilizing the project and believe they need the ability to affect the direction of the project or make sure it remains maintained. Meaning for projects like Kubernetes where there’s numerous companies who’s core infrastructure built on top of this project they want to make sure they’re features are getting added and supported. Just like they do today in the Cloud Native Computing Foundation which sees many people from many different organizations and backgrounds contributing to the project now.</p>

<p>Where this becomes interesting is in the economic decision making that happens as a market is formed around maintainership of projects. With many of the good things that will be introduced like being able to have more full-time freelance software developers available I’m sure there will be interesting economic issues that will be introduced. It’s my belief though that this controversy will be worked out in different ways through different principles that projects will choose. As an example today one of the most obvious problems in large projects today such as when SushiSwap forked Uniswap and started taking sushiswap in a different direction. However, the legitimacy of the fork will help to form interesting economic behaviors on whether or not the value of the fork will go up like SushiSwap has shown by adding new and interesting contributions to their fork, or whether it will go down like many of the random clone projects that often lead to scams do.</p>

<p>I believe that if the mechanics of the maintainership role are established correctly then it may even be possible to create some interesting dynamics to reduce forking by leveraging the market dynamics. As an example if the DAO fork was required to mint the same number of tokens in the new project as the original project and make them assigned to the same maintainers then the original maintainers of the project could leverage their newly minted tokens in the new project in order to outright reject all proposals in the fork and slow down the momentum of the project. I tend to think this may be bad for innovation, but it’s an interesting example of how leveraging markets to make maintainership decisions can be utilized to build sustainability in open source development given that maintainership status of projects has legitimate value that if broken up and governed properly could be leveraged to reshape how software development is funded.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/14745765789"></a>Since <a href="https://www.legacy.com/ca/obituaries/theglobeandmail/name/kim-cameron-obituary?pid=200830800&amp;__cf_chl_captcha_tk__=vxIVvG6O.QvgP3hV8.iTPhw89IS27Qv8JsoIlvuoo1s-1639851363-0-gaNycGzNCr0">Kim’s passing</a>, I’ve been reflecting on his impact on my life and remembering some of the things that made him special.  Here’s a few stories I’d like to tell in his honor.</p>
<p>Kim was more important to my career and life than most people know.  Conversations with him in early 2005 led me to leave Microsoft Research and join his quest to “Build the Internet’s missing identity layer” – a passion that still motivates me to this day.</p>
<p>Within days of me joining the identity quest, Kim asked me to go with him to the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/sets/72157720211859061">first gathering of the Identity Gang</a> at PC Forum in Scottsdale, Arizona.  Many of the people that I met there remain important in my professional and personal life!  The <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/iiw2005/">first Internet Identity Workshop</a> soon followed.</p>
<p>Kim taught me a lot about building positive working relationships with others.  Early on, he told me to always try to find something nice to say to others.  Showing his devious sense of humor, he said “Even if you are sure that their efforts are doomed to fail because of fatal assumptions on their part, you can at least say to them ‘You’re working on solving a really important problem!’ :-)”  He modelled by example that consensus is much easier to achieve when you make allies rather than enemies.  And besides, it’s a lot more fun for everyone that way!</p>
<p>Kim was always generous with his time and hospitality and lots of fun to be around.  I remember he and Adele inviting visitors from Deutsche Telekom to their home overlooking the water in Bellevue.  He organized a night at the opera for identity friends in Munich.  He took my wife Becky and I and Tony Nadalin out to dinner at his favorite restaurant in Paris, La Coupole.  He and Adele were the instigators behind many a fun evening.  He had a love of life beyond compare!</p>
<p>At one point in my career, I was hoping to switch to a manager more supportive of my passion for standards work, and asked Kim if I could work for him.  I’ll always remember his response: “Having you work for me would be great, because I wouldn’t have to manage you.  But the problem is that then they’d make me have others work for me too.  Managing people would be the death of me!”</p>
<p>This blog exists because Kim encouraged me to blog.</p>
<p>I once asked Kim why there were so many Canadians working in digital identity.  He replied: “Every day as a Canadian, you think ‘What is it that makes me uniquely Canadian, as opposed to being American?  Whereas Americans never give it a thought.  Canadians are always thinking about identity.'”</p>
<p>Kim was a visionary and a person of uncommon common sense.  His Information Card paradigm was ahead of its time.  For instance, the “selecting cards within a wallet” metaphor that Windows CardSpace introduced is now widespread – appearing in platform and Web account selectors, as well as emerging “self-sovereign identity” wallets, containing digital identities that you control.  The demos people are giving now sure look a lot like InfoCard demos from back in the day!</p>
<p>Kim was a big believer in privacy and giving people control over their own data (see the <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/stories/2005/05/13/TheLawsOfIdentity.pdf">Laws of Identity</a>).  He championed the effort for Microsoft to acquire and use the U-Prove selective disclosure technology, and to make it freely available for others to use.</p>
<p>Kim was hands-on.  To get practical experience with OpenID Connect, he wrote a complete OpenID Provider in 2018 and even got it certified!  You can see the certification entry at <a href="https://openid.net/certification/">https://openid.net/certification/</a> for the “IEF Experimental Claimer V0.9” that he wrote.</p>
<p>Kim was highly valued by Microsoft’s leaders (and many others!).  He briefly retired from Microsoft most of a decade ago, only to have the then-Executive Vice President of the Server and Tools division, Satya Nadella, immediately seek him out and ask him what it would take to convince him to return.  Kim made his asks, the company agreed to them, and he was back within about a week.  One of his asks resulted in the AAD business-to-customer (B2C) identity service in production use today.  He also used to have regular one-on-ones with Bill Gates.</p>
<p>Kim wasn’t my mentor in any official capacity, but he was indeed my mentor in fact. I believe he saw potential in me and chose to take me under his wing and help me develop in oh so many ways. I’ll always be grateful for that, and most of all, for his friendship.</p>
<p>In September 2021 at the European Identity and Cloud (EIC) conference in Munich, <a href="https://twitter.com/JacksonShaw">Jackson Shaw</a> and I remarked to each other that neither of us had heard from Kim in a while.  I reached out to him, and he responded that his health was failing, without elaborating.  Kim and I talked for a while on the phone after that.  He encouraged me that the work we are doing now is really important, and to press forward quickly.</p>
<p>On October 25, 2021, <a href="https://twitter.com/vibronet">Vittorio Bertocci</a> organized an informal CardSpace team reunion in Redmond.  Kim wished he could come but his health wasn’t up to travelling.  Determined to include him in a meaningful way, I called him on my phone during the reunion and Kim spent about a half hour talking to most of the ~20 attendees in turn.  They shared stories and laughed!  As Vittorio said to me when we learned of his passing, we didn’t know then that we were saying goodbye.</p>
 
<p>P.S.  Here’s a few of my favorite photos from the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/sets/72157720211859061">first event that Kim included me in</a>:</p>

<p>In 2018, all European member states, together with Norway and Lichtenstein, signed a declaration stating the joint ambition to take advantage of blockchain technology. These 29 countries founded the European Blockchain Partnership (EBP), and within this partnership, they decided to build the so-called European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI).</p><p>EBSI was created aiming to, on the one hand, provide blockchain capabilities used by the partner of the EPB to implement and realize blockchain projects and use cases within these countries. Moreover, on the other hand, to achieve certain use cases on a European level. The so-called use case groups were defined and present the working groups related to a specific use case to support the latter idea. These use case groups consist of representatives of the EBP member counties, domain experts as well as the European Commission.</p><p>Initially, four use case groups were founded, namely the European Self-Sovereign Identity Framework (ESSIF), the diploma use case, document traceability, and secure document transfer. ESSIF focuses on digital identities where the user is in control over her identity data. The diploma use case focuses on educational diplomas of students and related processes such as issuing, verifying, revocation, and all of these processes in cross-border scenarios. Document traceability considers the anchoring of document-related identifiers like hashes on the blockcahin and secure document sharing on tax-related information transfer.</p><p>EBSI defined so-called use case groups that should be achieved using the provided capabilities to showcase their functionality and bring in expertise in the specific fields. Each use case group consists of representatives of the member states, domain experts, and the European Commission.</p> About EBSI4Austria <p>EBSI4Austria is a CEF funded project with two main objectives. First, EBSI4Austria aims to set up, operate and maintain the Austrian’s EBSI node. Second, we pilot the diploma use case on the Austrian level supported by two Universities and data providers as well as verifiers.</p><p>EBSI created a so-called early adopter program to speed up the use case integration of the participating countries. EBSI4Austria joined this ambiguous program already in the first wave reflecting our project’s motivation.</p> Partners <p>EBSI4Austria consists of three partners, namely two Universities such as <a href="https://www.tugraz.at/">Graz University of Technology (TU Graz)</a> and the <a href="https://www.wu.ac.at/">Vienna University of Economics (WU Vienna)</a>, together with <a href="https://danubetech.com/">Danube Tech</a>, a Vienna based company that provides leading expertise in Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) as well as distributed systems and is involved in related standardization bodies. The Universities are responsible for issuing students’ diplomas and also verifying them. Austrian’s EBSI node is set up and operated at the department eGovernment innovation center (EGIZ), which is part of Graz University of technology.</p> User Story <p>Figure 1 illustrates the user story that is covered in our project. A student studying at the Graz University of Technology is finishing her bachelor’s program. TU Graz issues her diploma credential stating her bachelor’s degree, which the student stores in her wallet. Next, she wants to apply for a master’s program at the Vienna University of Economics and Business; thus, she presents her bachelor’s diploma credential. After successfully finishing her master’s program at WU Vienna, the university issues her master’s diploma credential to the student. The student is very ambitious; therefore, she applies for a Ph.D. position at the Berlin Institute of Technology by presenting her diplomas. All involved parties utilize the EBSI blockchain network to verify if the issuing universities are trusted&nbsp;issuers.</p>Figure 1: User Story of the Diploma Use&nbsp;Case Technology <p>In order to implement our EBSI4Austria project, we used similar technologies as many other Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) initiatives, i.e., based on building blocks such as Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs).</p><p>We created two DIDs on the EBSI blockchain for the two universities, as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Test DID for TU Graz: <a href="https://dev.uniresolver.io/#did:ebsi:zuoS6VfnmNLduF2dynhsjBU">did:ebsi:zuoS6VfnmNLduF2dynhsjBU</a>  Test DID for WU Vienna: <a href="https://dev.uniresolver.io/#did:ebsi:z23EQVGi5so9sBwytv6nMXMo">did:ebsi:z23EQVGi5so9sBwytv6nMXMo</a>  <p>In addition, we registered them in EBSI’s Trusted Issuer Registry&nbsp;(TIR).</p><p>We also designed Verifiable Credentials to model digital versions of university diplomas. We implemented them using different credential and proof formats to accommodate changing requirements and guidelines in the EBSI specifications throughout the year.

This multi-university pilot should underpin the possibilities even across countries.</p><p>While working on the MU pilot, we participated in several EBSI Early Adopter program meetings to identify issuers, verifiers, and types of credentials. We were in contact with members of Spanish EBSI pilot projects (especially from the SSI company Gataca), to compare our approaches to EBSI DIDs and Verifiable Credentials. We had several technical discussions and email exchanges regarding details of those credentials, e.g. about the JSON-LD contexts and exact proof formats we were planning to use. During these exchanges, we were able to exchange initial examples of verifiable credentials and verify&nbsp;them.</p><p>Within one of the “clusters” of the EBSI MU pilot, we also collaborated closely with the “UniCert” aka “EBSI4Germany” project led by the Technical University of Berlin, a member of the EBSI early adopter program and the German IDunion consortium. This collaboration proved to be particularly interesting for the following reasons:</p><p>1. Since TU Berlin participates both in EBSI and IDunion, they have unique insights into the similarities and differences between these different SSI networks.</p><p>2. TU Berlin was also able to share some experiences regarding the use of existing standards such as Europass and ELMO/EMREX, which can help with semantic interoperability of Verifiable Credentials use in&nbsp;EBSI.</p>Figure 2: Multi-university pilot scenario.<p>Note: This blog post was co-authored by Andreas Abraham (<a href="https://www.egiz.gv.at/">eGovernment Innovation Center</a>) and Markus Sabadello (<a href="https://danubetech.com/">Danube Tech</a>).

   It is suggested that all which glitters is gold when it comes to data: the more data, the better. I have challenged this thinking that more data is better on numerous occasions, and essentially they all come to the same point. Data volume does not lead to better decisions.&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>A “simplistic” graph is doing the rounds (again) and is copied below. The two-axis links the quality of a decision and the person's capability with data.&nbsp; It infers that boards, executives and senior leadership need to be “data-savvy” if they are to make better decisions. Data Savvy is a position between being “data-naive or data-devoid” and “drunk on data.”&nbsp; The former has no data or skills; the latter is too much data or cannot use the tools. Data Savvy means you are skilled with the correct data and the right tools.</p><p>This thinking is driven by those trying to sell data training by simplifying a concept to such a point its becomes meaningless but is easy to sell/ buy and looks great as a visual.&nbsp; When you don’t have enough time to reflect on the graph and the message, it looks logical, inspired and correct - it is none of these things. &nbsp; The basis of the idea is that a board or senior leadership team who are data-savvy will make better decisions, based on the framing that if you are naive or drunk on data, you will make poor decisions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The first issue I have is that if the data does not have <a href="https://opengovernance.net/updating-board-paper-for-a-data-attestation-section-db59d736ccc5">attestation</a>, your capability (data-savviness) will make no difference to the quality of the decision. &nbsp;One could argue that you will test the data if data-savvy, but this is also untrue as most boards cannot test the data, relying on the organisations' processes and procedures to ensure “quality” data. This is a wild assumption.&nbsp;</p><br><p></p><p>It is worth searching for what “data-savvy” means and reading a few articles.&nbsp; You will find that many put becoming data-savvy as a step in the journey to being data-driven.&nbsp; To a second point:&nbsp; data-driven means you will always be late.&nbsp; To wait for enough data to reduce the risk to match your risk framework means that you will be late in the decision-making process.&nbsp; Data-driven does not make you fast, agile, ahead, innovative or adaptive. &nbsp; <a href="https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/2021/12/hard-fast-vs-late-slow.html">Data-driven makes you late, slow, behind and a follower.</a></p><p>Is the reality of wanting to be data-savvy or a desire to be data-driven that you look to use data to reduce risk and therefore become more risk-averse, which means you miss the <a href="https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/2021/06/the-shadowy-hierarchy.html">signals</a> that would make you genuinely innovative?</p><p>The question as a CDO (data or digital) we should reflect on is “how do we reconcile that we want to be first, innovative, creative or early; but our processes, methods, and tools depend on data that means we will always be late!” The more innovative we want to be, the less data we will have and the more risk we need to take, which does not align to the leadership, culture or rewards/ incentives that we have or operate to.</p>

<blockquote><p>“We know now that technology and business models are accelerating at a faster pace than ever before in human history. In 10 years time, who knows what kind of conversations we’re going to be having, but the one thing we know is that we’re all going to be increasingly vulnerable, as more of our services, more of our citizen identity, move online.” – Surash Patel, VP EMEA, TeleSign Corporation 2021 (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5WlrHSohpM&amp;t=1569s)">click here to listen</a>).1</p></blockquote>
 
 <p></p>
<p>I recently sat down with &nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/surashpatel/?originalSubdomain=uk">Surash Patel, VP EMEA</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.telesign.com/">TeleSign</a>&nbsp;and Board Member of the&nbsp;<a href="https://mobileecosystemforum.com/about/global-board/">Mobile Ecosystem Forum (MEF)</a>&nbsp;to discuss the personal data &amp; identity (PD&amp;I) market, for a PD&amp;I market assessment report I’m working on for the MEF (the report will be out in January 2022).&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5WlrHSohpM&amp;t=1569s">Surash’s above quote</a>&nbsp;stuck out to me because I think he is right. It also reminds me of another quote, one from WPP:</p>
<blockquote><p>“By 2030 society will no longer tolerate a business model that relies on mass transactions of increasingly sensitive personal data: a quite different system will be in place.” – WPP2</p></blockquote>
<p>I took away three key insights, although are more, from my interview with Surash:</p>
 
 Enterprises must immediately start learning how to master [mobile] identity verification; mobile identity verification can help reduce losses to fraud and self-inflicted losses of revenue. 
 Enterprises that effectively use mobile identity verification can create value and generate trust and engagement at every stage of the customer journey. 
 There is much we—people, private organizations, and public institutions—need to know and do to equip for the now and prepare for the future. 
 
<p>The following summarizes my conversation with Surash. . To watch the complete interview with Surash Patel of TeleSign (39:11 min),&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5WlrHSohpM">click here</a>.</p>
 Risk Mitigation, Value Creation, and the Customer Journey 
<p>When introducing himself and his background, Surash opened with a wonderfully self-reflective quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I completely missed a trick on my career and where it was going, in that I thought about the value exchange between the consumer and the brand. From a marketing perspective, I never really considered it from the digital identity perspective before–seeing the numbers on digital fraud right now I think that case is becoming more and more clear to me.” – Surash Patel, VP EMEA, Telesign Corporation 2021&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5WlrHSohpM&amp;t=50s">click here</a>).</p></blockquote>
<p>By reading between the lines of his statement, I gather that, as a marketer, he previously saw identity as a tool for audience targeting and promotion. But, once he went into the infrastructure side of the business, he realized identity plays an even bigger role throughout the industry. This is because identity has a critical role at every touchpoint along the customer journey–not just for marketing, but for fraud prevention, revenue protection, and trust.</p>
 Risk Mitigation and managing losses 
<p>Drawing from industry reports, Surash notes that&nbsp;t&nbsp;<a href="https://www.javelinstrategy.com/content/2021-identity-fraud-report-shifting-angles-identity-fraud">businesses are losing upwards of $56 billion a year to fraud each year</a>.4&nbsp;Because of this, “knowing your customer,” i.e., knowing that there is a legitimate human on the other side of a digital transaction, is not just a nice to have, but a business imperative. Surash points out that it’s not just fraud that brands must contend with when it comes to losses. They must also contend with self-inflicted wounds.</p>
<p>Surash referenced a report from&nbsp;<a href="http://file///Users/michaelbecker/Dropbox/MEF%20PD&amp;I%20Mkt%20Assessment%20Materials/Becker%20Articles/Under_Review/%5Bhttps://www.checkout.com/connected-payments/black-boxes-and-paradoxes%5D(https://www.checkout.com/connected-payments/black-boxes-and-paradoxes)">Checkout.com</a>&nbsp;which found that, in 2019, brands in the UK, US, France, and Germany lost $20.3 billion in 2019 due to false declines at check out, i.e.&nbsp;identity verification system failures. $12.7 billion of these losses went to competitors, while $7.6 billion just evaporated.5&nbsp;My takeaway from this is that it’s necessary for brands to see identity verification as a strategic imperative, not just an IT function.</p>
<p>But, reducing fraud and managing revenue breakage is not all Surash brought up. He also noted that, based on findings in the Checkout.com report, consumers would pay an average of $4 to be sure their transactions are secure. So, not only can brands reduce fraud, but they can also retain sales by more effectively identifying their customers (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5WlrHSohpM&amp;t=693s">listen to his comments here</a>).</p>
 The Potential For Harm is Real and Must Be Managed 
<p>Let’s briefly return to Surash’s quote above:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We know now that technology and, you know, business models are accelerating at a faster pace than ever before in human history. In 10 years time, who knows what kind of conversations we’re going to be having, but the one thing we know is that we’re all going to be increasingly vulnerable as more of our services, more of a citizen identity, move online.” – Surash Patel, VP EMEA, Telesign Corporation 2021 (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5WlrHSohpM&amp;t=1569s">click here to listen</a>).6</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree with him–the people, not just businesses, are at risk of being even more vulnerable than they are now, but that does not mean the risks we face today are trivial. Harm from the misuse of personal data is all around us. We primarily measure this in financial terms. For example, in 2020,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aarp.org/money/scams-fraud/info-2021/texts-smartphone.html">U.S. consumers reported losses of $86M to fraud originating from text messaging scams</a>&nbsp;.7</p>
 On harm 
<p>There is&nbsp;<a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/cybersecurity/459427-privacy-law-needs-privacy-harm">more privacy harm out there than financial loss</a>, noted by Ignacio N. Cofone,8 and it is not a trivial discussion to be slipped under the rug. In fact, it is one of the fundamental drivers behind emerging people-centric regulations, industry best practices, and the reshaping of law.</p>
<p>This topic is too big to cover in this article, but I can provide a good resource for you on privacy harm. One of my go-to resources when considering this issue is&nbsp;<a href="https://teachprivacy.com/">Daniel Solove</a>, who recently, along with Danielle Keates Citron, updated the&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3782222">Typology of Privacy Harms</a>. This is a must-read if you are a student on the topic of being of service to the connected individual.</p>
 The Customer Journey and Balance of Power Shift 
<p>To address these privacy harms, Surash specifically calls for the government to get involved. However, Surash thinks brands and individuals alike can do more as well. Surash makes it clear that individuals need to be more aware and accountable for their own actions and interactions. He also thinks, however, that brands need to learn to engage people in an even value exchange (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5WlrHSohpM&amp;t=774s">hear Surash’s comment</a>). Furthermore, he recognizes that people are taking more control of their data, and as this continues, we may eventually see the evolution of consumer “curation services &nbsp;(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5WlrHSohpM&amp;t=1527s">hear his remark</a>),” what may call “infomediaries.” Again, I’m drawn to the WPP quote above. Brands need to prepare for fundamental shifts in people’s attitudes and expectations. The implications of these shifts will be profound, as they will force a change in competition, business models, product offerings, and business practices.</p>
 There is Much We All Need to Know and Do 
<p>So, after taking all this in, what’s next?</p>
<p>What I learned from my time with Surash is that an effective identity management implementation can collectively save brands billions, while building trust and improving their ability to serve their customer throughout the customer’s journey.</p>
<p>Surash emphasized that the people must know that they are at risk and be aware of all that is going on in the industry. As a result of this knowledge, they can take steps to advocate for and protect themselves. He notes that individuals “absolutely need to know the value of their data” and “how they can challenge” the brands’ use of their data. Surash suggested that individuals need to start shifting the balance of power by approaching brands and questioning, “Do you really need that data to serve me? If not, don’t ask me for it.” Surash does recognize, however, that this is going to be hard for individuals to go up against the “large” brand. As noted below, we believe in both the companies’ and the government’s abilities to do more.</p>
<p>For brands, Surash wants them to:</p>
 
 Take cyberattacks seriously and prepare as the attacks are expected to get worse. 
 Get the fraud and marketing teams working together and not at loggerheads 
 Not just onboard individuals after the first transaction, but to continually evaluate and authenticate their customers as their customers move along the journey. He suggests that brands must learn to evaluate the local context of each engagement, regularly verify and authenticate their customers, and show the people they serve some respect by making an effort to validate if individuals’ circumstances (preferences, address, phone number, etc.) have changed over time. Surash implies that these actions will both reduce the risk of fraud and cybercrime, but also improve the relationship they have with those they serve. 
 Ensure there is always an even value exchange, and if the brand wants more in return during a transaction, e.g.&nbsp;more data to support a future upsell, then they should consider paying the individual for it. 
 
<p>As for public institutions, .e.g. governments, Surash suggests that “there isn’t enough being done to protect the consumers.” Governments should work with industry to refine value propositions, institute consistent standards, and advocate for consumers.</p>
<p>Clearly, this is all just the tip of the iceberg. There is definitely more to come.</p>

<p>Sunday, November 14, 2021</p>



<p>We got an early start, said good-bye to Celeste (who got to stay in the room a little longer), and headed for Paddington Station about 7 am to catch the <a href="https://www.heathrowexpress.com/#/">Heathrow Express</a>. We bought our tickets, got out on the platform, and were greeted with a message board saying that there were delays on the line and that some trains had been canceled. This made us a little nervous, but the Network Rail application on my phone reassured us that there would, in fact, be a train soon. Although we had a bit more than the usual wait for Heathrow Express, the train proceeded normally and was not excessively crowded.</p>



<p>After the usual long walk, we reached the ticket counter and checked in. They were thorough in checking our vaccination and COVID testing status, although not to the point of actually checking the QR codes associated with each. After checking bags, there was another long walk to the vicinity of the gate. United’s lounge in London is still closed, but in the meantime they have an arrangement with Singapore Airlines for the use of their lounge where we were able to get breakfast.</p>



<p>At the gate, Kenna was diverted for extra security screening because the “SSSS” designation was printed on her boarding pass. Following that inconvenience, our flight departed on time, which given that we have only a 2-hour layover in Chicago (including customs and immigration) we appreciated. However, our arrival gate was occupied by another plane, resulting in about a 30 minute delay which made us understandably nervous.</p>



<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2021/12/img_7860.jpg"></a>Greenland from the air



<p>Having seen US Customs signs back in San Francisco promoting the <a href="https://mobilepassport.us/">Mobile Passport</a> immigration application for our phones, we entered our passport information and customs declaration. But after racing to the immigration hall, we were told, “We don’t use that any more. Get in line.” More nervousness about the time. After getting through Customs (which left us outside security), we took the tram to Terminal 1 for our flight to San Francisco.</p>



<p>Here we noticed that Kenna didn’t have the TSA Precheck designation on her boarding card, probably as a result of the SSSS designation earlier. It may not have mattered; there were signs saying precheck was closed and the people checking boarding passes didn’t seem to know. So we both went through the “slow line”, and unfortunately Kenna set something off and had to go through some extra screening. Apparently they thought there was something about one of her shoes, which they ran through the X-ray machine again; more delay. It was interesting that there were a number of women having their shoes rechecked at the same time.</p>



<p>We raced to our gate, nearly the furthest from the security checkpoint, and made it in enough time, but with not much to spare. The ride to San Francisco was unremarkable, and we collected our bags and caught our ride home, according to plan.</p>



 Epilogue 



  
<p>Arriving home we were severely jet lagged as expected, but tried to stay up as late as we could manage. After a few hours of sleep, I awoke about 2 am. I could hear some water dripping, which I attributed to a downspout being clogged with leaves following some recent rainfall. So I got up to investigate, and instead discovered that there was a substantial amount of water dripping from the ceiling into our guest room. It turns out that a hot water pipe in the attic had developed a pinhole leak and over time had soaked one wall. So we now have a new project.</p>

<p>Saturday, November 13, 2021</p>



<p>London isn’t in Sussex, that’s just the theme of the trip.</p>



<p>Celeste expressed a lot of interest in visiting the <a href="https://www.iwm.org.uk/visits/iwm-london">Imperial War Museum</a>, which none of us had visited, so we decided to make that our first destination. After a quick <a href="https://www.pret.co.uk/en-GB">Pret a Manger</a> breakfast, we took the Tube to the south side of London. The first thing you notice is the battleship guns at the front. My interest was also piqued by a short segment of Berlin Wall near the front entrance.</p>



<p>The museum has a large collection on several floors, with areas emphasizing World War I, World War II, the Cold War, the Holocaust, etc. One could easily spend several days to see all of the exhibits. Toward the end of our visit, we went in to the World War II gallery (having already seen quite a number of exhibits dealing with WW II), and it went on…and on. The gallery was very large and went into great detail, including many stories about participants in the war, German as well as Allied. We hadn’t expected the gallery to be nearly as large as it was, and might have allocated more time if we had.</p>



<p>Early in the afternoon we tired of the museum and decided to look for lunch. We thought we might like German food, so guided by our phones, we walked north and came to <a href="https://www.mercatometropolitano.com/">Mercato Metropolitano</a>, a large semi-outdoor food court with sustainable food from many world cuisines. Each of us selected something we like, but we never found the German restaurant we thought was there.</p>



<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2021/12/img_7846x-1.jpg"></a>



<p>Continuing north, we got to the <a href="https://boroughmarket.org.uk/">Borough Market</a>, a large trading market established in 1756. Perhaps because it was a Saturday, it was very crowded. Normally this might not have been as notable but that since the COVID epidemic we have avoided and become unaccustomed to crowds. We walked through quickly and then continued on to the Thames, where we went along the south shore to the Millennium Bridge. We walked out on the bridge, took some pictures, and continued west to the Westminster Bridge. All along the way there were people — lots of people.</p>



<p>After crossing the Westminster bridge, we took a short Tube ride to the West End. Again, everything was crowded. We tried a couple of places for dinner, but nothing was available without an advance booking. The Five Guys burger restaurant was jammed, and there was even a long queue at McDonalds (!). We couldn’t figure out the attraction there.</p>



<p>We finally settled on <a href="https://www.itsu.com/">Itsu</a>, the same Asian-themed fast food chain that we had tried in Brighton. We were able to find a table and had an enjoyable light meal.</p>



  
<p>The big event of the day was this evening: we had tickets to <a href="https://www.backtothefuturemusical.com/">Back to the Future: The Musical</a>, playing at the <a href="https://lwtheatres.co.uk/theatres/adelphi/">Adelphi Theatre</a> on The Strand. This is a new show that that just opened in July 2021 and has not yet made it to the United States. The theatre was, as expected, nearly full. But we had been told that COVID vaccination, negative tests, and the wearing of masks would be required. In fact, we were never asked about vaccinations or tests, and the majority of the audience did not wear masks. We felt somewhat less safe as a result.</p>
  



<p>Still, the show was very enjoyable. As Celeste pointed out, this is a “tech show” with the strong point being special effects. Most of the performances, particularly Doc Brown, were excellent as well, although Celeste noted that some of the actors had trouble with American accents.</p>



<p>We took the Tube back to our hotel and are retiring quickly. Tomorrow will be an early day for Jim and Kenna’s flight back home.</p>

<p>Friday, November 12, 2021</p>



<p>Since it is now 2 days before our return to the United States, today was the day for our pre-trip COVID test. We were a little nervous about that because, of course, it determines whether we return as planned. Expecting a similar experience as for our Day 2 test, we were a bit surprised that this time we would have to do a proctored test where the proctor would watch us take the test via video chat. The next surprise was that you seem to need both a smartphone to run their app and some other device for the chat session. So we got out our iPads, and (third surprise) there was apparently a bug in their application causing it not to work on an iPad. So we got out my Mac laptop and (fourth surprise) couldn’t use my usual browser, Firefox, but could fortunately use Safari. Each test took about half an hour, including a 15-minute wait for the test to develop. Following the wait, a second video chat was set up where they read the test with you and issued your certificate. Very fortunately, both of our tests were negative.</p>



<p>We checked out of the apartment/hotel just before checkout time and stored our bags. Then the question was what to do until Celeste finished classes so we could all take the train to London. The answer was the <a href="https://www.visitsealife.com/brighton/">Sea Life Brighton</a>, apparently the oldest aquarium in the world. While not an extensive collection, many of the exhibits were in a classic style with ornate frames supporting the glass windows. There was a very enjoyable tunnel where you can sit while fish (and turtles!) swim overhead. The aquarium covered a number of regions of the world, with more of an emphasis on fresh-water fish than many others we have seen.</p>




<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2021/12/img_7817.jpg"></a>



<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2021/12/img_7828-1.jpg"></a>




<p>After browsing a bookstore for a while, we collected our bags and headed for the train station. Trains run to Victoria Station in London every half hour, and fortunately that connected well with the train Celeste took from Falmer to meet us.</p>



<p>After the train trip and Tube ride to Paddington Station, we walked the short distance to our hotel, a newly renovated boutique hotel called <a href="https://www.inhabithotels.com/">Inhabit</a>. We chose it largely because it had nice triple rooms, including an actual bed (not sofa bed) for Celeste. No London trip would be complete without a hotel where it’s necessary to lug your bags up a flight of stairs, but fortunately this one only required a single flight. Our room was modern and comfortable.</p>



<p>I had booked a table at the <a href="https://www.victoriapaddington.co.uk/">Victoria</a>, a pub in the Paddington area, and we were seated in a pleasant and not noisy dining room upstairs. Dinner was excellent. Upon returning to the hotel, Celeste immediately collapsed for the night on her cozy bed.</p>

<p>Thursday, November 11, 2021</p>



<p>While Celeste was in classes, Kenna and I set out on foot for Hove, Brighton’s “twin” city to the west. We had a rather pleasant walk through a shopping district, but there wasn’t much remarkable to see. In Hove, we turned south and followed the main road along the Channel back to the west. We stopped to look at one of the characteristic crescent-shaped residential developments, and continued toward Brighton. We considered going on the <a href="https://britishairwaysi360.com/">i360</a> observation tower, but it wasn’t particularly clear and the expense didn’t seem worth it.</p>



<p>Celeste and a friend of hers (another exchange student from Colorado) joined us in the afternoon to go ice skating at the <a href="https://royalpavilionicerink.co.uk/">Royal Pavilion Ice Rink</a>. While I am used to hockey skates, it was a bit of an adjustment to the others who are used to the toe picks on figure skates. We all got the hang of it; the ice was beautifully maintained (although with some puddles) and the rink was not particularly crowded for our 3 pm session.</p>

<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2021/12/img_4511.jpeg"></a>




<p>After skating we sat in the attached cafe to chat until it was time for dinner, which we had at an Italian restaurant, <a href="https://www.bellaitalia.co.uk/italian-restaurant/brighton/market-street#!">Bella Italia</a>, in the Lanes.</p>

<p>Wednesday, November 10, 2021</p>



<p>Celeste has a busy class schedule the early part of the day, so Kenna and I set out on our own, first for a hearty breakfast at <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186273-d467437-Reviews-Billie_s_Cafe-Brighton_East_Sussex_England.html">Billie’s Cafe</a> and then to the <a href="https://brightonmuseums.org.uk/royalpavilion/">Royal Pavilion</a>, one of the sightseeing highlights of Brighton. Originally a country estate, it was remodeled by King George IV into an ornate building, with the exterior having an Indian theme and the interior extensively decorated and furnished in Chinese style.</p>



<p>Brighton’s Royal Pavilion has had a varied history, having been of less interest to Queen Victoria (George IV’s successor in the throne) who moved most of the furnishings to London and sold the building to the City of Brighton. Over the years it has been refurnished in the original style and with many of the original furnishings, some of which have been loaned by Queen Elizabeth. The Pavilion was in the process of being decorated for Christmas, which reminded us of a visit we made two years ago to <a href="https://filoli.org/">Filoli</a> in California.</p>

<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2021/11/img_7770-1.jpg"></a>




<p>After the Pavilion, we went across the garden to the Brighton Museum, which had a wide range of exhibits ranging from ancient history of the British Isles and ancient Egypt to LGBT styles of the late 20th century and modern furniture.</p>



<p>Having finished her classes, Celeste joined us for lunch at <a href="https://www.itsu.com/">Itsu</a>, one of a chain of Asian-inspired fast food restaurants. We then returned with Celeste to the museum to see a bit more and allow her time to do some research she had planned.</p>



<p>We then made our way behind the Pavilion, where a seasonal ice rink is set up for recreational ice skating. With its location next to the Pavilion it is a particularly scenic place to skate. We are looking forward to doing that tomorrow.</p>



<p>Celeste returned to campus, and Kenna and I, having had a substantial lunch, opted for a light dinner at <a href="https://www.tengreenbottles.com/">Ten Green Bottles</a>, a local wine bar.</p>

  The title might sound like a movie but this article is about unpacking decision making.  <br><br>We need leaders to be confident in their decisions so we can hold them accountable.  We desire leaders to lead, wanting them to be early. They achieve this by listening to the signals and reacting before is is obvious to the casual observer.  However, those in leadership who we hold accountable do not want to make the “wrong” decisions. A wrong decision can mean liability, loss of reputation or perceived to be too risky.  A long senior leadership career requires navigating a careful path between not takingtoo much risk by going too “early”, which leads to failure, and not being late such that anyone could have made the decision earlier and looking incompetent.  Easy leadership does not look like leadership as it finds a path of not being early or late (the majority)<br><br><br><br>When we unpack leadership trends over the past 100 years that include ideas such as improving margin, diversification, reduction, speed to market, finance lead decisions, data-led, customer first, agile, just-in-time, customer centricity, digital first, personalisation, automated decisions, innovation, transformation, ethics, diversity, privacy by design, shareholder primacy, stakeholder management, re-engineering, outsourcing to name a few.  Over the same period of time our ideas of leadership styles has also evolved. <br><br><a href="https://draft.blogger.com/#"></a><br><br>There is an inference or hypothesis that we can test, which is that our approach to risk means we have the leaders that we now deserve. Does our risk create the leadersghip we have or does leadership manage risk to what we want is a cause and effect problem that results from the complex market we have. <br><br>The Ladder of Inference below is a concept developed by the late Harvard Professor Chris Argyris, to help explain why anyone reading this and looking at (the same/a) set of evidence we can draw very different conclusions. However, the point is that what we want leadership who has the courage for decisions that are “hard and fast”, but what we get “late and slow”   Data led, waiting for the data, following the model all confirm that the decisions we are taking are late and slow.  We know there is a gap, it is just hard to know why.  Hard and fast occurs when there is a lack of data or evidence and rests on judgment and not confirmation, the very things we value but peanilse for at the same time.<br><br><a href="https://draft.blogger.com/#"></a><br><br><br><br>Right now we see this with how the government have reacted to COVID, again we can conclude with hindsight that no-one country leadership got it right and the majority appear to continuen to get it wrong in the view that the voters will not vote from them if they take the hard choices, follow the science, follow the data making sure we are late and slow.<br><br>Climate change and COP26.  There will never be enough data and waiting for more data confirms our need to manage to a risk model that does not account for the environment with the same weight as finance.  <br><br>Peak Paradox<br><br>The Peak Paradox framework forces us to address the question “what are we optimising for?”  Previous articles have highlighted the issues about decision making at Peak Paradox, however at each point we should also consider the leadership style “Hard &amp; Fast versus Late &amp; Slow”<br><br><br><br><br><br>The Peak Paradox model gives us a position in space, at each point where we are, thinking about hard &amp; fast vs late and slow introduces a concept of time and direction into the model.<br><br>

<p>Tuesday, November 9, 2021</p>



<p>Somewhat at the midpoint of our trip, it was time to take care of a few things like laundry. It’s also time for the thrice-annual <a href="https://www.ietf.org/">Internet Engineering Task Force</a> meeting, which was supposed to be in Madrid, but is being held online (again) due to the pandemic. I co-chaired a session from noon to 2 pm local time today, so I needed to be at the hotel for that. Meanwhile Kenna and Celeste did some exploring around the little shops in the Brighton Lanes.</p>



<p>Our downtime day also gave us an opportunity to do some laundry. One of the attractive features of our “aparthotel” is a compact combination washer/dryer. Our room also came with a couple of detergent pods, which were unfortunately and unexpectedly heavily scented. We will be using our own detergent in the future. The dryer was slow, but it did the job.</p>



<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2021/11/img_4493x.jpg"></a>IETF virtual venue



<p>I am again thankful for the good internet service here; the meeting went without a hitch (my co-chair is in Melbourne, Australia). Kenna and Celeste brought lunch from <a href="https://www.pret.co.uk/en-GB">Pret a Manger</a> to eat between meeting sessions I needed to attend. Following the second session we went off for dinner at a pizza place we had discovered, <a href="https://www.francomanca.co.uk/">Franco Manca</a>. The pizza and surroundings were outstanding; we would definitely return (and Celeste probably will). We then saw Celeste off to her bus back to campus and we returned to our hotel.</p>

<p>A little over a year ago, I switched roles at Oracle and joined the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Product Management team working on Identity and Access Management (IAM) services. It's been an incredibly interesting (and challenging) year leading up to our release of <a href="https://www.oracle.com/security/cloud-security/identity-cloud/">OCI IAM identity domains</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>We merged an enterprise-class Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS) solution with our OCI-native IAM service to create a cloud platform IAM service unlike any other. We encountered numerous challenges along the way that would have been much easier if we allowed for customer interruption. But we had a key goal to not cause any interruptions or changes in functionality to our thousands of existing IDaaS customers. It's been immeasurably impressive to watch the development organization attack and conquer those challenges.<br></p><p>Now, with a few clicks from the OCI admin console, customers can create self-contained IDaaS instances to accommodate a variety of IAM use-cases. And this is just the beginning. The new, upgraded OCI IAM service serves as the foundation for what's to come. And I've never been more optimistic about Oracle's future in the IAM space.</p><p>Here's a short excerpt from our blog post <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/cloudsecurity/post/introducing-oci-iam-identity-domains">Introducing OCI IAM Identity Domains</a>:<br></p><p></p><blockquote><p>"Over the past five years, Oracle Identity  Cloud Service (IDCS) has grown to support thousands of customers and  currently manages hundreds of millions of identities. Current IDCS  customers enjoy a broad set of Identity and Access Management (IAM)  features for authentication (federated, social, delegated, adaptive, multi-factor authentication (MFA)), access management, manual or automated identity lifecycle and entitlement management, and single sign-on (SSO) (federated, gateways, proxies, password vaulting).</p> <p>In addition to serving IAM use cases for workforce and consumer  access scenarios, IDCS has frequently been leveraged to enhance IAM  capabilities for <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/">Oracle Cloud Infrastructure</a>&nbsp;(OCI) workloads. The <a href="https://www.oracle.com/security/cloud-security/identity-cloud/">OCI Identity and Access Management (OCI IAM)</a> service, a native OCI service that provides the access control plane  for Oracle Cloud resources (networking, compute, storage, analytics,  etc.), has provided the IAM framework for OCI via authentication, access  policies, and integrations with OCI security approaches such as <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingcompartments.htm">compartments and tagging</a>.  OCI customers have adopted IDCS for its broader authentication options,  identity lifecycle management capabilities, and to provide a seamless  sign-on experience for end users that extends beyond the Oracle Cloud.</p> <p>To better address Oracle customers’ IAM requirements and to simplify  access management across Oracle Cloud, multi-cloud, Oracle enterprise  applications, and third-party applications, Oracle has merged IDCS and  OCI IAM into a single, unified cloud service that brings all of IDCS’  advanced identity and access management features natively into the OCI  IAM service. To align with Oracle Cloud branding, the unified IAM  service will leverage the OCI brand and will be offered as OCI IAM. Each instance of the OCI IAM service will be managed as identity domains in the OCI console."</p></blockquote><p></p><p><a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/cloudsecurity/post/introducing-oci-iam-identity-domains">Learn more about OCI IAM identity domains</a> <br></p>

<p>Monday, November 8, 2021</p>



<p>We started our day fairly early, getting a quick Starbucks breakfast before getting on the bus to University of Sussex to meet Celeste at 9:30 am. Celeste has an hour-long radio show, “Oops That Had Banjos”, on the campus radio station, <a href="https://www.urfonline.com/">University Radio Falmer</a>. She invited us to co-host the show. The studio was exactly as I had imagined, and it was a lot of fun doing the show with her. We each contributed a couple of songs to the playlist, and got to introduce them briefly.</p>



<p>After the show, Celeste had classes so we continued on to Lewes. We hadn’t been able to see much on our short visit Sunday evening. We started out at <a href="https://sussexpast.co.uk/attraction/lewes-castle-museum/">Lewes Castle &amp; Museum</a>, again getting an idea of the history of the place and then visiting portions of the castle itself. It was a clear day, and the view from the top was excellent. As with many of these sites, the castle went through many changes through the centuries as political conditions changed.</p>

<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2021/11/img_7759-1.jpg"></a>
Lewes Barbican Gate and view from the Castle



<p>After climbing around the castle, we were ready for lunch. We checked out a few restaurants in town before settling on the Riverside Cafe, in an attractive area on the River Ouse. After lunch, we walked among a number of small shops before entering a <a href="https://www.waterstones.com/">Waterstones bookstore</a>. How we miss spending time in quality bookstores! I expect we’ll be seeking them out more once we return.</p>



<p>We then took the train back to Brighton, since I had a meeting to attend for work. The meeting went well; the internet connection at the hotel is solid and makes it seem like it hardly matters where in the world I am when attending these meetings.</p>



<p>Celeste came down to Brighton to have dinner with us. We decided to go with Latin American food at a local chain called Las Iguanas. The food was quite good although somewhat standard, at least to those of us from California and Colorado.</p>

  <p>Update Feb 04, 2022: It looks like I was entirely correct with this November post.
Facebook is out of new users, over 10 billion in metaverse investments have nothing to
show for it yet, and the markets have caught up, dropping the stock by $200 billion in a
day. To make things worse, Zuckerberg supposedly said “focus on video” in the all-hands
on the same day. He chickened out; he should have doubled down on the metaverse story if
he truly believes it. But he did not.</p>
<p>The more I think about Facebook’s Meta’s pivot to the metaverse, the less it appears
like they do this voluntarily. I think they have no other choice: their existing
business is running out of steam. Consider:</p>
 
 
<p>At about
<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/">3.5 billion month active users</a>
of at least one of their products (Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp etc),
they are running out of more humans to sign up.</p>
 
 
<p>People say they use Facebook to
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2011/12/22/using-social-media-to-keep-in-touch/">stay in touch with family and friends</a>.
But there is now one ad in my feed for each three or four posts that I actually want to
see. Add more ads than this, and users will turn their backs: Facebook doesn’t help
them with what they want help with any more, it’s all ads.</p>
 
 
<p>While their ARPU is <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/251328/facebooks-average-revenue-per-user-by-region/">much higher in the US</a>
than in Europe, where in turn it is much higher than the rest of the world – hinting that
international growth should be possible – their distribution of ARPU is not all that
different from the whole ad market’s
<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/258071/global-advertising-spending-by-region/">distribution of ad revenues in different regions</a>.
Convincing, say, Africa to spend much more on ads does not sound like a growth story.</p>
 
 
<p>And between the regulators in the EU and elsewhere, moves to effectively ban further
Instagram-like acquisitions, lawsuits left and right, and Apple’s privacy moves, their
room to manoever is getting tighter, not wider.</p>
 
 
<p>Their current price/sales ratio of <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FB/key-statistics?p=FB">just under 10</a>
is hard to be justified for long under these constraints. They must also be telling themselves
that relying on an entirely ad-based business model is not good long-term strategy any
more, given the backlash against surveillance capitalism.</p>
<p>So what do you do?</p>
<p>I think you change the fundamentals of your business at the same time you change the
conversation, leveraging the technology you own. And you end up with:</p>
 
 
<p>Oculus as the replacement for the mobile phone;</p>
 
 
<p>Headset and app store sales, for Oculus, as an entirely new business model that’s
been proven (by the iPhone) to be highly profitable and is less under attack by regulators
and the public; it also supports potentially much higher ARPU than just ads;</p>
 
 
<p>Renaming the company to something completely harmless and bland sounding; that will also
let you drop the Facebook brand should it become too toxic down the road.</p>
 
 
<p>The risks are immense, starting with: how many hours a day do you hold your mobile phone
in your hand, in comparison to how many hours a day you are willing to wear a bucket
on your head, ahem, a headset? Even fundamental interaction questions, architecture questions
and use case questions for the metaverse are still completely up in the air.</p>
<p>Credit to Mark Zuckerberg for pulling off a move as substantial as this for an
almost trillion dollar company. I can’t think of any company which has ever done anything
similar at this scale. When Intel pivoted from memory to CPUs, back in the 1980’s and at
a much smaller scale, at least it was clear that there was going to be significant, growing
demand for CPUs. This is not clear at all about headsets beyond niches such as gaming.
So they are really jumping into the unknown with both feet.</p>
<p>But I don’t think any more they had a choice.</p>

<p>Sunday, November 7, 2021</p>



<p>Having gone west to <a href="https://altmode.org/2021/11/27/sussex-day-3-chichester-and-fishbourne/">Chichester</a> yesterday, today we went east to Hastings, notable for the Norman conquest of 1066 (although the actual Battle of Hastings was some distance inland). We arranged to meet Celeste on the train as we passed through Falmer, where her campus is located, for the hour-or-so trip along the coast. Unfortunately, it seems like it’s an hour train ride to most sights outside Brighton.</p>



<p>Hastings is an attractive and somewhat touristy town, along the Channel and in a narrow valley surrounded by substantial hills. We walked through the town, stopping for a fish and chips lunch along the way, and admiring the small shops in the Old Town. We took a funicular up one of the two hills and had an excellent view of the surrounding terrain. Unfortunately, the ruins of the castle at Hastings were closed for the season.<br><br></p>

<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2021/11/img_7741-1.jpg"></a>
Funicular and view from the top



<p>After returning via funicular, we continued through the town to the <a href="http://www.hmag.org.uk/">Hastings Museum</a>, a well curated (and free!) small museum that was thorough in its coverage of the history of the area, from the Iron Age to the present. It also included an extensive collection from a local family that sailed around the world in the 1800s.</p>



<p>Taking the train back, we had a change of trains in Lewes, which Celeste had visited and enjoyed previously. We stopped at the Lewes Arms pub, but unfortunately (since it was Sunday evening) the kitchen had closed so we couldn’t get food. So Celeste returned to campus and got dinner there, while Kenna and I got take-out chicken sandwiches to eat in our hotel.</p>



<p>Our weekly family Zoom conference is on Sunday evening, England time, so we ate our sandwiches while chatting with other family members back home. It’s so much easier to stay in close touch with family while traveling than it was just a few years ago.</p>

<p>I’ve spent quite a few hours evenings and weekends recently building out a
comprehensive suite of <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/sqitch/actions">GitHub Actions for Sqitch</a>. They cover a dozen versions
of Perl, nearly 70 database versions amongst nine database engines, plus a
coverage test and a release workflow. A pull request can expect over 100 actions
to run. Each build requires over 100 direct dependencies, plus all their
dependencies. Installing them for every build would make any given run
untenable.</p>
<p>Happily, GitHub Actions include a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/advanced-guides/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows" title="GitHub Actions: “Caching dependencies to speed up workflows”">caching feature</a>, and thanks to a
<a href="https://github.com/shogo82148/actions-setup-perl/pull/892">recent improvement to shogo82148/actions-setup-perl</a>,
it’s quite easy to use in a version-independent way. Here’s an example:</p>
  <code>name: Test
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  OS:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ ubuntu, macos, windows ]
        perl: [ 'latest', '5.34', '5.32', '5.30', '5.28' ]
    name: Perl ${{ matrix.perl }} on ${{ matrix.os }}
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Source
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Setup Perl
        id: perl
        uses: shogo82148/actions-setup-perl@v1
        with: { perl-version: "${{ matrix.perl }}" }
      - name: Cache CPAN Modules
        uses: actions/cache@v2
        with:
          path: local
          key: perl-${{ steps.perl.outputs.perl-hash }}
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: cpm install --verbose --show-build-log-on-failure --no-test --cpanfile cpanfile
      - name: Run Tests
        env: { PERL5LIB: "${{ github.workspace }}/local/lib/perl5" }
        run: prove -lrj4
</code>  <p>This workflow tests every permutation of OS and Perl version specified in
<code>jobs.OS.strategy.matrix</code>, resulting in 15 jobs. The <code>runs-on</code> value determines
the OS, while the <code>steps</code> section defines steps for each permutation. Let’s take
each step in turn:</p>
 
 “Checkout Source” checks the project out of GitHub. Pretty much required for
any project. 
 “Setup Perl” sets up the version of Perl using the value from the matrix.
Note the <code>id</code> key set to <code>perl</code>, used in the next step. 
 “Cache CPAN Modules” uses the <a href="https://github.com/actions/cache">cache action</a> to cache the directory named
<code>local</code> with the key <code>perl-${{ steps.perl.outputs.perl-hash }}</code>. The key
lets us keep different versions of the <code>local</code> directory based on a unique
key. Here we’ve used the <code>perl-hash</code> output from the <code>perl</code> step defined
above. The <code>actions-setup-perl</code> action outputs this value, which contains a
hash of the output of <code>perl -V</code>, so we’re tying the cache to a very specific
version and build of Perl. This is important since compiled modules are not
compatible across major versions of Perl. 
 “Install Dependencies” uses <a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/App-cpm/view/script/cpm" title="cpm - a fast CPAN module installer"><code>cpm</code></a> to quickly install Perl dependencies. By
default, it puts them into the <code>local</code> subdirectory of the current directory
— just where we configured the cache. On the first run for a given OS and
Perl version, it will install all the dependencies. But on subsequent runs
it will find the dependencies already present, thank to the cache, and
quickly exit, reporting “All requirements are satisfied.” In <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/sqitch/runs/4275487924?check_suite_focus=true">this Sqitch
job</a>, it takes less than a second. 
 “Run Tests” runs the tests that require the dependencies. It requires the
<code>PERL5LIB</code> environment variable to point to the location of our cached
dependencies. 
 
<p>That’s the whole deal. The first run will be the slowest, depending on the
number of dependencies, but subsequent runs will be much faster, up to the
seven-day caching period. For a complex project like Sqitch, which uses the same
OS and Perl version for most of its actions, this results in a tremendous build
time savings. CI configurations we’ve used in the past often took an hour or
more to run. Today, most builds take only a few minutes to test, with longer
times determined not by dependency installation but by container and database
latency.</p>

<p>Saturday, November 6, 2021</p>



<p>After a pleasant breakfast at a cafe in The Lanes, we met up with Celeste at the Brighton train station and rode to Chichester, about an hour to the west. Chichester is a pleasant (and yes, touristy) town with a notable cathedral. Arriving somewhat late, we walked through the town and then found lunch at a small restaurant on a side road as many of the major restaurants in town were quite crowded (it is a Saturday, after all).<br><br><br><br></p>



  
<p>One of the main attractions in the area is the <a href="https://sussexpast.co.uk/attraction/fishbourne-roman-palace-gardens/">Fishbourne Roman Palace</a>, one village to the west. We set out on foot, through a bit of rain, for a walk of a couple of miles. But when we arrived it was well worth the trip. This is an actual Roman palace, constructed in about 79AD, that had been uncovered starting in the 1960s, along with many coins, implements, and other artifacts. The mosaic floors were large and particularly impressive. As a teenager, I got to visit the ruins in Pompeii; these were of a similar nature. This palace and surrounding settlements were key to the Roman development of infrastructure in England.</p>
  



  
<p>Returning from Fishbourne to Chichester, we made a short visit to <a href="https://www.chichestercathedral.org.uk/">Chichester Cathedral</a>. Unfortunately, the sun had set and it was difficult to see most of the stained glass. At the time of our visit, there was a <a href="https://www.chichestercathedral.org.uk/news/50000-people-visited-luke-jerrams-museum-moon-chichester-cathedral">large model of the Moon</a>, traveling to several locations in Europe, that was hanging from the ceiling in the middle of the church. It was a striking thing to see, especially as we first entered.</p>

<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2021/11/img_7719-2.jpeg"></a>

  



<p>After our train trip back from Chichester, we parted with Celeste who returned to campus. Since it was a Saturday night, restaurants were crowded, but we were able to get dinner at a large chain pub, <a href="https://www.jdwetherspoon.com/pubs/all-pubs/england/east-sussex/the-post--telegraph-brighton">Wetherspoons</a>. The pub was noisy and table service was minimal. We ordered via their website and they only cleared the previous patrons’ dirty dishes when they delivered our food. The food was acceptable, but nothing to blog about.</p>

<p>A Reader’s&nbsp;Guide</p><p>How should crypto be regulated? And by whom? These are the big questions the industry is grappling with in the wake of the infrastructure bill being signed with the haphazardly expanded definition of a broker dealer for tax reporting provisions. So now the industry is *atwitter* with ideas about where to go from&nbsp;here.</p><p>Three large companies have all come out with policy suggestions: FTX, Coinbase and and A16z. While these proposals differ in approach, they all seek to address a few central policy questions. I’ll break down the proposals based on key subject&nbsp;areas:</p><p>Consumer Protection</p><p>A16: Suggests a framework for DAO’s to provide disclosures.</p><p>Coinbase: Sets a goal to “​​Enhance transparency through appropriate disclosure requirements. Protect against fraud and market manipulation”</p><p>FTX: Similarly suggests framework for “disclosure and transparency standards”</p><p>All three of these make ample mention of consumer protections that seem to begin and end at disclosures. Regulators might want something with a little more teeth. FTX provides a more robust outline for combating fraud, suggesting the use of on-chain analytics tools. This is a smart and concrete suggestion of how to improve existing regulation that relies on SARS reports filed AFTER suspicious activity.</p><p>Exactly how Decentralized?</p><p>A16: Seeks to create a definition and entity status for DAO’s, which would ostensibly require a different kind of regulation than more custodial services.</p><p>Coinbase: ​Platforms and services that do not custody or otherwise control the assets of a customer — including miners, stakers and developers — would need to be treated differently</p><p>FTX- Doesn’t mention decentralization.</p><p>These are really varied approaches. I’m not criticizing FTX here, they are focusing on consumer protections and combating fraud which are good things to highlight. However the core regulatory issues is- can we differentiate between decentralized and centralized products and does that create a fundamentally conflict with existing law. A16z’s approach is novel, a new designation without a new&nbsp;agency.</p><p>The Devil You Know vs The Devil you&nbsp;Don’t</p><p>A16- Suggests the Government Office of Accountability “assess the current state of regulatory jurisdiction over cryptocurrency, digital assets, and decentralized technology, and to compare the costs and benefits of harmonizing jurisdiction among agencies against vesting supervision and oversight with a federally chartered self-regulatory organization or one or more nonprofit corporations.”</p><p>Coinbase- Argues that this technology needs a new regulatory agency and that all digital assets should be under a single regulatory authority. Also suggests coordination with a Self Regulatory Organization.</p><p>FTX- Doesn’t step into that&nbsp;morass.</p><p>Coinbase has the most aggressive position here. I personally am not convinced of the need for a new regulatory agency. We haven’t tried it the old fashioned way yet, where existing agencies offer clarity about what would bring a digital asset into their jurisdiction and what would exclude it. Creating a new agency is a slow and expensive process. And then that agency would need to justify its existence by aggressively cracking down. It’s a bit like creating a hammer and then inevitably complaining that it sees everything as a&nbsp;nail.</p><p>How to achieve regulatory change in the US for&nbsp;crypto:</p>  Stop tweeting aggressively at the people who regulate you. Negative points if you are a billionaire complaining about&nbsp;taxes.  Spend some time developing relationships with policymakers and working collaboratively with communities you want to support. Lotta talk of unbanked communities- any stats on how they are being served by this tech? (Seriously please&nbsp;share)  Consider looking at who is already doing the work you want to accelerate and consider working with them/learning from and supporting existing efforts rather than whipping out your proposal and demanding attention. Examples: CoinCenter, Blockchain Association. At the state level: <a href="https://www.blockadvocacy.org/">Blockchain Advocacy Coalition </a>of course, Cascadia Blockchain Council, Texas Blockchain Council&nbsp;etc.  <p>A16: <a href="https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/2021-09-27-andreessen-horowitz-senate-banking-proposals/ec055eb0ce534033/full.pdf#page=9">https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/2021-09-27-andreessen-horowitz-senate-banking-proposals/ec055eb0ce534033/full.pdf#page=9</a></p><p>Coinbase: <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/digital-asset-policy-proposal-safeguarding-americas-financial-leadership-ce569c27d86">https://blog.coinbase.com/digital-asset-policy-proposal-safeguarding-americas-financial-leadership-ce569c27d86</a>c</p><p>FTX: <a href="https://blog.ftx.com/policy/policy-goals-market-regulation/">https://blog.ftx.com/policy/policy-goals-market-regulation/</a></p>

<p>I just read a <a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/on-the-horizon-ftcs-slaughter-maps-data-regulations-potential-future">wonderful piece</a> from Joseph Duball,<a>1</a> who reported on the U.S. Federal Trade Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter’s keynote at the IAPP’s “Privacy. Security. Risk 2021” event. According to Duball, Slaughter suggests that we need to change “the way people view, prioritize, and conceptualize their data.”</p>
<p>“Too many services are about leveraging consumer data instead of straightforwardly providing value. For even the savviest users, the price of browsing the internet is being tracked across the web.” – Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, Commissioner, U.S. Federal Trade Commission 2021<a>2</a></p>
<p>According to Slaughter, privacy issues within data-driven markets stem from surveillance capitalism, which is fueled by indiscriminate data collection practices. She suggests that the remedy to curtail these practices is to focus on “purpose and use” restrictions and limitations rather than solely relying on the notice &amp; choice framework. In other words, in the future industry may no longer justify data practice with explanations like “they opted in” and “we got consent” or falling ba</p>
<p>“Collection and use limitations can help protect people’s rights. It should not be necessary to trade one’s data away as a cost of full participation in society and the modern information economy.” – Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, Commissioner, U.S. Federal Trade Commission 2021<a>3</a></p>
 FTC Has Concerns Other Than Privacy 
<p>So that there is no uncertainty or doubt, however, Duball<a>4</a> reports that, while consumer privacy is a chief concern for the commission, it is not the primary concern to the exclusion of other concerns. The commission is also worried about algorithmic bias and “dark patterns” practices. In other words, it is not just about the data, it is about the methods used to “trick” people into giving it up and how it is processed and applied to business decision-making.</p>
 Takeaway 
<p>My takeaway is that it is time for organizations to take a serious look at revamping their end-to-end processes and tech-stacks. This is a c-suite leadership all-hands-on-deck moment. It will take years for the larger organizations to turn their flotilla in the right direction, and for the industry at large to sort everything out. However, rest asserted, the empowered person–the self-sovereign individual–is nigh and will sort it out for industry soon enough.</p>
<p>There is time, but not much, maybe three, five, or seven years, before the people will be equipped with the knowledge and tools to take back control of their data. It is already happening; just look at open banking in the UK. These new tools, aka personal information management systems, will enable people to granularly exchange data on their terms with their stated purpose of use, not the businesses. They will give them the power to process data in a way that protects them from bias or at least helps them know when it is happening.</p>
<p>Why should businesses care about all this? Well, I predict, as do many so I’m not too far out on a limb here, that in the not-too-distant future, the empowered, connected individual will walk with their wallet and only do business with those institutions that respect their sovereignty, both physically and digitally. So, to all out there, it is time, and it is time to prepare for the future.</p>

<p>No civilisation can exist or prosper without the rule of law. The rule of law cannot exist without a proper justice system. In India, criminals have a free reign as justice system is used as a tool to make victims succumb into unfair settlements or withdrawals. Unfortunately, the Indian justice system has gone caput and remains clogged with over 4+ crore cases pending in courts due to following core&nbsp;reasons.</p> Policy gap 1 — Only in India there is zero deterrence to&nbsp;perjury <p>a. In India, perjury law is taken very lightly. 99% of cases are full of lies, deceit and mockery of justice. Affidavits in India do not serve much purpose. There have been various judgments and cries from all levels of judiciary but in&nbsp;vain.</p><p>b. Perjury makes any case 10x more complex and consumes 20x more time to adjudicate. It is akin to allowing a bullock cart in the middle of express highway. It is nothing but an attack on justice delivery system. Historically, perjury used to be punished with death sentence and considered an equally serious crime as&nbsp;murder.</p><p>c. This is against the best international practices and does not make economic sense for&nbsp;India.</p> Policy gap 2 — India has no equivalent laws such as the U.S. Federal Rule 11 enacted in 1983 (as amendment in 1993) to curb the explosion of frivolous litigation. <p>The entire provision of rule 11 of U.S. federal rules can be summarized in the following manner:</p><p>It requires that a district court mandatorily sanction attorneys or parties who submit improper pleadings like pleadings with</p>  Improper purpose  Containing frivolous arguments  Facts or arguments that have no evidentiary support  Omissions and errors, misleading and crafty&nbsp;language  Baseless or unreasonable denials with non-application of&nbsp;mind  Negligence, failure to appear or unreasonable adjournments  <p>All developed countries like UK and Australia also have similar laws to combat frivolous litigation.</p> Police gap 3 — Only in India the lawyers are barred from contingent fee agreements under Bar council&nbsp;rules   Indian lawyers are incentivized to make cases go longer, add complexity and never end. Consequently, they super specialize and become innovators in creating alibis so that the case never&nbsp;ends.  Lawyers in India do not investigate or legally vet the case before&nbsp;filing.  There is no incentive to apply for torts claims or prosecute perjury and therefore there is no deterrence created.  Lawyers are supposed to be gate keepers to prevent frivolous litigation but in India it is actually opposite due to the perverse policy on contingent fee and&nbsp;torts.  <p>Economic modelling suggests that — contingent fee arrangements reduce frivolous suits when compared to hourly fee arrangements. The reasoning is simple: When an attorney’s compensation is based solely on success, as opposed to hours billed, there is great incentive to accept and prosecute only meritorious cases.</p><p>At least one empirical analysis concludes that — “hourly fees encourage the filing of low-quality suits and increase the time to settlement (i.e., contingency fees increase legal quality and decrease the time to settlement).”</p> Negative impact of the 3 policy&nbsp;gaps <p>1. Conviction rates in India are abysmally low below 10% whereas internationally between 60% — 100%.<a>[1]</a></p><blockquote>a. Japan — 99.97%</blockquote><blockquote>b. China — 98%</blockquote><blockquote>c. Russia — 90%</blockquote><blockquote>d. UK — 80%</blockquote><blockquote>e. US — between 65% and&nbsp;80%</blockquote><p>2. Globally the 80%-99% cases get settled before trial but India its actually opposite&nbsp;because</p>  There is absolutely no fear of law and perjury is a&nbsp;norm.  Lawyers have no interest in driving a settlement due to per appearance fee&nbsp;system.  There is an artificial limit of fee shifting (awarding costs), torts and there is no motivation of the part of judges to create deterrence.  <p>3. The contingent fee and tort cannot be enabled till such time the fraternity of lawyers can be relied upon for ethical and moral&nbsp;conduct.</p><p>— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —&nbsp;—</p><blockquote>Easy solution to complex&nbsp;problem</blockquote><p>— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —&nbsp;—</p> Policy 1 — Restricting perjury and making it a non-bailable offence will resolve 50% cases immediately <br>(i.e. 1.5 crore cases within 3&nbsp;months) <p>India must truly embrace “Satyam ev jayate” and make perjury a non-bailable offence. All lawyers and litigants should be given 3 month’s notice to refile their pleadings or settle the cases. They would have to face the mandatory consequences of false evidence or averments later found to be&nbsp;untrue.</p><p>There needs to be a basic expectation reset in Indian courts litigation — the filings are correct, and the lawyer is responsible for prima facie diligence and candor before courts. The role of judiciary is not to distinguish between truth and false but to determine the sequence of events, fix accountability and award penalties. Presenting false evidence or frivolous arguments must be seen as separate offence on its&nbsp;own.</p><blockquote>At a minimum IPC 195(1)(b)(i) must be removed that states the following –</blockquote><blockquote>“No Court shall take cognizance- of any offence punishable under any of the following sections of the IPC (45 of 1860), namely, sections 193 to 196 (both inclusive), 199, 200, 205 to 211 (both inclusive) and 228, when such offence is alleged to have been committed in, or in relation to, any proceeding in any&nbsp;Court”</blockquote><p>Because:</p>  This necessarily makes the judges party to the complaint and therefore all judges are reluctant to prosecute perjury.  This estoppel opens up possibility of corruption in judiciary and public&nbsp;offices.  The intention of this provision has clearly backfired. This restriction is unique to india and against the international norms   Policy 2 — Sanctions on lawyers to streamline the perverse incentives that plague Indian justice&nbsp;system <p>The courts in USA are mandated to compulsorily sanction lawyers for various professional misconduct in litigation (Federal rule 11 of civil procedure) like:</p><p>Remedies and sanctions for lawyer’s misconduct can be categorized into three&nbsp;groups.</p>  Sanctions and remedies for attorney misconduct which are available to public authorities. Such sanctions include professional discipline, criminal liability of lawyers who assist their clients in committing criminal acts, and judicially imposed sanctions such as for contempt of court. Professional discipline is generally the best known sanction for attorney misconduct.  Sanctions which are available to lawyers’ clients. For example, damages for attorney malpractice, forfeiture of an attorney’s fee, and judicial nullification of gifts or business transactions that breach a lawyer’s fiduciary duty to a&nbsp;client.  Remedies that may be available to third parties injured by a lawyer’s conduct on behalf of a client. These include injunctions against representing a client in violation of the lawyer’s duty to a third party, damages for breach of an obligation the attorney assumes to a non-client, and judicial nullification of settlements or jury verdicts obtained by attorney misconduct.   Policy 3 — Contingent Fee and Tort Law making judiciary 3x efficient. <blockquote>(needs perjury law as discussed above to&nbsp;unlock)</blockquote><p>In India Lawyers spend more time in making the case complex and lengthy based on “dehari system” while the western counterparts earn far more money by genuinely solving cases and creating real values for the country. The market economics based on judicial policy on regulating legal profession and ethics in India is however geared towards permanently clogging the system. 3 of the 4 stakeholders benefit by making the litigation never&nbsp;end.</p><p>There is a dire need for the system to be re-incentivized wherein the legal profession can generate 10x more value for the country in catching and penalizing law abusers. This in turn will also attract and create more talented lawyers because then they will be investing more time in investigating and preparing the cases to&nbsp;win.</p><p>Making perjury a non-bailable offence and rules for mandatorily sanctioning lawyer mis-conduct will unlock the contingent fee and tort law in&nbsp;India.</p><p>Allowing contingent fee for lawyers have four principal policy justifications</p><p>Firstly, such arrangements</p>  enable the impecunious (having no money) to obtain representation. Such persons cannot afford the costs of litigation unless and until it is successful. Even members of the middle- and upper-socioeconomic classes may find it difficult to pay legal fees in advance of success and collection of judgment.  This is particularly so today as litigation has become more complex, often involving suits against multiple parties or multinational entities, and concerning matters requiring expert scientific and economic evidence.  <p>Secondly,</p>  Contingent fee arrangements can help align the interests of lawyer and client, as both will have a direct financial stake in the outcome of the litigation.  <p>Third</p>  By predicating an attorney’s compensation on the success of a suit, the attorney is given incentive to function as gatekeeper, screening cases for both merit and sufficiency of proof, and lodging only those likely to&nbsp;succeed.  This provides as an important and genuine signal for litigants to understand the merit of their&nbsp;case.  <p>Fourth</p>  And more generally, all persons of sound mind should be permitted to contract freely, and restrictions on contingent fee arrangements inhibit this&nbsp;freedom.  <p>Three other reasons to justify unlocking of contingent fee:-</p>  Clients, particularly unsophisticated ones, may be unable to determine when an attorney has underperformed or acted irresponsibly;15 in these instances, an attorney’s reputation would be unaffected, and thus the risk of reputational harm would not adequately protect against malfeasance.  Even when clients are aware of an attorney’s poor performance or irresponsibility, they may lack the means, media, or credibility to effectively harm the attorney’s reputation.  The interests of attorney and client are more closely aligned, ceteris paribus, when fee arrangements are structured so as to minimize perverse incentives.   Why contingent fees reduce caseload: <p>Lesser cases better&nbsp;filing</p><p>Complainants get genuine advice about chances of winning. They do not file unless they get lawyer’s&nbsp;buy-in.</p>  Lawyers screen cases for merit and sufficiency of proof before&nbsp;filing.  Lawyers don’t pick up bad cases to manage reputation.  Comprehensive evidence gathering happens before Lawyer decides to file a&nbsp;case.  <p>Lawyers simplify case and only allege charges that can be sustained.</p>  Use simple and concise arguments for the&nbsp;judges.  Lawyers spend more time working hard outside the courts. Thus increasing case&nbsp;quality.  <p>Faster case proceedings</p>  Less adjournments and&nbsp;hearings  They do better preparation and take less adjournments.  Multiple steps get completed in single hearings.  They create urgency for clients to show up at every&nbsp;hearing.  Lawyers do not unnecessarily appeal and stay matters because they do not get paid per hearing and want quick&nbsp;results.  <p>Case withdrawals</p>  There are less takers if a lawyer drops a case when there are surprises by client which will adversely impact the&nbsp;outcome.  Lawyers persuade complainants to settle when appropriate.   Conclusions <p>With 3+ crore cases pending and a dysfunctional justice delivery there is a mass exodus of Ultra High Net worth Individuals (UHNIs) from India. There is an absolute urgent need for above reforms before the situation turns into a complete banana republic.</p><p>It is an absolute embarrassment and national shame to allow Indians to be blatant liars even in courts. Business and survival in India today is a race to the bottom just because there is no bar on falsehood and having corrupt values, it is near impossible to survive without being part of the same&nbsp;culture.</p><p>It is prayed that even more stricter laws be enacted than just global norms such that Indians can be trusted globally to never lie. It’s not just about Indian courts but they could be counted as the most truthful race even in foreign lands and command high respect globally.</p> Restoring justice&nbsp;delivery  Economic benefits of reform in perjury, contingent fee and legal&nbsp;ethics <p>1. Higher quality of litigation work.</p><p>2. Attract better talent to the profession due to higher profitability.</p><p>3. Create more jobs in the&nbsp;economy.</p><p>4. Offer higher pool of qualified people for judiciary.</p><p>5. Drastic reduction in corrupt or criminal activity due to fear of&nbsp;law.</p><p>6. Unlocking of trillions of dollars of wealth/resources stuck in litigation.</p><p>7. Better investment climate due to more reliability in business transactions.</p><p>8. Higher reliability in products and services.</p><p>9. Access to justice for&nbsp;all.</p><p>10.

     <p>In the week where the worlds “leaders” meet to discuss and agree on the future of our climate at&nbsp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_United_Nations_Climate_Change_Conference">#COP26</a>, I remain sceptical about agreements.&nbsp; At <a href="https://newsroom.unfccc.int/news/forest-leaders-to-cop22-climate-conference-the-forest-transformation-is-happening-now">#COP22 there was an agreement to halve deforestation by 2020</a>; we missed it, so we have moved the target out. &nbsp; Here is a <a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/conferences/past-conferences/past-conferences-overview">review of all the past COP meetings and outcomes.</a> It is hard to find any resources to compare previous agreements with achievements.&nbsp; Below is from the UN.&nbsp;</p><br><p><a href="https://unfccc.int/topics/science/workstreams/periodic-review#eq-1"></a></p><br><p>The reason I remain doubtful and sceptical is that the decision of 1.5 degrees is framed.&nbsp; We are optimising for a goal.&nbsp; In this case, we do not want to increase our global temperature beyond 1.5 degrees.&nbsp; Have you ever tried to heat water and stop the heating process such that a temperature target was reached. Critically you only have one go.&nbsp; &nbsp; Try it. Fill a pan with ice and set a target, say 38.4 degrees, use a thermometer and switch off the pan when you think the final temperature will be your target. Did you manage to get within 1.5 degrees of your target?&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/">Peak Paradox framework</a> forces us to think that we cannot optimise for one outcome, one goal, one target or for a one-dimensional framing. To do so would be to ignore other optimisations, visions, ideas or beliefs.&nbsp; When we optimise, for one thing, something else will not have an optimal outcome.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In business, we are asked to articulate a single purpose, one mission, the single justification that sets out a reason to exist.&nbsp; The more we as a board or senior leadership team optimise for “performance”, the more we become directional. Performance itself, along with the thinking that drives the best allocation of resources, means we are framed to optimise for an outcome. &nbsp; In social sciences and economics, this is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_dependence">path dependency</a>. &nbsp; The unintended consequences of our previous decisions that drive efficiency and effectiveness might not directly impact us, but another part of an interdependent system that, through several unconnected actions, will feed into our future decisions and outcomes.&nbsp; Complex system thinking highlights such causes and effects of positive and negative feedback loops.&nbsp;</p><p>By example. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dishwasher_detergent">Dishwasher tablets</a> make me more productive but make the water system less efficient by reducing the effectiveness of the <a href="https://www.ethicalconsumer.org/home-garden/shopping-guide/ethical-dishwasher-detergent">ecosystem</a>. However, I am framed by performance and my own efficiency; therefore, I have to optimise my time, and the dishwasher is a perfect solution.&nbsp; Indeed we are marketed that the dishwasher saves water and energy compared to other washing up techniques. The single narrow view of optimisation is straightforward and easy to understand.&nbsp; The views we hold on battery cars to mobile phones is framed as one of being more productive.&nbsp; Performance as a metric matters more than anything else, why because the story says performance creates economic activity that creates growth that means fewer people are in poverty.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“Performance” is a one-dimensional optimisation where economic activity based on financial outcomes wins.&nbsp; You and I are the agents of any increase in performance, and the losses in the equation of equilibrium are somewhere else in the system. We are framed and educated to doubt the long, complex link between the use of anti-bacterial wipes and someone else’s skin condition. Performance as a dimension for measurement creates an optimal outcome for one and a sub-optimal outcome for someone else.&nbsp;</p><p>Performance as a measure creates an optimal outcome for one and a sub-optimal outcome for someone else.&nbsp;</p><p>If it was just me, then the cause and effect relationship are hard to see, but when more of humanity optimises for performance, it is the scale at which we all lose that suddenly comes into effect. Perhaps it is time to question the simple linear ideas of one purpose, one measure, one mission, and try to optimise for different things simultaneously; however, that means simple political messages, tabloid headlines, and social-media-driven advertising will fail.&nbsp; Are leaders ready to lead, or do they enjoy too much power to do the right thing?</p> <br>

<p>Art- A call for New Industry Data Exchange Models, The Trust Chain, and A Connected Individual Transaction And Identity Scoring Scheme: An Interview with Virginie Debris of GMS</p>
<p>I recently sat down with Virginie Debris, the Chief Product Officer for <a href="https://www.gms-worldwide.com/">Global Messaging Service</a> (GMS) and Board Member of the <a href="https://mobileecosystemforum.com/about/global-board/">Mobile Ecosystem Forum</a>, to talk about personal data and identity (PD&amp;I). We had an enlightening discussion (<a href="https://youtu.be/ftJ_4800W2Y">see video of the interview: 46:16 min)</a>). The conversation took us down unexpected paths and brought several insights and recommendations to light.</p>
<p>In our interview, we discussed the role of personal data and identity and how enterprises use it to know and serve their customers and protect the enterprises’ interests. To my delight, we uncovered three ideas that could help us all better protect PD&amp;I and improve the market’s efficiency.</p>
 
 Idea One: Build out and refine “The Trust Chain”, or “chain of trust,” a PD&amp;I industry value chain framework envisioned by Virginie. 
 Idea Two: Refine PD&amp;I industry practices, optimize all of the data that mobile operators are holding on to, and ensure that appropriate technical, legal, and ethical exchange mechanisms are in place to ensure responsible use of PD&amp;I. 
 Idea Three: Standardize a connected individual identity scoring scheme, i.e., a scheme for identity and transaction verification, often centralized around mobile data. This scheme is analogous to credit scoring for lending and fraud detection for credit card purchases. It would help enterprises simultaneously better serve their customers, protect PD&amp;I, mitigate fraud, and improve their regulatory compliance efforts. 
 
<p>According to Virginie, a commercial imperative for an enterprise is knowing their customer–verifying the customer’s identity prior to and during engagements. Knowing the customer helps enterprises not only better serve the customer, but also manage costs, reduce waste, mitigate fraud, and stay on the right side of the law and regulations. Virginie remarked that her customers often say, “I want to know who is my end user. Who am I talking to? Am I speaking to the right person in front of me?” This is hard enough in the physical realm, and in the digital realm it is even more difficult. The ideas discussed in this interview can help enterprises answer these questions.</p>
 Consumer Identity and the Enterprise 
<p>The mobile phone has become a cornerstone for digital identity management and commerce. In fact, Cameron D’Ambrosi, Managing Director of Liminal, has gone as far as to suggest <a>mobile has an irreplaceable role in the digital identity ecosystem</a>.<a>1</a> Mobile can help enterprises be certain whom they are dealing with, and with this certainty help them, with confidence, successfully connect, communicate, and engage people in nearly any transactions.</p>
<p>To successfully leverage mobile as a tool for customer identity management, which is an enabler of what is known as “know your customer” or KYC, enterprises work with organizations like GMS to integrate mobile identity verification into their commercial workflow. In our interview, Virginie notes that GMS is a global messaging aggregator, the “man in the middle.” It provides messaging and related services powered by personal data and identity to enterprises and mobile operators, including KYC services.</p>
 Benefits gained from knowing your customer 
<p>There is a wide range of use cases for why an enterprise may want to use services provided by players like GMS. They can:</p>
 
 Improve customer experience: Knowing the customer and the context of a transaction can help improve the customer experience. 
 Maintain data hygiene: Ensuring data in a CRM or customer system of record that is accurate can improve marketing, save money, reduce fraud, and more. 
 Effectively manage data: Reducing duplicate records, tagging data, and more can reduce costs, create efficiency, and generate new business opportunities (side note: <a>poor data management costs enterprises billions annually</a>).<a>2</a> 
 Ensure regulatory compliance: Industry and government best practices, legislation, and regulation is not just nice to have; it is a business requirement. Staying compliant can mitigate risk, build trust, and help organizations differentiate themselves in the market. 
 Mitigate cybercrime: Cybercrime is costing industry trillions of dollars a year (<a>Morgan (2020) predicts the tally could be as much as $10.5 trillion annually by 2025</a>).<a>3</a>These losses can be reduced with an effective strategy. 
 
 The connected individual identity scoring scheme 
<p>When a consumer signs up for or buys a product or service, an enterprise may prompt them to provide a mobile number and other personal data as part of the maintenance of their profile and to support the transaction. An enterprise working with GSM, in real-time, can ping GMS’s network to verify if the consumer-provided mobile number is real, i.e., operational. Moreover, they can ask GMS to predict, with varying levels of accuracy, if a mobile number and PD&amp;I being used in a transaction is associated with a real person. They can also ask if the presumed person conducting the transaction can be trusted or if they might be a fraudster looking to cheat the business. This is a decision based on relevant personal information provided by the individual prior to or during the transaction, as well as data drawn from other sources.</p>
<p>This type of real-time identity and trust verification is made possible by a process Virginie refers to as “scoring.” I refer to it as “the connected individual identity scoring scheme.” Scoring is an intricate and complex choreography of data management and analysis, executed by GMS in milliseconds. This dance consists of pulling together and analyzing a myriad of personal data, deterministic and probabilistic identifiers, and mobile phone signals. The actors in this dance include GMS, the enterprise, the consumer, and GMS’s strategic network of mobile network operators and PD&amp;I aggregator partners.</p>
<p>When asked by an enterprise to produce a score, GMS, in real-time, combines and analyzes enterprise-provided data (e.g., customer name, addresses, phone number, presumed location, etc.), mobile operator signal data (e.g., the actual location of a phone, SIM card, and number forwarding status), and PD&amp;I aggregator supplied data. From this information, it produces a score. This score is used to determine the likelihood a transaction being initiated by “someone” is legitimate and can be trusted, or not. A perfect score of 1 would suggest that, with one hundred percent certainty, the person is who they say they are and can be trusted, and a score of zero would suggest they are most certainly a cybercriminal.</p>
<p>In our interview, Virginie notes, “nothing is perfect, we need to admit that,” thus suggesting that one should never expect a perfect score. The more certain a business wants to be, i.e.&nbsp;the higher score they require to confirm a transaction, the more the business should expect the possibility of increased transactional costs, time, and friction in the user experience. Keeping this in mind, businesses should develop a risk tolerance matrix, based on the context of a transaction, to determine if they want to accept the current transaction or not. For example, for lower risk or lower cost transactions (e.g., an online pizza order) the business might have a lower assurance tolerance and will accept a lower score. For higher-risk or higher-cost transactions (e.g., a bank wire transfer), they might need a higher assurance tolerance and accept only higher scores.</p>
 Example: Detecting fraud in a banking experience 
<p>Virginie used a bank transaction as an example. She explained that a bank could check if a customer’s mobile phone is near the expected location of a transaction. If it was not, this might suggest there is a possibility of fraud occurring, which would negatively impact the score.</p>
<p>Mobile scoring happens every day, but not always by this name–others refer to it as mobile signaling or mobile device intelligence. However, Virginie alluded to a challenge. There is no industry standard for scoring, which may lead to inconsistencies in execution and bias across the industry. She suggested that more industry collaboration is needed to prevent this.</p>
 The Trust Chain 
<p>During our conversation, Virginie proposed a novel idea which frames what we in the industry could do to optimize the PD&amp;I value and use it responsibly. Virginie said we need to build a chain of trust amongst the PD&amp;I actors, “The Trust Chain”.</p>
<p>I have taken poetic license, based on our conversation, and have illustrated The Trust Chain in the figure below. The figure depicts connected individuals* at the center, resting on a bed of industry players linked to enterprises. A yellow band circles them all to illustrate the flow of personal data and identity throughout the chain.</p>
<p></p>
 
 Defining the connected individual and being phygital: It is so easy in business to get distracted by our labels. It is important to remember the terms we use to refer to the people we serve—prospect, consumer, patient, shopper, investor, user, etc.—are contrived and can distract. These terms are all referring to the same thing: a human, an individual, and more importantly, a contextual state or action at some point along the customer journey, i.e., sometimes I am a shopper considering a product, other times I am a consumer using the product. The shopper and the consumer are not always the same person. Understanding this is important to ensure effective engagement in the connected age. In the context of today’s world and this discussion, the individual is connected. They are connected with phones, tablets, smartwatches, cars, and more. These connections have made us “phygital” beings, merging the digital and physical self. Each and every one of these connections is producing data. 
 
<p>According to Virginie, the key to making the industry more effective and efficient is to tap into more and more of the connected individual data held and managed by mobile network operators. This is because, in her own words, “they know everything.” To tap into this data, Virginie said a number of technical, legal, and ethical complexities must be overcome. In addition, an improved model for data exchange amongst the primary actors of the industry—mobile network operators, enterprises, messaging aggregators (like GMS), and PD&amp;I aggregators—needs to be established. In other words, “The Trust Chain” needs to be refined and built. The presumption behind all of this is that the current models of data exchange can be found wanting.</p>
 What we need to do next 
<p>In summary, the conclusion I draw from my interview with Virginie are that we should come together to tackle:</p>
 
 The technical, legal, and ethical complexities to enable more effective access to the treasure trove of data held by the mobile network operators 
 The standardization of a connected individual scoring scheme 
 The development and integrity for “The Trust Chain” 
 
<p>My takeaway from our discussion is simple, I agree with her ideas. These efforts and more are needed. The use of personal data and identity throughout the industry is accelerating at an exponential rate. To ensure all parties can safely engage, transact, and thrive, it is critical that industry leaders develop a sustainable and responsible, marketplace.</p>

<p>Prelude: First off, if you haven’t already read <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~fms27/papers/2012-BonneauHerOorSta-password--oakland.pdf">The Quest to Replace the Password</a> stop reading this and give that a read first. To paraphrase my computer security professor, If you haven’t read this paper before you design an authentication system you’re probably just reinventing something already created or missing a piece of the puzzle. So go ahead take a read of that paper first before you continue on. In fact, I just re-read this paper before I started working on it because it does an excellent job of framing the problem.</p>

 

<p>Over the past few years, I’ve spent a fair amount of time thinking about what the next generation of authentication and authorization systems will look like from a variety of different perspectives. I started out looking at the problem from a user’s perspective originally just looking to get rid of passwords. Then I looked at it as an attacker working as an intern penetration tester which gave me a unique eye into understanding the attacker mindset. Unfortunately, I didn’t find myself enjoying the red team side of security too much (combined with having a 2-year non-compete as an intern - that was a joke in hindsight) so by happenstance, I found myself into the standards community where the next generation of authentication (AuthN) and authorization (AuthZ) systems have been being built. Combine this with the view of a software engineer attempting to build the standards that are being written by some world-class experts with centuries of combined experience. Throughout this experience, I’ve gotten to view the state of the art while also getting to keep the naiveness that comes with being a fairly new engineer relative to some of the experts I get to work with. During this time I’ve become a bit more opinionated on what makes a good authentication system and this time around I’m going to jot down my current thoughts on what makes something useful.</p>

<p>However, one aspect that I think that paper lacks is that it frames the problem of authentication on the web as something where the next goal is to move to something different other than passwords, but we just haven’t found that better thing yet. While I think this is probably true for some aspects of low-security systems I think that fundamentally passwords or more generally, “Things I know” are here to stay. The problem is that we haven’t done a good enough job of understanding the requirements that the user needs to intuitively use the system as well as making sure that the system sufficiently gets out of the way of the user. As the paper does point out though, this is likely due to our specialization bias which doesn’t allow us to take into considerations the holistic view points necessary to approach the problem. What I’m proposing I think is a way in which we can jump this hurdle through the usage of hard data. Read on and let me know if you think this can solve this issue or if I’m just full of my own implicit biases.</p>

<p>So what’re the important insights that I’ve been thinking about lately? First off, the user experience of authenticating on the web has to be joyful first and foremost. If the user doesn’t have a better experience than what they do with passwords, which is a very low bar to beat when considering all the passwords they have to remember, then it’s simply unacceptable and won’t achieve the uptake that’s needed to overtake passwords.</p>

<p>Secondly, I think it’s important that we recognize that the security of any authentication system is probabilistic, not deterministic. By reframing the problem to understand that with each additional security check we do under the classifications of “what I know”, “what I am”, and “what I have” it allows us to better understand the problem we’re actually trying to solve with security. To put this idea in perspective think about the problem this way. What’s the probability that a security system will be broken for any particular user during a particular period? For example, a user who chooses to reuse their password that’s set to “#1password” for every website is a lot less likely (my intuition - happy to be proven wrong) than a user who can memorize a password like “p2D16U$nClNjqLseKTtnjw” for every website. However, there’s a significant tradeoff on the user’s experience which is why the case where a user reuses an easy to remember is a lot more likely to occur when studying users than the latter case even though we know it’s less secure.</p>

<p>So what gives? This all sounds obvious to a semi-well thought-out engineer, right? The difference is we simply don’t know the probability of a security system failing in an ideal scenario over a pre-determined period. To put this in perspective - can anyone point me to an academic research paper or even some user research that tells me the probability that a user’s password will be discovered by an attacker in the next year? What about the probability that the user shares their password with a trusted person because the system wasn’t deployed with a delegation system? Or how about how the probability will drop as the user reuses their password across many websites? Simply put I think we’ve been asking the wrong question here and until we can have hard data on this we can’t make rigorous choices on the acceptable UX/security tradeoffs that are so hard to decide today.</p>

<p>This isn’t relevant for just passwords either, this extends to many different forms of authentication that fall under the other two authentication classes as well. For example, what’s the probability that a user’s account will be breached when relying on the Open ID Connect protocol rather than a password? Furthermore, what’s the likelihood that the user prefers the Open ID Connect system rather than a password for each website, and is that likelihood worth the increase or decrease in probabilistic security under one or many attack vectors?</p>

<p>The best part of this framing is that it changes how we look at security on the web from the user’s perspective, but that’s not the only part that has to be considered as is rightly pointed in the paper. There’s a very important third factor that has to be considered as well which is deployability, which I like to reframe as “developer experience” or DevX.</p>

<p>By evaluating a constraint of a system in this way we reframe the problem into a measurable outcome that becomes far more tractable and measurable between the variety of constraints that need to be considered including the developer deploying or maintaining the system, the user who’s using it, and the resistance to common threats (Don’t worry about unrealistic threat models for now - mature them over time) which the user expects the designers of the system to protect them from.</p>

<p>Once we’ve got that data let’s sit down and re-evaluate what are the most important principles of designing the system. I’ll make a few predictions to wrap this up as well.</p>

<p>First prediction: I think once we have this data we’ll see a few different things which will be obvious in hindsight. A system that doesn’t prioritize UX over DevX over probabilistic security resilience will be dead in the water since it goes against the “user should enjoy the authentication experience principle”. Additionally, DevX has to come before security because without a good devX it’s less likely to be implemented at all let alone properly.</p>

<p>Second prediction: I’d venture to guess that we’ll learn a few things about the way we frame security on the web with the clear winner being that we should be designing for MFA systems by default, but “what I have” categories need to be the basis of the majority of experiences for the user with the “what I know” categories being an escalated approach with “what I am” categories only being needed in the highest assurance use cases or at the time of more red flags having been raised (e.g. new IP address, new device, etc) and being enforced on-device rather than handled by a remote server.</p>

<p>Final prediction: Recovery is going to be the hardest part of the system to figure out with multi-device flows being only slightly easier to solve. I wouldn’t be surprised if the solution to recovery was actually to not recover and instead make it super easy to “burn and recreate” (as John Jordan has advocated in the decentralized identity community) an account on the web because that’s how hard recovery actually is to get right.</p>

<p>So that’s what I’ve got for now. I’m sure I’m missing something here and I’m sure I’m wrong in a few other cases. Share your comments on this down below or feel free to send me an email and tell me I’m wrong. I do appreciate the thoughtfulness that others put into pointing these things out so let me know what you think and let’s discuss it further. Thanks for reading!</p>

    We spend most of our waking hours being held to account between the guardrails of risk-informed and responsible decision making.&nbsp; Undoubtedly, we often climb over the guardrails and make ill-informed, irresponsible and irrational decisions, but that is human agency. It is also true that we would not innovate, create or discover if we could not explore the other side of our safety guardrails.&nbsp; <p>Today’s perception of responsible decision making is different to that our grandparents held.&nbsp; Our grandchildren will look back at our “risk-informed” decisions with the advantage of hindsight and question why our risk management frameworks were so short-term-focused.&nbsp; However, we need to recognise that our guardrails are established by current political, economic and societal framing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>What are we optimising for?”</p><p>I often ask the question, “what are we optimising for?” The reason I ask this question is to draw out different viewpoints in a leadership team.&nbsp; The viewpoints that drive individual optimisation is framed by their experience, ability to understand time-frames and incentives.&nbsp;</p><p>Peak Paradox is a non-confrontational framework to explore our different perceptions of what we are optimising for.&nbsp; We need different and diverse views to ensure that our guardrails don’t become so narrow they look like rail tracks, and we repeat the same mistakes because that is what the process determines.&nbsp; Equally, we must agree together boundaries of divergence which means we can optimise as a team for something that we believe in and has a shared purpose of us and our stakeholders.&nbsp; Finding this dynamic area of alignment is made easier with the Peak Paradox framework.&nbsp;</p><p>However, our model of risk-informed responsible decision making is based on the idea that the majority decides, essentially democracy.&nbsp; If the “majority” is a supermajority, we need 76%; for a simple majority, we need 51%, and for minority protections less than 10%.&nbsp; What we get depends on how someone has previously set up the checks, balances, and control system. And then there is the idea of monarchy or the rich and powerful making the decisions for everyone else, the 0.001%.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>However, our guardrails for democratic decision making breaks down when there is a need for choices, decisions, judgement that has to be made that people do not like.&nbsp; How do we enable better decisions when hard decisions mean you will lose the support of the majority?&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>We do not all agree with vaccines (even before covid), eating meat, climate change, our government or authority.&nbsp; Vaccines in the current global pandemic period are one such tension of divergence.&nbsp; We see this every day in the news feeds; there is an equal and opposite view for every side.&nbsp; Humanity at large lives at Peak Paradox, but we don’t equally value everyone views. Why do we struggle with the idea that individual liberty of choice can be taken away in the interests of everyone?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Climate change is another.&nbsp; Should the government act in the longer term and protect the future or act in the short term persevering liberty and ensure re-election?&nbsp; Protestors with a cause may fight authority and are portrayed as mavericks and disruptors, but history remembers many as pioneers, martyrs and great leaders.&nbsp; Those who protested in the 1960 and 1970s against nuclear energy may look back today and think that they should have been fighting fossil fuels.&nbsp; Such pioneers are optimising for something outside of the normal guardrails. Whilst they appear to be living outside of the accepted guardrails, they can see they should be adopted.</p><p>Our guardrails work well when we can agree on the consequences of risk-informed and responsible decision making; however, in an age when information is untrusted and who is responsible is questioned, we find that we all have different guardrails.&nbsp; Living at Peak Paradox means we have to accept we will never agree on what is a responsible decision and we are likely to see that our iteration of democracy that maintains power and control is going to end in a revolution if we could only agree on what to optimise for.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>

    Are the consequence of a ½ baked decision that we created (the mess we are in)squared <br><p>This article joins how the #climate outcomes we get may be related to the evidence requirements we set.&nbsp; The audience for this viewpoint is those who are thinking about the long term consequences of our current decisions and the evidence we use to support those decisions. We are hoping to bring a sense of clarity to our community on why we feel frustrated and lost. You should read this because it will make you think and it will raise questions we need to debate over coffee as we search to become better versions of ourselves.&nbsp;</p><p>@yaelrozencwajg @yangbo @tonyfish </p><p>The running order is: Which camp are you in for positioning of the crisis: know and accepted, still questioning or denial. &nbsp; What are the early approaches to solutions?&nbsp; What are policymakers doing and what is their perspective.&nbsp; The action is to accept the invitation to debate at the end.</p><br><p>Part 1. Sustainability set up</p><p>The world appears more opinionated and divided about everything.&nbsp; Climate change: real or not.&nbsp; Vaccination for COVID19 conspiracy and control or in the public best interest.&nbsp; Space travel for billionaires or feeding those in need. Universal basic income policy vs ignoring those aspects of society we find uncomfortable. Equality creates a more fair society or leaves us alone. So many votes are for self-interest, “it is fairer to me.”&nbsp; Transparency will hold those in power to account or it will only make or worse. Open networks might create new business models on the web, but will they be sustainable? Sustainability is a false claim or it is our only option. Like books, and publications it is now complexity that is the tool that ensures power remains with the few.</p><p>We need to unpack the conflictual and tension-filled gaps in our beliefs, opinions and judgment because we depend on evidence to change our views. How evidence is presented and the systematic squeezing out of curiosity frames us and our current views.&nbsp;</p><p>Evidence, in this context, is actually a problem as we have a very divided idea of what evidence is.&nbsp; For some, evidence is a social media post from an influencer with 10 million followers (how can everyone else be wrong).&nbsp; For others a headline on the front of a tabloid newspaper is truth (is it printed.)&nbsp; For others, a statistical peer-reviewed leading journal publication that is cited 100 times is evidence.&nbsp; In terms of evidence for decision making, there is a gap between the evidence requirements for research and the evidence requirements for business decisions.&nbsp; To be clear, it is not that either is better; it is how we frame evidence that matters. The danger is being framed to believe something because there is a mismatch in the evidence requirements for a decision.&nbsp; A single 100% influencer claim without statistical proof say about “fertility” vs a statistical trial with probability highlights both how a claim is only a claim but many will not understand what evidence is.</p><p>Why is this important? Because the evidence we see in journals, TV, media, books and publications have different criteria and credentials to those that inform business decisions.&nbsp; Where is the environmental action being decided; in the board rooms!&nbsp; Is this gap in evidence leading to a sustainability gap?</p><p></p><br><p>Part 2. Analysis from Kahan&nbsp;</p><p>Here is the rub, it turns out that how scientific evidence is presented matters as its very presentation creates division.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://law.yale.edu/dan-m-kahan">Dan Kahan</a>, a Yale behavioural economist, has spent the last decade studying whether the use of reason aggravates or reduces “partisan” beliefs. His research papers are <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=45442">here</a>. His research shows that aggravation and alienation easily win, irrespective of being more liberal or conservative. The more we use our faculties for scientific thought, the more likely we will take a strong position that aligns with our (original) political group (or thought).</p><p>A way through this could be to copy “<a href="https://www.solutionsjournalism.org/">solution journalism</a>”, which reports on ways people and governments meaningfully respond to difficult problems and not on what the data says the problem is. Rather than use our best insights, analysis and thinking to reach the version of the “truth”, we use data to find ways to agree with others opinions in our communities. We help everyone to become curious. Tony Fish has created the <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/">Peak Paradox framework</a> as an approach to remaining curious by identifying where we are aligned and where there is a delta in views without conflict.</p><p>When we use data and science in our arguments and explain the problem, the individuals will selectively credit and discredit information in patterns that reflect their commitment to certain values. They (we) (I) assimilate what they (we)(I) want.</p><p>Kahan, in 2014, asked over <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2459057">1,500 respondents</a> whether they agreed or disagreed with the following statement: “There is solid evidence of recent global warming due mostly to human activity such as burning fossil fuels.” They collected information on individuals' political beliefs and rated their science intelligence.” The analysis found that those with the least science intelligence actually have less partisan positions than those with the most. A Conservative with strong science intelligence will use their skills to find evidence against human-caused global warming, while a Liberal will find evidence for it (cognitive bias.)</p><p></p><p>In the chart above, the y-axis represents the probability of a person agreeing that human activity caused climate change. The x-axis represents the percentile a person scored on the scientific knowledge test. The width of the bars shows the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval">confidence interval</a> for that probability.</p><br><p>Part 3. Are our policies being formed by the evidence we like or evidence we have?</p><p>Governments, activists, and the media have gotten better at holding corporations accountable for the societal repercussions of their actions. A plethora of groups score businesses based on their ESG&nbsp; performance, and despite often dubious methodology, these rankings are gathering a lot of attention. As a result, ESG has emerged as an unavoidable concern for corporate executives worldwide. ESG should be for boards for “purpose” or “are we doing the right thing” camp, but instead has ended up in the compliance camp, do the min, tick box.</p><p>For decades businesses have addressed sustainability as an end of pipe problem or afterthought. Rather than fundamentally altering their models to recognise that sustainability and wellbeing are critical parts for long term success, boards have typically delegated social issues to corporate social responsibility, compliance policies, or charitable foundations and associations, thus they publish their findings (which is not evidence) in annual reports. The issue becomes that neither investors nor stakeholders read these sustainability reports. Actually, they shouldn’t either.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Although investors' thinking on sustainability has evolved substantially over the past few decades, sustainability and efficiency leaders have used strategies to pressure corporations to advance a wide range of social concerns such as the SDGs across industries and supply chains, regardless of the financial considerations. As ESG assessments, sustainability reports or guidelines have become more rigorous; this accountability raises essential biases. This “pressure” has resulted in many types of actions and raised many concerns, including in the operational efficiencies supposed to reduce the use of energy and natural resources at the expense of their profitability.</p><p>Whilst it is still unclear if most investors utilise ESGs factors in their investment selection process based on evidence, it is clear that we do side with what we want to hear and not with the science, <a href="https://law.yale.edu/dan-m-kahan">Dan Kahan</a>, in part 2 above, was right.</p><br><p>Part 4. Null Hypothesis H(0) A lack of headspace for most people to think about the complexity of these issues due to meeting performance targets means leadership has to make time. And if it does not, we become the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>At what point do people care about something bigger than themselves? This means you as a person have the headspace to move from survival towards thriving. (PeakParadox.com)</p><p>If ⅓ of the world don’t know where the next meal today comes from, they will not have the headspace to worry about sustainability.</p><p>If the next additional ⅓ of the world don’t know where the food will come from for tomorrow, they will not have the headspace to worry about sustainability.</p><p>If the next ⅙ of the world will run out of food and money in 4 weeks - worrying about sustainability is not their most significant concern.</p><p>Less than ⅙ of the world can survive and think beyond four weeks - is that enough to make a difference, and are these people in roles that count?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Between than 0.01% and 0.001%&nbsp; (8m and 80m) people should be able to consider global complexity on the basis that they will never have money or food issues (over $1m in assets), but are they acting together and is their voice enough to make a difference?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Is leadership's first priority to ensure that first ⅚ have enough to survive and worry for them, but are they able to manage this conflict?&nbsp; Which group has the headspace to cope with recycling?&nbsp; What is amazing and worthy of note is that the majority of those who care about the environment, sustainability, recycling have created headspace irrespective of their situation. The argument above was designed to frame your thinking, the reality is we don’t create headspace because we are too busy.</p><p>Part 5.&nbsp; The imposter syndrome: followers are not followers</p><p>Politics (leadership), Business (leadership), Quango/ NGO (leadership), individuals (leadership), influencers (leadership) - all have different agendas, and demands for different outcomes as incentives drive in different directions. &nbsp; We lack sustainable leadership that drives in one direction.&nbsp;</p><p>As a Leader and opinion former, the most troubling finding should be that individuals with more “scientific intelligence” are the quickest to align themselves on subjects they don’t know anything about. In one experiment, Kahan analysed how people’s opinions on an unfamiliar subject are affected when given some basic scientific information, along with details about what people in their self-identified political group tend to believe about that subject. It turned out that those with the strongest scientific reasoning skills were most likely to use the information to develop partisan opinions.</p><p>Critically Kahan’s research shows that people that score well on a measure called “scientific curiosity” actually show less partisanship, and it is this aspect we need to use.</p><p>Do we need to move away from “truth”, “facts”, “data”, and “right decisions” if we want to have a board and senior team who can become aligned? We need to present ideas, concepts, how others are finding solutions and make our teams more curious. Being curious appears to be the best way to bring us together — however counterintuitive that is.&nbsp; But to do that, we have to give up on filling time, productivity, efficiency, effectiveness, keeping people busy and giving more people time to escape survival and work together for the better good.&nbsp;</p><p>There is a systematic squeezing out of curiosity in our current system.&nbsp; Are we to blame through schooling and education, and search engines? Have we lost how to be curious if the fact and truth presented to us is one that just aligns to our natural bias or one that challenges us? &nbsp; Do we spend sufficient time with others' views to be able to improve our own?&nbsp; Has individualism and personalisation created and reinforced our self opinions of our own views are correct?&nbsp; Does the advertising model depend on this divide?<br><br></p><p>Part 6. Conclusion, rationality and irrationality&nbsp; <br><br></p><p>There is a clear message to those in leadership; stop using evidence to create division, push people away or sure up your own camp. How do we take (all) evidence in and use it to ask questions which mean we come together for a common purpose?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Politics becomes irrational as we focus more on the individual and less on society and community. Politicians and policy formation need to be voted in, which means they have to mislead and misrepresent their populations who are acting in their own interests: therefore, we find evidence for decisions for short term gain based on individual preferences and not long term community - this is obvious but has to be said.&nbsp; The same is happening in many corporations.</p><p>Anger is often seen as a rational emotion, but that is because we focus on the evidence we want to justify the action. When you feel under-represented, threatened, or in harm's way - the evidence you want will fit the glove. Understanding how the evidence frames us is what brings value to the process.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Part 7. Call to action: The Road to Sustainability webinar series</p><p>We believe we have to communicate better, talk openly, listen to more, debate to appreciate, be curious and find a route to collaborate. The best way is to do something small.&nbsp; Sign up for the sessions below and bring your evidence, but be prepared to take away different evidence so we can make better decisions together.&nbsp;</p><p>The Road to Sustainability is a content and tool platform and initiative launched in October 2020 that started as a weekly email newsletter providing approaches and strategies to plan sustainability and innovation. We are launching the third edition of our webinar series, following up on the successful two previous versions, “From chaos to recovery: gateway to sustainability”.<br><br>This new series will take place every Monday through 5 meetings from October 4th to November 8th, with a possible extension of the plan.<br><br>The following schedule is based on our approach "<a href="https://event.theroadtosustainability.com.">Roadmap and product management - the new framework for sustainability conversations</a>".

<p>Zeynep Tufekci, in <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/07/why-arent-we-talking-more-about-airborne-transmission/614737/" title="We Need to Talk About Ventilation">a piece</a> for The Atlantic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jimenez also wondered why the National Guard hadn’t been deployed to set up
tent schools (not sealed, but letting air in like an outdoor wedding canopy)
around the country, and why the U.S. hadn’t set up the mass production of HEPA
filters for every classroom and essential indoor space. Instead, one
air-quality expert reported, teachers who wanted to buy portable HEPA filters
were being told that <a href="https://twitter.com/Poppendieck/status/1286300608836907009">they weren’t allowed</a> to, because the CDC wasn’t
recommending them. It is still difficult to get Clorox wipes in my
supermarket, but I went online to check, and there is no shortage of portable
HEPA filters. There is no run on them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s the profoundly irresponsible plan to reopen schools without any remotely
sufficient attempt to upgrade and modernize the air circulation systems of our
dilapidated public school buildings that disturbs me. Meanwhile, school
reopening proposals pay undue attention to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/07/scourge-hygiene-theater/614599/" title="Hygiene Theater Is a Huge Waste of Time">hygiene theater</a> to assuage fears,
while very real risks go largely unaddressed.<a>1</a> It simply won’t
work, and that means disastrous outcomes for communities.</p>
<p>And it’s not like there aren’t ways to get things under better control. Tufekci
continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, Japan masked up early, focused on <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32611985/" title="Cluster-based approach to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) response in Japan-February-April 2020">super-spreader events</a> (a strategy
it calls “<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-japan-beat-coronavirus-without-lockdowns-11594163172" title="How Japan Beat Coronavirus Without Lockdowns">cluster busting</a>”), and, crucially, trained its public to focus on
avoiding the three C’s—closed spaces, crowded places, and close conversations.
In other words, exactly the places where airborne transmission and aerosols
could pose a risk. The Japanese were advised not to talk on the subway, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-japan-has-long-accepted-covids-airborne-spread-and-scientists-say-ventilation-is-key/" title="Japan has long accepted COVID's airborne spread, and scientists say ventilation is key">where
windows were kept open</a>. Oshitani said they also developed guidelines that
included the importance of ventilation in many different settings, such as
bars, restaurants, and gyms. Six months later, despite having some of the
earliest outbreaks, ultradense cities, and one of the oldest populations in
the world, Japan has had about 1,000 COVID-19 deaths total—which is how many
the United States often has in a single day. Hong Kong, a similarly dense and
subway-dependent city, has had only 24 deaths.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The U.S. needs to get it shit together. We have the wealth and knowledge to do
this right, but need to put empathy for each other ahead of temporary political
and economic impacts to do so.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>In fairness, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200717104323/https://www.schools.nyc.gov/school-year-20-21/return-to-school-2020/health-and-safety">Health and Safety</a> section the New York
City DOE’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200709171600/https://www.schools.nyc.gov/school-year-20-21/return-to-school-2020">Return to School 2020-2021</a> plan says that the “DOE will make
improvements to HVAC systems, as well as air conditioning repairs, to improve
air circulation, as well as replacing regular air filters with higher
efficiency types.” Still, there’s a social failing here, national leaders
ought to fund the upgrading of air circulation systems to the highest
standards in every school and classroom in the United States.&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a></p>

<p>After seven years of development and hundreds of production database
deployments, I finally decide it was time to release <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/DWHEELER/App-Sqitch-v1.0.0">Sqitch v1.0.0</a>, and
today’s the day. I took the opportunity to resolve all known bugs in previous
releases, so there’s no new functionality since <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/DWHEELER/App-Sqitch-0.9999">v0.9999</a>. Still, given the
typical attention given to a significant milestone release like 1.0.0, my

<p>It used to be that dairy farmers relied on whatever was growing in the area to feed their cattle. They filled the trough with vegetation grown right on the farm. They probably relied heavily on whatever grasses grew naturally and perhaps added some high-value grains like barley and corn. Today, with better technology and knowledge, dairy farmers work with nutritionists to develop a personalized concentrate of carbohydrates, proteins, fats, minerals, and vitamins that gets added to the natural feed. The result is much healthier cattle and more predictable growth.<br><br>We’re going through a similar enlightenment in the security space. To get the best results, we need to fill the trough that our Machine Learning will eat from with high-value data feeds from our existing security products (whatever happens to be growing in the area) but also (and more precisely for this discussion) from beyond what we typically consider security products to be.</p><p>In the post, I make the case that "we shouldn’t limit our security data to what has traditionally been in-scope for security discussions" and how understanding Application Topology (and feeding that knowledge into the security trough) can help reduce risk and improve security.</p><p>Here's an excerpt:</p><p></p><p></p><p>We’re all guilty of thinking myopically at times. It’s easy to get  caught up thinking about the objects in our foreground and to lose our  sense of depth. We forget about the environment and the context and we  focus too narrowly on some singular subject. It’s not always a bad  thing. Often, we need to focus very specifically to take on challenges  that would otherwise be too big to address. For example, security  professionals spend a lot of time thinking about specific attack vectors  (or security product categories). And each one perhaps necessarily  requires a deep level of focus and expertise. I’m not arguing against  that. But I’d like to suggest that someone on the team should expand  their focus to think about the broader environment in which cyberattacks  and security breaches take place. When you do, I suspect that you’ll  find that there are data points from outside of the typical security  realm that, if leveraged correctly, will dramatically improve your  ability to respond to threats within that realm.</p> <p>I posted recently about the importance of <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/cloudsecurity/convergence-security">convergence</a> (of security functionality). I noted that “Security solutions are  evolving toward cloud, toward built-in intelligence via Machine  Learning, and toward unified, integrated-by-design platforms.” I went on  to suggest that forward-looking security platforms are autonomous and  operate with minimal human intervention. I believe that’s where we’re  heading. But to better enable machine learning and autonomous security,  we need to feed as much relevant data as possible into the system. We  need to feed the machine from an expanding trough of data. And with  Internet scale as an enabler, we shouldn’t limit our security data to  what has traditionally been in-scope for security discussions.</p> <p>As an example, I’m going to talk about how understanding Application Topology (and feeding that knowledge into the security trough) can help reduce risk and improve your security posture.</p> <p>What is Application Topology?</p> <p>As you likely know, modern applications are typically architected  into logical layers or tiers. With web and mobile applications, we’ve  traditionally seen a presentation layer, an application or middleware  tier, and a backend data tier. With serverless compute and cloud  microservice architectures, an application’s workload may be even more  widely distributed. It’s even common to see core application functions  being outsourced to third parties via the use of APIs and open  standards. Application Topology understands all the various parts of an  application and how they’re interrelated. Understanding the App Topology  means that you can track and correlate activity across components that  may reside in several different clouds.</p> <p>How does Application Topology impact security?</p> <p>Consider an application that serves a package delivery service. It  has web, mobile, and API interfaces that serve business line owners,  delivery drivers, corporate accounts, and consumer customers. It’s core  application logic runs on one popular cloud platform while the data  storage backend runs on another. The application leverages an identity  cloud service using several authentication techniques for the several  audiences. It calls out to a third-party service that feeds traffic  &amp; weather information and interacts with other internal applications  and databases that provide data points such as current pricing based on  regional gas prices, capacity planning, and more. Think about what it  means to secure an application like this.</p> <p>Many popular security tools focus only on one layer or one component.  A tool may scan the web application or the mobile app but probably not  both. An app like this might have a few different security products that  focus on securing APIs and a few others that focus on securing  databases. Even if all components feed their security events into a  common stream, there’s not likely a unified view of the risk posture for  the application as a whole. None of the security tools are likely to  understand the full application topology. If the app owner asked for a  security report for the entire application, would you be able to provide  it? How many different security products would you need to leverage?  Would you be able to quantify the impact of a single security  configuration issue on the application as a whole?</p> <p>If a security solution fully understands the application topology and  incorporates that knowledge, here are a few of the benefits: You can  generate a holistic report on the application to the app owner that  covers all components whether on-premises, in the cloud, or via  third-parties. You can monitor user activity at one tier and understand  how that impacts your risk posture across other tiers. You can monitor  for security configuration changes at all components via a unified  service and automatically adjust risk scores accordingly. In other  words, a deep understanding of the IT infrastructure underneath the  application yields a more robust understanding of security issues and an  increased ability to respond quickly and automatically.</p> <p>Summary</p> <p>Challenge yourself to expand the scope of which data points might be  useful for improving security. Are security appliance event logs and  threat feeds enough? As we enter an era dominated by AI and Machine  Learning, we need to add as much high-value data as possible into the  security trough. ML performs better as it incorporates more information.  And as Larry Ellison famously said, the threats are becoming  increasingly more sophisticated. “It can't be our people versus their  computers. We're going to lose that war. It's got to be our computers  versus their computers.” We must rely on Machine Learning and we have to  feed it with as much intelligence from as many sources as possible.</p><p></p>

<p>I published a new article today on the <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/cloudsecurity/">Oracle Security blog</a> that looks at the benefits of convergence in the security space as the IT landscape grows more disparate and distributed.<br><br>Security professionals have too many overlapping products under management and it's challenging to get quick and complete answers across hybrid, distributed environments. It's challenging to fully automate detection and response. There is too much confusion about where to get answers, not enough talent to cover the skills requirement, and significant hesitation to put the right solutions in place because there's already been so much investment.<br><br>Here's an excerpt:</p><p>The whole of your security portfolio should provide significantly more value than the sum of its parts.</p> <p>The challenge facing security professionals seems to grow bigger and  more complex by the hour. New threats and risk factors are constantly  emerging while the IT landscape continuously evolves. At times, it feels  like we’re patching holes on a moving target that’s endlessly  shape-shifting. One of the major contributing factors to those feelings  of chaos and disorder is the sheer quantity of security products that we  rely on to cover our vast IT landscapes.</p> <p>The <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/cloud-threat-report.html">Oracle and KPMG Cloud Threat Report 2018</a> found that cybersecurity professionals manage an average of 46  different security products. 7% of respondents reported being personally  responsible for managing over 100 different products. 100 different  security products! I don’t imagine that those folks can possibly have a  complete understanding of what’s happening across 50 or 100 different  security products or what value each of those products is contributing  to reducing their risk. This quantity of products alone contributes to  the overall challenge in several ways, including:</p>   Product Overlap: Security products often have  significant functional overlap. In an environment with several security  products, it quickly becomes unclear which product will answer which  questions. The result is wasted time and effort and longer delays  getting critical answers. When addressing an on-going attack or a  breach, the speed of the response effort is critical. The longer it  takes, the broader the damage will be.  Skills Shortage: Organizations spend too much time  finding or developing talent across security products. It’s rare for  security professionals to have the exact mix of skills and experience  that an organization needs. And with an on-going skills shortage, it’s  difficult to retain top talent over long periods of time. Again, not  having the right expertise in place means that you’re more likely to  miss the signals of developing attacks or on-going breaches and to  demonstrate longer response times to security events.  Delays in Addressing Gaps: Nobody likes wasted money or shelfware.  When a gap is found in an organization’s security posture, security  professionals are less likely to find and deploy the right solution if  they have numerous other security solutions in place that may (or may  not) fix the problem. Of course, without a complete understanding of  where the limits are on each of those products, it could take months to  sort through them and to formulate an approach. It’s the classic human  response of freezing in indecision when there are too many factors to  consider. When it comes to addressing information security issues, the  last thing you want to do is freeze.   <p>So, what can be done and how can we address the issue?</p> <p>Here’s the good news: Security solutions are evolving toward cloud,  toward built-in intelligence via Machine Learning, and toward unified,  integrated-by-design platforms. This approach eliminates the issues of  product overlap because each component is designed to leverage the  others. It reduces the burden related to maintaining skills because  fewer skills are needed and the system is more autonomous. And, it  promotes immediate and automated response as opposed to indecision.  While there may not be a single platform to replace all 50 or 100 of  your disparate security products today, platforms are emerging that can  address core security functions while simplifying ownership and  providing open integration points to seamlessly share security  intelligence across functions.</p> <p>For example, you know that you need an identity and access component  for addressing access management needs across numerous SaaS applications  and IaaS services. And you need a <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/paas/casb-cloud-service.html">Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB)</a> to scan SaaS applications and Cloud Infrastructures for insecure  configurations and to monitor user activity. But, for the most part,  these functions are silo’ed today. One doesn’t talk to the other. But  they can. And they should.</p> <p>Understanding what a user is doing across cloud applications  (visibility often provided by CASB) enables you to create a risk score  for that user that can then be used by the Identity function to make  decisions and take actions such as stepping up authentication,  requesting approvals, initiating an access review, or denying access.  Understanding that a target system’s configuration was modified recently  or that it doesn’t conform to the organization’s security policies also  increases risk. And there are numerous sources of additional risk data:  identity, CASB, security configuration scanning, SIEM, UEBA, external  threat feeds, session context, etc.</p> <p>Forward-looking security platforms will leverage hybrid cloud  architecture to address hybrid cloud environments. They’re autonomous  systems that operate without relying on human maintenance, patching, and  monitoring. They leverage risk intelligence from across the numerous  available sources. And then they rationalize that data and use Machine  Learning to generate better security intelligence and feed that improved  intelligence back to the decision points. And they leverage built-in  integration points and orchestration functionality to automate response  when appropriate.</p> <p>In other words, your security platform should serve as a central  brain that doesn’t only import the various security data points but also  makes sense of it without relying on human eyes to catch potential  threats. And it adds intelligence, identifies patterns, recognizes  anomalies, and responds appropriately and within seconds. This is much  more advanced than the old SIEM model which simply aggregates data from  numerous sources and tries to raise alerts for humans to evaluate. This  is a system that thinks for you and leverages advanced analytics to make  decisions across those numerous disparate systems. It’s a cloud service  so you don’t need to administer and manage it. You become a user; a  consumer of its benefits rather than a caretaker. And the result is much  more value and further reduced risk than you’d get from the parts  alone.</p>

<p>I published an article today on the <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/cloudsecurity">Oracle Cloud Security blog</a> that takes a look at how approaches to information security must adapt to address the needs of the future state (of IT). For some organizations, it's really the current state. But, I like the term future state because it's inclusive of more than just cloud or hybrid cloud. It's the universe of Information Technology the way it will be in 5-10 years. It includes the changes in user behavior, infrastructure, IT buying, regulations, business evolution, consumerization, and many other factors that are all evolving simultaneously.<br><br>As we move toward that new world, our approach to security must adapt. Humans chasing down anomalies by searching through logs is an approach that will not scale and will not suffice.&nbsp;</p><p>Here's an excerpt:<br><br></p>    <p>If you never change tactics, you lose <br>the moment the enemy changes theirs<br></p><p>While chasing down a domestic terrorist, FBI Agent Will Brody found  himself in an unfamiliar and dangerous environment. (Brody is the  protagonist in Marcus Sakey's 2017 novel Afterlife.) To survive  in its perilous conditions, its residents commit to two simple rules:  (1) pull your own weight and (2) only kill in self-defense. These rules  have kept them safe from the obvious imminent threats around them for  decades. But Brody sees a change happening in the environment that  others don't yet see and warns his new community: "If you never change  tactics, you lose the moment the enemy changes theirs." His mantra  becomes "New World, New Rules." In other words, you must adapt to changing threats or face the consequences.</p> <p>As Information Security professionals, we find ourselves in a similar  situation. Our environment is transforming rapidly. The assets we're  protecting today look very different than they did just a few years ago.  In addition to owned data centers, our workloads are being spread  across multiple cloud platforms and services. Users are more mobile than  ever. And we don’t have control over the networks, devices, or  applications where our data is being accessed. It’s a vastly distributed  environment where there’s no single, connected, and controlled network.  Line-of-Business managers purchase compute power and SaaS applications  with minimal initial investment and no oversight. And end-users access  company data via consumer-oriented services from their personal devices.  It's grown increasingly difficult to tell where company data  resides, who is using it, and ultimately where new risks are emerging. This transformation is on-going and the threats we’re facing are  morphing and evolving to take advantage of the inherent lack of  visibility.</p> <p>Organizations are in varying stages of migration toward this future state of IT where we have massive distribution and where visibility is elusive. But  we all seem to be moving in the same direction. So, we simply can't  live by the same old rules. We can’t rely on old security techniques. New World, New Rules.</p>   <p>The old SIEM approach won't suffice <br>in the future state. <br></p><p>Traditionally, security professionals have relied heavily on SIEM  (Security Information and Event Management) solutions to track activity  in their environments. The SIEMs resided somewhere on the network and  collected logs and event information from other network-connected  systems and devices. SIEMs measured themselves by their ability to  ingest data from anything and everything on the network. But SIEM users have struggled to translate that event data into actionable intelligence. In many cases, because of the enormous quantity of event data and the  inability to parse it quickly and efficiently, SIEM solutions became  forensic tools; used after-the-fact to research what may have happened  after a breach was detected. The old SIEM approach won't suffice in the  future state.</p> <p>Although many organizations report struggling with the complexity and  cost of SIEM solutions, the SIEM market continues to expand. This is  because the need for visibility has only grown more urgent with  increasing regulations and more aggressive and sophisticated attack  techniques. But you want more. Traditional SIEM approaches aren't enough. There simply aren't enough hands-on-deck to rely on manual processes  for investigating event data or identifying on-going attacks.</p><p>The technologies that have exacerbated the <br>problem can also be used to address it <br></p><p>Here's the good news: The technologies that have exacerbated the  problem can also be used to address it. On-premises SIEM solutions based  on appliance technology may not have the reach required to address  today's IT landscape. But, an integrated SIEM+UEBA designed from the  ground up to run as a cloud service and to address the massively  distributed hybrid cloud environment can leverage technologies like  machine learning and threat intelligence to provide the visibility and  intelligence that is so urgently needed.</p> <p><a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/cloudsecurity/machines-vs-machines-how-adaptive-intelligence-can-save-you-from-a-breach">Machine Learning (ML)</a> mitigates the complexity of understanding what's actually happening and of sifting through  massive amounts of activity that may otherwise appear to humans as  normal. Modern attacks leverage distributed compute power and ML-based  intelligence. So, countering those attacks requires a security solution  with equal amounts of intelligence and compute power. As Larry Ellison  recently said, "It can't be our people versus their computers. We're  going to lose that war. It's got to be our computers versus their  computers."</p> <p>But to effectively secure the future state, you need more than a SIEM  designed for cloud. Here are a few other innovations that we should  demand from our security platform:</p>   Application Topology Awareness: Detect multi-tier application attacks and lateral movement indicators. Alert application owners not server administrators.  Threat Stage Awareness: Map potential and  in-progress threats to well understood attack stages to provide better  contextual data on how to respond. See developing threats before they  happen.  Data-Deep Visibility: Detect data access anomalies for any user, database or application.  Broad Data Capture: Don't rely solely on security logs. Leverage operational logs, threat feeds, embedded reputation data, and more.  User Attribution: Report the identity even if the user context is missing via composite identity awareness and rich user baselines.  Configuration Change Awareness: Inject configuration drift context into threat detection.  Orchestration: Respond to threats immediately and with precision via REST, scripts, or 3rd party automation frameworks.   <p>Obviously, we're writing about this for a reason. These features are built into Oracle's <a href="https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/security-analytics">Security Monitoring and Analytics</a> service (SMA). When we say that our SIEM was designed from the ground  up for cloud, we're not just talking about the product architecture.  We're talking about its features and functionality. It was designed to  address the complexity and peril of distributed cloud environments. It was designed to secure the future state; to be the new rules for the new world.</p> <p>SMA is built on Oracle’s unified platform for future-state security that also includes <a href="https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/identity">Identity</a>, <a href="https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/casb">CASB</a>, and <a href="https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/compliance">Configuration Compliance</a>.  It was built 100% in the cloud to address the security needs of hybrid,  multi-cloud environments. Traditional SIEMs lack Identity, CASB, and  Configuration Compliance functions. And they typically only layer UEBA  on top of their legacy SIEM architecture. They lack advanced features  like data-deep visibility, user attribution, <a href="https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/orchestration">orchestration</a>, and awareness of threat stages and application topology. Leveraging these innovations, Oracle's approach enables shorter investigations and faster response times while accommodating for all the complexity of the future state.</p><p>Oracle simplifies management and <br>security for the future state. <br></p><p>And, to top it off, Oracle's security services are built on <a href="https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/management">Oracle Management Cloud</a> which,  in addition to security, provides a single pane of glass for IT  monitoring, management, and analytics. Oracle simplifies management and  security for the future state, reducing cost and effort, and providing  richer intelligence across increasingly complex environments.</p> <p>Learn more about how Oracle is addressing these security concerns and  incorporating machine learning into adaptive intelligence by reading  our whitepaper, <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/solutions/cloud/future-of-cyber-security-4302684.pdf">"Machine Learning-Based Adaptive Intelligence: The Future of Cybersecurity."</a></p>
