  <p>After <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/weeknotes/">192 posts</a> that ranged from weekly to roughly once-a-month, I've decided to call a wrap on my weeknotes habit. The <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2019/Sep/13/weeknotestwitter-sqlite-datasette-rure/">original goal</a> was to stay transparent during my 2019-2020 JSK fellowship, and I kept them up after that as an accountability mechanism and to get into a habit of writing regularly.</p>
<p>Over the past two years I've adopted new posting habits which are solving those problems in other ways:</p>
 
 I post something here almost every day. I actually maintained a daily posting streak throughout 2024, which I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/2/ending-a-year-long-posting-streak/">ended in January</a>, but I'm still posting most days and plan to keep that up. 
 Every time I ship a new release of one of my projects I link to it from here. This replaces the "recent releases" section of my weeknotes. 
 I try to have a longer form piece of writing that's suitable for inclusion in <a href="https://simonw.substack.com/">my newsletter</a> at least once every two weeks. That's another accountability mechanism that's working well for me. 
 
<p>One downside of weeknotes is that I'd sometimes save something to include in them, which could lead to several items getting bundled together in a way that reduced their potential impact as standalone posts.</p>
<p>I got to the point with weeknotes where I was feeling guilty about not keeping them up. Given the volume of content I'm publishing already that felt like a sign that they were no longer providing the value they once did!</p>
<p>I still think weeknotes are an excellent habit for anyone who wants to write more frequently and be more transparent about their work. It feels healthy to be able to end a habit that's finished serving its purpose.</p>

   OpenAI platform: o1-pro 
OpenAI have a new most-expensive model: o1-pro can now be accessed through their API at a hefty $150/million tokens for input and $600/million tokens for output. That's 10x the price of their o1 and o1-preview models and a full 1,000x times more expensive than their cheapest model, gpt-4o-mini! 
 Aside from that it has mostly the same features as o1: a 200,000 token contex

  <p><a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/o1-pro">OpenAI platform: o1-pro</a></p>
OpenAI have a new most-expensive model: o1-pro can now be accessed through their API at a hefty $150/million tokens for input and $600/million tokens for output. That's 10x the price of their o1 and o1-preview models and a full 1,000x times more expensive than their cheapest model, gpt-4o-mini!<p></p>
<p>Aside from that it has mostly the same features as o1: a 200,000 token context window, 100,000 max output tokens, Sep 30 2023 knowledge cut-off date and it supports function calling, structured outputs and image inputs.</p>
<p>o1-pro doesn't support streaming, and most significantly for developers is the first OpenAI model to only be available via their new <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses">Responses API</a>. This means tools that are built against their Chat Completions API (like my own <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a>) have to do a whole lot more work to support the new model - my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/839">issue for that is here</a>.</p>
<p>Since LLM doesn't support this new model yet I had to make do with <code>curl</code>:</p>
 <code>curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(llm keys get openai)" \
  -d '{
    "model": "o1-pro",
    "input": "Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle"
  }'
</code> 
<p>Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/0439d0255360c68b8f621133860710b1">the full JSON</a> I got back - 81 input tokens and 1552 output tokens for a <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/llm-prices">total cost</a> of 94.335 cents.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I took a risk and added <code>"reasoning": {"effort": "high"}</code> to see if I could get a better pelican with more reasoning:</p>
 <code>curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(llm keys get openai)" \
  -d '{
    "model": "o1-pro",
    "input": "Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle",
    "reasoning": {"effort": "high"}
  }'
</code> 
<p>Surprisingly that used less output tokens - 1459 compared to 1552 earlier (cost: 88.755 cents) - <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/085d81e1160157572c9bd361b01374c4">producing this JSON</a> which rendered as a slightly better pelican:</p>
<p></p>
<p>It was cheaper because while it spent 960 reasoning tokens as opposed to 704 for the previous pelican it omitted the explanatory text around the SVG, saving on total output.

<p></p><p>I cleaned out my desk a little over five years ago. It feels like last week.</p><p>I was leading engineering at <a href="https://forusall.com">ForUsAll</a>, a fintech company that seeks to make it easier for small businesses to offer retirement plans for their employees. The co-founder, David, had been wearing a mask around the office for a month; he was following the growth of COVID-19 closely. The then-CEO agreed to close the office if the number of cases in San Francisco went beyond some small threshold; when it did, we picked up our laptops and left.</p><p>Of course, we all know what happened next: lockdowns, sourdough starters, and remote working on a scale never seen before.</p><p>I prefer remote working and always have. My first startup was mostly remote: my co-founder was in Edinburgh for a while, and spent some time in Vancouver, while I was in Oxford with occasional long stretches in California. I worked at my kitchen table, drank my own coffee, and set my own hours. It was flexible depending on what was going on at the time, and undoubtedly productive. When I joined a startup based in Austin but worked from Edinburgh and Berkeley, it felt like a natural progression.</p><p>When the pandemic hit, I couldn’t wait to return to that mode of working. I had another reason to feel like working from home was a silver lining: my mother’s health had been up and down following her double lung transplant, and now I could spend more time with her. What had been a regular Sunday visit became a much longer weekly stay. My dad was the primary carer, but I could help out. Many nights, I would help her up the short flight of stairs to her bedroom, help situate her in her bed, with brushing her teeth, and so on. Working from home gave me extra time with her, and I treasured that.</p><p>More recently, it allowed me to buy a house. There was no way I could buy in the San Francisco Bay Area. For literally half the price of a two-bedroom house in a troubled part of Oakland, I could get a house that would fit my family in Pennsylvania. We walk our child to and from daycare every day, have a garden and a driveway, and, although there’s no doubt that the house needs work, generally feel safe and secure.</p><p>I’m far from alone. Working from home has been a boon for carers, parents, and anyone who felt like they weren’t able to get on the property ladder in major business hubs like San Francisco and New York. It’s spread wealth from industries like tech to neighborhoods across the country, and in turn allowed tech companies to hire from anywhere, giving them access to talent that would previously have been out of reach. According to official figures from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, <a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/volume-13/remote-work-productivity.htm">productivity rose</a>.</p><p>For remote work to be successful, communication, internal processes, and norms need to be explicit. Companies that had never spent much time thinking about culture now found that they were forced to, which was a positive outcome for their employees, many of whom had been suffering in silence. A renewed focus on employee power — in conjunction with the rise of social movements like Black Lives Matter — also led to a rise in unionization efforts, which also aimed to improve worker quality of life. Despite the overhead of the pandemic itself, these changes felt like they were part of a cohesive, positive movement.</p><p>So I read stories <a href="https://sfstandard.com/2025/03/18/san-francisco-in-office-work-era/">like this one in the San Francisco Standard</a> with something like a sense of dread:</p><blockquote><p>“Two years ago, I could not get anybody to go into the office a couple days a week,” said Jaimie Feliz, principal at San Francisco recruiting firm The Hire Standard. “Now, across the board, it’s pretty standard for companies to ask for a minimum of three days in office — it’s very rare to see any less than that.”</p></blockquote><p>Many tech companies are suspending hiring and promotions for workers outside of their hub cities, and there’s an assumption that, over time, employees who remain outside of those hubs will be laid off.</p><p>Given the negative impacts on carers, parents, people who have bought homes outside of those hub cities, and on the productivity of those companies, this feels like a regression.</p><p>This is doubly true when you look at the underlying statistics. One of the big reasons for calls back to the office&nbsp;<a href="https://www.itpro.com/business/business-strategy/business-execs-just-said-the-quiet-part-out-loud-on-rto-mandates-a-quarter-admit-forcing-staff-back-into-the-office-was-meant-to-make-them-quit-but-this-quiet-firing-practice-could-easily-backfire">is to perform backdoor layoffs</a>: management understands that a substantial percentage will quit.&nbsp;Research also suggests that <a href="https://www.workdesign.com/2024/10/reasons-behind-rto-mandates/">it’s about control</a>:</p><blockquote><p>RTO mandates may reflect a desire among certain leaders to reassert control and authority within the organization […] This perspective highlights the role of organizational power dynamics and the potential for RTO policies to serve as instruments for reinforcing traditional hierarchical structures, at odds with the trend towards greater autonomy and flexibility facilitated by remote work.</p></blockquote><p>The perceived gains aren’t evidence-based or in the best interests of company productivity; they’re more about CEO peace of mind. For companies that never stuck the landing on building intentional cultures, returning to the pre-pandemic status quo may feel reassuring.</p><p>Frustratingly, I now feel like these changes are inevitable.</p><p>Not everywhere, of course. There are some companies that have always been remote, and others have managed to establish strong hybrid cultures. But the majority will choose to simply snap back to the world as it was in 2019.</p><p>This is to their detriment: adding perspectives from across the country, and from people who would have been shut out of a traditional office job, was clearly valuable. A workforce made up only of people who can afford San Francisco’s $3,400 average rent is inherently less diverse — and less representative of the company’s customers — than one that is geographically diverse. Regardless, it is happening.</p><p>For companies that choose to stay remote, there are benefits to be made. There will be an ever-increasing workforce of potential employees who don’t want to move back to those hubs, with experience at tech companies like Google and Meta, who will be looking for new positions. That’s a competitive advantage.</p><p>On the other hand, for people who want to stay with their current employers, there are hard choices ahead. Do you move away from your comfortable house, or find ways to offload some of your caring or parental duties, in order to stay on the payroll? Depending on your salary, stock options, or tenure, there might be reasons for doing so.</p><p>But it’s not a choice I would make. I have a toddler these days, and I want to be more present, not less. I get a lot of value from in-person collaboration, but I prefer a hybrid model: I’ll gladly travel into the office for a few intense days to advance some specific goals and then go home. I’ve got little interest in doing so to make management feel at ease, but there really are some kinds of time-limited collaboration that are better in person.</p><p>I also know that some people can’t travel — for health reasons, because their caring commitments are too great, or these days, because they’re worried about their documents being stripped or suffering violence because of their identity. So even though I’m willing to travel, I don’t expect everyone else to. Even in specific, time-limited collaborations, hybrid accommodations must be made.</p><p>For these reasons, I’ve made the decision that I won’t work for a company that requires everyone to come back to the office. Should I start another company, I will not mandate that people work from the office, although I might provide one as an optional collaboration space. This is to protect my quality of life, and to ensure that I can hire the best people for each role, regardless of where they might live or what the rest of their life might look like.</p><p>It’s not a decision I take lightly. It’s limiting: it means, should I leave my current job, that there will be fewer places I can go and work. It might limit my salary and future prospects, or even the investment I can raise for a future venture. But I care about being home and present, and I care about building representative workforces.</p><p>The bottom line is this: forcing people back into offices isn’t a neutral decision. It’s a choice to exclude and disadvantage anyone who doesn’t fit a narrow definition of what a “worker” looks like. I’m not willing to join in that discrimination.</p>

<p><a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">IIW, the Internet Identity Workshop</a>, is the UN of identity. While located in the U.S., it has always represented and welcomed the whole world to work on global problems best addressed in person.</p>
<p>As it happens, IIW was born exactly twenty years ago tomorrow—20 March 2005—at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esther_Dyson">Esther Dyso</a>n’s PC Forum in Scottsdale, Arizona. A group of eleven that called itself the Identity Gang gathered around a table there to plot what became (IMHO) the most leveraged conference in the world. Three of the eleven were Canadians. One (Esther) was born in Zurich. As for the rest, I suppose they could have been born anywhere. (I was born in the U.S., but half my ancestors were Swedish. Those on my father’s side were Irish, English, German, French, and God knows.)</p>

  <p>Vibe coding is having a moment. The term <a href="https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383">was coined by Andrej Karpathy</a> just a few weeks ago (on February 6th) and has since been featured <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/27/technology/personaltech/vibecoding-ai-software-programming.html">in the New York Times</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/is-vibe-coding-with-ai-gnarly-or-reckless-maybe-some-of-both/">Ars Technica</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/mar/16/ai-software-coding-programmer-expertise-jobs-threat">the Guardian</a> and countless online discussions.</p>
<p>I'm concerned that the definition is already escaping its original intent. I'm seeing people apply the term "vibe coding" to all forms of code written with the assistance of AI. I think that both dilutes the term and gives a false impression of what's possible with responsible <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-assisted-programming/">AI-assisted programming</a>.</p>
<p>Vibe coding is not the same thing as writing code with the help of LLMs!</p>
<p>To quote Andrej's <a href="https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383">original tweet</a> in full (with my emphasis added):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There's a new kind of coding I call "vibe coding", where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists. It's possible because the LLMs (e.g. Cursor Composer w Sonnet) are getting too good. Also I just talk to Composer with SuperWhisper so I barely even touch the keyboard.</p>
<p>I ask for the dumbest things like "decrease the padding on the sidebar by half" because I'm too lazy to find it. I "Accept All" always, I don't read the diffs anymore. When I get error messages I just copy paste them in with no comment, usually that fixes it. The code grows beyond my usual comprehension, I'd have to really read through it for a while. Sometimes the LLMs can't fix a bug so I just work around it or ask for random changes until it goes away.</p>
<p>It's not too bad for throwaway weekend projects, but still quite amusing. I'm building a project or webapp, but it's not really coding - I just see stuff, say stuff, run stuff, and copy paste stuff, and it mostly works.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I love this definition. Andrej is an extremely talented and experienced programmer - he has no need for AI assistance at all. He's using LLMs like this because it's fun to try out wild new ideas, and the speed at which an LLM can produce code is an order of magnitude faster than even the most skilled human programmers. For low stakes projects and prototypes why not just let it rip?</p>

<p>When I talk about vibe coding I mean building software with an LLM without reviewing the code it writes.</p>

 Using LLMs for code responsibly is not vibe coding 
<p>Let's contrast this "forget that the code even exists" approach to how professional software developers use LLMs.</p>
<p>The job of a software developer is not (just) to churn out code and features. We need to create code that demonstrably works, and can be understood by other humans (and machines), and that will support continued development in the future.</p>
<p>We need to consider performance, accessibility, security, maintainability, cost efficiency. Software engineering is all about trade-offs - our job is to pick from dozens of potential solutions by balancing all manner of requirements, both explicit and implied.</p>
<p>We also need to read the code. My golden rule for production-quality AI-assisted programming is that I won't commit any code to my repository if I couldn't explain exactly what it does to somebody else.</p>
<p>If an LLM wrote the code for you, and you then reviewed it, tested it thoroughly and made sure you could explain how it works to someone else that's not vibe coding, it's software development. The usage of an LLM to support that activity is immaterial.</p>
<p>I wrote extensively about my own process in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/11/using-llms-for-code/">Here’s how I use LLMs to help me write code</a>. Vibe coding only describes a small subset of my approach.</p>
 Let's not lose track of what makes vibe coding special 
<p>I don't want "vibe coding" to become a negative term that's synonymous with irresponsible AI-assisted programming either. This weird new shape of programming has so much to offer the world!</p>
<p>I believe everyone deserves the ability to automate tedious tasks in their lives with computers. You shouldn't need a computer science degree or programming bootcamp in order to get computers to do extremely specific tasks for you.</p>
<p>If vibe coding grants millions of new people the ability to build their own custom tools, I could not be happier about it.</p>
<p>Some of those people will get bitten by the programming bug and go on to become proficient software developers. One of the biggest barriers to that profession is the incredibly steep initial learning curve - vibe coding shaves that initial barrier down to almost flat.</p>
<p>Vibe coding also has a ton to offer experienced developers. I've talked before about how <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/11/using-llms-for-code/">using LLMs for code is difficult</a> - figuring out what does and doesn't work is a case of building intuition over time, and there are plenty of hidden sharp edges and traps along the way.</p>
<p>I think vibe coding is the best tool we have to help experienced developers build that intuition as to what LLMs can and cannot do for them. I've published more than <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon">80 experiments</a> I built with vibe coding and I've learned so much along the way. I would encourage any other developer, no matter their skill level, to try the same.</p>
 When is it OK to vibe code? 
<p>If you're an experienced engineer this is likely obvious to you already, so I'm writing this section for people who are just getting started building software.</p>
 
 Projects should be low stakes. Think about how much harm the code you are writing could cause if it has bugs or security vulnerabilities. Could somebody be harmed - damaged reputation, lost money or something worse? This is particularly important if you plan to build software that will be used by other people! 
 Consider security. This is a really difficult one - security is a huge topic. Some high level notes:
 
 Watch out for secrets - anything that looks similar in shape to a password, such as the API key used to access an online tool. If your code involves secrets you need to take care not to accidentally expose them, which means you need to understand how the code works! 
 Think about data privacy. If you are building a tool that has access to private data - anything you wouldn't want to display to the world in a screen-sharing session - approach with caution. It's possible to vibe code personal tools that you paste private information into but you need to be very sure you understand if there are ways that data might leave your machine. 
 
 
 Be a good network citizen. Anything that makes requests out to other platforms could increase the load (and hence the cost) on those services. This is a reason I like <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/claude-artifacts/">Claude Artifacts</a> - their sandbox prevents accidents from causing harm elsewhere. 
 Is your money on the line? I've seen horror stories about people who vibe coded a feature against some API without a billing limit and racked up thousands of dollars in charges. Be very careful about using vibe coding against anything that's charged based on usage. 
 
<p>If you're going to vibe code anything that might be used by other people, I recommend checking in with someone more experienced for a vibe check (hah) before you share it with the world.</p>
 How do we make vibe coding better? 
<p>I think there are some fascinating software design challenges to be solved here.</p>
<p>Safe vibe coding for complete beginners starts with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_(computer_security)">sandbox</a>. Claude Artifacts was one of the first widely available vibe coding platforms and their approach to sandboxing is fantastic: code is restricted to running in a locked down <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>, can load only approved libraries and can't make any network requests to other sites.</p>
<p>This makes it very difficult for people to mess up and cause any harm with their projects. It also greatly limits what those projects can do - you can't use a Claude Artifact project to access data from external APIs for example, or even to build software that runs your own prompts against an LLM.</p>
<p>Other popular vibe coding tools like Cursor (which was initially intended for professional developers) have far less safety rails.</p>
<p>There's plenty of room for innovation in this space. I'm hoping to see a cambrian explosion in tooling to help people build their own custom tools as productively and safely as possible.</p>
 Go forth and vibe code 
<p>I really don't want to discourage people who are new to software from trying out vibe coding. The best way to learn anything is to build a project!</p>
<p>For experienced programmers this is an amazing way to start developing an intuition for what LLMs can and can't do. For beginners there's no better way to open your eyes to what's possible to achieve with code itself.</p>
<p>But please, don't confuse vibe coding with all other uses of LLMs for code.</p>

See the episode transcript at the top of this page, and a summary at the bottom.</p> Brought to You By <p>• <a href="https://workos.com/">WorkOS</a> — The modern identity platform for B2B SaaS.</p><p>• <a href="http://vanta.com/pragmatic">Vanta</a> — Automate compliance and simplify security with Vanta.</p><p>—</p> In This Episode <p>Linux is the most widespread operating system, globally – but how is it built? Few people are better to answer this than Greg Kroah-Hartman: a Linux kernel maintainer for 25 years, and one of the 3 Linux Kernel Foundation Fellows (the other two are Linus Torvalds and Shuah Khan). Greg manages the Linux kernel’s stable releases, and is a maintainer of multiple kernel subsystems. He is also the author of the books <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Linux-Kernel-Nutshell-Desktop-Reference-ebook/dp/B0026OR3OY?ref_=ast_author_mpb">Linux Kernel in a Nutshell</a> and <a href="https://lwn.net/Kernel/LDD3/">Linux Device Drivers</a>.</p><p>We cover the inner workings of Linux kernel development, exploring everything from how changes get implemented to why its community-driven approach produces such reliable software. Greg shares insights about the kernel's unique trust model and makes a case for why engineers should contribute to open-source projects. We go into:</p>  <p>How widespread is Linux?</p>  <p>What is the Linux kernel responsible for – and why is it a monolith?</p>  <p>How does a kernel change get merged? A walkthrough</p>  <p>The 9-week development cycle for the Linux kernel</p>  <p>Testing the Linux kernel</p>  <p>Why is Linux so widespread?</p>  <p>The career benefits of open-source contribution</p>  <p>And much more!</p>       Takeaways <p>1. Linux is the most widespread operating system globally. Linux runs on 4 billion Android devices – compared to which everything else is “a rounding error”. Still, Linux is the most popular operating system for servers and embedded devices. It’s also used on many smart TVs, air traffic control systems, and even on the International Space Station. Fun fact: Linux even runs inside many iPhones – as it is the firmware used for the Qualcomm 5G modems inside these devices!</p><p>2. Getting a change merged into the Linux kernel is surprisingly straightforward. Create the change (called a patch), test it locally, and send it to the right maintainer for review. The patch needs to go through a hierarchical tree of maintainers accepting it before it can make it into the kernel. We go through a specific change being merged up this tree.</p><p>3. Linux won because devs being “selfish” works! Developers contribute to Linux in a "selfish" way to solve their own problems. But turns out, many devs have the same problems: so every contribution makes Linux a better fit for other devs to use! Kernel maintainers only accept contributions that make sense for the whole project. For example, embedded device vendors helped make the Linux kernel more efficient. This efficiency later greatly helped Linux become the best choice for mobile OS on Android.</p><p>4. The Linux kernel is run in a very unique way – because the project is unique. The Linux kernel has 4,000 contributors per year, releases strictly every 9 weeks – and yet has practically no meetings, no project managers and uses email and git. This setup works because project management happens outside of the Linux kernel: contributors bring completed work. Also, the kernel team invests heavily in automation for e.g. triaging. And turns out, email scales really well – for this group, that is! (Note that other projects built on top of the Linux kernel – such as Linux distributions like Red Hat or Debian – all work differently. What works for the Linux kernel thanks to unique circumstances, won’t work for those projects).</p><p>5. Git was created as a solution for the Linux kernel’s source control needs. We talked about this story with Greg outside the podcast: it’s a fascinating story about how git was built and open-sourced after the Linux kernel group was unhappy with existing source control solutions.</p><p>In what is amusing: git has become the de facto source control product across tech thanks to products like GitHub and GitLab. The Linux kernel does not use GitHub – don’t forget, they already solved their source control workflow problems by writing git!</p> The Pragmatic Engineer deepdives relevant for this episode   <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/what-tpms-do">What TPMs do and what software engineers can learn from them</a></p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-past-and-future-of-backend-practices">The past and future of modern backend practices</a></p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/backstage">Backstage: an open-source developer portal</a></p>   Timestamps <p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw2DSPj1cLk">00:00</a>) Intro</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw2DSPj1cLk&amp;t=143s">02:23</a>) How widespread is Linux?</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw2DSPj1cLk&amp;t=360s">06:00</a>) The difference in complexity in different devices powered by Linux</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw2DSPj1cLk&amp;t=560s">09:20</a>) What is the Linux kernel?</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw2DSPj1cLk&amp;t=840s">14:00</a>) Why trust is so important with the Linux kernel development</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw2DSPj1cLk&amp;t=962s">16:02</a>) A walk-through of a kernel change</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw2DSPj1cLk&amp;t=1400s">23:20</a>) How Linux kernel development cycles work</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw2DSPj1cLk&amp;t=1795s">29:55</a>) The testing process at Kernel and Kernel CI</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw2DSPj1cLk&amp;t=1915s">31:55</a>) A case for the open source development process</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw2DSPj1cLk&amp;t=2144s">35:44</a>) Linux kernel branches: Stable vs. development</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw2DSPj1cLk&amp;t=2312s">38:32</a>) Challenges of maintaining older Linux code</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw2DSPj1cLk&amp;t=2430s">40:30</a>) How Linux handles bug fixes</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw2DSPj1cLk&amp;t=2680s">44:40</a>) The range of work Linux kernel engineers do</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw2DSPj1cLk&amp;t=2913s">48:33</a>) Greg’s review process and its parallels with Uber’s RFC process</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw2DSPj1cLk&amp;t=3108s">51:48</a>) Linux kernel within companies like IBM</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw2DSPj1cLk&amp;t=3232s">53:52</a>) Why Linux is so widespread</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw2DSPj1cLk&amp;t=3410s">56:50</a>) How Linux Kernel Institute runs without product managers</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw2DSPj1cLk&amp;t=3721s">1:02:01</a>) The pros and cons of using Rust in Linux kernel</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw2DSPj1cLk&amp;t=4195s">1:09:55</a>) How LLMs are utilized in bug fixes and coding in Linux</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw2DSPj1cLk&amp;t=4333s">1:12:13</a>) The value of contributing to the Linux kernel or any open-source project</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw2DSPj1cLk&amp;t=4600s">1:16:40</a>) Rapid fire round</p> A summary of the conversation  The Linux kernel   <p>The Linux kernel is around 40 million lines of code. The core kernel –the part every Linux platform runs – is about 5% of this. . The remaining code supports diverse hardware, drivers, devices, architectures, and chips.</p>  <p>A typical laptop runs approximately two to 2.5M million lines of kernel code; servers around 1.5M, while mobile devices around 4M.</p>  <p>The role of the kernel: abstract away underlying hardware and present a consistent interface to user space programs. This allows the applications to run on different hardware without modification.</p>  <p>A monolithic kernel</p>  <p>Drivers in Linux are part of the kernel</p>  <p>This is a monolithic architecture: all code, including drivers, operates in the same address space</p>  <p>The monolithic approach allows for more refactoring options and more code-sharing opportunities between drivers. This results in Linux drivers being, on average, one-third smaller than drivers in other operating systems because common functionalities can be identified and consolidated.</p>    <p>Do not break userspace. The core principle of Linux kernel development is to never intentionally break user space. This guarantee ensures that users can upgrade their kernel without fear of their existing applications crashing. Accidental breakages are treated as faults and are promptly addressed.</p>   Linux kernel development process   <p>Fixed 9-week cadence.</p>  <p>Following a release by Linus Torvalds, a two-week merge window opens.</p>  <p>During this merge window, maintainers submit all the new features that have been pending and proven to work in their respective development trees to Linus.</p>  <p>rc1: after the two-week merge window, Linus issues the first release candidate (rc1).</p>  <p>For the subsequent seven weeks, only bug fixes are accepted. No new features are introduced during this stabilization period; the focus is on regression fixes and reverting problematic changes.</p>    <p>Hierarchical structure of maintainers.</p>  <p>Around 4,000 developers contribute code every year</p>  <p>They send changes via email to maintainers responsible for specific kernel subsystems</p>  <p>Kernel subsystem maintainers then forward collections of accepted changes up the chain</p>  <p>Ultimately, these changes reach Linus for inclusion in the main kernel tree.</p>    <p>Trust is key in Linux kernel development. When a maintainer accepts code from a developer, they implicitly take responsibility for it. For critical parts of the kernel, maintainers need to have a high degree of confidence in the developer and the quality of their work, as the maintainer becomes accountable if the original developer disappears.</p>  <p>Email and git. These are the two tools used during development.</p>  <p>"Linux Next:" a separate development tree that integrates all the changes destined for the next kernel release on a daily basis. This allows for continuous testing and identification of potential integration issues.</p>   QA and stable releases   <p>Linux Next: automated testing. This includes building and booting the kernel across various architectures and virtual machines.</p>  <p>KernelCI: a project that provides a more extensive continuous integration infrastructure, running tests on a wider range of real hardware contributed by different labs.</p>  <p>The testing process involves a mix of automated tests and real-world usage by developers and testers. The "zero-day bot" automatically tests patches submitted to mailing lists.</p>  <p>Stable kernel releases: these are maintained independently of the main development branch. After each major kernel release by Linus, a stable branch is forked.</p>  <p>Greg&nbsp;and Sasha Levin maintain these stable branches.&nbsp;They issue new stable releases weekly, incorporating bug fixes that have first been merged into Linus's tree. This ensures that stable branches do not diverge from the main development line.</p>    <p>Long-term stable (LTS) kernels: Greg picks one kernel per year and supports it for an extended period, initially two years, sometimes up to six years. Android phones, for instance, often run on these older LTS kernels, which still receive backported bug fixes. Greg and Sasha concurrently maintain multiple LTS kernels.</p>  <p>Maintaining older codebases is more challenging. This is due to the ongoing evolution of the kernel. Changes made in newer versions to fix bugs might be difficult to backport to older, significantly diverged code. Context is often lost over time, making even seemingly simple backports complex.</p>   Contributors   <p>About 80% of kernel contributors are paid – by their employer! Companies invest in Linux development because it's often more cost-effective to contribute features and fixes than to develop their own operating systems.</p>  <p>Contributing to the Linux kernel is a valuable way for developers to also invest in their careers. It demonstrates the ability to collaborate, work with existing codebases, and solve real-world problems.</p>  <p>Core maintainers meet annually to discuss and refine the development process.</p>   Rust support?   <p>Most of Linux is written in C, but Rust is gaining momentum. Approximately 25,000 lines of Rust code are already in the kernel, primarily for bindings but also for some functionality like generating QR codes on kernel crashes.</p>  <p>Introducing Rust aims to improve memory safety in certain parts of the kernel. However, writing drivers in Rust presents challenges due to the need for bindings to the extensive C codebase and the different memory management models of C and Rust.</p>  <p>Memory safety in Rust primarily refers to the safety of object lifecycles and memory ownership, not necessarily the elimination of all bugs. Logic errors and even memory unsafety can still occur in Rust code.</p>  <p>The adoption of Rust is also driving improvements in the existing C codebase, as the need to create Rust bindings encourages a re-evaluation of C code for better safety and clarity.</p>    <p>Will the Linux kernel add Rust support?</p>  <p>There is resistance to introducing new languages from some core kernel developers, who prefer to maintain a single-language codebase.</p>  <p>Efforts are underway to write more drivers in Rust, including experimental GPU drivers. Rust can be particularly well-suited for simpler hardware drivers.</p>  <p>Governments increasingly mandate the use of memory-safe languages, which is another factor driving the adoption of Rust in Linux.</p>  <p>That said, the Linux kernel community is also actively working on improving the safety of existing C code through techniques like bounds checking and compiler extensions.</p>     Why contribute to Linux, and how?   <p>Building and testing the kernel locally is a prerequisite for submitting changes.</p>  <p>Contributing, even a single patch, offers significant professional benefits. It strengthens a developer's resume by demonstrating the ability to collaborate and work with complex, established codebases.</p>  <p>Contributing provides valuable learning opportunities, exposing devs to different perspectives, coding practices, and challenging technical problems.</p>  <p>Newcomers can find entry points by working on less critical parts of the kernel, such as fixing coding style issues or removing dead code in older drivers.

   My Thoughts on the Future of "AI"

  <p><a href="https://nicholas.carlini.com/writing/2025/thoughts-on-future-ai.html">My Thoughts on the Future of "AI"</a></p>
Nicholas Carlini, previously deeply skeptical about the utility of LLMs, discusses at length his thoughts on where the technology might go.<p></p>
<p>He presents compelling, detailed arguments for both ends of the spectrum - his key message is that it's best to maintain very wide error bars for what might happen next:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wouldn't be surprised if, in three to five years, language models are capable of performing most (all?) cognitive economically-useful tasks beyond the level of human experts. And I also wouldn't be surprised if, in five years, the best models we have are better than the ones we have today, but only in “normal” ways where costs continue to decrease considerably and capabilities continue to get better but there's no fundamental paradigm shift that upends the world order. To deny the potential for either of these possibilities seems to me to be a mistake.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If LLMs do hit a wall, it's not at all clear what that wall might be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I still believe there is something fundamental that will get in the way of our ability to build LLMs that grow exponentially in capability. But I will freely admit to you now that I have no earthly idea what that limitation will be. I have no evidence that this line exists, other than to make some form of vague argument that when you try and scale something across many orders of magnitude, you'll probably run into problems you didn't see coming.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's lots of great stuff in here. I particularly liked this explanation of how you get R1:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You take DeepSeek v3, and ask it to solve a bunch of hard problems, and when it gets the answers right, you train it to do more of that and less of whatever it did when it got the answers wrong. The idea here is actually really simple, and it works surprisingly well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Missing Mike. My favorite songwriter and performer is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Cross_(musician)">Mike Cross</a>. He was headed to a career in law as an undergrad at UNC-Chapel Hill when a music bug bit him, he learned to play fiddle and guitar, and then to perform in local bars and clubs. I couldn’t count how many times I went to hear him play. His songs were—and still are—fun, deep, wise, and catchy. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzTvGYYO6lI">Uncle Josh</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMKOvdnBvTE">The Scottsman</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehsqtmTzULM">Elma Turl</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jL962ytAVfQ">Nobby</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGpZYVzbMjs">Born in the Country</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRFa8qlEZlQ">The Lord’ll Provide</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7AcEzOUkNY">Bounty Hunter</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOmXpWywotw">Kentucky Song</a>. A few years ago Mike was bitten by a tick, got Lyme Disease, and has hardly been heard from since. I hope he’s well and can get back out there, showing the next few generations what an amazing gift he is to us all. Bonus fact: The album cover above is by my old friend and business partner <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2011/11/29/remembering-ray/">Ray Simone</a>. Gone thirteen years, I still miss Ray every day.</p>
<p>Drowning in Red. Fifty years ago, when I was <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2017/04/26/where-the-nickname-came-from/">getting my nickname</a> while working at <a href="https://archives.lib.duke.edu/catalog/uawdbs2">WDBS</a>&nbsp;(a sweet little commercial radio station owned by Duke University in Durham, North Carolina), our slogan was “Let the music keep our spirits high”—a line from Jackson Browne’s “Before the Deluge.” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SX-HFcSIoU">Give it a listen</a>. Take in the lyrics. Then think about the kind and generous purposes behind all the federal programs, agencies, and departments now being demolished. The abandoned alliances and international friendships. The dropped American support for people and organizations trying to do good throughout the world. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-listened-to_radio_programs">Voice of America</a>, silenced. Think about the new political corrections:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://grantwritingandfunding.com/banned-and-trigger-words-in-federal-grant-writing-in-the-trump-administration-2-0/">forbidden words</a>&nbsp;in grant applications, red flags now waving atop corporate giants, weather vanes vectored right. Think about the shaking trap doors under millions of federal employees—especially ones tasked with helping the weak, the old, the foreign, the oppressed, the dark, the gay, the oddly gendered. And then listen to the news. No, not the old bluestream news we still call main. I mean the <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2024/11/16/the-redstream-media/">redstream</a> news that now predominates <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-still-ratings-viagra-cable-160000910.html">on TV</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/genre/1530">in podcasts</a>, <a href="https://barrettmedia.com/2025/01/09/barrett-news-media-top-20-of-2024-national-news-talk-radio-shows/">on radio</a>. What you will see and hear is one big amen corner for all of it. This is the deluge.</p>
<p>Sounding Good Everywhere. If you like old album rock and Americana rooted in North Carolina, the best thing on radio in&nbsp;Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill is <a href="https://www.thatstation.net/">That Station</a>, on 95.7 FM.&nbsp; Technically, the station translates (rebroadcasts) WRAL-FM/101.5’s HD2 stream, and rarely mentions its true callsign, which is <a href="https://radio-locator.com/info/W239CK-FX?loc=35.92042%2C-79.08393&amp;locn=Carrboro%2C%20North%20Carolina">W239CK</a>. What many listeners may not know is that the signal on 95.7 is only 250 watts from an antenna about 1100 feet up a tower near Apex, while the HD2 stream is coming from WRAL’s 98,000 watt signal pumping out of its antenna almost 2000 feet up a tower southeast of Raleigh. Compare the two signal footprints <a href="https://radio-locator.com/cgi-bin/pat?call=W239CK&amp;service=FX">here</a> and <a href="https://radio-locator.com/cgi-bin/pat?call=WRAL&amp;service=FM">here</a> (thanks to the wonderful RadioLocator.com). Naturally, the station also has an app. That’s what I usually use here in Bloomington, Indiana, although right now I’m digging it on my computer, which has outstanding 2.1 Logitech speakers I picked up for $5 at a yard sale.</p>

<p>We’d like to know what tools, languages, frameworks and platforms you are using today. Which tools/frameworks/languages are popular and why? Which ones do engineers love and dislike the most at this moment in time?</p><p>With more than 950,000 tech professionals subscribed to this newsletter, we have a unique opportunity to take the industry’s pulse by finding out which tech stacks are typical – and which ones are less common.</p><p>So, we want to build a realistic picture of this – and share the findings in a special edition devoted to this big topic. But it’s only possible with input from you.</p><p>We’re asking for your help to answer the question: what’s in your tech stack? To help, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScGzqM1NOXhqSKSalDkDE47tRLQYoSqOmDg0uNWKpuSZ4JWKg/viewform?usp=dialog">please fill out this survey</a> all about it. Doing so should only take between 5-15 minutes, covering the platform(s) you work on, the tooling you use, the custom tools you have built, and related topics.</p><p>The results will be published in a future edition of The Pragmatic Engineer. If you take part and fill out the survey, you will receive the full results early, plus some extra, exclusive analysis from myself and Elin.</p><p>This is the first time we’re running a survey that’s so ambitious – and we very much appreciate your help. Previous research we did included a <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/ai-tooling-2024">reality check on AI tooling</a> and <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/genz-part-2">what GenZ software engineers really think</a>. This survey is even more ambitious – and the results should reveal people’s typical and atypical tooling choices, across the tech industry.

Adults also didn’t feel properly informed of Amazon’s inclination to keep Alexa recordings unless prompted not to until 2019—five years after the first Echo came out."</p></blockquote><p>It was a nice idea, but it's time to give them a rest. There are plenty of use cases for smart agents, but they don't need to be listening to you all the time like you live in some kind of science fiction movie.

Spectacular new open geospatial project by <a href="https://sno.ws/">Dan Snow</a>:<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>OpenTimes is a database of pre-computed, point-to-point travel times between United States Census geographies. It lets you download bulk travel time data for free and with no limits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's <a href="https://opentimes.org/?id=060816135022&amp;mode=car#9.76/37.5566/-122.3085">what I get</a> for travel times by car from El Granada, California:</p>
<p></p>
<p>The technical details are fascinating:</p>
<blockquote>
 
 The entire OpenTimes backend is just static Parquet files on <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/products/r2/">Cloudflare's R2</a>. There's no RDBMS or running service, just files and a CDN. The whole thing costs about $10/month to host and costs nothing to serve. In my opinion, this is a great way to serve infrequently updated, large public datasets at low cost (as long as you partition the files correctly). 
 
</blockquote>
<p>Sure enough, <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/pricing/">R2 pricing</a> charges "based on the total volume of data stored" - $0.015 / GB-month for standard storage, then $0.36 / million requests for "Class B" operations which include reads. They charge nothing for outbound bandwidth.</p>
<blockquote>
 
 All travel times were calculated by pre-building the inputs (OSM, OSRM networks) and then distributing the compute over <a href="https://github.com/dfsnow/opentimes/actions/workflows/calculate-times.yaml">hundreds of GitHub Actions jobs</a>. This worked shockingly well for this specific workload (and was also completely free). 
 
</blockquote>
<p>Here's a <a href="https://github.com/dfsnow/opentimes/actions/runs/13094249792">GitHub Actions run</a> of the <a href="https://github.com/dfsnow/opentimes/blob/a6a5f7abcdd69559b3e29f360fe0ff0399dbb400/.github/workflows/calculate-times.yaml#L78-L80">calculate-times.yaml workflow</a> which uses a matrix to run 255 jobs!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Relevant YAML:</p>
 <code>  matrix:
    year: ${{ fromJSON(needs.setup-jobs.outputs.years) }}
    state: ${{ fromJSON(needs.setup-jobs.outputs.states) }}
</code> 
<p>Where those JSON files were created by the previous step, which reads in the year and state values from <a href="https://github.com/dfsnow/opentimes/blob/a6a5f7abcdd69559b3e29f360fe0ff0399dbb400/data/params.yaml#L72-L132">this params.yaml file</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
 
 The query layer uses a single DuckDB database file with views that point to static Parquet files via HTTP. This lets you query a table with hundreds of billions of records after downloading just the ~5MB pointer file. 
 
</blockquote>
<p>This is a really creative use of DuckDB's feature that lets you run queries against large data from a laptop using HTTP range queries to avoid downloading the whole thing.</p>
<p>The README shows <a href="https://github.com/dfsnow/opentimes/blob/3439fa2c54af227e40997b4a5f55678739e0f6df/README.md#using-duckdb">how to use that from R and Python</a> - I got this working in the <code>duckdb</code> client (<code>brew install duckdb</code>):</p>
 <code>INSTALL httpfs;
LOAD httpfs;
ATTACH 'https://data.opentimes.org/databases/0.0.1.duckdb' AS opentimes;

SELECT origin_id, destination_id, duration_sec
  FROM opentimes.public.times
  WHERE version = '0.0.1'
      AND mode = 'car'
      AND year = '2024'
      AND geography = 'tract'
      AND state = '17'
      AND origin_id LIKE '17031%' limit 10;
</code> 
<p>In answer to a question about adding public transit times <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43392521#43393183">Dan said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the next year or so maybe. The biggest obstacles to adding public transit are:</p>
 
 Collecting all the necessary scheduling data (e.g. GTFS feeds) for every transit system in the county. Not insurmountable since there are services that do this currently. 
 Finding a routing engine that can compute nation-scale travel time matrices quickly. Currently, the two fastest open-source engines I've tried (OSRM and Valhalla) don't support public transit for matrix calculations and the engines that do support public transit (R5, OpenTripPlanner, etc.) are too slow. 
 
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://gtfs.org/">GTFS</a> is a popular CSV-based format for sharing transit schedules - here's <a href="https://gtfs.org/resources/data/">an official list</a> of available feed directories.

Mistral Small 3 came out in January and was a notable, genuinely excellent local model that used an Apache 2.0 license. 
 Mistral Small 3.1 offers a significant improvement: it's multi-modal (images) and has an increased 128,000 token context length, while still "fitting within a single RTX 4090 or a 32GB RAM MacBook once quantized" (according to their model card). Mistral's own

Mistral Small 3 <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/30/mistral-small-3/">came out in January</a> and was a notable, genuinely excellent local model that used an Apache 2.0 license.<p></p>
<p>Mistral Small 3.1 offers a significant improvement: it's multi-modal (images) and has an increased 128,000 token context length, while still "fitting within a single RTX 4090 or a 32GB RAM MacBook once quantized" (according to their <a href="https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-Small-3.1-24B-Instruct-2503">model card</a>). Mistral's own benchmarks show it outperforming Gemma 3 and GPT-4o Mini, but I haven't seen confirmation from external benchmarks.</p>
<p>Despite their mention of a 32GB MacBook I haven't actually seen any quantized GGUF or MLX releases yet, which is a little surprising since they partnered with Ollama on launch day for their previous Mistral Small 3. I expect we'll see various quantized models released by the community shortly.</p>
<p>The model is available via their <a href="https://docs.mistral.ai/api/">La Plateforme API</a>, which means you can access it via my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-mistral">llm-mistral</a> plugin.</p>
<p>Here's the model describing <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/two-pelicans.jpg">my photo of two pelicans in flight</a>:</p>
 <code>llm install llm-mistral
# Run this if you have previously installed the plugin:
llm mistral refresh
llm -m mistral/mistral-small-2503 'describe' \
  -a https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/two-pelicans.jpg
</code> 
<blockquote>
<p>The image depicts two brown pelicans in flight against a clear blue sky. Pelicans are large water birds known for their long bills and large throat pouches, which they use for catching fish. The birds in the image have long, pointed wings and are soaring gracefully. Their bodies are streamlined, and their heads and necks are elongated. The pelicans appear to be in mid-flight, possibly gliding or searching for food. The clear blue sky in the background provides a stark contrast, highlighting the birds' silhouettes and making them stand out prominently.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/commit/f528e115e3fc487e3f5c5435d7cc04dd7314dd91">added Mistral's API prices</a> to my <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/llm-prices">tools.simonwillison.net/llm-prices</a> pricing calculator by pasting screenshots of <a href="https://mistral.ai/products/la-plateforme#pricing">Mistral's pricing</a> tables <a href="https://claude.ai/share/a9313f0d-274c-48d2-9d77-346fe68556a5">into Claude</a>.

 [Benedict Collins at TechRadar]  This was always inevitable, but in the current environment it makes sense that it's accelerating:   "Several major European tech companies are pushing for greater action from the European Union to reduce the bloc’s reliance on foreign-owned infrastructure by buying and building locally.

The solution therefore is to foster growth at home."</p></blockquote><p>The implication is that there's already a market here. Hosting in the US puts you at risk of certain kinds of subpoenas and other actions by the state, and the current political environment makes that even less desirable. (I've certainly personally had plenty of advice from security experts this year to not host in the US.) But if the only really great cloud hosting providers are US-based, that's a problem (even if they offer non-US hosting zones).</p><p>To be competitive here, the EU needs to consider privacy and freedom from surveillance as paramount values. That's not always been the case for it: there have always been voices who have pushed for things like backdoors in encryption and greater monitoring from police and security services. Those things will kill any EU effort to provide alternatives. The EU's great strengths in comparison to the US are greater openness and stronger protections of human rights; it should lean into those.</p>

<p>LIVE告知です。メタバース進化論の著者のバーチャル美少女ねむさんとYouTube Live を行います。</p>



<p>・配信日時：3月29日（土）21:00より1.5時間程度予定<br>・YouTube LIVEにて無料配信<br>・配信URL：<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tyUY9NpZeU">「分人経済革命」ねむ ✕ 崎村夏彦 徹底対談【次世代ネットの扉を開く革命の起こしかた】</a></p>



<p>バーチャル美少女ねむさんは、黎明期の仮想世界で生きる「メタバース原住民」にして、その文化を伝える「メタバース文化エバンジェリスト」として活動しておられます。「バーチャルでなりたい自分になる」をテーマに2017年から美少女アイドルとして活動している自称・世界最古の個人系VTuber。メタバースの革命性を論じた著書『<a href="https://amzn.to/4hDlXQ4">メタバース進化論</a>』（2022年、技術評論社）で「<a href="https://www.shoeisha.co.jp/campaign/award/2023/result">ITエンジニア本大賞2023</a>」ビジネス書部門”大賞”を受賞。国連の国際会議「<a href="https://www.soumu.go.jp/igfkyoto2023/">IGF京都2023</a>」でも登壇。MoguLive VTuber Award 2023では「<a href="https://www.moguravr.com/mogulive-vtuber-award-2024-vtuber/">今年最も輝いたVTuber</a>」に選出されています。2024年には定性調査レポート「<a href="https://note.com/nemchan_nel/n/n9a4ca9f667a2">メタバースでのアイデンティティ（Nem x Mila, 2024）</a>」を発表。<a href="https://unit.aist.go.jp/harc/daax/d_cns_standardization.html">産総研「アバター国際標準化の国内検討委員会」</a><a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2025/03/6797/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-6797" title="ISO IEC/JTC1/SC35専門委員会関連">1</a>委員にも就任されておられます。</p>



<p>ねむさんが課題として捉えられていることに分人経済が新たな経済圏に昇華するためのID認証・経済・納税の仕組みがあります。たとえば、</p>



 
 バーチャルでアバターの形でしか会わない取引先にどうしてマイナンバーカードの表裏をコピーして郵送しなければならないのか？ 
 



<p>もちろん、適正な課税のためには税務当局がマイナンバーを使って支払いを把握することが必要であることは論を待ちません。しかし、だからといってマイナンバーカードのオモテ裏のコピーを郵送したりして身元確認情報を拡散させたり、望まない名寄せが行われるリスクをとる必要があるのでしょうか？多くのVTuberの方にしてみれば、「顔バレ」を含む「身バレ」は最大のリスクの一つです。こうしたリスクを抑えたうえで、ひとびとが経済活動を行い、一方税務当局は本人のマイナンバーを抑えることができて適正な課税をする仕組みはつくれないのでしょうか？これは実はVTuberだけでなく、ひろく一般の方々にかんしても言えることです。</p>



<p>こうしたことについて、目標1.5時間でいろいろお話をしたいと思います。</p>



<p>ねむさん曰く：</p>



<blockquote>
<p>次世代インターネットの扉を開くという「分人経済革命」とは果たして何なのか！？ 仮想空間「メタバース」ではアバターによって複数の自分（分人）を切り替え、自己の魂の在り方と社会との界面を能動的にデザインできる新時代が遂に実現しつつある。一方でそれを新たな経済圏に昇華するためのID認証・経済・納税の仕組みは全くの未整備なのが現状だ。インターネットにおけるデジタルアイデンティティの標準化に長年取り組んできたOpenID Foundation理事長「崎村夏彦」とメタバース住人にしてVTuber/作家「バーチャル美少女ねむ」が3/29にYouTube LIVEでこの問題を徹底対談！ 次世代インターネットの革命がここから始まる！？（出所：<a href="https://note.com/nemchan_nel/n/neac6dc0eee04">【告知】3/29「分人経済革命」ねむ ✕ 崎村夏彦 徹底対談【次世代ネットの扉を開く革命の起こしかた】</a>）</p>

 The poll doesn’t have good news for Democrats, either. The Democratic Party has reached an all-time low in popularity, with only 27% of respondents holding a positive view — its lowest positive rating in NBC News polling dating back to 1990. And the slump is partially driven by fed-up Democrats who want the party to fight Trump harder.

Behind every “from sea to shining sea” there is a Trail of Tears. Behind every first pitch at Dodger Stadium there’s the destruction of Chavez Ravine. Behind every moonshot there’s a Nazi V2 rocket.

Treating the current moment as completely new doesn't serve us: it erases those struggles and historic injustices. That's not to say that everything is good right now - it's obviously not - but the road that led us here is clearly marked throughout American history.</p>

<p>Here is what a <a href="https://news.google.com/search?q=voice+of+america">Google News search for Voice of America</a> looks like right now:</p>
<p><a href="https://news.google.com/search?q=voice+of+america"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/15/nx-s1-5329244/bloody-saturday-voiceofamerica-radio-free-asia-europe-trump-kari-lake">‘Bloody Saturday’ at Voice of America and other U.S.-funded networks</a>, by <a href="https://www.npr.org/people/4459112/david-folkenflik">David Folkenflik</a> at NPR, begins with this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Journalists showed up at the Voice of America today to broadcast their programs only to be told they had been locked out: Federal officials had embarked on indefinite mass suspensions.</p>
<p>All full-time staffers at the Voice of America and the Office for Cuba Broadcasting, which runs&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_y_Televisi%C3%B3n_Mart%C3%AD">Radio and Television Martí</a>, were affected — more than 1,000 employees. The move followed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/03/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-continues-the-reduction-of-the-federal-bureaucracy/#:~:text=ELIMINATING%20WASTE%20AND%20REDUCING%20GOVERNMENT,what%20is%20required%20by%20law.">a late Friday night edict from President Trump</a>&nbsp;that its parent agency, called the U.S. Agency for Global Media, must eliminate all activities that are not required by law.</p>
<p>In addition, under the leadership of Trump appointees, the agency has severed all contracts for the privately incorporated international broadcasters it funds, including Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia and the Middle East Broadcasting Networks.</p>
<p>The termination notices for grants for the funded networks, two of which were reviewed by NPR, carried the signature of Trump’s senior adviser&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/12/12/nx-s1-5226920/voice-of-america-kari-lake-voa">Kari Lake</a>, whom he placed at USAGM, not the agency’s acting chief executive. Lake does not appear in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/10/nx-s1-5322493/radio-free-europe-asia-liberty-voice-of-america-usagm-kari-lake-doge">her current job</a>&nbsp;to have the statutory authority to carry out that termination.</p></blockquote>
<p>She may not, but here is how <a href="https://www.usagm.gov/">the USAGM site</a> looks, above the fold, this morning:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.usagm.gov/"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.usagm.gov/2025/03/15/u-s-agency-for-global-media-complies-with-presidential-executive-order-to-reduce-the-federal-bureaucracy/">Here is the story</a> behind that image:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today, in compliance with President Trump’s Executive Order titled,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/continuing-the-reduction-of-the-federal-bureaucracy/">Continuing the Reduction of the Federal Bureaucracy</a>, dated March 14, 2025, the US Agency for Global Media initiated measures to eliminate the non-statutory components and functions to the maximum extent consistent with applicable law. USAGM and the outlets it oversees will be reduced to their statutory functions and associated personnel will be reduced to the minimum presence and function required by law.</p>
<p>This action will impact the agency’s workforce at USAGM, Voice of America, Office of Cuba Broadcasting, and all Grantees. Most USAGM staff affected by this action will be placed on paid-administrative leave beginning Saturday, March 15, 2025, and remain on leave until further notice.</p>
<p>“While at USAGM, I vow to fully implement President Trump’s executive orders in his mission to reduce the size and scope of the federal government. Today we continue the process of doing that by streamlining our operations to what is statutorily required by law,” said USAGM Senior Adviser, Kari Lake. “The US Agency for Global media will continue to deliver on all statutory programs that fall under the agency’s purview and shed everything that is not statutorily required. I fully support the President’s executive order. Waste, fraud, and abuse run rampant in this agency and American taxpayers shouldn’t have to fund it.”</p>
<p>A few of the most egregious findings:</p>
 
 Massive national security violations, including spies and terrorist sympathizers and/or supporters infiltrating the agency 
 Eye-popping self-dealing involving contracts, grants and high-value settlement agreements 
 Obscene over-spending including a nearly quarter-of-a-billion-dollar lease for a Pennsylvania Avenue high-rise that has no broadcasting facilities to meet the needs of the agency and included a $9 million commission to a private real estate agent with connections 
 $100s-of-millions being spent on fake news companies 
 a product that often parrots the talking-points of America’s adversaries 
 
<p>This agency is not salvageable.</p>
<p>From top-to-bottom this agency is a giant rot and burden to the American taxpayer—a national security risk for this nation—and irretrievably broken. While there are bright spots within the agency with personnel who are talented and dedicated public servants, this is the exception rather than the rule.</p>
<p>It is unfortunate that the work that was done by self-interested insiders in coordination with outside activist groups and radical Leftist advocacy organizations to “Trump-Proof” the agency made it impossible to reform. In fact, they weren’t just “Trump-Proofing” the agency from political leadership, they were accountability-proofing the agency from the American people.&nbsp; They did all this while spending taxpayer money to create false narratives. These were amplified by biased media counterparts with clear conflicts of interest at the Washington Post, NPR and more, to actively cover up their obscene waste, fraud, and abuse.</p>
<p>“This is a significant step toward restoring the greatness of the United States and promoting freedom and democracy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Going forward, I am going to ensure accountability will be the norm and not the exception.&nbsp;I appreciate the work of the dedicated public servants and their contributions to the Agency and its outlets.&nbsp;I look forward to moving forward with modernizing the core mission of telling America’s story throughout the world in a meaningful, impactful and effective way,” Lake added.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whether you agree with it or not, this is not a news story. It’s the kind of shit one hears from a junta after a coup.</p>
<p>As for Lake’s claim about the “obscenely expensive 15-year lease,” here’s what David Folkenflik reports in his ‘Bloody Saturday’ story:</p>
<blockquote>
 Lake’s claims of waste on new HQ challenged 
<p>On Friday evening, before Trump’s order, Lake posted a video of the new headquarters for USAGM and the Voice of America to argue that it’s an exemplar of profligate spending.</p>
<p>“I’m sitting here on the 13th floor of a shiny, brand-new beautiful skyscraper building that is costing you, the taxpayer, a fortune,”&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/KariLake/status/1900652489063481500">Lake said</a>, as camera footage lingered over features including glass walls, interior waterfalls, and modern conference rooms. “Here’s the kicker: They already have a building that they’re located in, that is paid off, that they could have renovated or updated.”</p>
<p>Former USAGM CFO Grant Turner says she’s got it backwards. According to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.usagm.gov/2024/09/27/u-s-agency-for-global-media-awards-lease-securing-voice-of-america-move-to-a-modern-new-downtown-d-c-headquarters/">the USAGM’s announcement last September</a>, the lease, thanks to a slow real estate market caused by the pandemic, stands to save the federal government $150 million over 15 years.</p>
<p>“That’s a bunch of lies and misinformation coming out of her mouth,” said Turner, who left the agency in January. “In fact, it’s probably one of the best deals struck by a tenant in D.C. history.”</p>
<p>Four USAGM and Voice of America staffers backed up Turner’s account on condition of anonymity, citing fears of retribution in the current climate. For one thing, they note, the new building is not new. It’s nearly two decades old —&nbsp;<a href="https://www.clarkconstruction.com/our-work/projects/1875-pennsylvania-avenue-nw">built in 2006</a>, according to the general contractor on the project. For another, the old building wasn’t “paid off” — the agency doesn’t own it. The agency got three years in free rent at the new headquarters, and was drawing staffers out of the old Wilbur J. Cohen building, they said, thus sizeably reducing its footprint and rent paid to the federal government.</p>
<p>And the new building’s landlord gave $27 million toward the construction of state-of-the-art studios. That would have been necessary in the technologically archaic Cohen building — absent the existential question now hovering over the networks.</p></blockquote>
<p>As Scott Adams says, Facts don’t matter. What matters is how much we hate the person talking.</p>
<p>The VOA isn’t one person. But it is a voice, and Trump and Lake clearly hate it.</p>
<p>Now, two questions:</p>
 
 Is the VOA still on the air? I’m asking around, and haven’t heard yet. 
 If it stays on, will it be in a politically corrected way that sounds like Fox News? Or will it go away completely? 
 
<p>Any guesses?</p>

   Backstory on the default styles for the HTML dialog modal 
My TIL about Styling an HTML dialog modal to take the full height of the viewport (here's the interactive demo) showed up on Hacker News this morning, and attracted this fascinating comment from Chromium engineer Ian Kilpatrick.

  <p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43378225#43380129">Backstory on the default styles for the HTML dialog modal</a></p>
My TIL about <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/css/dialog-full-height">Styling an HTML dialog modal to take the full height of the viewport</a> (here's the <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/side-panel-dialog">interactive demo</a>) showed up <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43378225">on Hacker News</a> this morning, and attracted this fascinating comment from Chromium engineer Ian Kilpatrick.<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There's quite a bit of history here, but the abbreviated version is that the dialog element was originally added as a replacement for window.alert(), and there were a libraries polyfilling dialog and being surprisingly widely used.</p>
<p>The mechanism which dialog was originally positioned was relatively complex, and slightly hacky (magic values for the insets).</p>
<p>Changing the behaviour basically meant that we had to add "overflow:auto", and some form of "max-height"/"max-width" to ensure that the content within the dialog was actually reachable.</p>
<p>The better solution to this was to add "max-height:stretch", "max-width:stretch". You can see <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/5936#discussion_r513642207">the discussion for this here</a>.</p>
<p>The problem is that no browser had (and still has) shipped the "stretch" keyword. (Blink <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/SiZ2nDt3B9E/m/kP_rKOaDAgAJ?pli=1">likely will "soon"</a>)</p>
<p>However this was pushed back against as this had to go in a specification - and nobody implemented it ("-webit-fill-available" would have been an acceptable substitute in Blink but other browsers didn't have this working the same yet).</p>
<p>Hence the calc() variant. (Primarily because of "box-sizing:content-box" being the default, and pre-existing border/padding styles on dialog that we didn't want to touch). [...]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I particularly enjoyed this insight into the challenges of evolving the standards that underlie the web, even for something this small:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One thing to keep in mind is that any changes that changes web behaviour is under some time pressure. If you leave something too long, sites will start relying on the previous behaviour - so it would have been arguably worse not to have done anything.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also from the comments I learned that Firefox DevTools can show you user-agent styles, but that option is turned off by default - <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/css/dialog-full-height#user-content-update-firefox-can-show-browser-styles">notes on that here</a>. Once I turned this option on I saw references to an <code>html.css</code> stylesheet, so I dug around and <a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/layout/style/res/html.css">found that in the Firefox source code</a>. Here's <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/gecko-dev/commits/HEAD/layout/style/res/html.css">the commit history</a> for that file on the official GitHub mirror, which provides a detailed history of how Firefox default HTML styles have evolved with the standards over time.</p>
<p>And <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43378225#43380255">via uallo</a> here are the same default HTML styles for other browsers:</p>

OLMo 2 32B claims to be "the first fully-open model (all data, code, weights, and details are freely available) to outperform GPT3.5-Turbo and GPT-4o mini". Thanks to the MLX project here's a recipe that worked for me to run it on my Mac, via my llm-mlx plugin. 
 To install the model: 
 llm install llm-mlx
llm mlx download-model mlx-community/OLMo-2-032

 <code>llm install llm-mlx

<p>The <code>-o unlimited 1</code> removes the cap on the number of output tokens - the default for <code>llm-mlx</code> is 1024 which isn't enough to attempt to draw a pelican.</p>

If you go there and slide the Weather Overlay up to the Storm Tracker view, the map will now see, in addition to colors for densities of rain, symbols for lightning and the paths of the heaviest storm cells, which are all currently in Mississippi and Tennessee.</p>
<p>This is a storm that has been edging eastward out of the Mississippi Valley and has already <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tornadoes-wildfires-deaths-eb53f6b2463a96b18a08ca9e2db266ab">killed at least seventeen people</a>.

<p>Note the brown wedge-shaped polygons. Those are storm paths.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lightningmaps.org/">LightningMaps.org</a> is another useful resource. Zoom in and it will show each lightning bolt, plus growing (and fading) circles around the bolt, displaying the spread of thunder. (By the way, not all lightning strikes ground, and many bolts stretch through and between thunderclouds.) Here’s Tupelo, Mississippi, a moment ago as I write this (3 PM Eastern time):</p>

<p>Oh, and one more:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.windy.com/-Weather-radar-radar?radar,32.623,-85.460,8"></a></p>
<p>That’s <a href="https://www.windy.com/-Weather-radar-radar?radar,32.623,-85.460,8">here</a> at Windy.com. The white areas are live lightning, with sound effects. Eastern Alabama is getting hit hard right now (11:45 PM Eastern). Big thanks to Tanya Weiman in the comments below for pointing me to it. I was already a Windy fan, but didn’t know about this feature.</p>
<p>I just noticed that it’s also on the Windy app, under “Weather Radar.” It’s free. Go get it.</p>

<p>My first love was self-sovereign distributed data, where each person owns and controls their data, hosting it wherever they choose and permissioning it under their own terms. But I got lost in the complexity of building a robust distributed identity infrastructure. How can you give permission to someone if you can’t 'name' them in a way that is verifiable and resistant to subversion? There's no point in saying "only John can access this" if Tom can show up and convincingly say, "I'm John."</p><p>This issue isn’t theoretical—many modern digital problems stem from weak identity foundations. Take email, for example. SMTP, the core protocol, evolved without a strong sense of identity. Had we designed email with a robust identity layer—and maybe a little reputation—spam might have been less rampant. Instead, we've had to patch identity onto email systems, mostly at the DNS layer. Could better choices early on have changed the landscape of digital trust?</p><p>As we enter the era of AI and Personal AI, this challenge resurfaces. We will increasingly rely on agents to interact, assist, and even make decisions on our behalf. But how can we trust these agents? How do we know they are who they claim to be, and whose interests they truly serve? When I ask my AI how to unwind after a long day, it might suggest a refreshing Diet Coke. But is that suggestion rooted in understanding my preferences, or is it influenced by unseen commercial incentives?</p><p>Recognition and Identity in AI</p><p>In the animal world, intelligence is often measured by the ability to recognize oneself and others. The mirror test is a classic example—when an animal identifies itself in a reflection, it demonstrates a form of self-awareness. Similarly, recognizing specific others—distinguishing one individual from another—marks advanced cognitive development.</p><p>AI, in contrast, remains limited in this capacity. While AI excels at pattern recognition, it lacks the ability to form a persistent sense of identity, either of itself or others. This limitation restricts its ability to build trust and context in interactions. Without a foundation for recognizing specific entities, AI systems risk becoming tools of confusion or exploitation.</p><p>Embedding Identity Systems into AI</p><p>One solution is to deeply embed identity frameworks into AI architectures from the outset. Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), Verifiable Credentials (VCs), and similar systems could provide AI with a structured way to "recognize" and differentiate entities.</p>  <p>Persistent Identity Chains: AI could track verifiable chains of identity, ensuring that when it reports information—like "Brad says buy this stock"—it can verify that it truly came from the Brad you trust.</p>  <p>Verification of Origin: By leveraging cryptographically verifiable credentials, AI can ensure that information hasn’t been tampered with and originates from a trusted source.</p>  <p>Reputation Frameworks: Identity systems could incorporate reputation mechanisms, helping AI prioritize information from sources that consistently meet a trust threshold.</p>  <p>Chain of Custody: AI could provide transparency on how information was received and processed, ensuring that its recommendations are based on data with verifiable origins.</p>  <p>The Path to Trusted AI</p><p>Trustworthy AI isn’t about making machines socially aware; it’s about ensuring that humans can trust the chain of custody behind AI-generated insights. When AI states that "Brad recommends this action," it should be able to prove that the recommendation came from the right "Brad"—the person you trust, not an imposter or manipulated data source.</p><p>The real question is: How do we create systems where AI is not just technically accurate but verifiably trustworthy? In an era where decisions increasingly rely on AI advice, embedding identity systems at the core isn’t just beneficial—it’s fundamental.</p>

<p>In the 1960s, when programming moved from punchcards (where a programmer had to laboriously make holes in physical cards to write code character by character) to keyboards with terminals, programming became easier. And that made it a better time than before to begin programming. Yet it was in this era that Nobel laureate Herb Simon wrote the words quoted in the first paragraph. Today’s arguments not to learn to code continue to echo his comment.</p>

   TIL: Styling an HTML dialog modal to take the full height of the viewport 
I spent some time today trying to figure out how to have a modal &lt;dialog&gt; element present as a full height side panel that animates in from the side. The full height bit was hard, until Natalie helped me figure out that browsers apply a default max-height: calc(100% - 6px - 2em); rule which needs to be over-ridden.

Mark Gurman reports on some leaked details from internal Apple meetings concerning the delays in shipping personalized Siri. This note in particular stood out to me:<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Walker said the decision to delay the features was made because of quality issues and that the company has found the technology only works properly up to two-thirds to 80% of the time. He said the group “can make more progress to get those percentages up, so that users get something they can really count on.” [...]</p>
<p>But Apple wants to maintain a high bar and only deliver the features when they’re polished, he said. “These are not quite ready to go to the general public, even though our competitors might have launched them in this state or worse.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I imagine it's a lot harder to get reliable results out of small, local LLMs that run on an iPhone. Features that fail 1/3 to 1/5 of the time are unacceptable for a consumer product like this.

  <p><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/using-ai-responsibly-for-reporting">How ProPublica Uses AI Responsibly in Its Investigations</a></p>
Charles Ornstein describes how ProPublic used an LLM to help analyze data for their recent story <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/ted-cruz-woke-grants-national-science-foundation">A Study of Mint Plants. A Device to Stop Bleeding. This Is the Scientific Research Ted Cruz Calls “Woke.”</a> by Agnel Philip and Lisa Song.<p></p>
<p>They ran ~3,400 grant descriptions through a prompt that included the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As an investigative journalist, I am looking for the following information</p>
<p>-- </p>
<p><code>woke_description</code>: A short description (at maximum a paragraph) on why this grant is being singled out for promoting "woke" ideology, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) or advanced neo-Marxist class warfare propaganda. Leave this blank if it's unclear.</p>
<p><code>why_flagged</code>: Look at the "STATUS", "SOCIAL JUSTICE CATEGORY", "RACE CATEGORY", "GENDER CATEGORY" and "ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE CATEGORY" fields. If it's filled out, it means that the author of this document believed the grant was promoting DEI ideology in that way. Analyze the "AWARD DESCRIPTIONS" field and see if you can figure out why the author may have flagged it in this way. Write it in a way that is thorough and easy to understand with only one description per type and award.</p>
<p><code>citation_for_flag</code>: Extract a very concise text quoting the passage of "AWARDS DESCRIPTIONS" that backs up the "why_flagged" data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was only the first step in the analysis of the data:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of course, members of our staff reviewed and confirmed every detail before we published our story, and we called all the named people and agencies seeking comment, which remains a must-do even in the world of AI.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think journalists are particularly well positioned to take advantage of LLMs in this way, because a big part of journalism is about deriving the truth from multiple unreliable sources of information. Journalists are deeply familiar with fact-checking, which is a critical skill if you're going to report with the assistance of these powerful but unreliable models.</p>
<p>Agnel Philip:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The tech holds a ton of promise in lead generation and pointing us in the right direction. But in my experience, it still needs a lot of human supervision and vetting. If used correctly, it can both really speed up the process of understanding large sets of information, and if you’re creative with your prompts and critically read the output, it can help uncover things that you may not have thought of.</p>
</blockquote>

John Gruber's blazing takedown of Apple's failure to ship many of the key Apple Intelligence features they've been actively promoting for the past twelve months.<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fiasco here is not that Apple is late on AI. It's also not that they had to announce an embarrassing delay on promised features last week. Those are problems, not fiascos, and problems happen. They're inevitable. [...] The fiasco is that Apple pitched a story that wasn't true, one that some people within the company surely understood wasn't true, and they set a course based on that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>John divides the Apple Intelligence features into the ones that were demonstrated to members of the press (including himself) at various events over the past year compared to things like "personalized Siri" that were only ever shown as concept videos. The ones that were demonstrated have all shipped. The concept video features are <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/8/delaying-personalized-siri/">indeterminably delayed</a>.

<p>Which is why the Web is still for writers. All writers. <a href="https://cluetrain.com/book/longing.html">The Longing</a>&nbsp;is a chapter by David Weinberger in The Cluetrain Manifesto that explains what the Web was for 25 years ago, and is still for today&nbsp; As <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/03/13/132830.html">Dave (Winer, not Weinberger) says</a>, the Web was meant for writers, even though the earliest of those were high-energy physicists looking to share documents between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN">CERN</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SLAC_National_Accelerator_Laboratory">SLAC</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weizmann_Institute_of_Science">the Weizmann Institute</a>. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Kunz">Paul Kunz</a> told me that.) Hell, scientists are writers too. I started writing for the Web in the early ’90s before I could even get on it. <a href="https://searls.com/time2grow.html">Here is one piece</a> I wrote in 1992, in ancient HTML, wishing I had a website to put it on. No publisher was hiring me back then. Or, come to think of it, now.</p>
<p>Same goes for The Internet. And The Net. The Web is the Web, not “the web”. We—the writers of the networked world—gave something up when we allowed the bishops of at AP and the Chicago Manual of Style to demote the Web from proper noun to lower-case status, down there with television and radio. Nobody invented “the television,” or “the radio.” Not even “the newspaper.” But somebody—Sir Tim Berners-Lee—invented the World Wide Web, and named it with upper case letters. The WWW was not the www. Is it too late to bring the Web back as a proper noun? I don’t know. I do know that I’m never going to demote it in my own writing.</p>

Says its Facebook post, “The rise of digital platforms and social media has changed the way audiences consume content, leading to declining traditional radio listenership. Coupled with rising music royalty costs, a shrinking media sales force, and decreasing profit margins, we have reached a point where it is no longer viable to continue broadcasting.”</p>

<p>They call it a blood moon, because it looks like this:</p>
<p></p>
<p>But that came later.</p>
<p>Right now still in the evening of March 13th in the Eastern time zone, the Moon is as full as it can get without moving into the shadow of Earth . Which it will. Shortly. Here is where Earth’s shadow is right now, as I write this, at around 10 PM Eastern Time:</p>
<p></p>
<p>The outer circle is Earth’s partial shadow. The inner circle is its complete shadow.</p>
<p>Here is how the Moon will look when it moves between one and the other:</p>
<p></p>
<p>And here is a close-up of how it will look when it is completely in the shadow, at about 3 AM, Eastern Time:</p>
<p></p>
<p>And this is how Earth and the Sun will look from the Moon at that time:</p>
<p></p>
<p>And if you zoom in on Earth, what you will see is a red ring, which is one round sunset circling the whole planet, and night across everything between:</p>
<p></p>
<p>I grabbed all these images from a program called Starry Night Pro Plus 7. I’ve had versions of <a href="https://www.starrynight.com/">Starry Night</a> since my 28-year-old son was a toddler. For years we would sit out on our deck every night using Starry Night as a small rectangular planetarium. So hats off to the makers for keeping it going so long.</p>

<p>Update at 3:17am, March 14…</p>
<p>A few minutes ago, at 3 AM, when the Moon has traveled into Earth’s shadow, here is what I saw:</p>

<p>Or, more correctly, what my Sony A7iv saw through its FE 70-200 mm F2.8 GM OSS II lens. Cropped, it looks like what I just put at the top of the post.</p>

  <p>The <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon">/colophon</a> page on my <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/">tools.simonwillison.net</a> site lists all 78 of the HTML+JavaScript tools I've built (with <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-assisted-programming/">AI assistance</a>) along with their commit histories, including links to prompting transcripts. I wrote about <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/11/using-llms-for-code/#a-detailed-example">how I built that colophon</a> the other day. It now also includes a description of each tool, generated using Claude 3.7 Sonnet.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is the single largest chunk of AI-generated text I've ever published on the indexable web. I share lots of LLM transcripts but I usually put them in a secret Gist such that they'll be kept out of search engines.</p>
<p>On the one hand this feels <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/slop/">slop adjacent</a> - but I was never going to write documentation for all 78 of those little experiments, yet I find myself forgetting details of how they worked. Just one example: my <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon#csv-marker-map.html">CSV marker map</a> tool which I built last year for knocking out an <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/csv-marker-map?center=39.061909385087624%2C-96.50390625000001&amp;zoom=5&amp;csv=https%3A%2F%2Fgist.githubusercontent.com%2Fsimonw%2Fdb5c00b61abb61847ece2480d96e96d2%2Fraw%2Fb76475d9f25dec235b89822ed54f9f1b84394df3%2Fsightings.csv">ad-hoc Bigfoot sightings map</a> and then promptly forgot what it could do.</p>
<p>Here's what I got when I ran:</p>
 <code>cat csv-marker-map.html | llm -m claude-3.7-sonnet \
  --system "Write a paragraph of documentation for this page as markdown. Do not include a heading. Do not use words like just or simply."
</code> 
<blockquote>
<p>This interactive map displays markers based on data from a CSV file. Load data by adding <code>?csv=URL</code> to the page URL, where the CSV must include <code>latitude</code> and <code>longitude</code> columns. You can customize the map with several URL parameters: <code>center</code> (coordinates in format <code>lat,lng</code>), <code>zoom</code> (zoom level), <code>q</code> (location to search for), <code>marker</code> (add individual markers at coordinates), and <code>color</code> (change the default marker color). The map automatically updates the URL as you navigate, preserving your current view. Markers from CSV files appear as small colored circles on the map, while markers specified directly in the URL use the default Leaflet marker style.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's genuinely useful. I <a href="https://claude.ai/share/6a07415a-6f72-4e79-90c2-7dc780d60a0d">got Claude</a> to write me a <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/write_docs.py">write_docs.py</a> script to loop through all 78 files and generate <code>filename.docs.md</code> descriptions that live in the repo, then <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/blame/5322f55a2e7006541e80a5ffe13aeb89c74c6cef/build_colophon.py#L195-L213">updated build_colophon.py</a> to include those descriptions if they exist.</p>
<p>It cost about $1.08 in Claude credits to document all 78 tools, because some of those HTML files were quite long so the input tokens added up.</p>
<p>Each of the documentation files includes a comment with the most recent commit hash of the file that was used to generate the document, like this:</p>
 <code>&lt;!-- Generated from commit: 7c6af8eeabc7682b5f9ec2621e34bc771c5471d8 --&gt;
</code> 
<p>The script can use this to spot if a tool has been updated - if so, the documentation will be regenerated.</p>
<p>Add this all together and now I can drop new HTML+JavaScript tools into my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools">simonw/tools</a> repo and, moments later, they'll be published on <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/">tools.simonwillison.net</a> with auto-generated descriptions added to my <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon">colophon</a>. I think that's pretty neat!</p>
<p>Update: I decided that the descriptions were too long, so I modified the script to add "Keep it to 2-3 sentences" to the end of the system prompt. These new, shorter descriptions are now live - <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/commit/b9eadb0255e269d865ec1ba3c385760cac7b15b7">here's the diff</a>. Total usage was 283,528 input tokens and 6,010 output tokens for a cost of 94 cents.</p>
<p>The new, shorter description for <code>csv-marker-map.html</code> looks like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This page creates an interactive map with markers based on CSV data. It accepts parameters in the URL to set the center, zoom level, search query, individual markers, and a CSV file URL for bulk marker placement. The markers are displayed on an OpenStreetMap base layer, and the map view automatically updates the URL when panned or zoomed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For comparison, here's a copy of <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/colophon-longer-descriptions.html">the previous colophon</a> with the longer descriptions.</p>

    One of the most essential practices for maintaining the long-term quality of computer code is to write automated tests that ensure the program continues to act as expected, even when other people (including your future self) muck with it.

Xata are a hosted PostgreSQL company who also develop the open source pgroll and pgstream schema migration tools. 
 Their new "Agent" tool is a system that helps monitor and optimize a PostgreSQL server using prompts to LLMs. 
 Any time I see a new tool like this I go hunting for the prompts. It looks like the main system prompts for orchestrating the tool live here - here's a sample:

<p><code>Provide clear, concise, and accurate responses to questions.

When asked to run a playbook, use the getPlaybook tool to get the playbook contents. Then use the contents of the playbook

<p>The really interesting thing is those playbooks, each of which is implemented as a prompt in the <a href="https://github.com/xataio/agent/blob/69329cede85d4bc920558c019df51f111cc5068d/apps/dbagent/src/lib/tools/playbooks.ts">lib/tools/playbooks.ts</a> file. There are six of these so far:</p>

 <code>INVESTIGATE_HIGH_CONNECTION_COUNT_PLAYBOOK</code> 
 <code>INVESTIGATE_LOW_MEMORY_PLAYBOOK</code> 
 
<p>Here's the full text of <code>INVESTIGATE_LOW_MEMORY_PLAYBOOK</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
 <code>Objective:
To investigate and resolve low freeable memory in the PostgreSQL database.

Step 1:
Get the freeable memory metric using the tool getInstanceMetric.

Step 3:
Get the instance details and compare the freeable memory with the amount of memory available.

Step 4:
Check the logs for any indications of memory pressure or out of memory errors. If there are, make sure to report that to the user. Also this would mean that the situation is critical.

Step 4:
Check active queries. Use the tool getConnectionsGroups to get the currently active queries. If a user or application stands out for doing a lot of work, record that to indicate to the user.

Step 5:
Check the work_mem setting and shared_buffers setting. Think if it would make sense to reduce these in order to free up memory.

Step 6:
If there is no clear root cause for using memory, suggest to the user to scale up the Postgres instance. Recommend a particular instance class.
</code> 
</blockquote>
<p>This is the first time I've seen prompts arranged in a "playbooks" pattern like this. What a weird and interesting way to write software!

   Anthropic API: Text editor tool 
Anthropic released a new "tool" today for text editing. It looks similar to the tool they offered as part of their computer use beta API, and the trick they've been using for a while in both Claude Artifacts and the new Claude Code to more efficiently edit files there. 
 The new tool requires you to implement several commands: 
 
 view - to view a specified file -

  <p><a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use/text-editor-tool">Anthropic API: Text editor tool</a></p>
Anthropic released a new "tool" today for text editing. It looks similar to the tool they offered as part of their <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/computer-use#understand-anthropic-defined-tools">computer use beta API</a>, and the trick they've been using for a while in both Claude Artifacts and the new <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview">Claude Code</a> to more efficiently edit files there.<p></p>
<p>The new tool requires you to implement several commands:</p>
 
 <code>view</code> - to view a specified file - either the whole thing or a specified range 
 <code>str_replace</code> - execute an exact string match replacement on a file 
 <code>create</code> - create a new file with the specified contents 
 <code>insert</code> - insert new text after a specified line number 
 <code>undo_edit</code> - undo the last edit made to a specific file 
 
<p>Providing implementations of these commands is left as an exercise for the developer.</p>
<p>Once implemented, you can have conversations with Claude where it knows that it can request the content of existing files, make modifications to them and create new ones.</p>
<p>There's quite a lot of assembly required to start using this. I tried <a href="https://claude.ai/share/97bde411-20d4-4549-a34f-27954a5ab564">vibe coding an implementation</a> by dumping a copy of the documentation into Claude itself but I didn't get as far as a working program - it looks like I'd need to spend a bunch more time on that to get something to work, so my effort is currently abandoned.</p>
<p>This was introduced as in a post on <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/token-saving-updates">Token-saving updates on the Anthropic API</a>, which also included a simplification of their token caching API and a new <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use/token-efficient-tool-use">Token-efficient tool use (beta)</a> where sending a <code>token-efficient-tools-2025-02-19</code> beta header to Claude 3.7 Sonnet can save 14-70% of the tokens needed to define tools and schemas.

  <p><a href="https://cohere.com/blog/command-a">Introducing Command A: Max performance, minimal compute</a></p>
New LLM release from Cohere. It's interesting to see which aspects of the model they're highlighting, as an indicator of what their commercial customers value the most (highlights mine):<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Command A delivers maximum performance with minimal hardware costs when compared to leading proprietary and open-weights models, such as GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3. For private deployments, Command A excels on business-critical agentic and multilingual tasks, while being deployable on just two GPUs, compared to other models that typically require as many as 32. [...]</p>
<p>With a serving footprint of just two A100s or H100s, it requires far less compute than other comparable models on the market. This is especially important for private deployments. [...]</p>
<p>Its 256k context length (2x most leading models) can handle much longer enterprise documents. Other key features include Cohere’s advanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with verifiable citations, agentic tool use, enterprise-grade security, and strong multilingual performance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's open weights but very much not open source - the license is <a href="https://cohere.com/c4ai-cc-by-nc-license">Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial</a> and also requires adhering to their <a href="https://docs.cohere.com/docs/c4ai-acceptable-use-policy">Acceptable Use Policy</a>.</p>
<p>Cohere offer it for commercial use via "contact us" pricing or through their API. I released <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-command-r/releases/tag/0.3">llm-command-r 0.3</a> adding support for this new model, plus their smaller and faster <a href="https://cohere.com/blog/command-r7b">Command R7B</a> (released in December) and support for structured outputs via <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/schemas.html">LLM schemas</a>.</p>
<p>(I found <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-command-r/issues/8#issuecomment-2722598353">a weird bug</a> with their schema support where schemas that end in an integer output a seemingly limitless integer - in my experiments it affected Command R and the new Command A but not Command R7B.)

In an impressive feat, the Typescript team rewrote their compiler, and made it 10x faster. But why use Go for the job?

<p>This catches simple mistakes with the admin configuration that trigger exceptions that might otherwise go undetected.</p>
<p>I rarely write automated tests against my own admin sites and often feel guilty about it. I wrote <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/django/testing-django-admin-with-pytest">some notes</a> on testing it with <a href="https://pytest-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/helpers.html#fixtures">pytest-django fixtures</a> a few years ago.

<p>GOV.UK One Loginは、政府のデジタルサービス（GDS）によって提供され、キャビネットオフィスがデータ管理者として機能しています<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2025/03/6766/#easy-footnote-bottom-11-6766" title="<a href=&quot;https://signin.account.gov.uk/privacy-notice&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;>Privacy Notice</a>">11</a>。このシステムは、ユーザーの利便性向上と政府サービスへのアクセス簡素化を目的としています。</p>



 GOV.UK Login のプロトコル 



<p>GOV.UK One LoginはOpenID Connect (OIDC)<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2025/03/6766/#easy-footnote-bottom-12-6766" title="<a href=&quot;https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html&quot;>Sakimura, et al. OpenID Connect Core 1.0</a>">12</a>に準拠したサービスです<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2025/03/6766/#easy-footnote-bottom-13-6766" title="<a href=&quot;https://docs.sign-in.service.gov.uk/how-gov-uk-one-login-works/&quot;>How GOV.UK One Login works</a>">13</a>。OpenID Connectは、OAuth 2.0プロトコルの上に構築された認証レイヤーであり、OAuth 2.0を拡張して標準化された方法で認証情報を提供します。</p>



<p>具体的には、GOV.UK One Loginは以下の特徴を持っています：</p>



 
 OpenID Connect準拠: OIDCプロトコルを使用して、ユーザー認証と属性の共有を行います。 



 認証フロー: 標準的なOAuth 2.0/OIDC認証コードフローを実装しています。これには以下のステップが含まれます：
 
 <code>/authorize</code> エンドポイントへの認可リクエスト 



 認可コードの発行 



 <code>/token</code> エンドポイントでのトークン交換 



 IDトークンとアクセストークンの取得 



 <code>/userinfo</code> エンドポイントでのユーザー情報の取得 
 
 



 セキュリティ強化: JWT-secured OAuth 2.0 Authorization Request (JAR)<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2025/03/6766/#easy-footnote-bottom-14-6766" title="<a href=&quot;https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9101/&quot;>Sakimura, et al. JWT-secured OAuth 2.0 Authorization Request (JAR) (RFC9101)</a>">14</a>を使用して、認証リクエストパラメータのセキュリティを向上させています。 
 



<p>ちなみにですが、OpenID Connect も JAR もわたしが主著者なので、なんとも喜ばしいことです。</p>

  <p>Google's Gemma team released an impressive new model today (under their not-open-source <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemma/terms">Gemma license</a>). Gemma 3 comes in four sizes - 1B, 4B, 12B, and 27B - and while 1B is text-only the larger three models are all multi-modal for vision:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gemma 3 introduces multimodality, supporting vision-language input and text outputs. It handles context windows up to 128k tokens, understands over 140 languages, and offers improved math, reasoning, and chat capabilities, including structured outputs and function calling.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's the <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/gemma/Gemma3Report.pdf">Gemma 3 Technical Report PDF</a>, which makes the big claim that they find "Gemma3-27B-IT comparable to Gemini-1.5-Pro across
benchmarks".</p>
<p>I tried out the largest model using the latest <a href="https://ollama.com/">Ollama</a> - this is the second time I've spotted a major model release partnering with Ollama on launch day, the first being <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/30/mistral-small-3/">Mistral Small 3</a>.</p>
<p>I ran this (after upgrading Ollama through their menu icon upgrade option):</p>
 <code>ollama pull gemma3:27b
</code> 
<p>That pulled 17GB of model weights. I've been trying it out using <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a> and <a href="https://github.com/taketwo/llm-ollama">llm-ollama</a>:</p>
 <code>llm install llm-ollama
llm -m gemma3:27b 'Build a single page HTML+CSS+JavaScript UI that gives me a large textarea for writing in which constantly saves what I have entered to localStorage (restoring when I reload the page) and displays a word counter'
</code> 
<p>That was a replay of <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon#word-counter.html">a prompt</a> I ran against Claude Artifacts a few months ago. Here's <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/gemma3-word-count.html">what Gemma built</a>, and the <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/f8a87f2242439d3974405a17f5d8bc23">full chat transcript</a>. It's a simple example but it worked just right.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Let's try out the vision mode, by asking it to describe this photo:</p>
<p></p>
 <code>llm -m gemma3:27b describe -a https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/two-pelicans.jpg
</code> 
<p>Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/0e703ba72d0cf5a6dd117981bd03e604">the full response</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Overall Impression:</p>
<p>The image features two brown pelicans in flight against a solid, bright blue background. The composition is dynamic, capturing the birds mid-wingbeat.</p>
<p>Details:</p>
 
 
Pelicans: Both pelicans are a rich, dark brown color. They have large, pale yellow-orange beaks and pouches. One pelican is shown with its wings fully extended, appearing to be gliding or soaring. The other is captured with its wings in a more dynamic, upward-sweeping motion. 
 
Background: The background is a flat, uniform shade of bright blue, which makes the pelicans stand out. 
 
Composition: The birds are positioned in opposite directions, creating a sense of movement and balance. The image is well-lit, highlighting the texture of the pelicans' feathers. 
 
<p>Overall, the image is a striking and visually appealing depiction of these majestic birds in flight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is it right to say "the birds are positioned in opposite directions"? I thought that was a mistake at first, but I'll give it a pass since their wings are positioned in opposite directions to each other.</p>

<p>Something I've been curious about recently is longer context support: how well can a local model on my laptop deal with summarization or data extraction tasks against longer pieces of text?</p>
<p>I decided to try <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/llms/claude-hacker-news-themes#user-content-adding-a--m-model-option">my Hacker News summarize script</a> using Gemma, against <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43340491">the thread</a> there discussing the Gemma 3 technical paper.</p>
<p>First I did a quick token count (using the OpenAI tokenizer but it's usually a similar number to other models):</p>
 <code>curl 'https://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/items/43340491' | ttok
</code> 
<p>This returned 22,260 - well within Gemma's documented limits but still a healthy number considering just last year most models topped out at 4,000 or 8,000.</p>
<p>I ran my script like this:</p>
 <code>hn-summary.sh 43340491 -m gemma3:27b
</code> 
<p>It did a pretty good job! Here's the <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/ab487ea3d1605e719dc2950cd4565146">full prompt and response</a>. The one big miss is that it ignored my instructions to include illustrative quotes - I don't know if modifying the prompt will fix that but it's disappointing that it didn't handle that well, given how important direct quotes are for building confidence in RAG-style responses.</p>
<p>Here's what I got for <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/f79c4bd2fbe966e1b600cb8b41cae810">Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle</a>:</p>
 <code>llm -m gemma3:27b 'Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle'
</code> 

<p></p>

<p>You can also try out the new Gemma <a href="https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat?model=gemma-3-27b-it">in Google AI Studio</a>, and via their API. I added support for it to <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-gemini/releases/tag/0.15">llm-gemini 0.15</a>, though sadly it appears vision mode doesn't work with that API hosted model yet.</p>
 <code>llm install -U llm-gemini
llm keys set gemini
# paste key here
llm -m gemma-3-27b-it 'five facts about pelicans of interest to skunks'
</code> 
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/bc22062e60e5af3faf458756cb368d0e">Here's what I got</a>. I'm not sure how pricing works for that hosted model.</p>
<p>Gemma 3 is also already available <a href="https://github.com/Blaizzy/mlx-vlm/pull/235">through MLX-VLM</a> - here's <a href="https://huggingface.co/collections/mlx-community/gemma-3-67d14a10480a436ad478b0f9">the MLX model collection</a> - but I haven't tried that version yet.</p>

See the episode transcript at the top of this page, and a summary at the bottom.</p> Brought to You By   <p><a href="https://sentry.io/pragmatic/?">Sentry</a> — Error and performance monitoring for developers.</p>  <p><a href="https://engguidebook.com/#buy">The Software Engineer’s Guidebook</a>: Written by me (Gergely) – now out in audio form as well.</p>  <p>—</p> In This Episode <p>In today’s episode of The Pragmatic Engineer, I am joined by former Uber colleague, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gautamkorlam/">Gautam Korlam</a>. Gautam is the Co-Founder of <a href="https://gitar.ai/">Gitar</a>, an agentic AI startup that automates code maintenance. Gautam was mobile engineer no. 9 at Uber and founding engineer for the mobile platform team – and so he learned a few things about scaling up engineering teams.</p><p>We talk about:</p><p>• How Gautam accidentally deleted Uber’s Java monorepo – really!</p><p>• Uber's unique engineering stack and why custom solutions like SubmitQueue were built in-house</p><p>• Monorepo: the benefits and downsides of this approach</p><p>• From Engineer II to Principal Engineer at Uber: Gautam’s career trajectory</p><p>• Practical strategies for building trust and gaining social capital</p><p>• How the platform team at Uber operated with a product-focused mindset</p><p>• Vibe coding: why it helps with quick prototyping</p><p>• How AI tools are changing developer experience and productivity</p><p>• Important skills for devs to pick up to remain valuable as AI tools spread</p><p>• And more!</p>     Takeaways <p>Interesting parts of the conversation:</p><p>1. Submit Queue: Uber built a complex merge system to deal with the large number of commits, where each commit had to run long-running CI tests. It’s a problem that smaller and mid-sized companies don’t have, but Uber had: and so they scratched their own itch.</p><p>2. Local Developer Analytics (LDA): years ago, Uber started to measure the experience that devs had. Things like: how long did a build take, locally? How much CPU is used? They used this data to improve internal tooling.</p><p>3. Developer experience as a product team.

AI changing software development: this is happening. “Vibe coding” leads to faster prototyping.

Back then, there were not even unit tests. Gautam wrote the first Android test, and set up Artifactory.</p>  <p>Uber built much of its engineering stack in-house because the cloud-native SaaS products were not built for their scale.</p>  <p>Even in the earlier years, Uber saw about one commit every minute – and the platforms at the time could not handle this (especially when considering that CI took 10-30 minutes to run!)</p>  <p>Build time was a problem. During the iOS and Android app rewrite in 2016, build times became very long. Gautam worked on getting it under control.</p>  <p>Submit Queue was a way to guarantee a green main. It serialised incoming commits to ensure they played nicely together. The company <a href="https://kagi.com/search?q=uber+submitqueue">published a paper</a> on this novel solution. Submit Queue tested changes and considered cross-dependencies between different commits. Machine learning models estimated potential failures and speculatively tried paths that might be green.</p>    <p>Monorepo: after starting as polyrepos, Uber moved to monorepos</p>  <p>Uber started with separate repos for Rider, Driver, and other apps (eg Eats). As the company grew, each team wanted its own repository, resulting in hundreds of repos. It became painful to upgrade and bump libraries.</p>  <p>The iOS team moved to a monorepo, followed by Android. The gains in productivity were massive because there was no need to bump libraries. This move really helped with standardisation.</p>  <p>The biggest initial pushback was that teams could no longer break an API without worrying about the consequences. There was concern about slower builds. In the end, the dev platform team solved these concerns.</p>     Developer experience and dev productivity   <p>Local Developer Analytics (LDA): an internal Uber system that ran on developers' machines and collected information about their systems. It integrated deeply into CLI tools and IDEs, tracked which files developers accessed most, and identified files with the most bugs. LDA helped identify bottlenecks in the development funnel.</p>  <p>Developer surveys: Uber ran these regularly. The dev tooling NPS went from negative 50 to positive 8 during Gautam’s tenure.</p>  <p>Things that made for a better developer experience: minimizing time to review code, time to build code, and reducing time spent in meetings.</p>    <p>DevPods: another internal Uber tool. These are basically cloud developer environments. They contain a container of code, build system artefacts and IDE indices in the cloud. DevPods make context switching quick.</p>  <p>Previously, onboarding involved running a bootstrapping script. The script was hard to maintain. Dev Pods moved the development stuff into a container. The containers can be huge.</p>     Career growth to Principal Engineer   <p>Going deep: getting into a niche and going deep can help over the long term, especially in areas others may not want to do.</p>  <p>Introspect regularly:&nbsp;Every two years, Gautam did some introspection to see if he was doing what he wanted and what could challenge him more.</p>  <p>Social capital and mentorship: these become very important at a big company. It helps to have connections. Helping people builds social capital. Gautam would drop everything to help people with their dev environment problems. He also held office hours on a regular basis, offering to help anyone who showed up.</p>  <p>Understand the business: Principal engineers need to understanding how engineering meets business, rather than just pure coding. It helps if you enjoy diving into this area – as well as if you like talking with people!</p>  <p>More of a peer relationship with your manager. As engineers grow in seniority, they become more like a peer to their manager and help their manager get stuff done. The relationship is more like a “peer” than a “boss”.</p>  <p>Tip for managers of senior+ devs: give them agency, check in often, and make sure they are unblocked.</p>     The impact of AI on software development   <p>Autocomplete: an obvious use case. It helps one type less and think more.</p>  <p>“Vibe coding”: AI allows you to explore more paths and experiment faster.</p>  <p>How AI impacts engineers</p>  <p>Controversial, but Gauam believes that junior engineers are going to thrive because they are coming up with new knowledge and new ways of working with AI tools. They do not have the biases of working a particular way.</p>  <p>The “generalist engineer” is going to be more in-demand, looking ahead</p>  <p>CS knowledge remains important.</p>  <p>When things go wrong, it is important to understand why they went wrong. This requires strong computer science fundamentals and system knowledge.</p>       <p>Where to find Gautam Korlam:</p><p>• X: <a href="https://x.com/kageiit">https://x.com/kageiit</a></p><p>• LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gautamkorlam/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/gautamkorlam/</a></p><p>Mentions during the episode:</p><p>• Bypassing Large Diffs in SubmitQueue: <a href="https://www.uber.com/blog/bypassing-large-diffs-in-submitqueue/">https://www.uber.com/blog/bypassing-large-diffs-in-submitqueue/</a></p><p>• Jenkins: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenkins_(software)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenkins_(software)</a></p><p>• Devpods: <a href="https://www.uber.com/blog/devpod-improving-developer-productivity-at-uber/">https://www.uber.com/blog/devpod-improving-developer-productivity-at-uber/</a></p><p>• JetBrains: <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/">https://www.jetbrains.com/</a></p><p>• Cloud Development Environments: <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/cloud-development-environments">https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/cloud-development-environments</a></p><p>• Why are Cloud Development Environments Spiking in Popularity, Now?: <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/why-are-cloud-development-environments-spiking-in-popularity-now/">https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/why-are-cloud-development-environments-spiking-in-popularity-now/</a></p><p>• “The Coding Machine” at Meta with Michael Novati: <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-coding-machine-at-meta">https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-coding-machine-at-meta</a></p><p>• Software Architect Archetypes: <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/software-architect-archetypes">https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/software-architect-archetypes</a></p><p>• The Platform and Program Split at Uber: A Milestone Special: <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-platform-and-program-split-at">https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-platform-and-program-split-at</a></p><p>• What is Vibe Coding?

What too few remember, or respect, is The Doors' melodies. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUN03rwFYBs">Wintertime Love</a>, for example, is a sweet waltz. Dig around the oeuvre.

  <p><a href="https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/">OpenAI Agents SDK</a></p>
OpenAI's other big announcement today (<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/11/responses-vs-chat-completions/">see also</a>) - a Python library (<a href="https://pypi.org/project/openai-agents/">openai-agents</a>) for building "agents", which is a replacement for their previous <a href="https://github.com/openai/swarm">swarm</a> research project.<p></p>
<p>In this project, an "agent" is a class that configures an LLM with a system prompt an access to specific tools.</p>
<p>An interesting concept in this one is the concept of <a href="https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/handoffs/">handoffs</a>, where one agent can chose to hand execution over to a different system-prompt-plus-tools agent treating it almost like a tool itself. This code example illustrates the idea:</p>
 from agents import Agent, handoff

billing_agent = Agent(
    name="Billing agent"
)
refund_agent = Agent(
    name="Refund agent"
)
triage_agent = Agent(
    name="Triage agent",
    handoffs=[billing_agent, handoff(refund_agent)]
) 

<p>The library also includes <a href="https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/guardrails/">guardrails</a> - classes you can add that attempt to filter user input to make sure it fits expected criteria. Bits of this look suspiciously like trying to <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Sep/17/prompt-injection-more-ai/">solve AI security problems with more AI</a> to me.

   OpenAI API: Responses vs. Chat Completions 
OpenAI released a bunch of new API platform features this morning under the headline "New tools for building agents" (their somewhat mushy interpretation of "agents" here is "systems that independently accomplish tasks on behalf of users").

  <p><a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/responses-vs-chat-completions">OpenAI API: Responses vs. Chat Completions</a></p>
OpenAI released a bunch of new API platform features this morning under the headline "<a href="https://openai.com/index/new-tools-for-building-agents/">New tools for building agents</a>" (their somewhat mushy interpretation of "agents" here is "systems that independently accomplish tasks on behalf of users").<p></p>
<p>A particularly significant change is the introduction of a new Responses API, which is a slightly different shape from the Chat Completions API that they've offered for the past couple of years and which others in the industry have widely cloned as an ad-hoc standard.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/responses-vs-chat-completions">this guide</a> they illustrate the differences, with a reassuring note that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Chat Completions API is an industry standard for building AI applications, and we intend to continue supporting this API indefinitely. We're introducing the Responses API to simplify workflows involving tool use, code execution, and state management. We believe this new API primitive will allow us to more effectively enhance the OpenAI platform into the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An API that is going away is the <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/assistants">Assistants API</a>, a perpetual beta first launched at OpenAI DevDay in 2023. The new responses API solves effectively the same problems but better, and assistants will be sunset "in the first half of 2026".</p>
<p>The best illustration I've seen of the differences between the two is this <a href="https://github.com/openai/openai-python/commit/2954945ecc185259cfd7cd33c8cbc818a88e4e1b">giant commit</a> to the <code>openai-python</code> GitHub repository updating ALL of the example code in one go.</p>
<p>The most important feature of the Responses API (a feature it shares with the old Assistants API) is that it can manage conversation state on the server for you. An oddity of the Chat Completions API is that you need to maintain your own records of the current conversation, sending back full copies of it with each new prompt. You end up making API calls that look like this (from <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/conversation-state?api-mode=chat&amp;lang=javascript#manually-manage-conversation-state">their examples</a>):</p>
  {
    "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "knock knock.",
        },
        {
            "role": "assistant",
            "content": "Who's there?",
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Orange."
        }
    ]
}  

<p>These can get long and unwieldy - especially when attachments such as images are involved - but the real challenge is when you start integrating tools: in a conversation with tool use you'll need to maintain that full state and drop messages in that show the output of the tools the model requested. It's not a trivial thing to work with.</p>
<p>The new Responses API continues to support this list of messages format, but you also get the option to outsource that to OpenAI entirely: you can add a new <code>"store": true</code> property and then in subsequent messages include a <code>"previous_response_id: response_id</code> key to continue that conversation.</p>
<p>This feels a whole lot more natural than the Assistants API, which required you to think in terms of <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview#objects">threads, messages and runs</a> to achieve the same effect.</p>
<p>Also fun: the Response API <a href="https://twitter.com/athyuttamre/status/1899541484308971822">supports HTML form encoding</a> now in addition to JSON:</p>
 <code>curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \
  -u :$OPENAI_API_KEY \
  -d model="gpt-4o" \

<p>I found that in an excellent <a href="https://twitter.com/athyuttamre/status/1899541471532867821">Twitter thread</a> providing background on the design decisions in the new API from OpenAI's Atty Eleti. Here's <a href="https://nitter.net/athyuttamre/status/1899541471532867821">a nitter link</a> for people who don't have a Twitter account.</p>
 New built-in tools 
<p>A potentially more exciting change today is the introduction of default tools that you can request while using the new Responses API. There are three of these, all of which can be specified in the <code>"tools": [...]</code> array.</p>
 
 <code>{"type": "web_search_preview"}</code> - the same search feature available through ChatGPT. The documentation doesn't clarify which underlying search engine is used - I initially assumed Bing, but the tool documentation links to this <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/bots">Overview of OpenAI Crawlers</a> page so maybe it's entirely in-house now? Web search <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/pricing#web-search">is priced</a> at between $25 and $50 per thousand queries depending on if you're using GPT-4o or GPT-4o mini and the configurable size of your "search context". 
 <code>{"type": "file_search", "vector_store_ids": [...]}</code> provides integration with the latest version of their <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-file-search">file search</a> vector store, mainly used for RAG. "Usage is priced⁠ at $2.50 per thousand queries and file storage at $0.10/GB/day, with the first GB free". 
 <code>{"type": "computer_use_preview", "display_width": 1024, "display_height": 768, "environment": "browser"}</code> is the most surprising to me: it's tool access to the <a href="https://openai.com/index/computer-using-agent/">Computer-Using Agent</a> system they built for their Operator product. This one is going to be a lot of fun to explore. The tool's documentation includes a warning <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-computer-use#beware-of-prompt-injections">about prompt injection risks</a>. Though on closer inspection I think this may work more like <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/22/computer-use/">Claude Computer Use</a>, where you have to <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-computer-use#setting-up-your-environment">run the sandboxed environment yourself</a> rather than outsource that difficult part to them. 
 
<p>I'm still thinking through how to expose these new features in my <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a> tool, which is made harder by the fact that a number of plugins now rely on the default OpenAI implementation from core, which is currently built on top of Chat Completions. I've been worrying for a while about the impact of our entire industry building clones of one proprietary API that might change in the future, I guess now we get to see how that shakes out!

<p>Imagine you’re the cofounder of a startup hiring its first few software engineers, and there’s a candidate who smashes the technical interview, and is the only one to complete the full coding interview – doing so with time to spare. Their communication style is a bit unconventional, but this could be explained by language differences, and isn’t a red flag. So, the promising candidate gets a thumbs up, and pretty soon they’re on screen in a non-technical final interview with the other cofounder, via video.</p><p>Then things get weird. Your cofounder pings you mid-interview to report that the candidate from Poland speaks no Polish whatsoever, and also that there is something just not right about their appearance on screen. The recruitment of this candidate gets derailed by suspicious details which erode everyone’s confidence in making the hire. Soon afterwards, the same thing happens again with another candidate.</p><p>Later, you discover that two imposters hiding behind deepfake avatars almost succeeded in tricking your startup into hiring them. This may sound like the stuff of fiction, but it really did happen to a startup called <a href="https://www.vidocsecurity.com/">Vidoc Security</a>, recently. Fortunately, they caught the AI impostors – and the second time it happened they got video evidence.</p><p>To find out more about this unsettling, fascinating episode from the intersection of cutting-edge AI and tech recruitment, the Pragmatic Engineer sat down with Vidoc cofounder, Dawid Moczadło. Today, we cover:</p>  <p>The first AI faker. Vidoc Security nearly made an offer to a fake candidate, but their back story raised too many questions.</p>  <p>The second AI faker. The next time a job candidate raised similar suspicions, the team was prepared and confronted the faker during the call – and recorded it.</p>  <p>How to avoid being tricked by AI candidates. Take the risk seriously, have applicants turn off video filters and verify that they do this, record interviews, and get firm proof of identity before any offer.</p>  <p>Foreign state interference? There’s evidence that many AI candidates could be part of a coordinated governmental operation targeting hundreds of western tech businesses. Full-remote workplaces are the most targeted.</p>  <p>Return of in-person final rounds? This looks an obvious consequence of these incidents.</p>  <p>New AI risks for tech businesses. Remote interviews may have to change, while devs also risk introducing security vulnerabilities by accepting AI suggestions without critique.</p>  <p>Hiring funnel. The story began with <a href="https://justjoin.it/job-offer/vidoc-security-lab-founding-backend-engineer---mid-senior-warszawa-javascript">this job posting</a> for a backend engineer. The startup shares its hiring funnel, giving a sense of how competitive full-remote startup positions are, currently. As context: from 500 applications, two hires have been made – and Vidoc is <a href="https://justjoin.it/job-offer/vidoc-security-lab-founding-backend-engineer---mid-senior-warszawa-javascript">still actively recruiting</a> for this position.</p>   <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff4184d0d-b473-4aeb-999c-e60dbd80396f_1600x750.png">          </a>Catching an AI imposter: the candidate (left) refused to place their hand in front of their face because it would blow their AI cover.

The first AI faker <p>Vidoc Security is a security provider offering automated code reviews to detect security issues. The idea for the company came from two security engineers and ethical hackers, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dawid-moczadlo/">Dawid Moczadło</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/klaudia-kloc-/">Klaudia Kloc</a>. Previously, they hacked top tech companies like Meta and then disclosed vulnerabilities to those places in order to collect bounties, and get on those companies’ ethical hacking leaderboards.</p><p>With the rise of LLMs in the past couple of years, Dawid and Klaudia spotted an opportunity to create a tool that works in the same way as they searched for security vulnerabilities: looking across the broader codebase, checking how components interact, which parts could be insecure, and more. Basically, an LLM can take their expertise about what works to hack well-designed systems, and build a tool with some of the same know-how.</p><p>Their idea attracted investors, and Dawid and Klaudia raised a $600K seed round in 2023, and a further $2.5M in seed funding in August 2024. With this seed funding in the bank: the company began hiring. They posted <a href="https://justjoin.it/job-offer/vidoc-security-lab-founding-backend-engineer---mid-senior-warszawa-javascript">a job ad</a> for a backend engineer, and started to interview candidates. (We share details on the exact hiring funnel and statistics below, in “The hiring funnel”)</p><p>One promising candidate was called Makary Krol. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/makary-krol-336923317/">His LinkedIn profile</a> is still active:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F62e47648-a4a7-4798-a498-bd89c59c25f7_1272x1552.png">          </a>Fake profile. Source: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/makary-krol-336923317/">LinkedIn</a> <p>Below is a step-by-step summary of how the recruitment process for the imposter candidate went, based on Vidoc Security's records, including the bogus resume. By the end of step 5, the team were certain they were the target of a scam.</p><p>1. Resume screening: ✅Resume looks solid:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbbb86dbc-8345-4c3f-b198-c38450d6a587_1260x1512.png">          </a>Page 1 of 2 from the fake resume. The resume looked convincing  <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe58fc44e-cebe-400b-a05a-075a1e01f73a_1206x1012.png">          </a>Page 2 of 2 of the fake, but convincing resume <p>2. First-round screening. ✅⚠️ A 15-30 minute call with Paulina, head of operations. It was a bit odd that the candidate did not speak any Polish, but was based there and graduated from Warsaw University of Technology. He spoke in broken English, and with a very strong accent that sounded Asian, but these weren’t warning big red flags, and the candidate sounded motivated.</p><p>3. Hiring manager interview. ✅⚠️ The candidate was clearly well-rounded and a technical screening was the obvious next step. Dawid’s only “yellow flag” was that their communication skills were poor, but he figured a technical interview would be a chance to show their core coding and technical skills.</p><p>4. Technical interview. ✅✅The candidate absolutely smashed it, being the first to finish all coding tasks and follow-up questions in the allocated time of 2 hours, which hadn’t happened before. Dawid was surprised by how competent they were at coding and technical problem solving. The coding abilities of this candidate were definitely not fake: they were a seasoned, very capable engineer.</p><p>5. Final hiring manager interview. ‼️⚠️ This was a non-technical interview with cofounder, Klaudia, who dug into the specifics of their background and grew suspicious. The candidate gave some details about previous positions, but she increasingly found herself disbelieving their back story and resume, the more time she spent with the candidate. Dawid shared the suspicion and they became certain that the figure on screen was far from what they claimed to be.</p><p>By the end of the recruitment process, Vidoc believed they had nearly been played, and had come worryingly close to extending an offer to a fake candidate using a false identity in their documents, and an AI filter to mask their face on screen. However, they had no evidence of this, and didn’t record the interviews, so had only their impressions and notes.</p><p>When Dawid recounted this episode to peers, he was met with disbelief. Founder friends – along with most other people – thought the team were overreacting and misguided. Eventually, Dawid stopped sharing the story and began to doubt the team’s suspicions about the candidate.</p><p>After the incident, Vidoc added an onsite interview as a final step in the recruitment process, and held a retrospective to figure out how to avoid something similar again. Interestingly, there wasn’t much that could be done about the potential risks of remote interviews being taken by applicants pretending to be someone else.</p> 2. The second AI faker <p>Two months after the suspected fake job candidate episode, another promising applicant appeared, going by the name Bratislav Rakočević, located in Serbia, with a university education there. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bratislavrako%C4%8Devi%C4%87-c197d9200/">His LinkedIn</a> was pretty basic:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4a2dbe6-a267-4dd8-a255-120d74bd5182_1203x1600.png">          </a>Another entirely made-up profile. Source: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bratislavrako%C4%8Devi%C4%87-c197d9200/">LinkedIn</a> <p>This application looked good, so the company ran the usual recruitment process, below (including the candidate’s made-up resume):</p><p>1. Resume screening: ✅⚠️ Solid on technologies, but with too many buzzwords for their current, self-employed role. Of course, it’s not unusual that some devs don’t thrive at writing resumes. Their credentials merited a call, especially as the “candidate” had “worked” at HubSpot and Woosh:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76e0e250-ed67-43a6-b62b-b3d3ff9d7cf7_1222x1598.png">          </a>Page 1 of 2 of another resume that later turned out to be fake  <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe2e01c19-006c-4996-b754-cb5db9b033c5_1194x1600.png">          </a>Page 2 of 2 of another resume that turned out to be fake <p>2. First-round screening. ✅⚠️ Communication was a bit choppy — then again, we’re talking about a non-native English speaker. The candidate did not speak Serbian, despite graduating from the University of Kragujevac, in Serbia. Once again, they sounded motivated, so proceeded to the next round.</p><p>3. Hiring manager interview: AI filter exposed‼️‼️Dawid conducted this interview, and immediately felt that something was off about the candidate. First of all, Dawid felt the candidate on the call looked somewhat unlike their low-resolution LinkedIn profile:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7b95aaad-1265-4ed0-9a23-ea14ff7850b0_1402x780.png">          </a>First suspicion: Dawid felt the interviewee looked dissimilar to their profile picture <p>As a rule, Vidoc never records interviews, but the team had been burnt once before and had faced scepticism about it from peers afterwards. So he hit record, and asked the candidate to make a simple gesture which bamboozles the current crop of AI filters:</p><blockquote><p>“Can you take your hand and put it in front of your face and cover it partially?”</p></blockquote> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd1518cc3-4acc-4426-81ce-1921c97a2926_1104x444.gif">          </a>Candidate (on the left) declines to place hand in front of face as the interviewer requests (right) <p>The candidate refused, so Dawid ended the conversation. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/klaudia-kloc-_story-of-how-an-ai-generated-polish-politician-ugcPost-7300929611511611395-QUeq?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAIk0KwBsmE3oBadWSg2ettxmEyKbqZKG34">Watch the full video of the encounter.</a></p><p>Later, several people pointed out that the AI mask looked uncannily similar to a prominent Polish politician named Sławomir Mentzen:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c1b4a8a-2e03-43f0-ac57-696ca0547ecb_1366x800.png">          </a>Was this deepfake trained on video footage of a Polish politician? <p>Looking back on these twin incidents, the team suspects the same individual may have been behind the AI disguises of both fake candidates because:</p>  <p>Their voices sounded almost identical</p>  <p>The second candidate answered questions with surprising confidence – almost like he’d been asked them before</p>  <p>…a hunch that they had spoken before</p>  <p>The AI filter for the second faker was of much lower quality than the first. The first candidate slipped through undetected through several interviews, despite almost certainly using an AI filter as well. Dawid said the second candidate’s filter looked obvious on the screen – but on that occasion the Vidoc Security team were on high alert for any possible deception. It’s worth remembering that AI filters improve with time, so spotting a good one won’t always be easy.</p> 3. How to avoid being tricked by AI candidates <p>How can tech companies hiring engineers protect themselves, and prevent AI-disguised candidates? Some suggestions:</p><p>This is not a drill; take the threat seriously: If you think your company is too small to fall victim, think again. Vidoc Security was just a two-person startup in February 2023 with no funding raised, when it was first targeted. The first fake profile cold emailed them on LinkedIn to ask if they were hiring.</p><p>It’s possible there is a large, state-level operation running a pool of bogus applicants who hide behind fake resumes and AI filters in video interviews. If this operation can find the smallest of startups to target, it’s safe to assume they could apply to any other company, as well.</p><p>Don’t assume all job seekers on local job boards are genuine. Vidoc posted on local job boards, like the one in Poland. But whoever was behind this operation figured out that it’s profitable to pose as Serbian, Polish, and other eastern European profiles, and to apply via small, low-profile job boards. I didn’t even know about the job board “<a href="https://justjoin.it/">JustJoinIT</a>” (popular in Poland) but the fakers were already active on it.</p><p>Ask candidates to turn off all filters – including background ones. Filters that blur or replace the background are ubiquitous these days. During a video interview, it’s fair to ask a candidate to turn off all filters. After that, if there are still unusual minor details on their face or the background, then it’s safe to assume that a candidate did not turn off their filters. In an interview for a full-remote position, this could be justification enough to terminate the call.</p><p>Ask the candidate to do things that AI filters cannot handle – yet, such as:</p>  <p>A face turning side to side</p>  <p>A hand in front of a face</p>  <p>standing up and walking backward from the camera, showing more body detail</p>  <p>In the circumstances, It should be justifiable to run through some or all of these tests, as well as asking for all filters to be turned off. Stu Sjouwerman, CEO of KnowBe4, <a href="https://blog.knowbe4.com/north-korean-it-worker-threat-10-critical-updates-to-your-hiring-process">shared additional details</a> on what his company learned from hiring a North Korean worker with a false identity:</p>  <p>Do not rely on email references alone. For reference checks, also do phone calls or video calls with references.</p>  <p>Absence of a digital footprint is suspicious. If there’s no trace of a candidate anywhere online, it could be a flag.</p>  <p>Use a phone carrier lookup tool before calling a candidate. Many fake candidates provide a VoIP number. Treat any such number as a red flag and refuse to call candidates on it.</p>  <p>Conduct all interviews using video. Fake candidates can slip through written application processes more easily</p>  <p>Expect identity theft. In the case of KnowBe4, the identity of the person they hired was real and stolen, meaning that a background check came back clean.</p>  <p>Put better internal monitoring in place. Monitor access to systems by onboarded employees – and pay extra attention to new joiners.</p>  <p>When suspicious, ask lowkey “cultural” questions. For example, if a candidate claims to be from Seattle but there is reason to suspect otherwise, ask a question like, “'I see you are from Seattle, what's your favorite place to eat, and what do you usually get?” Faking this knowledge in a convincing way is hard for someone who has never been to Seattle, and doesn’t know the local cuisine.</p>  <p>Different shipping address for laptop. If a candidate asks for an onboarding laptop to be shipped to a different address from where they are supposed to be living or working, it’s a red flag.</p>  <p>Additional tips:</p>  <p>Record video interviews and save them for later. AI-disguised candidates might be hard to spot in a live scenario, but analyzing the video later could be helpful. Note that recording the interview will most likely require disclosing this to a candidate, and them agreeing to this.</p>  <p>Get notarized proof of identity. This advice <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/mitigating-dprk-it-worker-threat">comes from Google</a>, after they saw hundreds of US companies fall victim to North Korean workers by hiring them for tech roles.</p>  <p>Vidoc also created a guide to detect fake candidates in your hiring pipeline: <a href="https://www.vidocsecurity.com/ebook/ebook-detecting-fake-candidates-vsl.pdf">see this PDF document here</a>.</p> 4. Foreign state interference? <p>So, who or what might be behind these two incidents at Vidoc; a lone individual or individuals, or something else entirely? </p>

 I am thinking about what personal data could—or should—a personal AI (one a person owns and runs) be trained on? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ChatGPT said: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>If a person owned and ran their own AI, it would ideally be trained on personal data that enhances its ability to assist them in meaningful, tailored ways. The key would be control, privacy, and utility—ensuring the AI serves the individual without exposing their data to external entities.</p>
 Types of Personal Data a Personal AI Could Be Trained On 
 1. Communication &amp; Writing Style

 Highly sensitive personal identifiers (e.g., passwords, legal documents, medical records unless encrypted) 
 Private conversations without explicit consent 
 Raw biometric data (unless securely stored locally) 
 Anything the user does not have full control over 
 
 
 How Should a Personal AI Handle This Data? 
 
 Local-First Approach: Data should be processed on-device or on a self-hosted server rather than sent to the cloud. 
 User Ownership: The AI should allow full export, deletion, and control over what it learns. 
 Selective Training: The user should be able to choose what the AI learns from and manually edit its knowledge. 
 
 
 Final Thought: A Digital Reflection of You 
<p>A personal AI should be like a trusted assistant, trained on the aspects of life that enhance productivity, well-being, and creativity while ensuring absolute privacy and control.</p>
<p>Would you want such an AI to be purely reactive (answering queries) or proactive (offering insights and suggestions)?</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 You said: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 I think a personal AI should be like a personal computer: something a person has that belongs to them and can do lots of things. The defaulted Q&amp;A model, which we have at this moment in history, is too narrow. For example, I would like to see a table that lists all the streaming services to which I subscribe, when each subscription runs out, what I’m paying for it, and exactly what I’ve watched or listened to. While asking “How many seasons of ‘Reacher’ have I watched, and what service did I watch it on?” can be a way to get answers to questions, much of the time we just want a structured and general view of our data. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ChatGPT said: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>I completely agree. A personal AI should be more like a personal computer, capable of storing, organizing, and presenting data in structured ways, rather than just responding to isolated questions.</p>
<p>Your example—tracking streaming services, expiration dates, costs, and watched content—is exactly the kind of personal data intelligence that AI should enable. Instead of relying on fragmented app histories or memory, you should be able to:</p>
 
 See a structured dashboard summarizing your subscriptions. 
 Sort, filter, and edit data directly in a personal database. 
 Query it naturally when needed (“What did I last watch on Prime Video?”). 
 Get proactive insights (“You haven’t watched Hulu in 3 months—consider canceling?”). 
 
<p>This is way beyond today’s AI chatbots, but it’s exactly where personal AI should go—acting as a real tool rather than just a Q&amp;A assistant.</p>
<p>Would you want this data to live locally on your device (like a personal database) or be syncable across devices?</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 You said: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Yes, I would like the data to be local, and viewable (as well as syncable) across devices. I would also like to have access do data collected about me, to which I do not currently have access. For example, my Samsung and TCL TVs are possibly collecting lots of viewing data (presumably to sell to advertisers) that would be useful to me. Likewise, all new cars come with a cellular connection (with a phone number) that is under the control of the carmaker, rather than the driver. Both that system and the ones in my Apple and Google apps in my phone know where I’ve been and what routes I’ve taken. That information is potentially (or actually) very useful to me. Combined, for example, with schedule data, my personal AI might know who I had lunch with, when, and where, that time I was driving through Columbus on my way to New York. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ChatGPT said: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>You’re envisioning a true personal AI, one that doesn’t just respond to questions but actively manages and reveals insights from data that is rightfully yours. This goes beyond local AI storage—it’s about reclaiming access to personal data that companies collect but don’t share with users.</p>
 Key Aspects of Your Ideal AI: 
 
 Local-First Storage – All personal data is owned and controlled by you, not stored on third-party servers. 
 Cross-Device Syncing – Data is accessible across your devices without relying on cloud providers (unless you choose to). 
 Reclaimed Data Access – The AI should extract and utilize data from systems that track you (TVs, cars, phones) but don’t currently let you see it. 
 Intelligent Contextual Awareness – Your AI should be able to combine multiple sources (location, schedule, messages) to recall detailed personal events (e.g., “Who did I meet for lunch last time I was in Columbus?”). 
 
 Challenges &amp; Opportunities 
 
 TV Viewing Data: Many smart TVs (Samsung, TCL, LG) track viewing habits for advertising. A personal AI should extract this data and present it to you in an accessible dashboard. 
 Car GPS &amp; Telematics Data: Your car knows where you’ve been but doesn’t give you that data—only the manufacturer or service providers get it. Your AI should sync and store this information for personal use. 
 Smartphone Location &amp; App Data: Google, Apple, and app developers already track routes and check-ins. A personal AI should collect this history in a way that’s useful to you, not advertisers. 
 Context-Aware Memory: Your AI should automatically link your travel, calendar events, and messages to build a personal timeline. 
 
<p>Would you want your AI to proactively notify you about trends in your behavior (e.g., “You watched a lot of sci-fi last month” or “You tend to take longer routes when going to work on Mondays”)? Or should it remain passive until you query it?</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 You said: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 I would like that kind of option. The default should be passive, with the ability to turn on reactive and proactive features. I also don’t think activities, uses, practices, habits, and behaviors are all the same, or should be lumped together under a heading such as “behavior” or “behavioral.” That’s the kind of angle advertisers take. What I want are ways to collect, store, view, and query data and metadata about areas in my life such as the seven you listed above. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ChatGPT said: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>That makes perfect sense. Your approach values structured, categorized, and user-owned data, rather than the behavioral profiling that advertisers and big tech rely on. Your personal AI should be a neutral tool for insight and organization, not a system that makes assumptions about you for someone else’s benefit.</p>
 Your AI’s Data Structure 
<p>Instead of reducing everything to “behavior,” it would categorize and organize data meaningfully, such as:</p>
 
 Communication – Messages, emails, calls, writing history 
 Work &amp; Productivity – Schedules, projects, task tracking 
 Knowledge &amp; Learning – Articles, books, media history 
 Health &amp; Wellness – Fitness, sleep, diet, well-being 
 Finances &amp; Transactions – Budgets, subscriptions, spending 
 Home &amp; Environment – Smart home, shopping, routines 
 Personal Projects – Creative work, hobbies, personal archives 
 
<p>Each category would be independent yet cross-referencable, allowing queries like:</p>
 
 “What projects was I working on the last time I had lunch with [Person]?” 
 “What was my screen time trend over the past six months?” 
 “Which subscriptions are up for renewal in the next 30 days?” 
 
 Control Over Notifications &amp; AI Engagement 
 
 Default Passive Mode → AI only responds when asked. 
 Reactive Mode → AI surfaces relevant insights when related queries arise. 
 Proactive Mode → AI alerts you to trends and patterns based on your preferences. 
 
<p>This model makes your AI flexible—not an intrusive presence, but an active assistant only when desired.</p>
<p>Would you also want the ability to manually edit, correct, or delete any stored data, similar to how you’d manage files on a personal computer?</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 You said: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Yes, I would like as much editing and organizing optionality as possible. For example, I would like views that could be alphabetical, numerical, sequential, functional, categorical, contextual, geographical, causal, sorted by size, weight or distance, and so on. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ChatGPT said: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>That level of customization and control would make your personal AI a true digital assistant, not just a passive data repository. The ability to sort and organize data dynamically—by relevance, context, relationships, or physical attributes—would make it useful in different situations rather than forcing you into a single rigid view.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
 
 Geographical Sorting → “Show me all locations I visited in the past year, sorted by distance from my home.” 
 Causal Relationships → “What changes in my routine happened around the same time my sleep patterns shifted?” 
 Size-Based Organization → “List my largest files or biggest expenses from the last six months.” 
 Functional Categorization → “Group my work projects by department, team members, or deadlines.” 
 
<p>Would you also want custom tagging, so you could create your own categories and relationships between data points?</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 You said: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 I would want anything that makes it easy to gather archives for everything useful to know in my life, and then make use of it. For that broad challenge, I think of personal AI more as a tool (such as a PC or a phone) than an assistant, though having it provide assistance of many kinds would be one collection of uses. I remember when PCs came along, people thought they would be good ways to store recipes, play games, write things, and draw. Then spreadsheets appeared, and suddenly they made workers more valuable to companies than the companies’ own mainframes. Fifty years later we are still discovering new things for personal computers to do. I think the same should be true for personal AI. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ChatGPT said: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>That’s a visionary and practical approach—seeing personal AI as a foundational tool rather than just a glorified chatbot. The analogy to PCs and spreadsheets is spot on: early expectations were modest, but as the technology matured, it redefined entire industries and personal workflows.</p>
<p>If personal AI is treated like a personal computer, rather than just a narrow Q&amp;A assistant, then:</p>
 
 It should be multi-functional → Handling storage, organization, processing, retrieval, and automation of personal data. 
 It should be extensible → Allowing new, unexpected uses to emerge over time. 
 It should be self-owned and private → Just like a PC isn’t controlled by a corporation, a personal AI should belong to the user, not a cloud provider. 
 
<p>Would you want it to support custom apps or extensions so you (or others) could develop and plug in new features over time, just like PCs gained software ecosystems?</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 You said: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 That sounds like a good idea. The main thing for me is that the underlying OS is open source and general purpose. We don’t quite have that for PCs (with Apple’s Mac OS and Microsoft’s Windows) or for phones (with Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android), but I think there is some hope, at this early stage, for an open source operating system such as Kwaai’s pAI-OS. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ChatGPT said: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>That makes a lot of sense. Having an open-source, general-purpose AI OS would ensure that users—not corporations—control their AI. Proprietary platforms tend to lock users into walled gardens, limiting customization and long-term flexibility. An open AI OS like Kwaai’s pAI-OS (or something similar) could allow:</p>
 
 Full user ownership and transparency—no hidden data collection. 
 Custom apps and extensions—letting users shape their AI’s evolution. 
 Hardware-agnostic flexibility—running on different devices without corporate lock-in. 
 
<p>If an AI OS like this matures, it could be the AI equivalent of Linux—a foundation for truly personal and private AI computing. Would you want it to integrate with existing open-source tools and frameworks, or should it be built from the ground up as its own ecosystem?</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 You said: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 I like the Linux model, and I wouldn’t want to take any approach off the table. Though I have an easier time imagining an ecosystem growing on top of an OS, and perhaps a piece of specialized hardware, optimized for large storage and the kind of processing that personal AI requires. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ChatGPT said: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>That makes sense—an open-source OS as the foundation, with an ecosystem of tools and specialized hardware built on top. The idea of AI-optimized personal hardware is compelling, especially for:</p>
 
 Local AI processing → Reducing reliance on cloud services. 
 Massive personal storage → Keeping lifetime archives of useful data. 
 Privacy &amp; security → Ensuring all AI computations stay in user control. 
 
<p>Something like an AI-first equivalent of a personal computer, but optimized for storage, contextual recall, and intelligent assistance. Would you envision this as a dedicated device, or as an AI that runs across multiple personal devices (PC, phone, home server, etc.)?</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 You said: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 I imagine personal AI working primarily on a dedicated device that is optimized for AI work, but accessible from other personal devices. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ChatGPT said: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>That’s a solid approach—having a dedicated AI hub for processing and storage, while allowing secure access from other personal devices. This setup would:</p>
 
 Keep the AI powerful and private—avoiding reliance on cloud services. 
 Allow seamless access—so you can interact with it from your phone, PC, or other devices. 
 Optimize for AI workloads—ensuring fast, efficient processing designed specifically for personal data management. 
 
<p>Would you want this AI device to be modular and upgradeable, similar to how desktop PCs allow for component upgrades, or would you prefer a more streamlined, appliance-like design?</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 You said: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 I am prejudiced by my PC experience toward the former, but I also understand that, once the market gets large and active, the world may fill with appliances. Hard to say. Practical utility should rule. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ChatGPT said: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>That’s a pragmatic stance—favoring modularity and user control while recognizing that market forces may lead to more appliance-like AI devices. The key will be ensuring practical utility remains the driving factor, whether through:</p>
 
 Customizable, upgradeable hardware (like PCs today). 
 Streamlined, dedicated AI appliances (if they prove more effective). 
 Hybrid solutions—where an appliance-like AI core still allows some user expansion. 
 
<p>It’ll be interesting to see which direction the market takes. Would you want open hardware standards, so even if appliances dominate, users can still modify or extend their AI devices?</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 You said: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Yes, open standards are essential. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ChatGPT said: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>That’s a crucial stance—open standards would ensure that even if the market trends toward closed appliances, users retain control over their AI devices. This would allow:</p>
 
 Hardware customization and repairability—preventing forced obsolescence. 
 Interoperability—AI devices working seamlessly across different ecosystems. 
 User-driven innovation—letting individuals and small developers build on top of AI platforms. 
 
<p>Open standards have been critical in computing (e.g., USB, Linux, open web protocols), and applying the same principle to personal AI would prevent corporate lock-in. Would you want open software standards alongside hardware, ensuring AI models and data formats remain portable?</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 You said: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Sure. I want everything to be as open as possible, to foster all kinds of invention, uses, and market creation and growth. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ChatGPT said: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>That’s the best way to ensure long-term innovation and user control—letting an open ecosystem evolve organically, rather than being locked into proprietary silos. This approach would:</p>
 
 Encourage invention—allowing developers, individuals, and small companies to build on AI freely. 
 Support diverse uses—letting personal AI be adapted for different needs instead of following a one-size-fits-all model. 
 Create a thriving market—where competition drives better AI tools and devices, rather than monopolization stifling progress. 
 
<p>If AI follows the open computing model rather than the closed-platform model of today’s big tech, it could become as transformative as PCs and the internet. Do you see any key obstacles to achieving this kind of open AI ecosystem?</p>
 
 You said: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The first obstacle is lack of imagination. Personal AI is not especially thinkable in an environment where nearly all AI is corporate. (Though we are thinking about it here, and that is a good thing—perhaps even pioneering.) The second obstacle is incumbency. All the bigs—OpenAI, Microsoft, Anthropic, Deepseek, Meta, et. al.—are centralized and proprietary (with the partial and provisional exception of Meta), and making most of their money selling to enterprises. Apple and Microsoft are both built for selling to individuals, but Apple will want to lock people into its proprietary gear and services, and Microsoft these days seems to care much more about enterprise services. But it’s very early, so maybe those two obstacles will fall. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ChatGPT said: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>That’s a sharp assessment. Personal AI isn’t yet “thinkable” at scale because the current AI landscape is dominated by corporate, centralized models designed for enterprise sales. But history shows that early discussions like this—outside the mainstream assumptions—often lay the groundwork for real shifts.</p>
 Overcoming These Obstacles 
 
 Expanding Imagination → The more people envision and discuss personal AI, the more likely it is to emerge as a real category. Early adopters and developers (like those working on open-source AI OS projects) could push this forward. 
 Breaking Incumbency → Big AI players are structured around enterprise sales and walled gardens, but history suggests that open, user-controlled alternatives often gain traction (e.g., Linux vs. Windows, the early web vs. closed networks). 
 
<p>You’re right—it’s very early, and just as PCs weren’t obvious in the 1970s, personal AI is still waiting for its breakthrough moment. Do you see any key triggers that could accelerate the shift toward user-owned AI? (E.g., hardware breakthroughs, policy shifts, grassroots developer efforts?)</p>
 You said:&nbsp; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Invention is the mother of necessity. We need inventions that mother demand for personal AI. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ChatGPT said: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>That’s exactly right—breakthrough inventions will create the demand, not the other way around. Just as:</p>
 
 The personal computer created demand for home computing. 
 The smartphone created demand for constant connectivity. 
 The spreadsheet made PCs indispensable for business. 
 
<p>Personal AI needs its own transformative inventions—capabilities that only a truly user-owned AI can deliver, making it impossible to ignore.</p>
<p>What kind of first killer use cases do you think could drive mass adoption? Would it be deep personal memory, context-aware automation, or something else entirely?</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 You said: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 I think it will be apps that bring subscriptions and other recurring expenses under control, so people can see what they are paying for, how long they’ve been using it, for what, and how long their commitments are slated to last. Subscription TV, music streaming, satellite radio, and online newsletters come first to mind. Household utility rates vary with usage, but having a clear picture of usage history, rate changes and other variables will be valuable. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ChatGPT said: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>That’s a compelling first wave of personal AI utility—helping people see and manage their financial commitments in a way that’s currently fragmented across different apps and platforms. A personal AI-powered expense tracker could:</p>
 
 Map out all active subscriptions across services. 
 Show real usage data (e.g., “You haven’t watched Hulu in 3 months”). 
 Flag upcoming renewals and suggest cancellations or downgrades. 
 Analyze utility bills for usage trends and rate fluctuations. 
 
<p>This would solve a real, widespread problem while demonstrating how personal AI can provide long-term memory, pattern recognition, and decision-making support.</p>
<p>Would you want it to also track one-time purchases (like software licenses, annual fees, or large purchases) for long-term cost awareness?</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 You said: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 I think all purchases should flow into one’s personal database. I’d love to have a device through which could feed paper receipts, have them read (informed by machine learning and pattern recognition, including OCR), and organized. Same goes for all the purchase made on Amazon, eBay, and other online retailers. I would like to have the data in one’s credit card statements, which one can access online, also flow into the same database, with itemized line items (which credit card statements don’t provide). For example, the way Amazon organizes its purchase records by shipment often don’t square with what shows up on a credit card statement, even though no over- or under-payment has occurred. Machine logic can work out the particulars and present coherent and complete accountings. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ChatGPT said: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>That’s a powerful vision—a fully integrated personal financial archive where every purchase, from paper receipts to digital transactions, is automatically captured, categorized, and reconciled.</p>
<p>A dedicated receipt scanner that feeds into your personal AI database would be especially useful—no more manually sorting through old receipts. And with credit card and online purchase data, your AI could:</p>
 
 Automatically match transactions between different records. 
 Clarify confusing entries (e.g., Amazon shipments vs. credit card charges). 
 Detect errors, double charges, or missed refunds. 
 Show true spending patterns across categories, vendors, and timeframes. 
 
<p>Would you also want the AI to track warranties, return policies, and price drop alerts based on your purchases?</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 You said: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Yes, but I would like personal AI to make clear to companies that they don’t need gimmicks and games to earn patronage and loyalty. Right now, customers have no good way to signal interest or loyalty, or to make their purchasing intentions or actual loyalty known to whole markets or relevant market segments. Instead, we have as many different CRM (customer relationship management) and CX (customer experience) systems as there are companies operating them, and all of these are deployed in different ways, always for the purpose of customer entrapment and control. What customers need is VRM (vendor relationship management) that provides one customer hand for many sellers to shake, plus ways to “intentcast”—signal an intention to buy—to whole markets, and to have standard ways to maintain purchase, warranty, and other relevant records, so markets really can become productive conversations between customers and companies. With cooperative intelligent agents on both sides, and ways for VRM to meet CRM, customers and companies will have much more useful intelligence about how products and services are actually used—and can be fixed as that need arises. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ChatGPT said: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>That’s a radical but necessary shift—turning markets from one-sided customer tracking and manipulation into genuine, mutually beneficial relationships.</p>
<p>With VRM (vendor relationship management) in place, personal AI could empower individuals to engage with markets on their own terms, rather than being passively targeted and managed by corporate CRM systems.</p>
 How This Could Work: 
 
 Personal AI as a Market Agent → Instead of passively receiving ads, individuals could broadcast intent to relevant vendors. 
 Standardized Purchase &amp; Warranty Records → No more scattered receipts—your AI would keep a unified, user-controlled archive. 
 Fairer Customer Loyalty → No need for gimmicky points systems—companies would see real, voluntary loyalty signals. 
 Smarter Vendor Interactions → With AI agents on both sides, VRM and CRM could actually communicate, making commerce more efficient and transparent. 
 
<p>This flips the script from corporate-driven surveillance to user-controlled engagement. Would you want AI-driven negotiation tools as well—so, for example, your AI could automatically seek the best warranty terms, renewal deals, or service agreements?</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 You said: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 AI-driven negotiation tools will be good, but I think also less necessary once the best knowledge and signaling mechanisms are in place on both the customer and company sides. The ideal close-to-end state is transparency of both demand and supply data and intentions, and simple and straightforward pricing and service offerings. Considering the case of Trader Joe’s. This is perhaps the most loved retailer in the U.S., and it earns that love without any loyalty program, without putting any “on sale,” without any gimmicks of any kind, and without any marketing beyond a float in the Rose Parade and an opt-in flyer. The cognitive overhead on both sizes is close to zero, and the operational overhead on Trader Joe’s side is low as well, simply because they aren’t busy trying to track and manipulate their customers, and bearing the costs involved. As for individuals being able to engage markets on their own terms, this is what IEEE P7012, a standard currently in development and known by the nickname MyTerms, aims to do. It will reverse the current “notice and consent” regime run entirely by sites and services by making individuals the first parties to contracts requiring forms of respect for personal privacy. This too can greatly simplify the way markets operate, and obviate the need for more contentious privacy regulations.

<p>That’s a clear and compelling vision—a marketplace where trust, transparency, and efficiency replace the current manipulation-based system. Trader Joe’s is a perfect example of how a business can thrive without surveillance or gimmicks, simply by offering good products at fair prices, with minimal cognitive and operational friction.</p>
<p>If IEEE P7012 (“MyTerms”) succeeds, it could be a major breakthrough in restoring personal agency in digital markets. Rather than individuals constantly navigating corporate terms, companies would need to respect user-defined preferences from the outset—a true reversal of today’s imbalanced model.</p>
<p>Would you like to explore how personal AI could integrate with MyTerms, ensuring your AI automatically enforces your market preferences and privacy terms whenever you engage with companies?</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 You said: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Sure. What do you have in mind? Start with the terms—a roster of possible agreements—listed at Customer Commons, much as personal copyright licenses have long been listed at Creative Commons. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ChatGPT said: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>​Establishing a system akin to Creative Commons for personal data and privacy—such as the terms proposed by Customer Commons—would empower individuals to define and communicate their own privacy preferences and data-sharing terms. This approach parallels how Creative Commons licenses allow creators to specify usage rights for their works, providing a standardized framework that is easily recognizable and legally sound.​</p>
<p>Integrating Personal AI with User-Defined Privacy Terms:</p>
 
 
<p>Centralized Management: Your personal AI could serve as the central repository for your privacy preferences, storing and managing your chosen terms from Customer Commons.​</p>
 
 
<p>Automated Communication: When interacting with companies or services, your AI could automatically communicate your predefined terms, ensuring that your privacy preferences are clearly stated and understood.​</p>
 
 
<p>Compliance Monitoring: The AI could monitor interactions and data exchanges to ensure that companies adhere to your specified terms, alerting you to any discrepancies or breaches.​</p>
 
 
<p>Negotiation Facilitation: In cases where standard terms do not align perfectly with a company’s policies, your AI could facilitate negotiations to reach a mutually acceptable agreement, streamlining the process and reducing manual effort.​</p>
 
 
<p>Benefits of This Integration:</p>
 
 
<p>Empowerment: Individuals gain control over their personal data, specifying exactly how it can be used and shared.​</p>
 
 
<p>Transparency: Clear communication of privacy terms fosters trust between consumers and companies.​</p>
 
 
<p>Efficiency: Automated processes reduce the need for repetitive manual settings and consent forms, simplifying user experiences.​</p>
 
 
<p>Legal Clarity: Standardized terms provide a clear legal framework, reducing ambiguities and potential disputes.​</p>
 
 
<p>By leveraging personal AI to manage and enforce user-defined privacy terms, we move towards a more balanced digital ecosystem where individual preferences are respected, and companies can engage with consumers in a transparent and mutually beneficial manner.​</p>

 That’s good. Two additiona items. First, I would replace “user” with “person” or “individual,” because “user” implies that the individual is a subordinate actor in a system operated by a corporate entity, and because in MyTerms ceremonies the person is the first party making the first move by proffering his or her own terms. The person in this role is not a “user” in the usual sense. Second, while negotiation will surely play a role downstream and in many individual cases, it is essential for simple privacy requirements to be simply respected. Once that initial agreement is reached, negotiation on variables not covered by the initial contract can take place, and cooperative personal and corporate AIs can help with that. But for market adoption, we need the simple non-negotiated terms to succeed first. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ChatGPT said: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>That’s an important distinction—“person” or “individual” asserts agency and control, rather than the corporate-defined role of a “user”. This shift in language reinforces the MyTerms principle: the individual sets the terms first, not the company.</p>
<p>I also fully agree that market adoption depends on simple, non-negotiated terms succeeding first. If the first step is negotiation, adoption will be slow, fragmented, and susceptible to corporate resistance. Instead:</p>
 
 Basic privacy requirements must be respected outright—no haggling. 
 Only after that can negotiations begin on additional variables. 
 Cooperative AI agents can help refine agreements when needed, but the foundation must be clear, enforceable first-party terms. 
 
<p>This two-stage model—first-party terms first, negotiation second—ensures a strong, practical path to adoption. Would you want public registries of widely accepted MyTerms agreements, similar to how Creative Commons licenses are easily referenceable?</p>

 At least one public registry would be required. MyTerms (IEEE P7012) was initiated by an approach to Customer Commons by the IEEE, and Customer Commons is prepared to play that role. But there should be nothing to prevent others from creating their own. My only concern is that the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) or some other body favoring tracking-based advertising might stand up an alternative registry that does not favor individuals. But I don’t see that happening, given the IAB’s historic position in opposition to maximized personal agency respecting privacy. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ChatGPT said: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>That makes sense—a primary public registry (such as Customer Commons) would provide a trusted reference point, but allowing others to create their own registries ensures openness and decentralization.</p>
<p>Your concern about an IAB-backed registry is valid—if a registry were co-opted to favor corporate interests over individual agency, it could dilute or undermine the intent of MyTerms. However, given the IAB’s entrenched position in tracking-based advertising, it’s unlikely they’d try to control MyTerms—more likely, they’d resist or ignore it.</p>
<p>Would you want a certification system to help distinguish authentic, person-first registries from potential corporate attempts to dilute the standard?</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 You said: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 That may be a good idea. Who or what would do the certification? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ChatGPT said: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>A certification system could help ensure that MyTerms registries remain aligned with the principle of individual agency, rather than being co-opted by corporate interests. The challenge is who certifies? There are a few possible models:</p>
 1. IEEE as the Certifying Authority 
 
 Since IEEE P7012 (MyTerms) is an IEEE standard, IEEE itself could establish a certification process to verify that registries comply with the standard’s intent. 
 Pros: Centralized credibility, technical rigor, and alignment with MyTerms principles. 
 Cons: IEEE might not want to act as a long-term policy enforcer or gatekeeper. 
 
 2. Customer Commons as the Lead Certifier 
 
 Since Customer Commons initiated MyTerms with IEEE, it could take the lead in certifying registries that uphold individual-first principles. 
 Pros: Deep alignment with MyTerms, strong advocacy for personal agency. 
 Cons: Might be seen as self-governing rather than neutral. 
 
 3. A Consortium of Ethical Digital Rights Groups 
 
 Certification could be handled by a coalition of respected privacy, consumer rights, and digital ethics organizations (e.g., EFF, Mozilla, Customer Commons, MyData, etc.). 
 Pros: Distributed authority, independence from corporate influence. 
 Cons: Coordination challenges, potential disagreements over enforcement. 
 
 4. A Decentralized, Web-of-Trust Model 
 
 Instead of a single certifier, verification could be community-driven, similar to PGP key-signing or decentralized identity models. 
 Pros: Harder for any entity to take control or corrupt the system. 
 Cons: Slower adoption, possible fragmentation. 
 
 5. Government or Regulatory Involvement 
 
 A consumer protection agency (e.g., FTC, EU regulators) could certify compliant registries. 
 Pros: Strong legal backing. 
 Cons: Heavy bureaucracy, risk of capture by corporate lobbying. 
 
 
 Best Path? 
<p>A hybrid model might work best—IEEE defining compliance criteria, Customer Commons as a primary certifier, and other trusted organizations participating to ensure transparency and fairness.</p>
<p>Would you prefer a single authoritative certifier, or a more distributed, decentralized certification model to prevent monopolization?</p>
 
<p>I’m leaving this here for now, both because I’m out of time (and this is way too long) and because I don’t have adequate thoughts about certification—yet. And I welcome input on that, and everything else.</p>

But new medical guidelines from Germany, Austria, and Switzerland tell a different story. These countries have reaffirmed the importance of gender-affirming care for transgender youth and issued sharp critiques of the Cass Review, calling out its severe methodological flaws and misrepresentations."</p></blockquote><p>They contain this specific recommendation:</p><blockquote><p>“If, in individual cases, the progressive pubertal maturation development creates a time pressure in which health damage would be expected due to longer waiting times to avert irreversible bodily changes (e.g. male voice change), access to child and adolescent psychiatric or psychotherapeutic clarification and medical treatment options should be granted as quickly as possible.”</p></blockquote><p>Once again, a rejection of the Cass Review is good news here: the widely debunked study was essentially propaganda for anti-trans interests and didn't represent broader healthcare perspectives.</p><p>But the bigger good news is that Europe is a safer place for trans people to live and be supported.

 AI時代におけるデータのアクセスおよび共有の促進<br>ー OECD理事会勧告「データアクセスと共有の促進」の付属文書 
 



<p>以下はその内容を大まかにまとめたものです。詳しくは原文を御覧ください。</p>



 概要 



 
 OECDのデータへのアクセスと共有の強化に関する勧告（EASD）は、権利保護を確保しながらデータの利益を最大化するための枠組みを提供します。 



 経済的、社会的、法的考慮を統合したデータガバナンスへの全政府的アプローチを強調しています。 



 この勧告は、OECDのメンバーおよびパートナーによる自発的な遵守を促し、責任あるデータ共有の実践を推進します。 
 



 データガバナンスの主要概念 



 
 データ価値サイクル: データの作成から削除までの全ライフサイクルをカバーし、アルゴリズムや人間のスキルなどの補完的リソースの必要性を強調します。 



 データオープンネスの連続体: 閉じたデータからオープンなデータまでのアクセスを分類する枠組みであり、リスクと信頼に基づいたカスタマイズされた共有の取り決めを可能にします。 



 データエコシステム: データホルダー、プロデューサー、中介者などのさまざまな利害関係者が相互作用し、価値を生み出すため、対立する利益のバランスを取るための協力と信頼が必要です。 
 



 データアクセスと共有の強化のための原則 



 
 信頼の強化: 利害関係者を相談や透明性を通じて関与させ、データガバナンスに対する信頼を築きます。 



 データへの投資: データ共有を促進するために市場ベースのアプローチや持続可能なビジネスモデルを推進し、イノベーションのための規制サンドボックスを含めます。 



 データの効果的な利用: データが見つけやすく、アクセス可能で、相互運用可能で、再利用可能（FAIR原則）であることを確保し、国境を越えたデータ共有を促進します。 
 



 実践的な応用と影響 



 
 政府は、責任あるデータガバナンスを促進するためにEASDの原則に沿った国家データ戦略を採用すべきです。 



 プライバシーと知的財産権を保護しながらデータ共有を支援するために、一貫した法的枠組みが必要です。 



 さまざまな国からの成功事例は、データアクセスの強化における公私パートナーシップと利害関係者の関与の重要性を示しています。 
 



 データ共有インフラの強化 



 
 中央集権的データリポジトリ: 公共機関間での効率的な情報共有を促進するために中央集権的なインフラを確立し、サービス提供を改善し、データ駆動型の公共政策を支援します。 



 公共の関与: データ駆動型経済の利点とリスクに対する公共の理解を深めるために、責任あるデータ共有の実践を促進します。 



 利害関係者の意見: イノベーションを妨げることなくAI関連のリスクに対処するために、規制に関する議論に利害関係者を関与させます。 
 



 競争当局への影響 



 
 市場のダイナミクス: 消費者データと引き換えに無料の製品を提供するマルチサイドビジネスモデルの影響を考慮し、市場力を固定化する可能性があります。 



 需要側の特性: データが市場のダイナミクスに影響を与え、検索コスト、切り替えコスト、消費者の選択に影響を及ぼし、支配的な市場ポジションを強化する可能性があることを認識します。 
 



 研究における責任あるデータ共有 



 
 研究データの共有: 機関や研究者間でのデータ共有を促進するために、オーストラリアの責任ある研究行動に関するコードに沿ったガイドラインに従います。 



 ライセンスの分類: AIや機械学習におけるデータ利用に関連する責任と権利を明確にするためのデータライセンスの分類を開発します。 
 



 オープンガバメントデータとAI 



 
 オープンデータの重要性: オープンガバメントデータは、AIシステムの開発とトレーニングに不可欠であり、信頼できる入力として機能します。 



 リスク管理: オープンデータは、データの出所やソースの信頼性に関連するリスクを管理し、AIアプリケーションの整合性を高めます。 
 



 結論の洞察 



 
 OECDのEASDに関する勧告は、データアクセスと共有を強化するための包括的な枠組みを提供し、信頼、投資、効果的なガバナンスを強調しています。 



 これらの原則を実施することで、公共サービスの改善、データ駆動型経済におけるイノベーション、責任あるAIの開発につながる可能性があります。 



 利害関係者の継続的な関与と確立されたガイドラインの遵守は、データ共有イニシアチブの完全な潜在能力を実現するために不可欠です。

Thompson, ProPublica and FRONTLINE, James Bandler, ProPublica, and Lukáš Diko, Investigative Center of Jan Kuciak</a>]</p><p>A tragic story of a teenager recruited by a network of extremists, who ultimately murdered multiple people before taking his own life. It's also an example of why moderation and safety processes on social platforms are so important.</p><blockquote><p>"And so in August 2019, Juraj Krajčík, then a soft-faced 16-year-old with a dense pile of brown hair, immersed himself in a loose collection of extremist chat groups and channels on the massive social media and messaging platform Telegram. This online community, which was dubbed Terrorgram, had a singular focus: inciting acts of white supremacist terrorism."</p></blockquote><p>This is particularly relevant in a world where companies like X and Meta are cutting back on their safety teams and policies. It's not as easy as waving your hands and saying that it should be a matter for the courts; real lives are at stake. And at the same time, there is, of course, a real danger of falling into the trap of building a surveillance network.</p><p>The police at the time thought this was the work of a lone gunman rather than the international community of extremists it actually was. Uncovering this is also the kind of story that only investigative newsrooms can do really well:</p><blockquote><p>"ProPublica and the PBS series FRONTLINE, along with the Slovakian newsroom Investigative Center of Jan Kuciak, pieced together the story behind Krajčík’s evolution from a troubled teenager to mass shooter. We identified his user name on Telegram, which allowed us to sift through tens of thousands of now-deleted Telegram posts that had not previously been linked to him."</p></blockquote><p>Hopefully this work can help prevent this and similar networks from operating in the future. Likely a more holistic approach is needed, and if law enforcement, educators, and social workers are more aware of the potential risks and playbooks, hopefully they can be more sophisticated about prevention.</p>

What they might have more trouble with is getting an outside stakeholder to commit to just-in-time availability; I imagine that a weekly touch-base meeting might be the norm in many non-engineering-centric organizations. But they're all important, and all very concrete ways to both improve performance on an engineering team and improve the experience of working on one.</p>

<p>This post is a more technical follow-up to the <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/utah-blazes-new-trail-for-ssi-sedi-441d8ce65ab8">post announcing the passing of SB 260 in Utah</a>, establishing the principles for state-endorsed digital identity (SEDI). While SEDI does not mandate any particular technology, its mandated principles close the door for technologies that do not comply, and open the door for technologies that do. This article explores what SEDI makes technically possible, in compliance with SB 260 principles.</p><p>State-endorsed digital identity (SEDI) introduces numerous foundational principles for a government-sponsored digital identity system, several of which were covered in <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/utah-blazes-new-trail-for-ssi-sedi-441d8ce65ab8">Utah Blazes New Trail for SSI:&nbsp;SEDI</a>:</p>  “Endorse” vs. “issue” and “identity” vs. “credential”  Sovereign control  Guardianship  Privacy &amp; no surveillance  State-of-the-art security  <p>This post explores more technical and security principles enabled by SEDI that will be of interest to digital identity&nbsp;experts.</p> “Autonomic” Identifiers <p>SEDI doesn’t mandate any specific technology stack, but it does specify capabilities that are simply unachievable for most digital identity technologies. One foundational example is the requirement in lines (73) — (77) of the <a href="https://le.utah.gov/~2025/bills/static/SB0260.html">Utah bill</a>, that individuals must first bring their “identity” to the state, after which it can be endorsed.</p><p>What kind of “identity” might that be? That will be specified as the details of Utah’s future identity program are fleshed out. As a Utah citizen and as an outside expert invited to consult on these new identity policies, I will push for stringent minimum standards for the security, utility, privacy, and autonomy of a digital identity to qualify for state endorsement. Needless to say, your social media login — or even your bank login — should not&nbsp;suffice.</p><p>One “identity” that meets my preferred standard is an “Autonomic Identifier” or AID, as first described in Dr. Samuel Smith’s seminal paper: <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-keri-specification/">Key Event Receipt Infrastructure</a> (KERI).</p><p>Some of the capabilities enabled by an AID-powered SEDI ecosystem include:</p><p>BYOID (Bring Your Own Identifier) — In the digital realm, for an identity to be self sovereign, it must begin with a unique identifier that is under the sovereign control of an individual. When a state endorses an identity, in practice they are endorsing an identifier that an individual has brought to the state that is provably under the individual’s control.</p><p>Persistent Identifiers — When that individual moves their residence to another state (within the U.S., for example), necessitating a new identity endorsement from the new state, the old state can revoke their endorsement of the same identifier that the new state will be endorsing; the identifier is persistent. This is a KERI capability that is very different from most PKI-based systems where the identifier is a public key that is discarded upon rotation or revocation.</p><p>Reputation — This persistence creates a continuity for the individual to retain and build their digital reputation independent from any particular government endorsement. In fact, it would be inclusive of every endorsement they have ever had, and all their provable behaviors using those endorsements, no matter how many states or countries have given them past endorsements of identity. And it would be inclusive of non-state endorsements such as educational, work, or anything else,&nbsp;too.</p> Putting It All&nbsp;Together <p>A simple depiction of SEDI built on AIDs might look like&nbsp;this:</p><p>AIDs enable true self-sovereignty as the foundation, right where it belongs and where it provides the greatest utility for all aspects of digital life. State endorsement is also situated right where it belongs: as only one of many endorsements an individual may receive through their digital lifetime.</p> State-Issued ‘Jenga’ <p>Conversely, building digital identity on top of a state-issued credential instead of a state-endorsed identifier lasts only until the state revokes that credential. An attached academic credential, for example, is lost when the individual moves from one state to another and obtains a new identity in the new state, and the old state revokes the now-obsolete issuance.</p><p>Look at this visually:</p><p>This is like a game of Jenga: pull out the state-issued ID — by moving from one state or country to another — and the whole stack falls down. When the state revokes the ID they’ve issued, you also lose everything cryptographically bound to it, and must start&nbsp;over.</p><p>Even if the old state kept their credential alive, there is no binding between old and new credentials, no way to build a growing, persistent reputation that connects a person to their cross-boundary behaviors in the digital world the same way a consistent legal name connects their behaviors across boundaries in the physical&nbsp;world.</p> Human-Friendly? <p>Autonomic identifiers cannot be human-friendly. Human-friendly namespaces require human management, recurring cost, and have scarcity problems like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybersquatting">cybersquatting</a>, or missing the opportunity to register Timothy.com or timothy@gmail; the 1,000th Timothy won’t have much of a selection. AIDs are long random strings of letters and numbers, and are so incredibly random it would take a million computers a million years to guess one, which ensures universal uniqueness and brings a strong measure of security.</p><p>AIDs have cryptographic properties, so we can prove control over them in the digital realm and recover control when keys are compromised. And keys *will* get compromised (see “Expected Compromise” below). Without these special mathematical properties, they’d be just letters and numbers anyone can copy and use to impersonate, like a social security&nbsp;number.</p> Many Identifiers <p>In real life, we have identifiers that are public — our legal names — that typically remain constant throughout our lives. We use these identifiers to build reputations over time, as patterns of behaviors accumulate that are associated with them. With SEDI, the identifier that is endorsed by the state will work in the same manner: it will be persistent, and as public as one chooses to make it, used and disclosed (always under the hood) whenever one might disclose their legal&nbsp;name.</p><p>In digital situations where one prefers to not use their legal name, there’s nothing in SEDI preventing that individual from using a completely different identifier, unrelated to their endorsed one. In fact there is no limit on how many different unique identifiers one may create and use for whatever purpose they choose; and each state can choose whether or not only one at a time can be officially endorsed (Utah allows only one physical identity at a time, and may do the same digitally).</p> Potential Security Advantages <p>SEDI’s architecture enables numerous critical security advantages that could be implemented:</p><p>Zero Trust — ”Never trust, always verify” is the ideal of zero trust. SEDI can not only embrace zero trust, it can enable true zero trust, which does away with all shared secrets, described briefly&nbsp;below.</p><p>No Shared Secrets — SEDI doesn’t employ bearer tokens, symmetric keys, or phishable passwords, unless they are used in conjunction with digital signatures. (Pins and passwords can be helpful when used in addition to digital signatures or physical&nbsp;keys)</p><p>Anti-fragile — A breach of one person or system does not facilitate the breach of the entire system or another connected one, as with most current digital identity systems, which are predicated on shared secrets and perimeter security. With SEDI, most breaches can be detectable, preventable, and recoverable.</p><p>Expected Compromise — Key compromise should be expected and anticipated — and not surprising and catastrophic — in addition to robust prevention and detection capabilities, bringing powerful means for recovery.</p><p>Multi-signature — Keys and credentials can be protected with m-of-n weighted multi-signature capabilities, enabling creative familial, professional, and social protection and recovery&nbsp;schemes.</p><p>Mutual authentication — Individuals could authenticate each other, in any setting. For example, a citizen could authenticate a police officer as readily as a police officer can authenticate the citizen. Any person, organization, or thing claiming authority from the state could be instantly verified to have the claimed authority.</p> Artificially Intelligent Agents (“Agentic AI”) <p>IBM predicts that 2025 may be “<a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/insights/ai-agents-2025-expectations-vs-reality">the year of the AI agent</a>”, and the CEO of Microsoft predicts that agentic AI will “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=satya+nadella+agentic+ai">replace all software</a>.” Whether that happens or not, AI agents are coming and will soon affect the way we interact with organizations of all kinds. This can take the form of you interacting with some organization’s agent, some organization interacting with your agent, or two AI agents interacting with each&nbsp;other.</p><p>SEDI paves the way for verifying that an AI agent has the delegated authority it claims to have, and constraining what an agent is authorized to do. SEDI enables authority to be delegated to people, organizations, and things, and AI agents are things. SEDI is uniquely well suited for controlling, securing, and navigating a world of ubiquitous AI&nbsp;agents.</p><p>Many don’t like the idea of having to deal with AI agents in any form, and I can’t blame them. But like the digital transformation itself, that world is coming whether we like it or not, and the more controls and constraints we can have for it, the&nbsp;better.</p> Comprehensive Digital&nbsp;Identity <p>In sum, SEDI enables a cohesive, comprehensive digital identity system for a state or for any other ecosystem. It requires no proprietary platforms, products, or providers, though it doesn’t preclude their participation, and requires no shared or trusted intermediaries or blockchains. Through robust guardianship, delegation, and multi-sig, it extends digital capabilities to populations that have been previously excluded: minors (including infants), the elderly, disabled persons, homeless persons, migrants, and any other population. And it does this while maximizing individual autonomy and control over one’s data, with powerful means for consent, and numerous breakthroughs in security.</p><p>In short, SEDI heralds a new era of utility, security and autonomy for comprehensive digital identity ecosystems, and I am proud of my home state of Utah for introducing it to the&nbsp;world.</p>

 Finally! <p>On March 4, 2025, the Utah legislature unanimously passed <a href="https://le.utah.gov/~2025/bills/static/SB0260.html">SB 260</a>, a groundbreaking digital identity bill that carries this description:</p><p>“This bill enacts provisions related to a state-endorsed digital identity” (SEDI).</p><p>Now it’s off to the governor for signature, who has been publicly positive about it. Huge credit to Sen. Cullimore, the bill’s sponsor, and Christopher Bramwell, the state’s Chief Privacy Officer, who helped draft and guide its content. SB 260 will likely soon become the law in Utah, and with it the possibility of an exciting new era for self-sovereign identity&nbsp;(SSI).</p><p>Passage of SB 260 is the partial realization of a dream I’ve had for more than a dozen years, since co-founding <a href="https://www.evernym.com/">Evernym</a> with Jason Law in 2012. It is not the complete realization of that dream, but it lays the necessary groundwork and carries with it momentum to go the distance over the next few&nbsp;years.</p><p>SB 260 does not call for the creation of a new identity system for the state of Utah — yet — that will be done later, hopefully in next year’s session. This bill establishes the principles Utah politicians stand behind — unanimously — that any future Utah statewide identity system must adhere to. If you are an SSI aficionado, you will recognize and love the principles in this&nbsp;bill.</p> Is State-Endorsed Identity (SEDI) Still&nbsp;SSI? <p>For some in the SSI community, the concept of SSI does not involve a state actor — at&nbsp;all.</p><p>To these SSI purists, SSI becomes trustworthy through a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust">web of trust</a> that replaces the need for a state actor as a root of trust. While theoretically possible — and still a worthwhile end-goal — this ideal vision of SSI isn’t feasible anytime soon. In the meantime, the credibility of government can help accelerate SSI toward an end-goal of not needing government. How? By making ubiquitous the technologies and ceremonies necessary for a web of trust to&nbsp;emerge.</p><p>At the end of the day, if independent control of strong digital identity rests fully with the individual, with no visibility by the state for if, how, or when it is used, then advocates of SSI should be in favor of SSI strengthened by a state endorsement. That is how physical identity works today and how digital identity should work, too. And there’s no reason other, non-government flavors of SSI can’t continue to develop and&nbsp;coexist.</p> State-Endorsed Digital Identity&nbsp;(SEDI) <p>The words “state-endorsed” used throughout this bill carry a lot of meaning; most emerging digital identity systems use the word “issue“ instead of “endorse”. This is a distinction with a profound difference.</p><p>In real life, does a state issue identity or endorse it? When a baby is born, who gives the baby its identifier, its name? The parents do. The state waits for parents to pick a name, puts the name into a certificate, endorses the certificate, then gives it to the parents. Parents determine identity, the state endorses&nbsp;it.</p><p>A couple months ago, a 60 year-old friend of mine decided to change her last name. The decision was hers alone to make, but her new name would not be believable or provable to third parties until she has an endorsement of the new name from the&nbsp;state.</p><p>In real life the state issues credentials, not identity. In this bill Utah acknowledges this reality and explicitly states that individuals first assert identity and only then can the state endorse it. That will be the guardrails for any future state-endorsed digital identity system. (See “<a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/sedi-details-for-identity-nerds-e1949af5cc30">SEDI Details for Identity Nerds</a>” for more&nbsp;info.)</p><p>Through SEDI, SB 260 codifies several foundational SSI principles:</p> Control <p>In lines (65) and (120), it is explicit that the individual is in control of their digital identity.</p> Guardianship &amp; Age Verification <p>Lines (35–40) and (97–98) lay the groundwork for digital guardianship, bringing broad digital capabilities for the first time to dependent populations such as children (including infants), the elderly, disabled persons, homeless persons, and&nbsp;more</p><p>Of particular note in Utah, digital guardianship is how age verification can work for all ages and capabilities, something Utah has been on the forefront of, policy-wise. In the future, guardianship could even work for animals and things,&nbsp;too.</p><p>See “<a href="https://libertas.institute/privacy/finally-a-path-forward-for-online-age-verification/">Finally, a Path Forward for Age Verification</a>” by the Libertas Institute for more info about how SB 260 could facilitate age verification.</p> Privacy &amp; No Surveillance <p>SB 260 is explicit that individuals have the right to not be surveilled. This means that SEDI cannot have any form of “phone home”, which differentiates it from the mobile drivers license (mDL) systems based on ISO 18013, and from the federated identity systems now being implemented in Europe and Australia, which all have inherent phone-home surveillance capabilities.</p><p>In lines (78–79), (84–96), (99–102), (116–117), (122–125), and (128–139) the bill details the principles of privacy and autonomy that must guide any future state-endorsed digital identity system in&nbsp;Utah.</p> State-of-the-Art Security <p>Line (113) stipulates that Utah SEDI must incorporate “state-of-the-art safeguards” for protecting identity. Current industry standards are not good enough, and in fact are unacceptably fragile in my view. My interpretation of “state-of-the-art” means something akin to KERI (Key Event Receipt Infrastructure), where breaches are preventable, detectable, and recoverable in ways that current identity standards cannot do, and which is quantum-resistant. (See the ‘<a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/sedi-details-for-identity-nerds-e1949af5cc30">Details for Nerds</a>’ for more details about security.)</p> Now the Work&nbsp;Begins <p>In some ways SB 260 is the end of a long, hard journey for me, and the partial realization of an audacious dream. In reality it’s one bill, in one state, that establishes the principles and guardrails for a future identity system without creating one&nbsp;today.</p><p>In any case, it’s the closest thing I’ve seen to true self-sovereign identity being officially and legally embraced at a significant level, an entire state of the United States. The next step is far harder: turning concepts into&nbsp;reality.</p><p>Stay tuned.</p><p>For more technical information, see <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/sedi-details-for-identity-nerds-e1949af5cc30">SEDI Details for Identity&nbsp;Nerds</a>.</p>

<p>A few years ago I abandoned Twitter in favor of Mastodon. Recent events validate that choice and underscore the strategic importance of a decentralized fediverse that can’t be owned by a single corporate or state actor. But while Mastodon meets my needs, much of the Twitter diaspora has gone to Bluesky. That’s fine for now but might not always be. In an article titled “Science Must Step Away From Nationally Managed Infrastructure,” Dan Goodman writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Many scientists put huge efforts into building networks to communicate with colleagues and the general public. But all that work and the value in those networks was lost when many scientists felt compelled to leave following Elon Musk’s takeover of the platform (now X). The process of rebuilding on Bluesky is underway, but it will take years and may never reach the same critical mass. Even if the transition is successful, the same thing may happen to Bluesky in a few years.</p></blockquote>
<p>How can we prepare for a future migration from Bluesky to Mastodon? Bridgy Fed — a service that enables you to connect together your website, fediverse account and Bluesky account — will help. But Bridgy Fed needs to be easier to use. So I recruited Claude’s new Sonnet 7 model to do that.</p>

<p>The Pulse is <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/s/the-pulse">a series</a> covering insights, patterns, and trends within Big Tech and startups. Notice an interesting event or trend? <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/contact/">Send me a message</a>.</p><p>Today, we cover:</p>  <p>Industry pulse. Claude Code quietly becoming the best AI coding agent, Microsoft cutting AI data center investment, EA releases Red Alert code, developers don’t want GPUs, DeepSeek keeps open sourcing innovation, and a US DOGE software engineer forgets to make their GitHub account for work private.</p>  <p>Ads startup demands a lot &amp; offers little → struggles to hire. An adtech startup using AI to generate ads seeks a founding engineer who will devote their heart and soul – and most of their awake time – to the company, and is struggling to hire. They’re now offering a $50K (!!) referral bonus. Feels like a classic case of overlooking that hiring is a two-way street: most standout devs don’t want to work 14 hours a day, 7 days a week.</p>  <p>Cloudflare’s self-critical, transparent postmortem. The leading content delivery network recently had its object storage go down for an hour, and only a day later published a detailed incident review, with the CEO personally taking responsibility for fixing the systemic issues which triggered the downtime. Clouflare is a refreshing exception for promptly sharing incident summaries, and showing it’s serious about continuously improving reliability.</p>  <p>More signs of “cutthroat” Big Tech. Google hints at a 60-hour workweek for workers in its AI group, and Meta fires 20 people for leaking internal information.</p>   1. Industry Pulse  Claude Code quietly becoming the best AI coding agent? <p>Anthropic lowkey launched <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview">Claude Code</a>, an agentic coding tool, recently. Feedback I’ve seen from engineers is that the tool is pretty good, with capabilities on par with other AI agents – including Devin (which costs $500/month).</p><p>Until now, Anthropic has built the best LLM for coding (Sonnet 3.5 and Sonnet 3.7). In hindsight, it was only a matter of time until they expanded by building an agentic coding tool that’s at least equal to what other startups offer. After all, most startups will build their agents on top of Sonnet 3.5 or 3.7, as well.</p><p>A criticism is that Claude Code <a href="https://x.com/sirjoeldean/status/1897493893358264453">is expensive</a>, which should not be that surprising because AI agents are much more compute-intensive to run than LLMs. I’ll reserve judgement, Anthropic could turn into a major dev tools company if they keep building AI coding tools like this.</p> Is Microsoft really cutting AI data center investment?

We understand the dangers of concentrated power in the digital age. And we’ve watched in real-time as tech leaders who once championed innovation and openness now actively work to consolidate control and dismantle the very systems that enabled their success.</p><p>[...] What we’re witnessing isn’t just another political cycle or policy debate — it’s an organized effort to destroy the very systems that have made American innovation possible. Whether this is by design, or by incompetence, doesn’t much matter (though it’s likely a combination of both). Unlike typical policy fights where we can disagree on the details while working within the system, this attack aims to demolish the system itself."</p></blockquote><p>I, for one, am grateful for the coverage in places like TechDirt and Wired (which has been killing it lately). I have to say I'm also proud of my journalist colleagues at <a href="https://propublica.org">ProPublica</a> for going deep. I wish most of the rest of the press would take their lead.</p>

Balint is also in tech, but in many ways, is the opposite of me. While I prefer working on backend and business logic, he always thrived in designing and building UIs. While I opted to work at more established companies, he struck out on his own and started his startup, Distinction. And yet, our professional paths have crossed several times: at one point in time I accepted an offer to join Skyscanner as a Principal iOS Engineer – and as part of the negotiation, I added a clause to my contrac that I will not report directly or indirectly to the Head of Mobile: who happened to be my brother, thanks to Skyscanner acquiring his startup the same month that Skyscanner made an offer to hire me.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa58007dd-d7cc-44b8-b233-5bbabe719845_872x572.png">          </a>The Orosz brothers: both of us are working in tech, and have had professional overlaps. Like this podcast episode! <p>Today, Balint is the founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.craft.do/">Craft</a>, a beloved text editor known for its user-friendly interface and sleek design – an app that Apple awarded the prestigious Mac App of the Year in 2021.</p><p>In our conversation, we explore how Balint approaches building opinionated software with an intense focus on user experience. We discuss the lessons he learned from his time building Distinction and working at Skyscanner that have shaped his approach to Craft and its development.</p><p>In this episode, we discuss:</p>  <p>Balint’s first startup, Distinction, and his time working for Skyscanner after they acquired it</p>  <p>A case for a balanced engineering culture with both backend and frontend priorities</p>  <p>Why Balint doesn’t use iOS Auto Layout</p>  <p>The impact of Craft being personal software on front-end and back-end development</p>  <p>The balance between customization and engineering fear in frontend work</p>  <p>The resurgence of local-first software and its role in modern computing</p>  <p>The value of building a physical prototype</p>  <p>How Balint uses GenAI to assist with complicated coding projects</p>  <p>And much more!</p>       Takeaways <p>Design-focused engineers find it harder to fit in. Engineers who focus on backend and distributed systems can usually verbalize their impact clearer, and could see faster career growth – including getting into leadership positions. This creates a reinforcing cycle: as most engineering executives have a backend engineering background: they will recognize and reward backend contributions more.</p><p>Balint didn’t like how he didn’t “fit in” as an engineer focused on design and UI: but he just kept building things he believed in – and years later, building up that “design muscle” helps him build products that backend-focused engineers might struggle in putting together.</p><p>Amazing companies cannot have a single engineering culture. Balint observed how every standout company that has a single engineering culture inherently biases towards either a backend-heavy engineering culture (e.g. Google, Amazon) or a UI-heavy one (Amazon). For a company to be truly standout – more so than these Big Tech giants – it needs to have several engineering cultures: prioritizing both backend and UI excellence. This is what Craft is aiming to do internally.</p><p>To build something better than most other products: you might need to take a different approach. Craft does not use Apple’s UI components: they don’t use SwiftUI or Autolayout – something that 95% or more of iOS apps all take advantage of.</p><p>Craft, instead, built their own components from scratch, and came up with their own layout and animations system. This is a lot more work at first: but it’s how Craft can do smooth animations that most apps are unable to do so – and it’s a reason engineers at Apple have asked the team “how are you able to do such a smooth animation on the navigation bar?” (The native iOS navigation bar cannot be animated like Craft does it) Craft can do all this thanks to building and maintaining their own components. It’s simpler to do than most would assume: in the episode, we look at actual code.</p><p>A shared codebase is an underrated advantage for speed, consistency and efficiency. Craft has a total of 4 engineers building the respective apps for:</p>  <p>iOS</p>  <p>iPad</p>  <p>MacOS</p>  <p>VisionOS</p>  <p>They can do this, because it’s a single codebase! A single codebase also means that all features built on one platform immediately work on all others.</p> The Pragmatic Engineer deepdives relevant for this episode   <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/hackathons">The AI hackathon at Craft Docs</a></p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/engineering-career-paths">Engineering career paths at Big Tech and scaleups</a></p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/thriving-as-a-founding-engineer">Thriving as a Founding Engineer: lessons from the trenches</a></p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-past-and-future-of-backend-practices">The past and future of modern backend practices</a></p>   Timestamps <p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=0s">00:00</a>) Intro</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=133s">02:13</a>) What it’s like being a UX-focused founder</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=540s">09:00</a>) Why it was hard to gain recognition at Skyscanner</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=792s">13:12</a>) Takeaways from Skyscanner that Balint brought to Craft</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=1010s">16:50</a>) How frameworks work and why they aren’t always a good fit</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=1235s">20:35</a>) An explanation of iOS Auto Layout and its pros and cons</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=1393s">23:13</a>) Why Balint doesn’t use Auto Layout</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=1463s">24:23</a>) Why Craft has one code base</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=1666s">27:46</a>) Craft’s unique toolbar features and a behind the scenes peek at the code</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=1995s">33:15</a>) Why frontend engineers have fear around customization</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=2231s">37:11</a>) How Craft’s design system differs from most companies</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=2553s">42:33</a>) Behaviors and elements Craft uses rather than having a system for everything</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=2652s">44:12</a>) The back and frontend architecture in building personal software</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=2891s">48:11</a>) Shifting beliefs in personal computing</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=3015s">50:15</a>) The challenges faced with operating system updates</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=3048s">50:48</a>) The resurgence of local-first software</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=3151s">52:31</a>) The value of opinionated software for consumers</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=3330s">55:30</a>) Why Craft’s focus is on the user’s emotional experience</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=3410s">56:50</a>) The size of Craft’s engineering department and platform teams</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=3560s">59:20</a>) Why Craft moves faster with smaller teams</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=3686s">1:01:26</a>) Balint’s advice for frontend engineers looking to demonstrate value</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=3875s">1:04:35</a>) Balint’s breakthroughs using GenAI</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=4070s">1:07:50</a>) Why Balint still writes code</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=4184s">1:09:44</a>) Rapid fire round</p> A summary of the conversation  Design-first engineering: less recognition?   <p>Balint has been writing code since he was 12. He’s always had a pull towards interactivity, animation, and found himself in the intersection of code and design.</p>  <p>Backend engineering is much easier to quantify than UI/UX work. Balint always felt that backend engineering was easier to quantify in impact – like saving millions in infrastructure costs or scaling to billions of users. How do you quantify that the UI is smooth and delightful?</p>  <p>Balint always felt that "hardcore engineers" did not consider him one of them – as his focus was on UX and UI – like making interactions faster, and animations smoother, and not on distributed systems or scalable algorithms. But designers and product managers also didn’t look at him as equals.</p>  <p>There’s a pull for engineers to move towards the backend and distributed systems. Exactly because these areas are seen as having hard problems to solve and are often more measurable in terms of impact.</p>     Engineering culture at Craft   <p>Craft started off as a text editor for mobile use. When starting to code the product, Balint didn't believe that established engineering patterns, code coverage, or even design components would be the right approach.</p>  <p>Principles in building craft:</p>  <p>Data principles: efficiency and zero data loss are both non-negotiatble. There’s not much to innovate in this area – it’s very well understood! Just refine the existing state of the art.</p>  <p>Fluency. Craft is designed to be used for hours each day, so it needs to feel snappy and fluent.</p>    <p>Having just one engineering culture is not enough. To create an amazing product, you cannot have either frontend or backend engineering principles dominate:</p>  <p>When the dominant engineering culture is UI-first: Apple is a good example. Apple builds delightful user experiences. However, their backend systems and web products are lacking.</p>  <p>When the dominant engineering culture is backend-first: Amazon and Google are good examples. Both focus on system design and backend engineering principles – in return their UIs don't feel as comfortable.</p>    <p>Craft uses the same codebase across 4 platforms: iOS, iPad, MacOS (desktop), and Vision Pro. 99% of the code is common, with some additional native bindings for each platform. Why the same codebase? Balint wanted the desktop app to always do the same thing as the mobile app, and a shared code base was the best way to do it.</p>   Team structure   <p>Craft's product engineering team is around 20 people. This includes product engineering, design, and QA.</p>  <p>They are split into a platform team, which means they have a web team, a native app team, and a backend team. Each of those teams has three to four people.</p>  <p>Balint observed that teams with more than 5 people start to have communications issues</p>   Architecture choices   <p>Prioritize control over abstractions and trends. Using core language patterns and framework elements gives you more control over what you want to do. High-level abstractions and frameworks require more time figuring out the bugs and what those frameworks allow or disallow.</p>  <p>Everything is a canvas. Craft treats everything as a canvas that they draw on. This allows building toolbars that look exactly like a Mac toolbar on the Mac and an iOS toolbar on the iPhone. However, Craft now has more control over these components than if they used the native ones.</p>  <p>Avoiding AutoLayout and SwiftUI. Every time Craft hires a new iOS engineer, the new joiner inevitably asks them why they don't use new technologies like AutoLayout or SwiftUI. Balint shows them one of their transitions and asks them to implement it with the same performance in AutoLayout – and if they can succeed, they’ll move over. So far, no one has managed: but it’s a good exercise to help understand that decisions are not arbitrary, but are following practical purposes.</p>  <p>AutoLayout promises that you no longer need to think in rectangles; you can just say it should be at the top and it can automatically grow. However, when you keep adding more things, the complexity increases and when you want to do something more sophisticated, it can become very performance-intensive.</p>  <p>With AutoLayout, you are trading off easier definition and work as a developer for more complexity on the device and less control when you want to do more advanced animations.</p>       Principles for personal software   <p>“How it makes me feel” matters more. When it comes to personal software, consumers choose a lot more on which one they feel resonates with them. Thus the best personal software is a lot more opinionated than B2B software is</p>  <p>Craft is aiming to build what Visual Studio Code is for engineers – Craft aiming to do the same for knowledge workers. Visual Studio Code feels lightweight and is a fresh breath of air because it's responsive, fast, and does everything you need.</p>  <p>A different take on design systems.</p>  <p>Most companies create an “atomic design system:” starting with base colours as atoms, then buttons that combine colors and shapes as components, and then building up from here.</p>  <p>Craft, instead, has systems for animation. They have an animation engine and library that synchronizes everything across everyone and they enforce usage of that.</p>     A local-first approach   <p>New technologies emerge on the server side. When you're dealing with personal software, the amount of content you're dealing with can fit on the user's device. A lot of the compute can be done locally.</p>  <p>Craft’s architecture is preparing for local-first approaches. They architected components so they can replace them with local or remote components anytime they decide it’s now possible to do so.</p>  <p>An example is search: instead of having a big elastic search cluster, they are looking at having 2 million search indexes on a disk in the cloud. Every time somebody does a search, they can either download that search index locally and use it there to execute the search, or a Lambda or serverless function can just read the search index.</p>    <p>The industry keeps swinging between cloud and local compute.</p>  <p>There is a new wave of personal computing powered by processors getting faster. The M4 Pro is a faster processor than anything you can buy on an AWS cloud.</p>  <p>Eventually, people will get tired of their personal computers holding them back and they’ll appreciate server-side components working faster. After a while, they will then start to get annoyed about how much the server-side project costs… and the pendulum keeps swinging</p>  <p>Local-first is experiencing a comeback because people are starting to travel again. It gets inconvenient when you need something badly, with poor connection – and you cannot access it.</p>    <p>Where to find Balint Orosz:</p><p>• X: <a href="https://x.com/balintorosz">https://x.com/balintorosz</a></p><p>• LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/balintorosz/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/balintorosz/</a></p><p>Mentions during the episode:</p><p>• Craft: <a href="https://www.craft.do/">https://www.craft.do/</a></p><p>• Skyscanner: <a href="https://www.skyscanner.com/">https://www.skyscanner.com/</a></p><p>• Flash: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash</a></p><p>• Shader: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shader">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shader</a></p><p>• Understanding Auto Layout: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AutolayoutPG/index.html">https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AutolayoutPG/index.html</a></p><p>• Mac Catalyst: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/mac-catalyst/">https://developer.apple.com/mac-catalyst/</a></p><p>• Apple M1: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M1">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M1</a></p><p>• Elasticsearch: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticsearch">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticsearch</a></p><p>• The Cloud Is a Prison.

<p>So, yes, hi, I have a Tesla. It’s a long range Model 3 which I bought in 2021.</p><p>After a career spent working on open source and mission-drive projects — right now I work for a non-profit newsroom; once upon a time I built a social networking platform for education — it might shock you to learn that I am not rich. I have never had a significant tech company equity package; I have never seen the benefit of a significant exit. I own my own home but needed to move far away from the Bay Area to do it. I’ve done okay and I’m grateful for the opportunities that I’ve had, but I am not very wealthy. It would be really meaningful for me to bolster my income by another $2K a month and I’ve been thinking a lot about how to do that lately.</p><p>The Tesla has put me in a bit of a weird situation. Even before Elon Musk threw three Hitler salutes on-stage, I couldn’t really afford to own it: the monthly cost is really high for a car that I maybe drive two to three times a week. But selling it is also hard: it’s depreciated really fast, and I’ll barely be able to pay off the loan I have on it. (A lease would have been a better deal.) It actually won’t be that easy for me to get a replacement car, even with a trade-in deal. I’d prefer to keep an electric car — they’re both better environmentally and just as a car to run and own — but we’ll see if that’s possible.</p><p>But I will sell it. Hopefully this month. I don’t want to even tacitly be associated with promoting that man or bolstering his wealth. Until then, I’ve become one of those people who has disclaimered his car, so anyone who sees it is under no impression that I am in favor of anything that’s happening in this country right now.</p><p>One sticker I don’t have: the one that says I bought this before Elon went crazy. There’s no such thing. The warning signs were always there; my car situation is a prime example of how ignoring these kinds of ethical red flags lead to real losses in the long run. I brought this on myself.</p><p>I know I’m not alone. Not everyone who owns one of these things is a wealthy Musk supporter. That doesn’t mean we should be absolved — we should have seen what we were getting into, and owning a Tesla does mean continuing to pay Musk, who is clearly a fascist, money through connectivity plans and so on — but it’s worth acknowledging that, for many people, it’s not a no-brainer to take this kind of financial hit.</p><p>Anyway, that’s the deal. I guess I’m posting this out of a sense of transparency, and a little bit out of a sense of exasperation at my own past purchasing decisions and the overwhelmingly bad present situation. Many of you will be judging me for this, and I both accept and deserve that. But here I am.</p>

<p>Hi – this is Gergely with the monthly, free issue of the Pragmatic Engineer Newsletter. In every issue, I cover challenges at Big Tech and startups through the lens of engineering managers and senior engineers. If you’ve been forwarded this email, you can <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/about">subscribe here</a>.</p><p>The most-frequently cited article I’ve ever written is still <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/software-engineering-salaries-in-the-netherlands-and-europe/">The trimodal nature of software engineering salaries in the Netherlands and Europe</a> – which is a deepdive published back in 2021. At the time, I had recently left my engineering manager job at Uber, and was trying to understand how tech compensation really works. At Uber in Amsterdam, I saw that comp for senior software engineering positions was 2-5x higher than for most “local” senior roles. </p><p>To find out why this gap exists, I gathered hundreds of data points and talked with dozens of recruiters and managers; was this comp gap a symptom of “bimodal” distribution, as Daan Luu <a href="https://danluu.com/bimodal-compensation/?ref=blog.pragmaticengineer.com">posted</a> in 2016? After researching, I felt confident enough to say that tech compensation in the Netherlands and Europe was trimodal:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3b8ae313-ab32-494a-abac-728b3b895ff6_1456x1031.png">          </a>High-level overview. “$X” varies per country and region, but trends are international <p>Last year, we returned to this topic in <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/trimodal-nature-of-tech-compensation">The Trimodal nature of tech compensation revisited</a>, which validated the distribution by using more than 1,000 data points from the Dutch market, and quotes from engineering leaders and software engineers in the US, UK, Canada, and Japan, which suggested that a “trimodal” model is real. Even so, this was partly anecdotal and in need of hard data to confirm it.</p><p>Today, we finally have the numbers, thanks to the <a href="https://www.levels.fyi/?compare=Booking.com,ING,Miro&amp;track=Software%20Engineer">Levels.fyi</a> team,, and this article dives into the findings by region, covering:</p>  <p>US: entry-level software engineers. Categorizing the three tiers of compensation bands, based on 5,601 data points.</p>  <p>US: senior software engineers. More Tier 2 and 3 offers are at least twice as big as the Tier 1 median, based on 9,509 data points.</p>  <p>Best-paying US companies by tier. Hedge funds, top scaleups, and Big Tech lead the pack – with companies like Roku, MongoDB and Dropbox also ranking high.</p>  <p>UK numbers, tiers, and best-paying companies. Hedge funds and finance companies lead, with Stripe, Confluent, and BP also making it to the top 10, based on 6,219 data points.</p>  <p>India numbers and tiers. Rippling, Stripe, Uber, Coinbase, Atlassian, Broadcom, and LinkedIn, offer ₹1 crore-or-above packages for senior engineers ($118K and up), based on 2,078 data points</p>  <p>Note on equity. Startups and scaleups may offer more in total compensation than publicly traded companies, but equity in not-yet-public companies comes with risk.</p>  <p>The data on the US, UK, and India reveals a complex regional picture united by a trimodal model. See below:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae2bd5fc-3935-41ba-843b-37fadfed5fa5_1616x780.png">          </a>Three “tiers” in the US data.

They offer <a href="https://levels.fyi/services/resume/">resume review</a> and<a href="https://levels.fyi/services/"> salary negotiation services</a> with Big Tech recruiters. A neat feedback loop of this is that information from their salary negotiation services helps the team ensure that submitted data really is valid. Levels.fyi also has a<a href="https://levels.fyi/jobs"> job board</a> and provides <a href="https://www.levels.fyi/offerings/data/">compensation benchmarking services</a> for businesses.</p><p>Some stats about Levels.fyi:</p>  <p>2.5 million visitors per month</p>  <p>20,000 new data points added per month, on average</p>  <p>$100M: total value of increased comp offers achieved with its <a href="https://www.levels.fyi/services/reviews.html">compensation negotiation service</a> – not including raises negotiated by candidates using the site ad-hoc for comparison.</p>  <p>A team of 13 people is behind the site and app, and I recently grabbed coffee with several of them in San Francisco.</p><p>This article covers “total compensation” (TC), not only salary. TC includes all forms of annual comp:</p>  <p>Base salary</p>  <p>Cash bonus, or the cash bonus target of companies that share this information</p>  <p>Value of equity vested</p>  <p>For example, a $300K TC package might look like this:</p>  <p>$175K base salary</p>  <p>Plus $25K target bonus</p>  <p>Plus $100K in equity vesting over the first year (typically $400K vested over 4 years, with $100K vesting each year)</p>  <p>Equity is a tricky topic but also a key one, more on which is in the “Note on equity” section near the foot of this article.</p> 1. US: entry-level software engineers <p>Let’s start with entry-level software engineer offers submitted to <a href="http://levels.fyi">Levels.fyi</a> in the past year for the world’s biggest tech market. Here’s how these data points were filtered:</p>  <p>“Software Engineer” submissions</p>  <p>Offer date between 1 Jan 2024 and 1 Jan 2025</p>  <p>Years of experience: between 0 and 2</p>  <p>Region: US</p>  <p>Years at company: 0. This means we look at new offers, not existing employees’ comp changes at their current workplaces</p>  <p>We have 5,601 entry-level US data points after applying the filters. A visualization:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F438d619b-ea5d-4ffa-9f45-290c98d2537e_1600x732.png">          </a>5,601 entry-level software engineering offers in the US, visualized <p>At first sight, this distribution fits what looks more like a bimodal distribution, with a first peak at $100-110k, and a second peak at $170-180k:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1197426d-ef54-4132-8a9c-0515fde40d78_1600x796.png">          </a>Comp distribution has twin “local maximum” peaks <p>However, after sifting through the data and manually tagging companies by common traits, we find the data organizes itself differently. The chart below takes the same data and organizes it based on the assumption behind the original trimodal distribution: that companies compensate based on the market they compete in. We use three categories of business type:</p>  <p>Big Tech. Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Netflix, alongside publicly traded, large tech companies competing with them, like Uber, Snap, and Pinterest</p>  <p>Top scaleups and hedge funds. Late-stage startups backed by well-known VCs that have not gone public, or IPOed only very recently. Plus hedge funds, and quantitative trading firms (quant)</p>  <p>Everyone else. startups, privately owned companies, and “traditional” ones</p>  <p>Here’s how the same data looks when broken down into these categories:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb0d0b53d-b55e-493d-852a-a4c2e8618e20_1600x732.png">          </a>Segmenting the data by three tiers <p>Now, let’s check each segment.</p> Tier 1: Everyone else <p>This category consists mainly of companies competing for local talent, which often are not driven by their engineering talent or digital products.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb1be272-60b0-448c-b6c8-c1b56bd9f6c9_1600x732.png">          </a>Distribution of the “everyone else” category: 3,262 data points (58% of total). Median: $105K, 75th percentile: $130K <p>This resembles the lowest tier (“Tier 1”) of the trimodal model. It’s interesting how drastically the distribution changes by removing Big Tech, top scaleup, and hedge fund data points!</p> Tier 2: Big Tech  <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffad56830-433d-4e87-963c-4aaf176f45ab_1600x732.png">          </a>Big Tech. 1,914 data points (34% of all data). Median: $180K, 75th percentile: $203K <p>The largest publicly traded tech companies compensate engineers with increasingly large equity packages up the career ladder. I split this category for two reasons:</p>  <p>Commonly referenced. The terms “FAANG” and “Big Tech” are frequently their own category, and benchmarks for other companies’ offers.</p>  <p>Industry-leading comp. It’s hard to find bigger liquid compensation offers than this group offers. Later, we see it’s possible to win higher illiquid comp offers at not-yet-public scaleups, and some hedge funds can top what Big Tech offers.</p>   Tier 3: Top scaleups and hedge funds  <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65758d28-0944-460c-aa01-56e391374a90_1600x732.png">          </a>Top scaleups and hedge funds, based on 493 data points (8% of all data). Median: $208K, 75th percentile: $247K <p>This is a very interesting category with a lack of high-quality data, outside of Levels.fyi, for two reasons:</p><p>Private scaleups issue not-yet-liquid equity. Many assume Big Tech companies offer the most, compensation-wise. And this is true in terms of liquid equity; shares that can be sold for cash is an area where Big Tech is near-impossible for scaleups to match.</p><p>However, top-tier startups and scaleups can – and do – offer more total compensation than Big Tech. But there’s a catch: their equity cannot be sold until a liquidity event happens like an IPO, or stock buyback. Scaleups which out-offer Big Tech in total comp include <a href="https://www.levels.fyi/companies/databricks/salaries">Databricks</a> and <a href="https://www.levels.fyi/companies/openai/salaries">OpenAI</a>.</p><p>It makes sense for late-stage scaleups to make bigger total comp offers than Big Tech because they target the same talent and must compensate for the fact their equity grants are illiquid, and may not become convertible to cash any time soon. Plus, there’s also the risk of a grant losing value like at Foursquare, where employees’ stock options <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/the-private-tech-company-that-let-employee-stock-grants-evaporate">ended up as worthless</a>.</p><p>Hedge funds are notoriously secretive. Places like <a href="https://www.levels.fyi/companies/two-sigma/salaries">Two Sigma</a> want to keep their compensation details as confidential as possible. Levels.fyi has accurate data points, but not enough to make this group into its own category. So, they’re included with scaleups here.</p><p>The compensation philosophy of hedge funds is very different than at Big Tech and scaleups:</p>  <p>No equity: hedge funds do not issue equity, even though this element is almost always what makes Big Tech and scaleup compensation packages standout</p>  <p>Large cash bonuses: instead, hedge funds award hefty end-of-year bonuses, of up to 100% of annual salary. Hedge funds are the only category of company offering more liquid compensation than Big Tech and some scaleups. At the same time, hedge funds hire a lot less frequently</p>   Overlapping categories <p>Let’s look at all three categories of employer in a single graph:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fda2b5d-8bfd-4896-83ba-789ac92258e9_1600x798.png">          </a>All entry-level compensation data points, split into categories <p>And also let’s check out the median and 75th percentile total compensation packages of each category:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70750922-ac38-4b5b-9ff5-be4ca13f1b1d_1236x684.png">          </a>Data points for each category <p>There are a few interesting points about this distribution:</p>  <p>~2x difference between Tier 1 and 3. Tier 2 and 3 companies pay around 2x as much at the 50th and 75th percentiles than Tier 1 does. Tier 2 (Big Tech) is a lot closer to Tier 3 in TC. The 75th percentile of Tier 1 still doesn’t come close to the 50th percentile of Tier 2</p>  <p>Overlap from Tier 1 into Tier 2. The highest Tier 1 offers – at around the 90th-95th percentiles – do reach up to $200K, which is near the median range of tiers 2 and 3</p>  <p>Tiers 2 and 3 overlap a lot. The only real difference between Tier 2 and Tier 3 is that there are much more Big Tech data points in the sample. This could indicate a bias in user submissions towards Big Tech, or that scaleups and hedge funds hire far fewer entry-level engineers in the US</p>   2. US: senior software engineers <p>Compensation differences tend to grow with seniority, so let’s look at senior-and-above software engineers by adjusting the filters:</p>  <p>“Software Engineer” submissions</p>  <p>Offer date in the last 3 years (between 1 Jan 2022 and 1 Jan 2025)</p>  <p>Experience: 5 years minimum</p>  <p>Region: US</p>  <p>Years at company: 0. Similar to before, we only look at new offers</p>  <p>Let’s see how the same three categories map when looking at senior software engineers, split across the same tiers:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F800a878e-7f2b-4f3b-952e-a6999b896182_1600x775.png">          </a>All senior-and-above engineer compensation data points by category. Total number of data points: 9,509 <p>Here’s what these tiers look like in the median and 75th percentile compensation bands:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b63cf3a-9661-4065-b7e7-2e4742fee6db_1230x658.png">          </a>Data points for each category <p>The tiers are more distinct for seniors than for entry-level engineers. Some observations:</p>  <p>Tier 1 (everyone else): this category has the most data points (53% of the total). Also, while the median of this tier is significantly below the other two categories, there is overlap at the 75th and 90th percentiles. Simply put, it’s possible to earn as much in this group as in Big Tech, but it’s harder to do.</p>  <p>Tier 2 (Big Tech): compensation spread is very wide, starting from around $100K, all the way to $600K and above. This indicates the median value is less important, and things like career level, the specific company, and negotiation, could all matter more.</p>  <p>Tier 3 (top scaleups and hedge funds): this overlaps with Big Tech, and its top end goes even further. Also, there is far less data for this category, suggesting that these companies hire significantly fewer staff than Big Tech does, as mentioned above.</p>  <p>Outliers: these are much more distinct at the senior level, compared to the entry-level tier distribution</p>  <p>Big Tech and scaleups+hedge funds have many outliers. The median entry-level Tier 1 compensation package was $105K – and there were few offers in tiers 2 and 3 that offered twice as much ($200K and above.) The median senior Tier 1 compensation was $180K, but now there are far more offers in tiers 1 and 2 worth double that ($350K and above). Visualized:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcab84ecd-d8e2-4622-bc71-a4c44fbeab5a_739x712.png">          </a>A higher percentage of people reported making at least double in Tier 1 median compensation at senior level, than at entry-level. Being in the “long tail” of offers could be more achievable at senior level than at entry-level  3. US companies paying highest by tier <p>With the data below, we look at the number of senior software engineer submissions and filter them for offers submitted by engineers with 5-10 years of experience.</p> Tier 1: “everyone else” <p>The highest median total compensation offers in this category were made by the companies listed below:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84450c93-8d85-45ba-9b18-77bf1b6ae92f_1316x1298.png">          </a>Companies offering the highest 50th percentile compensation in the “everyone else” category <p>Leading employers in this category are <a href="https://www.levels.fyi/companies/indeed/salaries">Indeed</a>, <a href="https://www.levels.fyi/companies/hubspot/salaries">HubSpot</a>, <a href="https://www.levels.fyi/companies/workday/salaries">Workday</a>, <a href="https://www.levels.fyi/companies/disney/salaries">Disney</a>, <a href="https://www.levels.fyi/companies/ebay/salaries/software-engineer?country=254">eBay</a>, <a href="https://www.levels.fyi/companies/capital-one/salaries">Capital One</a>, <a href="https://www.levels.fyi/companies/goldman-sachs/salaries">Goldman Sachs</a>, <a href="https://www.levels.fyi/companies/jpmorgan-chase/salaries">JPMorgan Chase</a> and <a href="https://www.levels.fyi/companies/visa/salaries">Visa</a>.</p><p>Which businesses in each tier are most worth targeting for jobseekers?

It feels like two tiers might be coupled here, based on the midpoint of the graph having several local maximums: £100K ($126K), around £125K ($158K), and circa £150K ($190K). I’d assume that if we split up Big Tech, the top scaleups+hedge funds, and everyone else, we’d see two distinct tiers. Still, it is US-HQ’d companies that offer the most comp to senior software engineers.</p>  <p>Like the US, the UK has hedge funds that offer as much – or more – than Big Tech. These firms are all based in London, often with offices in New York. This is the first time I’ve seen it broken down like this.</p>  <p>UK, but not US or UK-headquartered, are similar. The medians and 75th percentiles of these categories are almost the same. Non-US, non-UK HQed companies simply have fewer data points.</p>  <p>The data is likely to overrepresent US-HQ’d companies. It would seem there are more US-based companies employing software engineers in the UK, than UK-headquartered ones do. However, based on my understanding of the market this is incorrect: in reality, a lot more UK-based companies employ software engineers than US-based ones, but the data currently biases towards US-HQ’d companies.</p>  <p>My sense is that for the UK, the real three tiers are those <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/trimodal-nature-of-tech-compensation">previously discussed</a>:</p>  <p>Tier 1: local market, meaning most UK HQ’d companies</p>  <p>Tier 2: startups and scaleups targeting the top of the local market. Many are likely US-based, but not competing with Big Tech</p>  <p>Tier 3: Big Tech and top scaleups competing with them</p>  <p>Here are companies offering the highest median total compensation in the UK:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c04fc45-ee3e-4dea-9cdd-61130184e749_1344x1318.png">          </a>Companies offering the highest 50th percentile compensation in the UK.

As in the UK, India has more local companies based in the country and employing software engineers. For example, Tata Consultancy services <a href="https://www.nucamp.co/blog/coding-bootcamp-india-ind-top-10-tech-companies-to-work-for-in-india-in-2025">alone employs</a> more than 600,000 IT professionals – many of them software engineers. And we’ve not covered large employers like Infosys, or Wipro. At the same time, data from Levels.fyi is biased towards US-HQ’d companies: 77% of all data points. You can help the data become more accurate by <a href="https://www.levels.fyi/salaries/add">submitting your compensation</a>.</p>  <p>India-HQ’d companies rarely offer standout compensation. As per this data, it is mostly companies headquartered abroad that offer above $100K in total compensation (₹87 lakhs or more).</p>  <p>US-HQ’d companies pay very well. While the median compensation for these companies is $63K (₹52 lakh,) the 90th percentile is at $133K (₹1.1 crore!) This is surprisingly high!</p>  <p>Big Tech offers are very strong. A select few senior+ engineers can make in the range of $200K per year (₹1.7 crore) at the very top of the range, which is close to 4x the median compensation of the India-HQ’d tier.</p>   <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7b77a748-690a-45ed-8c8f-05458ea79ec1_1292x800.png">          </a>Data points for each category <p>Companies that pay the most in India, as per the data:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0926dc9a-1696-4fce-9fb2-aeb1acebf097_1312x1274.png">          </a>Companies offering top 50th percentile comp in India <p>One surprise is Google not making the top 10; it comes in at number 14 overall, with median senior engineer compensation at $98K (₹85 lakh) – not far away from the top 10. One thing to keep in mind is that Google has the most data points of companies, meaning it might be more accurate.</p><p>Businesses with the most data points submitted in India:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7954273d-dcb5-4b16-8c27-f9c155db5d45_1258x1200.png">          </a>Companies with the most compensation packages submitted to Levels.fyi  6. Note on equity <p>The bigger a Big Tech or VC-funded startup comp package is, the larger the share of equity. For example, here’s a visualization of the comp split for senior software engineers in the US, over the past year:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe2748274-0075-438e-9f2e-1adf5d506f66_1600x655.png">          </a>Visualizing the TC split of engineers. The higher the TC, the bigger the equity and cash bonus, compared to base salary. Based on 796 data points <p>You might wonder how the largest packages have no equity component and a very large cash bonus. It’s because these are hedge funds which don’t issue equity and award cash bonuses of nearly 2x the annual salary.</p><p>Non-liquid equity comes with additional risk. Let’s take two compensation packages: one with a TC of $475K, and one with $423K. Which is better? It seems like $475K is clearly bigger, but some extra context is needed. The $240K package is from Rippling, a scaleup that is not yet publicly traded:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3443bf37-4796-47bd-ab75-11cd6011c56b_1600x398.png">   </a>A $475K package at Rippling.

See the <a href="https://www.levels.fyi/offer/ab7e12f5-7427-41e4-95a6-2169de3a477b">original submission</a> <p>The big difference between them is that at Uber, an engineer can sell their stock as soon as it vests, (usually, quarterly) if they wish. By doing so, they earn $423K worth of liquid compensation in the first year. At Rippling, the liquid compensation will be $335K ($240K in base salary and $85K bonus target), and equity can only be sold if and when a liquidity event occurs, such as:</p>  <p>Rippling organizes a secondary offer and allows employees to sell some stock. This usually happens with oversubscribed fundraising events</p>  <p>Rippling goes public. In this case, employees can sell their vested stock after a lockup period of around 6 months</p>  <p>Rippling is acquired and the buyer pays for employees’ stocks</p>  <p>For private companies, the big questions are when will equity become liquid, and how much will it be worth.</p><p>It’s worth remembering stock prices change, which makes equity compensation volatile. In 2022, we covered how <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/51386866/stock-price-woes-and-attrition">this can lead to compensation woes</a>. At the time, tech stocks like Stitch Fix, Redfin, and Zoom, dropped 50-80% in 12 months. At the same time, companies like NVIDIA, Tesla, and Apple, saw 50-100% stock price growth. Compensation packages for people working in the former group dropped significantly, while the latter group saw major increases. A $350K TC package became worth $510K at NVIDIA, and $231K at Stitch Fix:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa0aeae87-2faa-4e54-ae42-ad1c0cf892be_1244x1344.png">          </a>Equity can be volatile, and equity-heavy packages similarly so.

It’s enabled us to visualize compensation distribution and tiers across international labor markets.</p><p>Levels.fyi gives free access to its compensation data points, and relies on users sharing their comp numbers. If you’ve gotten value out of this article, please consider <a href="https://www.levels.fyi/salaries/add">submitting the comp details of your current position</a>; this lets the site provide fresh, data-backed insights, like in this deepdive.</p><p>My biggest takeaways:</p><p>The US is unique in having a tier above Big Tech. Across the UK, India, and in the Netherlands, the highest compensation tier (Tier 3) is Big Tech. So it’s a surprise to learn there’s an even higher tier that exists only in the US. Hedge funds, quant firms, and top scaleups can pay more than the likes of Google, Meta, Amazon, Netflix, Apple, etc, with two important caveats:</p>  <p>At top scaleups, bigger-than-Big-Tech comp packages are usually reserved for workers already in Big Tech, who would not switch jobs for an illiquid TC package unless it exceeds their current, liquid one.</p>  <p>Hedge funds and quant firms seem like a different world. Switching between Big Tech and these companies looks harder to do, and happens less often than moving between Big Tech and scaleups.</p>  <p>US-HQ’d companies tend to pull up markets outside the US. Among tier 3 companies <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/trimodal-nature-of-tech-compensation">in the Netherlands</a>, 95% of those which I know are US-headquartered, and the data shows this is also the case in the UK and India.</p><p>Higher-tier companies come with downsides. These workplaces pay more, but usually operate with a <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/what-silicon-valley-gets-right-on-software-engineers/">“Silicon Valley-style” engineering culture</a>: they expect a lot more in terms of autonomy, taking on product, DevOps, and testing work, and working longer hours – especially when collaborating with overseas teams. Adjusting to this can be tough if you’ve never worked in such an environment. Vice-versa, it can also be challenging to swap this pattern for a more traditional, hierarchical workplace.</p><p>Meanwhile, work stress can actually be higher at Tier 2 and Tier 3 companies, as covered in <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/146208867/tier-and-realities">part 2 of the Trimodal series</a>.</p><p>Today’s job market is a lot tougher than previously, and it’s harder to get into top-tier companies. In this deepdive, we’ve looked closely at the top tiers across several markets. With the job market tightening up, there are more qualified candidates than ever, and this can affect the size of offers. So, if you’re in the job market, I would not treat the numbers in this article as concrete and immovable. Instead, just focus on performing well in interviews, and getting an offer. Then these figures might be helpful in the negotiation phase.</p><p>Compensation is not everything; it’s just what is easiest to measure and make comparisons with, but there’s more to a job than the pay alone. Here’s what I used to think matters:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f501119-12dd-476d-ab9f-d9314a161099_1364x860.png">          </a>A way to think about a career <p>But is this all there is?

<p></p><p>Much of the last decade or two of the tech industry has been dominated by the idea of&nbsp;the cloud: the simple, powerful idea that all of your applications and data can be accessed from any device with an internet connection. Enterprise businesses around the world have decommissioned server rooms in favor of subscribing to services maintained by other people, reducing overheads of all kinds. Even companies that once built and operated vast datacenters now rely on cloud providers. At the same time, cloud services have helped individuals save money upfront (even if subscriptions often cost more in the long run) and have taken the need for installation and troubleshooting out of the picture. Overall, cloud services have saved lots of people huge amounts of time and money.</p><p>But this convenience comes with trade-offs, some of which have become more apparent over time.</p>  You only ever rent: There’s no real ownership, and vendors can modify, discontinue, or increase prices at will. 
 Privacy concerns: Because your data and activity pass through the provider’s infrastructure, they can be easily monitored, tracked, or even resold. 
 Jurisdictional constraints: Your data often resides in the provider’s chosen region, subjecting it to local laws, which may not align with your needs. 
 Downtime and dependence: If your cloud provider goes down, so does your access — sometimes across multiple services. 
 Vendor lock-in: Moving away from a cloud provider can be complex and expensive, discouraging competition and user control. 
 <p>These trade-offs become even riskier when your work involves sensitive information. When software and infrastructure are controlled by the same entity, it not only enables easy monitoring and resale of your data but also makes it a prime target for subpoenas. Courts can compel a cloud service provider to produce your data, often without your involvement.</p><p>If your work involves sensitive personal information, for example of patients or sources, that could put their privacy and safety at risk. That might be particularly problematic in a situation where, for example, you work on reproductive health issues, and your software is hosted in a jurisdiction that has abortion bans. This risk extends across professions: journalists protecting sources, lawyers safeguarding client data, and healthcare providers managing patient records all face heightened exposure when their software, data, and infrastructure are all controlled by the same party.</p><p>At the same time, moving away from the convenience of the cloud is not really an option for most organizations. To date, most have opted to pay for more expensive enterprise contracts, which promise greater data protections alongside features like stronger audit logs and SSO. These provide some legal protections, but still amount to little more than an enforced promise: the vendor physically can inspect your data in most cases, you’re just paying them extra so that they’ll promise not to. These contracts also don’t address jurisdictional issues: if the vendor is based in Texas, your use of their platform is still subject to Texan law. The power dynamics at play remain unaddressed.</p><p>This is also problematic when you consider the increasing popularity of LLMs. If you’re dealing with sensitive or proprietary information, you probably don’t want an AI model to be trained on your data. You can pay vendors like OpenAI to promise that they won’t look at your data or train their models on it — but, again, you need to take their word for it.</p><p>If we want to retain the benefits of cloud software without its fundamental risks, we need a different model: one that restores control to users and organizations rather than vendors.</p>  Retain the ease of deployment, access, and collaboration that makes cloud software so appealing. 
 De-couple software and infrastructure so that the company making the software is not the company that hosts the software. 
 Allow customers to pick an infrastructure host in the jurisdiction of their choice. 
 Ensure that data is encrypted at rest and in transit, so that even the hosting provider cannot access it. 
 <p>Self-hosted cloud software is, of course, absolutely a thing that already exists. Some of it is even end-to-end encrypted. But it’s also largely free and open source, and requires a fair amount of configuration and maintenance from an organization’s IT department. There’s nothing wrong with open source software (I ran two open source startups!), but the complexity of configuration and lack of clear business model can introduce problems for both the customer and the vendor. Vendors like <a href="https://www.cloudron.io/">Cloudron</a> are making this easier for open source software — and they should serve as a model for what could come next.</p><p>Some cloud infrastructure providers, like AWS, already host marketplaces of software you can install. The trick is, you usually have to decide which kinds of virtual servers to use — are you going to go for an m3.medium or a t2.xlarge? — and then consider how your private cloud will be configured. AWS also offers self-hosting for LLM models through Amazon Bedrock, but the same problems present themselves. There’s a lot of technical overhead which many organizations can’t easily address — and in stark contrast to a cloud offering like Google Workspace, which is completely turn-key.</p><p>But this doesn’t have to be the case. What if we could combine the ease of cloud-based software with the control and flexibility of locally managed applications?</p><p>Consider an iPhone: here, your software runs on your device, wherever it might be, but is seamlessly downloaded from an App Store on demand. Some of that software is free; some of it is paid-for, either as a one-off or on a subscription basis. The underlying operating system is a variant of the FreeBSD UNIX system with significant proprietary additions, including some sophisticated sandboxing, but you wouldn’t know it, and you certainly don’t need to configure anything: you request an app, and zip!, there it is on your phone.</p><p>Consider this user journey:</p>  The customer signs up to a certified provider in the jurisdiction of their choice. There are providers tailored for different levels of customer and different industries. 
 They add their payment information. 
 They choose the software they want to provide to their organization from an App Store accessed through the provider. As soon as they install it, it is near-instantly available to them. 
 They can make it available to every user in their organization or a subset of users. 
 For every user for whom it is available, the app shows up on a web-based dashboard. It can also be configured to automatically show up in providers like Okta. 
 They never have to care about the speed or capacity of the underlying hardware: they just pay for a recurring license to the software. 
 They never have to care about configuring or upgrading the software: as soon as they select it, it’s available. Customers can opt for updates to be pushed out automatically, or they can hold back non-security updates for more testing. 
 <p>The App Store distributes revenue to the vendor and the hosting provider, and takes a cut for itself. Apps are charged for on a predictable, monthly, per-seat basis, with each app able to set its own prices. As is the case with a phone App Store, the store itself does some vetting of each application, certifying it for security and a set of core rules that each app must abide by. Unlike a phone App Store, it also does vetting and certification of the hosting provider itself, reducing the customer’s need to undertake security auditing.</p><p>Because every hosting provider associated with an App Store would necessarily need to adhere to the same open standards, the customer could move providers easily. They’d just sign up to another hosting provider associated with the App Store and migrate their apps. The App Store itself would handle the rest, dealing with migrating block storage, databases, and so on behind the scenes.</p><p>This model isn’t just about redistributing power from giant cloud vendors to customers. It’s about enabling organizations that deal with sensitive data to more easily use the cloud to begin with. It makes it easier to know that there is an enforced separation between an LLM and its training infrastructure. And it creates new opportunities for vendors that might not be in a position to offer their own cloud infrastructure, too. It lowers the barrier to both privacy and innovation for everyone involved.</p><p>Existing cloud providers aren’t incentivized to build this. It’ll take a new entrant or someone willing to make a big bet. The technology to do this already exists. The only question is: who will build it first?</p><p>If it’s you, I’d love to hear from you.</p>

<p>Emil Lundberg and I have published the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-lundberg-cose-two-party-signing-algs/">COSE Algorithms for Two-Party Signing</a> specification.  Its abstract is:</p>
<blockquote><p>
This specification defines COSE algorithm identifiers used when the signing operation is performed cooperatively between two parties. When performing two-party signing, the first party typically hashes the data to be signed and the second party signs the hashed data computed by the first party. This can be useful when communication with the party holding the signing private key occurs over a limited-bandwidth channel, such as NFC or Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), in which it is infeasible to send the complete set of data to be signed. The resulting signatures are identical in structure to those computed by a single party, and can be verified using the same verification procedure without additional steps to preprocess the signed data.
</p></blockquote>
<p>A motivating use case for this is for WebAuthn/FIDO2 Authenticators to use when signing application data, as described in the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/webauthn/pull/2078">proposed WebAuthn signing extension</a>.  Parts of this spec’s content were previously in the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-bradleylundberg-cfrg-arkg/">Asynchronous Remote Key Generation (ARKG) algorithm</a> spec, which we’ve also been updated.</p>
<p>I plan to talk about the spec during <a href="https://www.ietf.org/meeting/122/">IETF 122 in Bangkok</a>.  I hope to see many of you there!</p>
<p>The specification is available at:</p>

Symbolic representation of Web Security applied to&nbsp;SSI.<p>Many children in Europe grew up with the tales of Baron Münchhausen, who claims to have lifted himself and his horse out of a mire by pulling his own hair. The image is so powerful because the problem of the circular dependency is so clearly visible. In real life, circular dependencies are often far less&nbsp;obvious.</p><p>Which is why the <a href="https://ggreve.medium.com/self-sovereign-identity-over-before-it-started-661b4b0dbdc6">first article</a> in this series was primarily focused on looking behind the SSI smoke and mirrors around Web based identifiers and communication protocols. The resulting discussions in the <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/">Rebooting the Web Of Trust (RWOT)</a> community were quite enlightening, and included a deeper look at the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/EUDIGITALIDENTITYWALLET/Technical+Specifications">EU Digital Identity Wallet Technical specifications</a>.</p><p>One of the mirrors basically broke when claims of OpenID4VC supporting decentralized identifiers were shattered when someone pointed out that while the EU Wallet is marketed on digital sovereignty and privacy, but in reality does not <a href="https://github.com/openid/federation-wallet/issues/43#issuecomment-2539862593">does not allow decentralized identifiers</a>:</p>The current EUDI approach: No decentralized identifiers allowed<p>So while it was clear that OpenID4VC and did:web* do not qualify as decentralized, Self-Sovereign Identity, some people advocated to just embrace the false marketing in the hope that it would create wider acceptance and the appearance of adoption for&nbsp;SSI.</p><p>But has that approach ever really&nbsp;worked?</p><p>More often this kind of “sovereignwashing” appears to run a high risk of creating false expectations, disappointment. Which would ultimately cement the status quo of the federated platform identity lock-in for the next 20 years. As a community we should focus on building actual decentralized identifiers, communication protocols, and applications.</p><blockquote>Because the true social and economic value of SSI is not just in the identity layer itself, it is in the decentralized applications enabled as a&nbsp;result.</blockquote><p>Some of which would be in direct competition to the champions of the platform age, who are investing their financial and political capital into OpenID4VC and Web based identifiers to prevent that competition from ever getting off the ground. A classic “old industry vs new technologies” battle.</p><p>There are real opportunity costs across most of economy and society if the old encumbents manage to postpone or kill innovation.</p>Symbolic representation of eIDAS 2.0 after successful lobbying by the platforms and trust intermediaries Security and privacy for a globally networked society <p>Technology and corresponding security have been head to head in a special kind of race for a long time, dating back to an Egyptian inscription around 1900 BC in the main chamber of the tomb of Khnumhotep II, over Julius Caesar using a ROT-3 cypher in 100 BC, all the way to the famous Enigma machine used in World War II. The more people potentially had access to a message, the harder the encryption had to&nbsp;become.</p><p>The encryption used by Julius Caesar was not particularly strong, because it relied on a supposedly secret algorithm. Once parties know the secret, encryption and decryption become trivial. Over time this moved to well-known algorithms using shared secrets. And even though the shared secrets are more complex on today’s internet, this fundamental principle hasn’t&nbsp;changed:</p><blockquote>If you know the shared secret, and can intercept the encrypted message, you will be able to read, and also impersonate and falsify communication.</blockquote><p>In contrast, Engima was quite strong for its day because it combined a rotating cypher with a codebook that was famously carried by U-Boats allowing them to choose the correct settings. Literally handed over to the commander of the boat by hand in a secure location before departure, these code books effectively represented a cryptographic key, shared over a second channel — the physical handover.</p><p>Which makes any well-designed encryption system almost impossible to break. Unless, of course, you have intimate knowledge of the inner workings of the rotating cypher, and can guess certain messages, like weather reports, to then use brute force to arrive back at the settings for the day. Those settings then allowed to read other messages, which would otherwise have been unbreakable.</p>Digital identity should be based on an&nbsp;advance<p>In other words: The cryptography of the Enigma machine itself was solid, and essentially unbroken. But the Allied Forces were able to exploit structural weaknesses designed into the operation of Engima to attack the key generation for the&nbsp;day.</p> Security in Swiss Healthcare <p>That particular race accelerated when the Internet was born. In 1996, when the internet was still young, the US Congress deliberated and passed the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). That same year, the <a href="https://www.fmh.ch/">Swiss Medical Association (FMH)</a>, realized patient data had to be better secured on the internet, leading to the creation of <a href="https://hin.ch">Health Info Net (HIN)</a>. Starting from encrypted email, Swiss doctors have relied on HIN for decades to keep their patient data&nbsp;safe.</p><p>But technology years are a lot like dog years. And 28 years is a very long&nbsp;time.</p><p>HIN is constantly working to innovate and improve its solutions. Which is how <a href="https://vereign.com">Vereign</a>, working closely with our partner <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/more-than-bits-gmbh">More than Bits</a>, started to run some POCs with HIN in 2023, and ended up working all of 2024 almost exclusively for the Swiss healthcare sector.</p><blockquote>Our challenge: Design a system that starts from what today’s users are used to, while re-thinking the system architecture using SSI and modern data ecosystem architectures, based on the work we had done for&nbsp;Gaia-X.</blockquote><p>The starting point was obvious: Email is the world’s largest distributed identity database and communication protocol. It is the use case with which HIN started, and it is the singular product that all users rely on mutliple times each day to communicate with colleagues, laboratories, and patients.</p><p>Email is also facing challenges of concentration and capture by the large, federated platforms. And its lack of an identity layer has made it a fertile ground for attacks by malicious governments, corporations, and common criminals.</p><p>Vereign showcased its first prototype to harden email using SSI in 2019, which earned us a nomination as the hottest new innovation for the Swiss <a href="https://www.digitaleconomyaward.ch/">Digital Economy Award</a> in Zurich. COVID-19 had other plans, but our experience proved invaluable when working on the POCs with&nbsp;HIN.</p><p>This time, we built out peer to peer email exchange via <a href="https://didcomm.org/">DIDComm</a>. Secure, encrypted, authentic and designed in a way that it can be plugged into any legacy email system to gradually switch to a new, identity verified transport layer reaching all the way to the people themselves.</p> From prototyping to production: Quest for the identifier <p>We built these prototypes using did:web, because it is a great placeholder to stand in for decentralized identifiers while rapidly prototyping around user flow and experience.</p><p>But from the onset it was clear that did:web would not be the choice for production, because for all the reasons also <a href="https://medium.com/@ggreve/self-sovereign-identity-over-before-it-started-661b4b0dbdc6">highlighted in the last&nbsp;article</a>:</p><blockquote>Web based identifiers must never be used for personal identity.</blockquote><p>Our preferred choice would have been <a href="https://keri.one">KERI</a> due to its robust security and privacy architecture. But with the official implementation being Python only, we had concerns about efforts required in supporting a secure, long term solution across the range of platforms we anticipated.</p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/THCLab/keriox">Rust implementation</a> by the Human Colossus Foundation fared better on that front. But there seems to be a rift in the community, causing concerns of diverging implementations, as well as long-term support. Which are exacerbated by the choice for European Public License&nbsp;(EUPL).</p><p>We could not find information about adoption, nor community. And finally, the security of KERI as a concept critically depends on the networks of Witnesses and Watchers, for which we could not find information about size, health and long term viability of these networks for either implementation.</p><p>Had we chosen KERI in February 2024, we would not have been able to go productive before these issues had been resolved. And our time line dictated we had to be ready for initial production by late 2024. As a result, KERI was a non-starter.</p><p>Other methods, such as did:indy, have been in decline for some time, and Sovrin is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sovrin-foundation_to-the-sovrin-community-after-seven-years-activity-7253082729443930112-069C?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">shutting down</a> in just a couple of weeks. Methods like did:peer on the other hand are not great in scenarios where long-lived connections are desirable.</p><blockquote>So in the end, our search for production ready decentralized identifiers that could safely be used for natural persons left us empty&nbsp;handed.</blockquote>A classic. And good&nbsp;advice. Ignoring XKCD <p>The <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">competing standards</a> comic by XKCD is a classic. As far as rules go, it is a good one. But there are no rules without exceptions. Having exhausted every other path, we decided to ignore XKCDs’ best practice. Only, we did not aim to create the universal solution — that’s KERI — but to create the simplest possible, yet still sufficiently safe identifier for the requirements of our specific use&nbsp;case.</p><p>Like any good design, it should build on existing technologies as much as possible, be simple enough to be implemented within a reasonable time frame, and to be supportable for at least 5–10 years, when potentially it would be replaced by something better.</p> Designing a decentralized identifier <p>Our requirements asked for an identifier that was truly secure and private. We explicitly sought to minimize dependencies on infrastructure such as DNS, Web Servers and Certificate Authorities. Blockchain would have fit these criteria, but we do not require a global consensus. All we needed was a decentralized storage system that would guarantee integrity and availability of&nbsp;records.</p><p><a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> might have been an option. It is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage">Content-Addressable Storage</a>, so objects are referenced by their hash, any modification creates a new object. But Git would add unnecessary overhead, and there is a central repository. The <a href="https://ipfs.tech/">Interplanetary File System (IPFS)</a> on the other hand is built for peer to peer distribution between nodes without a central&nbsp;server.</p><p>Like Git, IPFS is built on Content-Addressable Storage (CAS). Objects are referenced by their sha256 hashes. Users can request data at any node, and if that node does not have this particular object, it will use peer-to-peer network connectivity between nodes to obtain a copy of the data and provide it to the user. It is open, verifiable, and resilient.</p><blockquote>Its function allows DID documents to be uploaded onto any node and be referenced by their hash on any node in the network. Modifications to the document modify the hash, so documents are integrity protected by design. Simultaneously, the entire DID storage and distribution mechanism is robust regarding the well-known attacks against Web based identifiers.</blockquote><p>In addition, the hash for the document contains no Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and unless we’d make the mistake of adding PII to the DID documents themselves, our design would not expose any kind of PII anywhere.</p><p>Of course we were not the first, nor the only ones to realize the potential of IPFS for decentralized identifiers. There has been a prior attempt at using IPFS for DID documents, the <a href="https://did-ipid.github.io/ipid-did-method/">IPID DID Method</a>. But it never got much traction, and its use of the <a href="https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/ipns/">InterPlanetary Name System (IPNS)</a> made it less robust. Also, it did not have provisions for the rotation of keys, which is crucial for long-term connections with the same identifier, as well as the ability to switch wallets or upgrade crypto algorithms.</p>Swiss Healthcare: Innovating together toward the gold standard of decentralized, secure, private identity and applications An identifier for Sovereign Data Exchange&nbsp;(SVDX) <p>The result is did:svdx, our DID method for Sovereign Data Exchange.</p><p>Agents generate their active key locally, as well as a key that can be used for the update of the identifier later. The public key of the first key is used as the persistent identifier, creating a persistent Autonomous Identifier (AID).</p><p>The second key, which is used for the update of the identifier, is never shared. Only its hash is declared in the document as a next key commitment. Because this key is never actively used until it is time to rotate, it is well protected against being compromised.</p><p>Each revision of the decentralized identity documents representing a Decentralized Identifier has a Content Identifier (CID) when stored in IPFS, so the resulting identifier is always the combination of the AID with the CID of the latest revision of the identifier.</p><p>Since each revision of the identifier refers back to the previous version by its CID, the result is a sha-256 hash based Key Event Chain of IPFS objects, all the way back to the inception document, the root of the AID in question.</p><p>did:svdx:z6MknHKiY477mH97qryHv3zjuHaTLvBbbp6tHS5SvZv67uR4:QmecqVGBxvW7gjffxmYTGFZNPmJcWmYPdD8azB1cZYaY6F</p><p>Because the identifier also contains the CID of the current state, starting verification of the Key Event Chain is trivial: Just pull the corresponding object out of IPFS and verify. Check for ancestor, rinse and repeat until you’re at the beginning of the chain. Check whether the AID matches the initial key.&nbsp;Done.</p> Trivial to implement in web based tool&nbsp;chains <p>No native IPFS support? No problem. Just pick one of the <a href="https://ipfs.github.io/public-gateway-checker/">public IPFS gateways</a>, and with a single request pull the DID document, e.g. <a href="https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmecqVGBxvW7gjffxmYTGFZNPmJcWmYPdD8azB1cZYaY6F">https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmecqVGBxvW7gjffxmYTGFZNPmJcWmYPdD8azB1cZYaY6F</a>.</p><p>Thanks to content based addressing, you will get the same document no matter which gateway you use. And you’re welcome to use as many of them as you would like to compare. Although for production use cases it is highly recommended to run your own, which is&nbsp;trivial.</p><blockquote>In other words, IPFS allows to integrate classic web based tool chains with decentralized storage and delivery of integrity protected DID documents. It’s as easy as any of the did:web* methods to work with, but does not suffer from the attack surfaces of DNS, TLS and Certificate Authorities.</blockquote><p>In addition, it is robust against a number of DDOS scenarios, allows for low impact self-hosting, and eliminates the web server as a central point of attack, surveillance and compromise.</p><p>Also, it plays well with DIDComm and other communication protocols, but if you really require web based interaction protocols, they can also be encoded into the identifier. But unlike web based identifiers, exchanging key material via did:svdx mitigates a substantial number of attack scenarios for web connection protocols.</p> Layering trust <p>By design did:svdx contains zero personal information. It is deliberately focused on secure key exchange of an Autonomous Identifier, only.</p><p>So any relationship starts from a reliable assumption the AID controllers have a strong connection to one another and can maintain it over a longer period of time, including throughout key rotation and changes in cryptography. But they start from zero trust in one&nbsp;another.</p><p>Trust is built gradually, through Verifiable Presentations securely exchanged over the connection. Similar to what Christopher Allen describes as “<a href="https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/progressive-trust/">Building Trust in Gradients</a>.”</p><p>For SVDX, given it is built for a true P2P, decentralized ecosystem, we surmise that the party initiating a connection first authenticates itself toward the recipient of the connection request before requesting reciprocal information. That should also make data mining or identifier scraping much&nbsp;harder.</p> Limits of&nbsp;did:svdx <p>For any design, it is crucial to know its limits. Firstly, the identifier specification does not contain any of the multi-signature capabilities of systems like KERI. Because we did not require it for our use case at hand, we pushed that complexity, along the complexity of secure restore and key rotation, onto the clients — which we control for the use case at&nbsp;hand.</p><p>Also, while IPFS plays a role similar to that of Witnesses in KERI, there are no Watchers. So there is no built-in detection of duplicity, as Sam Smith calls it. And while parties can update each other on key rotations using DIDComm, allowing each other to verify they are still talking to the same party, the design has no built-in protections against a controller forking their identity.</p><p>For our use case this was not an issue, because there is a central catalogue for the ecosystem to allow looking up the latest, known version of an AID. Which is not ideal for some scenarios. But we considered the solution good enough for what we needed to achieve, given that all controllers need to also maintain their identity and trustworthiness with HIN as the central ecosystem fiduciary.</p><p>That said, it should be possible to design a robust duplicity detection on top of did:svdx, and there may even be scenarios where duplicity is not a primary concern as long as agents always ensure to only consider the latest version of an AID authoritative.</p><blockquote>So did:svdx is not a replacement for KERI. But it is a replacement for web based DID methods, offering far better security, and similar efforts of adoption and support. From our own experience we know it took around 6-8 weeks to implement in JavaScript.</blockquote> What’s next? <p>The first application using did:svdx in production will have ramped up by April&nbsp;2025.</p><p>By mid 2025 we expect hundreds of thousands of production messages sent each month containing verifiable credentials backed by did:svdx. Our roadmap has us building out additional applications until all the institutions and eventually all the patients in Switzerland will have identifiers within the next 2-3&nbsp;years.</p><p>We have already Open Sourced the initial implementation and will continue to add additional implementations. Also, we would love to finalize the specification so that it can be maximally useful to others. And there may be features that would be required for additional use cases, as well as community-based methods for duplicity detection.</p> Open questions   Where is the right place to finalize, publish and maintain did:svdx?  Who would be interested in participating?  What are the critical capabilities that may still be&nbsp;missing?  What kind of best practice operational RFCs should we develop as a community?  <p>If you’re at <a href="https://diceurope.org/">DICE in Zurich</a> this year, I’d love to sit down and discuss these questions with you — alongside everything else you would like to know about our vision for the Sovereign Data Exchange.</p>

<p>This post shows how to implement phone (SMS) verification and two-factor authentication (2FA) using ASP.NET Core Identity. The solution integrates phone-based verification and 2FA mechanisms. The implementation uses ASP.NET Core Identity’s extensibility to incorporate SMS-based verification during user registration and login processes. SMS is no longer a recommended authentication method due to security risks but does provide a good solution for some business cases or user flows like onboarding phone users or phone applications, frontline workers with no desktop or other such solutions with limited security possibilities.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/IdentityOidcPhone2fa">https://github.com/damienbod/IdentityOidcPhone2fa</a></p>



<p></p>



 Setup 



<p>The ASP.NET Core Identity application integrates the SMS provider using the Identity PhoneNumberTokenProvider and an SMS verification service. </p>


  builder.Services.AddDbContext&lt;ApplicationDbContext&gt;(options =&gt;
	options.UseSqlServer(builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection")));

builder.Services.Configure&lt;EmailSettings&gt;(builder.Configuration.GetSection("EmailSettings"));
builder.Services.AddTransient&lt;IEmailSender, EmailSender&gt;();

builder.Services.Configure&lt;SmsOptions&gt;(builder.Configuration.GetSection("SmsOptions"));

var authorization = Convert.ToBase64String(Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(
	$"{builder.Configuration["SmsOptions:Username"]}:{builder.Configuration["SmsOptions:Password"]}"));

builder.Services.AddHttpClient(Consts.SMSeColl, client =&gt;
{
	client.BaseAddress = new Uri($"{builder.Configuration["SmsOptions:Url"]}");
	client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Basic", authorization);
});

builder.Services.AddScoped&lt;SmsProvider&gt;();

builder.Services.AddIdentity&lt;ApplicationUser, IdentityRole&gt;()
	.AddEntityFrameworkStores&lt;ApplicationDbContext&gt;()
	.AddTokenProvider&lt;DataProtectorTokenProvider&lt;ApplicationUser&gt;&gt;(TokenOptions.DefaultProvider)
	.AddTokenProvider&lt;AuthenticatorTokenProvider&lt;ApplicationUser&gt;&gt;(TokenOptions.DefaultAuthenticatorProvider)
	.AddTokenProvider&lt;PhoneNumberTokenProvider&lt;ApplicationUser&gt;&gt;(Consts.Phone)
	.AddTokenProvider&lt;EmailTokenProvider&lt;ApplicationUser&gt;&gt;(Consts.Email);
  


<p></p>



<p>The ApplicationUser needs some new properties to support multiple authentication methods. The properties are used to allow a user to use the selected authentication method or force an authentication on a OpenID Connect client.</p>


  public bool Phone2FAEnabled { get; set; }
public bool Email2FAEnabled { get; set; }
public bool AuthenticatorApp2FAEnabled { get; set; }
public bool Passkeys2FAEnabled { get; set; }
  


<p></p>



<p>An SMS service are used to integrate the SMS, the SmsProvider class. In this demo, the <a href="https://ecall-messaging.com/">eColl</a> messaging service is used to send SMS. The implementation and the configuration would vary if you use a different service.</p>



<p>The SmsProvider is used to verify a phone number, to enable SMS 2FA and to force SMS 2FA. The service uses a HttpClient to access the SMS service rest API. </p>

 Flow 1: Verify phone 



<p>Once a user has authenticated with email and password, the user can verify a phone. To verify the phone, the user MUST be authenticated. If not, a malicious program may send multiple SMS and cause financial harm.   The Add phone number link can be used to start the verification process.</p>







<p></p>



<p>The VerifyPhone Razor page allows the user to enter an mobile phone number to send the SMS. This should be validated for real phone numbers at least. The StartVerificationAsync method is used to send the SMS. The ASP.NET Core Identity method GenerateChangePhoneNumberTokenAsync is used to generate the challenge for the verification.</p>


  var user = await _userManager.GetUserAsync(User);
if (user == null)
{
    return NotFound($"Unable to load user with ID '{_userManager.GetUserId(User)}'.");
}

var result = await _client.StartVerificationAsync(user, Input.PhoneNumber);
  


<p></p>



<p>The UI is not styled, just uses the standard bootstrap styles.</p>







<p></p>



<p>The confirm Razor Page accepts the verification code which was sent to the phone and uses the VerifyAndProcessCode method to validate. The ASP.NET Core Identity VerifyChangePhoneNumberTokenAsync method is used to validate the code.</p>


    public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; OnPostAsync()
  {
      if (!ModelState.IsValid)
      {
          return Page();
      }

      try
      {
          if (Input.PhoneNumber != null &amp;&amp; Input.VerificationCode != null)
          {
              return await VerifyAndProcessCode(Input.PhoneNumber, Input.VerificationCode);
          }
          else
          {
              ModelState.AddModelError("", "Input.PhoneNumber or Input.VerificationCode missing");
          }
      }
      catch (Exception)
      {
          ModelState.AddModelError("", "There was an error confirming the code, please check the verification code is correct and try again");
      }

      return Page();
  }

  private async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; VerifyAndProcessCode(string phoneNumber, string code)
  {
      var applicationUser = await _userManager.GetUserAsync(User);

      if (applicationUser != null)
      {
          var validCodeForUserSession = await _client.CheckVerificationAsync(applicationUser,
              phoneNumber, code);

          return await ProcessValidCode(applicationUser, validCodeForUserSession);
      }
      else
      {
          ModelState.AddModelError("", "No user");
          return Page();
      }
  }

  private async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; ProcessValidCode(ApplicationUser applicationUser, bool validCodeForUserSession)
  {
      if (validCodeForUserSession)
      {
          var phoneNumber = await _userManager.GetPhoneNumberAsync(applicationUser);
          if (Input.PhoneNumber != phoneNumber)
          {
              await _userManager.SetPhoneNumberAsync(applicationUser, Input.PhoneNumber);
          }

          applicationUser.PhoneNumberConfirmed = true;
          var updateResult = await _userManager.UpdateAsync(applicationUser);

          if (updateResult.Succeeded)
          {
              return RedirectToPage("ConfirmPhoneSuccess");
          }
          else
          {
              ModelState.AddModelError("", "There was an error confirming the verification code, please try again");
          }
      }
      else
      {
          ModelState.AddModelError("", "There was an error confirming the verification code");
      }

      return Page();
  }
  


<p></p>



<p>The UI displays the input for the code and the number it was sent to.</p>







<p></p>



 Flow 2: Enable phone 2FA 



<p>Once the phone is verified, it can be used for an SMS 2FA. </p>







<p></p>



<p>The EnableSms2FaAsync method is used to enable the SMS 2FA.</p>


  var user = await _userManager.GetUserAsync(User);
if (user == null)
{
 return NotFound($"Unable to load user with ID '{_userManager.GetUserId(User)}'.");
}

if (user.PhoneNumber != Input.PhoneNumber)
{
 ModelState.AddModelError("Input.PhoneNumber", 
	"Phone number does not match user user, please update or add phone in your profile");
}

await _smsVerifyClient.EnableSms2FaAsync(user, Input.PhoneNumber!);

return RedirectToPage("./VerifyPhone2Fa", new { Input.PhoneNumber });
  


<p></p>



<p>The EnablePhone2Fa Razor page is used to validate the phone number before activating the 2FA.</p>







<p></p>



<p>The VerifyChangePhoneNumberTokenAsync is used to validate and the 2FA is activated.</p>


  var user = await _userManager.GetUserAsync(User);
if (user == null)
{
	return NotFound($"Unable to load user with ID '{_userManager.GetUserId(User)}'.");
}

var verificationCode = Input.Code.Replace(" ", string.Empty).Replace("-", string.Empty);
var is2faTokenValid = await _userManager
	.VerifyChangePhoneNumberTokenAsync(user, verificationCode, user.PhoneNumber!);

if (!is2faTokenValid)
{
	ModelState.AddModelError("Input.Code", "Verification code is invalid.");
	return Page();
}

await _userManager.SetTwoFactorEnabledAsync(user, true);
  


<p></p>



<p>The Verify Phone 2FA Razor page displays the input field for the code.</p>







<p></p>



<p>Once activated, the user should persist some recovery codes.</p>







<p></p>



 Flow 3: SMS 2FA using phone 



<p>Next time the user authenticates, the SMS 2FA is required. The user can use multiple authentication methods, not only SMS. If possible, passkeys or strong authentication should be used.</p>


  if (user.Phone2FAEnabled)
{
 IsPhone = true;
 if (!user.AuthenticatorApp2FAEnabled)
 {
	 await _smsVerifyClient
		.Send2FASmsAsync(user, user.PhoneNumber!);
 }
}
  


<p></p>



 Further flows 



 Phone only authentication 



<p>Requires mass usage protection</p>



 Recover account using Phone authentication 



<p>Requires mass usage protection</p>

   I’ve seen a lot&nbsp;of this sentiment lately, and can relate:   I miss being excited by technology. I wish I could see a way out of the endless hype cycles that continue to elicit little more than cynicism from me. The version of technology that we’re mostly being sold today has almost nothing to do with improving lives, but instead stuffing the pockets of those who already need for nothing.

And it’s entrenched in everything — meaning a momentous challenge to re-wire or meticulously disconnect.</p></blockquote><p>Many of us got excited about technology because of the web, and are discovering, latterly, that it was always the web itself — rather than technology as a whole — that we were excited about. The web is a movement: more than a set of protocols, languages, and software, it was always about bringing about a social and cultural shift that removed traditional gatekeepers to publishing and being heard.</p><p>It’s perhaps hard to remember now, but in the early nineties, finding an audience really meant being discovered and highlighted by a small number of very rich publishing companies (or record labels, etc) who were most often not representative of their audiences. The web was a revolution: anyone could publish their words, their music, or their art, without asking anyone for permission, and they could find their communities equally permissionlessly.</p><p>The web, of course, didn’t turn out to be quite as utopian as the promise. The truth is, the people who could afford to publish on the early web were also from a narrow, relatively wealthy demographic. To make publishing accessible to most people (who didn’t, quite reasonably, want to learn HTML or pay for or configure a domain name and hosting), we needed a set of easy-to-use publishing platforms, which in turn became centralized single points of failure and took the place of the old gatekeepers. Replacing publishers with Facebook wasn’t the original intention, but that’s what happened. And in the process, the power dynamics completely shifted.</p><p>The original web was inherently about redistribution of power from a small number of gatekeepers to a large number of individuals, even if it never quite lived up to that promise. But the next iteration of the web was about concentrating power in a small set of gatekeepers whose near-unlimited growth potential tended towards monopoly. There were always movements that bucked this trend — blogging and the <a href="https://indieweb.org">indie web</a> never really went away — but they were no longer the mainstream force on the internet. And over time, the centralized platforms disempowered their users by <a href="https://werd.io/2018/the-unbearable-monopolization-of-being">monopolizing more and more slices of everyday life that used to be free</a>. The open, unlimited nature of the web that was originally used to distribute equity was now being used to suck it up and concentrate it in a handful of increasingly-wealthy people.</p><p>For the people who were attracted to the near-unlimited wealth hoarding and rent-seeking potential, this new web was incredibly exciting. Conversely, for those of us who were attracted by the power redistribution more than the technology itself, it was incredibly disheartening. The reason we got involved in the first place had all but evaporated.</p><p>For a while, decentralization did become a hot topic. Unfortunately, this was more about avoiding the trappings of traditional banking — crucially, including avoiding regulatory controls — than it was about distributing power. The actual equity redistribution was mostly an illusion; although there certainly were people with their hearts in the right place in the movement, the people who truly gained from blockchain and cryptocurrencies <a href="https://www.web3isgoinggreat.com/">were libertarian grifters</a> who saw potential in moving money away from the prying eyes of regulatory oversight and saw banking regulations designed to protect people as being unnecessarily restrictive. Blockchain wore the clothes of power redistribution, but rather than empowering a large number of people, it enriched very few, often at other people’s expense.</p><p>I do think the brief popularity of blockchain helped bring attention to decentralization, which was useful. I don’t know that as much attention would have been paid to the new crop of decentralized social networks like Mastodon and BlueSky, for example, had Web3 not previously seeded some of the core ideas in a more mainstream consciousness. The web3 community was also the most successful at, for example, embedding identity in the browser. It wasn’t valueless as a movement, but it fell far short of the hype.</p><p>Which brings us to AI, the current hotness. Like any software technology, it’s being sold to us as an empowering tool. But the broad perception is that it’s anything but: models are trained, unpaid, on the work of artists, writers, and researchers, who are already relatively low-paid, in order to build value for a small handful of vendors who are making deals worth tens or hundreds of billions of dollars. Or <a href="https://mastodon.world/@jeffowski/112782711430862267">as one commenter put it</a>:</p><blockquote><p>The underlying purpose of AI is to allow wealth to access skill while removing from skill the ability to access wealth.</p></blockquote><p>If you think this is hyperbole, consider Marc Benioff’s comments about <a href="https://www.salesforceben.com/salesforce-will-hire-no-more-software-engineers-in-2025-says-marc-benioff/">not hiring any more software engineers in 2025</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“We’re not adding any more software engineers next year because we have increased the productivity this year with Agentforce and with other AI technology that we’re using for engineering teams by more than 30% – to the point where our engineering velocity is incredible. I can’t believe what we’re achieving in engineering.”</p></blockquote><p>Whether you care about software engineering jobs or not, the same dynamics are underway for writers, artists, and any other creative job. Even the productivity gains that are being realized through use of AI tools are benefiting a small number of wealthy companies rather than individuals. This is the exact opposite of the power redistribution that led to so many people seeing such promise in the web.</p><p>It’s very hard to get excited about technology that redistributes wealth and power in favor of people who already have it.</p><p>The trajectory of the web — starting as a tool for redistributing power and becoming one that entrenches it — was not inevitable. It was the result of specific choices: business models that prioritized monopolization, technologies designed for centralization, and a relentless focus on extracting value rather than creating it. If we want a different future, we have to make different choices.</p><p>What does an alternative look like? It starts with software designed for people rather than for capital. The web once thrived on protocols instead of platforms — email, RSS, blogs, personal websites — before closed networks turned users into data sources. We are now seeing efforts to return to that ethos. The Fediverse, open-source publishing tools, community-run platforms, and decentralized identity projects all point to a path where individuals have more control over their online lives. They aren’t perfect, but they represent a fundamental shift in intention: building systems that work for people instead of on them.</p><p>The first wave of the web was decentralized by default but only accessible to a small number of people. The second wave was more accessible but centralized by profit motives. If there is to be a third wave, it will have to be intentional: built with equity and accessibility as core values, not an afterthought. That’s a hard road, because open and ethical technology doesn’t attract billion-dollar investments the way extractive models do. But if history has shown anything, it’s that the web’s greatest strength is in the people who believe it can be better. The real question is not whether more equitable software is possible: it’s whether enough of us are willing to build it.</p><p>For many of us, the social movement, rather than the underlying technology, was always the point. We need that movement more than ever before. Hopefully building it is something that more of us can get excited about.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Photo: <a href="https://meta.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:This_is_for_Everyone.jpg">Tim Berners-Lee's tweet "This is for everyone" at the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony</a>, released under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/deed.en">Creative Commons Attribution 2.0 Generic license</a>.<br></p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vladimirdzhuvinov/">Vladimir Dzhuvinov</a> and I led a discussion on The Cambrian Explosion of OAuth and OpenID Specifications at the <a href="https://oauth.secworkshop.events/osw2025">2025 OAuth Security Workshop</a> in Reykjavík.</p>
<p>The abstract for the session was:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The number of OAuth and OpenID specifications continues to grow.  At present there are 30 OAuth RFCs, two more in the RFC Editor queue, 13 OAuth working group drafts, and another eight individual OAuth drafts that may advance.  There are nine JOSE RFCs and seven working group drafts.  There are four SecEvent RFCs.  On the OpenID side, there are 12 final OpenID Connect specs, three final FAPI specs, one final MODRNA spec, three final eKYC-IDA specs, and 24 Implementer’s drafts across the OpenID working groups, plus another ten working group drafts.</p>
<p>The number of possible combinations boggles the mind.  And there’s no end in sight!</p>
<p>What’s a developer to do?  How have people and companies gone about selecting and curating the specs to implement in an attempt to create coherent and useful open source and commercial offerings?  And faced with such an array of combinations and choices, how are application developers to make sense of it all?  How can interoperability be achieved in the face of continued innovation?</p>
<p>This session will prime the pump by discussing choices made by some existing open source and commercial offerings in the OAuth and OpenID space and lead to an open discussion of choices made by the workshop attendees and the reasoning behind them.  It’s our goal that useful strategies emerge from the discussion that help people grapple with the ever-expanding sets of specifications and make informed implementation choices, while still fostering the innovation and problem-solving that these specifications represent.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The slides used to queue up the discussion session are available as <a href="https://self-issued.info/presentations/OSW_2025_The_Cambrian_Explosion_of_OAuth_and_OpenID_Specifications.pptx">PowerPoint</a> and <a href="https://self-issued.info/presentations/OSW_2025_The_Cambrian_Explosion_of_OAuth_and_OpenID_Specifications.pdf">PDF</a>.  Also, see the <a href="https://self-issued.info/presentations/OAuth_and_OpenID_Specifications_February_2025.docx">list of 101 OAuth and OpenID-related specifications</a> referenced during the discussion.</p>
<p>The topic seems to have touched a chord.  Many people were clearly already thinking about the situation and shared their views.  Some of them were:</p>
 
 Nobody actually expects everyone to implement everything. 
 Stopping things is super hard.  But sometimes it’s necessary (as Brian Campbell put it, “when they’re wrong”). 
 Timing can be fickle.  What may not be useful at one time can turn out to be useful later. 
 Some specs are highly related and often used together. But those relationships are not always apparent to those new to the space. 
 We need better on-ramps to help people new to the space wrap their arms around the plethora specs and what they’re useful for. 
 Well-written profiles are a way of managing the complexity.  For instance, <a href="https://openid.net/specs/fapi-security-profile-2_0.html">FAPI 2</a> limits choices, increasing both interoperability and security. 
 The amount of innovation happening is a sign of success! 
 
<p>Thanks to the organizers for a great tenth OAuth Security Workshop!  And special thanks to the colleagues from <a href="https://www.signicat.com/">Signicat</a> who did a superb job with local arrangements in Reykjavík!</p>

<p>3月4日(火) 10:00-12:40に「FAPIとVCの世界動向　～FAPI2.0 &amp; Verifiable Credentials~」と題されたセミナーがFINOLABイベントスペースで開催されます。私もちょっとだけでます。</p>



<p>金融機関におけるKYC等にそれらデジタル資格証明を利用するとした場合の様々な考慮事項の検討や、世界のオープンバンキングとFAPI 2.0についての解説を聞くことができます。前者の話題としては、富士榮さんたちの論文「<a href="https://dal.sfc.keio.ac.jp/ja/TR/management-requirements-for-digital-credentials/">デジタルクレデンシャルの利用用途に応じた管理要件に関する考察</a>」の解説も聞けるかも？！</p>



<p>ぜひお越しください。</p>



 セミナー概要 



<p>Japan FinTech Week期間中に開催される今回のセミナーでは、「FAPI」と「Verifiable Credentials」をとりあげ、世界の最新動向を紹介するとともに、今後の業務での実装について議論させていただく予定ですので、是非ご参加ください。<br><br>◆日時　　：2025年3月4日(火) 10:00-12:40（開場　9:40）<br>◆会場　　：<a href="https://finolab.tokyo/jp">FINOLAB</a>イベントスペース<br>　　　　　　東京都千代田区大手町1-6-1 大手町ビル4F<br>　　　　　　　※大手町ビルは東西に長いビルで入口は東端、東京駅側にあります。<br>◆使用言語：日本語（英語資料も提供）<br>◆参加費用：無料　<br>◆主催　　：株式会社Authlete／伊藤忠テクノソリューションズ株式会社<br>◆後援　　：株式会社FINOLAB<br></p>



 アジェンダ：<br> 



 10:00₋10:05　開会のご挨拶<br> 



 10:05-11:00　デジタル資格証明のガバナンス　鈴木 茂哉氏（慶応義塾大学）　富士榮 尚寛氏（伊藤忠テクノソリューションズ）　　 



<p>Verifiable Credentialsなど持ち運び可能なデジタル資格証明と関連技術に注目が集まっていますが、例えば金融機関におけるKYC等にそれらデジタル資格証明を利用するとした場合、様々な考慮事項があります。慶應義塾大学SFC研究所と伊藤忠テクノソリューションズ株式会社はEUや欧米の最新動向を踏まえ、デジタル資格証明の管理要件やガバナンスについて共同研究を行ってきました。本セッションでは両者が共同で発行したディスカッションペーパー「デジタルクレデンシャルの利用用途に応じた管理要件」についてご紹介しつつ、今後デジタルクレデンシャルを金融サービス等に適用していく上で必要な論点について考察していきます。</p>



<p></p>



 11:00-11:55 オープンバンキングとFAPI 2.0　　川崎 貴彦氏（Authlete） 



<p>2010年代中頃、金融業界の競争活性化を主目的としたオープンバンキング政策が英国で開始されました。この政策によりコンピュータプログラムから金融サービスへアクセスする仕組みが構築された結果、多様な金融サービスが生まれ、人々の生活はより便利になりました。今となっては世界中に広がったこのオープンバンキングムーブメントですが、それを技術的に支えているのがFAPIと呼ばれる世界標準技術仕様です。そのFAPIも、今年2月にFAPI 2.0最終版が承認され、大きな節目を迎えました。このセッションでは、FAPI 2.0仕様の著者達が所属するAuthlete社が、オープンバンキングとFAPI 2.0について解説します。</p>

<p>The Pulse is <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/s/the-pulse">a series</a> covering insights, patterns, and trends within Big Tech and startups. Notice an interesting event or trend? <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/contact/">Send me a message</a>.</p><p>Today, we cover:</p>  <p>Industry pulse. Amazon launches Alexa+, VS Code pulls “epic” but malicious theme, Meta cuts stock awards by 10%, Humane sells to HP, and more.</p>  <p>Swarm of AI coding tool launches. Anthropic launches Sonnet 3.7 (a supposedly even more capable LLM for coding) and Claude Code. GitHub ships Copilot Code Reviews, and Google makes Gemini Code Assist free for individual users (from $22.80 per month). Us devs are showered with new tools that all aim to improve workflows.</p>  <p>DeepSeek triggers higher GPU demand? It’s been predicted that more efficient LLMs will decrease demand for GPUs, but DeepSeek is 4-5x as efficient as some current LLMs, and appears to be driving up demand. Also, a look at the very clever “hacks” DeepSeek uses to boost performance on NVIDIA GPUs.</p>  <p>VC funding down, AI funding up. VC firms are increasingly shutting down, with overall funding levels dropping. AI-related funding is up – along with competition among startups to get funded. We <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/zirp">predicted</a> VC funding could dry up <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/zirp">due to interest rate changes</a>, and the data seems to show this happening.</p>  <p>What does “zero” mean for dates in COBOL? A reminder that “0” and “null” might not mean what you expect in some programming languages and systems.</p>   1. Industry Pulse  Amazon launches Alexa+ <p>A year ago, I analyzed how Alexa <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/146756242/how-did-alexa-get-left-behind-in-conversational-ai">had become left behind</a> in the conversational AI race by missing the LLM wave, despite Amazon Alexa being a great use case for an integrated LLM, in order to provide better conversational experiences and new capabilities.</p><p>Well, 12 months later, Amazon seems to have caught up. This week, the online retail giant <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/new-alexa-generative-artificial-intelligence">announced</a> Alexa+, which is a revamped, more capable conversational assistant. It promises to make reservations or book rides by using apps like OpenTable and Uber, buy things on Amazon (obviously), manage smart speakers in the home, discover new music, and more.</p><p>The <a href="https://x.com/ParkerOrtolani/status/1894771550718484863">launch demo</a> looks very polished and capable. But then, Apple’s glossy launch demos for Apple Intelligence didn’t stop the feature still <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/156613118/apple-intelligence-half-baked">feeling half-baked</a> months later.</p><p>Under the hood, Alexa is partially <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-and-alexa-plus">powered by Claude</a>, which Amazon didn’t announce, and Anthropic did. This suggests Anthropic’s models are ahead of Amazon’s own <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/155552919/amazons-ai-models-fail-to-impress">Nova models</a>. Still, Amazon is clearly creating optionality for itself by not advertising Alexa’s dependence on Claude; when and if the Nova models are good enough, Amazon could replace Anthrophic’s solution with its own.</p><p>The Amazon+ pricing is puzzling: Alexa+ is free for Amazon Prime members ($14.99 monthly), and $19.99 per month for everyone else. This seems to make little sense; why charge so much more for a standalone subscription than for a bundle? Is it because Amazon wants to dis-incentivize customers just subscribing to Alexa+?</p><p>Either way, Amazon is making a stronger-than-ever case for customers to choose Amazon Prime for $14.99: which is probably the goal of upgrading Alexa.</p> VS Code pulls “epic” malicious theme

For today’s episode, I sat down with him, to go through more comics, why he created them, and the deeper meaning behind several of these.</p><p>Manu spent over a decade at Google, doing both backend and frontend development. He also spent a year and a half at Twitter before Elon Musk purchased it and rebranded it to X. But what Manu is most known for are his hilarious internet comics about the tech world, including his famous org chart comic from 2011 about Facebook, Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft.</p><p>In today’s conversation, we explore many of his comics, discuss the meaning behind them, and talk about the following topics:</p>  <p>The viral org chart comic that captured the structure of Big Tech companies</p>  <p>Why Google is notorious for confusing product names</p>  <p>The comic that ended up on every door at Google</p>  <p>How Google’s 20% time fostered innovation—and what projects came from it</p>  <p>How one of Manu’s comics predicted Google Stadia’s failure—and the reasons behind it</p>  <p>The value of connecting to users directly</p>  <p>Twitter’s climate before and after Elon Musk’s acquisition and the mass layoffs that followed</p>  <p>And more!</p>      <p>This is an unusually visual episode, offering the story behind several comics about Big Tech, Google and Twitter that you might have seen. With Manu, we discuss the deeper meaning behind several of these — ones that are pretty obvious to those who worked inside these companies, but might be less intuitive if you’re only seeing them for the first time.</p> The Pragmatic Engineer deepdives relevant for this episode <p>• <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/manu">How Manu creates comics</a></p><p>• <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/consolidating-technologies">Consolidating technologies</a></p><p>• <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/is-big-tech-becoming-more-cutthroat">Is Big Tech becoming more cutthroat?</a></p> Timestamps <p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoJ0qOavhs&amp;t=0s">00:00</a>) Intro</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoJ0qOavhs&amp;t=121s">02:01</a>) Manu’s org structure comic</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoJ0qOavhs&amp;t=430s">07:10</a>) Manu’s “Who Sues Who” comic</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoJ0qOavhs&amp;t=555s">09:15</a>) Google vs. Amazon comic</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoJ0qOavhs&amp;t=850s">14:10</a>) Confusing names at Google</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoJ0qOavhs&amp;t=1200s">20:00</a>) Different approaches to sharing information within companies</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoJ0qOavhs&amp;t=1340s">22:20</a>) The two ways of doing things at Google</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoJ0qOavhs&amp;t=1515s">25:15</a>) Manu’s code reviews comic</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoJ0qOavhs&amp;t=1665s">27:45</a>) The comic that was printed on every single door of Google</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoJ0qOavhs&amp;t=1855s">30:55</a>) An explanation of 20% at Google</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoJ0qOavhs&amp;t=2160s">36:00</a>) Gmail Labs and Google Stadia</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoJ0qOavhs&amp;t=2496s">41:36</a>) Manu’s time at Twitter and the threat of Elon Musk buying</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoJ0qOavhs&amp;t=2827s">47:07</a>) How Manu helped Gergely with a bug on Twitter</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoJ0qOavhs&amp;t=2945s">49:05</a>) Musk’s acquirement of Twitter and the resulting layoffs</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoJ0qOavhs&amp;t=3540s">59:00</a>) Manu’s comic about his disillusionment with Twitter and Google</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoJ0qOavhs&amp;t=3757s">1:02:37</a>) Rapid fire round</p> A summary of the conversation  The org chart comic   <p>Manu created <a href="https://goomics.net/62">this comic</a> in 2011 featuring the org charts of big tech companies like Amazon, Google, Facebook, Apple, Oracle, and Microsoft.</p>  <p>Manu almost didn't publish the comic because he didn't find it funny by the time he finished drawing it. The punchline was Oracle having a large legal department and a tiny engineering department.</p>  <p>The comic became very popular and has been referenced heavily.</p>     The culture inside Google   <p>Google has a problem naming things, which Manu attributes to its bottom-up culture and engineers starting competing projects.</p>  <p>There isn't much top-down pressure to consolidate efforts, leading to consumer confusion.</p>  <p>An example of Google's naming issues is the evolution from Google Wallet to Android Pay to Google Pay, with logo changes causing confusion for partners like Uber.</p>    <p>Manu created <a href="https://goomics.net/207">a comic about this</a>: how confusing it is to interact with Google products due to the different names.</p>  <p>The “<a href="https://goomics.net/291">Google Graveyard comic</a>” was prophetic: it predicted that Google's cloud gaming console Stadia would eventually be killed.</p>   Google vs Amazon   <p>Manu created a comic <a href="https://goomics.net/329">contrasting Google and Amazon</a> in their engineering culture, and how they treat customers</p>  <p>Amazon is known for bending over backwards for customers, including AWS clients.</p>  <p>Google focuses on building useful features but lacks strong customer service.</p>  <p>Amazon's on-call practices are tough, while Google's are more relaxed, with SREs taking on much of the on-call load.</p>     Google’s engineering culture   <p><a href="https://goomics.net/50">The comic about migrations</a> at Google: shows the challenges of adopting new systems before they are ready. One Google exec said, "There's two ways to do things at Google. There's the deprecated way and there's the way that doesn't work yet".</p>  <p>One on code reviews: shows the software engineer trying to replace a light bulb while being critiqued on how to screw it in.</p>  <p>Another comic depicts the author of the change who says, "Oh, I don't need to be too cautious about my code. If there's some problem, the reviewer will catch it," and the reviewer who says, "Oh, I don't need to review this too carefully if the author must've know what he's doing or what she's doing".</p>  <p>Google used Manu's "Beware the Tailgator" comic on office doors to prevent theft by reminding employees not to let unverified people into the building. He created updated versions each year.</p>  <p>Google's 20% time allowed employees to dedicate a portion of their time to projects of their choosing.</p>  <p>Gmail and Google News were started as 20% projects.</p>  <p>The company has become more traditional and less encouraging of 20% projects.</p>  <p>There may be a connection between Google's 20% time and the high number of products it shuts down.</p>  <p>Google could experiment internally without necessarily launching everything publicly.</p>  <p>Gmail Labs allowed people to launch things with lower scrutiny and made it clear that these were not officially supported and they may go out at any point.</p>  <p>Manu <a href="https://goomics.net/343">created a comic about ending of this practice</a> as well</p>     Move to Twitter and Musk’s takeover   <p>Manu left Google and joined Twitter because it felt like a younger version of Google, with a friendly culture and less red tape.</p>  <p>Shortly after Manu joined Twitter, Elon Musk began his attempt to acquire the company, creating uncertainty.</p>  <p>After Musk bought Twitter, there were massive firings, with at least 50% and ultimately around 80% of employees being let go.</p>  <p>Manu created a bunch of <a href="https://twittoons.com/">comics about the events at Twitter</a> – and later also published <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Twittoons-employees-chronicle-Twitters-accelerated/dp/1952629020">a comic book</a> about it</p>  <p>While Manu was also let go from Twitter: the cartoonist side of himself was having a great time witnessing the events at Twitter.</p>  <p>As a fun fact, Manu doesn't have a favorite programming language. He chooses the best tool for the job, and has been coding with Java, JavaScript, Python, C++, Objective-C, Swift, Rust, and C. He also <a href="https://ma.nu/faves/">built a site</a> with all his book, movie and music recommendations.</p><p>Where to find Manu Cornet:</p><p>• Mastodon: <a href="https://twit.social/@manu">https://twit.social/@manu</a></p><p>• LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/manucornet/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/manucornet/</a></p><p>• Website: <a href="https://ma.nu/">https://ma.nu/</a></p><p>Mentions during the episode:</p><p>• Code Review on Printed Paper: an Excerpt from the Twitoons Comic Book: <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/code-review-on-printed-paper-an-excerpt">https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/code-review-on-printed-paper-an-excerpt</a></p><p>• A much clearer insight into who sues who: <a href="https://bonkersworld.net/who-sues-who">https://bonkersworld.net/who-sues-who</a></p><p>• CEO's "Burning Platform" Memo Highlights Nokia's Woes: <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericsavitz/2011/02/09/ceos-burning-platform-memo-highlights-nokias-woes/">https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericsavitz/2011/02/09/ceos-burning-platform-memo-highlights-nokias-woes/</a></p><p>• Guns and Roses: <a href="https://bonkersworld.net/guns-and-roses">https://bonkersworld.net/guns-and-roses</a></p><p>• The Full Circle on Developer Productivity with Steve Yegge: <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/steve-yegge">https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/steve-yegge</a></p><p>• Grab: <a href="https://www.grab.careers/en/">https://www.grab.careers/en/</a></p><p>• Comic about the confusing Google names: <a href="https://goomics.net/207">https://goomics.net/207</a></p><p>• Naming dashboard: <a href="https://goomics.net/239">https://goomics.net/239</a></p><p>• Access: <a href="https://goomics.net/370">https://goomics.net/370</a></p><p>• Welcome to Google: <a href="https://goomics.net/50">https://goomics.net/50</a></p><p>• Eric Schmidt on X: <a href="https://x.com/ericschmidt">https://x.com/ericschmidt</a></p><p>• Jonathan Rosenberg on X: <a href="https://x.com/jjrosenberg">https://x.com/jjrosenberg</a></p><p>• Code Reviews: <a href="https://bonkersworld.net/code-reviews">https://bonkersworld.net/code-reviews</a></p><p>• Beware the Tailgator: <a href="https://goomics.net/56">https://goomics.net/56</a></p><p>• 20% time: <a href="https://goomics.net/343">https://goomics.net/343</a></p><p>• Where did Gmail labs go?: <a href="https://zapier.com/blog/gmail-labs-missing/">https://zapier.com/blog/gmail-labs-missing/</a></p><p>• Google Stadia: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Stadia">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Stadia</a></p><p>• Google engineer who criticized the company in viral comics on why he finally quit: <a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-engineer-manu-cornet-comics-critique">https://mashable.com/article/google-engineer-manu-cornet-comics-critique</a></p><p>• Network effect: <a href="https://goomics.net/324">https://goomics.net/324</a></p><p>• The Twitter Worker Who Captured Elon Musk’s Takeover in All Its Cartoonish Glory: <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2022/11/elon-musk-twitter-cartoons-manu-cortnet.html">https://slate.com/technology/2022/11/elon-musk-twitter-cartoons-manu-cortnet.html</a></p><p>• Howl’s Moving Castle: <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0347149/">https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0347149/</a></p><p>• Tesla: <a href="https://www.tesla.com/">https://www.tesla.com/</a></p><p>• Twittoons: One employee's cartoon chronicle of Twitter's accelerated descent: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Twittoons-employees-chronicle-Twitters-accelerated/dp/1952629020">https://www.amazon.com/Twittoons-employees-chronicle-Twitters-accelerated/dp/1952629020</a></p><p>• Javascript: https://www.javascript.com/</p><p>• C++: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B</a></p><p>• Python: <a href="https://www.python.org/">https://www.python.org/</a></p><p>• Swift: <a href="https://www.swift.org/">https://www.swift.org/</a></p><p>• Rust: <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">https://www.rust-lang.org/</a></p><p>• CSS: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS</a></p><p>• Manu’s favorites: <a href="https://ma.nu/faves/">https://ma.nu/faves/</a></p><p>• Mind the Goof (Gomer Goof #1): <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Goof-Gomer-Franquin/dp/1849183589">https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Goof-Gomer-Franquin/dp/1849183589</a></p><p>• Building Software: <a href="https://bonkersworld.net/building-software">https://bonkersworld.net/building-software</a></p><p>—</p><p>Production and marketing by <a href="https://penname.co/">Pen Name</a>.

<p>Today, there’s an ever-growing number of startups, scaleups, and established companies like Boston Dynamics producing increasingly capable robots, including ones that look humanoid. Tech giants like Tesla have been building humanoid robots, and Meta is expected to invest billions in the technology. These and other factors point to the possibility that, after artificial intelligence, robotics could be the “next big thing” in tech.</p><p>But what’s the process of building intelligent robots, and what’s it like as a day-to-day job for the developers who do? It’s not always easy to find this out because robotics startups are famously shrouded in secrecy – and with such cutting-edge technology, it’s unsurprising.</p><p>Academia is often a bit more open, so I turned to MIT Robot Learning Researcher, <a href="https://sandorfelber.github.io/">Sandor Felber</a>. He’s a Humanoid Robot Learning Researcher at MIT in Boston, Massachusetts, and previously led a team that built a self-driving race car. Sandor’s also been a robotics intern at Tesla in Palo Alto, California, and a robotics R&amp;D engineer at the Edinburgh Center of Robotics.</p><p>Today, he takes us through:</p>  <p>Getting into robotics.

Getting into robotics, a personal account <p>My interest in robotics began in high school, where I wrote the junior equivalent of a dissertation on characterization methods for how electric motors behave under different conditions. This led me to pursue a degree in electrical and mechanical engineering at the University of Edinburgh, home to numerous renowned robotics and AI researchers.</p><p>Building a driverless electric race car was one of my bigger projects. At uni, I joined the Edinburgh University Formula Student (EUFS) team, where we designed, built, and raced a driverless electric race car. From a roboticist’s perspective, this is considered a wheeled mobile robot.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13984217-0029-431e-8314-60934e584fe1_1600x900.jpeg">          </a>My team’s driverless (but also human-drivable) electric vehicle, SISU23D, at launch.

Source: Nikita Jegorovs <p>Along the way, I discovered a passion for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory">control theory</a>. Control systems engineers tend to concern themselves with crafting control strategies that ensure optimal performance, from spacecraft trajectories to insulin delivery in diabetics.</p><p>In robotics, you could think of control theory as the invisible puppeteer of a robotic arm, except that instead of pulling strings, it's using mathematics to orchestrate every joint's motion in real time. As a robotic arm needs to smoothly pick up an egg without crushing it, control theory provides the mathematical "muscle memory" that turns crude motor commands into precise, graceful movements. It does this with constant sensor feedback and adjustments, with the approach adjusted depending on how sensitive the control system is to the various feedback signals.</p><p>My interest in control theory and background in batteries, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powertrain">powertrains</a> (vehicle motors), and electrical control systems from previous internships landed me one at Tesla's robotics department. Since then, I’ve worked with academic and industrial stakeholders on projects ranging from quadruped (quad- as in four, and -ped as in legged) dog-like robots, to humanoid systems.</p><p>I’m currently at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL), focusing on teaching humanoid robots to perform complex, real-world tasks using learned controllers, powered by neural networks. I’m particularly interested in embedding intelligence into robots by leveraging various types of learning, including supervised and unsupervised learning, offline and online deep reinforcement learning, and imitation learning.</p><p>I use these approaches for humanoid robot locomotion, manipulation, whole-body control, and teleoperation (remotely controlling the robot).</p> 2. Robotics industry overview <p>Robotics companies are raising more money than ever before. In the first eight months of 2024, global robotics companies <a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/from-surge-to-sobriety-the-state-of-robotics-investment-in-2024/">attracted</a> a record amount of $10.8 billion in funding, averaging $1.2 billion per month! What’s all the hype fuelling this surge of capital?</p><p>In public debate, there’s no shortage of focus on labor shortages and stagnating productivity, which reduce growth and competitiveness. The US economy is <a href="https://www.conference-board.org/topics/global-labor-market-outlook/press/global-labor-market-outlook-2024">estimated</a> to be missing up to 4.6 million workers annually needed to maintain levels of supply and demand, according to <a href="https://www.conference-board.org/topics/global-labor-market-outlook/press/global-labor-market-outlook-2024">a recent study</a>. That number equates to 2% of the current US population. The same study suggests Germany needs to find an additional 1.6 million workers to keep current economic levels; 3% of its population.</p><p>This is one driver of industrial robots’ increased adoption, which shows no sign of slowing down. Sustaining economic growth amid shrinking labor pools is one viable path for robotics which is getting a lot of attention, as evidenced in the increased adoption of industrial robots, with global installations reaching nearly 600,000 units in 2024, as per <a href="https://www.robotics247.com/article/world_robotics_report_2023_shows_ongoing_global_growth_installations_finds_ifr">the World Robotics Report</a>. This figure surpassed previous benchmarks and shows that industries struggling with labor shortages can return to growth.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a02585a-17a1-4a22-8185-f673cda48fe9_800x450.png">          </a>Industry robots are reshaping the automotive industry as key parts of assembly lines traditionally operated by humans. Source: <a href="https://www.wevolver.com/article/automotive-robots">Wevolver</a> <p>If robots become ubiquitous, what will humans do? This is the most common concern I hear when I talk about my work. The question is an old one: on the New York subway, I stumbled upon a <a href="https://www.nytransitmuseum.org/holidaynostalgiarides/">Holiday Nostalgia Ride</a>, which offers a trip in an old subway car from between the 1930s and 1970s. My coach looked like it was from the 1960s, and inside was an advert about upskilling for “tomorrow’s jobs:”</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8bf4a0e4-4966-478d-91d9-cfe88313b373_1334x1334.jpeg">          </a>A poster on the New York subway in the 1960s <p>The world has changed massively since then, thanks in part to automation, without which our standards of comfort wouldn’t be possible or affordable; think of the dishwasher that automates the washing up and helps canteens to offer a cheaper menu, than if they had to hire extra people to wash dishes and pay for excess water (new dishwashers are very efficient).</p><p>Acquiring new skills in a quickly-changing world is as least as necessary today as it was back then; as illustrated by that subway ad from the mid-20th century.</p> Industry vs academia <p>Approaches to research and development have always differed between industry and academia. Having worked in both environments, here’s how I see them compare in robotics:</p><p>Academia: smaller “long-shot” bets, developed on a budget. Many projects take years to mature, due to the limited effort that a couple of post-docs, PhD students, and undergrads can dedicate.</p><p>Industry: execute on proven concepts with substantial backing. Industry prioritizes execution on feasible concepts. Once a concept is assumed to work – as usually verified by a proof-of-concept (POC), also known as a “minimum viable product” in startup lingo – industry players can raise vast amounts of money to build it.</p><p>Modern robotics may have reached an inflection point, where enough academic “long-shot” bets are delivering results, with feasible paths to building practical robots, including humanoid ones. Examples of bets made on robotic hardware:</p>  <p>Tesla’s Optimus humanoid prototype</p>  <p>Boston Dynamics bidding <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9EM5_VFlt8">farewell to hydraulics </a>and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29ECwExc-_M">welcoming electric actuators</a> on its all-new humanoid platform, Atlas</p>  <p>1X building a humanoid robot, <a href="https://evjang.com/2024/08/31/motors.html">NEO</a></p>   <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F063c47db-e26d-4dc0-a597-637cd6737783_1600x966.png">          </a>Three humanoid robots: These are calculated bets with significant investment  3. Planning a robotics project <p>Here’s how I’ve seen robotics projects get done.</p><p>Vision for a demo: many robotics projects start with the question: “What should the robot achieve when completed?” Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak’s “coffee test” is one such vision, now frequently referred to as the “New Turing Test.” <a href="https://koopingshung.com/blog/turing-test-is-obsolete-bring-in-coffee-test/">His definition</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“A machine is required to enter an average American home and figure out how to make coffee: find the coffee machine, find the coffee, add water, find a mug, and brew the coffee by pushing the proper buttons."</p></blockquote><p>In practice, on most projects I’ve seen, the vision gets watered down or descoped as deadlines approach, and material or human resources become limiting factors. However a demo that passes the test above could well serve as a benchmark for artificial general intelligence (AGI). As part of that test, a physically-embodied machine must demonstrate intelligence by entering a random home and successfully making a cup of coffee with tools available in a previously unseen kitchen.</p><p>After the vision is set, the next steps are:</p><p>Planning: goals, demoable outcomes, and target applications or target environments. The requirements of a good demo in a target environment can be very high!</p><p>Break things down. Translating deliverables into functional requirements. For each functional requirement, one or more features that show successful fulfillment need to be identified. When breaking things down, features are often separated into at least two subsets:</p>  <p>Critical: those that must be present in the final product. If missing, the project is considered a failure. An example is a humanoid robot weighing 50kg that is deployed in warehouse automation, that needs to carry 10kg payload per arm. If the electric motors moving the arms are too weak, or the ankles suddenly overheat, when operating at 68kg in total, then a client won’t be happy with the product or service (RaaS, or Robot-as-a-Service is a thing now). Therefore, this feature likely requires robust engineering all the way to the very left side of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-model">V-model</a>. Identifying such interdependencies and making engineering design calls that aid the design, based on engineering intuition, is challenging and part of what makes for great technical leaders.</p>  <p>Nice-to-have: features that a final project could ship without, such as a higher control frequency in order to achieve smoother, less jittery motion. Note, these cannot be fully neglected but can be considered soft constraints, in contrast to critical features which tend to be hard constraints. A robot that gets the job done, even if not as smoothly, could still be counted as a success with room for improvement.</p>  <p>Critical vs nice-to-have thresholds can change over time. Hard constraints (“critical”) vs soft ones (“nice-to-have”) are often linked, and the difference lies in arbitrary measures of quantity and quality.</p><p>Being clear about the “minimum needed” (critical) and “nice-to-have” requirement thresholds is good practice in robotics projects. These can change as the project develops, turning nice-to-haves into critical ones. As long as everyone on the project is notified and on-board when changes happen, then a project should progress without hiccups.</p> 4. Development phase <p>During development, robotics engineers need to balance proof-of-concept experiments with the scaling of a project, including the supporting infrastructure. For example, one proof-of-concept experiment could be verifying that a parallel jaw gripper (the robot’s hand) can grasp a mug in specific setups.</p><p>Scaling can be hard because there are lots of problems in the real world to solve. Scaling the above example of holding a mug can be seen as:</p>

<p>In October 2023, my wife emerged from the bathroom one morning to report that we had no hot water. I found that our gas-fired, on-demand water heater had failed and was leaking a small amount. I called our plumber, who confirmed we needed a new water heater.</p>



<p>We immediately faced the following decision: Should we replace our water heater with a similar gas-fired on-demand unit or change to an electric heat pump water heater? We have been hearing a great deal about the efficiency and ecological benefits of heat pump water heaters, and on-demand gas units like the one we had are said to emit considerably more carbon than even gas-fired tank units.</p>



<p>Placement for a heat pump water heater would be a challenge. The water heater had been located in the attic, and the heat pump water heater was somewhat taller than even the gas-fired tank unit that was installed at the time we bought the house. That meant it could not fit in the attic and would need to be installed in the garage. We found a reasonable location, although we would lose storage space in the garage. It also meant that the loop for our hot water recirculating system needed to be extended down to the garage, making the loop longer.</p>



<p>The plumber said that he could replace the on-demand gas unit with a similar one in a couple of days, but it would take a week or so to obtain a heat pump unit, which would also cost considerably more. We had to make a snap decision because we didn’t want to be without hot water any longer than necessary. Wanting to be good ecological citizens, we opted for the heat pump unit despite the cost, complexity, and delay in installation.</p>



<p>As promised, the plumber obtained the heat pump water heater, an <a href="https://americanstandardwaterheaters.com/product/hybrid-heat-pump-water-heater/">American Standard</a> 50-gallon unit (model ASHPWH-50). Installation took about two days and involved running a considerable amount of pipe from the old location in the attic to the new location in the garage, installing a new 30-ampere 220-volt electrical circuit at the heater, and bracing against earthquakes. The installation went well, except a defective water leak sensor had to be bypassed.</p>



 First Impressions 



<p>The first thing I noticed about the new water heater was its significant noise. The specification sheet listed it as emitting 40.1 dBA, which is about the same as a refrigerator’s (and also an implausibly specific value). However, the water heater was much louder than this.</p>



<p>The on-demand water heater spoiled us: we never ran out of hot water. We soon found that not to be the case with the new water heater, and I turned the water volume for my showers much lower than before. Perhaps scarcity is a good thing.</p>



<p>The new water heater is a “hybrid” unit with a heat pump and also a conventional heating element. It has several modes: </p>



 
 Green (heat pump only) 



 Comfort (“rational use of the heat pump and, if necessary, the heating element”) 



 Fast (heat pump + heating element) 



 i-Memory (“learns your habits and replicates them autonomously”) 



 Electric (heating element only) 
 



<p>There’s also a Boost mode, which is like Fast, but reverts to the previous mode when it gets up to temperature. Initially, it was set for Comfort, but I couldn’t understand when it was and wasn’t running the heating element. I asked product support and the installer, but I still couldn’t make sense of Comfort mode, so we changed to Green. I manually turn on the Boost feature when we need extra hot water.</p>



 The noise issue 



<p>The noise generated by the water heater was bothersome, especially since it was noticeable in my office adjacent to the garage. I downloaded a sound level measurement app on my phone. I sent a video to American Standard (actually Ariston) product support. They told me I had not measured it under the right conditions. Of course, my garage is not an anechoic chamber.</p>



<p>I consulted “the internet” and found conflicting answers about the noise generated by heat pump water heaters. Some comments described them as very noisy, and others found them quite acceptable. I tried to find others locally with similar water heaters for comparison and failed. In late 2024, the behavior of the water heater changed: sometimes it had a loud “whirr,” and sometimes it didn’t. This prompted me to make several recordings of the sound (and analyze it with a spectrum analyzer app) and determine that much of the excess noise was coming from the fan in the heat pump. I again contacted product support, and they agreed to ship me a replacement fan. My plumber replaced it, and the noise is much better now.</p>



 The app 



<p>Like many new devices, the water heater connects to the internet through my WiFi and, through a cloud service, allows an app on my phone to control and monitor it. The app, called Comfort Link, is acceptable but less than excellent.</p>



<p>Good:</p>



 
 Allows me to remotely control the water heater, including turning on Boost mode when needed and turning off the water heater when we’re on vacation 



 Displays the water heater temperature so I can judge whether to take a shower 



 Shows the history of power usage by the water heater by month, day, and hour 
 



<p>Not so good:</p>



 
 The water heater has an icon that appears when it judges when it’s OK to shower. This isn’t on the app, but it would be very useful. 



 The water heater temperature shown on the app doesn’t agree with that shown on the water heater. The support people explained that the water heater has several temperature sensors, and the app displays (I think) the average between the tank top and tank bottom temperature. But that doesn’t explain why the front panel displays something different. 



 Limited history of power usage data (e.g., daily data for only the current and previous month) 



 Poor resolution of power usage data. Measurements seem only to be taken only once per hour, so the heating element usage is reported in 4.5 kWh increments and the heat pump in 0.5 kWh increments. 



 There seems to be no API to download data other than through the app. 
 



 Efficiency 



<p>The heat pump is indeed more efficient than the electric heating element. This is suggested by the usage graph, where the orange bars represent energy usage from the heating element:</p>



<a href="https://altmode.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/img_1319.jpg"></a>



<p>But of course, the days we used the heating element are also days where I turned on Boost mode because we were using more hot water, which exaggerates the difference. I measured the tank temperature over time as it heated up:</p>



 
 Heating element (4.5 kW): temperature rise 68.9°F/hr = 15.3°F/kWh 



 Heat pump (0.45 kW): temperature rise 17.3°F/hr = 38.7°F/kWh (77°F ambient) 



 Heat pump (0.45 kW): temperature rise 11.9°F/hr = 26.5°F/kWh (61°F ambient) 



 Heat pump (0.45 kW): temperature rise 11.4°F/hr = 25.3°F/kWh (57°F ambient) 
 



<p>As expected, the heat pump’s efficiency depends on the ambient temperature, which determines the amount of heat the heat pump can “harvest” from the air. Compared with the heating element, the heat pump’s overall efficiency ranges from a factor of 1.65 to 2.53.</p>



 Operating cost 



<p>The heat pump water heater is efficient, but is it more cost-effective than our previous gas water heater? As noted above, it isn’t possible to make an exact comparison because we don’t know how our usage may have changed. If we make the worst-case assumption that our usage hasn’t changed, we are now using an average of about 5.3 kWh per day (153 kWh/month divided by 29 days). At an off-peak rate of $0.44/kWh, that works out to $2.33/day. Counting only those days where we used only the heat pump, that’s about 4 kWh/day or $1.76/day. Before getting the new water heater, our gas usage was about 8 therms/month, virtually all of which was for hot water. At our current rate of about $2.50/therm, that works out to $20/month or $0.67/day.</p>



<p>As our plumber had hinted when we installed the new water heater, gas is relatively inexpensive compared to electricity at current prices (unless you’re generating your own electricity). While an electric heat pump water heater is efficient and ecologically responsible, don’t expect it to save you money at current rates.</p>

<p>Client assertions is a method of client authentication which can be used in OpenID Connect. This provides an alternative to client secrets. This approach enhances security by using signed tokens (JWTs) to authenticate clients during the token request process or the OAuth PAR request. In ASP.NET Core, client assertions is not supported per default, a small implementation is required.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/oidc-client-assertion">https://github.com/damienbod/oidc-client-assertion</a></p>



<p></p>



 Setup 



<p>A client assertion can be added to the token request which is sent from the ASP.NET Core backend to the OpenID Connect server. This is sent instead of the a client secret. The client is authenticated using the assertion. If using OAuth, the assertion is sent in the PAR request.</p>







<p></p>



 Create client assertion JWT 



<p>The application uses Microsoft Entra ID as the OpenID Connect server and the identity provider. The assertion was created using the Microsoft documentation.</p>



<p>Original src: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/msal/dotnet/acquiring-tokens/web-apps-apis/confidential-client-assertions#crafting-the-assertion">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/msal/dotnet/acquiring-tokens/web-apps-apis/confidential-client-assertions#crafting-the-assertion</a></p>



<p>A X509Certificate2 is used to create the certificate and validate the certificate. The audience, the clientId and the sub claims are sent in the JWT client assertion as well as the standard claims signed with the private key of the certificate used to validate the assertion in Microsoft Entra ID. As always, if using this against a different OpenID Connect server, JWT will be validated differently. Microsoft Entra ID requires a RSA key size 2048. </p>


  
public static class CertService
{
    public static string GetSignedClientAssertion(
          X509Certificate2 certificate, string aud, string clientId)
    {
        // no need to add exp, nbf as JsonWebTokenHandler will add them by default.
        var claims = new Dictionary&lt;string, object&gt;()
        {
            { "aud", aud },
            { "iss", clientId },
            { "jti", Guid.NewGuid().ToString() },
            { "sub", clientId }
        };

        var securityTokenDescriptor = new SecurityTokenDescriptor
        {
            Claims = claims,
            SigningCredentials = new X509SigningCredentials(certificate)
        };

        var handler = new JsonWebTokenHandler();
        var signedClientAssertion = handler.CreateToken(securityTokenDescriptor);

        return signedClientAssertion;
    }
}
  


<p></p>



<p>Using Micrsoft Entra ID as the OpenID Connect server, the client assertion is created using the token endpoint. In production, the certificate can be generated using Azure Key Vault. The certificate can also be read from the operating system store. This can all be set in the app.settings.</p>


          // single tenant
        var aud = $"https://login.microsoftonline.com/{builder.Configuration["AzureAd:TenantId"]!}/oauth2/v2.0/token";

        var clientAssertion = CertService.GetSignedClientAssertion(
            X509CertificateLoader.LoadPkcs12FromFile("cert_rsa512.pfx", "1234"),
            aud,
            builder.Configuration["AzureAd:ClientId"]!);
  


<p></p>



 Use the client assertion in the OpenID connect client 



<p>Once ready, the OnAuthorizationCodeReceived event can be used to added the assertion in the OpenID Connect client. If using PAR, the par event is used.</p>


  builder.Services.AddAuthentication(OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
    .AddCookie(CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
    .AddOpenIdConnect(OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme, oidcOptions =&gt;
    {
        oidcOptions.SignInScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
        oidcOptions.Scope.Add(OpenIdConnectScope.OpenIdProfile);
        oidcOptions.Scope.Add("user.read");
        oidcOptions.Scope.Add(OpenIdConnectScope.OfflineAccess);
        oidcOptions.Authority 
         = $"https://login.microsoftonline.com/{builder.Configuration["AzureAd:TenantId"]}/v2.0/";
        oidcOptions.ClientId = builder.Configuration["AzureAd:ClientId"];
        //oidcOptions.ClientSecret = builder.Configuration["AzureAd:ClientSecret"];
        oidcOptions.ResponseType = OpenIdConnectResponseType.Code;
        oidcOptions.MapInboundClaims = false;
        oidcOptions.SaveTokens = true;
        oidcOptions.TokenValidationParameters.NameClaimType 
          = JwtRegisteredClaimNames.Name;
        oidcOptions.TokenValidationParameters.RoleClaimType = "role";

        oidcOptions.Events = new OpenIdConnectEvents
        {
            // Add client_assertion            
            OnAuthorizationCodeReceived = context =&gt;
            {
                context.TokenEndpointRequest!.ClientAssertion = clientAssertion;
                context.TokenEndpointRequest.ClientAssertionType 
                 = "urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer";
                return Task.FromResult(0);
            }
        };
    });
  


<p></p>



 Setup Entra ID App registration 



<p>An Azure App registration is used to authenticate using Micrsoft Entra ID. The public key of the certificate can be uploaded to to the App registration. </p>







<p></p>



<p>Client assertions can be used for any OpenID Connect confidential client if the OpenID Connect server supports this. The assertion can be sent in the token request or in the PAR request depending on the flavor of the OpenID Connect code flow used.</p>



 Creating the certificate 



<p>The github <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/oidc-client-assertion/blob/main/CreateSelfSignedCertsConsole/Program.cs">repository</a> linked at the top, provides an example to create your own certificate which can be used in this flow. You can also use Azure Key vault or any other tool to create the certificate.</p>

So I could not be more excited to have Dr. Nicole Forsgren on the podcast. Nicole is the creator of the widely adopted DORA and SPACE frameworks, co-author of the award-winning book Accelerate and the DevOps Handbook (2nd edition), and author of the State of DevOps reports. She is currently a Partner at Microsoft Research, leading developer productivity research and strategy, and is currently working on a book about developer experience with Abi Noda. It’s safe to say that Nicole is one of the foremost experts in developer productivity — if not the foremost expert.</p><p>In this episode, we discuss:</p>  <p>Why PRs and Diffs are incomplete as a solo metric and how to view them in context</p>  <p>The importance of a holistic set of metrics for evaluating productivity</p>  <p>An overview of DORA’s four key metrics, its strengths, and its limitations</p>  <p>The evolution of processes and tools since DORA, including SPACE</p>  <p>What developer experience is—and concrete ways to improve it</p>  <p>Common characteristics of highly productive engineering teams</p>  <p>How faster onboarding might challenge Brook’s Law</p>  <p>How AI tooling is impacting developer productivity and best practices for experimentation</p>  <p>And much more!</p>       Takeaways <p>My biggest takeaways from this episode:</p><p>1. Measuring the number of PRs is controversial for a good reason. Measuring any single one “output” can be misused: and when devs know it is being measured, they will optimize for it.</p><p>However, measuring PRs is important: but to do it well, don’t look at it as an individual performance metric. Instead, use it to understand how well (or not well) systems across the team and company are working. For example, what systems are getting in the way of PRs taking long to merge?</p><p>2. DORA and SPACE both have their own limitations. DORA is very well-defined in the metrics it measures. However, a massive limitation it has is how it only measures from commit to production.</p><p>SPACE can be used to measure the complete developer workflow – including e.g. planning, coding, and even post-release. In turn, it is a more vague framework where you need to put in more effort to make it useful for your envirnment.</p><p>3. AI developer tools don’t change DevEx fundamentals. DORA and SPACE are still relevant. AI tools might be able to improve iteration speed, or make certain tasks more helpful. It’s really an open question how exactly this will play out. There’s a fair chance these tools significantly change how we do development. So if you’re a dev: experiment with them!</p><p>4. Developer experience (DevEx) is not necessarily great at large companies and poor at startups. Google is known to have standout developer experience thanks to so much investment it put into systems – but not all large companies are like this!</p><p>Startups have less resources to invest specifically in improving DevEx: but then again, they have less infrastructure in-place! The more custom infrastructure you have, the more painful DevEx tends to be (and the more in-house tools need to be built to mitigate this)</p> The Pragmatic Engineer deepdives relevant for this episode   <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/measuring-developer-productivity-bae">Measuring Developer Productivity: Real-World Examples</a></p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/developer-productivity-a-new-framework">A new way to measure developer productivity – from the creators of DORA and SPACE</a></p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/linkedin-engineering-efficiency">Measuring Engineering Efficiency at LinkedIn</a></p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/uber-eng-productivity">How Uber is Measuring Engineering Productivity</a></p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/engineering-productivity">Measuring software engineering productivity</a></p>   Timestamps <p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WufjP_WRnPM&amp;t=0s">00:00</a>) Intro</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WufjP_WRnPM&amp;t=123s">02:03</a>) PRs and Diffs and how to view them in the right context</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WufjP_WRnPM&amp;t=462s">07:42</a>) EngThrive at Microsoft</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WufjP_WRnPM&amp;t=626s">10:26</a>) The importance of having a holistic set of metrics in evaluating productivity</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WufjP_WRnPM&amp;t=1020s">17:00</a>) The four key metrics of DORA</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WufjP_WRnPM&amp;t=1437s">23:57</a>) The evolution of processes and tools since DORA, including SPACE</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WufjP_WRnPM&amp;t=1600s">26:40</a>) An explanation of developer experience — and ways to improve it</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WufjP_WRnPM&amp;t=1844s">30:44</a>) Devex at startups vs. larger companies</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WufjP_WRnPM&amp;t=2060s">34:20</a>) Why measuring developer productivity is so difficult</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WufjP_WRnPM&amp;t=2345s">39:05</a>) How to make a case for platform teams</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WufjP_WRnPM&amp;t=2674s">44:34</a>) Common characteristics of highly productive teams</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WufjP_WRnPM&amp;t=3061s">51:01</a>) Brook’s law and how faster onboarding might make it irrelevant</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WufjP_WRnPM&amp;t=3169s">52:49</a>) Onboarding for internal transfers</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WufjP_WRnPM&amp;t=3258s">54:18</a>) Shifting culture towards technology first</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WufjP_WRnPM&amp;t=3516s">58:36</a>) How middle management can improve engineering culture</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WufjP_WRnPM&amp;t=3816s">1:03:36</a>) How AI tooling is impacting developer productivity</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WufjP_WRnPM&amp;t=4002s">1:06:42</a>) Potential use cases for AI</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WufjP_WRnPM&amp;t=4120s">1:08:40</a>) A case for experimenting with AI coding tools and how to maintain flow state</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WufjP_WRnPM&amp;t=4530s">1:15:30</a>) Rapid fire round</p> A summary of the conversation  Measuring Developer Productivity   <p>PRs and diffs can be both good and bad signals when measuring developer productivity. Many leaders focus on the traditional economic definition of productivity: the rate of output or output per input.</p>  <p>PRs can give a view into the work being done, but senior engineers may have lower PR output due to other responsibilities like unblocking others, architecture, mentoring, and recruitment. It's important to consider the context and who is being measured.</p>  <p>A constellation of metrics is better than a single metric for a holistic view. So yes: it can be helpful to get data on PRs – as long as you get a lot more other data points as well!</p>    <p>Microsoft's EngThrive: this framework (which Nicole works on) uses multiple metrics across dimensions, inspired by the SPACE framework, alongside qualitative feedback.</p>  <p>Easy-to-operationalise measures can be useful. However, they only show a few things and may ignore important aspects.</p>  <p>SPACE: a framework that groups metrics into:</p>  <p>Satisfaction</p>  <p>Performance</p>  <p>Activity</p>  <p>Communication</p>  <p>Efficiency.</p>  <p>Nicole is a co-author of the framework. It’s one that is getting a lot wider adaptation. See <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/122054454/dora-space-and-the-need-for-a-new-approach">an overview of the SPACE framework</a></p>    <p>Absent engineering leadership is unhelpful. No matter what metrics you use: if engineering leadership is not connected with the work, outcomes are likely to be a lot worse.</p>  <p>Metrics collected in a holistic way, on the other hand, can guide decisions about company-wide blockers.</p>   DORA frameworkand its evolution   <p>Nicole is the co-creator of DORA</p>  <p>DORA can refer to the entire research program. More frequently though, people tend to refer to the 4 DORA metrics:</p>  <p>Deployment frequency</p>  <p>Lead time for changes</p>  <p>Change failure rate,</p>  <p>Time to restore service</p>    <p>These 4 metrics are a good indicator of how well a development pipeline is working</p>  <p>DORA can be adapted for different environments, such as air-gapped systems, by redefining the scope of the deployment pipeline.</p>  <p>DORA does not show the full picture. DORA metrics serve as a signal for how well a team is doing, but it does not show the complete picture. DORA focuses on commit to production. This is a part of the engineering process that can be made pretty efficient.</p>  <p>Fast feedback is important, as is the ability to set up environments and provision resources quickly.</p>  <p>SPACE evolved from DORA. SPACE considers the entire end-to-end toolchain. SPACE metrics can be applied to specific components, like PRs. DORA is essentially one of many instances of SPACE.</p>   Developer Experience   <p>Developer experience is a developer's lived experience. This can be “good” – it can also be “bad!”</p>  <p>A good developer experience minimises friction, blockers, and confusion</p>  <p>Security and compliance: these are important! However, automation can minimise manual processes for developers. A secure and compliant dev process does not need to be cumbersome.</p>  <p>Delays and cognitive load from inefficient processes negatively affect developer experience.</p>  <p>Both large and small companies can have good or bad developer experiences. Large companies have more resources but may struggle with legacy systems and bureaucracy. Startups can move fast but lack infrastructure. Google has an exceptional developer experience because they invest in it and don't tolerate friction.</p>   Improving Engineering Teams   <p>Most work in software is invisible, and systems are increasingly complex.</p>  <p>Leaders and executives often don't feel the pain of developers.</p>  <p>To make a case for investment in tooling: use both data and stories. Present the trade-offs realistically.</p>  <p>Acknowledge that there's a tipping point where further investments won't deliver much more progress.</p>  <p>Frame requests in terms of trade-offs and potential for repurposing teams.</p>    <p>High-performing teams:</p>  <p>Exhibit psychological safety, curiosity, and openness to better ways of doing things.</p>  <p>Onboarding time is a great indicator of team efficiency.</p>  <p>A “dummy pull request” early during the onboarding phase (e.g. day 1!) can significantly increase productivity. Try it!</p>  <p>If onboarding is slow: adding people to a late project can backfire. But if onboarding is fast: this can actually work!</p>      <p>Engineering culture transformations:</p>  <p>These require changing the entire company culture, not just the tech culture.</p>  <p>Changing how people do their work can lead to cultural impacts.</p>  <p>Introducing faster tools and ways of working changes people's lived experience.</p>  <p>To improve the engineering culture, summarize observations, seek feedback, and involve others in finding improvements.</p>  <p>Aim for quick wins with visible impact, like hack days to address paper cuts.</p>     Impact of AI on Developer Productivity   <p>DORA and SPACE relevance:</p>  <p>DORA metrics should remain relevant</p>  <p>SPACE is still applicable for assessing satisfaction, performance, activity, communication, and efficiency.</p>    <p>Changes AI is likely to bring:</p>  <p>There’s some chance that AI tools einvent development and software engineering, particularly in IDEs and testing.</p>  <p>Coding assistants: AI-powered ones can improve code readability and unit test success rates</p>  <p>PR reviews: an obvious place for AI to help</p>  <p>Support roles like release engineering and deployment: could be a use case</p>    <p>Experiment with AI!</p>  <p>Experimenting with AI tools and adapt to your workflows.</p>  <p>Assess AI tools to see what works, and focus on problem-solving and architecture.</p>  <p>When you find the workflows where AI is helpful: you might be able to preserve flow better</p>  <p>Turn off autocomplete and autosuggestions if they are an interruption!.</p>    <p>Consider AI as a different way to work, such as "driving and reviewing" or "guiding".</p>  <p>LLMs are changing software engineering rapidly.</p>   Book recommendations <p>Nicole recommends reading:</p>  <p><a href="https://www.svpg.com/books/inspired-how-to-create-tech-products-customers-love-2nd-edition/">Inspired</a> by Marty Cagan</p>  <p><a href="https://peterattiamd.com/outlive/">Outlive</a> by Peter Attia</p>  <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Enders-Game-Ender-Quintet-1/dp/1250773024">Ender's Game</a> for some good fiction reading</p>   Resources &amp;

<p>It’s the end of an era: after eight incredible years, it felt like the right time to close the chapter on my story at <a href="http://www.uniken.com">Uniken</a>. When <a href="https://www.streetinsider.com/Press+Releases/Uniken+Announces+Nishant+Kaushik+as+Chief+Technology+Officer/12739642.html">I joined as CTO</a>, Uniken was an ambitious startup with a unique core technology and a vision to make a global impact. What made the ensuing journey so rewarding was the team – exceptionally talented, deeply committed, and relentlessly innovative. Together, we navigated complex challenges, scaled through uncertainty (including a global pandemic), and built Uniken into a global cybersecurity leader with customer engagements on every continent (except Antarctica, because sadly it would appear that penguins aren’t really concerned about digital trust).&nbsp;</p>



<p>I am incredibly proud of the team, and the platform we built – one that empowers businesses to engage securely and seamlessly with their customers, and creates lasting value for our customers and partners.&nbsp; I want to express my deepest gratitude to my colleagues and partners at Uniken. Our collaborative efforts transformed the company and positioned it for long-term success, and I look forward to seeing you scale new heights.</p>

<p>Last week, we looked into data from global hiring agency Indeed that found software development job listings are <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-pulse-124">at a five-year low</a>. To check how representative (or not) these numbers are of the tech jobs market, I pinged some tech recruiters. The response was not what I expected:</p><blockquote><p>“I can only talk about our own niche from seed-stage to Series C engineering recruitment, but we’ve never had so many positions to fill as in 2024.” – Asher Hoffman, cofounder of <a href="https://www.coastalrecruiting.co/">Coastal Recruiting</a></p><p>“In 2024, every month was a step up in the number of job searches we did for CTO, VP of engineering, director of engineering and product leadership positions. It just kept going up. 2024 was our second-best year ever for the number of searches done: only 2021 was better, and that was an incredible year; the peak of the job market.” – Glenn Murphy, managing partner at <a href="https://www.rivierapartners.com/">Riviera Partners</a></p></blockquote><p>These data points stick out and I was eager to learn more; after all, they’re bucking the trend in Indeed’s figures, with rising demand for tech professionals! I met Asher and Glenn to get their perspectives, and they also offered some tactics for engineers and engineering leaders to use when seeking new opportunities. Today, we cover:</p>  <p>What are boutique recruiters? Also, the differences between contingent and retained ones.</p>  <p>Hiring by tech stack at early-stage startups. Fifty percent of hires are backend, 25% fullstack, 10-15% AI/ML, and 5% are frontend. A big surprise is virtually no demand for native mobile developers, or for the .NET and Java tech stacks. Also, very few mentions of Angular or Vue.</p>  <p>More demand than before at Coastal and Riviera. Both recruitment businesses are seeing more engineering jobs to be filled coming their way.</p>  <p>Changes across the market. More money and demand from early-stage VC-funded startups, and private equity becoming more dominant in driving demand for engineering executive hiring.</p>  <p>Startups want ‘cracked’ engineers. These are professionals with a track record of ownership, curiosity, and the ability to “grind.” Length of experience doesn't matter after around the 2-year point.</p>  <p>Demand for engineering leadership positions. Data indicates that large parts of the job market are struggling more than the senior role segment, with director of engineering roles hardest to fill.</p>  <p>What search processes look like. Recruitment experts explain how a typical software engineer search and engineering executive search plays out.</p>  <p>For updates on how these two recruiters see the market, follow <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/asherhoffman/">Asher Hoffman</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/glennmurphy24/">Glenn Murphy</a> on LinkedIn.</p><p>A quick programming note: there will be no The Pulse on Thursday — I’m taking a short winter break. More details in my <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/about#§publishing-schedule-and-holidays">publishing schedule</a>.</p> 1. What are boutique recruiters? <p>Coastal Recruiting and Riviera Partners are specialized recruitment agencies; also known as "boutique search”, “contingent”, “retained”, or “executive” recruiters.</p><p>“Boutique” and “specialized” refer to recruiters which focus on a niche within tech, such as:</p>  <p>Software engineer and AI+ML engineer hiring for early-stage startups (Coastal Recruitment)</p>  <p>Director-and-above engineering leadership, and product/design leadership for scaleups and larger companies (Riviera Partners)</p>  <p>Executive recruitment is a subset of boutique recruitment. These companies recruit for executive roles like director of engineering, VP of engineering, head of engineering, CTO roles, etc. In the US, high-profile firms can charge $100K or more to recruit a key position like CTO for a late-stage scaleup.</p><p>Executive recruitment firms can also focus on individual contributor (IC) roles. Glenn Murphy advises that this usually happens only in the US at their firm, and comes with tradeoffs. For example, the cost becomes justifiable only when the vacancy’s comp package is several times higher than the search cost; usually $500K and above. It is this niche area in which an expert executive recruiter can make the most impact by finding truly standout candidates.</p><p>Within the boutique search sector, there are two main types of recruiter:</p> Contingent recruiters <p>These companies work on a “no hire, no fee” basis, and only get paid for successfully filling a position; usually 10-40% of the role’s first-year salary. This service is an easy sell; it’s low risk financially for an employer to work with a contingent recruiter due to no-hire-no-fee. Contingent recruiters also often have more clients than retained ones do.</p><p>Coastal Recruiting mostly does contingent recruitment, with a couple of retained contracts. This company specializes in hiring software engineers from the first hire to engineer number 20 to 30 at early-stage startups. In 2024 they worked with around 100 different startups.</p> Retained recruiters <p>Most executive recruitment companies operate a retainer model and charge upfront, regardless of whether a hire is made. Payment comes in a fixed number of instalments, perhaps in this order:</p>  <p>Initial retainer: the first third of the fee, paid at the start.</p>  <p>Progress retainer: second payment, usually tied to milestones being hit, such as:</p>  <p>Presenting a shortlist of qualified candidates who are ready to engage</p>  <p>Completing screening interviews and drawing up a interview shortlist of preferred candidates</p>  <p>Final interviews scheduled or completed</p>    <p>Final payment: upon successful placement. Depending on the agreement, there may be no payment if a candidate isn’t hired</p>  <p>A search company may also be paid monthly while conducting a search. Total retainer fees are usually 25-50% of the value of the successful candidate’s comp, which increases the more challenging the search is. For example, it’s challenging to find a new CTO for a 300-person scaleup growing at a 10x pace, who is hands-on, has worked with AI / machine learning (ML) before, and who has experience at a hypergrowth company, and also in Big Tech. There aren’t too many people who fit this profile, and not many of them may be interested in switching jobs.</p><p>Guarantee periods can also be an important part of retained searches, under which a portion of the fee may be refunded should a successful candidate quits shortly afterwards.</p><p>Retained recruiters are a lot more expensive than contingent ones, and are the go-to choice for executive recruitment where vacancies may not even be publicly listed by an employer.</p><p>Riviera Partners is one of the best-known executive recruiter companies. They hire for director+ roles in engineering, product and design. In our deepdive <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/43780977/engineering-leadership-positions">Finding the next company to work at</a>, they were the most recommended exec recruiter firm by engineering leaders.</p><p>Seed-stage and early-stage startups typically only use executive recruiters to hire for VP-and-above positions which report to the CEO. Later-stage startups also hire for director positions, and may pay for a search for senior-and-above hires and ICs. However, the cost means this is rare, happens mainly in the US, and by funded scaleups with very specific needs.</p><p>Given this process can be so expensive, it may not be immediately obvious what the upside is. Glenn explains:</p><blockquote><p>“We have 21 years worth of data and information on who has been successful, people’s interests and nuance that isn’t available on a LinkedIn profile.</p><p>We save companies a lot of time, in the end. This is due to the insights we have and our reach across the USA and Europe. We know what’s needed at Series A, all the way through to which profiles tend to succeed at publicly traded companies. We also have the know-how on how to interview people to assess if they’re up for the challenge.”</p></blockquote><p>Riviera’s pricing is atypical, compared to many other retained recruiters. Glenn shares:</p><blockquote><p>“We have time-based milestones as opposed to shortlists or incentives, which can be adjusted sometimes. However, for the most part, the fee is fully paid within 90 days.”</p></blockquote> 2. Hiring by tech stack at early-stage startups <p>At Coastal Recruiting, Asher hires early engineering teams at early-stage startups: from seed-stage startups to Series B and Series C companies. They work with some of the largest US VC investors (like a16z, Y Combinator, Sequoia, Index, Lightspeed, Founders Fund and others).</p> Types of engineers and tech stack <p>Asher sees the hiring demand split like this:</p><p>‘50% of hires we make are backend engineers. I don’t think this will always be the case for startup engineering. The first 3 hires for a company with technical cofounders are almost always backend engineers. It’s a bonus if they have some frontend skills, but I’d peg it at 80% backend, 20% frontend.</p><p>‘For backend tech stacks, these are the languages founders use, which candidates would be expected to pick up quickly. By popularity:</p>  <p>Typescript: easily the most common.</p>  <p>Python: surprisingly popular, usually with another language like Typescript or Go. I assume it’s because so much AI and ML work can be done with it, and it’s a generally useful language</p>  <p>Go: This has gotten somewhat more popular, over time</p>  <p>Rust: especially popular with crypto companies. About 15% of our portfolio is crypto, and Rust is very popular. We’re on the lookout for people with hands-on experience in Rust</p>  <p>Ruby: Out of around 100 clients in the past year, only 2 used Ruby; both of them are pretty big names. They told us “find us anyone who has touched Ruby or Ruby on Rails, and is good.”</p>  <p>Few to no mentions:</p>  <p>Flutter: we’ve gotten a single Flutter role in the past year</p>  <p>Elixir: once in a while, we have a startup that uses this and needs folks with experience with it. But it’s less common than Ruby.</p>  <p>Java / Scala: we don’t get any requests for this stack, at all. However, if someone has Java or Scala experience, and is open to working in Python, we usually move forward with them</p>  <p>C# / .NET: we’ve only come across a single hardware company asking for this in several years.</p>  <p>PHP: almost zero PHP these days</p>  <p>Haskell: it’s been a couple years since any company asked for this.</p>    <p>‘25% percent are fullstack. These roles almost exclusively employ the following technologies:</p>  <p>React for the frontend. React frameworks like Next or React Router are usually relevant. Overall, 95% of framework mentions are for React.</p>  <p>Typescript as the programming language. Of course, JavaScript is a given</p>  <p>Node as the backend framework</p>  <p>Python is often mentioned</p>  <p>React Native is by far the most popular mobile technology we see, often requested by mobile-first startups that build their app with it.</p>  <p>Angular / Vue: a combined 5% or less.</p>  <p>‘AI and ML is 10-15%,” says Asher. “This hire is almost always one of the first 10, and doesn’t need to be an “in-depth” ML specialist. They usually fit this profile:</p>  <p>Backend generalist</p>  <p>Has worked in an ML or AI-driven company</p>  <p>Is deep into what is going on in AI and how to use LLMs, practically</p>  <p>Hacked AI side-projects themselves. They probably hack on the side, and might use things like LangChain, LangGraph, and other popular LLM tools to play around with.</p>  <p>‘Someone we recently hired for such a role had worked for a year as an AI/ML engineer, not an in-depth, “research-caliber” ML candidate.</p><p>‘As startups grow and mature, eventually they tend to hire more in-depth ML and AI people. However, early-stage companies look for builders who can use AI tools effectively.</p><p>‘5% are frontend engineers. Almost universally, the seventh or eighth hire at a startup is the first frontend engineer. The reason almost always is – and I kid you not! – that the founder is fed up with owning the frontend themself, and is ready to bring in a frontend specialist.</p><p>‘Ironically, this role is one of the hardest to fill because technical founders whom we work with typically expect two things:</p>  <p>Be a great frontend person – this is easier to find</p>  <p>Be great at computer science basics – such as algorithms and CS fundamentals. This is why most people who pass #1 get rejected!</p>  <p>‘Another reason this role is so hard to fill is that the founder often looks for a staff-level frontend engineer. This person might be the first frontend hire, but they ideally want someone who will head up the frontend team, as it grows. It’s difficult to convince people with staff-plus frontend jobs at stable companies and who head up teams, to come and join an early-stage startup where they would be the only frontend person – at least at first!</p><p>‘The best startups are embracing AI – and look for devs who do the same. AI coding tools like Cursor and GitHub Copilot are used by all the best startups we recruit for. Founders at these startups often mention that mastering these tools can 10x the productivity of their engineers with faster iteration and the ability to parallelize work.</p><p>‘We don’t see demand for native mobile engineers at all; only React Native. We work with a few “mobile-first” startups who have built impressive mobile apps. All use React Native and look to hire for such experience.</p><p>‘I would assume native hires might become more important after the Series B or Series C rounds. In the early-stage in the US, they are absent – or at least, we see no such demand.’</p><p>Startups don’t care that much if you’ve used their exact stack before. Asher told me:</p><blockquote><p>“I hear over and over again, that a great engineer is a great engineer - and if you don't have experience in the companies current stack - as a talented engineer, you shouldn't have much trouble picking it up quickly. Thus - if your stack doesn't align perfectly with the above most used, it's okay - you can still get the role!”</p></blockquote> 3. More demand than before at Coastal and Riviera <p>Both recruitment companies are seeing record, or near-record business in terms of the number of searches executed.</p><p>More demand from early-stage, VC-funded startups. Asher says:</p><blockquote><p>“In my niche, I’m seeing more hiring than in recent memory.</p><p>I'm seeing many “cracked” engineers with 5+ offers on-hand, and well-funded startups forced to compete by upping their offers to hire the best of the best. I’m seeing higher total comp packages in the early stage space than ever.”</p><p>As we’ll detail below, “cracked” refers to someone with a track record of ownership, who displays curiosity and the ability to grind when needed.</p><p>Asher: “It feels like this is a great time for many folks to leave Big Tech and take a gamble – but not too big a pay cut. Big Tech has done many layoffs and the startups I work with offer similar pay, with a massive equity upside.</p><p>The risks an engineer used to have to take when joining a startup are shrinking in this new market. Well-funded startups are meeting engineers with competitive salaries, health and wellness, and equity. Also, founders are being much more upfront with recruits about their ARR (annual recurring revenue) and progress towards PMF (product-market-fit) than before.</p><p>A disclaimer: I recruit in just the VC-funded, early-stage start-up space, with startups founded by technical founders and backed by well-known VC firms. These are companies that have the money to hire, and a bold vision to build a billion-dollar company. It’s a narrow view of the market.”</p></blockquote><p>Will more companies increase recruitment? At Riviera partners, Glenn Murphy does engineering leadership searches for startups and scaleups. He shares:</p><blockquote><p>“We signed up 58% more searches in 2024 than in 2023 for the US. In Europe, the growth was 61%. The most common search assignment in both continents was for VP Engineering. It feels to me this alone signals a return to a focus on growing teams, as VPs of engineering are hired in preparation to scale up the team’s headcount.”</p></blockquote> 4. Changes across the market <p>I asked both Asher and Glenn what changes have been surprising in their part of the tech hiring market.</p>

<p>This post looks at customizing the sign-in UI and the sign-in options in an ASP.NET Core application using Duende IdentityServer and ASP.NET Core Identity. There are multiple ways of changing the look and feel of the UI for different OpenID Connect clients or different client flows. In the previous post, the UI was customized per client, this post customizes inside a single client.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/duende-multi-tenant">https://github.com/damienbod/duende-multi-tenant</a></p>

 <a href="https://damienbod.com/2025/02/03/multiple-client-sign-in-customizations-using-duende-identity-provider/">Multiple client sign-in customizations using Duende identity provider</a> 



 Customizing a single client sign-in using parameters in Duende IdentityServer 
 



 Setup 



<p>The solution is setup using three different ASP.NET Core applications. In the example code, the “admin” application has different federation authentication options compared to the “shop” client authentication sign-in experience. The client ID from the authentication context is used to customize the look and feel, i.e. the styles, the layout and the options of the client are used to define which federation and authentication options are possible. The shop client can be further customized using authentication parameters sent in the OpenID Connect redirect.</p>







<p></p>



 OIDC client implementation 



<p>In ASP.NET Core the OpenID Connect flow implementation provides multiple events which can be changed or extended. The OnRedirectToIdentityProvider can be used to send custom parameters to the OpenID Connect server. The OAuth Pushed authorization request on top of OpenID Connect Core is used used per default in .NET 9, if the OpenID Connect server supports this.</p>


  builder.Services.AddAuthentication(options =&gt;
{
    options.DefaultScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    options.DefaultChallengeScheme = OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
})
.AddCookie()
.AddOpenIdConnect(options =&gt;
{
    options.SignInScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    // other options ...

    options.Events = new OpenIdConnectEvents
    {
        OnRedirectToIdentityProvider = context =&gt;
        {
            context.ProtocolMessage.SetParameter("showadminsignin", "false");

            return Task.FromResult(0);
        }
    };
});
  


<p></p>



 Duende sign-in customization 



<p>In the previous post, a new sign-in UI was created for each client. The shop client has further customization. In this demo, the admin external provider can be hidden or displayed depending on what the client requests. The UI is implemented using ASP.NET Core Razor pages and a BindProperty is used for this.</p>


  [BindProperty]
public bool ShowAdminSignIn { get; set; } = true;
  


<p></p>



<p>When processes the authentication using Duende and ASP.NET Core Identity, the GetAuthorizationContextAsync method can be used to get the client requested parameters.</p>


  var context = await _interaction.GetAuthorizationContextAsync(returnUrl);
ShowAdminSignIn = !(context?.Parameters["showadminsignin"] == "false");
  


<p></p>



<p>The UI can implement any display logic using the client parameters sent in the request. In this demo, the admin UI is hidden or displayed using the client request data.</p>


  @foreach (var provider in Model.View.VisibleExternalProviders)
{
 if (!(!Model.ShowAdminSignIn &amp;&amp; 
	(provider.AuthenticationScheme == "AdminEntraID")))
 {
	 &lt;li class="list-inline-item"&gt;
		 &lt;a class="btn btn-secondary"
			asp-page="/ExternalLogin/Challenge"
			asp-route-scheme="@provider.AuthenticationScheme"
			asp-route-returnUrl="@Model.Input.ReturnUrl"&gt;
			 @provider.DisplayName
		 &lt;/a&gt;
	 &lt;/li&gt;
 }
}
  


<p></p>



 Notes 



<p>This is an easy approach to implement UI customization on a per client basis. The is UI logic and not authorization. The different options  are just hidden or removed from the UI using the client parameters, the logic MUST not work if this is a security requirement. This is not authorization.</p>

<p>The Pulse is <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/s/the-pulse">a series</a> covering insights, patterns, and trends within Big Tech and startups. Notice an interesting event or trend? <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/contact/">Send me a message</a>.</p><p>Today, we cover:</p>  <p>Industry pulse. OpenAI struggles to shed nonprofit status, Anthropic bans AI from job applications, cuts at Workday, GitHub Copilot releases an agentic mode, and Linus Torvalds tells Linux contributors that social media pressure is bad for development.</p>  <p>Software engineering job openings hit five-year low? There are 35% fewer software developer job listings on Indeed today, than five years ago. Compared to other industries, job listings for software engineers grew much more in 2021-2022, but have declined much faster since. A look into possible reasons for this, and what could come next.</p>  <p>OpenAI responds to DeepSeek threat. Fresh off the shock of a relatively unknown Chinese company dethroning ChatGPT as the most-downloaded AI app on iPhone and Android, OpenAI has shaken itself up, promptly copied DeepSeek’s visualization of how its reasoning model “thinks”, and has shipped Deep Research.</p>   <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff54b9bde-a363-4237-8209-89d04a15e62a_1600x738.png">          </a>A glimpse from the section “Software engineering job openings hit five-year low?”  OpenAI struggles to shed nonprofit status <p>Yet more drama at OpenAI, where cofounder Elon Musk has made a $97 billion dollar bid to take over the OpenAI nonprofit. A few details to unpack:</p>  <p>Yes, Musk really is one of the several cofounders of OpenAI. In 2015 it was he, Sam Altman, and 9 others (Greg Brockman, Ilya Sutskever, John Schulman, Wojciech Zaremba, Trevor Blackwell, Vicki Cheung, Andrej Karpathy, Durk Kingma, and Pamela Vagata)</p>  <p>Musk contributed around $45M to OpenAI as a donor, as <a href="https://openai.com/index/openai-elon-musk/">confirmed</a> by OpenAI.</p>  <p>In 2017, things got messy and Musk eventually left OpenAI. This was the year when OpenAI decided to create a for-profit entity, controlled by the nonprofit. As <a href="https://openai.com/index/openai-elon-musk/">shared by</a> OpenAI, Musk wanted control over the for-profit part, and then later wanted to merge it into Tesla.</p>  <p>Musk created rival X.AI in 2023, and this company has raised $6B of funding.</p>  <p>OpenAI is worth a lot more than $97B; its latest valuation was at $157B <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/149770356/openai-biggest-ever-fundraise-as-key-people-keep-quitting">in October</a>, and there are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/technology/openai-softbank-investment.html">rumors</a> of a new raise at or above $300B!</p><p>Here’s where OpenAI’s tricky corporate structure comes into play. OpenAI published a diagram showcasing the structure, but leaving out ownership stakes. Here’s my interpretation, focusing on ownership stakes and control:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76dfe414-3767-42e7-883a-63a629ecbba0_1548x1182.png">          </a>OpenAI’s ownership structure. It’s messy. <p>Musk is offering to buy the nonprofit entity, not the for-profit one. Musk’s offer at $97B for a 51% controlling share values OpenAI at around $195B, which is higher than OpenAI’s last valuation of $157B. The company’s board has a fiduciary duty to consider the offer. However, OpenAI is officially a non-profit, so this duty may not apply.</p><p>It’s likely that this episode’s main impact will be to highlight the ridiculous, convoluted, corporate structure of the world’s most valuable private company. I wonder if investors may opt against investing more until this structure is tidied up, with the for-profit entity controlled by investors, and not the nonprofit, with ` investors receiving an ownership stake as well.</p> Anthropic bans AI from job applications

 実際のセッションの概要：AIメタバース時代のアイデンティティ 対談メモ 



 概要 



 
 イベント名: デジタルスペースカンファレンス2025の一環 



 日時: 2025年2月27日 



 場所: 東京ミッドタウン（現地）およびYouTubeライブ配信 



 出演者:
 
 バーチャル美少女ねむ（メタバース住人、VRコンテンツクリエイター） 



 崎村夏彦氏（OpenID Foundation理事長） 
 
 



 テーマ: AIメタバース時代のアイデンティティ 
 



 主要ポイント 



 1. メタバースの現状と可能性 



 
 メタバース環境の説明:
 
 VRゴーグルとフェイストラッカー等を使用した没入型体験 



 物理的制約を超えた活動が可能（サイズ変更、重力無効化など） 



 実際の書斎のような環境をVR上につくり、その中でも様々な活動が可能 



 Meta Quest 3s等の低価格ヘッドセットの登場により普及が加速 



 「魔法が使える世界」として例えられる（瞬間移動、物の生成など） 
 
 



 VRの技術的利点:
 
 光学的には遠くを見る状態になるため、目の疲れが少ない 



 物理的な制約にとらわれない創造性 



 複数のアバターを使い分け、異なる自己表現が可能 
 
 



 日本のVR人口:
 
 過去1年で約倍増 



 世界的に見ても日本人ユーザーの成長の割合が高い 
 
 
 



 2. デジタルアイデンティティと複数人格（分人） 



 
 アバターの種類と選択理由:
 
 人間型アバターは現実との近さで没入感を求める人が選択 



 ファンタジー系は現実では表現できない特性を求める人が選択 



 時間経過と共に人間型が減少し多様なアバターが増加傾向 
 
 



 デュアル・アイデンティティ:
 
 約57%のユーザーがバーチャルIDと現実の自分を意図的に分けている 



 分ける理由：偏見を避ける、現実と仮想を区別したい 



 公開する理由：ネットワーク拡大、現実と仮想の繋がりを求める 
 
 



 「分人（ぶんじん）経済」の概念:
 
 一人の人間が複数の人格・アイデンティティで活動する経済構造
 
 ちなみに、2011年に発行されたISO/IEC 24760-1ではすでに人々がコンテキストごとのアイデンティティを使い分けるとして、identity と partial identity を同義語として定義している。 
 
 



 現在は約13%がVR内のアイデンティティをメインと考え、27%が将来メイン化を望む 



 アイデンティティ切り替えによる自己表現と心理的効果 
 
 
 



 3. デジタルアイデンティティとプライバシーの課題 



 
 IdP（Identity Provider）の役割:
 
 オンライン認証の標準化（OpenID Connect等） 



 コンテキスト毎の適切なアイデンティティ管理 



 「混ぜるな危険」の原則：異なるアイデンティティは分離すべき 
 
 



 現在の制度的課題:
 
 バーチャルアイデンティティでの経済活動の困難さ（確定申告、金融取引など） 



 プライバシー保護と本人確認のバランス 



 全方位的アイデンティティの強制が問題 



 理想は「コンテキストごとの関係性に応じたアイデンティティの使い分け」 
 
 



 解決策の方向性:
 
 関係者に見える情報を必要最小限にする仕組み 



 事業者別識別子を国税庁にわたして税務用アイデンティティ（識別子はマイナンバー）に変換して処理する仕組み 



 パーソナルAIによる自動処理の可能性 
 
 
 



 4. 日本の可能性と今後の展望 



 
 日本の優位性:
 
 クリエイティブ活動への低いバリア（同人文化等） 



 VTuber文化やメタバース活動への高い受容性 



 メディアでのバーチャル存在の可視性が高い 
 
 



 今後の展望:
 
 技術的には実現可能な仕組みの社会実装 



 立法・行政への働きかけの必要性〜それには選挙民の声が必要 



 高齢化社会における新たな社会参加の形態 



 IDの仕組みの抜本的見直しによる新たな経済発展 
 
 
 



 結論 



<p>メタバースにおける複数アイデンティティ（分人）は技術的に既に可能だが、それを経済活動や社会制度と結びつけるための実装と法制度の発展が必要。日本はVR文化への親和性が高く、この分野でリーダーシップをとる可能性がある。メタバースを通じて「より自分らしく生きる」ための環境整備が今後の課題となる。</p>

Use the code PRAGMATIC to get one month free.</p><p>• <a href="http://augmentcode.com/pragmatic">Augment Code</a> — AI coding assistant that pro engineering teams love</p><p>—</p> In This Episode <p>How do you architect a live streaming system to deal with more load than any similar system has dealt with before? Today, we hear from an architect of such a system: Ashutosh Agrawal, formerly Chief Architect of JioCinema (and currently Staff Software Engineer at Google DeepMind.) In May 2023, JioCinema set the live-streaming world record, serving 32 million concurrent viewers tuning in to the finale of Indian Premier League (a cricket game.)</p><p>We take a deep dive into video streaming architecture, tackling the complexities of live streaming at scale (at tens of millions of parallel streams) and the challenges engineers face in delivering seamless experiences. We talk about the following topics:</p><p>• How large-scale live streaming architectures are designed</p><p>• Tradeoffs in optimizing performance</p><p>• Early warning signs of streaming failures and how to detect them</p><p>• Why capacity planning for streaming is SO difficult</p><p>• The technical hurdles of streaming in APAC regions</p><p>• Why Ashutosh hates APMs (Application Performance Management systems)</p><p>• Ashutosh’s advice for those looking to improve their systems design expertise</p><p>• And much more!</p>     Takeaways <p>My biggest takeaways from this episode:</p><p>1. The architecture behind live streaming systems is surprisingly logical. In the episode, Ashutosh explains how the live streaming system works, starting from the physical cameras on-site, through the production control room (PCR), streams being sliced-and-diced, and the HLS protocol (HTTP Live Streaming) used.</p><p>2. There are a LOT of tradeoffs you can play with when live streaming! The tradeoffs between server load, latency, server resources vs client caching are hard decisions to make. Want to reduce the server load? Serve longer chunks to clients, resulting in fewer requests per minute, per client… at the expense of clients potentially lagging more behind. This is just one of many possible decisions to make.</p><p>3. At massive video streaming scale, capacity planning can start a year ahead! It was surprising to hear how Ashutosh had to convince with telecoms and data centers to invest more in their server infrastructure, so they can handle the load, come peak viewership months later.

The team at Jio would simulate “game day” load months before the event. They did tell teams when the load test will start: but did not share anything else!

These cameras are connected by fiber to a Production Control Room (PCR).</p>  <p>In the PCR, a director selects which camera feeds to use, much like in a movie production.</p>    <p>Source feed (or production feed) is then sent to a contribution encoder. This encoder compresses the high-bandwidth source feed to a more manageable size.</p>  <p>The compressed feed is then transmitted to the cloud using a private peer-to-peer link.</p>    <p>Distribution encoder: prepares the stream in various formats for end-user consumption, such as HLS and DASH.</p>  <p>Over 100 stream variants can be generated for various devices – and up to 500 (!) when different languages are included.</p>    <p>Orchestrator: the one managing the pipeline, from the contribution encoding to the cloud infrastructure. The orchestrator decides which endpoints to push to, the configuration of the distribution encoder, and the CDN endpoints.</p>  <p>Playback URLs: generated by the orchestrator. URLs are specific to the device and format being used.</p>    <p>When a user clicks play, a separate playback system takes over. This system verifies user authorization, deals with encryption, and handles Digital Rights Management (DRM). The playback system then provides the client app with an encrypted URL to stream the content.</p>  <p>Live streaming systems are more complex than Video on Demand (VOD) systems because of the need to manage multiple real-time streams and user authentication and authorization for those streams, all while keeping latency low.</p>   Content Delivery   <p>Content delivery relies on Content Delivery Networks (CDNs).</p>  <p>The core technology used is HLS or DASH, where the video is broken down into segments.</p>  <p>HLS uses a master manifest file (e.g., master.m3u8) that lists different video quality levels. Each quality level refers to a child manifest.</p>  <p>Child manifests list individual video segments. These segments are typically between four to six seconds long.</p>  <p>The client player requests a child manifest every segment duration and the segments that it lists.</p>    <p>CDN: works at the segment level rather than at a millisecond level.</p>  <p>Correctly setting up CDN configurations, such as the Time To Live (TTL) values for the cached segments, is crucial to ensure a smooth stream without stale data.</p>    <p>Latency is introduced at various stages of the live-streaming process. This includes encoding, network transmission, and client-side buffering.</p>  <p>Encoding techniques: using a look-back period, or Group of Pictures (GOP) are used to achieve more efficient compression. The GOP might be 1, ,2 or 4 seconds long.</p>  <p>Client-side buffering is used to give a smoother streaming experience, even if there are small network issues. This means the user might be watching the stream a few seconds behind the real-time live point.</p>  <p>There are trade-offs between latency, smooth playbac,k and infrastructure demands. Reducing the segment duration increases calls to the CDN, impacting infrastructure needs.</p>  <p>Adaptive bitrate streaming is used to adjust the video quality in response to the user's network conditions.</p>  <p>The client-side player measures the download speed and chooses an appropriate video quality level, matching the user's network capacity.</p>  <p>If the network speed slows down, the client can switch to a lower-quality video (e.g., from 720p to 240p).</p>  <p>The server can also degrade the user's stream by limiting the number of available video quality options, for example during very high load. The server can also adjust the segment length in response to system load.</p>    <p>The client player is always starting playback a few seconds behind the live point, to avoid any interruption in playback if a segment is missed.</p>  <p>If a segment is missed on a TV, the TV will continue playing at the live point. However, on the internet, the client is using a buffer and will try to avoid missing a segment.</p>   Monitoring, Metrics, and Scaling   <p>Monitoring is based on leading and trailing indicators.</p>  <p>Leading indicators help to identify potential problems in realtime. Examples include buffer time and playback failure rates. These leading indicator metrics are given priority in the system.</p>  <p>Trailing indicators are used to perform a detailed analysis of issues after they occur.</p>  <p>Client-side metrics are collected and quickly processed by the server in less than a minute or sometimes within 30 seconds.</p>  <p>Server-side metrics, such as bandwidth, the number of requests, and latency, are also tracked.</p>  <p>The frequency of data collection is adjusted based on the system load. When there is higher traffic, the amount of data collected is sampled to manage the volume of data collected and processed.</p>    <p>Capacity planning is a very complex process involving infrastructure, network, and power, and is started at the end of the prior year, for the next year.</p>  <p>Capacity planning involves coordination with several infra providers to make sure they can scale their infrastructure for the events.</p>  <p>The planning focuses on metrics such as compute, RAM, disk, and network usage. The main metric that becomes the limiting factor is vCPUs.</p>    <p>Cloud resources are not infinite at the scale required for major live events. There is a finite amount of resources in a given location – at this scale of streaming, that is!</p>  <p>Providers need to purchase real estate, install links, and deploy servers.</p>  <p>Horizontal scaling is preferred for compute resources as it is easy to add boxes to the pool.</p>  <p>Databases and caches are scaled preemptively to avoid the need to scale them on the fly during events.</p>    <p>Auto-scaling is not effective for live events because it is too slow to respond to the rapid changes in traffic. Custom scaling systems are preferred.</p>  <p>The custom scaling system uses a concurrency metric, that is the number of users watching the stream, to scale services. All systems are scaled against a common concurrency metric.</p>  <p>The custom scaler also looks at user journeys, such as when users press the back button and return to the home page. This can cause a spike in traffic to the home page API.</p>     APAC-specific live streaming challenges   <p>Mobility is a significant challenge because most users in India watch live streams on mobile devices and are often on the move. This means that users are constantly switching between cell towers.</p>  <p>Battery consumption is also a key factor. Video streaming can quickly drain mobile phone batteries.</p>  <p>The video profile, polling frequency, and encoding algorithms are often chosen to reduce battery consumption.</p>    <p>“Game day simulation”: something Jio did to simulate peak load conditions.</p>  <p>Involved in generating synthetic traffic and the teams needed to scale systems and follow operational protocols in response.</p>  <p>The teams did not have access to the traffic dashboard, so the traffic patterns were unknown to the teams.</p>     Advice for engineers to become better architects   <p>Understand this: anything that can fail, will fail. Overconfidence in systems can lead to problems! Most people underestimate or overlook the potential failure modes.</p>  <p>Look at every aspect of your system including configurations and code as even the smallest things can cause problems.</p>    <p>Detailed metrics and measurements are vital. Both to see potential problems and to be able to debug effectively.</p>  <p>Ensure you are measuring metrics correctly. For example, response time should be measured from when the request is queued, not when it enters the processing function.</p>    <p>Do not rely too heavily on APMs. It is better to understand the low-level details and measure and fine-tune every aspect of your code.</p>  <p>To learn more about video encoding: look up documentation on GitHub and online. Look for resources going into how image compression is done, and how images are turned into video.</p>  <p>Most of the learning happens on the job. There isn't a lot of public information about problems at this kind of scale!

Important, but of secondary importance to the business. But as computer systems come to intermediate almost every interaction the business has with employees, contractors, partners, and customers, dynamic authorization should be seen as a strategic business enabler. Investing in a robust, flexible, and pervasive authorization infrastructure can drive revenue growth, operational efficiency, regulatory compliance, and competitive differentiation.</p> Reducing Operational Costs <p>Manually managing access using rigid, static authorization models like ACLs and groups is labor-intensive and prone to errors. Organizations that rely on static methods often have employees who are dedicated to managing permissions for employees and others. These employees also perform manual audits, track down problems, and manage groups. As the organization grows, these processes become more complex—scaling superlinearly due to interactions in the system.</p><p>Dynamic authorization automates many of these access control decisions, reducing the need for manual intervention. This has several benefits:</p>  <p>Lower administrative overhead—eliminating the need for manually managing permissions and groups reduces administrative costs.</p>  <p>Reduced risk of over-permissioning—accounts with permissions they no longer need are the source of many costly security breaches.</p>  <p>Reduced security insurance premiums—many organizations buy costly insurance for security breaches and ransomware. Better authorization practices and systems can reduce premiums.</p>  <p>Fewer support tickets for access problems—tickets that require IT to drop what they’re doing to sort out a permissioning problem take these critical employees away from work that advances the organization’s products and services.</p>  <p>Improved onboarding and offboarding efficiency—dynamic authorization can ensure new employees or contractors have all the access they need on day one and lose it as soon as they leave.</p>  <p>Improved operational efficiency gives the organization the freedom to explore and grow instead of constantly battling access management problems.</p> Enabling Business Agility and Innovation <p>As more and more business is conducted online, organizations are finding that it’s vital to quickly react to changing business needs. Whether an organization is launching a new product, expanding into new markets, reacting to new regulatory requirements, or enabling new partnerships, being able to flexibly adapt to emerging requirements and support innovation is table stakes for successful organizations.</p><p>As we’ve discussed, static authorization methods require manual changes to lists and groups to increase or decrease access to systems. For example, a financial services firm that is employing external auditors for compliance reviews must grant access for the duration of the engagement. A dynamic authorization system makes this as easy as a policy change. Even that might not be required if authorization policies have been written so as to anticipate this kind of need.</p><p>New products often require custom code to support authorization requirements for customers and administrators. A workforce management service provider launching a new employee onboarding product must ensure that customers can properly authorize varying access levels for their employees to administer and manage the service securely. A dynamic authorization system can be integrated with the new product, allowing developers to build in the right authorization controls without writing custom authorization code.</p> Improving Customer Experience <p>The compelling features of modern SaaS applications, marketplaces, and collaborative services depend on carefully controlling access. In these platforms, dynamic authorization isn’t just for security; it also enhances the user experience and provides enhanced revenue opportunities.</p><p>For example, platforms like Google Docs, Dropbox, and SmugMug all allow their customers to share content with specific people or groups. Dynamic authorization makes this functionality possible.</p><p>Or consider multi-tenant SaaS companies like Workday or Salesforce. Fine-grained authorization allows these companies to isolate customer data while simultaneously allowing granular access within each tenant that follows complex rules. These companies can’t build a single access management system because each tenant requires different access controls depending on their organization, regulatory environment, and internal access policies. Dynamic authorization lets them more easily meet customer needs.</p><p>Finally, many online businesses offer different features to different users depending on subscription levels. Dynamic authorization policies allow this to be done without custom code and give the business flexibility to add or modify subscription levels and features without changing the underlying code.</p> Strengthening Security and Compliance <p>Using dynamic authorization for improved security and regulatory compliance provides several business advantages. Industries like finance, healthcare, and government are heavily regulated. The regulations require organizations to enforce least privilege access, ensure auditability, and dynamically adjust access based on employee roles and changing risk conditions. Organizational benefits from using dynamic authorization include decreased compliance risk, better employee experience, fewer workarounds that introduce security problems, and reduced overall cost.</p> Competitive Differentiation <p>Using dynamic authorization inside products gives organizations a competitive edge by offering a more secure, flexible, and user-friendly product.</p><p>For example, a B2B SaaS company with a product built with fine-grained access control can better attract large enterprise customers who demand flexible, yet secure features. A financial services company that lets customers dynamically set transaction limits based on varying risk signals allows them to reduce fraud while maintaining a rich user experience. A collaboration tool that offers flexible, secure content sharing beats out competitors who use more rigid, static sharing models.</p><p>Organizations can more easily respond to competitor product changes when access management is as simple as a policy change. And dynamic authorization provides these benefits without developers having to write custom code.</p> A Business Necessity <p>The preceding sections offer multiple examples of how dynamic authorization goes well beyond enhanced IT security. Organizations that embrace dynamic authorization gain enhanced operational efficiency through automation, increased business agility to more easily pursue new opportunities, stronger security and compliance with less overhead, and better customer experiences that drive customer engagement and revenue.</p><p>In the era of multi-tenant, AI-enhanced, SaaS applications, dynamic authorization is essential for organizations to securely scale and effectively compete. Failing to adopt better access management technologies and mechanisms puts organizations at risk of losing their competitive advantage.</p>   <p>Photo Credit: <a>Octopus busy approving things</a> from DALL-E (public domain) Prompt: Draw a picture of an octopus wearing an officials hat with each arm holding stamps that say either "allow" or "deny".

<p>Bitcoin failed.  J.P. Koning notes in <a href="https://jpkoning.blogspot.com/2025/02/the-end-of-el-salvadors-bitcoin.html">The end of El Salvador’s bitcoin payments experiment</a>:</p>

  <code>But here was a government that was going to champion the stuff, nullifying all of the headwinds against bitcoin in one stroke! The government meddling hypothesis would be put to test.

The Salvadoran government used a combination of sticks and carrots to kick-start adoption. First, let's list the carrots. The capital gains tax on bitcoin was set to zero to remove the hassle of buying stuff with bitcoin. The government also built a bitcoin payments app, Chivo, for all El Salvadoreans to use. (Chivo also supports U.S. dollar payments.) Anyone who downloaded Chivo and transacted with bitcoin would receive a $30 bitcoin bonus—that's a lot of money in El Salvador. Gas stations offered $0.20 off of a gallon of gas for customers who paid with the app. People could also use Chivo to pay their taxes with bitcoin.

The biggest carrot was zero-transaction fees. Any payment conducted with Chivo was free, as was converting bitcoins held in the Chivo app into U.S. dollars and withdrawing cash at Chivo ATMs. These Chivo ATMs were rolled out across El Salvador and in the U.S., too, to encourage the nascent U.S.-to-El Salvador bitcoin remittance route. Bitcoin ATMs are usually incredibly pricey to use, but in El Salvador the government would eat all the transaction fees. What a fantastic deal.

As for the stick, Bukele introduced a forced-tender rule. Beginning in 2021, businesses were required to accept the orange coin or be punished. This was costly for them to comply with. They would have to update point of sale software, signage, train employees, and set up new processes for handling bitcoins post-sale.

By all rights, this combination of sticks and carrots should have led to a flourishing of bitcoin payments. But it didn't.
</code> 
 

<p>Koning concludes:</p>

  <code>The saddest thing about El Salvador's bitcoin experiment is that all sorts of time and resources have been wasted. El Salvador is not a rich country. The money spent on building and operating Chivo, compliance by businesses, bitcoin signage, and subsidies could have been better deployed on more important things like health and education.  One hopes that other countries learn from this experience and avoid going down the same route that El Salvador did.

<p>A few years ago, companies like Google, Microsoft and Facebook were known as places where – inside certain organizations – some engineers could earn large sums of money for doing comparatively little work, and wile away the work week waiting for their large new joiner equity to vest over four years. This chill approach is what the “rest” in rest-and-vest refers to, which was a popular phrase at the time for it. These places also had many teams where work was laid back, and it was possible to “coast” and get by doing relatively little.</p><p>In 2017, Business Insider interviewed several such folks and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.nl/rest-and-vest-millionaire-engineers-who-barely-work-silicon-valley-2017-7">wrote</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“Business Insider talked to about a half a dozen people with direct knowledge of the rest-and-vest culture. Some were "fat cats" themselves. Some were hiring managers who tried to lure these folks back to the world of productivity. Many acknowledged that resting and vesting was a common, hush-hush practice at their own companies. Internally, these people are often referred to as "coasters."</p><p>Their lives counter the other reality for many in the tech world: long work hours and pressure for workers to pledge unrelenting devotion to their companies and jobs above all else.”</p></blockquote><p>A culture of lenient performance management at the biggest tech businesses contributed to laidback work patterns; I talked with managers at the likes of Google and Microsoft at the time who were frustrated that the system made it hard to manage out folks who were visibly checked out, and were hard to motivate to do even the bare minimum work.</p><p>Fast forward to today, and there are signs that Big Tech employers are being tougher than ever in performance management, and any tolerance of “rest and vest” culture is history. This article covers:</p>  <p>Meta: first performance-based mass layoffs. Nearly 3,700 people have been dismissed as ‘low performers’; it’s the first time that another reason wasn’t given for layoffs by the social media giant.</p>  <p>Microsoft: performance-based firings are back. Employees terminated on the spot for performance reasons, without warning, and some don’t get severance.</p>  <p>Evolution of Microsoft’s performance management. The Windows maker has been brutal in performance management before: its old stack ranking system was unpopular for close to two decades.</p>  <p>Even without stack ranking, there’s still bucketing. Stack ranking fell out of favor years ago, but bucketing is still how performance reviews work.</p>  <p>Why now? The end of zero rates, a cooling job market, and more. Takeaways from recent mass layoffs.</p>  <p>Companies that always had high performance expectations. Some Big Tech businesses have always had strict performance standards. For example, within Amazon, Netflix, and NVIDIA, little will change.</p>  <p>Related to this article is our two-part deepdive into <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/performance-calibrations">How performance calibrations are done at tech companies</a>.</p> 1. Meta: first performance-based mass layoffs <p>Meta did no mass layoffs for its first 18 years of its existence, until November 2022 when it <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-scoop-32">let go 13% of staff</a>. Back then, there were business reasons. I <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-scoop-32">wrote at the time</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Meta’s revenue is simply not growing fast enough. In Meta’s Historic Growth Challenge, I suggested that just by allowing attrition to slightly reduce headcount expenses, Meta could catch up with profitability. However, what I did not account for was how attrition was likely too slow to wait for, and not fully within the company’s control. Layoffs, however, are.</p><p>The stock price pressure likely became too much. Meta’s stock price dipped under $100 for the first time on Thursday, 27 October, a week before layoffs. The stock dropped by 26% that day, which was the biggest one-day fall, after the company forecast weaker-than-expected revenue growth for Q4 2022. (...)</p><p>Zuck has summarized these layoffs:</p><p>“We’ve cut costs across our business, including scaling back budgets, reducing perks, and shrinking our real estate footprint. We’re restructuring teams to increase our efficiency. But these measures alone won’t bring our expenses in line with our revenue growth, so I’ve also made the hard decision to let people go.”</p></blockquote><p>Six months later in early 2023, the company <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/108835985/meta-a-second-round-of-layoffs-and-restructuring-to-come">reduced headcount</a> by another 11%, letting go 10,000 people The reasoning was that it had overhired during the pandemic years of 2020-2021, and was too bloated. The layoffs flattened the organization and boosted efficiency.</p><p>That was two years ago, and since then Meta has become more efficient: it generates more revenue ($164B per year) and profit ($62B) than ever before, and its value is at an all-time high of $1.8 trillion dollars.</p><p>It’s in this context that Meta announces its first-ever performance-based mass layoffs. Five percent of staff are expected to be let go, starting this week with around 3,700 people. An internal email from Mark Zuckerberg explains why, as reported <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/14/meta-targeting-lowest-performing-employees-in-latest-round-of-layoffs.html">by CNBC</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“I’ve decided to raise the bar on performance management and move out low performers faster. We typically manage out people who aren’t meeting expectations over the course of a year, but now we’re going to do more extensive performance-based cuts during this cycle, with the intention of back filling these roles in 2025.</p><p>We won’t manage out everyone who didn’t meet expectations for the last period if we’re optimistic about their future performance, and for those we do let go, we’ll provide generous severance in line with what we provided with previous cuts.”</p></blockquote><p>This clarity that it’s “low performers” who are being laid off, is new. The large mass layoffs of 2022-23 were justified differently. Of course, low performers are at risk of being let go in most circumstances. However, in Meta’s previous layoffs, plenty of high-performers were also cut who worked in teams seen as bloated <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/profit-centers-cost-centers">cost centers</a>, or targeted for sharp headcount drops.</p><p>While these cuts are unfortunate, Meta at least is <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/tech/meta-begins-performance-based-layoffs-143643090.html">offering</a> generous severance to those impacted: 16 weeks of pay and an additional two weeks for each year of service.</p> 2. Microsoft: performance-based firings are back <p>Meta isn’t the only tech giant terminating employees based on performance concerns; Microsoft is doing the same  — except on an individual basis. Also <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-performance-based-job-cuts-have-started-termination-letters-2025-1">from Business Insider</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“Microsoft has started performance-based job cuts, according to termination letters viewed by Business Insider.<br><br>Microsoft is taking a stronger stance on performance management like its competitors, and managers at the company have spent the past few months evaluating employees all the way up to level 80, one of its highest levels.”</p></blockquote><p>One of several termination letters was reported by Business Insider. It reads:</p><blockquote><p>"The reason(s) for the termination of your employment include that your job performance has not met minimum performance standards and expectations for your position… You are relieved of all job duties effective immediately and your access to Microsoft systems, accounts, and buildings will be removed effective today. You are not to perform any further work on behalf of Microsoft."</p></blockquote><p>Just to repeat, performance-related firing is commonplace, but what’s different here is how short and quick the process is. Previously, most of Big Tech followed a standard process for workers seen as in need of improvement:</p>  <p>Feedback from the manager, often at a biannual performance review</p>  <p>Performance improvement plan (PIP) which formalises why someone is not meeting performance expectations, and how to succeed with the plan</p>  <p>Dismissal upon failure to clear the PIP. Big Tech has been known for generous severance packages which exceed the legal minimum</p>  <p>But now, Microsoft seems to be skipping PIPs and also not offering severance in some cases. This is unusual, given how differently the tech giant had treated employees since Satya Nadella became CEO. It also feels unusually petty to cancel severance packages for those affected, especially as Microsoft is reporting record profits. Is it a message to low performers to expect nothing from the company?</p><p>Microsoft getting “cutthroat” in its performance-management is also out of character, as it was Nadella who introduced a more lenient performance management approach, back in 2014.</p> 3. Evolution of Microsoft’s performance management <p>Between the 1990s and 2013, Microsoft used a stack ranking system for performance management, which wasn’t advertised to employees until the mid-2000s – although many knew about Microsoft’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitality_curve">“vitality curve”</a> for ranking engineers and managers. Under this, workers high on the curve got outsized bonuses and pay rises, and those low down the curve; well, they got managed out.</p><p>In 2004, Mini Microsoft (an anonymous employee at the company, blogging in the public) wrote a post <a href="https://minimsft.blogspot.com/2004/07/microsoft-stack-rank-as-popularity.html">explaining</a> how the then still-secretive stack ranking worked:</p><blockquote><p>“Then along came a new lead. Her feedback [to me was], "You've got to increase your team visibility so that you can do better in the stack rank meeting."</p><p>The what-rank? She said it slower as if it would help me to divine what the heck she was talking about. Then she got up and gave me the stack rank lesson and I got to learn about how the team is divided into columns of high, medium, and low folks and then each column has a person by person relative ranking, all those positions negotiated by the leads putting their people up on the whiteboard and then arguing the merits of which report belongs above which other reports.</p><p>She said they set the context of their decisions by asking a question like, "Okay, if the team were on a sinking boat and we had to decide who we would put on the life-boats, who would it be?" Up to that point, my ass was next in line for the boat but still going down with the ship.”</p></blockquote><p>From 2004 – mostly thanks to this blog post – stack ranking was no longer a secret, but it wasn’t until 2011 that then-CEO Stever Ballmer acknowledged its existence in an internal email, <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/microsoftpri0/2014835496_microsoft_employees_will_get_pay_raises.html">writing</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“Each rating at each level will now have set compensation tied to the rating.</p><p>These ratings will be based on the results you accomplished during the review period (assessed against your commitments), how you accomplished them, and your proven capability. Ratings will be a simple 1-5 system with relative performance being assessed across common peer groups.”</p></blockquote><p>The buckets were pre-defined, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitality_curve">supposedly</a> as 20% (top performers), 20% (good performers), 40% (average), 13% (below average), and 7% (poor performers).</p><p>I worked at Microsoft starting in 2012, the year after the existence of the stack ranking system became public knowledge. Knowing the distribution made me hope for a grade of 1-2, which would have meant my manager saw me as the “top 40%” within the team. I ended up getting a “3” in 2013, which I was disappointed with, as I interpreted it as being in the bottom 20th to 60th percentile.</p><p>Later, I talked with a HR person, who told me that nobody at Microsoft was ever happy with their grades:</p>  <p>Those getting a “1” (the highest rating for the top 20%) think they deserve it. Many feel entitled to it, more than they’re happy to achieve it</p>  <p>Everyone on a 2 to a 5 is disappointed to different extents</p>  <p>Stever Ballmer’s departure spelt the end of the stack ranking system. Shortly after Ballmer announced his retirement in August 2013, the company <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303460004579193951987616572">announced</a> the system was also being retired, effective immediately in November 2013. There are a few possible reasons why Stack Ranking went extinct:</p><p>1. Office politics ruled Microsoft. From the mid-2000s, it was increasingly clear that internal politics was more important than building products customers loved.</p><p>Microsoft was blindsided by the 2007 launch of the iPhone, and the launch of Android the next year. It took three more years to finally launch a competitive device – the Windows Phone in 2011. By then, iPhone and Android had captured the bulk of the smartphone market.</p><p>In 2011, Google software engineer and cartoonist Manu Cornet drew <a href="https://goomics.net/62">a cartoon</a> about how he perceived Amazon, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, and Oracle. This was what how he represented the Xbox maker:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbfc216f8-4425-4f9f-9fea-af7b9c0b0be3_666x436.png">          </a>Source: <a href="https://goomics.net/62">Manu Cornet</a> <p>This image went viral, even though Manu never intended it as a big joke in his comic strip, as he explains in <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/manu">The Man Behind the Tech Comics</a>. The intended target of the joke was Oracle, but his image of Microsoft captured a widely perceived truth.</p><p>Back then, there was close to zero collaboration between divisions at Microsoft, which were thousands of employees in size; like Windows Office, Server, Xbox, and Skype. I experienced the lack of collaboration – to the point of hostility – first-hand. In late 2013, my team was building Skype for Web, which we positioned as a competitor to Google Hangouts. We had a problem, though: in order to start a video or voice call, users needed to download a plugin which contained the required video codecs. We noticed Google Hangouts did the same on Internet Explorer and Firefox, but not on Chrome because the plugin was bundled with the browser for a frictionless experience.</p><p>My team decided we had to offer the same frictionless experience on Microsoft’s latest browser, Edge, which was in development at the time. After weeks of back-and-forth, the team politely and firmly rejected bundling our plugin into the new Microsoft browser. The reason? Their KPI was to minimize the download size of the browser, and helping us would not help them reach that goal.</p><p>It was a maddening experience. Microsoft could not compete with the likes of Google due to internal dysfunction like this; with teams and individuals focused on their own targets at the expense of the greater good for the company and users.</p><p>2. Stack ranking pinpointed as the core of the problem. In 2012, Vanity Fair published <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/business/2012/08/microsoft-lost-mojo-steve-ballmer">Microsoft’s lost decade</a>, which said:</p><blockquote><p>“At the center of the cultural problems was a management system called “stack ranking.” Every current and former Microsoft employee I interviewed—every one—cited stack ranking as the most destructive process inside of Microsoft, something that drove out untold numbers of employees. (...)</p><p>The system—also referred to as “the performance model,” “the bell curve,” or just “the employee review”—has, with certain variations over the years, worked like this: every unit was forced to declare a certain percentage of employees as top performers, then good performers, then average, then below average, then poor.</p><p>In the end, the stack-ranking system crippled the ability to innovate at Microsoft, executives said. “I wanted to build a team of people who would work together and whose only focus would be on making great software,” said Bill Hill, the former manager. “But you can’t do that at Microsoft.”</p></blockquote><p>3. Investor and board pressure. By 2013, Microsoft’s stock had been flat for about 12 years. It was clear that cultural change was needed to turn business performance around, and removing the hated stack ranking system was one of the easiest ways for the leadership team to show that change was afoot.</p><p>4. Ballmer’s exit. Several leaders including Head of HR Lisa Brummel were never in favor of stack ranking, as Business Insider <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-just-killed-its-controversial-stack-ranking-employee-review-system-2013-11?">reported</a> at the time. With Ballmer gone, executives could push decisions that would’ve previously been vetoed, before a new CEO took the helm.</p><p>Satya Nadella replaced stack ranking with a more collaborative performance review system. As CEO, he recognized the cultural problems Microsoft had. In his 2017 book, Hit Refresh, he recalled the pre-2014 times:</p><blockquote><p>"Innovation was being replaced by bureaucracy. Teamwork was being replaced by internal politics. We were falling behind."</p></blockquote><p>A new performance review system attempted to address the problems, rating employees in three areas:</p>  <p>Individual impact</p>  <p>Contributing to others’ success</p>  <p>Leveraging the work of others</p>  <p>Microsoft also got rid of its vitality curve (the stack ranking system), starting from 2014. The changes resulted in a different performance review process, where individual impact carried less weight. In 2022, Microsoft even <a href="https://hbr.org/2022/06/why-microsoft-measures-employee-thriving-not-engagement">started to measure</a> how many of its employees said they were “thriving”, which it defined as being “energized and empowered to do meaningful work.” Note that this was at the peak of the <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/perfect-storm-causing-a-hot-tech-hiring-market">hottest job market in tech</a>, when attrition spiked across the sector, and even Big Tech needed new ways to retain people.</p><p>Signs that performance management was changing again were visible in 2023, when last September, Microsoft <a href="https://www.hrkatha.com/global-hr-news/microsoft-introduces-secret-performance-rating-system-for-managers/">quietly introduced</a> a new field for managers called “impact designators.” They had to rate the impact of their reports and not disclose this to employees. The ratings determined bonuses and pay rises.</p><p>As a former engineering manager, what surprised me about this lowkey change was not that it happened, but rather that it raises the question of what Microsoft was doing before? “Impact designator” is another name for “multiplier”, used in most tech workplaces. Ahead of performance calibration meetings, managers often know this information and must fit the budget, or can sometimes exceed it. Multipliers are finalized in the calibration which helps for dividing bonus pots, equity refresh, and pay rise budgets.</p><p>So it was a surprise to learn Microsoft operated without managers setting or recommending multipliers for nine years, as part of the performance process.</p> 4. Even without stack ranking, there’s still bucketing <p>The demise of divisive stack ranking was cheered; but in reality, all larger companies still operate ranking frameworks today. At most mid-sized-and-above companies, performance review processes have the explicit goal to identify and reward top performers, and to find low performers and figure out what to do next. We cover the dynamics of the process in a two-part deepdive. <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/performance-calibrations">Performance calibrations at tech companies</a>, including:</p>

The API exchanges the Microsoft Entra ID access token for a new Duende IdentityServer access token using the OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange standard. Both APIs use a user delegated access token. The tokens are persisted on the trusted backend using the IDistributedCache implementation. This can be an in-memory cache or a persistent cache. When using this cache, it is important to automatically renew the access token, if it is missing or invalid.</p>







<p></p>



 What must an application manage? 



<p>An access token management solution must ensure that tokens are securely stored per user session for delegated downstream API user tokens and updated after each UI authentication or refresh. The solution should be robust to handle token expiration, function seamlessly after restarts, and support multi-instance deployments. The tokens must be persisted safely in multiple instance setups. Additionally, it must effectively manage scenarios involving invalid or missing access tokens.</p>



 Properties of token management in the solution setup: 



 
 The access token is persisted per user session 



 The token expires 



 The token needs to be persisted somewhere safely (Safe and encrypted storage if not in-memory) 



 The token must be replaced after each UI authentication (per user) 



 The solution must work after restarts 



 The solution must work for multiple instances when deployed to multi-instance deployments. 



 The solution must handle invalid access tokens or missing access tokens 



 The application must handle a user logout 
 



 Client Implementation (Entra ID API) 



<p>An OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange token request is sent to the Duende IdentityServer using the ApiTokenCacheClient. The service persists the token in a cache per user. The cache is implemented using the IDistributedCache interface.</p>

 Duende IdentityServer implementation 



<p>Duende IdentityServer provides an IExtensionGrantValidator interface to implement the identity server support for OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange standard. This service must validate the access token and provide the data to issue a new Duende access token. Other validation checks are required like validating the sub claim which represents the user in the delegated access token. It is important to validate the access token fully. The new access tokens should only be issued for the same user. It is important to use a unique identifier from the access token to read data and issue new data for the user. An email is normally not a good solution for this as users can change their email in some IAM solutions.</p>

<p></p>



<p>In Duende a client is required to support the OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange. This is added using the AllowedGrantTypes property. A secret is also required to acquire a new access token.</p>


  new Client
{
    ClientId = "tokenexchangeclientid",
    ClientSecrets = { new Secret("--in-user-secrets--".Sha256()) },

    AllowedGrantTypes = { OidcConstants.GrantTypes.TokenExchange },
    AllowedScopes = { "shopclientscope" }
}
  


<p></p>



<p>Support for the OAuth Token Exchange is added to the Duende IdentityServer setup using the AddExtensionGrantValidator extension method.</p>


  var idsvrBuilder = builder.Services
    .AddIdentityServer(options =&gt;
    {
        options.Events.RaiseErrorEvents = true;
        options.Events.RaiseInformationEvents = true;
        options.Events.RaiseFailureEvents = true;
        options.Events.RaiseSuccessEvents = true;

        // see https://docs.duendesoftware.com/identityserver/v6/fundamentals/resources/
        options.EmitStaticAudienceClaim = true;
    })
    .AddInMemoryIdentityResources(Config.IdentityResources)
    .AddInMemoryApiScopes(Config.ApiScopes)
    .AddInMemoryClients(Config.Clients())
    .AddAspNetIdentity&lt;ApplicationUser&gt;();

// registers extension grant validator for the token exchange grant type
idsvrBuilder.AddExtensionGrantValidator&lt;TokenExchangeGrantValidator&gt;();
  


<p></p>



 Running the solutions 



<p>When all four applications are started, the data from the Duende protected API is returned to the Razor Page application which uses Microsoft Entra ID to authenticate.</p>

<p>I made a video today reflecting on how we manage (or don’t) our energy and how our engagement with digital information complicates our lives. I’m proposing that people consider dialing back their social media consumption to spend time reflecting on their thinking, what we have learned over the past five years, and how we can navigate future challenges with integrity and grace. In the space that is created I am hoping some people will experience ontopoetic synchronicities, conversations with the divine, as we become more intentional about how we direct our consciousness and bodies in this 3D world. I would love to hear back from anyone who gives this a try to see what your experience has been. Life is a stage and we are players.

  Big Tech companies seem to have learned the lesson on how they became dominant in the past. So most of them are giving away AI functionality for free – even if this could be at loss for them.

Notice an interesting event or trend? <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/contact/">Send me a message</a>.</p><p>Today, we cover:</p>  <p>Industry pulse. Where TikTok’s software engineers went, Apple Intelligence half-baked at launch, former FTC chair Lina Khan warns of reduced competition, OpenAI launches autonomous browser agent, Apple drops its AR glasses, with Meta also facing struggles – and more</p>  <p>Big Tech using distribution to win at AI? Meta, Microsoft, and Google are using their distribution power and financial muscle to give away AI features for free to users and customers. It’s a sensible way to avoid disruption, which makes it much harder for startups to compete</p>  <p>Before we start: thank you for all the thoughtful comments on last week’s issue about <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-pulse-122-deepseek-rocks-the">DeepSeek rocking the tech industry</a>. I corrected a few details based on feedback – most notably how DeepSeek’s cost efficiency seems to be closer to 4-5x that of OpenAI, not 10-40x. See the <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-pulse-122-deepseek-rocks-the">updated issue here</a>.</p> 1. Industry Pulse  Where did TikTok’s software engineers go? <p>The past six months has been something of a Doomsday scenario-esque countdown for TikTok, as the start date of its ban in the US crept ever closer. In the event, TikTok <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/155552919/tiktoks-gamble-pays-off">did indeed go offline</a> for a few hours on 19 January, before President Trump gave the social network a stay of execution lasting 75 days.</p><p>How has this uncertainty affected software engineers at the Chinese-owned social network? According to data shared exclusively with The Pragmatic Engineer by <a href="https://www.livedatatechnologies.com/">Live Data Technologies</a>, which tracks real-time live job change data across more than 160M professionals, this is how:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F24c123a7-a4bd-4c3b-83c2-9e4048a27df3_1434x1600.png">          </a>Where engineers went after TikTok, and where they joined from. Source: <a href="https://www.livedatatechnologies.com/">Live Data Technologies</a> <p>There’s been an outflow of engineers to:</p>  <p>Big Tech: Meta, Google, Amazon (and AWS), Microsoft and Apple.</p>  <p>Publicly traded tech companies: Snap, Pinterest, Snowflake, DoorDash, NVIDIA, Coinbase, Coupang, Salesforce, Uber</p>  <p>Few private companies: X (formerly: Twitter) and OpenAI</p>  <p>It seems the uncertainty has motivated TikTok engineers to interview and quit when they get an offer. Still, I find it surprising that hardly any scaleups are popular destinations among TikTok leavers. To me, it indicates that people quit for better liquid total compensation packages; which may be why publicly traded companies are the most popular destination.</p> Apple Intelligence half-baked?

Chip has worked as a researcher at Netflix, was a core developer at NVIDIA (building NeMo, NVIDIA’s GenAI framework), and co-founded Claypot AI. She also taught Machine Learning at Stanford University.</p><p>In this conversation, we dive into the evolving field of AI Engineering and explore key insights from Chip’s book, including:</p><p>• How AI Engineering differs from Machine Learning Engineering</p><p>• Why fine-tuning is usually not a tactic you’ll want (or need) to use</p><p>• The spectrum of solutions to customer support problems – some not even involving AI!</p><p>• The challenges of LLM evals (evaluations)</p><p>• Why project-based learning is valuable—but even better when paired with structured learning</p><p>• Exciting potential use cases for AI in education and entertainment</p><p>• And more!</p>     Takeaways <p>My biggest takeaways from this episode:</p><p>1. “AI engineering” feels closer to software engineering than to ML engineering. The term itself is very new, and “AI engineering” evolved from ML engineering. A big difference is that thanks to LLMs being easy to use (both via APIs, and locally) “AI engineering” is much more about building a product first – and later on, getting around to tweaking the model itself. ML engineering was the other way around: spend a lot of time building a model, and then build an application on it.</p><p>2. To get good at AI engineering, focus on the basics. Understand what an LLM is (and how it works), how to evaluate them, how to use RAG, what finetuning is, and how to optimize inference. All of these techniques are foundational, and will remain important in a few years’ time as well. Chip’s book <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-engineering/9781098166298/">AI Engineering</a> covers all these topics.</p><p>3. “The more we want to not miss out on things, the more things we will miss.” When I asked Chip about what she thinks about the fear of missing out (FOMO) across AI: she said it’s ironic that when you are worried about missing out, and keep up with everything new – you stay shallow! Chip doesn’t read news: she chooses to focus on deep research or learning instead. If there’s something that is important today: it will be important next week, after she’s done finishing learning whatever she was focused on.</p><p>4. Solving the problem is more important than using the latest AI tools. Amusingly, a lot of teams miss this part: and they build overcompliacated AI solutions that do practically nothing for the business.</p><p>Before the interview, I’ve started to go through Chip’s newly published book: <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-engineering/9781098166298/">AI Engineering</a>. It feels to me this book will become a desk reference, and I recommend it.</p> The Pragmatic Engineer deepdives relevant for this episode <p>• <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/rag">Applied AI Software Engineering: RAG</a></p><p>• <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/ai-coding-agents">How do AI software engineering agents work?</a></p><p>• <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/ai-tooling-2024">AI Tooling for Software Engineers in 2024: Reality Check</a></p><p>• <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/ide-that-software-engineers-love">IDEs with GenAI features that Software Engineers love</a></p> Timestamps <p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98o_L3jlixw&amp;t=0s">00:00</a>) Intro</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98o_L3jlixw&amp;t=91s">01:31</a>) A quick overview of AI Engineering</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98o_L3jlixw&amp;t=405s">06:45</a>) How Chip ensured her book stays current amidst the rapid advancements in AI</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98o_L3jlixw&amp;t=695s">11:35</a>) A definition of AI Engineering and how it differs from Machine Learning Engineering</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98o_L3jlixw&amp;t=1095s">18:15</a>) Simple first steps in building AI applications</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98o_L3jlixw&amp;t=1478s">24:38</a>) An explanation of BM25 (retrieval system)</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98o_L3jlixw&amp;t=1528s">25:28</a>) The problems associated with fine-tuning</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98o_L3jlixw&amp;t=1780s">29:40</a>) Simple customer support solutions for rolling out AI thoughtfully</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98o_L3jlixw&amp;t=2129s">35:29</a>) Chip’s thoughts on staying focused on the problem</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98o_L3jlixw&amp;t=2224s">37:04</a>) The challenge in evaluating AI systems</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98o_L3jlixw&amp;t=2403s">40:03</a>) Use cases in evaluating AI</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98o_L3jlixw&amp;t=2589s">43:09</a>) The importance of prioritizing users’ needs and experience</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98o_L3jlixw&amp;t=2889s">48:09</a>) Common mistakes made with Gen AI</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98o_L3jlixw&amp;t=3237s">53:57</a>) A case for systematic problem solving</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98o_L3jlixw&amp;t=3297s">54:57</a>) Project-based learning vs. structured learning</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98o_L3jlixw&amp;t=3607s">1:00:07</a>) Why AI is not the end of engineering</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98o_L3jlixw&amp;t=3896s">1:04:56</a>) How AI is helping education and the future use cases we might see</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98o_L3jlixw&amp;t=4138s">1:08:58</a>) Rapid fire round</p> A summary of the conversation  What is AI engineering?   <p>AI engineering is a shift from machine learning to more engineering and product-focused work.</p>  <p>Previously, building machine learning applications required creating custom models, necessitating data and expertise in model training. Now, AI models can be used simply by making API calls. This lowers the barrier to entry and eliminates the need for specialized ML/AI degrees or to have large amounts of data collected.</p>  <p>Machine learning engineers did a lot of preparation work. They traditionally focused on data collection, annotation, and model training before deployment. AI engineering, in contrast, starts with a product idea and then progresses to data gathering and working with models.</p>  <p>AI Engineering is a new term. It emerged because the role is different from traditional Machine Learning Engineering. Chip surveyed people building applications on top of foundation models, and 'AI Engineering' was the most common way to describe what they did – so she stuck with this name!</p>  <p>A key difference compared to ML engineering: AI engineers often begin with readily available APIs or pre-trained models. This means they can start to prototype and iterate early on. They will only consider building custom models much, much later! See how e.g. Perplexity <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/perplexity-and-kagi">started to build their own AI models</a> after their product was launched as the first version.</p>   Ways to build AI applications   <p>Start with basics. Understand what a “good response” and a “bad response” means. To do so, you need to set guidelines and evaluate responses. Use both automation and manual review.</p>  <p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a commonly used pattern for adding context to model responses. RAG involves retrieving relevant documents or information to augment the model's context. We previously did <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/rag">a deepdive on RAG.</a></p>  <p>Keyword retrieval. Many equate RAG with vector search, but a simpler approach may be more effective initially. Try keyword retrieval before doing vector searches: as vector databases can be costly and may obscure specific keywords.</p>  <p>Data preparation and chunking are important to get right for RAG. Techniques such as extracting metadata or keywords from documents can significantly improve performance, potentially more than focusing on the database itself.</p>    <p>Fine-tuning: often a last resort and many teams never do it. This is due to the complexities of hosting and maintaining a fine-tuned model. The rapid pace of model development also makes it difficult for fine-tuned models to maintain their advantage over time.</p>  <p>One step at a time. Take a structured approach: starting with prompting, adding data, and then move to more complex methods if needed. Understand that the problem being solved is more important than using the latest technology.</p>  <p>Resist the urge to ship only incremental improvements. Building out new use cases is usually far more beneficial.</p>   Practical approaches and avoiding pitfalls   <p>Start with a human in the loop. After that, gradually increase automation as confidence in the AI solution grows. A phased rollout, starting with internal use cases, can help to mitigate risk.</p>  <p>Focus on solving the problem, not just using AI. Apply the simplest solutions to remove roadblocks.</p>  <p>Common mistakes:</p>  <p>Using GenAI when it’s not needed. Some problems may be better solved with simpler solutions like spreadsheets or manually scheduling tasks.</p>  <p>Abandoning GenAI when it doesn’t seem to work, without pinpointing where the process fails. Reasons for GenAI not (yet) working could be in data extraction or text processing. Don’t give up too easily!</p>  <p>Jumping into complex solutions like vector databases or fine-tuning without addressing simpler approaches.</p>    <p>Be careful about using untested or rapidly changing AI frameworks because they can introduce bugs and issues.</p>   Evaluating AI systems   <p>A difficult area, because as AI becomes more sophisticated, it is harder to assess the output. A convincing summary might not be a good summary, and a math solution from AI can be hard to evaluate if one does not know the answer.</p>  <p>There is no single, simple solution to evaluation. Instead, a combination of methods is required and talking to users, analysing their interactions and manual data inspections are essential.</p>  <p>Measure what matters. Sometimes, what seems intuitive isn’t what users actually want, for example, a meeting summarisation tool focusing on action items instead of overall content.</p>  <p>Do not skip the hard and manual work! Manual data inspection is critical and still offers the highest ratio of value</p>  <p>Human evaluations are important for seeing how users are actually using the product and to correlate with automated metrics.</p>   Learning AI Engineering   <p>Two ways of learning:</p>  <p>Project-based learning: pick up a project and working through all the problems.</p>  <p>Structured learning: taking courses or reading books.</p>    <p>Tutorials are great but it's important to stop and ask questions. Without that, tutorials can lead to mindlessly copying code without understanding it.</p>  <p>Combine project-based learning with structured learning. Also, observe your own workflow and see what parts can be automated by AI to get use case ideas.</p>  <p>Coding is not the same as software engineering. Software engineering is about solving problems, and while AI can automate coding, it cannot fully automate the problem-solving process.</p>  <p>AI can enable software engineers to build much more complex software.</p>  <p>AI will not eliminate software engineering because it can only automate part of the software engineering process. The need for precision in software development requires someone who understands the nuances of code.</p>   Resources &amp; Mentions <p>Where to find Chip Huyen:</p><p>• X: <a href="https://x.com/chipro">https://x.com/chipro</a></p><p>• LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chiphuyen/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/chiphuyen/</a></p><p>• Website: <a href="https://huyenchip.com/">https://huyenchip.com/</a></p><p>Mentions during the episode:</p><p>• AI Engineering: Building Applications with Foundation Models: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/AI-Engineering-Building-Applications-Foundation/dp/1098166302/r">https://www.amazon.com/AI-Engineering-Building-Applications-Foundation/dp/1098166302/r</a></p><p>• DeepSeek: <a href="https://www.deepseek.com/">https://www.deepseek.com/</a></p><p>• Multimodality and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs): <a href="https://huyenchip.com/2023/10/10/multimodal.html">https://huyenchip.com/2023/10/10/multimodal.html</a></p><p>• BM25: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25</a></p><p>• Microsoft Bot Framework: <a href="https://dev.botframework.com/">https://dev.botframework.com/</a></p><p>• Python: <a href="https://www.python.org/">https://www.python.org/</a></p><p>• Javascript: <a href="https://www.javascript.com/">https://www.javascript.com/</a></p><p>• ChatGPT: <a href="https://chatgpt.com/">https://chatgpt.com/</a></p><p>• Claude: <a href="https://claude.ai/">https://claude.ai/</a></p><p>• Llama: <a href="https://www.llama.com/">https://www.llama.com/</a></p><p>• Complex Adaptive Systems: An Introduction to Computational Models of Social Life (Princeton Studies in Complexity): <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Complex-Adaptive-Systems-Introduction-Computational/dp/0691127026/">https://www.amazon.com/Complex-Adaptive-Systems-Introduction-Computational/dp/0691127026/</a></p><p>• The Selfish Gene: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Selfish-Gene-Anniversary-Landmark-Science/dp/0198788606/">https://www.amazon.com/Selfish-Gene-Anniversary-Landmark-Science/dp/0198788606/</a></p><p>• Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0812979680/">https://www.amazon.com/dp/0812979680/</a></p><p>—</p><p>Production and marketing by <a href="https://penname.co/">Pen Name</a>.

 The People of DRCongo Shed Light on the “Heart of Darkness” as Our Media Looks the Other Way 
<blockquote>
<p><a href="mailto:soljacksteve@gmail.com">Steve Soloman</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keeping up with world events, important as it is, can nonetheless be fraught. Any Canadian who wishes to stay informed has seen the coverage: autocratic governments flexing their muscles, personality cults rather than responsible governments and the rule of law being threatened even in well-established democracies. The internal rot of misguided populism and hyper partisanship, challenging as they are, are only the first steps along a very rocky road.</p>
<p>Despite what we see and hear, the news is not all bad. There is a place, little noticed and even less understood by most Canadians, where democracy is growing stronger despite a history of violence and exploitation.</p>
<p>When we think of Africa - if we think of it at all - we picture a continent struggling to overcome its colonial past. Tragically for the people who live there, this image is not entirely wrong; Africa has seen nine military coups since 2020. But like elsewhere youth in Africa are the continent’s hope, and Africa is a very young continent, with an average age in 2023 of just under nineteen. Education levels are rising though progress has been slow, due in part to a largely indifferent West. In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), despite almost innumerable setbacks, positive strides are being made and there are valuable lessons to be learned if only we would take note. DRC and its people are working to overcome deplorable handicaps to create a government that is, to borrow a phrase, by the people and for the people.</p>
<p>When DRC does get mentioned, it’s because of either disease or warfare. This is largely due to the nature of the media beast; both what it is and what it isn’t. The media consists of profit-seeking businesses, and like any business it provides us with what it knows, or at least believes, we want. What it’s not is a pacifier ready to soothe our jangled nerves. Simply put, bad news sells. The news we get out of DRC is very much a case in point. There are positive developments, but we won’t read about this in mainstream media, not because of any sort of cover-up but rather out of rational business decisions. Thus democracy is evolving in the midst of a continent deserving of far more attention than it gets.</p>
<p>But before we can get to those positives we need to illustrate the circumstances out of which they have grown. This is really the only way we can appreciate what the people of DRC have suffered and continue to endure in their ongoing and heroic attempts to free themselves and achieve what so many of the rest of us take for granted.</p>
<p>DRC lies at the very centre of the African continent. With an area of 2.3 million square kilometres, it’s the second largest African nation after Algeria. It became a Belgian colony in 1908 but Europeans had ‘discovered’ the country well before that; in 1890 Joseph Conrad spent time there and later used it as the setting for Heart of Darkness. The book is a critique both of Belgian exploitation and an attitude toward Congo, and by extension all of Africa, that persists to this day.</p>
<p>Many of us continue to think of Africa as if it was one big country when in fact it contains fifty-four fully independent nations. Ethnically and culturally it’s at least as diverse as any other continent. In terms of its natural resources, DRC is amongst the wealthiest nations on Earth but its people are amongst the poorest. The Belgian colonizers exploited the country’s rubber reserves and more recently many nations, including Canada, have taken advantage of DRC’s vast quantities of copper, cobalt, zinc, silver, gold, bauxite, uranium and coltan. In all, minerals account for 90 per cent of DRC’s exports. To illustrate just one example, eighty per cent of the world’s supply of coltan comes from DRC and that mineral is in all the cell phones and laptops you and I use every day.</p>
<p>Much of the mining in DRC is referred-to as ‘artisanal’, a euphemism which when put into plain English, means men and children, typically boys, working as miners with no safety gear and little or no equipment of any kind beyond pickaxes. The coltan in our phones and computers has very likely come from one of these ‘artisanal’ mining operations. This is in no way meant to suggest we shouldn’t own these things, only that we should be aware; that we should be ready to take positive steps to give back in some way; to end the exploitation.</p>
<p>DRC officially gained its independence from Belgium on June 30th 1960. But the country was utterly unprepared to run its own affairs since the Belgians had taken no steps to prepare their former colonials for the challenges of self-rule. A republican government was established, with both a President and Prime Minister. Patrice Lumumba, a leader of the independence movement, and the country’s first Prime Minister, was both an African nationalist and a member of the pan-African movement. This meant he supported national self-determination and believed in strengthening bonds between all indigenous Africans and the global African diaspora. He played a major role in taking the nation from colony to independence. But his left-of-centre political views, in the midst of the Cold War, made him dangerous in the eyes of several western nations, particularly the United States.</p>
<p>The independence celebrations were short-lived; within a very few days the new nation was faced with what came to be known as the Congo Crisis. With Belgian support the provinces of Katanga and South Kasai seceded and there was also a revolt by members of the military as Black soldiers were no longer willing to accept orders from white officers. The United Nations was preparing to send troops to aid the government against the secessionists but the Secretary-General, Dag Hammarskjold, made a last minute decision not to do so. In response, Lumumba called for assistance from the Soviet Union, which sent ‘military advisors’. The Soviet presence caused a split in the government between Lumumba and the President, Joseph Kasa-Vubu. It was at this point that Joseph-Désiré Mobutu Sese-Seko, a lieutenant-colonel and Lumumba’s chief military advisor, stepped in to break the deadlock by leading a coup-d’etat. Supported by both Belgium and the United States, he expelled the Soviets and established a government that supported his view of Lumumba as a danger to the country. He led a second coup in 1965 that made himself President. About 100,000 people died during this period of political conflict, including Lumumba, who was assassinated on January 17, 1961. Mobutu ruled from 1965 to 1997. In 1971 he changed the country’s name to Zaire. His thirty-year rule also saw European investors expelled and the nationalizing of their companies. He looted the nation’s treasury. In 1990 he agreed to end the ban he had imposed on a multi-party state and formed a transitional government while retaining considerable political power. In 1994 he agreed to the appointment of Kengo Wa Dondo, an advocate for free-market reforms, as Prime Minister.</p>
<p>That same year in neighbouring Rwanda, between April and July, armed groups consisting of Hutu fighters committed genocide against the Tutsi people. Over 800,000 victims, mostly Tutsis, were killed and the violence spread into DRC as small groups of Hutu extremists formed militia groups. Such militias continue to operate in DRC to this day, funded largely by the Rwandan government under the leadership of Paul Kagame. Kagame, who is Tutsi, was a commander of a militia that sought, successfully, to put an end to the genocide. However he later initiated two rebel wars in DRC, the First Congo War, from 1996 to 1997, immediately followed by the Second Congo War of 1998 to 2003. Among horrific atrocities committed was the serial rape and murder of Congolese women. Canada’s Trudeau government, usually so ready to condemn such acts, has remained entirely silent about the continuing actions of the militia groups in DRC. As recently as July 13th of 2024, seventy-two people were killed by armed militia in a village about one hundred kilometres east of the nation’s capital, Kinshasa.</p>
<p>While the equally horrific acts occurring in Ukraine are breathlessly reported within hours, this slaughter in DRC was reported in a Toronto newspaper four days after the event and was buried at the bottom of page five.</p>
<p>Mineral wealth provides the incentive for the ongoing violence. Recent reports indicate that Rwanda’s national army, somewhat ironically named the Rwandan Defence Force, has deployed as many as four thousand soldiers to DRC. Their mission appears to be aiding the militia groups and facilitating the smuggling of minerals into Rwanda. In late January of this year, Rwanda sent even more troops into DRC, in numbers that indicated full-out invasion. Along with a militia group called M23, they captured the capital of DRC’s eastern region, Goma.</p>
<p>Since the 1990s Rwandan-backed militias have taken control of coltan and other mineral-mining operations. The Congolese government estimates that it loses $1 billion (U.S.) each year because of these illegal activities. The Congolese army is fighting to halt these operations but finds itself facing an enemy that is very well armed with modern weapons such as so-called mortar drones. Desertion is also a significant factor, as the militia groups pay their soldiers better wages than DRC can pay. People continue to be forced to flee their homes, a harsh reality in eastern DRC for almost thirty years. This violence has also resulted in severe food shortages as farms are abandoned in areas controlled by militia groups. The only realistic way to put an end to all this would be to confront the Rwandan government directly, with military force if needed. Why this has gone on all this time with no response from the West is a matter for conjecture, though it’s by no means far-fetched to suggest having access to relatively cheap minerals plays a role. A case can also be made that Western governments feel no pressure to act because their citizens are uninformed by media.</p>
<p>DRC has also been plagued by outbreaks of disease. In 1976 the country made headlines due to the outbreak of Ebola, a disease named after a tributary of the Congo River. The Ebola virus was first detected in a village about 110 kilometres from the river but it was decided to name the disease Ebola in order to avoid having the village become forever known as the starting point of this often - though not always - fatal pathogen. There have been subsequent outbreaks that have killed thousands of people. Work to create vaccines began to make progress in 2014. The World Health Organization did much to speed the process and an effective vaccine began to be used in 2016. Recent outbreaks have been quickly brought under control.</p>
<p>There are organizations in the West who lay claim to knowledge of the situation in DRC. Freedom House, a Washington D.C.- based non-profit that assesses how democratic various nations are, continues to list DRC as “not free”. However, a review of current trends suggests that the Freedom House ranking should be reviewed.</p>
<p>In January 2019, when Felix Tshisekedi became President, it marked the first time since independence that the presidency was peacefully transferred from one political party to another. Tshisekedi freed seven hundred political prisoners jailed by his predecessor. Understanding that education is vital to building a free and democratic state, he also invested heavily in schools for DRC’s next generation.</p>
<p>In December 2023 he faced another election, as the country’s constitution requires. Western media tended to focus on claims of voting irregularities that originated mostly with defeated candidates. Voter turnout was 48.8 per cent despite three provinces being unable to safely participate due to ongoing militia violence. That figure marks a small but important increase from the prior election in 2018 when 45.5 per cent of eligible voters cast a ballot (voter turnout in the Ontario election of 2022 was forty-three per cent). Tshisekedi was re-elected by a comfortable margin and reports from well-informed sources within DRC state that the majority of Congolais believe the election was run fairly, the results are credible and that the re-elected President had achieved some positive change that ordinary citizens could see for themselves. The really crucial point is this: if the majority of people in DRC see themselves as living in a democracy, how legitimate can it be for outsiders like Freedom House to claim otherwise?</p>
<p>DRC is just one of many countries that has had a long, hard struggle to achieve democracy, and the hard work of maintaining what has been won never stops. The people of that nation have overcome crushing obstacles, and the progress they’ve made continues to be under siege by those both in Africa and abroad who have very different interests.</p>
<p>Democracy doesn’t just happen by itself. It must be fought for and constantly supported by an informed and active electorate. The people of DRC have learned this vital lesson while too many of us in the West appear to have forgotten it.</p>

<p>React Native and Flutter are by far the most popular cross-platform development technologies, as previously covered in the deepdive, <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/cross-platform-mobile-development">Cross-platform mobile development</a>. React Native (made by Meta) seems more popular in the US and UK, and at mid to large-sized companies, while Flutter (made by Google) powers more apps overall, globally.</p><p>But there’s also one other company that consistently comes up in talk about cross-platform mobile technologies: Expo. When the Bluesky team shared their cross-platform tech stack, they <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/bluesky-engineering-culture">mentioned</a> that it was React Native and Expo. Meanwhile, the React Native “getting started” guide strongly advises starting development with Expo, and calls it “a production-grade React Native Framework.”</p><p>So, what is Expo and why is it so important for cross-platform React Native development?</p><p>A year ago, I travelled to California and visited Expo’s offices in Palo Alto, meeting with the team to find out more; a few months later, I got back in touch for extra details on how Expo works, and to learn what makes it popular. This deepdive covers:</p>  <p>Why is Expo popular? It played a large role making React Native as widespread as it is today, and its developer focus has been a big factor.</p>  <p>History. Expo began in dissatisfaction about the clunkiness of developing and shipping mobile apps.

Their input is appreciated!</p><p>As with every deepdive we publish, The Pragmatic Engineer has no commercial affiliation with the company featured, and was not paid to write about them in this article. More in <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/ethics-statement/">our ethics statement</a>.</p> 1. Why is Expo popular? <p>Expo is a startup based in Palo Alto, California, employing 32 people, 29 of whom are developers – a surprisingly high ratio of 90%. The company <a href="https://expo.dev/about">lists employees</a> on its about page. The ratio at larger software companies like Meta, Google, or Microsoft is rarely above 30-40%, due to the presence of other teams like sales, support, and many other support functions.</p><p>Today, the open source Expo framework is used in more than 1 million public Github repositories, and has more than 800,000 downloads per week. The project is very active: more than 1,300 developers contribute in total, and there were more than 50,000 members of the Discord channel at time of publication.</p><p>Expo may be the biggest reason why React Native became as popular as Flutter. These days, when I hear a company develops with React Native, it almost always follows that they use Expo, too. This is because it has developer tools which make even the best cross-platform framework much less clunky to develop on for the iOS and Android native platforms.</p><p>For Flutter, similarly solid developer tooling which Google built and maintained has long been a differentiator; the search giant built <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/devtools">sophisticated tools</a> to debug, profile and diagnose Flutter applications. However, getting started with Flutter still requires a <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/macos/mobile-ios">multi-step developer environment setup</a>, while shipping iOS and Android apps is <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/android">a pretty involved process</a>, compared with the simplest ways of getting started with React Native and Expo:</p><p>Just open the website snack.expo.dev.</p><p>This is the site called “Expo Snack,” where you can immediately start to do live editing on a React Native application that runs on an Android emulator, an iOS emulator, or a web view:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F86dd398f-6677-47a9-a13c-9e318d760966_1600x1110.png">          </a>An app built in two minutes without installing anything, running on a remote iOS simulator. Image: <a href="https://snack.expo.dev/">Expo Snack</a> <p>You can also run the app on your mobile device by scanning a QR code and installing the Expo Go app. I also did this – and the app live updated as I made changes. With such little effort required, this felt magical.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc7f6ebe6-59f0-4910-b031-8faa11554cd2_1272x1128.png">          </a>A React Native app running on my phone as a native app, after a few minutes of coding and zero dev environment setup <p>Being able to live edit an app with zero development tooling feels magical, even in 2025. Developing with no tools installed locally is not possible when doing native iOS or Android development. Google’s cloud development environment, <a href="https://idx.google.com/">Project IDX</a>, comes close, but it’s not as snappy. Meanwhile, Expo Snack is just one of many developer-first features produced by Expo’s small team, that’s on a par with Apple and Google tools. More below on Expo’s development tooling in the sections, “What is Expo?” and “Shipping to production.”</p><p>Why do companies move to Expo? We asked the Bluesky engineering team, who are heavy React Native users – and whom we previously covered in the deepdive <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/bluesky-engineering-culture">Inside Bluesky’s engineering culture</a>. Here’s what Paul Frazee – the dev who built the initial Bluesky’s iOS, Android, and web applications, using a single codebase – told us:</p><blockquote><p>“We were initially manually building the app using Xcode and Android Studio, then uploading the builds.</p><p>The reason we first looked at Expo was to help us with deployments. Expo has a really solid cloud-build infrastructure (EAS Build) and over-the-air update system (EAS Update). We looked at the other React Native cloud build services and none of them seemed as well built, so we took a chance with Expo. We found ourselves iteratively adopting expo modules, and then moved fully into their framework. My only regret is that we didn’t start with it. It’s not often that I have such a positive experience.</p><p>We started migrating over to Expo around 9 months into app development, around February 2023. This was when we had a pretty mature app. It was an iterative migration that went pretty smoothly.”</p></blockquote> 2. History <p>As previously mentioned, Expo was founded out of frustration at how long it takes to build a mobile app. In 2012, Charlie Cheever was CTO at Quora and working on an iOS and Android app for the Q&amp;A site. Being a hands-on developer with extensive web experience (he was an early engineer at Facebook), he assumed it would take at most a few weeks to build each native app. However, it actually took months per platform, and included terrible developer experiences on both iOS and Android; at least, compared to the web. From this came the idea for Expo. Charlie sums up the objective:</p><blockquote><p>“The web is a pretty good way of doing development and it’s so powerful. Let’s take everything that’s good about the web and web development and make the mobile development space better.”</p></blockquote><p>He teamed up with James Ide and they started experimenting with ways of using web technologies to build mobile apps, eventually ending up with a framework that wrapped mobile-native components; basically something pretty similar to React Native. They were about to launch when React Native was released, which was created and used by Meta, with around 40 people working on it. In contrast, the as yet-unreleased Expo framework was developed by two people.</p><p>Rather than compete with React Native, Expo decided to embrace it. Charlie and James understood that coding an app was just one of the many parts of shipping a cross-platform app. Every developer using React Native still had other problem areas to solve:</p>  <p>Distribution to the iOS and Android App Stores</p>  <p>Release strategies</p>  <p>CI pipelines</p>  <p>Improving the developer experience</p>  <p>“Exponent” was the first product the team shipped; a React Native development tool that sat a level above React Native. The team <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaxZMDP6eDA">announced</a> it in 2015 at a React conference called React Rally. It took care of things like:</p>  <p>Dealing with Xcode and Android Studio</p>  <p>Provisioning profiles for iOS</p>  <p>Development and deployment certificates</p>  <p>Any Objective-C, Swift and Java-specific things</p>   <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F45dad71a-502c-4c27-97f6-ee6ebb4309d8_1522x888.png">          </a>Sketch of the explanation used to introduce Exponent in 2015 <p>The Exponent toolset kept evolving, and two years later in 2017, the name changed to Expo because it’s easier to say and remember. From 2017, Expo kept shipping new, major releases to Expo SDK several times per year. Back then, Expo’s SDK was on version 21; today, it’s on version 52. The company maintains a changelog <a href="https://expo.dev/changelog">listing notable changes</a>, and a <a href="https://github.com/expo/expo/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md">detailed changelog</a>.</p> 3. React Native vs a React Native Framework <p>Expo is a framework and set of tools that uses React Native (RN), and simplifies the development of RN applications. It also happens to be the only React Native Framework considered as production-grade, currently. But what is a “React Native Framework?” As React Native builds on top of React, let’s see how things work in the React world.</p> React vs React Frameworks <p>React: providing core capabilities. React is a JavaScript library for building web user interfaces.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff87f67fb-f5ab-48f9-9fdd-e3363d5ab4be_1600x725.png">          </a>React code using the markup called JSX, a JavaScript syntax extension popularized by React which supports HTML-like rendering logic. Source: <a href="https://react.dev/">React</a> <p>React takes care of many things, like:</p>  <p>High performance: using a Virtual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model">DOM</a>, React creates an in-memory data structure cache of the UI, computes the resulting differences, and updates the browser’s DOM only as needed. This process is called reconciliation and produces better performance</p>  <p>JSX: support for the JSX syntax extension to allow using HTML-like code within JavaScript</p>  <p>Reusable UI components: the core of React is reusable components. React specifies how to define components, their lifecycle events, nesting, <a href="https://react.dev/learn/passing-props-to-a-component">communicating</a> between them, rendering differently based <a href="https://react.dev/learn/conditional-rendering">on different conditions</a>, and <a href="https://react.dev/learn/your-first-component">more</a></p>  <p>Handling events like clicking, hovering, keyboard inputs, swiping, <a href="https://react.dev/learn/responding-to-events">etc</a>.</p>  <p>UI state management: an opinionated way to manage state. Instead of manipulating individual parts of the UI, React uses a <a href="https://react.dev/learn/reacting-to-input-with-state">declarative approach</a></p>  <p>Other features like <a href="https://react.dev/learn/typescript">support for TypeScript</a>, <a href="https://react.dev/reference/react/hooks">React Hooks</a> (using React features from components), and support for <a href="https://react.dev/blog/2023/03/22/react-labs-what-we-have-been-working-on-march-2023#react-server-components">server components</a>, among others.</p>   <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5cad761-bf99-4e9f-8f3c-ca3d9cbf3063_1600x814.png">          </a>The simplest React component. The React framework specifies how to create these, and has support for even complex use cases for components. Source: <a href="http://v">React</a> <p>React Frameworks: providing production-grade capabilities. You can build web applications only using React. However, the more complex and larger an application gets, the more additional features must be built, like routing between pages, code-splitting between several files, fetching data, moving some rendering to the server, and so on. Here’s what the React team says about frameworks in the <a href="https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project">getting started guide</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“You can use React without a framework, however we’ve found that most apps and sites eventually build solutions to common problems such as code-splitting, routing, data fetching, and generating HTML. These problems are common to all UI libraries, not just React.</p><p>By starting with a framework, you can get started with React quickly, and avoid essentially building your own framework later.”</p></blockquote><p>The React team lists three “production-grade” frameworks, defined by:</p>  <p>Support for all features needed to deploy and scale apps in production</p>  <p>Open source</p>  <p>Can be deployed to a personal server or a hosting provider</p>  <p>React Frameworks which meet these conditions, and are recommended by the React team:</p>  <p>Next.js: the Pages Router of Next.js is a full-stack React framework. It’s versatile and lets you create React apps of any size, from a mostly static blog, to a complex dynamic application. Maintained by Vercel.</p>  <p>Remix: a full-stack React framework with nested routing. It lets you break an app into nested parts that can load data in parallel and refresh in response to user actions. Maintained by Shopify.</p>  <p>Gatsby: a React framework for fast CMS-backed websites. Its rich plugin ecosystem and GraphQL data layer simplify integrating content, APIs, and services into one website. Maintained by Netlify.</p>  <p>React is funded by Meta, but React frameworks are funded by other companies. Vercel and Netlify are hosting providers and fund the frameworks as it helps drive adoption of their services. Remix was acquired by Shopify, and is being <a href="https://remix.run/blog/merging-remix-and-react-router#whats-happening-to-remix">merged into</a> React Router.</p> React Native vs a React Native Framework <p>Considering the differences between React and React Frameworks, it’s likely to be unsurprising that React Native has a similar concept split between “core” React Native features, and production-ready features which frameworks should provide.</p><p>React Native offers core APIs and capabilities to build native apps. It’s a framework that allows using the React programming paradigm to build native iOS and Android applications, which offers:</p>  <p>A runtime for JavaScript and the React syntax, with the ability to augment it using native iOS and Android extensions</p>  <p>Similar-enough performance to native-only applications</p>  <p>Continual support for modern React features like <a href="https://react.dev/blog/2022/03/29/react-v18#new-suspense-features">Suspense</a> (declaratively specifying the loading part of a component tree), <a href="https://react.dev/blog/2022/03/29/react-v18#new-feature-transitions">Transitions</a> (distinguishing between urgent and non-urgent updates), <a href="https://react.dev/blog/2022/03/29/react-v18#new-feature-automatic-batching">automatic batching</a> (grouping multiple re-renders into a single re-render for better performance) and others</p>  <p>APIs <a href="https://reactnative.dev/docs/next/turbo-native-modules-introduction">to invoke</a> native iOS or Android APIs</p>  <p>Hot reloading: during development, see changes made in the code update on the emulator or device in around a second</p>  <p>React Native frameworks provide production-grade capability: The React Native team follows an RFC approach for discussions and proposals. In 2024, the team opened an <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/blob/main/proposals/0759-react-native-frameworks.md#what-do-we-recommend-to-react-native-library-developers">RFC for React Native frameworks</a> and arrived at the following definition of a RN framework:</p><blockquote><p>“Shipping native apps to production usually requires a set of tools &amp; libraries that are not provided by default as part of React Native, but are still crucial to hit the ship to production. Examples of such tools are: support for publishing applications to a dedicated store, or support for routing and navigation mechanisms.</p><p>When those tools &amp; libraries are collected to form a cohesive framework built on top of React Native, we call this a React Native Framework.</p><p>A practical example of bespoke React Native Framework is how Meta uses React Native internally. We do have a collection of libraries, scripts and tools that make the integration of React Native easier with the various apps where it's used.”</p></blockquote><p>Expo: the only production-grade open source RN framework available today. At the time of publishing, the React Native team only recommends Expo as a production-grade framework. This is a very strong recommendation, given that the same team also <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/blob/main/proposals/0759-react-native-frameworks.md#what-do-we-recommend-to-react-native-library-developers">writes</a> this about React Native frameworks:</p><blockquote><p>“You’re either using a React Native Framework or you’re building your own React Native Framework”</p></blockquote><p>So how did Meta end up recommending Expo? Charlie explains:</p><blockquote><p>“I’d clarify the recommendation a tiny bit: the Meta team’s guidance about React Native is that you’re going to need to use some framework with it to build anything real. If you don’t choose an off the shelf one, you’re going to end up having to build one yourself.</p><p>Today, Expo is the only very mature React Native framework. However, if tomorrow another team comes along and builds another really good React Native framework, everyone would welcome this.”</p></blockquote><p>Collaboration with Meta started early, as Brent Vatne, engineering manager at Expo, recalls:</p><blockquote><p>“A few of us have been contributors to React Native since the earliest days, the initial preview release at React Conf 2015. We’ve demonstrated through our involvement for nearly 10 years that we are deeply invested in the success of React Native, and can be relied on to collaborate on everything from conference talks to some of the largest initiatives on the open source side of the project.</p><p>For example, over the past year we have been working closely with the React Native team at Meta on getting the <a href="https://reactnative.dev/blog/2024/10/23/the-new-architecture-is-here">New Architecture for React Native</a> ready to roll out to open source. We helped prepare the ecosystem by migrating all of our tooling at Expo, using dependency statistics to determine the most impactful third party libraries and helping to migrate them, reporting and/or fixing related issues that we encounter in React Native, educating the community, and many other projects that come out of rolling out such a significant change.”</p></blockquote><p>Expo seems to fill a gap in a way that helps Meta, by making React Native more accessible for external developers. Charlie:</p><blockquote><p>“Meta’s focus is mostly about making React Native work great inside Meta, and ours is to make it work great outside of Meta. Meta doesn’t directly benefit from making React Native open source and most of their team’s focus is on making it work really well for them. So there’s a natural way that we’re able to fit together in a way that everyone wins!”</p></blockquote><p>React Native by itself does not support tools necessary to deploy and scale an app that is production-grade. Meta has its own production-grade React Native framework, which is tailored to its needs and its <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/facebook">vast number of custom internal tools</a>. So it’s a win for Meta to have a company building a more generic production framework to build React Native apps with.</p> 4. Expo: collection of developer tools <p>Expo makes it easier to build production-grade React Native apps by providing additional abstractions (like routing) and tools (like a command line) to make building apps faster. It brings these added features to React Native development, built on top of React Native:</p>

<p>Polen, das derzeit den Vorsitz im EU-Rat innehat, <a href="https://cdn.netzpolitik.org/wp-upload/2025/01/2025-01-30-conseil-pl-compromis-reglement-csam.pdf">schlägt eine wichtige Änderung des viel kritisierten EU-Vorschlags zur Chatkontrolle vor</a>: Anstatt die generelle Durchsuchung privater Chats anzuordnen soll die Chatkontrolle wie bisher im Ermessen der Anbieter stehen. Vertreter der EU-Regierungen werden den Vorschlag in der EU-Arbeitsgruppe für Strafverfolgung <a href="https://www.parlament.gv.at/dokument/XXVIII/EU/9693/imfname_11447708.pdf">am Mittwoch beraten</a>.</p>



<p>“Der neue Vorschlag ist ein Durchbruch und im Kampf um unser digitales Briefgeheimnis ein großer Sprung nach vorn”, kommentiert Patrick Breyer (Piratenpartei), ehemaliges Mitglied des Europäischen Parlaments und digitaler Freiheitskämpfer. “Der Vorschlag würde sichere Verschlüsselung schützen und damit die Sicherheit unserer Smartphones. Allerdings blieben drei grundlegende Probleme ungelöst:</p>



<p>1. Massenüberwachung: Selbst wenn Anbieter wie Meta, Microsoft oder Google die Chatkontrolle “freiwillig” praktizieren, ist sie immer noch eine völlig ungezielte und wahllose Massenüberwachung aller privaten Nachrichten über diese Dienste. Nach Angaben der EU-Kommission sind etwa 75 % der Millionen privater Chats, Fotos und Videos, die jedes Jahr von den unzuverlässigen Chatkontrollalgorithmen der Industrie geleakt werden, nicht strafrechtlich relevant und lassen unsere intime Kommunikation in die Hände Unbekannter gelangen, bei denen sie nicht sicher ist und bei denen sie nichts zu suchen hat. Eine ehemalige Richterin des Europäischen Gerichtshofs, <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Legal-Opinion-Screening-for-child-pornography-2021-03-04.pdf">Ninon Colneric</a> (S. 34 f.), und der <a href="https://www.edps.europa.eu/system/files/2024-02/24-01-24_opinion_sexuellen_missbrauchs_kindern_internet_de.pdf">Europäische Datenschutzbeauftragte</a> (Abs. 11) haben gewarnt, dass diese wahllose Überwachung gegen unsere Grundrechte verstößt, selbst wenn sie im Ermessen der Anbieter liegt. In Schleswig-Holstein und Bayern sind bereits zwei Klagen gegen diese Praxis anhängig. </p>



<p>Das Europäische Parlament <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/beitraege/chatkontrolle/#epmandat">schlägt einen anderen Ansatz vor</a>: Die Telekommunikationsüberwachung soll verpflichtend angeordnet werden können, aber auf Personen oder Gruppen beschränkt werden, die mit sexuellem Kindesmissbrauch in Verbindung stehen. Das Parlament schlägt außerdem vor, dass die Anbieter ihre Dienste durch eine Reihe von Voreinstellungen, Nachfragen und Warnungen sicherer für junge Menschen gestalten müssen.</p>



<p>2. Digitaler Hausarrest: Nach dem von Polen unverändert vorgeschlagenen Artikel 6 könnten Nutzer unter 16 Jahren künftig zu ihrem eigenen Schutz vor sexueller Annäherung alltägliche Apps aus dem App-Store nicht mehr installieren. Dazu gehören Messenger-Apps wie Whatsapp, Snapchat, Telegram oder Twitter, Social-Media-Apps wie Instagram, TikTok oder Facebook, Spiele wie FIFA, Minecraft, GTA, Call of Duty, Roblox, Dating-Apps, Videokonferenz-Apps wie Zoom, Skype, Facetime. Ein solches Mindestalter wäre leicht zu umgehen und würde Jugendliche bevormunden und isolieren, anstatt sie zu stärken.</p>



<p>3. Verbot anonymer Kommunikation: Nach dem von Polen unverändert vorgeschlagenen Artikel 4 (3) wäre es Nutzern künftig nicht mehr möglich, anonyme E-Mail- oder Messenger-Konten einzurichten oder anonym zu chatten, ohne einen Ausweis oder ihr Gesicht vorzeigen zu müssen, wodurch sie identifizierbar würden und das Risiko von Datenlecks entstünde. Dies würde z. B. sensible Chats zum Thema Sexualität, anonyme Pressekommunikation mit Quellen (z. B. Whistleblowern) sowie politische Aktivitäten einschränken.</p>



<p>Alles in allem ist der polnische Vorschlag im Vergleich zu den bisherigen Texten ein großer Fortschritt in Bezug auf unsere Sicherheit im Internet, aber er erfordert noch gravierende Nachbesserungen. Gleichzeitig geht der Vorschlag wahrscheinlich schon zu weit für die Hardliner-Mehrheit der EU-Regierungen und die EU-Kommission, deren Überwachungshunger bisher stets so extrem war, dass sie die Opfer lieber ohne Einigung ganz im Stich lassen als eine verhältnismäßige, gerichtsfeste und politisch mehrheitsfähige Alternative zur Chatkontrolle zu akzeptieren.”</p>

 Elevator Pitch for Quantum Realism 
 
<p>Quantum Realism proposes that the physical universe is not fundamental but instead a virtual construct generated by a self-sustaining quantum network or primal consciousness. The physical phenomena we observe, including space, time, energy and matter, are outputs of this underlying quantum process, more like a computational system where the quantum field serves as the substrate for reality. Unlike classical realism, which treats matter as independent and static, Quantum Realism views the universe as a dynamic, evolving system, continuously shaped by observation and interaction.</p>
<p>This theory aligns with the strange findings of modern physics, such as quantum superposition, entanglement, and the observer effect. These phenomena indicate that reality behaves more like information being processed than a collection of static objects. By grounding itself in the principles of quantum mechanics and information theory, Quantum Realism provides a framework that explains physical laws but also integrates consciousness as an active participant in the unfolding of reality.&nbsp;</p>
 
  How Quantum Realism Differs from Other Theories 
 
<p>Quantum Realism stands apart by uniting consciousness and matter within a single quantum substrate. Classical physics focuses on deterministic interactions of matter, while dualism separates consciousness from the material. Quantum Realism suggests that matter emerges from the consciousness field, which acts as a self-generative, non-physical substrate. This explains phenomena like wave-particle duality and the observer effect, where the act of measurement collapses probabilities into specific outcomes.</p>
<p>In contrast to other simulation theories, which claim an external programmer, Quantum Realism describes a holographic reality that is self-generating, requiring no external creator. The consciousness quantum network acts as both the origin and sustainer of reality, dynamically evolving through recursive feedback loops. By embedding consciousness within this process, Quantum Realism resolves the paradox of how non-physical awareness can influence a seemingly physical world, offering a more integrated perspective than either dualism or materialism.</p>
 
  What Led You to This Investigation? 
 
<p>Stemming from my childhood curiosity of electricity and of light, I started learning the math that was required. It was the whole concept of imaginary numbers that got me questioning reality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The idea that light oscillates into a imaginary 4th dimension emerged from the mathematical framework of quantum mechanics. I later discovered Imaginary numbers are fundamental to describing oscillatory behavior in wavefunctions, suggesting that light and other quantum phenomena extend beyond the three spatial dimensions we perceive. This mathematical insight led me to consider whether these higher-dimensional oscillations underpin the strange behaviors observed in quantum systems, such as superposition and entanglement.</p>
<p>For me this opened a pathway to investigate how higher-dimensional processes might generate the physical universe as a lower-dimensional projection. By focusing on the recursive nature of these oscillations, I began exploring how reality could arise from iterative feedback within a quantum network. This exploration ties into Quantum Realism’s premise that space, time, and matter are emergent constructs, projected from the recursive operations of the quantum field.</p>
 
  The Circle of Values 
 
<p>Everything in the universe oscillates (light waves, matter waves, and even biological rhythms) indicating an underlying recursive principle. This principle, that I refer to as the “Circle of Values,” describes how primal consciousness perpetuates creation through cyclic processes. Each oscillation represents a feedback loop in which information from the quantum field interacts with localized nodes, generating structure and coherence across scales. These cycles are fractal-like, with self-similar patterns appearing at every level of reality, from quantum fluctuations to galactic rotations.</p>
<p>This recursive behavior mirrors the properties of fractal mathematics, where complexity arises from simple iterative rules. In Quantum Realism, the Circle of Values represents consciousness in action, continuously manifesting and sustaining the fabric of reality. By oscillating through states, this process generates not only physical structures but also the informational coherence necessary for life and awareness to emerge, illustrating the very deep interconnection between consciousness and the material world.</p>
 
  Holographic Reality vs. Simulations 
 
<p>A holographic reality differs fundamentally from a simulation in that it requires no external programmer or hardware. Instead, it emerges intrinsically from within the quantum field itself, with every fractal part containing information about the whole. This self-generative nature is supported by quantum entanglement, where particles separated by vast distances remain instantaneously correlated. Such behavior suggests that reality operates like a hologram, where local phenomena reflect an interconnected structure.</p>
<p>In contrast to simulations, which rely on predefined algorithms and external input, a holographic reality evolves dynamically through feedback between consciousness agents and the quantum network. This perspective resolves the apparent separation between observer and observed, as both are integrated within the same system. Quantum Realism states that the universe is not a static construct but a living, self-referential system that adapts and evolves as consciousness interacts with it.</p>
 
  Free Will: Participants or Puppets? 
 
<p>Quantum Realism portrays localized consciousness as an active participant in shaping reality. While physical parameters provide constraints (such as natural laws and probabilities) free will emerges as consciousness influences the collapse of quantum states. The observer effect demonstrates this participatory role, where the act of measurement determines which potential becomes reality. Thus, consciousness is not merely a bystander but an integral component of the quantum network.</p>
<p>This dynamic allows for meaningful choice within the parameters of the system. While deterministic factors like genetics and environment play a role, the ability of consciousness to interact with the quantum field introduces variability and agency. In this way, Quantum Realism reconciles the apparent tension between determinism and free will, framing individuals as co-creators within an evolving reality.</p>
 
  What Is Quantization? 
 
<p>Quantization is the process by which continuous possibilities are restricted to discrete units, such as energy levels in an atom. This principle is essential for the stability of physical systems, as it prevents infinite regress and ensures coherence. Without quantization, systems would lack the precision needed for consistent behavior, leading to paradoxes like infinite energy densities in classical physics.</p>
<p>In Quantum Realism, quantization also reflects the underlying processing structure of the quantum network. By discretizing energy, time, and space, the system ensures that interactions remain finite and manageable, enabling the emergence of stable structures like atoms and molecules. This discrete framework not only resolves the infinities problem but also provides a foundation for understanding how coherence and order arise in a fundamentally quantum reality.</p>
 
  Time, Causality, and Superposition 
 
<p>In Quantum Realism, time is not an absolute backdrop but an emergent property of processing cycles within the quantum field. Each cycle represents a discrete step in the evolution of reality, giving rise to the ordered flow of events we perceive as time. Superposition, where particles exist in multiple states simultaneously, reflects the quantum field’s ability to hold and process many potentials before they are collapsed into specific outcomes.</p>
<p>Causality emerges from this collapse, as interactions within the quantum network resolve probabilities into ordered sequences. This dynamic interplay between potential and actualization creates the linear progression we experience, while superposition ensures that the system retains flexibility and adaptability. Together, these principles demonstrate how time, causality, and quantum phenomena are deeply interconnected within the framework of Quantum Realism.</p>
 
  The Role of Our 3D Bodies 
 
<p>Our 3D bodies serve as localized nodes within the quantum network, enabling consciousness to interact with the virtual constructs of space and time. By acting as receivers and processors of quantum information, these bodies provide the specificity and coherence needed for complex interactions, such as perception, learning, and decision-making. This localized embodiment allows consciousness to experience and express reality in a focused and constrained way, facilitating exploration and growth.</p>
<p>At the quantum level, our bodies are composed of informational systems governed by quantized interactions, such as atomic vibrations and molecular bonds. These interactions provide the stability necessary for biological processes, while also linking us to the larger quantum network. This dual role (as both physical entities and conduits for consciousness) illustrates the magnificent integration of body, mind, and the quantum substrate.</p>
 
  Reflections on Itzhak Bentov’s Premise 
 
<p>Though admittedly I don’t know much about Bentov, his idea that life represents organized information gifted back to the cosmos aligns with Quantum Realism’s view of consciousness as a dynamic contributor to the quantum field. Each life accumulates unique experiences, which are reintegrated into the system upon death, enriching its informational density and coherence. This cyclical process mirrors the conservation of energy and information observed in physical systems.</p>
<p>By framing life as an exchange of information between localized consciousness and the quantum network, Quantum Realism provides a holistic view of existence. Death is not an end but a transition, where individual contributions are folded back into the universal substrate, furthering the evolution of the system as a whole. This perspective offers both a scientific, existential and spiritual understanding of life’s purpose and continuity.</p>
 
  Hope in Navigating 3D Reality 
 
<p>Quantum Realism offers a hopeful perspective by framing life as an integral part of a coherent, meaningful process. By recognizing that consciousness actively shapes reality, individuals can embrace their role as co-creators within this evolving system. This participatory view inspires purpose and creativity, transforming challenges into opportunities for growth and contribution.</p>
<p>The recursive and interconnected nature of the quantum network suggests that even small actions can have far-reaching effects. This reinforces the idea that every individual’s choices matter, contributing to the larger process of coherence and complexity. In this way, Quantum Realism not only explains the nature of reality but also provides a framework for navigating it with intention and hope.</p>

<p>You would have to be living under a rock to have missed all the talk about Agentic AI, and <a href="https://hbr.org/2024/12/what-is-agentic-ai-and-how-will-it-change-work">how it is going to revolutionize the way we live and work</a>.

Article after article is devoted to <a href="https://scet.berkeley.edu/the-next-next-big-thing-agentic-ais-opportunities-and-risks/">both the opportunities and the risks</a>. And when it comes to risk, all of us working in the Digital Identity space are not prepared for what is coming.</p>

<p>In the wake of OpenAI <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/openai-launches-operator-an-ai-agent-that-can-operate-your-computer/">releasing Operator</a>, a Computer-Using Agent (CUA), in research preview, I’ve read many breathless posts about the future of Web-based Agentic AI (as opposed to API-based Agentic AI), and how it makes every website “programmable”, even without APIs. If you have worked in software development, you can visualize the mechanics easily – it’s like giving a QA Automation tool like Selenium WebDriver a brain, so that instead of just automating web applications for rinse-and-repeat testing, it can actually read the data, make decisions, adjust course, and take action. That framing should also make it easy to immediately grok how this will break the identity and security infrastructure we currently have, or are putting in place. I mean, we have been dealing with these in our QA Automation projects forever. I thought I’d share the thoughts that immediately jumped to my mind, mostly because I need to not be the only one worrying about these (#MiseryLovesCompany).</p>



<p>1) Bypassing/Breaking/Compromising Authentication Mechanisms</p>



<p>Since CUAs rely on web-based browsing, they necessarily run into some of the same break points that QA automation runs into – like multi factor authentication, bot verification techniques, and more. Any CUA would currently have to give the user back control of the browser to take these actions before proceeding. This high friction point is going to run head first into consumer dissatisfaction and business mandates to “just make it work”, and all of us in identity can guess exactly what will follow:</p>



 
 Users will hand over passwords to their Agent service so it can log in as them, or grant them access to their password managers (probably as a feature getting built into first the browser password manager and then the generic password managers). 



 Users will turn off MFA to allow their agents to work. 



 Any guesses on what will happen to passkeys? If syncing of the private key was the worst that you thought could happen…. 



 There will people looking at how authorized session hijacking can become a feature to leverage, much like how Selenium allows direct manipulation of cookies and local storage, enabling agents to hoover up valid session tokens and bypass login screens. Case in point: <a href="https://github.com/JoshMayerr/passport-mcp">Build MCP servers for any website with automatic browser auth syncing</a> 



 Just like Selenium can sometimes bypass automation (bot) detection protections using headless browsing and user-agent spoofing, expect Agentic AI tools to develop capabilities to do the same. 
 



<p>2) Violating Authorization Boundaries (When They Exist)</p>



<p>QA Automation scripts often execute actions as a high-privilege test user (e.g., an admin account) to avoid breaking tests that are verifying functionality but not data or access restrictions. The rush to deploy Web-based Agentic AI tools will mean that like other tools of the past, it won’t be built with proper scope controls, thereby driving implementors to grant it excessive privileges. You can guess the rest.</p>



<p>As for consumer applications, those rarely have differentiated access control models built in for their users. That means a customer that wants to use a CUA, but limit what it can and cannot do will be out of luck. We saw this play out in the days of screenscraping-based personal finance applications, and how long it took for us to move everyone over to OAuth2 and FAPI as the better and more secure approach.</p>



<p>3) Weakening Security Controls</p>



<p>(aka “Is that a DDoS attack, or an army of Agents here to take advantage of the limited time deal we announced?”)</p>



<p>It won’t just be Authentication controls that are impacted. There are many security protections that will likely be obstacles in the path of Web-based Agentic AI. Would any of us be surprised to find out that IT teams were told to weaken or disable security mechanisms (e.g., Content Security Policy, SameSite cookies, Bot and DDoS detection) to facilitate automated agents, inadvertently creating vulnerabilities?</p>



<p>And these are just what immediately jumped to mind. I am sure there are many more that I’m not even thinking of.</p>



<p>Identity vendors and practitioners everywhere really need to shift into high gear to help organizations properly prepare for what’s headed their way. The demand to support Web-based Agentic AI will put a great deal of pressure on them to enable safe acceptance, and being the “Agent of No” (see what I did there) is not likely to go well. As for what can be done – more on that later.</p>

<p>This post looks at customizing the sign-in UI and the sign-in options in an ASP.NET Core application using Duende IdentityServer and ASP.NET Core Identity. There are multiple ways of changing the look and feel of the UI for different OpenID Connect clients or different client flows.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/duende-multi-tenant">https://github.com/damienbod/duende-multi-tenant</a></p>

 <a href="https://damienbod.com/2025/02/03/multiple-client-sign-in-customizations-using-duende-identity-provider/">Customizing a single client sign-in using parameters in Duende IdentityServer</a> 
 



 Setup 



<p>The solution is setup using three different ASP.NET Core applications. In the example code, the “Admin” application has different federation authentication options compared to the “Shop” client authentication sign-in experience. The client ID from the authentication context is used to customize the look and feel, i.e. the styles, the layout and the options of the client are used to define which federation and authentication options are possible.</p>







<p></p>



 Customization of the sign-in options 



<p>The EnableLocalLogin parameter and the IdentityProviderRestrictions parameter from Duende IdentityServer can be used to change the sign-in options for the end user of the applications. If the EnableLocalLogin  option is set to false, the define username, password login is disabled. The IdentityProviderRestrictions  setting can be used to define which federation options are allowed for the client sign-in.</p>


  new Client
{
    ClientId = "shop-client-ui",
    
	// more client options ... 

    // show/hide the local authentication screen
    EnableLocalLogin = false

    // federated authentication options to display
	// empty displays all
    IdentityProviderRestrictions = ["AdminEntraID"]
},
  


<p></p>



 Layout Customization for clients 



<p>Sometimes the identity provider application need to display a different look and feel for the different clients. To achieve this, a separate login screen is used and each login screen uses a different layout. The layout and the style are changed using the client ID from the authorization context. If the shop client is used, the user is redirect to a different Razor Page. The UseShopClientDisplay bool is used for this.</p>


  private async Task BuildModelAsync(string? returnUrl)
{
    Input = new InputModel
    {
        ReturnUrl = returnUrl
    };

    var context = await _interaction.GetAuthorizationContextAsync(returnUrl);
    if (context?.Client.ClientId == "shop-client-ui")
    {
        View = new ViewModel
        {
            UseShopClientDisplay = true
        };
        
        // Process in the shop client login
        return;
    }

    // standard code from duende template
}
  


<p></p>



<p>In the Login Razor Page on get method, the user is redirected to a different layout if the UseShopClientDisplay is true. The returnUrl is passed as a parameter.</p>


  public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; OnGet(string? returnUrl)
{
    await BuildModelAsync(returnUrl);

    if (View.IsExternalLoginOnly)
    {
        // we only have one option for logging in and it's an external provider
        return RedirectToPage("/ExternalLogin/Challenge", 
				new { scheme = View.ExternalLoginScheme, returnUrl });
    }

    if (View.UseShopClientDisplay)
    {
        return RedirectToPage("ShopClient", new { returnUrl });
    }
       
    return Page();
}
  


<p></p>



<p>The HTML part of the Razor Page uses a different Layout and the Layout is set explicitly in the Razor Page. </p>


  @page
@model IdentityProvider.Pages.Login.ShopClient
@{
    Layout = "Shared/_LayoutShopClient";
}
&lt;div class="login-page"&gt;
    &lt;div class="lead"&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Shop Client Login&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Choose how to login&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

  


<p></p>



<p>Different, options, styles and layouts can be setup for any clients.</p>







<p></p>



<p>Or a different client display using the ClientID as the switch:</p>







<p></p>



<p>With this setup any CSS and any layout can be used for the different clients. This is one way of having a multi-tenant or multiple client setup. This setup uses a different Client ID to style and add or remove options.</p>



 Notes 



<p>This works well and does not require much effort. Sometimes customization is required within a single client. If you intend to use this in a multiple tenant solution, you should disable the default sign-in screen if building from the ASP.NET Core Identity templates. In a follow up post, I will look at further customization within a single client option.</p>

<p><a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=2218">Kim Cameron</a> first told me what Digital Identity is on February 1, 2005.  He said that the Internet was created without an identity layer. He encouraged me “You should come help build it with me.” I’ve been at it ever since!</p>
<p><a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=1367">What I wrote about digital identity a decade ago</a> remains as true today:</p>
<blockquote><p>
An interesting thing about digital identity is that, by definition, it’s not a problem that any one company can solve, no matter how great their technology is.  For digital identity to be “solved”, the solution has to be broadly adopted, or else people will continue having different experiences at different sites and applications.  Solving digital identity requires ubiquitously adopted identity standards.  Part of the fun and the challenge is making that happen.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m not going to even try to list all the meaningful identity and security initiatives that I’ve had the privilege to work on with many of you.  But I can’t resist saying that, in my view, OpenID Connect, JSON Web Token (JWT), and OAuth 2.0 are the ones that we knocked out of the park.  I tried to distill the lessons learned from many of the initiatives, both successes and failures, during my 2023 EIC keynote <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=2345">Touchstones Along My Identity Journey</a>.  And there’s a fairly complete list of the consequential things I’ve gotten to work on in my <a href="https://self-issued.consulting/standards-cv">Standards CV</a>.</p>
<p>I’ll also call attention to 2025 marking twenty years of the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop</a>.  I attended the first one, which was held in Berkeley, California in October 2005, and all but one since.  What a cast of characters I met there, many of whom I continue working with to this day!</p>
<p>As a personal testament to the value of IIW, it’s where many of the foundational decisions about what became JWS, JWE, JWK, JWT, and OpenID Connect were made.  Particularly, see <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=361">my post documenting decisions made at IIW about JWS</a>, including the <code>header.payload.signature</code> representation of the JWS Compact Serialization and the decision to secure the Header Parameters.  And see the posts following it on <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=378">JWE decisions</a>, <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=386">naming decisions</a>, and <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=390">JWK decisions</a>.  IIW continues playing the role of enabling foundational discussions for emerging identity technologies today!</p>
<p>It’s been a privilege working with all of you for these two decades, and I love what we’ve accomplished together!  There’s plenty of consequential work under way and I’m really looking forward to what comes next.</p>

<p>The Pulse is <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/s/the-pulse">a series</a> covering insights, patterns, and trends within Big Tech and startups. Notice an interesting event or trend? <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/contact/">Send me a message</a>.</p><p>This week, a massive event shook the tech industry: a lesser-known Chinese AI lab shocked the markets and tech professionals with the DeepSeek AI model, which feels on a par with OpenAI’s most capable publicly available model, <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/">ChatGPT o1</a>. OpenAI has a more advanced o3 model, but it’s <a href="https://12daysofopenai.com/#day12">in preview</a> and isn’t publicly available yet. DeepSeek is released as open and free to use within the DeepSeek app, or for anyone to host and download it.</p><p>Major AI companies are coming to terms with the fact that a small team in China with supposedly little funding, and no access to NVIDIA’s latest AI chips, could pull this feat off. It shatters the image of OpenAI’s invincibility, the notion that the US leads the AI race, and also raises the question of whether open models will turn advanced LLMs into a commodity.</p><p>Today, we cover:</p>  <p>The first “thinking model” that feels fast – and is a hit</p>  <p>About 4x cheaper — and possibly more efficient? — than ChatGPT</p>  <p>Open model spreads fast</p>  <p>OpenAI’s need to remain fully closed highlighted by DeepSeek</p>  <p>How did DeepSeek do it, and why give it away for free?</p>  <p>Geopolitics and export controls</p>  <p>Google feared open source AI will win</p>   1. The first “thinking model” that feels fast – and is a hit <p>On Monday, NVIDIA’s valuation plummeted from $3.5 trillion to $2.9 trillion; an almost <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/27/nvidia-sheds-almost-600-billion-in-market-cap-biggest-drop-ever.html">$600B reduction</a> in its market cap on a 17% drop in the stock price. This was reported as the biggest ever fall by a U.S. company. The cause? A new Large Language Model (LLM) model called DeepSeek built by a Chinese AI startup, which has been an overnight sensation. Also on the same day, the DeepSeek app (built by the same company) <a href="https://x.com/AravSrinivas/status/1883687330101522908">hit the #1 spot</a> on the US App Store on both iOS and Android, making it more downloaded than ChatGPT, which was relegated to #2. DeepSeek has remained #1 since.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff0655152-512b-4e0c-b838-34556061f856_1600x645.png">          </a>Top iOS apps in the US. It’s rare for an app by a Chinese developer to hit top spot. DeepSeek is #1 on Android as well <p>What’s the cause of Deepseek’s sudden popularity? It’s thanks to the company updating the app to enable its “DeepThink (R1)” mode that uses their DeepSeek-R1 model. This model is similar to OpenAI’s o1 model in that it takes more ‘thinking time’ to respond, by using more compute to serve up a better response.</p><p>A big difference is that DeepSeek displays the model’s “chain of thought”, whereas OpenAI hides what happens during the “thinking” phase. So, the model feels much more “snappy” than OpenAI’s o1, more transparent, and more relatable. And frankly, it’s a far better experience to watch the model “think out loud” for 30 seconds, than watching ChatGPT’s spinner for 30 seconds.</p><p>Here’s a good example of what happens when asking a question that trips a lot of LLMs up: “if a chicken says ‘all chickens are liars’ is the chicken telling the truth?” DeepSeek starts to “think” for nearly a minute, spitting out pages-worth of internal monologue:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa02f9c83-6717-4e60-884d-1a4ac3431b1f_1600x954.png">          </a>DeepSeek shows its inner prompts while “thinking” up a response. It generated four times as much to answer the riddle I posed <p>In the end, the answer it generates concludes the question is a paradox. The output is pretty similar to what OpenAI’s o1 produces, except o1 takes around the same time (38 seconds) to “think” and doesn’t show anything to the user.</p><p>DeepSeek: free, OpenAI: $20-200/month. An obvious reason for the DeepSeek app’s popularity is that it’s free and offers virtually the same functionality as paid ChatGPT plans, which cost $20/month for limited access, and $200/month for unlimited access to the advanced o1 and o1-mini models. DeepSeek offers all of this for free, while somehow dealing with what look like enormous loads. The key to this is that DeepSeek seems to be an order of magnitude cheaper to operate than existing models, like OpenAI’s’.</p> 2. About 4x cheaper — and possibly more efficient? — than ChatGPT <p>The team behind DeepSeek found dozens of approaches to improve efficiency of their model – and <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2412.19437v1">published</a> these optimizations in a paper titled <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2412.19437v1">DeepSeek-V3 Technical Report</a>.

<p>As the new administration is playing stupid games, yesterday morning, prior to yesterday’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Potomac_River_mid-air_collision">aviation disaster</a>, professor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Schaller">Thomas Schaller</a> cautioned:

<blockquote>
  <p>An FAA employee I know confirms agency already lacks sufficient air traffic controllers. The so-called “buyouts” and other attacks on federal employees won’t help.  Remember that fact when the flight delays (crashes?) commence and Trumpers start falsely blaming DEI or Biden.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This should be a wakeup call and I have a deeper appreciation for people like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phyllis_Fong">Phyllis Fong</a> who this week have resisted the illegal orders that are already causing significant harm.  On the other hand, if you like anarchy and disaster, congratulations.</p>

<p>My first attempt at building a decentralized app in this day and age will use Solid Pods and DIDs. The goal? A super simple “BooksWeLike” app—a place where I can review books and see what my friends are reading and enjoying.</p><p><br></p><p>What makes this app different is how it handles data. Unlike traditional apps where data lives in a centralized database, my app will let users store their own data in Solid Pods. Think of a Pod as your own personal data vault—you control who can access it and how it’s used. And instead of relying on centralized logins like Google or Facebook, I’ll use Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), which allow users to prove their identity on their own terms.</p><p><br></p><p>The plan for the app is straightforward:</p><p>	•	If you already have a DID or a Solid Pod, you can sign in using your existing accounts.</p><p>	•	If you don’t, the app will help you create them when you sign up.</p><p><br></p><p>Of course, part of this journey is figuring out how practical and possible all of this really is. Beyond building the app, I’ll also evaluate the tools, SDKs, client libraries, and documentation available for Solid and DID developers. How well is the building community being enabled? I’ll compare my experience with other distributed ecosystems as I attempt to replicate this app in different environments in the future. Once the app exists across multiple ecosystems, I can explore broader topics like ecosystem interoperability and federation.</p><p><br></p><p>These technologies are still evolving, and I’m excited to explore what’s possible—and what needs improvement.</p><p><br></p><p>So, what about you? Have you already taken the plunge into the world of DIDs or Solid Pods? Or is this your first time hearing about them? Let’s find out together as I document this journey.</p><p><br></p><p>In my next post, I’ll dive into the nitty-gritty of authentication—getting users to log in with their DIDs and connecting them to their Pods. I suspect it’s trickier than it sounds, but that’s all part of the adventure.</p>

 <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F246271b1-6d0b-46cb-a296-88eeaca6699a_1792x1024.heic">          </a> <p>Security professionals have long taught that organizations should limit the access individuals have in computer systems to just those privileges necessary to perform their job. This is known as the principle of least privilege. The problem is that knowing this is a best practice and putting it into practice are two different things. Traditionally, organizations have used access control lists (ACLs) and role-based access control (RBAC) based on groups to authorize activities. These methods are static, requiring that lists or groups be updated manually as people move between roles or leave employment. When this is extended to partners, suppliers, and other services, the problem is that much worse. And excess standing privileges are a real security risk.</p><p>Standing privileges are characterized by persistent access regardless of whether the person is using the resource or not, predefined scope where role is used to define broad access, and minimal oversight with little monitoring and accountability. Standing privileges increase the attack surface, letting attackers exploit broad permissions without further escalation. In addition, over time people accumulate permissions beyond what they need to perform their current job, a situation known as privilege creep.</p><p>In an ideal world, least privilege is like a shrink wrap, constantly adjusting the access perimeter as the needs of the employee change. Sometimes they expand and the shrink wrap expands to seamlessly grant any access to needed perform a job. Sometimes the needs shrink and the access perimeter of the employee contracts as well. By limiting access to just that necessary to perform tasks, least privilege ensures that the attack surface that an attacker can exploit is as small as possible.</p> Zero Trust <p>Sometimes it's easy to get least privilege and zero trust confused. Zero trust is an overall security framework that requires continuous trust verification. Zero trust is a strategic, overarching trust model for an entire organization. Least privilege, in contrast, is more tactical, determining who can access what and when they can do it.</p><p>To see how least privilege fits into a zero trust strategy, consider a database administrator (DBA). Least privilege might set access controls such that the DBA can manage databases, but cannot view customer data stored within them. If their credentials are compromised, the attacker cannot steal sensitive information because the DBA’s privileges are tightly scoped. Zero trust relies on the DBA's access being valid, but might also check for unusual activity such that if the DBA appears to be accessing the database from a new location or at an unusual time, access is curtailed until the DBA is re-authenticated.</p><p>As the example shows, least privilege is an important part of zero trust, but only part. Other tactics that play in a zero trust strategy include device management, multi-factor authentication, and segmenting applications and processes (i.e., microsegmentation) to make fine-grained access control possible. Still, least privilege is a core part of a zero trust strategy. And least privilege depends on eliminating standing privileges.</p> Eliminating Standing Privileges <p>Recent developments in dynamic authorization have made it easier than ever to eliminate standing privileges. Standing privileges are the result when automatically updating an employee's access in response to changing circumstances is difficult. Modern policy-based authorization systems like <a href="https://www.cedarpolicy.com/en">Cedar</a> allow organizations to control access though policies that state who can access what and under what conditions. These policies are managed like code, making them easier to manage. More importantly, they can automatically respond to changing circumstances.</p><p>For example, the first of the following two Cedar policies forbids anyone to access any resource that's considered "critical" unless they're on a managed device with an acceptable security posture. The second permits employees in the Finance group to access any finance application. These policies work together, so that if the finance application is also a critical resource, then finance employees would also have to be on a managed device with an acceptable security posture. As employees change roles that group is automatically updated from the HR system, growing or shrinking access as needed.</p> <code>forbid(  
    principal,  
    action,  
    resource in Category::"CriticalResources"  
) unless {  
    context.device.security.risk == "Secure" &amp;&amp;  
    context.device.security.assessment.overall &gt;= 80  
};

permit(  
    principal in UserGroup::"Finance"  
    action,  
    resource in Category::"FinanceApplications"  
);  </code> <p>While policy-based access control (PBAC) can be used to mimic a role-based access control system, proper system segmentation (i.e. being able to identify finance applications) and device management allows finer-grained access control where employee's actions can be restricted to specific systems and only when their using a company-owned device that is properly secured. Access control can be limited to certain times or from specific locations. All of these reduce the surface area of an employee's access perimeter for better security.</p> Just-in-Time Access Control <p>We can shrink the access perimeter even further using just-in-time access control. Just-in-time (JIT) access control is a mechanism that grants users, applications, or processes access to resources only for a limited time and only when it is explicitly needed. This minimizes the risks associated with long-term or persistent access privileges. While the principle of least privilege focuses on ensuring users or systems have the minimum permissions required to perform their roles or tasks, JIT access control refines this further with several other important features:</p>  <p>Time-Bound Privileges:—JIT ensures permissions are time-limited, reducing the window of opportunity attackers have to exploit rarely-used accounts. For example, a developer needing access to a production server might receive elevated privileges only for a specific task and only for a set duration.</p>  <p>Dynamic Privilege Assignment:—Even when policies are evaluated for each access, the permissions they allow are available indefinitely. JIT adds another dimension to the dynamic nature of PBAC where privileges are granted on demand and revoked automatically when no longer needed.</p>  <p>Granular Control:—Dynamic privilege assignment complements PBAC by making access more granular—not just who can access what, but also when and for how long.</p>  <p>JIT access control might, for example, be used to limit access to payroll functions except during the window when payroll is being processed. Another example is in so-called "break-glass" situations where access is granted to production resources in an emergency or in the case of unexpected failure. Other examples use dynamic roles (e.g., on call) to grant access or require a third party (like a manager) to approve access.</p><p>These scenarios can fit within a policy-based authorization architecture using mechanisms such as dynamically altering roles or adding information to the authorization request context based on querying other systems or utilizing permission tokens that carry time-based permissions with them. For example, the following policy makes use of an assignment to process payroll in the oncall tracking system to ensure only people with an oncall assignment of "payroll" can process the payroll.</p> <code>forbid(  
    principal  
    action == "Payroll::Process",  
    resource  
) unless {  
    context.oncall.assignment == "payroll"  
} </code> <p>For this to work, the authorization agent that creates the request for the policy authorizer has to ensure that the context for the request includes the correct oncall assignment and oncall assignments need to be automated.</p> Putting it All Together <p>Zero trust, the principle of least privilege, and just-in-time access work together to create a comprehensive security framework.</p>  <p>Zero trust enables an overarching strategy that mandates systems, resources, and actions be designed such that it is possible to continuously verify every action.</p>  <p>Principle of Least Privilege forms the heart of the zero trust strategy, mandating authentication and authorization systems that can dynamically grant fine-grained access through policy.</p>  <p>Just-in-time authorization augments the authorization system so that permissions can be granted not just based on who and where, but also only when they are needed to perform critical actions.</p>  <p>The well known adage that you can't buy security, applies to zero trust and JIT. There are products and technologies that make just-in-time, dynamic fine-grained access control possible, but besides putting them in place, you must also integrate them, make any necessary changes to other systems, and implement governance, monitoring, and auditing to ensure they work. These are organizational changes that take time, money, and perseverance. Done right, the payoff is not just a reduced attack surface and better security, but more productive employees as well. This may seem counter-intuitive, but poorly implemented, piecemeal security measures put much of the burden for keeping systems safe on employees who deal with tactics like frequent, yet ineffective password changes or requesting, and then waiting for, permissions to do their job.</p><p>When dynamic access control with JIT access is thoughtfully implemented, you shift the burden of security from employees to systems that automate protection, making it proactive and intelligent. Reducing friction so that employees can do their job while also enhancing security requires balance and a holistic approach that aligns technology, process, and culture. This transformation requires real effort but offers substantial rewards: resilient, secure systems; empowered employees; and peace of mind.</p>   <p>Photo Credit: Shrink Wrapped Computers from DALL-E (public domain) Prompt: draw a wide format picture of several colorful, shrink wrapped computers and smartphones.</p>

<p>I took notes on Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz’s post-election discussion of their Fairshake pro-crypto Pac and the coming Trump presidency about two months ago, but set them aside and other topics took precedence. Given the rising craziness in the crypto space around the inauguration, I thought it was a good time to put them out for consideration. A quick glance at the finances of their pro-crypto / pro-blockchain Pac should be a wake up call to anyone doubting the rising tide of automated, smart contract law and global cyber governance. We need to wrap our heads around the fact that it’s less about money and power and more about information theory, token engineering, and the shift of social systems into a networked super intelligence operating under the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals for expanded “human potential.” It is a bipartisan effort. It is an international effort. It will be framed as a “populist uprising” to take back “the commons,” engineered of course by the world’s largest asset holders. In my opinion, meme-coins are biosemiotic aides facilitating emergent swarm intelligence. Tread carefully around those digital mind viruses folks. A lot of money, and tokens, are being thrown around trying to get their planned cyberphysical-sociotechnical future to stick.&nbsp;</p>

 ASP.NET Core user application access token management 



 <a href="https://damienbod.com/2025/02/10/asp-net-core-delegated-oauth-token-exchange-access-token-management/">ASP.NET Core delegated OAuth Token Exchange access token management</a> 
 



 Setup 



<p>The ASP.NET Core web application authenticates using OpenID Connect and OpenIddict as the secure token server. The application needs to use data from an app-to-app resource. An OAuth client credential flow is used to get an application access token to access the API. The OAuth client credentials flow can only be used when it can keep a secret. This token has nothing in common with the delegated access token from the user authentication. The application is persisted once for the application. An in-memory cache is used for this. The application sends the application access token as a bearer token to the API.</p>







<p></p>



 What must an application manage? 



<p>An access token management solution must ensure that tokens are securely stored per application for application tokens and updated after each UI authentication or refresh. The solution should be robust to handle token expiration, function seamlessly after restarts, and support multi-instance deployments. The tokens must be persisted safely in multiple instance setups. Additionally, it must effectively manage scenarios involving invalid or missing access tokens.</p>



 Properties of token management in the solution setup: 



 
 The access token is persisted per application 



 The token expires 



 The token needs to be persisted somewhere safely (Safe and encrypted storage if not in-memory) 



 The solution must work after restarts 



 The solution must work for multiple instances when deployed to multi-instance deployments. 



 The solution must handle invalid access tokens or missing access tokens 
 



 Implementation example  



<p>An ApplicationAccessTokenCache service is used to manage the access tokens for the application. The service is registered as a singleton and runs once for the whole application. Each request scope can use this. The application looks in the cache for a valid token and if no valid token is present, the service requests a new access token using the OAuth client credentials flow. The token is persisted to the cache using the client ID. This means only one token can exist per client definition.</p>

<p></p>



<p>The required services are added the the application in the program file. </p>


  builder.Services.AddSingleton&lt;ApplicationAccessTokenCache&gt;();
builder.Services.AddScoped&lt;ApplicationUsersService&gt;();
builder.Services.AddHttpClient();

builder.Services.AddDistributedMemoryCache();
  


<p></p>



<p>The token cache works great when using in-memory cache. If using a persistent cache, care needs to be taken that the access tokens are persisted in a safe way. </p>



 Notes 



<p>In follow up blogs, I will look at the different ways and the different types of strategies which are used to implement token management in ASP.NET Core web applications.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSaMF7KbUME">this morning’s video</a> I somehow missed the fact that the inauguration coincides with MLK Day, which is an interesting sync with the “melanin as optical material” lens. I’m going to drop a few links to old blog posts that touch on the YMCA and “out of school time learning” as as well as my “Momo” read-aloud playlist. Maybe I should do a read aloud of Bentov’s “Stalking the Wild Pendulum,” too? I’m understanding it much better now. Look for a discussion of quantum realism with Joseph Gonzales in the coming week. I’ll just say it once again, I can’t believe I have to talk about any of this, but if you don’t take it too seriously, conjecturing can be rather fun.</p>

<p>In this video I draw connections between Gestalt theory and organizational development as applied to digital groupthink in the context of Christiana Figueres, a leader in the development of carbon trading, who trained at the Gestalt Institute of Cleveland. As a young woman, she attended Swarthmore College, a Quaker institution. The first wife of her father, three-time president of Costa Rica and MIT alumnus, had ties to Quaker expats (Henrietta Boggs’ uncle and aunt) who emigrated south from Alabama in the 1950s. </p>
<p>Kenneth Boulding, a Quaker economist who developed some of the first ideas around social impact investing, and his wife Elise, sociologist who built the field of peace studies, were affiliated with Swarthmore though Kenneth only did a year’s stint as a guest lecturer. </p>
<p>When our family toured the campus for a college visit, it was made clear that only the top-tier candidates would be accepted, because many slots were reserved for equity outreach. Interestingly a high percentage of students presenting that day asserted their intentions to become economists with aspirations of working at the World Bank and the IMF. That was an eye-opener for sure!&nbsp;</p>

<p>I use the visual of the optical illusion of paired silhouettes with a vase in the center to describe how two narratives can be presented, but often only one is truly “seen.” This Gestalt concept is applied to parallel narratives – one presented in two recent stories on Unlimited Hangout that foreground militarism and data surveillance in AI healthcare and the story I keep attempting to tell about gamified managed community “wellness” protocols linked to social impact finance deals on blockchain that on another level will be leveraged to catalyze emergent behaviors and possibly advance bio-hybrid information processing.</p>
<p>I also describe a strange encounter in which Aetna health care intended to target low-income communities of color for VR guided meditation in a digital “jungle” setting. The second hour of the video is a repeat of two site visits Jason and made in Denver in 2022 to the then new Palantir headquarters and the state capitol.</p>

<p>The article looks at managing user delegated access tokens for a downstream API in an ASP.NET Core web application. There are many ways of implementing this, all with advantages and disadvantages. The tokens are requested from an OpenID Connect server using the recommended standards. In this blog, the UI access token from the application authentication is re-used for the downstream API.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/token-mgmt-ui-delegated-direct">https://github.com/damienbod/token-mgmt-ui-delegated-direct</a></p>

 <a href="https://damienbod.com/2025/02/10/asp-net-core-delegated-oauth-token-exchange-access-token-management/">ASP.NET Core delegated OAuth Token Exchange access token management</a> 
 



 Setup 



<p>The solution uses a secure downstream API and requires user delegated access tokens for access. The UI application is implemented using ASP.NET Core and razor pages. The UI application authenticates against an OpenID Connect server implemented using OpenIddict. The application client is implemented using an OpenID Connect confidential client and the OpenID Connect code flow with PKCE. This flow returns an access token which is used for the downstream API. </p>







<p></p>



 What must an application manage? 



<p>An access token management solution must ensure that tokens are securely stored per user session for user delegated tokens and updated after each UI authentication or refresh. The solution should be robust  to handle token expiration, function seamlessly after restarts, and support multi-instance deployments. Additionally, it must effectively manage scenarios involving invalid or missing access tokens.</p>



 Properties of token management in the solution setup: 



 
 The access token is persisted per user session 



 The token expires 



 The token needs to be persisted somewhere safely 



 The token must be replaced after each UI authentication (per user) 



 The solution must work after restarts 



 The solution must work for multiple instances when deployed to multi-instance deployments. 



 The solution must handle invalid access tokens or missing access tokens 
 



 Implementation example using Duende Token Management 



<p>The <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Duende.AccessTokenManagement.OpenIdConnect">Duende Token Management OpenIdConnect</a> Nuget package can be used to implement these requirements for user delegated access tokens. This is not the only way to do this and can be implemented in numerous different ways. With this package, the AddOpenIdConnectAccessTokenManagement can be used to add the token management. </p>


  builder.Services.AddOpenIdConnectAccessTokenManagement();
  


<p></p>



<p>The different HTTP requests or the Razor pages can use the GetUserAccessTokenAsync method to get the access token for each user and session. The SaveTokens is set to true to persist the tokens in the session using a secure cookie per default. This is an option in the AddOpenIdConnect method. The defined scope is used to select the access token.</p>


   // token expires, token managment required
var accessToken = await HttpContext.GetUserAccessTokenAsync(
   new UserTokenRequestParameters
   {
      Scope = "myscope"
   });
  


<p></p>



<p>The AddUserAccessTokenHttpClient method can be used to add a named HttpClient client for the access token and the specific API.</p>


  builder.Services.AddUserAccessTokenHttpClient("profileClient",
    configureClient: client =&gt; 
    { 
        client.BaseAddress = new Uri(profileApiBaseUrl!); 
    });
  


<p></p>



<p>This client can then be used to access the API resource using the access token.</p>


  var client = _clientFactory.CreateClient("profileClient");

var response = await client.GetAsync("api/Profiles/photo");
if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
{
    var data = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();

    if (data != null)
        return data;

    return string.Empty;
}
  


<p>When the applications are started, the access token can be used to request data from the downstream API.</p>



 Notes 



<p>In follow up blogs, I will look at the different ways and the different types of strategies which are used to implement token management in ASP.NET Core web applications.</p>

<p>What will come of large language models when they mirror unsettled psyches defined by religious hero complexes into the cloud? We do ourselves and future generations a profound disservice when we choose not to make time to comprehend and interrogate how emerging technologies and narrative flows are being deployed to steer psychological states individually and as holon-based collectives through socio-technical, cyberphysical systems and the tokenized attention economy. </p>
<p>I recognize that rather than being a victim of Substack mania once again, I was merely a reflection of another’s discomfort in the world, an obstacle that gave someone a useful anchor point to exert his will and express his agency, however uninformed and misguided. It’s not a good feeling, but an informative lesson nonetheless. </p>
<p>It’s time to wrap our heads around tokenized spirituality and organized religion. My gut tells me Texas is ground zero for integration of the Drucker-Buford metaverse church model with digital community currencies tied to “moral” markets and social impact “charity” in ATT smart cities designed for community “wellness.”&nbsp; </p>
<p>I don’t think AI should be approached as a digital intercessor for “divine” moral guidance.” I view, web3 systems as linguistic scaffolds quietly mapping the terrain of our souls. Once harvested, our somatic pyschological GPS coordinates can be used ad infinitum to play us like instruments in the coming LARPy animist musical of blockchained cloud minds to solve gnarly problems that can only be untangled by a network of diverse, distributed intelligences – with digital wallets.</p>
<p>Follow your heart, think clearly, and ground yourself. It is easy to get swept away by the Sturm und Drang we generate around ourselves to make the hero roles we inhabit make sense. I’m not going to link to Andrew Corner’s Substack directly, but it’s not hard to find – I’m in the “energy” one. If you go there, fair warning, it’s a slog that’s equal parts disturbing and amusing. </p>
<p>What are we becoming folks? I don’t think the “hybrid” intelligence program is going to be a good look for many of us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>At the end of the day this may very well have simply been another signals-intelligence operation. It doesn’t seem like anyone really pays attention to that Substack anyway. If so, I hope there are at least a few useful take aways regarding how we should engage with this systems.</p>

 Part 2: Issuing&nbsp;Badges <p>In <a href="https://blog.dcconsortium.org/explaining-verifiable-credentials-and-open-badges-3-0-5bf2f482b383">part one</a> of this series, we discussed how the trust model of Open Badges 3.0 differs from earlier versions. Credentials issued as Open Badges 3.0 are based on the <a href="https://wiki.dcconsortium.org/app/page/1b808YBAgwQgD8omWIWcyUb193SW2MvG3Fs5XCX7wHyE?p=1h1VJHHv2zSe0n9Ltg-KQevSuqWbGcExy">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a> data model which describes how claims made online can be&nbsp;proven.</p><p>To explore this trust model, let’s explore the story of Olivia who has been taking classes at a local community college. Olivia is told that with each course she will be awarded and issued a badge that she can use to apply for employment.</p><p>Let’s start with what “issuing a badge” means using the most common approaches:</p><p>For older Open Badges (versions 0.5 to 2.1): The issuer saves completed course data in the format of an Open Badge that includes Olivia’s email address. When the issuer saves the data, the badge is considered “issued”. This data will be used to populate a web page or a file on the web. This web page or file must be public for Olivia to share online and be considered verifiable. In order for Olivia to do this, she must have an account on the issuing platform associated with the same email&nbsp;address.</p><p>For Open Badges 3.0 &amp; W3C Verifiable Credentials: The issuer decides that Olivia should be awarded a badge and provides a secure link for Olivia to retrieve it. Olivia uses a digital wallet to click the secure link which makes a request to the issuing software to produce the badge. The issuing software retrieves and digitally signs the badge data; at this moment the badge has been by definition “issued.” (Prior to this digital signature, the badge itself did not exist.) It is sent to Olivia’s wallet where she claims and secures it, now able to share it privately at her discretion. It is important to note that this credential is hosted locally on Olivia’s device. There is no web page or URL for this credential until Olivia decides to create a public&nbsp;link.</p> Different Trust&nbsp;Models   Older Open Badges are hosted on the web. In this model, trust in the credential is based on the reputation of the badging platform hosting the credentials. Perceptions of trust of websites or platforms can be based on elements like issuer identity confirmation, availability of content, and security of the web site (<a href="https://www.digicert.com/how-tls-ssl-certificates-work">how websites are secured</a>).  Open Badges 3.0 and Verifiable Credentials are digitally signed, portable files. In this model, trust is based on the cryptographic digital signature and privacy. The digital signature in the credential is readable to the verification software, which looks for information indicating which entity signed the credential and if the data has changed since it was signed. Confirmation of the issuing entity’s identity happens later using an issuer registry (to be explained in more detail in a future&nbsp;post).  <p>Olivia has unfettered access to the credential and can share it knowing that when she does, her actions aren’t being tracked or communicated to the issuer. When she shares her credential, it is signed by the digital identity associated with the credential issuer so that the verifier can trust that she has control of the digital identity and the credential.</p><p>It’s worth noting that Open Badges v3 and Verifiable Credential issuing platforms could still have public web pages for badges. Olivia may not want all of her badges digitally signed but with Open Badges 3.0 and Verifiable Credentials, she has that&nbsp;choice.</p><p>This blog post is Part 2 of a series of content explaining W3C Verifiable Credentials and Open Badges 3.0. Stay tuned for Part 3 — “What does it mean that a badge is digitally signed?”.</p><p>For more information on the DCC, including membership, projects, and events, visit our <a href="http://digitalcredentials.mit.edu/">website</a>, <a href="https://wiki.dcconsortium.org/">wiki</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/dccconsortium">Linkedin</a>.

<p>Is blogging still a thing?</p><p>If you’re reading this, please comment or like it so I know.</p><p><br></p><p>I am, at heart, still the XDI Guy. My passion for robust, secure, and scalable distributed data management hasn’t waned. Building one of the first XDI implementations (shout-out to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/markus-sabadello-353a0821/">Markus Sabadello</a>, who might have built the only other one), I learned a lot about the challenges and opportunities of distributed data at scale. Over the years, I’ve reflected on qualities essential for data ecosystems, qualities that are often overshadowed by content-driven ecosystems. For example:</p><p>	•	Caching semantics: Apps need governance and management of caches to respect data ownership while maintaining local operational efficiency.</p><p>	•	Transactionality: Mature data protocols depend on it for consistency and reliability.</p><p>	•	Request batching: Optimizing network requests is vital for performance and scalability.</p><p><br></p><p>After years away, I’m ready to dive back in. There are a couple of apps I want to build, and I want to build them on a distributed data platform. My first idea is a fully distributed implementation of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brad-degraf-4521/">Brad deGraf</a>’s BooksWeLike concept—a way to share and discover books that resonate with you. (Brad, if you’re reading this and don’t like the idea, let me know!)</p><p><br></p><p>To make this happen, I’ve started scanning the distributed protocol space to see what’s out there. Here’s my initial list of protocols to evaluate:</p><p>	•	AT Protocol</p><p>	•	Nostr</p><p>	•	Solid</p><p>	•	ActivityPub</p><p>	•	Matrix</p><p>	•	IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)</p><p>	•	SSB (Secure Scuttlebutt)</p><p>	•	DID (Decentralized Identifiers)</p><p>	•	Libp2p</p><p>	•	Hypercore</p><p>	•	Waku</p><p>	•	Zero-Knowledge Identity Protocols (ZK Protocols)</p><p><br></p><p>What am I missing?</p><p>Are there protocols on this list that don’t belong? If so, why? Are there others I should consider? I haven’t started my evaluations yet, so I’m open to your insights. If you’ve built apps on these protocols or have opinions about them, I’d love to hear from you.</p><p><br></p><p>I’ll be capturing my journey of discovery here—sharing what I learn, where I stumble, and how I (hopefully) succeed. Let’s make distributed data a reality, by and for the people.</p>

These advantages make our scheme a promising candidate for privacy-preserving digital identity applications.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>当社のECDSAの証明書は60ミリ秒で生成できます。ISO MDOC標準のような完全に標準化されたアイデンティティプロトコルに組み込まれた場合、クレデンシャルのサイズにもよりますが、モバイルデバイス上でMDOCプレゼンテーションフロー用のゼロ知識証明書を1.2秒で生成できます。これらの利点により、当社の方式はプライバシー保護型デジタルアイデンティティアプリケーションの有望な候補となっています。</p></blockquote><p>mdocのプレゼンテーション時にゼロ知識証明を1.2秒で生成、このくらいなら実用性がありそうですね。</p><p>論文の本文もPDFで閲覧できるようになっているので、おいおい見ていこうと思います。</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><br></p>

<p>In this post, I cover using LlamaIndex LlamaParse in auto mode to parse a PDF page containing a table, using a Hugging Face local embedding model, and using local Llama 3.1 8b via Ollama to perform naive Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). That’s a mouthful. I won’t go into how to setup Ollama and Llama 3.1 8b; this post assumes it is&nbsp;running.</p><p>First off, you can find the code for this in my <a href="https://github.com/manicprogrammer/LlamaIndex_Test">LlamaIndex_Test Github repo</a> under Test1/src folder. At the time of this writing there is a Test0 and a Test1. To see the post about Test0 code see <a href="https://medium.com/@m-ruminer/using-llamaindex-part-1-openai-e96b3efa699a">Using LlamaIndex — Part 1&nbsp;OpenAI</a>.</p><p>The code uses a&nbsp;.env and load_dotenv() to populate the needed LLAMA_CLOUD_API_KEY. I recommend that if you have an OPENAI_API_KEY entry in the&nbsp;.env that you comment it out for this experiment to prove to yourself that the embedding and LLM are local and not OpenAI. See the part 1 post for more details on the LLAMA_CLOUD_API_KEY.</p> #OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY<br>LLAMA_CLOUD_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY <p>The pip install dependencies I put as comments at the top of the python file. There is also a requirements.txt for the project as a whole that covers all the “Test” experiments package requirements.</p> # pip install llama-index-embeddings-huggingface<br># pip install llama-index-llms-ollama<br># pip install llama-index-core llama-parse llama-index-readers-file <p>The nice thing about LlamaIndex LlamaParse is that it provides an auto mode that will use premium mode when specified criteria are met. In this experiment, I have set auto mode on with triggers for mode change on in- page images or tables. Also, to save on parsing credit usage in LlamaParse and because, for this example, it is all that is needed, I have set the pages to be parsed to PDF page 9 only (note that PDF page 9 is target page 8 to LlamaParse because it uses a 0 based page index). Like the part 1 post, I am using an output of markdown because it provides greater context to the LLM; though, I did try it with result_type=text and received the proper query response despite the answer to the query being in a&nbsp;table.</p> # set LlamaParse for markdown output and auto_mode only parsing page 8<br>parser = LlamaParse(<br>    result_type="markdown", <br>    auto_mode=True,<br>    auto_mode_trigger_on_image_in_page=True,<br>    auto_mode_trigger_on_table_in_page=True,<br>    target_pages="8",<br>    verbose=True<br>) <p>So that you don’t have to open the PDF document that gets parsed to understand the input below is a screenshot of the&nbsp;page.</p><p>As in part 1, I use LlamaParse.load_data to read the page and parse it. Since it has a table in-page and we are in auto mode it will automatically use Premium mode to potentially better handle the page and table. This will cause the page parse to cost 15 credits on LlamaIndex. Note that LlamaIndex will cache your parsed page for 48 hours unless you specify otherwise or change the parse parameters which allows you to run the code more than once and only get the credit cost once. I did try using the default “accurate” mode by removing the auto_mode parameters on the LlamaParse and it still parsed the table properly and returned the proper answer to the query — but this is a sample for showing the use of “auto mode” so just pretend that is not the&nbsp;case.</p><p>If you want to see the output of the parser, uncomment the print command after the documents variable is populated. I like to then paste it into a markdown viewer to see it as rendered markdown output. See the below image for that&nbsp;output.</p> with open(f"../../sample_docs/{file_name}", "rb") as file_to_parse:<br>    # LlamaParse will cache a parsed document 48 hours if the parse parameters are not changed<br>    # thus not incuring additional parse cost if you run this multiple times for testing purposes<br>    # see the history tab in the LlamaParse dashboard for the project to confirm that <br>    # credits used = 0 for subsequent runs<br>    # <br>    # must provide extra_info with file_name key when passing file object<br>    documents = parser.load_data(file_to_parse, extra_info=extra_info)<br>    # to manually check the output uncomment the below<br>    #print(documents[0].text) <p>I like to set the default settings for LLM and embedding model so that I don’t need to pass them around as parameters. Here is where I set the embedding model to a Hugging Face provided model. When you run the python for the first time it will pull down the embedding model automatically — nice!</p> # set the default embeddings and llm so that it doesn't have to be passed around<br>Settings.embed_model = HuggingFaceEmbedding(model_name="BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5")<br>Settings.llm = Ollama(model="llama3.1:latest", request_timeout=120.0) <p>The next part of the code does the same that it did in Part 1 except that this time the VectoreStoreIndex and the query engine use the models I set in the Settings singleton versus the LlamaIndex default of&nbsp;OpenAI.</p> # index the parsed documents using the default embedding model<br>index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents)<br><br># generate a query engine for the index using the default llm<br>query_engine = index.as_query_engine()<br><br># provide the query and output the results<br>query = "What is the latency in seconds for Nova Micro?"<br>response = query_engine.query(query)<br>print(response) <p>If all goes well you should get the response output as 0.5 and if you look back at the table from the page you’ll see that is&nbsp;correct.</p> (.venv) PS C:\python\LlamaIndex_Test\Test1\src&gt; python parse_ollama.py<br>Started parsing the file under job_id 37dce328-aaa7-499b-afe9-498c32b63944<br>.0.5 <p>To validate that the value was coming from the RAG provided PDF page and not the the LLMs inherent “knowledge”, I asked a similar question via the command line to Ollama without providing the RAG context— output&nbsp;below:</p> PS C:\temp&gt; ollama run llama3.1:latest "what is the latency in seconds for Nova Micro Amazon LLM model?"<br>I don't have access to specific information about the latency of the Nova Micro Amazon LLM (Large Language Model)<br>model. The details regarding models like this, especially concerning their performance metrics such as latency,<br>are typically available from the developers or through official documentation and may be subject to change. If<br>you're looking for accurate and up-to-date information on this topic, I recommend checking directly with Nova<br>Micro's resources or contacting them for the most current data. <p>There you have it. But I am not done quite yet in reporting my results. In LlamaIndex’s examples, they used this PDF but used PDF page 1 which contains an image. See below an image of the&nbsp;page.</p><p>They use this page to demonstrate how LlamaParse in auto mode moves into premium mode for the page parsing because of the image and then creates a mermaid diagram from the image because it recognizes the image is of a diagram. Below is what they report as the outcome in&nbsp;part.</p> # The Amazon Nova Family of Models:<br># Technical Report and Model Card<br><br>Amazon Artificial General Intelligence<br><br>```mermaid<br>graph TD<br>    A[Text] --&gt; B[Nova Lite]<br>    C[Image] --&gt; B<br>    D[Video] --&gt; E[Nova Pro]<br>    F[Code] --&gt; E<br>    G[Docs] --&gt; E<br>    B --&gt; H[Text]<br>    B --&gt; I[Code]<br>    E --&gt; H<br>    E --&gt; I<br>    J[Text] --&gt; K[Nova Micro]<br>    L[Code] --&gt; K<br>    K --&gt; M[Text]<br>    K --&gt; N[Code]<br>    O[Text] --&gt; P[Nova Canvas]<br>    Q[Image] --&gt; P<br>    P --&gt; R[Image]<br>    S[Text] --&gt; T[Nova Reel]<br>    U[Image] --&gt; T<br>    T --&gt; V[Video]<br>    <br>    style B fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px<br>    style E fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px<br>    style K fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px<br>    style P fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px<br>    style T fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px<br>    <br>    classDef input fill:#lightblue,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px;<br>    class A,C,D,F,G,J,L,O,Q,S,U input;<br>    <br>    classDef output fill:#lightgreen,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px;<br>    class H,I,M,N,R,V output;<br>```<br><br>Figure 1: The Amazon Nova family of models <p>When I tried this I did not get the same outcome from the parse.

Over a three-week period, hackers stole 40 million credit and debit card accounts from retail giant Target by exploiting the account of an HVAC contractor. The attack began with an email-based phishing scam that tricked an employee at the HVAC company into revealing their credentials. As a vendor to Target, the HVAC company had legitimate access to Target’s systems. Using the stolen credentials, the hackers infiltrated Target’s network and installed malware on the retailer’s point-of-sale systems, enabling them to collect customer data. The breach resulted in direct costs to Target of nearly $300 million, along with reputational damage that is difficult to quantify.1</p><p>The Target breach underscores the critical importance of not only knowing who is accessing your systems (authentication) but also controlling what they can access (authorization). The HVAC vendor had access to Target’s systems for electronic billing, contract submission, and project management. However, the hackers were able to extend this access beyond those legitimate uses to reach systems used to update point-of-sale devices. Target’s failure to properly restrict access to critical systems created a significant vulnerability that the hackers exploited.</p><p>But I don’t want you to get the idea that authorization is just about securing IT systems—it’s also fundamental to how modern cloud applications function, enabling features that wouldn’t be possible otherwise. For example, services like Google Docs and Dropbox rely on authorization to allow users to share documents with specific people while restricting access to others. Without this capability, these applications would not be possible.</p><p>Another example is Amazon Web Services (AWS), where authorization enables Amazon to securely provide hundreds of cloud services to millions of customers at scale in a cost-effective manner. As a global distributed system taking advantage of multi tenancy to service millions of customers, AWS uses a sophisticated policy-based authorization system to help customers control access to the services running inside their accounts.</p><p>Several trends make authorization a more important topic that it has been:</p>  <p>More and more software is being delivered as a service (so called Software as a Service, or SaaS). As we’ve discussed cloud-based services can’t provide the needed levels of functionality and security without strong authorization systems.</p>  <p>Perimeter-based security architectures like firewalls are giving way to zero-trust architectures. Rather than assuming everyone inside the perimeter is trusted, zero-trust systems assume breach and authorize every access. This isn’t possible without flexible authorization systems that can determine whether to grant access based on the context of the request.</p>  <p>Internet of Things (IoT) and interconnected devices mean that more and more computer systems are talking to each other on their owner’s behalf. Restricting their access to the role they play protects them and prevents them from becoming a vector that hackers can exploit to break into other sensitive systems.</p>  <p>Regulatory compliance is yet another reason why authorization is increasingly important. Laws like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) require that access to personal information be carefully controlled so that only the right people and systems can use it. Beyond controlling access, these laws also require that you be able to audit access to show compliance.</p>  <p>In addition to these, the rise of GenAI and particularly AI agents that can act on your behalf pour gasoline on the smoldering identity industry interest in authorization. Am I talking to a human? Does this agent have authority to make a doctor's appointment on the patient's behalf? These and other questions mean that making good authorization decisions, knowing what decisions were made, and easily incorporating authorization infrastructure into your apps and infrastructure is vital.</p>    Notes   <p>The story is interesting beyond the fact that it highlights the need to properly manage access. Target’s response, or rather lack of one, provides several important security lessons: <a href="https://coverlink.com/cyber-liability-insurance/target-data-breach/">Cyber Case Study: Target Data Breach</a> provides more details</p>  <p>Photo Credit: Hacker Stealing Credit Cards from DALL-E (public domain).

<p>Released yesterday: <a href="https://sqitch.org" title="Sqitch: Sensible database change management">Sqitch</a> v1.5.0. This version the MySQL driver
<a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/DBD::mysql" title="DBD::mysql - MySQL driver for the Perl5 Database Interface (DBI)">DBD::mysql</a> with <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/DBD::MariaDB" title="DBD::MariaDB - MariaDB and MySQL driver for the Perl5 Database Interface (DBI)">DBD::MariaDB</a>, both for its better backward compatibility
with MySQL as well as MariaDB driver libraries and for its improved Unicode
handling. The <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/sqitch/sqitch">Docker image</a> likewise switched to the MariaDB <code>mysql</code>
client. I expect no compatibility issues, but you never know! Please file an
<a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/sqitch/issues" title="Sqitch Issues">issue</a> should you find any.</p>
<p>V1.5.0 also features a fixes for Yugabyte deployment, Oracle error handling,
existing Snowflake schemas, connecting to MySQL/MariaDB without a database
name, and omitting the <code>checkit</code> MySQL/MariaDB function when the Sqitch user

 Using LlamaIndex Part 1 — OpenAI <p>I have started to experiment with <a href="https://www.llamaindex.ai/">LlamaIndex</a> for use in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) document parsing and indexing. My results were mixed on the simple page provided. This is part 1, where I make a short post on LlamaIndex with OpenAI as the LLM component. I expect part 2 to be LlamaIndex with Ollama and Llama3–8b as the LLM components.</p><p>This is a very short chunk of code. I also used the LlamaIndex Parse browser-based tool to see if I received different outputs. As one would expect, I did not. You can access the browser-based tool by opening a LlamaIndex account and choosing the “Parse” tool in your dashboard. You’ll need an account if you plan to use the code I provide and you will also need to generate an API key from your LlamaIndex dashboard. One of the great things about LlamaIndex is that for a paid tool it is generous in its free usage; 1000 credits PER DAY. In “accurate” mode, it is 1 credit per page; in “premium” mode, it is 15 credits per page. For my simple one page example the output between the two did not&nbsp;differ.</p><p>First the small snippet of&nbsp;code.</p> # pip install llama-index-embeddings-openai llama-index-llms-openai<br># pip install llama-index-core llama-parse llama-index-readers-file<br><br>from llama_parse import LlamaParse<br>from llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex<br>from dotenv import load_dotenv<br><br><br>load_dotenv()<br><br>parser = LlamaParse(result_type="markdown", verbose=True)<br><br>file_name = "ssi-page-5.pdf"<br>extra_info = {"file_name": file_name}<br><br>with open(f"../../sample_docs/{file_name}", "rb") as file_to_parse:<br>    # must provide extra_info with file_name key when passing file object<br>    documents = parser.load_data(file_to_parse, extra_info=extra_info)<br>    # to manually check the MD output uncomment the below<br>    # print(documents[0].text)<br><br># index the parsed documents<br>index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents)<br><br># generate a query engine for the index<br>query_engine = index.as_query_engine()<br><br># provide the query and output the results<br>query = "what are the principles of SSI?"<br>response = query_engine.query(query)<br>print(response) <p>You can find this code and a few sample documents, including the document used in this code in my <a href="https://github.com/manicprogrammer/LlamaIndex_Test">LlamaIndex_Test</a> Github repo with the code specifically under the Test0&nbsp;folder.</p><p>Note that I don’t set an LLM or an embedding model. LlamaIndex uses OpenAI as the default LLM and OpenAI’s text-embedding-ada-002. You will need an OpenAI API key to go along with the LlamaIndex key. My code loads them from the&nbsp;.env to environmental variables and if they are named appropriately those variables will be found by default. Below is a&nbsp;.env&nbsp;example.</p> OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY<br>LLAMA_CLOUD_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY <p>In the code above I am using a single-page PDF, “ssi-page-5.pdf”. It is page 5 of the larger document, “Self-Sovereign Identity A Systematic Review Mapping and Taxonomy.pdf”. If you plan to send LlamaParse a larger document but use the API properties to tell it only to parse a subset of pages from the document keep in mind that LlamaParse starts at page 0. The first time I tried this I had an off-by-one issue because I assumed page 1 of the document was, you know, page 1. It was page 0. This is understandable from a programming standpoint but caught me off guard&nbsp;anyway.</p><p>In the example code, I opened a file directly but LlamaIndex provides a directory reader with filters, if you desire to use that instead. The results I got back on the LLM query were spot on as would be expected on a single page of context with a well-outlined section pertinent to my simple&nbsp;query.</p><p>You don’t really need the creation of the vector index, query engine and query/response to test out LlamaIndex parsing. Just uncomment line 23 in the above code (line 19 in the repo code) comment out everything below it and get the parsed&nbsp;output.</p> Premium Mode and Auto Mode and Less than Expected&nbsp;Outcomes <p>In the code, I didn’t try out premium mode or auto mode. I intend to make a separate post about auto mode. I did try them in the LlamaIndex Parse tool. In both, I expected the image at the top of the page to get output as an image in the “Images” tab of the Parse output tool, but it&nbsp;didn’t.</p><p>The image at the top of the page is below as a screen&nbsp;capture.</p><p>This was disappointing. I’m not sure why this did not provide the expected&nbsp;outcome.</p><p>There you have it. A simple bit of code to parse using LlamaIndex. What makes it different from other parsers I have tried (all open source) is that it spits out the results in markdown, if desired, which is better than the usual plain text I received in other tools. The markdown provides the LLM more context even if in my simple case it was not of value. The other is that in theory, it will better parse images, tables etc., but as I explained I did not get that result.&nbsp;:-( I’ll continue to experiment with it, especially on more complicated pages such as ones that contain a table and in auto mode via&nbsp;code.</p><p>You can find part 2 as “<a href="https://medium.com/@m-ruminer/ai-rag-with-llamaindex-local-embedding-and-ollama-llama-3-1-8b-b0620116a715">AI RAG with LlamaIndex, Local Embedding, and Ollama Llama 3.1 8b</a>”. The example in part 2 uses LlamaParse auto&nbsp;mode.</p>

  The W3C Verifiable Credentials Working Group published the Snapshot Second Candidate Recommendation of the Securing Verifiable Credentials using JOSE and COSE specification just before the holidays.

<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/"></a>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/vc/">W3C Verifiable Credentials Working Group</a> published the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2024/CR-vc-jose-cose-20241219/">Snapshot Second Candidate Recommendation of the Securing Verifiable Credentials using JOSE and COSE specification</a> just before the holidays.  This was one of <a href="https://www.w3.org/news/2024/five-candidate-recommendation-snapshots-published-by-the-verifiable-credentials-working-group/">five Candidate Recommendation Snapshots</a> published by the working group at the same time, including for the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2024/CR-vc-data-model-2.0-20241219/">Verifiable Credentials Data Model 2.0</a>, which I’m also an editor of.  A <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#candidate-recommendation-snapshot">W3C Candidate Recommendation Snapshot</a> is intended to become a <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#RecsCR">W3C Candidate Recommendation</a> after required review and approval steps.</p>
<p><a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=2525">As I wrote about the First Candidate Recommendation</a>, VC-JOSE-COSE secures VC Data Model payloads with <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7515.html">JOSE</a>, <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/">SD-JWT</a>, or <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9052.html">COSE</a> signatures.  And while I’m admittedly not a fan of JSON-LD, to the extent that Verifiable Credentials using the JSON-LD-based VC Data Model are in use, I’m committed to there being a solid VC-JOSE-COSE specification so there is a simple, secure, standards-based way to sign these credentials.</p>
<p>One significant change since the First Candidate Recommendation was splitting the Controller Document text out into its own specification called <a href="https://w3c.github.io/cid/">Controlled Identifier Document 1.0</a>.  Publishing a Candidate Recommendation Snapshot for it is planned for next week.  Part of why it became its own specification is so that it can be referenced by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2024/04/did-wg-charter.html">planned update to the W3C DID specification</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to my co-editor <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cohengabe/">Gabe Cohen</a> and working group chair <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bzundel/">Brent Zundel</a> for the significant work they both put in to help us reach this point!</p>

found a <a href="https://blogs.perl.org/users/grinnz/2023/12/migrating-from-dbdmysql-to-dbdmariadb.html">blogs.perl.org post</a> highlighting some Unicode fixes in
DBD::MariaDB, as well.</p>
<p>Now, Sqitch likely doesn’t have the Unicode issue (it always works with Perl
Unicode strings), but it depends on <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/URI::db">URI::db</a> to provide the DBI connection
string. For MySQL URIs, the <a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/URI-db/source/lib/URI/mysql.pm#L6">URI::mysql dbi_driver</a> method returns <code>mysql</code>.</p>
<p>Should it be changed to return <code>MariaDB</code>, instead? Is there general
community consensus that DBD::MariaDB provides better compatibility with
both MySQL and MariaDB these days?</p>
<p>I’m also curious what the impact of this change would be for Sqitch.
Presumably, if DBD::MariaDB can build against either the MariaDB or MySQL
client library, it is the more flexible choice to continue supporting both
databases going forward.</p>

<p>Happy New Year! 🎉🥳🍾🥂</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9535.html" title="RFC 9535 JSONPath: Query Expressions for JSON">JSONPath RFC</a> includes a section on defining <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9535#name-normalized-paths" title="RFC 9535 JSONPath: Normalized Paths">normalized paths</a>,
which use a subset of JSONPath syntax to define paths to the location of a
node in a JSON value. I hadn’t thought much about it, but noticed that the
<a href="https://serdejsonpath.live">serde JSONPath Sandbox</a> provides a “Located” switch adds them to query
results. For the sake of complementarity, I added the same feature to the <a href="https://theory.github.io/jsonpath/">Go
JSONPath Playground</a>.</p>

</code>  <p><a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/theory/jsonpath@v0.3.0">v0.3.0</a> of the <code>github.com/theory/jsonpath</code> Go package enables this feature
via its new <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/theory/jsonpath@v0.3.0#Path.SelectLocated"><code>SelectLocated</code></a> method, which returns a <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/theory/jsonpath@v0.3.0#LocatedNodeList"><code>LocatedNodeList</code></a> that
shows off a few of the benfits of pairing JSONPath query results with paths
that uniquely identify their locations in a JSON value, including sorting and
deduplication. It also takes advantage of <a href="https://go.dev/blog/range-functions">Go v1.23 iterators</a>, providing
methods to range over all the results, just the node values, and just the
paths. As a result, v0.3.0 now requires Go 1.23.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://crates.io/crates/serde_json_path">serde_json_path Rust crate</a> inspired the use of <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/theory/jsonpath@v0.3.0#LocatedNodeList"><code>LocatedNodeList</code></a>
rather than a simple slice of <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/theory/jsonpath@v0.3.0/spec#LocatedNode"><code>LocatedNode</code></a> structs, but I truly embraced it
once I noticed the the focus on “nodelists” in the <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9535#name-overview" title="RFC 9535 JSONPath: Overview">RFC’s overview</a>, which
provides this definition:</p>
  
    <blockquote>
      <p>A JSONPath expression is a string that, when applied to a JSON value (the
query argument), selects zero or more nodes of the argument and outputs
these nodes as a nodelist.</p>
    </blockquote>
  
<p>It regularly refers to nodelists thereafter, and it seemed useful to have an
object to which more features can be added in the future.
<code>github.com/theory/jsonpath</code> <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/theory/jsonpath@v0.3.0">v0.3.0</a> thererfore also changes the result value
of <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/theory/jsonpath@v0.3.0#Path.Select"><code>Select</code></a> from <code>[]any</code> to the new <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/theory/jsonpath@v0.3.0#NodeList"><code>NodeList</code></a> struct, an alias for
<code>[]any</code>. For now it adds a single method, <code>All</code>, which again relies on <a href="https://go.dev/blog/range-functions">Go
v1.23 iterators</a> to iterate over selected nodes.</p>
<p>While the data type has changed, usage otherwise has not. One can iterate
directly over values just as before:</p>
  <code>for _, val := range path.Select(jsonInput) {
    fmt.Printf("%v\n", val)
}
</code>  <p>But <code>All</code> removes the need to alias-away the index value with <code>_</code>:</p>
  <code>for val := range path.Select(jsonInput).All() {
    fmt.Printf("%v\n", val)
}
</code>  <p>I don’t expect any further incompatible changes to the main <code>jsonpath</code> module,
but adding these return values now allows new features to be added to the
selected node lists in the future.</p>
<p>May you find it useful!</p>

<p>Based on the recently-released Go <a href="https://theory.github.io/jsonpath/" title="Go JSONPath Playground">JSONPath</a> and <a href="https://theory.github.io/jsontree/" title="Go JSONTree Playground">JSONTree</a> playgrounds, I’ve
updated the design and of the <a href="https://theory.github.io/sqljson/" title="Go SQL/JSON Playground">SQL/JSON Playground</a>. It now comes
populated with sample JSON borrowed from <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9535.html" title="RFC 9535 JSONPath: Query Expressions for JSON">RFC 9535</a>, as well as a selection of
queries that randomly populate the query field on each reload. I believe this
makes the playground nicer to start using, not to mention more pleasing to the
eye.</p>
<p>The playground has also been updated to use the recently-released
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/theory/sqljson@v0.2.1/path">sqljson/path v0.2 package</a>, which replicates a few changes included in the
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/postgresql-17-released-2936/" title="PostgreSQL 17 Released!">PostgreSQL 17 release</a>. Notably, the <code>.string()</code> function no longer uses a
time zone or variable format to for dates and times.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

 Wenn du gesetzlich krankenversichert bist, wird deine Krankenkasse bis 15. Januar 2025 eine elektronische Patientenakte für dich einrichten – es sei denn, du widersprichst. Das gilt auch für private Krankenversicherungen, die freiwillig eine elektronische Patientenakte anbieten. Durch einen Widerspruch dürfen dir keine Nachteile entstehen. Die Anschreiben der Krankenkassen informieren <a href="https://www.vzbv.de/pressemitteilungen/elektronische-patientenakte-krankenkassen-informieren-unzureichend">unzureichend</a>. Bedenke bei deiner Entscheidung: 



<p></p>



 
 
<p>1. Inhalt und Datensicherheit: Ohne deinen Widerspruch wird künftig jeder Arztbesuch, jede Therapie und jede Medikation in einer zentral abrufbaren elektronischen Patientenakte gespeichert, darunter Arztbriefe, Entlassungsberichte und Diagnosekennungen. Hierunter fallen unter anderem auch Informationen zu deinen Suchtkrankheiten, Psychotherapien und psychischen Erkrankungen, Schwangerschaftsabbrüchen, Geschlechtskrankheiten und Reproduktionsstörungen (z.B. Impotenz), die gespeichert und zusammengetragen werden.&nbsp;Durch die zentrale Speicherung aller Behandlungen in einer elektronischen Patientenakte erhältst du eine einheitliche Zugriffsmöglichkeit auf deine Patientendaten. Andererseits waren in der Vergangenheit bereits mehrere zentralisierte, europäischen Gesundheitssysteme von umfangreichen Datenpannen betroffen. Bei der elektronischen Patientenakte in Deutschland ist noch nichts passiert. Sicherheitsforscher <a href="https://www.ccc.de/de/updates/2024/ende-der-epa-experimente">warnen</a> jedoch, Kriminelle könnten mit wenig Aufwand auf beliebige Patientenakten zugreifen. Falls es zu Hacking, Datendiebstahl oder Datenverlust kommen sollte, können viel mehr Informationen verloren gehen als ohne elektronische Patientenakte.</p>
 



 

			
		
 
 



<p>2. Direkter Zugriff: Mit der elektronischen Patientenakte können behandelnde Ärzte, deine Apotheker, deine Physiotherapeuten, dein Pflegeheim, usw., sowohl in Deutschland als auch künftig im EU-Ausland deine elektronische Patientenakte direkt einsehen. Sie können sie auch in ihrer eigenen Praxissoftware speichern. Die Vorteile: Der Datenzugriff kann deine Behandlungen und Medikation wesentlich beschleunigen und verbessern, z. B. auch fehlerhafte Medikamentationen vermeiden. Unterlagen müssen nicht erst angefordert werden und liegen auch im Notfall unmittelbar vor. Doppeluntersuchungen entfallen. Ein möglicher Nachteil könnte sich daraus ergeben, dass für&nbsp;andere medizinische Stellen nicht relevante Behandlungen, Medikamentationen, etc. abgerufen und somit eingesehen werden können (z.B. dein Zahnarzt oder Apotheker könnte von deiner Psychotherapie oder Geschlechtskrankheit erfahren).</p>



<p>Ohne elektronische Patientenakte wirst du, so wie du es bisher kennst und möglicherweise erlebt hast, auf einem Anamnesebogen nach Vorbehandlungen, Medikamentationen, Unverträglichkeiten, Allergien, usw. gefragt. Gegebenenfalls werden weitere Unterlagen angefordert wie z. B. MRT-Aufnahmen, usw. Es gibt auch einen papierbasierten, bundeseinheitlichen Medikationsplan, den du dir ausdrucken lassen kannst. Dieser ist aber auch in der elektronischen Patientenakte speicherbar.</p>



<p>Mit elektronischer Patientenakte kannst du mündlich, über eine App oder über deine Krankenkasse einzelne (ärztliche) Leistungserbringer komplett vom Zugriff auf deine elektronische Patientenakte ausschließen. Dies ist mit gewissen Herausforderungen verbunden. Du hast auch das Recht, gegenüber Leistungserbringern der Übertragung von einzelnen Informationen in die elektronische Patientenakte zu widersprechen. Du kannst einzelne Dokumente auch nachträglich wieder aus ihrer elektronischen Patientenakte löschen (lassen) – leider wieder recht kompliziert. Bedenke, dass Löschungen Nachteile für deine Behandlung nach sich ziehen können.</p>



<p>3. Weitergabe an Dritte: Deine elektronische Patientenakte kann für bestimmte Zwecke auch an Politik und Behörden, Forschende und Wirtschaftsunternehmen (z.B. Technologieunternehmen und Pharmaindustrie) weitergegeben werden. Die Chancen: Anonymisierte Gesundheitsdatenanalysen ermöglichen bedeutende Fortschritte in der Pandemie- und Endemieeindämmung, z. B. durch Früherkennung, sowie in der Forschung, z.B. bei der Entwicklung sicherer Medikamente. Die Risiken: Nur teilweise werden Daten vor der Weitergabe anonymisiert. In anderen Fällen werden dein Name und deine Versichertennummer zwar entfernt, aber über andere Kennzeichen bleibst du eindeutig identifizierbar (sog. Pseudonymisierung). So kann es Dritten gelingen, deine Krankheitsgeschichte wieder dir zuzuordnen.</p>



<p>Hinweis: Auch wenn du die elektronische Patientenakte nutzt, kannst du ihrer Weitergabe an Dritte frühestens ab dem 15.01.2025 separat widersprechen (über eine App deiner Krankenkasse oder durch <a href="https://widerspruch-epa.de/widerspruch-gegen-uebernahme-forschungsdaten/">Brief an ihre Ombudsstelle</a>).</p>



 Ergebnis: Es ist letztendlich deine Entscheidung, ob du&nbsp;eine elektronische Patientenakte haben möchtest oder nicht. 



<p></p>



<p>Wenn du eine elektronische Patientenakte geführt haben möchtest, brauchst du nichts zu tun – sie wird ab 15. Januar 2025 automatisch eingerichtet.</p>



<p>Wenn du dich gegen eine elektronische Patientenakte entscheidest, hilft dir der <a href="https://widerspruch-epa.de/widerspruchs-generator/">Widerspruchs-Generator</a> ein Widerspruchsschreiben zu erstellen. Du kannst auch per Krankenkassen-App oder – bei einigen Krankenkassen – auch <a href="https://www.heise.de/ratgeber/Widerspruch-bei-der-ePA-fuer-alle-Was-bisher-bekannt-ist-9710212.html">über deren Website widersprechen</a>.</p>



<p>Du kannst ab dem Moment widersprechen, in dem deine Krankenkasse dich über dein Widerspruchsrecht informiert hat. Ein Widerspruch ist auch nach Ablauf der in dem Schreiben genannten 6-Wochen-Frist jederzeit möglich; dann werden alle bereits gespeicherte Daten wieder aus der elektronischen Patientenakte gelöscht. Solltest du später einmal deine Entscheidung ändern, kannst du deinen Widerspruch jederzeit wieder zurücknehmen und für die Zukunft eine elektronische Patientenakte bekommen.</p>

Such deletion:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  Must delete all mDL information, log information, and any metadata (e.g. settings) that could impart information about the deleted mDL or its use.&nbsp;  Must not require approval by the Issuing Authority.  Must be an option available to an mDL holder on the mDL device  Must be possible when the mDL device is offline.  Should be available to an mDL holder via a request to the Issuing Authority (see below).  <p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>mDL保持者は、mDL保持者のデバイスからmDL保持者のmDLを削除する機能を持たなければならない。</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  すべてのmDL情報、ログ情報、および削除されたmDLまたはその使用に関する情報を与える可能性のあるメタデータ（設定など）を削除すること  発行機関の承認を必要としないこと。  mDLデバイス上でmDL保持者が利用可能なオプションであること。  mDLデバイスがオフラインのときに可能であること。  発行機関（下記参照）へのリクエストにより、mDL保持者が利用可能であること。  <p></p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;デバイスからmDL情報を削除する際の話です。基本的に利用者が自身で削除をすることができること（その際に発行者の承認や接続が不要であること）が求められています。難しいところですね。この章の中で発行したmDL関連情報が適切に扱われていること発行機関が責任をもって確認することが求められる一方で利用者の権利も守らないといけないわけです。まぁ、最低限ウォレット開発者が悪意を持って利用者のデータを扱えないように、というところまでは守りましょう、ってところですね。</p><blockquote><p>Should an mDL device (i.e. a device containing an mDL) be lost or get stolen, it could be beneficial for the mDL holder to have the mDL remotely deleted (or temporarily suspended) by the Issuing Authority. Besides the obvious advantage to the mDL holder, other considerations apply too:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  The mDL holder’s request must be authenticated. It must not be possible for someone other than the mDL holder or the Issuing Authority to delete (or suspend) an mDL.  A “push” capability (from the Issuing Authority to the mDL device) is needed for immediate deletion (or suspension) (see section 6).  Successful deletion (or suspension) depends on network connectivity to the mDL device  The mDL will automatically become unusable (although potentially not inaccessible) when the MSO expires (see section 6).&nbsp;  <p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>mDLデバイス（mDLを含むデバイス）が紛失または盗難に遭った場合、発行機関によってmDLがリモートで削除（または一時的に停止）されることは、mDL保有者にとって有益です。mDL保有者にとっての明らかな利点の他に、他の考慮事項も適用されます：</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  mDL保有者の要求は認証されなければならない。mDL保持者の要求は認証されなければならない。mDL保持者または発行機関以外の者がmDLを削除（または一時停止）することはできない。  即時削除（または一時停止）には、（発行局からmDLデバイスへの）「プッシュ」機能が必要である（セクション6参照）  削除（または一時停止）の成功は、mDLデバイスへのネットワーク接続に依存します。  MSOの有効期限が切れると、mDLは自動的に使用できなくなる（アクセスできなくなる可能性はないが）（セクション6参照）。  <p></p></blockquote><p>やはりスマートフォンベースの話なので当然紛失や盗難に関する考慮は十分に必要です。</p><p>mDLを利用するときはちゃんと認証するのは当たり前として、発行者から発行済みのクレデンシャルをプッシュ等を使って削除できるようにする、また有効期限切れたらウォレット側で自動的に使えなくする、などもちゃんと気を使う必要があります。</p><blockquote><p>In addition, mDL deletion may be needed when an mDL holder wants to transfer an mDL to a new device, when a person moves to another jurisdiction, or when a person dies.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Issuing Authorities should weigh the benefits and challenges associated with a remote delete (or suspension) capability when considering its implementation (see Appendix A).</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>An mDL holder must have the capability to delete activity log information (as defined in section 4.4) the mDL holder may previously have elected to maintain. It is recommended that this capability allows selective deletion (i.e. specific log entries, rather than only an “all or nothing” option).</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>さらに、mDLの削除は、mDL保持者が新しいデバイスにmDLを移したい場合、別の管轄区域に移動する場合、またはmDL保持者が死亡した場合に必要となる可能性がある。</p><p>発行局は、リモート削除（または一時停止）機能の導入を検討する際、その利点と課題を比較検討する必要がある（付録A参照）。</p><p>mDL保持者は、mDL保持者が以前に保持することを選択した活動ログ情報（第4.4項に定義）を削除する機能を持たなければならない。この機能により、選択的な削除（すなわち、「全削除」オプションのみではなく、特定のログエントリーの削除）を可能にすることが推奨される。</p></blockquote><p>mDLを含めデジタルデータを持ち主だけが制御できるようにするのは大切な一方で死亡した場合などの考慮は非常に重要です。マイナンバーカードと保険証の統合をした結果、意識のない救急患者の保険者資格の確認ができない、なんて話も聞きますが、この辺りは例外処理も含めてちゃんとプロセス設計をしておくのが大切です。</p><p>また、ログの削除に関しても選択的に削除することができるようにすべきである、などかなり細かくガイドされている感じがあります。</p><p>4.6.&nbsp;NO TRACKING</p><blockquote><p>“Tracking” is the act of compiling information about an mDL holder and/or an mDL holder’s activity. Any stakeholder (including Issuing Authorities, technology providers, service providers and mDL verifiers) must not track mDL holders or the usage of any mDL except as required by law (e.g. when a drug store dispenses products containing ephedrine).&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>「トラッキング」とは、mDL保持者および/またはmDL保持者の活動に関する情報を収集する行為を指します。いかなるステークホルダー（発行局、テクノロジープロバイダー、サービスプロバイダー、mDLベリファイアーを含む）も、法律で義務付けられている場合（ドラッグストアがエフェドリンを含む製品を調剤する場合など）を除き、mDL保持者やmDLの使用状況を追跡してはなりません。</p></blockquote><p>トラッキングの禁止に関する条項ですね。法的根拠なくトラッキングしてはならない、と。&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Tracking by an mDL verifier can be performed as soon as two different mDL transactions can be linked to each other. This can be countered by designing the solution to maximize anonymity (“characteristic of information that does not permit a personally identifiable information principal to be identified directly or indirectly”, from ISO/IEC 29100) and to maximize unlinkability. Anonymity can be hampered by metadata that may be associated with multiple mDL transactions, e.g. hardware or network addresses, long-term public keys, or session tokens. Consequently, Issuing Authorities must minimize the sharing of static or long-lived metadata.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>mDL検証者による追跡は、2つの異なるmDLトランザクションが互いにリンクされるとすぐに実行できる。これは、匿名性（「個人を特定できる情報主体が直接的または間接的に特定されない情報の特性」、ISO/IEC 29100より）を最大化し、リンク不能性を最大化するようにソリューションを設計することで対抗できる。匿名性は、複数のmDLトランザクションに関連するメタデータ（ハードウェアやネットワークアドレス、長期公開鍵、セッショントークンなど）によって妨げられる可能性がある。そのため、発行局は静的または長期的なメタデータの共有を最小限に抑える必要がある。</p></blockquote><p>これはSD-JWT-VCでも同じ議論がなされていますが、Verifierの結託によるリンク可能性の話ですね。mdocにおける選択的開示については基本的にSD-JWTと類似の考え方なので単体ではリンク可能性に対する対応はできなかったはずです。そのため匿名性を担保するソリューションを別途検討することが必要とされています。&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Although pre-matched transactions hold the promise of maximizing anonymity at a user data level, anonymity in post-matched transactions is limited since the portrait image is always shared. For these transactions it is recommended that Issuing Authorities pursue regulatory protection against tracking by mDL verifiers.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>事前照合取引は、ユーザー・データ・レベルでの匿名性を最大化することが期待できるが、事 後照合取引では肖像画像が常に共有されるため、匿名性は制限される。このような取引の場合、発行機関はmDL検証者による追跡を防ぐため、規制による保護を追求することが推奨されます。</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Solutions using the server retrieval method also pose challenges in preventing tracking. As per design, the Issuing Authority is involved in real time each time an mDL is used by the mDL holder. The Issuing Authority would technically be able to keep track of when an mDL holder uses his/her mDL and keep track of what data is shared. Based on IP address analysis the Issuing Authority would also be able to track an mDL holder’s physical location to some extent. This can be mitigated by placing regulatory limitations on the Issuing Authority11, and will be of value to the extent an mDL holder trusts the Issuing Authority’s adherence to the regulatory limitations. Consequently, Issuing Authorities considering a server retrieval solution should carefully weigh the advantages of this approach against its privacy implications.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>サーバーリトリーバルを使用するソリューションは、追跡を防ぐという課題もある。設計の通り、発行局はmDL保有者がmDLを使用するたびにリアルタイムで関与します。発行局は技術的に、mDL保有者がいつmDLを使用し、どのようなデータが共有されたかを追跡することができます。IPアドレスの分析に基づき、発行局はmDL保持者の物理的な所在地をある程度追跡することもできます。この問題は、発行局に規制上の制限を設けることで緩和することができます11 。そのため、発行局はサーバー検索ソリューションを検討する際、このアプローチの利点とプライバシーへの影響を慎重に比較検討する必要があります。</p></blockquote><p>サーバーリトリーバルは基本的に従来のフェデレーションモデルと同様に発行者への問い合わせが発生するため、トラッキング耐性は低いとされます。この辺りはエコシステムのサイズや参加しているエンティティの関係性などを踏まえて設計していかないといけないポイントですね。&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Since the activity log (see section 4.4) contains a full record of when and potentially where an mDL was used, it is reiterated that access to the activity log must not be possible by anyone other than the mDL holder.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>アクティビティログ（4.4項参照）には、mDLがいつ、どこで使用されたかについての完全な記録が含まれるため、mDL保持者以外の者がアクティビティログにアクセスできないようにする必要があります。</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>今日もこの辺りにしておきましょう。</p><p><br></p>

As standards in this respect are still under development, each Issuing Authority should take great care to ensure that the design of its solution supports this requirement. At minimum, Issuing Authorities must adhere to the following:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>発行局は、mDL保持者のデバイスに保存されたすべてのmDLデータが適切に保護されていることを確認する必要があります。この点に関する標準はまだ開発中であるため、各発行局はソリューションの設計がこの要件を確実にサポートするよう、細心の注意を払う必要があります。発行局は、最低限以下の事項を遵守しなければなりません：</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;原文でも太字で強調されているとおり、mDL App（ウォレット）に保持されているmDLデータが保護されていることを発行者が確認することが求められています。この責任分解の考え方は非常に重要ですね。欧州でもそうですが発行者となる国が認定したウォレットが必要になるのはこのような背景からきていると思います。しかしこうなるとApple WalletやGoogle Walletに格納されたクレデンシャルが適切に管理されていることをどこまで国は確認できるんだろうか、、、と気になってきますね。</p><p>具体的な要件が続きます。</p><blockquote><p></p>  mDL information must be stored in encrypted form  Private key material must be protected in a security module designed for the safekeeping of key material.  The mDL holder must be authenticated when any mDL data is accessed or released, at a point in time that is sufficiently close (as determined by the Issuing Authority) to the time of the access or release. Issuing Authorities that want to leverage device unlocking to protect mDL data must include measures to ensure that this feature has not been disabled by the mDL holder (also see section 7).  Example: If an app authenticates the mDL holder when the mDL app is accessed, an Issuing Authority should set a time limit after which authentication of the mDL holder is again required before the release of mDL data.&nbsp;  mDL data must be released to an mDL verifier only via the following:   an ISO/IEC 18013-5 compliant interface.  an ISO/IEC 18013-7 compliant interface.  As an alternative to ISO/IEC 18013-7, an over-the-Internet interface as envisioned in Appendix C that:   Complies with Appendix C items 2.b and 2.f, and&nbsp;  Has been approved by the AAMVA Identity Management Committee.    For sharing mDL data between apps on a phone via an interface other than those listed above, an interface compliant with Appendix C items 2.b and 2.f and that has been approved by the AAMVA Identity Management Committee&nbsp;  mDL情報は暗号化された形で保存されなければならない。  秘密鍵は、鍵の保管のために設計されたセキュリティ・モジュールで保護されなければならない。  mDL データがアクセスまたは公開される際には、アクセスまたは公開の時点に（発行局が決定する）十分 に近い時点で、mDL 所持者が認証されなければならない。デバイスのロック解除を活用してmDLデータを保護したい発行局は、この機能がmDL保持者によって無効化されていないことを保証する手段を含める必要があります（セクション7も参照）。  例 アプリがmDLアプリにアクセスしたときにmDLの所有者を認証する場合、発行局は、mDLデータの公開前にmDLの所有者の認証が再度必要となる制限時間を設定する必要があります。  mDLデータは、以下を経由してのみmDL検証者に公開されなければならない：   ISO/IEC 18013-5に準拠したインターフェース。  ISO/IEC 18013-7準拠のインターフェース。  ISO/IEC 18013-7 に代わるものとして、付録 C で想定されているインターネット上のインター フェース：   付録Cの項目2.bおよび2.fに準拠し、かつ  AAMVA アイデンティティ管理委員会によって承認されている。    上記以外のインタフェースを介して携帯電話のアプリ間で mDL データを共有する場合は、付 録 C 項目 2.b および 2.f に準拠し、AAMVA アイデンティティ管理委員会によって承 認されたインタフェース。  <p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p></blockquote><p>かなり細かく要件が決まってますね。EUでも鍵をどこに置くかは色々と議論がありましたが、AAMVAではセキュリティ・モジュールになってますね。クラウドベースのHSMとかは選択肢に入らないのかな？あと、Holderのプレゼンスや認証のタイミング、ウォレットのアンロックが無効化されていないことの確認など色々とガイドがありますがどうやって確認するんだ？？って気もしますが。こうなってきるとやはり専用ウォレットみたいな話になってきそうですねぇ。。</p><blockquote><p>Note 1: This requirement prohibits the sharing of mDL data using the mDL as a “flash pass” (i.e. by showing an image of a credential to a verifier); also see section 8.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>注 1：この要件は、mDL を「フラッシュ・パス」（すなわち、検証者にクレデンシャルの画像を見せること）として使用して mDLデータを共有することを禁止している。</p></blockquote><p>これも重要ですね。以前紹介したパートにも書いてありましたが基本的にmDLは目視で確認するためのものではない、ということですね。</p><p>4.4.&nbsp;ACTIVITY LOG</p><blockquote><p>The mDL app must be capable of maintaining an activity log. The mDL app must allow the mDL holder to decide if an activity log must be maintained or not. It is recommended that the mDL app requires the mDL holder to explicitly choose for or against keeping an activity log upon setup (i.e. no defaults, and in addition to being able to change this subsequently). The activity log and related settings must be accessible only to the mDL holder (also see section 4.6). The activity log must allow for the recording of all mDL transactions. In this context, an mDL transaction is the sharing of information by an mDL holder with an mDL verifier, as well as any provisioning, update, or communication action between the mDL and the Issuing Authority. At minimum, the following must be recordable for any transaction: Transaction timestamp; type of transaction (e.g. update or data sharing); in case of a data sharing transaction the data that was shared, and to the extent that it can be gathered, information about the identity of the mDL verifier. It is recommended that the mDL app provides the mDL holder the capability to select what types of activities are recorded in the activity log (i.e. rather than only an “all or nothing” option). It is also recommended that the mDL app includes functionality to help the mDL holder monitor and manage the size of the activity log within the capabilities of the mDL holder’s device. The mDL app must provide an option to the mDL holder to export the activity log.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>mDLアプリは、アクティビティログを維持できなければならない。mDLアプリは、アクティビティログを保持するかどうかをmDL保持者が決定できなければならない。mDLアプリは、セットアップ時に、mDL保有者がアクティビティログの保持の可否を明示的に選択することを推奨します（すなわち、デフォルトではなく、さらにその後変更できるようにします）。アクティビティログおよび関連する設定は、mDL保持者のみがアクセス可能でなければなりません（4.6項も参照）。アクティビティログは、すべてのmDLトランザクションの記録を可能にしなければならない。ここでいう mDL トランザクションとは、mDL 保持者が mDL 検証者と情報を共有すること、および mDL と発行局との間でプロビジョニング、更新、または通信を行うことである。どのようなトランザクションでも、最低限、以下の情報は記録可能でなければならない： トランザクションのタイムスタンプ、トランザクションのタイプ（更新またはデータ共有など）、データ 共有トランザクションの場合は共有されたデータ、および収集可能な範囲で mDL 検証者の身元に関する情報。mDLアプリは、活動ログに記録される活動の種類を選択する機能をmDL保持者に提供することが推奨される（すなわち、「all or nothing」オプションのみではなく）。また、mDLアプリには、mDL保持者がmDL保持者のデバイスの能力の範囲内でアクティビティログのサイズを監視および管理するのに役立つ機能が含まれることが推奨されます。mDLアプリは、mDL保持者がアクティビティログをエクスポートできるオプションを提供する必要があります。</p></blockquote><p>次はログの話題です。アクティビティログはプライバシーの観点からも非常に重要なものですので、Holderが完全に制御できるものである必要があることが強調されています。この辺りもウォレットソフトウェアを開発する際は留意したいポイントですね。</p><blockquote><p>If an Issuing Authority allows an mDL holder to hold the same mDL on more than one device, the activity log settings on each device should be independent of each other. It is recommended that there be no synchronization of the activity log or activity log settings between the two devices. Any synchronization features that are provided must adhere to the following:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  Synchronization must be an option that can be enabled or disabled by the mDL holder. The process to enable synchronization must require the mDL holder to prove access to both devices.&nbsp;  Synchronization must occur directly between the devices in question.

 こんにちは、富士榮です。  <br>  引き続きAAMVAの<a href="https://www.aamva.org/getmedia/8d8fbb1f-1ec0-4b25-89a1-b90c36163edb/mdl-implementation-guidelines-v1-4.pdf">Mobile Drivers License Implementation Guidelines 1.4</a>を読んでいきます。   <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEi85q8IPb56W5CIBBhWuklhFDxdF3kKtk_aGN65-fLtdEYJ5aX1p9So9JtqZQEMRGO4EW6Abqt41KCuQRb77IZFHKhFk-jcVGGWV1ETizuK3OgxNNvxgphB0CMgGG4CJQM3ASdfhzVQobyNMzl_KAXkHKmAcfk7amN5a8iOw9tj0BF657SbWgr4x347eSQs"></a> <br><br>  ようやく4章の「PRIVACY AND SECURITY」に入ります。4章も結構長いんですよね。。。ただ、結構重要な章なので細かくみていきたいと思います。  <br>  4.1.&nbsp;INTRODUCTION <blockquote> The privacy of an mDL holder has been paramount in the mDL design process from the start. Care was and is being taken in all the work to ensure that methods and means are available to protect mDL holder privacy. The subsections that follow elaborate in more detail on different aspects of privacy protection and security. </blockquote><blockquote><p>mDLの設計プロセスでは、当初からmDL保持者のプライバシーが最優先されてきました。すべての作業において、mDL保持者のプライバシーを保護する方法と手段が利用できるよう、細心の注意が払われています。以下のサブセクションでは、プライバシー保護とセキュリティのさまざまな側面について詳しく説明します。</p></blockquote><p>4.2.&nbsp;DATA MINIMIZATION AND SELECTIVE DATA RELEASE</p><blockquote><p>A primary component of privacy involves the ability of an mDL holder to only share some information. This is achieved by two related but distinct measures:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  Data minimization: A decision by an Issuing Authority to record fractional information about an attribute in an mDL, thus empowering an mDL holder to share less information than would otherwise have been the case. For example, an Issuing Authority can decide to include9 the optional age_birth_year field in an mDL in addition to the (mandatory) date of birth. This will allow the mDL holder to share only a birth year as opposed to a date of birth. Another example would be to include the resident city in addition to a full address.&nbsp;  Selective data release: Allowing an mDL holder to decide which of the data fields requested by an mDL verifier will be released to the Verifier.  <p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>As noted in section 2, it is important for Issuing Authorities to understand that ISO/IEC 18013-5 primarily specifies interfaces. The interfaces support both data minimization and selective data release. It is recommended that Issuing Authorities implement and provision as many of the optional minimized data elements, defined in ISO/IEC 18013-5 and in this document, as possible.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>プライバシーの主要な構成要素は、mDL保持者が一部の情報のみを共有する能力である。これは、2つの関連するが異なる手段によって達成される：</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  データの最小化：データの最小化：発行局が、mDLに属性情報の一部を記録することを決定すること。例えば、発行局はmDLに、（必須である）生年月日に加え、オプションのage_birth_yearフィールドを含める9 ことができます。これにより、mDLの所持者は、生年月日ではなく、生年のみを共有することができます。他の例としては、完全な住所に加えて、居住地の市町村を含めることができる。  選択的データ公開：mDL保有者が、mDLベリファイアから要求されたデータフィールドのうち、どのフィールドをベリファイアに開示するかを決定できるようにすること。  <p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>セクション2で述べたように、発行局はISO/IEC 18013-5が主にインタフェースを規定していることを理解することが重要である。インターフェースはデータの最小化と選択的なデータ公開の両方をサポートする。発行局は、ISO/IEC 18013-5 および本文書で定義されているオプションの最小化データエレメントを可能な限り実装し、提供することが推奨される。</p></blockquote><p>Privacy by designということです。ISO/IEC 18013-5ではデータの最小化と選択的情報開示の両方をサポートしているので、本書の原則を踏まえてちゃんと実装しなさいよ、と。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>In addition, Issuing Authorities must ensure that mDL apps to which they provision data support at least the following:&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  In case the request was received electronically, the mDL app must clearly convey what data was requested, and whether the mDL verifier intends to retain the information. If the request is presented in summarized form in the user interface (e.g. “Identity and driving privilege data” as opposed to “First Name, Last Name, DOB, Driving privileges”), means must be available to give the mDL holder visibility of the details of such a summarized form, both before and during a transaction.  The mDL app must provide the mDL holder full control over which data elements to share with the mDL verifier.&nbsp;  ISO/IEC 18013-5 requires the portrait image to be shared if the portrait was requested and if any other data element is released (to enable the mDL verifier to tie the mDL information to the person presenting the information). The app must support a graceful and informed exit from the request if the holder opts not to share the portrait image when requested.  If blanket sharing options are used, measures must be implemented to ensure that the mDL holder remains aware of what is being released when such an option is in effect. An mDL holder must also be able to opt out of or cancel any blanket sharing function.  <p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Issuing Authorities (and their app providers) are encouraged to devise solutions that will minimize transaction friction without compromising the above requirements.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>さらに、発行局はデータを提供するmDLアプリが少なくとも以下をサポートしていることを確認する必要があります：</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  要求が電子的に受信された場合、mDLアプリは、どのようなデータが要求されたのか、またmDLベリファイアがその情報を保持する意図があるかどうかを明確に伝えなければならない。要求がユーザーインターフェースに要約された形で提示される場合（例えば、「姓名、DOB、運転権限」ではなく「身分証明書および運転権限データ」）、取引の前および取引中の両方において、mDL保有者がそのような要約された形の詳細を可視化できる手段を利用できなければなりません。  mDLアプリは、どのデータ要素をmDLベリファイアと共有するかについて、mDL保持者に完全なコントロールを提供しなければならない。  ISO/IEC 18013-5では、肖像画が要求された場合、およびその他のデータ要素が公開された場合、肖像画を共有することが要求されています（mDLベリファイアがmDL情報を提示者に紐付けることを可能にするため）。アプリは、所持者が要求されたときに肖像画を共有しないことを選択した場合、その要求から 潔く、かつ通知された形で抜けることをサポートしなければならない。  包括的共有オプションが使用される場合、そのようなオプションが有効であるとき に、mDL保有者が何が公表されるかを確実に認識し続けるための措置が講じられなけれ ばならない。また、mDLの保有者は、包括的共有機能をオプトアウトまたはキャンセルできなければならない。  <p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>発行局（およびそのアプリプロバイダ）は、上記の要件を損なうことなく、取引の摩擦を最小化するソリューショ ンを考案することが推奨される。&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>データを要求・共有する目的・意図を明確に伝える、そして提供しないことをユーザが選択できるようにする、オプトアウトできるようにもする、と。どれも基本的なことではありますが実装者にとってはどのようなUXを提供するかが腕の見せ所になると重要なポイントの一つでもあります。この辺りは日本でもウォレット開発をする方々も参考にすべき点だと思います。</p><p><br></p><p>細かくみていこうと思うので少し細切れにしていきます。</p><p>ということで今日はここまで。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>

<p>こんにちは、富士榮です。</p><p>引き続き<a href="https://www.aamva.org/getmedia/8d8fbb1f-1ec0-4b25-89a1-b90c36163edb/mdl-implementation-guidelines-v1-4.pdf">AAMVAのMobile Drivers License Implementation Guidelines 1.4</a>を読んでいきます。</p><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjheuE0pW_Gibv8p14gefJol34or8iPp4a4pWzoPAcrwPFSnEcPxU_72Sm-ExWFQ9t2RCpx7ejVdNdfYlx6MQU7rbTTogPcw_g4eVMbXISy_BXiGxaohW_fWS5bYPAjua61aWqWhPNzM0qgsHk8hW6Nte3ErLLd_z4ctKlIPicw5_BHk-4BqaKmrCO3fdBu"></a> <br>まだ３章が続きますが今回で３章は終わりです。<p></p><p><br></p><p>3.6.&nbsp;IACA ROOT CERTIFICATE</p><blockquote><p>In Table B.1 of ISO/IEC 18013-5, on the table row for the “ISSUER” certificate component, replace:</p></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>stateOrProvinceName is optional.

This enables readers to always know which version of the data structure is present on a credential since the full data string is always read. This is not true for an mDL. An mDL reader has to explicitly request individual data elements, and does not know in advance which data elements are present or what version of a data set is supported.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>AAMVA カード設計仕様の 2D バーコードのデータ構造には、バージョン番号が含まれている。これにより、完全なデータ文字列が常に読み取られるため、読み手はデータ構造のどのバージョンがクレデンシャルに存在するかを常に知ることができる。これは mDL には当てはまらない。mDL リーダは個々のデータ要素を明示的に要求する必要があり、どのデータ要素が存在する か、またはデータ・セットのどのバージョンがサポートされているかを事前に知ることはできない。</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>One approach to address this is to add a “version” data element to the AAMVA namespace. To be useful an mDL reader would have to obtain this data element before making a subsequent request for additional data. Allowing the release of this data element without mDL holder approval is possible; requiring approval may confuse an mDL holder and increase transaction friction. Regardless, the 2-step process would add complexity (an mDL reader would still have to allow for not receiving a response to such a request) and add time to the transaction. Such an approach would also be unique to mDL in North America.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>これに対処する1つの方法は、AAMVA名前空間に「バージョン」データ要素を追加することである。mDLの読者は、追加データを要求する前にこのデータ要素を取得しなければならない。mDL保持者の承認なしにこのデータ要素の公開を許可することは可能です。承認を必要とすると、mDL保持者を混乱させ、取引の摩擦を増大させる可能性があります。いずれにせよ、2段階のプロセスは複雑さを増し（mDLリーダーは、そのような要求に対する返答を受け取らないことを許容しなければならない）、取引に時間を要する。また、このようなアプローチは北米のmDLに特有のものである。</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Instead, versioning of the AAMVA mDL data element set is achieved as follows:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  If needed, create a new identifier. This applies if there is a change to an existing data element, or if a completely new data element is added. Set a date by which mDL apps and mDL readers must support the new identifier (Dayx in Figure 2). “Support” as used here means that an mDL app must allow an Issuing Authority to provision the identifier into the app, and that an mDL reader must be able to read the new identifier.&nbsp;  For the old identifier, set a date by which mDL apps and mDL readers do not need to support the old identifier anymore (Dayy in Figure 2). This is also the date by which Issuing Authorities must be provisioning the new identifier.  <p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>代わりに、AAMVA mDLデータ要素セットのバージョニングは、以下のように行われる：</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  必要に応じて、新しい識別子を作成する。これは、既存のデータ要素に変更がある場合、またはまったく新しいデータ要素が追加される場合に適用されます。mDLアプリとmDLリーダーが新しい識別子をサポートしなければならない期日を設定します（図2のDay x）。ここでいう「サポート」とは、mDLアプリが発行機関に識別子をアプリにプロビジョニングできるようにすること、およびmDLリーダーが新しい識別子を読み取れるようにすることを意味します。  旧識別子については、mDLアプリとmDLリーダーが旧識別子をサポートする必要がなくなる日付を設定します（図2のDay y）。これは、発行局が新しい識別子をプロビジョニングする期日でもあります。&nbsp;  <p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Figure 2 also reflects other requirements on both the mDL reader and the mDL app. The main advantage of the approach illustrated in Figure 2 is that, in case of changing an existing identifier, the Issuing Authority will have the time between the two dates to provision the new identifier (and deprecate the old identifier) to all its mDLs with the knowledge that mDL readers should be able to accommodate either identifier (the highlighted option in Figure 2). In the case where a new identifier is added (i.e. when there is no change to an existing identifier), the two dates may be on the same day.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>図2には、mDLリーダーとmDLアプリの両方に対するその他の要件も反映されています。図2に示されたアプローチの主な利点は、既存の識別子を変更する場合、発行局は2つの日付の間に、mDLリーダーがどちらの識別子にも対応できることを前提に、すべてのmDLに新しい識別子を提供する（古い識別子を廃止する）時間を持つことができることです（図2のハイライトされたオプション）。新しい識別子が追加される場合（既存の識別子に変更がない場合）、2つの日付は同じ日になる可能性があります。</p><p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Ideally mDL readers would ask for the old identifier up to Dayy and for the new identifier thereafter. However, it is likely that readers would, at least around the change date, ask for both. It is also likely that an mDL would, especially around Dayy, include both identifiers. How the request is presented to the mDL holder, and how approval to share is administered, is left to implementers. Nevertheless, a simple approach could be for the mDL to present only one request, for the new identifier, to the mDL holder.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>理想的には、mDLの読者はDay yまでは旧識別子を、それ以降は新識別子を要求するだろう。しかし、少なくとも変更日前後には、読者は両方の識別子を要求すると思われる。また、mDLは、特にDayyの前後には、両方の識別子を含むと思われる。どのようにリクエストをmDL保持者に提示し、どのように共有の承認を行うかは、実装者に委ねられている。とはいえ、単純なアプローチとしては、mDLがmDL保持者に提示する要求は、新しい識別子のための1つのみである。</p></blockquote><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjhpKZpmtHdpxVCCwwAKMtV_dcR9dTJ0qNOyEf6IeiqWqdvkGzDtfypoVDg1yyriuQFZUYGmH_-6Gwpmnk89D1VB673A4oDmpeJn3Y70AXiEZgh03qvwkd9zgCGiu41f1-Cf-evePqOQvlMxJyfiAfp56dM-gQ34jp1dJYCl-mphywPE6HYyO0or_fUrmhT"></a> <br>バージョニングに関するコンセプトがちゃんとしていますね。リードタイムをうまく作ってスムーズに移行できる様にすることができる様にしています。<p></p><p><br></p>3.8.&nbsp;ISSUING AUTHORITY SPECIFIC DATA<blockquote> ISO/IEC 18013-5 allows for the creation of additional namespaces, in like manner as the AAMVA namespace defined in this document (see clause 7.2.8 in ISO/IEC 18013-5). Issuing Authorities can use this mechanism to add additional fields to an mDL. The Issuing Authority would be responsible for communicating such an additional namespace to mDL verifiers that need to be able to read the Issuing Authority-specific data.  Note: ISO/IEC 18013-5 also lends itself to being adopted for the issuing of credentials separate from an mDL, for example fishing licenses, health credentials, or watercraft licenses.&nbsp; </blockquote><blockquote><p>ISO/IEC 18013-5では、本文書で定義されているAAMVA名前空間と同様に、追加の名前空間を 作成することができる（ISO/IEC 18013-5の7.2.8項参照）。発行局はこのメカニズムを使用して、mDLにフィールドを追加できる。発行局は、発行局固有のデータを読み取る必要のあるmDL検証者に、このような追加名前空間を伝達する責任を負う。</p><p>注：ISO/IEC 18013-5 は、漁業免許証、健康証明書、水上バイク免許証など、mDL とは別のクレデンシャルの発行にも採用できる。</p><p></p></blockquote><p><br></p><p>今回はここまでです。次は４章です。</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>

The portrait image therefore needs to be of suitable quality for this purpose. ISO/IEC 18013-5 requires the portrait to comply with Annex D of ISO/IEC 18013-2:2020, which in turn requires the portrait image to be at least 192 pixels wide and 240 pixels high. In addition, ISO/IEC 18013-2 requires portrait images intended for automated face recognition to comply with ISO/IEC 19794-5, which among other requirements requires 90 pixels between the centers of the eyes. However, it should be noted that these requirements were created in the context of storage on a physical card and in machine-readable formats with limited storage capacity compared to an mDL.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>肖像画像は、立会取引においてmDLを提示する人物とmDLを照合する主要な手段です。したがって、肖像画像はこの目的に適した品質である必要があります。ISO/IEC 18013-5は、肖像画がISO/IEC 18013-2:2020の附属書Dに準拠することを要求しており、この附属書Dは、肖像画が少なくとも幅192ピクセル、高さ240ピクセルであることを要求している。さらに、ISO/IEC 18013-2は、自動顔認識用の肖像画像について、ISO/IEC 19794-5に準拠することを要求しており、この要件では、特に目の中心間が90ピクセルであることが要求されています。ただし、これらの要件は、物理的なカードへの保存や、mDLに比べて保存容量が限られる機械読み取り可能なフォーマットでの保存を想定して作成されたものであることに留意する必要があります。</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>It would therefore be possible to include a portrait image of much higher resolution in an mDL. Arguments for going this route include higher accuracy when using the portrait image as a probe image in 1:n biometric searching, and making it easier for a human to compare the portrait image with the mDL holder. Arguments against going this route include the following:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>従って、mDLにはるかに高解像度の肖像画像を含めることが可能である。この経路をとることへの賛成意見には、1:nの生体認証検索でプローブ画像として肖像画を使用する際の精度が高くなること、人間が肖像画とmDLの所持者を比較しやすくなることなどがあります。このルートに反対する意見には、以下のようなものがあります：</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>1. A larger portrait image can negatively affect mDL transaction times（より大きなポートレート画像は、mDLのトランザクション時間に悪影響を与える可能性があります）</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>2.&nbsp;A better-quality portrait image could arguably be less privacy preserving than a smaller portrait image.（より質の高いポートレート画像は、より小さなポートレート画像よりもプライバシーの保護に劣る可能性がある）</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>3.&nbsp;The primary purpose of the portrait image is a 1:1 match with the mDL holder. If this match is performed biometrically, the smaller portrait size should be sufficient.（肖像画像の主な目的は、mDLの所持者と1対1で照合することです。この照合が生体認証で行われる場合は、肖像画のサイズは小さくても十分です）</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Issuing Authorities should carefully consider all these points when deciding on a portrait image size. It is recommended that Issuing Authorities opt for a smaller rather than for a larger portrait image.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>発行局は、肖像画のサイズを決定する際、これらの点を慎重に考慮する必要があります。発行局は、大きな縦長画像よりも小さな縦長画像を選ぶことを推奨します。</p></blockquote><p>結構細かいレベルで顔写真の要件が決まっているんですね。</p><p><br></p><p>3.4.&nbsp;SIGNATURE IMAGE</p><blockquote><p>ISO/IEC 18013-5 does not prescribe anything other than that the image shall be in JPEG or JPEG2000 format. Building on the requirements for a signature image in ISO/IEC 18013-1 and in the AAMVA Card Design Standard, if present the signature image must be an accurate and recognizable representation of the original signature. Care should be given to image capture, processing, digitization, and compression.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>ISO/IEC 18013-5 は、画像が JPEG または JPEG2000 フォーマットであること以外には何も規定していない。ISO/IEC 18013-1およびAAMVAカード設計基準における署名画像の要件に基づき、署名画像が存在す る場合は、元の署名を正確かつ認識可能な形で表現しなければならない。画像のキャプチャ、処理、デジタル化、および圧縮には注意を払う必要がある。</p></blockquote><p><br></p><p>3.5.&nbsp;MDL CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROTOCOLS</p><blockquote><p>In line with recommendations from the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security, certain cryptographic constructs must not be supported for mDL solutions built in accordance with this document. At the same time, interoperability needs to be retained so mDL readers can successfully interact with an mDL originating from elsewhere.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>米国国立標準技術研究所（NIST）およびカナダ・サイバーセキュリティセンターの勧告に従い、この文書に従って構築されたmDLソリューションでは、特定の暗号構造をサポートしてはなりません。同時に、mDLリーダーが他の場所から発信されたmDLと正常にやり取りできるよう、相互運用性を維持する必要があります。</p>  To this end, the AAMVA mDL Implementation Guidelines require the following changes to be applied to ISO/IEC 18013-5:  </blockquote><blockquote><p>このため、AAMVA mDL実装ガイドラインでは、ISO/IEC 18013-5に以下の変更を適用することを要求している：</p></blockquote><p>ここも量が多いので割愛しますが、Cipher SuiteをNISTの要求に従って変更したりしていますので、他の国が単純にmdocだからISO/IEC 18013-5に従ってリーダーを実装してもAAMVAのmDLは読めないって言う状態になるんだろうなぁ。。。と思います。</p><p><br></p><p>ということでここまでです。３章がもう少しだけ続きます。</p>

<p>こんにちは、富士榮です。</p><p>引き続きAAMVAの<a href="https://www.aamva.org/getmedia/8d8fbb1f-1ec0-4b25-89a1-b90c36163edb/mdl-implementation-guidelines-v1-4.pdf">Mobile Drivers License Implementation Guidelines 1.4</a>を読んでいきます。</p><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhBEDtZGMY8KAvIcWmF_nr7Yae50KCINUkNzovO1xmrtAspfVN2sSwB2GfcvrW57NmqFULeLGPxOnGCZ84E-CSILP6uuEaHW9Rne1Adv0oXwwa3qzw7MXsdEf6PbeBw_42rQJwErsEYbxCQUt3k_3iCGGqOu_76BLge31-ltvFySpfSQ19FBewhEgHSYLcA"></a> <br>今回は２章のmDL Solution Overviewを見ていきます。<p></p><blockquote><p>An mDL can be described as leveraging a mobile device to transfer (or cause to be transferred) driver’s license information to an mDL verifier, who cryptographically authenticates the information using the Issuing
Authority’s public key. A visual rendering of a DL on a mobile device’s display (and which can be misused as a
“flash pass”) therefore does not qualify as an mDL (also see section 8).</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>mDL は、発行局の公開鍵を使用して情報を暗号的に検証する mDL検証者に運転免許証情報を転送する （または転送させる）ために、モバイル機器を活用するものと説明できる。したがって、モバイル機器のディスプレイ上に DL を視覚的に表示するもの（「フラッシュパス」として悪用される可能性があるもの）は、mDL として認められない（セクション 8 も参照）。</p></blockquote><p>スクショやオレオレはダメってことですね。&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>An mDL solution can be described in terms of the following three properties:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>mDLソリューションは、以下の3つの性質で説明できる：</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>1. Data retrieval method. The device retrieval method (sometimes referred to as the offline model) works without outside connectivity (for both the mDL holder’s device and the mDL reader) at the time the transaction takes place, thus requiring the mDL data to reside on the mDL holder’s device. Under the server retrieval method (sometimes referred to as the online model, and not to be confused with use of an mDL in an unattended transaction setting such as over the Internet) mDL data is retrieved in real time directly from the Issuing Authority. ISO/IEC 18013-5 requires an mDL to support device retrieval, and allows a device to additionally support server retrieval.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>1. データ検索方式。デバイス検索方式（オフラインモデルと呼ばれることもある）では、取引時に外部（mDL保持者のデバイスとmDLリーダーの両方）に接続することなく動作するため、mDLデータはmDL保持者のデバイスに存在する必要がある。サーバー検索方式（オンラインモデルと呼ばれることもあり、インターネット経由のような無人トランザクションでのmDLの使用と混同されないよう注意）では、mDLのデータは発行機関からリアルタイムで直接取得される。ISO/IEC 18013-5は、mDLがデバイスの検索をサポートすることを要求しており、さらにデバイスがサーバーの検索をサポートすることを認めている。</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>2. Transaction type. An attended transaction is one where the mDL holder and the mDL verifier are in close proximity to each other. The engagement mechanisms currently reflected in ISO/IEC 18013-5 (QR code, NFC) were selected to support such close proximity. An unattended transaction is one where the mDL holder and the mDL verifier are not in close proximity, e.g. when an mDL holder wants to provide identity or proof of age to an online retailer. ISO/IEC 18013-5 does not currently support unattended transactions. However, work is ongoing to standardize a solution.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>2. トランザクションの種類。対面型トランザクションとは、mDL保有者とmDL検証者が近接しているトランザクションのことである。現在ISO/IEC 18013-5に反映されているエンゲージメントの仕組み（QRコード、NFC）は、このような近接をサポートするために選択された。無人トランザクションとは、mDL 保持者と mDL 検証者が近接していないトランザクショ ンのことであり、たとえば、mDL 保持者がオンライン小売業者に ID または年齢証明を提供する場合などである。ISO/IEC 18013-5 は現在、無人トランザクションをサポートしていない。ただし、ソリューションを標準化する作業が進行中である。&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>3. Timing of (and responsibility for) matching. This property is about the responsibility for confirming, at transaction time, that the person presenting the mDL data is the person described by the mDL data. In a post-matched transaction, the link between the mDL Presenter and the mDL data is made after the mDL data is shared and is performed by the mDL verifier. This happens by comparing the portrait image in the mDL with the person presenting the mDL. ISO/IEC 18013-5 supports postmatched transactions. In a pre-matched transaction, the link between the mDL Presenter and the mDL is made right before the mDL data is shared. Although the Issuing Authority should not be involved in real time, the Issuing Authority does take responsibility for certifying the link. The mDL verifier receives only the confirmation that the person presenting the mDL data is the person described by the shared mDL data. ISO/IEC 18013-5 does not currently support pre-matched transactions. However, work is ongoing to standardize a solution (and notably one that does not involve the Issuing Authority at transaction time).</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>3. 照合のタイミング（および責任）。このプロパティは、mDLデータの提示者がmDLデータに記述された本人であることをトランザクション時に確認する責任に関するものである。マッチング後のトランザクションでは、mDL提示者とmDLデータのリンクは、mDLデータが共有された後に行われ、mDL検証者によって実行される。これは、mDL内の肖像画像とmDL提示者を比較することで行われる。ISO/IEC 18013-5 はポストマッチトランザクションをサポートしている。事前照合トランザクションでは、mDL提示者とmDLのリンクは、mDLデータが共有される直前に行われる。発行局はリアルタイムで関与すべきではないが、発行局はリンクを認証する責任を負う。mDLの検証者は、mDLデータの提示者が共有されたmDLデータに記述された本人であることの確認のみを受ける。ISO/IEC 18013-5は現在、事前照合トランザクションをサポートしていない。しかし、（特にトランザクション時に発行局が関与しない）ソリューションを標準化するための作業が進行中である。</p></blockquote><p>デバイスリトリーバル、サーバーリトリーバルの２方式があること、対面、非対面のシナリオが定義されていること、そして検証者がHolderバインディングを行うことが求められている、ということです。本人確認書類として利用することを考えると当然ですね。&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>With this as background, Figure 1 provides a high-level overview of the mDL ecosystem described in ISO/IEC 18013-5.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>これを背景に、図1はISO/IEC 18013-5で説明されているmDLエコシステムのハイレベルな概要を示している。</p></blockquote><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjlRKfp1Zh0yZz5SYXLjnkGDTY3J4rdF0dFbsr3NDGiLK4sQllx_gBpLQHsCgRQRxq3QwFboS6_54Tsfqzw1afoJT3-iI95mHWXrXE1HDvhY2iQrpAAAGXYg3pJqyCIvz6fy5agtv-Rogt03J4w8gbf9HE00N3Rt1CVPCFDReQiQ4hrxKYZz-6_RBFRh_1U"></a> <br><br><p></p><blockquote><p>Three interactions are involved:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>3つの相互作用が関係している：&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>1. Interaction between the Issuing Authority and the mDL. This interaction results in getting everything onto an mDL holder’s device that is needed to use the mDL. There is also subsequent interaction between the Issuing Authority and the mDL to keep the mDL information updated. Technical components of this interaction will be standardized in the ISO/IEC 23220 series.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>1. 発行局とmDLの間のインタラクション。このやりとりの結果、mDLを使用するために必要なすべての情報がmDLホルダーのデバイスに取り込まれます。また、発行局とmDLの間には、mDLの情報を更新するための相互作用があります。このインタラクションの技術的なコンポーネントは、ISO/IEC 23220シリーズで標準化される予定です。</p></blockquote><p>Issueの時の仕組みですね。OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuanceでもmdocを扱うことができますので、そちらを非対面のシナリオでは使うケースもありますが、ここではISO 23220が挙げられています。&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>2. Interaction between the mDL and the mDL reader infrastructure of the mDL verifier. This interaction comprises the transfer of technical information to set up a secure communication channel between the two parties, and the subsequent exchange of the driver’s license information (or of a point from where it can be retrieved) that the mDL holder agreed to share. ISO/IEC 18013-5 fully standardizes an interface describing this interaction.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>2. mDLとmDL検証装置のmDL読み取りインフラ間のインタラクション。このインタラクションは、両者間の安全な通信チャネルを設定するための技術情報の転送と、それに続く mDL 保持者が共有に同意した運転免許証情報（またはそれを取得できるポイント）の交換で構成される。ISO/IEC 18013-5 は、このインタラクションを記述するインタフェースを完全に標準化する。</p></blockquote><p>こちらはPresentationの話ですね。こちらもOpenID for Verifiable Presentationでも対応ができる範囲です。ここではISO 18013-5での対応が挙げられています。&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>3. Interaction between the mDL reader infrastructure and the Issuing Authority. This interaction can be used for different purposes, depending on the data retrieval method involved:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  Device retrieval method: The interaction is used by the mDL verifier to obtain the public keys needed to authenticate mDL information. Such interaction can also involve an intermediary entity that aggregates and disseminates certificates. (In North America, AAMVA’s Digital Trust Service performs this function – see section 5.) Regardless, the mDL verifier must trust that the certificate truly comes from a valid Issuing Authority. This interaction does not need to occur at the time of an mDL transaction. ISO/IEC 18013-5 fully standardizes a method supporting this interaction.  Server retrieval method: The interaction is used by the mDL verifier for two purposes:   As in the case for the device retrieval method, to obtain the public key of the Issuing Authority  To pass to the Issuing Authority, in real time, a token that identifies the mDL holder and the mDL, and to receive the actual mDL information back from the Issuing Authority. ISO/IEC 18013-5 fully standardizes an interface describing this interaction   <p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>3. mDLリーダーインフラと発行局との間のインタラクション。このインタラクションは、関係するデータ検索方法に応じて、異なる目的で使用することができる：</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  デバイスの検索方法： このインタラクションは、mDL 検証者が mDL 情報の検証に必要な公開鍵を取得するために使用される。このようなインタラクションには、証明書を集約し普及させる仲介エンティティが関与することもできる。(北米では、AAMVA のデジタル・トラスト・サービスがこの機能を果たす。） いずれにせよ、mDLの検証者は、証明書が本当に有効な発行機関から発行されたものであることを信頼しなけれ ばならない。この相互作用は、mDLのトランザクション時に発生する必要はない。ISO/IEC 18013-5は、この相互作用をサポートする方法を完全に標準化している。  サーバーの検索方法： このインタラクションは、mDL検証者によって2つの目的で使用される：   デバイス検索方式と同様に、発行局の公開鍵を取得する。  mDLの所有者とmDLを識別するトークンをリアルタイムで発行局に渡し、実際のmDL情報を発行局から受け取ること。ISO/IEC 18013-5は、このインタラクションを記述するインタフェースを完全に標準化している。   <p></p></blockquote><p>ここはデバイスリトリーバルなのかサーバーリトリーバルなのかで異なりますが、mDLリーダーがIssuerへの問い合わせを行うケースについて記載されていますね。いわゆるDIDを使ったVCとの大きな違いはIssuing Authorityが完全に中央集権であることかと思います。（免許なので当然ですね）そのため、検証用の公開鍵を取得する場合は堂々とVerifierからIssuerへのインタラクションが発生しています。（ここは若干プライバシーとのトレードオフはありますが）&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Note that ISO/IEC 18013-5 specifies system interfaces and a certificate exchange method, and on purpose does not address the user interface (e.g. the look, feel and functionality of an mDL app residing on an mDL holder’s device). It is left up to Issuing Authorities (and their implementers) to innovate in this area.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>ISO/IEC 18013-5は、システム・インターフェースと証明書交換方法を規定するものであり、ユーザ・イン ターフェース（例えば、mDL保有者のデバイスに常駐するmDLアプリのルック、フィール、機能性）については、 意図的に触れていないことに留意されたい。この分野での技術革新は、発行局（およびその実装者）に委ねられている。</p></blockquote><p><br></p><p>ということで、本日はここまで。</p><p><br></p>

こんにちは、富士榮です。 <br>  先日、<a href="https://idmlab.eidentity.jp/2024/12/blog-post.html">用語を見た</a>ついでにAAMVAが出しているMobile Drivers License Implementation Guidelines 1.4を読んでいこうと思います。  <br>   <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjjSCs0hVWK7schMxMWxX_jNjarDUUlvDhZPWDkVuJSY_CSHh2gdAgW92RcC-0unJodQBwWYdiJj7Inhz0_So2plM4W9fRQ0xb8dQGFtcXoezjCup5Wn5ll9BxKRxVBW0D-UzCxiuZkmyzJFZXWQb-F6IyfGlYGctpLzkUPnQdVb0mzDjvVKfT_wMRMtF1H"></a> <br>  <a href="https://www.aamva.org/getmedia/8d8fbb1f-1ec0-4b25-89a1-b90c36163edb/mdl-implementation-guidelines-v1-4.pdf">こちら</a>が原文です。  <br>  まずはIntroductionから。 <blockquote> The AAMVA Joint Mobile Driver’s License (mDL) Working Group (WG) has been active around mobile identification since 2012. As the mDL evolves, the mDL WG continues to identify and address topics on which guidance to Issuing Authorities can be helpful. This document represents the bulk of the current guidance, and points to additional resources as needed. </blockquote><blockquote><p>AAMVA 合同モバイル運転免許証（mDL）ワーキンググループ（WG）は、2012 年以来、モバイル ID を中心に活動してきました。mDL の進化に伴い、mDL WG は、発行機関へのガイダンスが役立つトピックを特定し、対処し続けています。この文書は、現在のガイダンスの大部分を示し、必要に応じて追加のリソースを示します。</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The goal of this document is to inform and equip Issuing Authorities, and to some extent mDL verifiers, to achieve the following:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>この文書の目的は、発行局、そしてある程度mDLの検証者に対し、以下のことを達成するための情報を提供し、装備させることです：</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  Technical interoperability between different Issuing Authorities’ mDL programs, i.e., an Issuing Authority being able to read an mDL issued by any other Issuing Authority.  Trust in different Issuing Authorities’ mDLs.  Privacy preserving implementations.&nbsp;  異なる発行局のmDLプログラム間の技術的な相互運用性。つまり、発行局は他の発行局が発行したmDLを読むことができる。  異なる発行局のmDLに対する信頼性  プライバシーの保護  <p></p></blockquote><p>まずは目的からですが、アメリカでは州ごとに免許証を発行しているため、相互運用性は非常に重要になってくる、というところだと思います。&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>It is up to Issuing Authorities to determine the extent to which the guidance in this document is followed.</p><p>Nevertheless, the minimum measures deemed necessary to achieve the above are labeled as mandatory requirements in this document (i.e. “shall” or “must”). A summary of minimum measures can be found in Appendix B.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>本文書のガイダンスにどの程度従うかは、発行当局の判断に委ねられます。とはいえ、上記を達成するために必要とみなされる最低限の対策は、本文書では必須要件（すなわち「しなければならない」または「しなければならない」）と表示されています。最小限の措置の要約は付録Bに記載されています。</p></blockquote><p>先にも書いた通り、州ごとに発行しているのでこのガイドラインの強制力も一定程度にとどまる感じなんですね。確かに後半に出てくるリテンション期間の話や複数枚数の発行の可否などはかなり現場に判断を委ねているところもあります。このあたりは念頭に読み進める必要がありそうです。&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>The following topics are outside the scope of this document:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>以下のトピックは本文書の範囲外です：</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  The identity establishment, management and recordkeeping that precedes the creation of an identity credential.  Responsibilities of mDL verifiers.&nbsp;  </blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  ID クレデンシャルの作成に先立つ、ID の確立、管理、および記録管理。  mDL 検証者の責任。  </blockquote><p>あくまでmDLの発行と管理に関するところがスコープっぽいですね。</p><blockquote><p>This document leverages and expands on ISO/IEC 18013-51 (also available as INCITS/ISO/IEC 18013-5), an international mDL standard. Although ISO/IEC 18013-5 specifies an mDL solution, it was intentionally designed to support any type of mobile identity credential. ISO/IEC 18013-5, as qualified in this document, will therefore enable Issuing Authorities to issue both mobile driver’s licenses and mobile identification cards.</p><p>The term “mDL” as used in this document covers both credential types. Qualifications made in this document also allow for identifying an mDL as being REAL ID compliant or not, and/or as a credential issued under the Enhanced Driver’s License program (“EDL”; see the AAMVA DL/ID Card Design Standard).</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>本文書は、国際 mDL 標準である ISO/IEC 18013-5（INCITS/ISO/IEC 18013-5 としても利用可能）を活用し拡張したものです。ISO/IEC 18013-5 は mDL ソリューションを規定していますが、意図的にあらゆるタイプのモバイル ID クレデンシャルをサポートするように設計されています。このため、本文書で規定する ISO/IEC 18013-5 により、発行機関はモバイル運転免許証とモバイル ID カードの両方を発行できるようになります。</p><p>本文書で使用する「mDL」という用語は、両方のクレデンシャル・タイプをカバーします。この文書で行われる認定は、mDL を REAL ID 準拠かどうか、および／または拡張運転免許証プログラム（「EDL」；AAMVA DL/ID カード設計基準参照）の下で発行されたクレデンシャルとし て識別することも可能にします。</p></blockquote><p>本書はISO/IEC 18013-5がベースであり、モバイル運転免許証とモバイルIDカードの両方を対象に書かれている、というところが肝ですね。そしてやはりリアルID法に関しても視野に入っています。</p><blockquote><p>Additional guidance on mDL administration in the areas of legislation and procurement can be found in two other documents produced by the mDL Working Group. Those are the mDL Model Legislation, and the mDL Procurement Guidance (see the jurisdictional member area on the AAMVA website). AAMVA also conducts regular outreach to stakeholders on the topic of mDL, including town hall meetings, podcasts, and training.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>mDLに関する法律や調達に関するガイダンスは、mDLワーキンググループが作成した2つの文書に記載されています。これらは、「mDLモデル法案」と「mDL調達ガイダンス」です（AAMVAウェブサイトの管轄メンバーエリアを参照）。AAMVAはまた、タウンホールミーティング、ポッドキャスト、トレーニングなど、mDLに関するステークホルダーへの定期的な働きかけも行っています。</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>It should be noted that mDL and related technologies are ever evolving. As a result, this document will continue to be updated to synchronize its content with the latest standards and practices. For this reason, readers of this document are encouraged to periodically check the AAMVA website for new versions.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>mDLと関連技術は常に進化しています。そのため、本書は最新の基準や慣行と内容を同期させるために更新され続けます。このため、本書の読者は、定期的にAAMVAのウェブサイトで新バージョンを確認することが推奨されます。</p><p></p></blockquote><p>AAMVAのウェブサイトを見ると色々な情報が掲載されていますので、このガイドライン以外にも参照すべき情報は多そうです。&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>

<p>As a follow-up to the JSONPath module and playground I released <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/11/go-jsonpath-playground/" title="Introducing RFC 9535 Go JSONPath and Playground">last month</a>,
I’m happy to announce the follow-up project, called JSONTree. I’ve implemented
it in the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/theory/jsontree">github.com/theory/jsontree</a> Go package, and built a <a href="https://webassembly.org" title="WebAssembly">Wasm</a>-powered
browser <a href="https://theory.github.io/jsontree/" title="Go JSONTree Playground">playground</a> for it.</p>
 JSONTree? 
<p>While a <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9535.html" title="RFC 9535 JSONPath: Query Expressions for JSON">RFC 9535 JSONPath</a> query selects and returns an array of values from
the end of a path expression, a JSONTree compiles multiple JSONPath queries
into a single query that selects values from multiple path expressions. It
returns results not as an array, but as a subset of the query input,
preserving the paths for each selected value.</p>
<p>In other words, it compiles multiple paths into a single tree of selection
paths, and preserves the tree structure of the input. Hence JSONTree.</p>
 Example 
<p>Consider this JSON:</p>

</code>  <p>Note that the original data structure remains, but only for the subset of the
structure selected by the JSONPath queries.</p>
 Use Cases 
<p>A couple of use cases drove the conception and design of JSONPath.</p>
 Permissions 
<p>Consider an application in which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access-control_list" title="Wikipedia: Access-control list">ACL</a>s define permissions for groups of users
to access specific branches or fields of JSON documents. When delivering a
document, the app would:</p>
 
 Fetch the groups the user belongs to 
 Convert the permissions from each into JSONPath queries 
 Compile the JSONPath queries into an JSONTree query 
 Select and return the permitted subset of the document to the user 
 
 Selective Indexing 
<p>Consider a searchable document storage system. For large or complex documents,
it may be infeasible or unnecessary to index the entire document for full-text
search. To index a subset of the fields or branches, one would:</p>
 
 Define JSONPaths the fields or branches to index 
 Compile the JSONPath queries into a JSONTree query 
 Select and submit only the specified subset of each document to the
indexing system 
 
 Go Example 
<p>Use the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/theory/jsontree">github.com/theory/jsontree</a> Go package together with
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/theory/jsonpath">github.com/theory/jsonpath</a> to compile and execute JSONTree queries:</p>
  <code>package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/theory/jsonpath"
	"github.com/theory/jsontree"
)

func main() {
	// JSON as unmarshaled by encoding/json.
	value := map[string]any{
		"name":  "Barrack Obama",
		"years": "2009-2017",
		"emails": []any{
			"potus@example.com",
			"barrack@example.net",
		},
	}

	// Compile multiple JSONPaths into a JSONTree.
	tree := jsontree.New(
		jsonpath.MustParse("$.name"),
		jsonpath.MustParse("$.emails[1]"),
	)

	// Select from the input value.
	js, err := json.Marshal(tree.Select(value))
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	fmt.Printf("%#v\n", tree.Select(value))
}
</code>  <p>And the output:</p>
  <code>{"emails":["barrack@example.net"],"name":"Barrack Obama"}
</code>  <p>Note that the index position of the selected email was not preserved. Replace
<code>New</code> with <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/theory/jsontree#NewFixedModeTree" title="github.com/theory/jsontree: NewFixedModeTree"><code>NewFixedModeTree</code></a> to create a “fixed mode” JSONTree that
preserves index positions by filling gaps with <code>null</code>s. Its output of the
above example would be:</p>
  <code>{"emails":[null,"barrack@example.net"],"name":"Barrack Obama"}
</code>   Status 
<p>The public interface of the <code>jsontree</code> module is quite minimal and stable. But
I suspect there may remain some flaws in the merging of JSONPath selectors.
Please report bugs via <a href="https://github.com/theory/jsontree/issues/" title="theory/jsontree: Issues">GitHub issues</a> and I’ll get them fixed up ASAP.</p>
<p>Otherwise, please share and enjoy!</p>

Web security, symbolized<p>Monty Pythons <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnciwwsvNcc">parrot sketch</a> is an all time classic because it plays on a very human experience of being defenseless when someone is just blatantly refusing to acknowledge the obvious. Shared reality is a matter of perception, not objective observation. Supported also by various mental biases, including the sunk cost fallacy, and the desire to agree with people we perceive as sympathetic or competent, virtually all humans can fall into this trap. Technical experts on Self Sovereign Identity included.</p><p>Instead of recognizing that the parrot of Web security is deceased, has gone to meet its maker, is pushing up the daisies, some people keep insisting that it is merely napping, and use trinkets and all kinds of strings and wires to hold it&nbsp;up.</p><p>The result is did:tdw, recently rebranded to did:webvh.</p> Web based DID methods belong to the family of federated identity methods, not Self Sovereign Identity <p>Using the web for Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) violates some of the basic principles of Self Sovereign Identity, and effectively restricts the possible properties of the system to that of a classic federated identity protocol, such as&nbsp;OpenID.</p><p>Federated identity systems have their uses, and are often “good enough” for usage by large corporations and governments. But they also enable and encourage platform strategies, which has dramatic implications for personal usage, as well as Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). The result has been the Surveillance Industry, and a dependency of 95% of our economy on a few, large platform companies.</p><blockquote>Self Sovereign Identity has been developed as a concept to break that dependency, and give people control over their own privacy, security and data. Instead, thanks to did:web and its descendants, it increasingly looks like an exercise of putting SSI lipstick on the pig of the federated Web.</blockquote><p>You may think this is just hyperbole. So let’s go back to the beginning.</p> About the principles of&nbsp;SSI <p>The design goals of Decentralized Identifiers are listed in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#design-goals">Section 1.2 of the W3C DID specificaton</a>:</p>W3C DID: Design goals for Decentralized Identifiers (DID)<p>So how well do Web based DID methods meet these&nbsp;goals?</p><p>All web based methods, including did:web, did:tdw, did:webvh, and any other web based method anyone might ever come up with depend on a domain name pointing to a web server. The method specific identifier is always being transformed into a HTTPS request. The <a href="https://identity.foundation/didwebvh/next/#the-did-to-https-transformation">DID to HTTPS Transformation</a> is the same for did:webvh as it is for&nbsp;<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/#method-specific-identifier">did:web</a>.</p><p>Reaching the correct web server is therefore contingent on access control by the administrator of the web server, the security of the web server, the longevity of the organization operating the web server, the Certificate Authority issuing the certificates identifying the web server, the configuration of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) parameters, and the Domain Name System to identify which web server to&nbsp;contact.</p><p>Users have two&nbsp;choices:</p>  Operate their own web server,&nbsp;or  Use the web server of some organization that provides them their “decentralized” identifier.  <p>The former is the “let them eat cake” of modern technologies.</p><p>Despite many people working for decades to make self-hosting easier and more attractive, self-hosting has been declining. But even if we reverted that trend and enabled and motivated people to self-host with some amazing self-hosting offers: How hard would it be to correlate did:tdw:QmfGEUAcMpzo25kF2Rhn8L5FAXysfGnkzjwdKoNPi615XQ:petermueller.ch to did:tdw:QmdfTbBqBPQ7VNxZEYEj14VmRuZBkqFbiwReogJgS1zR1n:petermueller.ch&nbsp;?</p><p>How difficult would it be to figure out these might both belong to the same person, whose name might be Peter Müller? Especially considering that the web server at petermueller.ch presents a certificate that lists the owner of the certificate to be a “Peter Müller”, and the whois record for the domain lists his full name, address and phone&nbsp;number?</p><p>Which brings us to the second choice, above, which is today’s reality for most people in a federated identity world: Trust the platform intermediary.</p><p>How much decentralization is there in Apple Mail? How decentralized are today’s Certificate Authorities? How much privacy and control do users of Gmail have? How secure are today’s web services? How well does today’s world fare in terms of data protection from compromise and loss? How good is today’s Web security?</p><blockquote>In reality, Web based DID methods give up on Decentralization, Control, Privacy and Security to the same level that today’s federated identity solutions have given up on&nbsp;them.</blockquote><p>They use protocols like OpenID Connect for Verifiable Credentials and Verifiable Presentations (OIDC4VC &amp; OIDC4VP) because they ARE OpenID methods. Which is why if use cases building on top of Web based DIDs were using truth in labelling, they would inform their users about being based on&nbsp;OpenID.</p><p>But much of the technology world thrives on buzzwords and hypes, and too often, the technical reality is obfuscated by layers of technical complexity and marketing. So the market rarely penalises false advertising.</p>did:web(vh), EV&nbsp;edition<p>Using the Web for “Decentralized” Identifiers and advertising it as revolutionary SSI technology is a bit like selling an “Electric Vehicle” that avoids all the complexities of battery development by using a diesel generator on a towed trailer to power the car. Yes, the propulsion is now electric.</p><p>But is the end result fundamentally better than a diesel&nbsp;car?</p> But what about the added security? <p>When reading about did:webvh, one could get the impression a lot of security is being added. In reality, it's mostly added complexity because everything goes over a single channel, the same one that is being used by did:web, as&nbsp;well.</p><blockquote>It adds security in the same way that web sites get more secure if you ask users to enter not a single password, but three passwords, subsequently, in the correct&nbsp;order.</blockquote><p>There is a reason no-one does that. Three passwords are not fundamentally more secure, because there is no additional channel. Add a real second factor, and security actually goes up. Which is why <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication">Multi Factor Authentication (MFA)</a> has been invented.</p><p>Most likely the Web based DID methods can be developed to the point they will provide actual MFA security at a similar level to today’s federated identity protocols. Maybe did:webvh is even close to that&nbsp;point.</p><blockquote>But that only makes it just as secure as “Login with Google”, today. And it does nothing to make it meet the SSI criteria of Decentralization, Control and&nbsp;Privacy.</blockquote><p>Perhaps it is time to acknowledge that this parrot is not just a heavy&nbsp;sleeper.</p> Embrace, Extend, Extinguish <p>So what’s the problem if some people like did:web and its relatives? As long as we are aware of the limitations, and never use it for systems that are supposed to be used in production by end users or SMEs, there is nothing wrong with&nbsp;did:web.</p><p>As I’ve written in a <a href="https://ggreve.medium.com/coming-full-circle-how-self-sovereign-identity-could-lose-its-way-069b480c4399">previous article,</a> it’s really useful for rapid prototyping, and can be used as a placeholder during experimentation before switching to a real Decentralized Identifier. We’ve done so ourselves when <a href="https://vereign.com">Vereign</a> has been working on Proof of Concept for the Swiss health sector in 2023. But once we started working on the production system in 2024, we switched to an Autonomous Identifier (AID) that meets the definition of Self Sovereign Identity.</p><p>The problem starts when people put Web based identifiers into production.</p><p>Not only is it an issue of misleading users with false promises of decentralization, control, privacy and security. It runs much deeper than that. Increasing adoption of Web based identifiers under the moniker of Self Sovereign Identity makes it impossible for actual Self Sovereign Identity to differentiate itself from federated identity protocols. It sucks the air out of the room for actual&nbsp;SSI.</p><blockquote>At a technology strategy level, adoption of Web based identifiers makes SSI susceptible to something it was originally designed to prevent: Platform&nbsp;capture.</blockquote>Depiction of did:web(vh) being welcomed by Self Sovereign Identity community<p>Whether accidentally or by design, the movement for Web based identifiers perfectly executes a strategy coined by Microsoft in the 90s, labelled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend,_and_extinguish">Embrace, Extend, Extinguish</a>. I’ve gotten to study that particular script extensively when coordinating the technical and communication activities of the <a href="https://fsfe.org">Free Software Foundation Europe</a> around the EU Microsoft <a href="https://fsfe.org/activities/ms-vs-eu/ms-vs-eu.en.html">antitrust case</a> in order to obtain much needed interoperability information for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.samba.org/">Samba</a>.</p><p>The script is not super complicated. First, become a champion of Self Sovereign Identity, embrace it visibly, participate in the conferences, champion it at the political level. Then come up with ideas to extend it, for instance by proposing to speed up adoption by falling back on “proven”” technologies from the Web. Provided enough Kool-Aid, nobody might notice that it violates the principles of SSI and you’ll find many willing participants.</p><p>And lastly, once it has become the dominant flavour to however misleadingly claim the label Self Sovereign Identity, extinguish what is left in terms of actual SSI by aggressively using your economic and political might to push a platform play to suck the air out of the market. While Sovrin had its issues, including political, it undoubtedly lived up to all the SSI principles. Recently, the Sovrin Foundation announced that it was <a href="https://idtechwire.com/the-community-moved-on-sovrin-announces-mainnets-likely-shutdown/">shutting down in March 2025</a> due to its community moving to the&nbsp;Web.</p> So, what’s&nbsp;left? <p>Microsoft had originally championed did:ion, a fully Self Sovereign Identifier based on the <a href="https://identity.foundation/sidetree/spec/">Sidetree</a> specification. But as of 2023, it unsurprisingly also <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/verified-id/verifiable-credentials-faq#does-microsoft-entra-verified-id-support-ion-as-its-did-method">switched to did:web</a>. Old habits die hard. Other large tech platforms are also pushing in the same direction, as are several of the former governmental monopolists with strong political ties, such as T-Systems.</p><p>The most promising design for a decentralized identifier is the <a href="https://keri.one/">Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI)</a>, and at conceptual level it solves some very hard problems that no other method even attempts to address. The problem is how long it has been the promising next thing, without achieving sufficient adoption, and without finding its way into the regulatory documents in the European Union <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EIDAS">eIDAS (for “electronic IDentification, Authentication and trust Services”)</a> working group, which is strongly pushing in the direction of Web based identifiers.</p><blockquote>Unsurprisingly, technical experts have raised <a href="https://www.cryptomathic.com/blog/key-vulnerabilities-of-eudi-arf">security</a> and <a href="https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/issues/200">privacy</a> concerns. In fact, it seems the current draft of the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/EUDIGITALIDENTITYWALLET/Technical+Specifications">EU Architecture and Reference Framework (ARF)</a> may be in violation of the EU privacy provisions it is supposed to&nbsp;provide.</blockquote><p>Also, and it’s already been a topic in the <a href="https://ggreve.medium.com/dice-2024-retrospective-b20372f13a65">DICE2024 retrospective</a>, KERI is currently available in Python only. Which leaves adoption hamstrung. Not everyone in the KERI community agrees with that, but I’m aware of a number of people and initiatives who would love to adopt KERI, but not in Python. And its completeness as a concept puts the effort required for implementation in another language outside what is feasible for any of these parties individually.</p><p>So, when looking at the <a href="https://identity.foundation/did-traits/#comparison-of-did-methods">W3C DID Traits</a> draft, the table looks pretty bleak, with two actual SSI methods left on it: did:key and did:peer. Both limited in relation to quite a few use&nbsp;cases.</p> What we ended up&nbsp;doing… <p>We anticipated this picture when designing our use case and solution for the Swiss health sector back in January 2024. The Web identifiers were obvious non-starters, as were did:key and did:peer, due to them being overly limited for our&nbsp;purpose.</p><p>We also did not like the idea of putting Python into a mission critical production application for large number of users. Especially since we did not want to put Python on the phone, and also did not want remote wallets that do not actually live on the&nbsp;phone.</p><p>So we did what XKCD told us <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">not to do</a>. Stay&nbsp;tuned.</p><p>EDIT ON 3. March 2025: The follow-up is finally available at <a href="https://ggreve.medium.com/a-future-for-self-sovereign-identity-c237caa5e46f">https://ggreve.medium.com/a-future-for-self-sovereign-identity-c237caa5e46f</a></p>

<p>BILL VAN ESVELD: This is the first time that we’ve made a finding of genocidal acts in Gaza. It is not an accusation that we level lightly. We have not done this very often in our history. We accused the Myanmar military of genocidal acts against the Rohingya in 2017, and we found full-blown genocide against the Kurds in Saddam Hussein’s Anfal campaign in Iraq in the ’80s — sorry, in the ’90s, and we found genocide against — also in Rwanda in the ’80s. It is, you know, an extremely difficult crime to prove. It is, you know, mass killing deliberately to destroy people because they’re part of the group, not something we level lightly, but, yes, we found it here.</p>

They are issued in a secure process, and include technology that makes travel easier. EDLs are a low-cost, convenient option for entering the United States from Canada, Mexico or the Caribbean through a land or sea port of entry, in addition to serving as a permit to drive.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>強化運転免許証（EDLs）は、自動車で米国国境を越える際に身分証明と米国市民権を証明する州発行の強化運転免許証である。EDLは安全なプロセスで発行され、渡航を容易にする技術も含まれている。EDLは、カナダ、メキシコ、カリブ海諸国から陸路または海路で米国に入国する際に、低コストで便利なオプションであり、運転許可証としての役割も果たす。</p></blockquote><p>使い道としては2025年から施行されるReal ID法（州が発行する運転免許証や身分証明書に対して最低限のセキュリティ基準を定めるもの）に対応したものっぽいです。米国国内で飛行機に乗るときにReal ID法に準拠した身分証明書の提示が必要になる、って話です。（日本人は外国政府発行のパスポートを使うことになると思います）</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>mDL。いわゆるMobile Driver's License、モバイル運転免許証ですね。</p><p>こんな解説が書いてあります。</p><blockquote><p>driver’s license or identification card that resides on a mobile device or requires a mobile device as part of the process to gain access to the related information</p><p>Note to entry: Adapted from ISO/IEC 18013-5</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>運転免許証または身分証明書であって、モバイル・デバイス上に存在するもの、または入国時に 関連情報にアクセスするためのプロセスの一部としてモバイル・デバイスを必要とするもの： ISO/IEC 18013-5 からの引用。</p></blockquote><p>まだ18013-7:2024と18013-5:2021の差分をとれていませんが、AAMVAとしては18013-5ベースです。</p><p><br></p><p>mDL app。いわゆるWalletに当たるものですね。</p><blockquote><p>software running on an mDL holder’s device; within the context of this document this includes a standalone app as well as a wallet type app</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>mDL保持者のデバイス上で動作するソフトウェア。本書の文脈では、スタンドアロン型アプリおよびウォレット型アプリを含む。</p></blockquote><p><br></p><p>mdoc。クレデンシャルフォーマットがmdoc、運転免許証として使えばmDLっていう整理でいいのかと思います。</p><blockquote><p>document or application that resides on a mobile device or requires a mobile device as part of the process to gain access to the document or application</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>モバイル・デバイス上に存在する、または文書やアプリケーションにアクセスするためのプロセスの一部としてモバイル・デバイスを必要とする文書またはアプリケーション</p></blockquote><p><br></p><p>mobile security object。MSOなんて言われたりします。mdocの構造化されたデータセットの話です。中にはデバイスアテステーションなども含まれるのでHolderバインディングの保証をすることが目的とされます。</p><blockquote><p>structured data set that enables an mDL verifier to authenticate (for both accuracy and origin) other mDL data elements received during an mDL transaction</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>mDLベリファイアが、mDLトランザクション中に受信した他のmDLデータエレメントを（正確さと出所の両方について）認証できるようにする構造化データセット</p></blockquote><p><br></p><p>provisioning。これは特殊用語lじゃないのかな？と思うのはIdentity界隈の人だからなのかもしれません。</p><blockquote><p>initial loading of mDL information into an mDL app</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>mDLアプリへのmDL情報の初期読み込み</p></blockquote><p>要するにウォレットへのモバイル運転免許証をインストールすることですね。</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>ということで、まずは用語解説からでした。</p><p>概念を理解するためにもこのあたりはちゃんと押さえておきましょう。&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>

こんにちは、富士榮です。 <br>  先週はTaiwan Digital Identity Wallet International Forumで登壇してきましたので、キーノートとしてお話した内容をメモしておきたいと思います。  イベントについてはこちら  <a href="https://idmlab.eidentity.jp/2024/11/taiwan-digital-wallet-international.html">https://idmlab.eidentity.jp/2024/11/taiwan-digital-wallet-international.html</a>  <br>  <br>   <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgLdUITMo8-0WkN9eDPJPAeSBVYxbJlZtXx7dCVQPLVArTRWr9jbnobZOXl7rVLRBMZkDRDsWJTzXG41M3cu1akZPLKjFhulfjbL3A8QA4ANSNLOPMoyKLb5JHQYoGySeLTNKL0Fi2yS4-4oe5AUIdiDo1cMSDlgvbsWpaGQi1WJdwJULHo-uwAbptt6OO7"></a> 自己紹介は置いておいて、テーマは相互運用性でした。 <blockquote>  As you know, the Digital Identity Wallet has recently become an emerging topic in the digital identity space. For example, the European Committee has started implementing the European Digital Identity Wallet, which allows citizens to bring their own digital identity documents, such as national ID cards or mobile driver's licenses. At the same time, interoperability is essential for adopting these wallets in the real world because we have an existing ecosystem without the digital identity wallet today.  So, today’s my talk is about interoperability between current identity ecosystems and a Digital Identity Wallet.  </blockquote><blockquote><p>ご存知のように、デジタルIDウォレットは最近、デジタルID分野で新たなトピックとなっています。例えば、欧州委員会は欧州デジタルIDウォレットの導入を開始しました。これにより、国民は国民IDカードや携帯電話運転免許証などのデジタルID文書を携帯できるようになります。同時に、現実世界でこれらのウォレットを採用するには相互運用性が不可欠です。なぜなら、今日、デジタルIDウォレットのない既存のエコシステムが存在しているからです。</p><p>そこで、本日の私の講演では、現在のアイデンティティ・エコシステムとデジタル・アイデンティティ・ウォレット間の相互運用性についてお話します。&nbsp;</p></blockquote>  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiA3n4-wCR4DNYo_k3sK3z-I4R5-SaDuVUF8Zslk_xqZDA6GQUZ3Dt2O5q3vc3zXbzT0s-gbMATmbaPywiwnZv57PiofbMYQJU16YjB5906Jmu5j0ehK6xfYS2tUUinvbtqsfrZmYKWpy6s85tSjhZcXSkn_32zVAM0sB0sETtHGtIwRt_IFOPGTSK3_xZb"></a> <br> <blockquote>  First, let’s think about our current situation when considering the term “interoperability.”  Since the fall of the Tower of Babel, we have been living in a world divided by different languages, different tribes, different cultures, and different social systems.  In other words, we have been living in a world where we have not been able to communicate well for a long time. This continued until the Age of Exploration, when trade between countries worldwide became more active.  For people like me who have lived in Asia, we have lived in a world that is very different from Western languages and cultures, and we are still living behind language barriers.  However, since the spread of the Internet began in the 1990s, the breakdown of regional divisions, including countries, has started. We have finally been freed from the constraints of physical location, and the need to communicate globally has arisen.  So, did a technology break down these barriers to allow us to communicate and trade freely globally?  </blockquote><blockquote><p>まず、「相互運用性」という言葉について考える前に、現在の状況について考えてみましょう。</p><p>バベルの塔が崩壊して以来、私たちは異なる言語、異なる部族、異なる文化、異なる社会制度によって分断された世界に生きてきました。</p><p>つまり、私たちは長い間、うまくコミュニケーションを取ることができない世界に生きてきたのです。この状況は、大航海時代を迎え、世界各国間の貿易が活発になるまで続きました。</p><p>私のようにアジアで生活してきた人間にとっては、西洋の言語や文化とはまったく異なる世界で生きてきましたし、今でも言葉の壁に阻まれて生活しています。</p><p>しかし、1990年代からインターネットが普及し始め、国を含めた地域的な区分が崩れ始めました。私たちはようやく物理的な場所の制約から解放され、グローバルにコミュニケーションを取る必要性が生じてきたのです。</p><p>では、こうした障壁を打破し、世界中で自由にコミュニケーションや取引ができるようになった技術は登場したのでしょうか？</p></blockquote>  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEi5y9anTn_NhSR-d4KY5iBnhoJg5ukODYAT_19gYSWnWqoC3GO47P0ybB5WPxL3k3umxO0z8joXuwN0R-OKCXXpfGUk3qUe5P0tEW1JYG2SfB009l6ztXWS8C2Da0P_wZAs7LzTEPlW-7Yy5PPgVfQa7wNNWrAYdS6gJ4HE_S9K7L_LVudbB6qGz3T2KND5"></a> <br><br> <blockquote>  At the moment, the answer is no.  We are currently living in a world divided by silos created by technology.  Even now, to transfer data freely across systems, we have to design and implement interfaces between systems each time, and even when it comes to identity, which is the theme of today's talk, it is still managed on a system-by-system basis. We often have to manage multiple accounts for each systems.  </blockquote><blockquote><p>現時点では、答えはノーです。</p><p>私たちは現在、テクノロジーによって作られたサイロによって分断された世界に生きています。</p><p>今でも、システム間でデータを自由にやりとりするためには、その都度、システム間のインターフェースを設計し実装しなければなりませんし、本日のテーマであるアイデンティティにしても、システムごとに管理されています。 システムごとに複数のアカウントを管理しなければならないこともよくあります。&nbsp;</p></blockquote>  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjc3RHuXPN49Srpkp-ay7jH8qc8-AcVI5zU8YgT-PhPezrvj357_jwm2aj43ei3VTGSKcaxzBEnyZZOe8aL6pWCuYZAbeyMPWoeDoEJIIm8L-ooSZGMOIqh69lVyCfb7M2Dx9RK5wBQwzpRh6BU8Q75DQXhwYUroOMt921Nenn6_UdEjbgwJLLTn52Zarct"></a> <br><br> <blockquote>  We need a way to communicate across countries, jurisdictions, and systems.  And we already know of some examples that have been developed to some extent.  Email can be delivered anywhere in the world without a centralized system, and the telephone system allows us to make calls to people worldwide. In these systems, we can communicate without depending on the email user agent or telephone type.  Also, in the real world, we use passport to identify people on traveling to other countries.  Those of us involved in digital identity need to follow the example of these previous cases and work to create a world where interoperability is guaranteed.    国や管轄区域、システムを越えてコミュニケーションを行う方法が必要です。  そして、ある程度まで開発された例がすでにいくつか存在しています。  電子メールは中央集権的なシステムなしで世界中のどこへでも配信できますし、電話システムは世界中の人々との通話を可能にしています。これらのシステムでは、電子メールユーザーエージェントや電話の種類に依存することなくコミュニケーションを行うことができます。  また現実の世界では、パスポートを使って他国への渡航者の身元確認を行っています。  デジタルアイデンティティに関わる私たちは、これらの過去の事例を手本とし、相互運用性が保証された世界を実現するために取り組む必要があります。  </blockquote><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhslNQ8t7ykKyYZ4KsncE8XYjiqmEZrVn2iEer_BlhMTAjRVDzlVNpybLpv2xlxLlmOx-OvShv6X7a_BC8Vg62RvBnNDAKTYtaGD0Jo4QoJod9GEqlzkPbq3AeKWYqis0TTPbrLnZOOvp3yeWDbXgS4PqaCAcIP1d8rr7Vkge8x19y4qQ1Mfh1rhnIO-W-K"></a> <br><br><p></p><blockquote><p>And digital identities are not just for natural persons. There are various things in the real world, such as IoT devices and legal entities, are connected to the internet, and daily business transactions are carried out. Now is the time to design and implement a system so that all digital identities can be mutually operated with minimal friction.</p> また、デジタルアイデンティティは自然人だけのものではありません。現実世界には、IoTデバイスや法人など、さまざまなものがインターネットに接続され、日常的な商取引が行われています。今こそ、すべてのデジタルアイデンティティが相互に最小限の摩擦で運用できるようなシステムの設計と実装を行うべき時なのです。 </blockquote><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjqKIO8M86eL17l9NBAcUA36CHs6y2pOvo5uw0MnzSg1uwZMtKZcZ18JgGGkt4h1SkX0m4FvDqlNUxIAArC8lT0PHIoKjrQ8JMljwhDR89WXx44XfmhcnzPFvX-MHPFf9Mamjuwasmn4T6Ka2rdUP_7G7HznrDEg5jv0ga1xtQtqD-gIXJgWkmXjdyK5hss"></a> <br><br><p></p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;Let's now take a closer look at interoperability. Even though we use the word 'interoperability,' it can be roughly divided into technical and non-technical aspects. When many engineers talk about interoperability, they often only focus on the technical side, but it is also essential to consider the non-technical side.</p><p>First, let's look at the technical aspects. We must consider the identifier format, transfer protocol, and data model, including the schema and signature algorithm.</p><p>In addition, on the non-technical side, we need to agree on the semantics that expresses what meaning the exchanged data has, the rules and framework within which the data is generated, and the trust framework that ensures the reliability of the entity state, etc.</p><p>Let's take a closer look at each of these elements from the next slide.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>それでは、相互運用性について詳しく見ていきましょう。相互運用性という言葉を使っていますが、大まかに技術的な側面と技術的ではない側面に分けることができます。多くの技術者が相互運用性について語る場合、技術的な側面のみに焦点を当てがちですが、技術的ではない側面も考慮することが不可欠です。</p><p>まず、技術的な側面について見ていきましょう。識別子のフォーマット、転送プロトコル、データモデル（スキーマや署名アルゴリズムを含む）を考慮する必要があります。</p><p>さらに、技術面以外の側面では、交換されたデータがどのような意味を持つのか、データが生成されるルールや枠組み、エンティティの状態の信頼性を確保する信頼フレームワークなどを表現するセマンティクスについて合意する必要があります。</p><p>それでは、これらの要素について、次のスライドから詳しく見ていきましょう。&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhvFDgGZXLcax7V5-cA-q2Q2oXP0vSu_GzbeW3UwM9ZuBw8PXahIh7W7PWksvkZ-tQ8OolqYXGSbHEBSdBIJGZSOVsBpJcH093UlZohL6M7aZW7WUbz8Tm47xtppP-41MPpW8S4saIXVRKfykMWdfrE6qK5uUyXFzfGr_34uvJbuB4wwuDa8on4uckjbwj7"></a> <br><br><p></p><blockquote><p>First of all, let's talk about identifiers. An identifier is an attribute identifying a particular entity within a specific set. This attribute can be a single attribute or multiple attributes.</p><p>The design of the identifier depends on the size of the set that contains the target entity. For example, designing an identifier within a local set differs significantly from creating one within an international or global set. For example, my family name is Fujie, but there may be no one else in this room with the same family name. In this situation, my family name could function as an identifier. However, when I go home to Japan, my family name does not function as an identifier because, as you know, all of my family members have the family name Fujie.</p><p>Finally, it is essential to consider privacy and persistence when considering identifiers. For example, suppose control of an identifier is taken away from you. In that case, there is a possibility that control over the identity information linked to that identifier will also be taken away from you. Also, suppose you are logged in to multiple services using the same identifier. In that case, there is a possibility that the services will collide with each other and merge your attribute information in an unintended way. To deal with such cases, it may be necessary to devise ways to ensure that users use different identifiers.</p><p>On the other hand, if users are not allowed to use the same identifier for an extended period, they may not be able to use the service continuously or may not be able to access past data.</p><p>From the perspective of interoperability, it is necessary to design systems that can correctly identify entities while considering privacy and persistence, not only in the current but also in a broader set in the future.</p><p>Identifiers may seem simple, but they must be designed very carefully.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&nbsp;まず、識別子についてお話しましょう。識別子とは、特定の集合内の特定のエンティティを識別する属性です。この属性は単一の属性であることも、複数の属性であることもあります。</p><p>識別子の設計は、対象のエンティティを含む集合の規模によって異なります。例えば、ローカルな集合内で識別子を設計することは、国際的またはグローバルな集合内で設計することとは大きく異なります。例えば、私の姓は富士榮ですが、この部屋には同じ姓の人は誰もいないかもしれません。このような状況では、私の姓は識別子として機能するでしょう。しかし、私が日本に帰国した場合、ご存知のように私の家族全員が富士榮という姓なので、私の姓は識別子として機能しません。</p><p>最後に、識別子を考える際には、プライバシーと永続性について考慮することが不可欠です。例えば、ある識別子の管理が自分から奪われたとします。その場合、その識別子と紐づけられたID情報についても管理が奪われる可能性があります。また、同じ識別子を使って複数のサービスにログインしているとします。その場合、サービス同士が衝突し、意図しない形で属性情報がマージされてしまう可能性がある。このようなケースに対応するためには、ユーザーに異なる識別子を利用させる工夫が必要となる可能性があります。</p><p>一方で、長期間にわたって同一の識別子を利用できないと、サービスを継続的に利用できなくなったり、過去のデータにアクセスできなくなったりする可能性があります。</p><p>相互運用性の観点では、プライバシーや永続性を考慮しつつ、現在だけでなく将来にわたって、エンティティを正しく識別できる仕組みを設計する必要があります。</p><p>識別子は一見単純に見えるが、非常に慎重に設計しなければいけません。</p></blockquote><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiKAB88-R_zRe_U7x8Bg9R4RIL98VLqqc-BLoHNVl0MNXyFjhF1cCDK02M9KyJRJ0-RYlrHLDylKmnUDAr84p6R5VS_xyn4o4jSORmYaf2BwduEgtainFdpQoF-23OBAj-GottskC-jd0r8qEsZTO0IuLgRjrdsyBGzBenVQKD-3rH1i495lXHsh6P4JvE_"></a> <br>&nbsp;<p></p><blockquote>  Next, we will consider transport protocols. Transport protocols define the methods by which entities communicate with each other. In the context of digital credentials, transport protocols include issuing credentials to wallets, presenting credentials to verifiers, and revoking issued credentials by issuers.  To ensure interoperability, the multiple issuer, wallet, and verifier components must communicate using a method that has been agreed upon in advance.  次に、トランスポートプロトコルについて検討します。トランスポートプロトコルは、エンティティが相互に通信する方法を定義します。デジタルクレデンシャルの文脈では、トランスポートプロトコルには、クレデンシャルをウォレットに発行すること、クレデンシャルをベリファイアに提示すること、発行者によって発行されたクレデンシャルを取り消すことが含まれます。  相互運用性を確保するには、複数の発行者、ウォレット、ベリファイアのコンポーネントが、事前に合意された方法で通信する必要があります。  </blockquote><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjurXoMAA89tiSW9Esp45fMx0C7A7DsZ71iIG-vx3-lbEZ4i8saprScEXHgtmUszZ6vjEFDPLIk_Ma1l07_gpImkTclXvPCq7z6vul9AzK07R5p7HFwu3OCNyWRt6XUnjHpQEPAZ99Bnv1HwIWHxtgC2hVypArM6Y7hg8thjOLDTrp_f-ZNCesuXx3TPtaJ"></a> <br><br><p></p><blockquote><p>Let's also consider data models. Schemas need to take into account the types and namespaces of attributes. Generally, gender is expressed using letters such as M and F, but in some cases, it is expressed using numbers such as 0 and 1. In addition, the attribute name family_name is sometimes used to express the family name, and the attribute name surname is sometimes used. In any case, related entities must agree on the names and types of attributes to achieve interoperability.</p><p>The algorithm used for digital signatures is also a very important factor. In general, it is necessary to verify digital signatures to verify the authenticity of digital credentials. Still, verification will not be possible if the issuer uses a signature algorithm that differs from what the verifier expects.

Let's ask the same question as on the previous page. Just because you have verified the digital signature on the credential you have received, does that mean you can trust the issuer of that credential? For example, if you have obtained the digital data of a graduation certificate with a digital signature, how can you confirm that the university that issued the certificate exists?</p><p>This is where a system called a trust framework comes into play. There are various types of trust frameworks, but general laws and regulations are also a type of trust framework. For example, the recipient of a certificate of qualification may believe that the issuer is operating under the country's laws and regulations that control the bank and that the government regularly audits the bank. In this case, the verifier believes in the laws and regulations of the country, so there is no need to visit the bank to confirm that the individual issuer is an actual bank. In this way, it is possible to reduce the cost of individual verification by designing and operating a system that includes certification and auditing.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>次に、トラストフレームワークについて考えてみましょう。前ページと同じ質問をしてみましょう。受け取ったクレデンシャルに付与された電子署名を検証したからといって、そのクレデンシャルの発行者を信頼できるのでしょうか？例えば、電子署名の付与された卒業証明書の電子データを受け取った場合、その証明書を発行した大学が実在していることをどのように確認できるのでしょうか？</p><p>そこで登場するのが「トラストフレームワーク」と呼ばれる仕組みです。トラストフレームワークにはさまざまな種類がありますが、一般的な法律や規則もトラストフレームワークの一種です。例えば、資格証明書の受領者は、発行者が銀行を管理する国の法律や規則に従って運営されており、政府が定期的に銀行を監査していると考えるかもしれません。この場合、検証者はその国の法律や規制を信頼しているため、個々の発行者が実際に銀行であることを確認するために銀行を訪問する必要はありません。このように、認証と監査を含むシステムを設計・運用することで、個々の検証にかかるコストを削減することが可能となります。&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiGzca6bl5wy7EJ9-gOhZxgZIokb7OcltZlEWAllIDnpylfBVdge4miWc5s1EjC-vpf3VGKC1-yKDIIgx4PPAXUkWMo_rsLoSSsaFazlwZcrvLazs8gKRC5Oj5uFiYbx8ema85rABr84EtFe91jaIlPKeUL7EvEc7yc_Qf9I8N9eIGnr2tzTI1v-efXGmk9"></a> <br><br><p></p><blockquote><p>In a few previous pages, we discussed the need for profiles.

In the real world, we must consider interoperability between these systems.</p><p>In this slide, I want to explain the recent paradigm shift in digital identity systems.</p><p>This diagram shows how the identity paradigm has changed from a centralized world to a decentralized one.</p><p>In the centralized identity system, as I mentioned earlier, it is crucial to manage identity information in the centralized database. However, there are various side effects, such as the need to keep a non-active user account in the database, making license costs expensive. It may cause identity theft attack because nonactive user cannot be aware their identities were stolen since they are not using their accounts.</p><p>Also, a centralized authentication system is quite helpful in gathering sign-in logs. Still, the system's availability is quite crucial because if the system fails, all users cannot log in to all applications.</p><p>On the other hand, in the decentralized identity world, users' identity data is stored in the user's wallet, which is typically installed on smartphones. So, users can bring their identity and authenticate it through their purse, and there is no effect on other users if the user’s wallet is offline.</p><p>In addition, users can aggregate attributes from multiple data sources in a single wallet, aggregate them, and present them to the application. The application can get various attributes from the user’s wallet and determine access permission.</p>  システムアーキテクチャは日々変化しており、複数のアプローチに基づくシステムが共存することは明らかです。現実の世界では、これらのシステム間の相互運用性を考慮する必要があります。  このスライドでは、デジタルIDシステムにおける最近のパラダイムシフトについて説明したいと思います。  この図は、IDのパラダイムが中央集権型から分散型へとどのように変化したかを示しています。  集中型のIDシステムでは、先ほど申し上げたように、ID情報を集中データベースで管理することが重要です。しかし、さまざまな副作用があります。例えば、データベースに非アクティブなユーザーアカウントを維持する必要があるため、ライセンスコストが高額になることがあります。また、非アクティブなユーザーはアカウントを使用していないため、自分のIDが盗まれたことに気づくことができません。そのため、ID盗難の被害に遭う可能性があります。  また、中央集権型の認証システムはサインインログの収集に非常に役立ちます。しかし、システムが故障した場合、すべてのユーザーがすべてのアプリケーションにログインできなくなるため、システムの可用性は非常に重要です。  一方、分散型のアイデンティティの世界では、ユーザーのアイデンティティデータは、通常スマートフォンにインストールされているユーザーの財布に保存されます。そのため、ユーザーは自分のアイデンティティを持ち歩き、財布を通して認証することができます。また、ユーザーの財布がオフラインの状態でも、他のユーザーには影響がありません。  さらに、ユーザーは複数のデータソースから属性を収集し、それを集約してアプリケーションに提示することができます。アプリケーションはユーザーの財布からさまざまな属性を取得し、アクセス許可を決定することができます。  </blockquote><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjjpt2WhbfdLj_-EyePeQi4OFyTwJXxatukt_LD73dpvW8mu9xe8pkI1h_gl0Ug0HFFZPVXJXLkzrZmhRYYRQNnyYM1O4YlE0YxIAg1VQP4Hex10JBiXbjpFX3KsYIGJoKQmDMFMlOVL5w0e3KfSRUgI-1EKK_g61uwBfLdsNrxR9s1l5RgILayabDRn6tT"></a> <br><br><p></p><blockquote><p>We at the OpenID Foundation support the SIDI Hub, a community established to ensure interoperability in global digital identity.

In addition, the learning management system in question was developed based on a middleware called Moodle, and it was necessary to implement a unique API to issue credentials.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>実際の利用事例を一つ紹介したいと思います。</p><p>これは国立情報学研究所の学習歴証明の電子化プロジェクトです。このプロジェクトでは、既存の学習管理システムから発行される学習記録をウォレットに発行し、その資格情報を論文投稿時などの資格証明に利用します。</p><p>このプロジェクトを実施するにあたっての課題は、日本に限らず多くの学術システムがSAMLプロトコルを使用しており、日本でも学認という学術フェデレーションのエコシステム内で多くのSAMLベースのIDシステムが稼働していることでした。また、対象の学習管理システムはMoodleというミドルウェアをベースに開発されており、独自のAPIを実装してクレデンシャルを発行する必要がありました。</p></blockquote><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgqowi_IT205Q-vXWV1nX28fwx7lfyN7oDpHOPwhqDKpxRyxWJRjvZLj-YRTN7UiRAzLNHwVJfFeA3dmi4fYHwmEyweM9d-Ae7U870a12dddkpvOlqp3HWcNv0aM3mtBuAYlN7UlNjdYIj38ZcNf6g9ye3BzaOe85bgQJwYpLxABXBpiCUaJxcsU4m0wf7c"></a> <br><br><p></p><blockquote><p>This diagram shows an overview of the GakuNin ecosystem that we explained earlier.</p><p>The National Institute of Informatics provides the trust framework, and certified universities and research institutions' identity providers and certified applications such as learning management systems and research databases are deployed as relying parties within the ecosystem.</p><p>By being authenticated by the university or institution's identity provider, students and researchers can securely single sign-on to many applications, creating a very convenient and secure environment.</p>  この図は、先に説明した学認エコシステムの概要を示しています。  国立情報学研究所がトラストフレームワークを提供し、認定を受けた大学や研究機関のアイデンティティプロバイダーと、学習管理システムや研究データベースなどの認定済みアプリケーションが、エコシステム内の依拠当事者として展開されています。  学生や研究者は、大学や機関のアイデンティティプロバイダーによって認証されることで、多くのアプリケーションに安全にシングルサインオンでき、非常に便利で安全な環境を実現できます。  </blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiMIkaRuffCDf8U3HHvKFISQJGLiDuUoHEbLrXSErhWvWItGkSRSy_xg8DFgOWHtdwuzktFfT2aodwVxZCprmp-PSXtCauD3kWqJ72YAogBsZYHr95FvkFOYbKAZHgccLxs41NHG0xJOKVuPTCR3BiDC5KdYdVc-DKmQ1mznJeb1qEDtISQJC1h8fgQlS30"></a> <br><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>We decided to introduce a wallet-based system into this federated environment.</p><p>For this reason, we took these approaches to the challenge of interoperability.</p><p>First, we embedded the OpenBadge credential the Learning Management System issued using its own API into the Verifiable Credential. We placed a gateway service between Moodle and the wallet and constructed it as an issuer that issues verifiable credentials based on the OpenBadge issued by Moodle. In other words, from the wallet's point of view, the gateway service appears as an Issuer.</p><p>Secondly, the Verifiable Credential presented by the wallet was embedded inside the SAML assertion. Since the existing Relying Party supports the SAML protocol, it was impossible to show the Verifiable Credential directly. Therefore, the OpenBadge extracted from the Verifiable Credential was embedded as one of the attributes inside the SAML assertion, and the credential was presented to the Relying Party. To achieve this, we developed a Wallet to SP Connector component. We configured it to appear as a Verifier to the Wallet and an Identity Provider to the Relying Party.</p><p>Of course, the Relying Party still needs to implement the appropriate logic to extract the OpenBadge from the SAML assertion, verify it, and use it. Still, there was no need to modify to support new protocols such as OpenID for Verifiable Presentation.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>この統合環境にウォレットベースのシステムを導入することを決定しました。</p><p>そのため、相互運用性の課題に対して、以下のアプローチをとりました。</p><p>まず、LMSが独自のAPIを利用して発行するOpenBadgeクレデンシャルを、検証可能なクレデンシャルに埋め込みました。Moodleとウォレットの間にゲートウェイサービスを配置し、Moodleが発行するOpenBadgeに基づいて検証可能なクレデンシャルを発行する発行者として構築しました。つまり、ウォレットから見ると、ゲートウェイサービスは発行者として表示されます。</p><p>次に、ウォレットが提示した検証可能なクレデンシャルはSAMLアサーション内に埋め込まれました。既存のリライングパーティはSAMLプロトコルをサポートしているため、検証可能なクレデンシャルを直接提示することはできません。そのため、検証可能なクレデンシャルから抽出したOpenBadgeをSAMLアサーション内の属性の1つとして埋め込み、リライングパーティにクレデンシャルを提示しました。これを実現するために、私たちは Wallet to SP Connector コンポーネントを開発しました。 Wallet に対してはベリファイアとして、また、リライングパーティに対してはアイデンティティプロバイダーとして表示されるように構成しました。</p><p>もちろん、リライングパーティは、SAML アサーションから OpenBadge を抽出し、それを検証し、使用するための適切なロジックを実装する必要があります。それでも、OpenID for Verifiable Presentation などの新しいプロトコルをサポートするために修正する必要はありませんでした。&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhhiK-H70IUy-2lphu2saFh89mZq0zRuJouHar_JAvWxtRrpMN4tM7s32bN7_pj22MoO70uUNrNYtNJ5rhLgEBNb_rLnhAV_j0lEwdgCKYEAM6JnkC-QD7923lmJUhGw5rtJkC7qb9TxAynfG_QLiPBN4d0p67CubAzZz8JAoh_Hzbc1d5VyGhV1Xz2faxS"></a> <br><br><p></p><blockquote><p>This is an overview of the system.</p><p>First, the user issues a badge using the Learning Management System. At this point, the user is authenticated using the existing Identity Provider.</p><p>Next, the badge is issued to the user's wallet. When the user accesses the gateway, the gateway is also federated with the same Identity Provider as the Learning Management System, and the user is prompted for authentication. This way, the user is granted the appropriate permissions to execute the Moodle API. The gateway service then performs the Moodle API to obtain the issued badge and generate a verifiable credential. The gateway then issues the verifiable credential to the user's wallet as the issuer.</p><p>The issuance is now complete.</p><p>Finally, let's look at the presentation. In this case, we want to present the credential to the Gakunin RDM research database, but Gakunin RDM only supports the SAML protocol so we will use the Wallet to SP Connector. When the user accesses a specific page on Gakunin RDM, Gakunin RDM uses the SAML protocol to start the Wallet to SP Connector. This is the same operation as a standard SAML-based federation, so it is very easy to implement. When the Wallet to SP Connector is started, it requests the user's wallet to present a verifiable credential per the OpenID for Verifiable Presentation protocol. When the user presents the credential in their purse, the Wallet to SP Connector verifies the signature of the credential, extracts the embedded badge information from the credential, and configures it as a SAML assertion, then sends it to Gakunin RDM using the SAML protocol.</p><p>This allows Gakunin RDM to obtain the desired learning credential information, which can then be used to perform access control and other processing.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>以下にシステムの概要を示します。</p><p>まず、ユーザーは学習管理システムを使用してバッジを発行します。この時点で、ユーザーは既存のアイデンティティプロバイダを使用して認証されます。</p><p>次に、バッジがユーザーのウォレットに発行されます。ユーザーがゲートウェイにアクセスすると、ゲートウェイも学習管理システムと同じアイデンティティプロバイダとフェデレーションされており、ユーザーに認証が求められます。これにより、ユーザーにはMoodle APIを実行する適切な権限が付与されます。次に、ゲートウェイサービスがMoodle APIを実行して発行済みのバッジを取得し、検証可能な資格情報を生成します。次に、ゲートウェイが発行者として、検証可能な資格情報をユーザーのウォレットに発行します。</p><p>これで発行は完了です。</p><p>最後に、プレゼンテーションについて見てみましょう。このケースでは、学認RDM研究用データベースにクレデンシャルを提示したいのですが、学認RDMはSAMLプロトコルしかサポートしていないので、Wallet to SP Connectorを使用します。ユーザーが学認RDM上の特定のページにアクセスすると、学認RDMはSAMLプロトコルを使用してWallet to SP Connectorを開始します。これは標準的なSAMLベースのフェデレーションと同じ操作なので、実装は非常に簡単です。Wallet to SP Connectorが起動すると、OpenID for Verifiable Presentationプロトコルに従って、ユーザーのウォレットに検証可能なクレデンシャルの提示を要求します。ユーザーが財布内のクレデンシャルを提示すると、Wallet to SP Connectorはクレデンシャルの署名を検証し、クレデンシャルから埋め込みのバッジ情報を抽出し、それをSAMLアサーションとして構成し、SAMLプロトコルを使用して学認RDMに送信します。</p><p>これにより、学認RDMは必要な学習クレデンシャル情報を取得でき、アクセス制御やその他の処理に使用できるようになります。&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgau6fIEPYKGurnBK6dhvh04y9UPBo-xmcnP6X004UVGvSmWIxQ88HUGurZNWicYm1nT34kxNtfvd-XciYT6pgQg4UceunyKCXp8zoc_TaxZlA2VeEjkc8rfNpwtA_2TcstBvS40KumqVvOe3Chuj4UooA7Igdtlh6k3D7sbAEicyfSgYonpWhXSNYYT1lk"></a> <br><p></p><p><br></p><blockquote><p>We will also introduce activities that address other non-technical considerations.</p><p>Open Identity Exchange is working to map the trust frameworks of each country and identify differences.</p><p>For example, this will enable the EU to understand what rules were used to issue the credentials issued by Japan and to determine whether additional measures are necessary.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>また、技術以外の考慮事項に対処する活動についても紹介します。</p><p>Open Identity Exchangeは、各国の信頼フレームワークをマッピングし、相違点を特定する作業を行っています。</p><p>例えば、これによりEUは、日本が発行したクレデンシャルを発行する際にどのような規則が用いられたかを理解し、追加の措置が必要かどうかを判断することができます。</p></blockquote><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhDFjscYoiOWigxm93OXMFSWREtQZTLepeNIH8el6Z9jnUykMh8LncWZCuiN0OPLfIMgxQTaplNvL-av8lycqfrlsuLbDNIwldX5sbe-Y4zNctT7gwrdOYcrTRwCqL5siP5yIiYtwZCfXsCm8OODNoIvyHYhiZRyD202nbffUGDTr0vzflTctniFppbVL4G"></a> <br><br><p></p><blockquote><p>There are also activities in the academic world to map frameworks related to qualification levels.</p><p>In the academic world, there are two main types of credentials: micro-credentials, mainly learning records, and macro-credentials, which are qualifications such as degrees and credits.</p><p>While micro-credentials are becoming increasingly digitized, as in the case of the NII example mentioned earlier, OpenBadge, it is tough to standardize the difficulty of skills. I think this will continue to be a challenge. On the other hand, about macro-credentials, UNESCO has established standards for skill levels so that each country can define levels based on these standards.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>学術界でも、資格レベルに関連する枠組みをマッピングする活動があります。</p><p>学術界では、主に学習記録であるマイクロ資格と、学位や単位などの資格であるマクロ資格の2つの主要な資格があります。</p><p>マイクロ・クレデンシャルは、先ほど例に挙げたNIIのOpenBadgeのように、どんどんデジタル化が進んでいますが、スキルの難易度をどう標準化するかは難しい。これは今後も課題になっていくと思います。一方、マクロ・クレデンシャルについては、ユネスコが技能レベルの基準を定めており、各国がそれをベースにレベルを定義できるようになっています。</p></blockquote><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEj_tIiMKI14xnhqQfZachoYstaGE3B9oGpbrDM885MsBdREw2gu_SU24bgJNusgWSJWVoZALBfesb4i_rIjV6KIivOZsjHQnBvbCwTltwpe2p4Tjz1fZ6kzcmomNvBS0P2KnK1x0ur64KfBjIVKeb0xm7T4uRDhhnDSNTSkeYSc0UYEHb-ZCDVrYIbgZ2vU"></a> <br>&nbsp;<p></p><blockquote><p>This is the approach to global standards and mapping as defined by UNESCO.</p><p>In this example, the EQF developed by Europe based on UNESCO standards is mapped to the frameworks of other countries.</p><p>For example, EQF Level 4 is mapped to Country X Level 5 and Country Y Level 3.</p><p>これは、ユネスコが定義するグローバルスタンダードとマッピングへのアプローチです。</p><p>この例では、ユネスコの基準に基づいてヨーロッパが開発したEQFが、他の国のフレームワークにマッピングされています。</p><p>例えば、EQFレベル4は、国Xのレベル5および国Yのレベル3にマッピングされています。</p></blockquote><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhixiO4yGRKxUsq-xA-pbgNoo967OlFkUbSg1wBOH1Q8K8NgiI6D7pQTxCYDv45Tf8BueK3qjPJnAj-TdKNzgCgVakI_9ijuj92Huv9J-33-PUTFictKCwnb3EBDe_2qLAJZPQbeLnAtdz8TPvt5wQEylxjUd39pea6zQr3Lif6oQcdKHQGV9Thp2J--GVa"></a> <br><br><p></p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;In addition, we will introduce some of the activities that have been taking place in Japan recently.</p><p>Trusted Web has been underway since 2020, and research into digital identity wallets is being carried out.

It is essential to reach agreement on technical matters such as identifiers, transport protocols, and data models. I also explained that semantics and trust frameworks are necessary from a non-technical perspective.</p><p>I also explained that we need to respond to the recent paradigm changes of identity systems. To introduce a wallet-based system into a federation-type system that has been used in the past, it is thought that it will be necessary to use components such as proxies and gateways temporarily. I also mentioned that by comparing trust frameworks, it will be possible to clarify what additional processing the systems require to be connected.</p><p>In the future, we will need to connect many systems to overcome the silo-based society that has continued since the fall of the Tower of Babel. I hope that we can continue to have discussions like this with everyone.</p><p>Thank you.</p>  最後にまとめます。  まず、相互運用性は技術的な問題と、ルールやフレームワークなどの技術的でない考慮事項の両方を含んでいます。識別子、通信プロトコル、データモデルなどの技術的な事項について合意に達することが不可欠です。また、技術的でない観点からは、セマンティクスや信頼フレームワークが必要であることを説明しました。  また、アイデンティティシステムの最近のパラダイム変化に対応する必要があることを説明しました。これまで使われてきたフェデレーション型システムに、ウォレット型システムを導入するには、プロキシやゲートウェイなどのコンポーネントを一時的に使用する必要があると考えられます。また、信頼フレームワークを比較することで、システムを接続するためにどのような追加処理が必要かを明確にできることを述べました。  今後は、バベルの塔の崩壊以来続いてきた縦割り社会を乗り越えるためにも、多くのシステムを接続していく必要があります。今後も皆さんとこのような議論を続けていければと思います。  ありがとうございました。  </blockquote><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>プロンプターが欲しかったプレゼンでした・・・&nbsp;</p><p>ちなみに始まる前にオープンニングトークをしてくれた台湾のデジタル副大臣（私の左側）と登壇者全員で記念写真を撮りました。なんかセレモニーみたいでいいですね。</p><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgcqOC1PiECCsjXoKm676xGTTtf0y9y7V1_ccAgwKlVQJ4RbIQ5uMIyZ5QKyU86iHUMqMOxnFp_XdA08Ub_RsSB_OqgX0i5C7ygmUxCNud79kLCNQKp9kOd275ASi3rOz50vMcufhsBLkpUvwWVUowYVSIZEUzbORE7a1rHstID1qxflxcQNm-89EeeeRGA"></a> <br><br><p></p><br><p></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>

The settings configured in the portal must align with those in the Auth0 identity provider. The Entra External ID OIDC client would work with most IDPs, since standard OpenID Connect is used.</p>



<p></p>







<p></p>



<p>The corresponding client configuration was created in Auth0:</p>







<p></p>



<p>The Auth0 client in this setup returns the email in the name claim. This must match in the claim mapping in Entra External ID. The email claim is switched to use the name claim. Depending on the mappings, different claim mappings are required. The values are read from the id_token.</p>







<p></p>



<p>The correct callback URLs MUST be set on the Auth0 client configuration. Entra External ID requires the following redirectly URLs:</p>


  https://&lt;tenant-subdomain&gt;.ciamlogin.com/&lt;tenant-ID&gt;/federation/oauth2

https://&lt;tenant-subdomain&gt;.ciamlogin.com/&lt;tenant-subdomain&gt;.onmicrosoft.com/federation/oauth2
  


<p></p>



<p>The values are added to the Auth0 client. See the Entra External ID <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/external-id/customers/how-to-custom-oidc-federation-customers#set-up-your-openid-connect-identity-provider">docs</a>.</p>







<p></p>



<p>Once the OpenID Connect client is setup, the identity provider can used in the Entra External ID user flow. Select the required user flow:</p>







<p></p>



<p>And select the Identity Providers and add the OpenID connect IdP.</p>







<p></p>



<p>To test, an <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/EntraExternalIdCiam">ASP.NET Core application</a> using Microsoft.Identity.Web was implemented to authenticate against Entra External ID. When the user is redirected the authenticate, the sign-in with Auth0 option is displayed.</p>







<p></p>



 Notes 



<p>This works well, but setting up the mappings can be difficult if you don’t know the mapping. With this it is possible now to use identities from almost any identity provider. </p>

<p>I’m writing to highly recommend the article “<a href="https://connect2id.com/blog/how-to-link-an-app-protocol-to-an-openid-federation-trust-layer">How to link an application protocol to an OpenID Federation 1.0 trust layer</a>” by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vladimirdzhuvinov/">Vladimir Dzhuvinov</a>.  In it, he defines two kinds of integrity for Federations, and describes how to achieve them:</p>
 
 Federation Integrity, which is defined as: 
<blockquote><p>
This ensures mutual trust between two entities is established always from a common trust anchor. Any resolved metadata and policies that govern the client application and the OpenID provider in a transaction will then fall under the rules of the same federation and thus will be aligned and consistent with one another.
</p></blockquote>
 Metadata Integrity, which is defined as: 
<blockquote><p>
It ensures the trust chains for an entity to a given trust anchor will invariably result in consistent metadata and policies. The natural way to achieve this is for the federation topology under a trust anchor to form a tree. Topologies that lead to multiple paths from a leaf entity to a trust anchor are to be avoided.
</p></blockquote>
 
<p>The article also explores how application protocols, such as <a href="https://openid.net/connect">OpenID Connect</a> or digital <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-wallet-1_0.html">wallet protocols</a>, can achieve those properties in practice (and when they do and don’t need to).</p>
<p>Finally, I’ll note that, as a result of Vladimir’s and others’ thinking about the topic, we just added a section on <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-1_0-41.html#name-federation-topologies">Federation Topologies</a> to the OpenID Federation specification, which provides concrete guidance on how to achieve Metadata Integrity.</p>
<p>I’ll stop here so as not to repeat all the useful content in Vladimir’s article.  By all means, <a href="https://connect2id.com/blog/how-to-link-an-app-protocol-to-an-openid-federation-trust-layer">give it read</a>!</p>

<p>This article looks at setting up an ASP.NET Core application to use Azure Key Vault. When deployed to Azure, it works like in the Azure documentation but when working on development PCs, some changes are required for a smooth developer experience. </p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/UsingAzureKeyVaultInDevelopment">https://github.com/damienbod/UsingAzureKeyVaultInDevelopment</a></p>



<p>I develop using Visual Studio and manage multiple accounts and test environments. However, I frequently encounter access errors when using DefaultAzureCredentials. These errors typically occur because the account and tenant do not match the filter set in Visual Studio, or the user lacks access to the tenant. This issue arises often:</p>







<p></p>



<p>The problem can be resolved by using an application client secret to access the Azure Key Vault, implemented with the ChainedTokenCredential. The access client can be specified in the project’s user secrets, allowing it to function independently of the user account and the last filter used in Visual Studio. To set this up, a new Azure App registration was created, and a client secret was added. This client secret is then included in the dotnet user secrets for the project.</p>







<p></p>



<p>A Role assignment was added to the Azure Key Vault for the application service principal, and the necessary access role was configured. With the correct configuration in the user secrets on the development PC, the application can access the Azure Key Vault. This setup eliminates the need for Azure RBAC changes for each developer.</p>







<p></p>



 Setup local development credentials 



<p>The following Nuget packages can be used to integrate a Key Vault client in an ASP.NET Core application. Depending on how the client is setup, or what data is used from the Key Vault, different packages can be used.</p>



 
 Azure.Extensions.AspNetCore.Configuration.Secrets 



 Azure.Identity 



 Azure.Security.KeyVault.Certificates 



 Azure.Security.KeyVault.Secrets 
 



<p></p>



<p>A ChainedTokenCredential is used to access the Key Vault, preventing the access issues associated with DefaultAzureCredential. In local development, a client credential is used via a secret, which can be stored in the dotnet user secrets. When a new developer joins the team, these user secrets can be shared, eliminating the need to modify Azure Key Vault RBAC settings for each new developer. This setup is ideal for development, as it avoids problems caused by incorrect tenants or user accounts in Visual Studio. For production or other deployments, a system-assigned managed identity is used.</p>


  using Azure.Identity;

namespace DevelopmentAspNetCoreKeyVault;

public static class AppAccessCredentials
{
    public static ChainedTokenCredential GetChainedTokenCredentials(IConfiguration configuration, bool isDevelopment)
    {
        if (!isDevelopment)
        {
            // Use a system assigned managed identity on production deployments
            return new ChainedTokenCredential(new ManagedIdentityCredential());
        }
        else // dev env
        {
            var tenantId = configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("EntraId:TenantId", string.Empty);
            var clientId = configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("EntraId:ClientId", string.Empty);
            var clientSecret = configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("EntraId:ClientSecret", string.Empty);

            var options = new TokenCredentialOptions
            {
                AuthorityHost = AzureAuthorityHosts.AzurePublicCloud
            };

            if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(tenantId)) // DevOps
            {
                // Use DefaultAzureCredential if AzureCliCredential is not used in your DevOps
                return new ChainedTokenCredential(new AzureCliCredential());
            }

            // https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.identity.clientsecretcredential
            var devClientSecretCredential = new ClientSecretCredential(
                tenantId, clientId, clientSecret, options);

            var chainedTokenCredential = new ChainedTokenCredential(devClientSecretCredential);

            return chainedTokenCredential;
        }
    }
}
  


<p></p>



<p>The user secrets would have something like this:</p>


  {
  "EntraId": {
    // aspnetcore-keyvault-development-access
    "TenantId": "--tenant_id--",
    "ClientId": "--client_id--",
    "ClientSecret": "--secret--"
  }
}
  


<p></p>



 Using Key Vault directly in the application 



<p>The secret from the Azure Key Vault can be used directly in the code by using the SecretClient class from Azure.Identity. The AppAccessCredentials is used to return the chained credentials and the application is authenticated if the service principal from the App registration has the correct RBAC.</p>


  // Azure SDK direct
var client = new SecretClient(new Uri(_configuration["AzureKeyVaultEndpoint"]!),
    AppAccessCredentials.GetChainedTokenCredentials(_configuration,
        _hostEnvironment.IsDevelopment()));

var secret = await client.GetSecretAsync("demosecret");
DemoSecret = secret!.Value.Value;
  


<p></p>



 Using Key Vault as a configuration 



<p>The AddAzureKeyVault method can be used to use the Azure Key as a further configuration option. I like this as all configuration is abstracted with the IConfiguration interface in the application. The AddAzureKeyVault takes the chained credential as a param.</p>


  var keyVault = builder.Configuration["AzureKeyVaultEndpoint"];
if(!string.IsNullOrEmpty(keyVault))
{
    builder.Configuration.AddAzureKeyVault(
    new Uri($"{builder.Configuration["AzureKeyVaultEndpoint"]}"),
    AppAccessCredentials.GetChainedTokenCredentials(builder.Configuration,
        builder.Environment.IsDevelopment()));
}
  


<p>The secret can be read anywhere in the code using the IConfiguration interface. This can be used in different ways and provides type safe ways of using the properties.</p>


  // ASP.NET Core configuration
// From from key vault using ASP.NET Core configuration integration
// Or from user secrets if offline, or fast startup is required
DemoSecretConfig = _configuration["demosecret"];
  


<p></p>



 Using user secrets for local development 



<p>Sometimes, you need to work offline or frequently restart the application. Constantly connecting to Azure Key Vault can slow down development. In such cases, it’s often more efficient to use dotnet user secrets instead of Azure Key Vault.</p>



 Note 



<p>This is a good and simple approach for developing applications which use Azure Key Vault. You can use a local key management system or whatever local developers use. The client secret should not be used in production deployments as the secret expires and there are better ways to secure the access for the application to Key Vault. System assigned managed identity is the best way to implement application access in Azure in production environments.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://openid.net/wg/connect/">OpenID Connect working group</a> recently adopted three new specifications that build upon and provide new capabilities to <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-1_0.html">OpenID Federation</a>.  But I’m not only happy about these because of the engineering benefits they bring.</p>
<p>I’m particularly happy because they bring new active contributors to the work, specifically <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-f-1495aa133/">Michael Fraser</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/%C5%82ukasz-jaromin-54355647/">Łukasz Jaromin</a>, as well as continuing the strong work by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/giuseppe-de-marco-bb054245/">Giuseppe De Marco</a>, who’s become a leader in the space.  They’re also supported by a few veterans: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rolandhedberg/">Roland Hedberg</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ve7jtb/">John Bradley</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/selfissued/">yours truly</a>, plus now the full OpenID Connect working group.</p>
<p>Here’s the three new specifications, along with an abstract for each of them:</p>
<p>1.  <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-extended-listing-1_0.html">OpenID Federation Extended Subordinate Listing</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
This specification acts as an extension to OpenID Federation 1.0. It outlines methods to interact with a given Federation with a potentially large number of registered Entities, as well as mechanisms to retrieve multiple entity statements along with associated details in a single request.
</p></blockquote>
<p>2.  <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-wallet-1_0.html">OpenID Federation Wallet Architectures</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
As digital wallets become increasingly deployed for managing identity credentials, establishing an architecture for trusted communication is required to allow each participant in the ecosystem to evaluate other participants’ compliance with mutual trust frameworks and accomplish secure and trusted transactions.</p>
<p>This specification defines how to use OpenID Federation 1.0 to enhance the security and interoperability of wallet ecosystems, facilitating trust establishment among the parties and enabling secure metadata exchange and policy application across large scale deployments. It outlines the general architecture of a federated trust infrastructure for wallet ecosystems, identifying participant roles and describing the use of those roles.
</p></blockquote>
<p>3.  <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-rp-metadata-choices-1_0.html">OpenID Connect Relying Party Metadata Choices</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
This specification extends the OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration 1.0 specification to enable RPs to express a set of supported values for some RP metadata parameters, rather than just single values. This functionality is particularly useful when Automatic Registration, as defined in OpenID Federation 1.0, is used, since there is no registration response from the OP to tell the RP what choices were made by the OP. This gives the OP the information that it needs to make choices about how to interact with the RP in ways that work for both parties.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks to the members of the OpenID Connect working group who helped refine them before adoption, and are now working on progressing them in the working group.</p>

<p>One of the wonderful, yet also daunting, aspects of being in the Identity industry is realizing just how far-reaching and all-encompassing its scope and boundaries are. It’s why we need more than just technologists and standards wonks engaged in driving the future of this industry. I’ve been on stage at Identiverse and other conferences for many years challenging the Identirati to bring in people from other fields like User Experience Research, Law, Privacy, and more.</p>



<p>This is the challenge that the <a href="https://digitalidadvancement.org/">Digital Identity Advancement Foundation</a> has taken on. You can check out how they are doing this on their website, via the Kim Cameron Award and the Vittorio Bertocci Award. Thanks to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arynn-crow-821761103/">Arynn Crow</a>, I had the chance to spend some time chatting with the 2024 Kim Cameron award winner, legal scholar <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/grace-klutke-3ba8a1228/">Grace Klutke</a>, at Authenticate 2024. We talked (in my usual rambling sort of way) about ethics in Identity, and the broader impact on human rights, inclusion, and access (in the human and not the technical Authorization sense). You can read her reflection on her experience at the conference <a href="https://digitalidadvancement.org/news/2024-kim-cameron-awardee-reflections-grace-klutke/">here</a>.</p>



<p>Oh, and <a href="https://digitalidadvancement.org/donate/">support DIAF</a> if you can. They’re doing good, and necessary, work!  If DIAF continues to bring smart, talented, and motivated individuals like her from other fields into our industry, then we’ll be doing it right.</p>

<p>Several weeks ago, I started <a href="https://postgr.es/m/2CAD6FA7-DC25-48FC-80F2-8F203DECAE6A%40justatheory.com">a pgsql-hackers thread</a> proposing a new
extension file organization and a search path <a href="https://pgpedia.info/g/guc.html" title="GUC - Grand Unified Configuration">GUC</a> for finding extensions.
The <a href="https://postgr.es/m/E7C7BFFB-8857-48D4-A71F-88B359FADCFD@justatheory.com">discussion</a> of <a href="https://www.df7cb.de">Christoph Berg</a>’s <a href="https://commitfest.postgresql.org/50/4913/"><code>extension_destdir</code> patch</a>
inspired this proposal. These threads cover quite a lot of territory, so I
want to pull together a more unified, public proposal.</p>
<p>Here goes.</p>
 Challenges 
<p>A number of challenges face extension users, thanks to extension file
organization in the Postgres core. The common thread among them is the need to
add extensions without changing the contents of the Postgres installation
itself.</p>
 Packager Testing 
<p>On Debian systems, the user account that creates extension packages lacks
permission to add files to Postgres install. But testing extensions requires
installing the extension where Postgres can find it. Moreover, extensions
ideally build against a clean Postgres install; adding an extension in order
to run <code>make installcheck</code> would pollute it.</p>
<p><a href="https://commitfest.postgresql.org/50/4913/">Christoph’s patch</a> solves these problems by adding a second lookup
path for extensions and dynamic modules, so that Postgres can load them
directly from the package build directory.</p>
<p>Alas, the patch isn’t ideal, because it simply specifies a prefix and appends
the full <code>pg_config</code> directory paths to it. For example, if <code>--sharedir</code>
outputs <code>/opt/share</code> and <code>extension_destdir</code> GUC is set to <code>/tmp/build/myext</code>,
the patch will search in <code>/tmp/build/myext/opt/share</code>. This approach works for
the packaging use case, which explicitly uses full paths with a prefix, but
would be weird for other use cases.</p>
<p>Peter Eisentraut proposed an <a href="https://postgr.es/m/0d384836-7e6e-4932-af3b-8dad1f6fee43@eisentraut.org">alternate patch</a> with a new <code>GUC</code>,
<code>extension_control_path</code>, that provides a more typical search path pattern to
find extension control files, but doesn’t account for shared modules that ship
with an extension, requiring that they still live in the
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-client.html#GUC-DYNAMIC-LIBRARY-PATH"><code>dynamic_library_path</code></a>. Installing into custom directories requires the
undocumented <code>datadir</code> and <code>pkglibdir</code> variables:</p>
  <code>make install datadir=/else/where/share pkglibdir=/else/where/lib
</code>  <p>This pattern can probably be simplified.</p>
 OCI Immutability 
<p><a href="https://opencontainers.org" title="Open Container Initiative">OCI</a> (née Docker) images are immutable, while a container image runs on a
writeable but non-persistent file system. To install persistent extensions in
a container, one must create a persistent volume, map it to
<code>SHAREDIR/extensions</code>, and copy over all the extensions it needs (or muck with
<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/ongres/postgres-extensions-in-kubernetes?slide=14" title="Postgres Extensions in Kubernetes: StackGres">symlink magic</a>). Then do it again for shared object libraries (<code>PKGLIBDIR</code>),
and perhaps also for other <code>pg_config</code> directories, like <code>--bindir</code>. Once it’s
all set up, one can install a new extension and its files will be distributed
to the relevant persistent volumes.</p>
<p>This pattern makes upgrades tricky, because the core extensions are mixed in
with third-party extensions. Worse, the number of directories that must be
mounted into volumes depends on the features of an extension, increasing
deployment configuration complexity. It would be preferable to have all the
files for an extension in one place, rather than scattered across multiple
persistent volumes.</p>
<p><a href="https://postgr.es/m/0d384836-7e6e-4932-af3b-8dad1f6fee43@eisentraut.org">Peter Eisentraut’s patch</a> addresses much of this issue by adding a
search path for extension control files and related data/share files
(generally SQL files). One can create a single volume with a <code>lib</code> directory
for shared modules and <code>share/extension</code> directory for control and data/share
files.</p>
 OCI Extension Images 
<p>However, an additional wrinkle is the ambition from the <a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io" title="CloudNativePG — PostgreSQL Operator for Kubernetes">CloudNativePg</a>
(<a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io" title="CloudNativePG — PostgreSQL Operator for Kubernetes">CNPG</a>) community to eliminate the need for a persistent volume, and rely
instead on mounting images that each contain all the files for a single
extension as their own volumes, perhaps using <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/image-volumes/" title="Kubernetes Docs: Use an Image Volume With a Pod">Kubernetes image volume
feature</a>, (currently in alpha).</p>
<p>This feature requires all the file in an extension to live in a single
directory, a volume mounted to an extension image contains all the files
required to use the extension. The search path patches proposed so far do not
enable this behavior.</p>
 Postgres.app Immutability 
<p>The macOS <a href="https://postgresapp.com" title="Postgres.app: The easiest way to get started with PostgreSQL on the Mac">Postgres.app</a> supports extensions. But installing one into
<code>SHAREDIR/extensions</code> changes the contents of the Postgres.app bundle,
breaking Apple-required signature validation. The OS will no longer be able to
validate that the app is legit and refuse to start it.</p>
<p>Peter Eisentraut’s <a href="https://postgr.es/m/0d384836-7e6e-4932-af3b-8dad1f6fee43@eisentraut.org">new patch</a> addresses this issue as well, with
all the same caveats as for the <a>packager testing</a>
challenges.</p>
 Solution 
<p>To further address these issues, this RFC proposes to change file organization
and lookup patterns for PostgreSQL extensions.</p>
 Extension Directories 
<p>First, when an extension is installed, by default all of its files will live
in a single directory named for the extension. The contents include:</p>
 
 The Control file that describes extension 
 Subdirectories for SQL, shared modules, docs, binaries, etc. 
 
<p>Subdirectories roughly correspond to the <code>pg_config --*dir</code> options:</p>
 
 <code>bin</code>: Executables 
 <code>doc</code>: Documentation files 
 <code>html</code>: HTML documentation files 
 <code>lib</code>: Dynamically loadable modules 
 <code>locale</code>: Locale support files 
 <code>man</code>: Manual pages 
 <code>share</code>: SQL and other architecture-independent support files 
 
<p>This layout reduces the cognitive overhead for understanding what files belong
to what extension. Want to know what’s included in the <code>widget</code> extension?
Everything is in the <code>widget</code> directory. It also simplifies installation of an
extension: one need add only a directory named for and containing the files
required by the extension.</p>
 Configuration Parameter 
<p>Add a new <code>pg_config</code> value that returns the directory into which extensions
will by default be installed:</p>
 <code> --extdir   show location of extensions
</code> <p>Its default value would be <code>$(pg_config --sharedir)/extension</code>, but could be
set at compile time like other configuration parameters. Its contents consist
of subdirectories that each contain an extension, as described in <a>Extension
Directories</a>. With a few extensions installed, it
would look something like:</p>
  <code>❯ ls -1 "$(pg_config --extdir)"
auto_explain
bloom
isn
pair
plperl
plpgsql
plv8
xml2
semver
vector
</code>   Extension Path 
<p>Add an extension lookup path GUC akin to <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-client.html#GUC-DYNAMIC-LIBRARY-PATH"><code>dynamic_library_path</code></a>, called
<code>extension_path</code>. It lists all the directories that Postgres will search for
extensions and their files. The default value for this GUC will be:</p>
  <code>extension_path = '$extdir'
</code>  <p>The special string <code>$extdir</code> corresponds to the <code>pg_config</code> option of the same
name, and function exactly as <code>$libdir</code> does for the <code>dynamic_library_path</code>
GUC, substituting the appropriate value.</p>
 Lookup Execution 
<p>Update PostgreSQL’s <code>CREATE EXTENSION</code> command to search the directories in
<code>extension_path</code> for an extension. For each directory in the list, it will
look for the extension control file in a directory named for the extension:</p>
  <code>$dir/$extension/$extension.control
</code>  <p>The first match will be considered the canonical location for the extension.
For example, if Postgres finds the control file for the <code>pair</code> at
<code>/opt/pg17/ext/pair/pair.control</code>, it will load files only from the
appropriate subdirectories, e.g.:</p>
 
 SQL files from <code>/opt/pg17/ext/pair/share</code> 
 Shared module files from <code>/opt/pg17/ext/pair/lib</code> 
 
 PGXS 
<p>Update the extension installation behavior of <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/extend-pgxs.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: Extension Building Infrastructure">PGXS</a> to install extension
files into the new layout. A new variable, <code>$EXTDIR</code>, will define the
directory into which to install extension directories, and default to
<code>$(pg_config --extdir)</code>. It can be set to any literal path, which must exist
and be accessible by the PostgreSQL service.</p>
<p>The <code>$EXTENSION</code> variable will be changed to allow only one extension name. If
it’s set, the installation behavior will be changed for the following
variables:</p>
 
 <code>EXTENSION</code>: Creates <code>$EXTDIR/$EXTENSION</code>, installs
<code>$EXTDIR/$EXTENSION/$EXTENSION.control</code> 
 <code>MODULES</code> and <code>MODULE_big</code>: Installed into <code>$EXTDIR/$EXTENSION/lib</code> 
 <code>MODULEDIR</code>: Removed 
 <code>DATA</code> and <code>DATA_built</code>: Installed into <code>$EXTDIR/$EXTENSION/share</code> 
 <code>DATA_TSEARCH</code>: Installed into <code>$EXTDIR/$EXTENSION/share/tsearch_data</code> 
 <code>DOCS</code>: Installed into <code>$EXTDIR/$EXTENSION/doc</code> 
 <code>PROGRAM</code>, <code>SCRIPTS</code> and <code>SCRIPTS_built</code>: Installed into
<code>$EXTDIR/$EXTENSION/bin</code> 
 
<p>Each of these locations can still be overridden by setting one of the
(currently undocumented) <a href="https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/master/src/Makefile.global.in#L82-L90">installation location options</a> (e.g., <code>datadir</code>,
<code>pkglibdir</code>, etc.).</p>
  
    <blockquote>
      <p>Note</p>
      <p>External projects that install extensions without using PGXS, like <a href="https://github.com/pgcentralfoundation/pgrx" title="pgrx: Build Postgres Extensions with Rust!">pgrx</a>,
must also be updated to either follow the same pattern or to delegate
installation to <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/extend-pgxs.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: Extension Building Infrastructure">PGXS</a>.</p>
    </blockquote>
  
 Control File 
<p>The <code>directory</code> control file parameter will be deprecated and ignored.</p>
<p>The <code>module_pathname</code> parameter should only name a shared module in the <code>lib</code>
subdirectory of an extension directory. Any existing use of a <code>$libdir</code> prefix
will be stripped out and ignored before replacing the <code>MODULE_PATHNAME</code> string
in SQL files. The implication for loading extension dynamic modules<a>1</a>
differs from the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/xfunc-c.html#XFUNC-C-DYNLOAD" title="PostgreSQL Docs: Dynamic Loading">existing behavior</a> as follows:</p>
 
 If the name is an absolute path, the given file is loaded. 
 If the name does not contain a directory part, the file is searched for in
the in the <code>lib</code> subdirectory of the extension’s directory
(<code>$EXTDIR/$EXTENSION/lib</code>). 
 Otherwise (the file was not found in the path, or it contains a
non-absolute directory part), the dynamic loader will try to take the name
as given, which will most likely fail. (It is unreliable to depend on the
current working directory.) 
 
 Use Cases 
<p>Here’s how the proposed file layout and <code>extension_path</code> GUC addresses the
<a>use cases</a> that inspired this RFC.</p>
 Packager Testing 
<p>A packager who wants to run tests without modifying a PostgreSQL install would
follow these steps:</p>
 
 Prepend a directory under the packaging install to the <code>extension_path</code>
GUC. The resulting value would be something like
<code>$RPM_BUILD_ROOT/$(pg_config --extdir):$extdir</code>. 
 Install the extension into that directory:
<code>make install EXTDIR=$RPM_BUILD_ROOT</code> 
 Make sure the PostgreSQL server can access the directory, then run
<code>make installcheck</code> 
 
<p>This will allow PostgreSQL to find and load the extension during the tests.
The Postgres installation will not have been modified; only the
<code>extension_path</code> will have changed.</p>
 OCI/Kubernetes 
<p>To allow extensions to be added to a OCI container and to persist beyond its
lifetime, one or more <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/volumes/" title="Docker Docs: Volumes">volumes</a> could be used. Some examples:</p>
 
 Mount a persistent volume for extensions and prepend the path to that
directory to the <code>extension_path</code> GUC. Then Postgres can find any
extensions installed there, and they will persist. Files for all
extensions will live on a single volume. 
 Or, to meet a desire to keep some extensions separate (e.g., open-source
vs company-internal extensions), two or more persistent volumes could be
mounted, as long as they’re all included in <code>extension_path</code>, are
accessible by PostgreSQL, and users take care to install extensions in the
proper locations.

<p>To meet the <a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io" title="CloudNativePG — PostgreSQL Operator for Kubernetes">CNPG</a> ambition to “install” an extension by mounting a single
directory for each, create separate images for each extension, then use the
<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/image-volumes/" title="Kubernetes Docs: Use an Image Volume With a Pod">Kubernetes image volume feature</a> (currently in alpha) to mount each as a
read-only volume in the appropriate subdirectory of a directory included in
<code>extension_path</code>. Thereafter, any new containers would simply have to mount
all the same extension image volumes to provide the same extensions to all
containers.</p>
 Postgres.app 
<p>To allow extension installation without invalidating the Postgres.app bundle
signature, the default configuration could prepend a well-known directory
outside the app bundle, such as <code>/Library/Application Support/Postgres</code>, to
<code>extension_path</code>. Users wishing to install new extensions would then need to
point the <code>EXTDIR</code> parameter to that location, e.g.,</p>
  <code>$ make install EXTDIR="/Library/Application Support/Postgres"`
</code>  <p>Or the app could get trickier, setting the <code>--extdir</code> value to that location
so that users don’t need to use <code>EXTDIR</code>. As long as <code>extension_path</code> includes
both the bundle’s own extension directory and this external directory,
Postgres will be able to find and load all extensions.</p>
 Extension Directory Examples 
<p>A core extension like <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/citext.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: citext — a case-insensitive character string type">citext</a> would have a structure similar to:</p>
 <code>citext
├── citext.control
├── lib
│   ├── citext.dylib
│   └── bitcode
│       ├── citext
│       │   └── citext.bc
│       └── citext.index.bc
└── share
    ├── citext--1.0--1.1.sql
    ├── citext--1.1--1.2.sql
    ├── citext--1.2--1.3.sql
    ├── citext--1.3--1.4.sql
    ├── citext--1.4--1.5.sql
    ├── citext--1.4.sql
    └── citext--1.5--1.6.sql
</code> <p>The subdirectory for a pure SQL extension named “pair” in a directory named
“pair” that looks something like this:</p>
 <code>pair
├── LICENSE.md
├── README.md
├── pair.control
├── doc
│   ├── html
│   │   └── pair.html
│   └── pair.md
└── share
    ├── pair--1.0--1.1.sql
    └── pair--1.1.sql
</code> <p>A binary application like <a href="https://pgxn.org/dist/pg_top/" title="PGXN: pg_top">pg_top</a> would live in the <code>pg_top</code> directory,
structured something like:</p>
 <code>pg_top
├── HISTORY.rst
├── INSTALL.rst
├── LICENSE
├── README.rst
├── bin
│   └── pg_top
└── doc
    └── man
        └── man3
            └── pg_top.3
</code> <p>And a C extension like <a href="https://pgxn.org/dist/semver/" title="PGXN: semver">semver</a> would live in the semver directory and be
structured something like:</p>
 <code>semver
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── semver.control
├── doc
│   └── semver.md
├── lib
│   ├── semver.dylib
│   └── bitcode
│       ├── semver
│       │   └── semver.bc
│       └── semver.index.bc
└── share
    ├── semver--1.0--1.1.sql
    └── semver--1.1.sql
</code>  Phase Two: Preloading 
<p>The above-proposed <a>solution</a> does not allow shared modules
distributed with extensions to compatibly be loaded via <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-client.html#RUNTIME-CONFIG-CLIENT-PRELOAD" title="PostgreSQL Docs: Shared Library Preloading">shared library
preloading</a>, because extension modules wil no longer live in the
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-client.html#GUC-DYNAMIC-LIBRARY-PATH"><code>dynamic_library_path</code></a>. Users can specify full paths, however. For example,
instead of:</p>
  <code>shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_partman_bgw'
</code>  <p>One could use the path to the <code>lib</code> subdirectory of the extension’s directory:</p>
  <code>shared_preload_libraries = '/opt/postgres/extensions/pg_partman_bgw/lib/pg_partman_bgw'
</code>  <p>But users will likely find this pattern cumbersome, especially for extensions
with multiple shared modules. Perhaps some special syntax could be added to
specify a single extension module, such as:</p>
  <code>shared_preload_libraries = '$extension_path::pg_partman_bgw'
</code>  <p>But this overloads the semantics of <code>shared_preload_libraries</code> and the code
that processes it rather heavily, not to mention the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/sql-load.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: LOAD"><code>LOAD</code></a> command.</p>
<p>Therefore, as a follow up to the <a>solution</a> proposed above, this
RFC proposes additional changes to PostgreSQL.</p>
 Extension Preloading 
<p>Add new GUCs that complement <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-client.html#RUNTIME-CONFIG-CLIENT-PRELOAD" title="PostgreSQL Docs: Shared Library Preloading">shared library preloading</a>, but for extension
module preloading:</p>
 
 <code>shared_preload_extensions</code> 
 <code>session_preload_extensions</code> 
 <code>local_preload_extensions</code> 
 
<p>Each takes a list of extensions for which to preload shared modules. In
addition, another new GUC, <code>local_extensions</code>, will contain a list of
administrator-approved extensions users are allowed to include in
<code>local_preload_extensions</code>. This GUC complements <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-client.html#GUC-LOCAL-PRELOAD-LIBRARIES" title="PostgreSQL Docs: local_preload_libraries"><code>local_preload_libraries</code></a>’s
use of a <code>plugins</code> directory.</p>
<p>Then modify the preloading code to also preload these files. For each
extension in a list, it would:</p>
 
 Search each path in <code>extension_path</code> for the extension. 
 When found, load all the shared libraries from <code>$extension/lib</code>. 
 
<p>For example, to load all shared modules in the <code>pg_partman</code> extension, set:</p>
  <code>shared_preload_extensions = 'pg_partman'
</code>  <p>To load a single shared module from an extension, give its name after the
extension name and two colons. This example will load only the
<code>pg_partman_bgw</code> shared module from the <code>pg_partman</code> extension:</p>
  <code>shared_preload_extensions = 'pg_partman::pg_partman_bgw'
</code>  <p>This change requires a one-time change to existing preload configurations on
upgrade.</p>
 Future: Deprecate LOAD 
<p>For a future change, consider modifying <code>CREATE EXTENSION</code> to support shared
module-only extensions. This would allow extensions with no SQL component,
such as <code>auto_explain</code>, to be handled like any other extension; it would live
under one of the directories in <code>extension_path</code> with a structure like this:</p>
 <code>auto_explain
├── auto_explain.control
└── lib
   ├── auto_explain.dylib
   └── bitcode
       ├── auto_explain
       │   └── auto_explain.bc
       └── auto_explain.index.bc
</code> <p>Note the <code>auto_explain.control</code> file. It would need a new parameter to
indicate that the extension includes no SQL files, so <code>CREATE EXTENSION</code> and
related commands wouldn’t try to find them.</p>
<p>With these changes, extensions could become the primary, recommended interface
for extending PostgreSQL. Perhaps the <code>LOAD</code> command could be deprecated, and
the <code>*_preload_libraries</code> GUCs along with it.</p>
 Compatibility Issues 
 
 The <code>module_pathname</code> control file variable would prefer the name of a
shared module. The code that replaces the <code>MODULE_PATHNAME</code> string in SQL
files would to strip out the <code>$libdir/</code> prefix, if present. 
 The behavior of loading dynamic modules that ship with extensions (i.e.,
the value of the <code>AS</code> part of <code>CREATE FUNCTION</code>) would change to look for
a library name (with no directory part) in the <code>lib</code> subdirectory of the
extension directory. 
 The <code>directory</code> control file parameter and the <code>MODULEDIR</code> PGXS variable
would be deprecated and ignored. 
 <code>*_preload_libraries</code> would no longer be used to find extension modules
without full paths. Administrators would have to remove module names from
these GUCs and add the relevant extension names to the new
<code>*_preload_extensions</code> variables. To ease upgrades, we might consider
adding a PGXS variable that, when true, would symlink shared modules into
<code>--pkglibdr</code>. 
 <code>LOAD</code> would no longer be able to find shared modules included with
extensions, unless we add a PGXS variable that, when true, would symlink
shared modules into <code>--pkglibdr</code>. 
 The <code>EXTENSION</code> PGXS variable will no longer support multiple extension
names. 
 The change in extension installation locations must also be adopted by
projects that don’t use PGXS for installation, like <a href="https://github.com/pgcentralfoundation/pgrx" title="pgrx: Build Postgres Extensions with Rust!">pgrx</a>. Or perhaps
they could be modified to also use PGXS. Long term it might be useful to
replace the <code>Makefile</code>-based PGXS with another installation system,
perhaps a CLI. 
 
 Out of Scope 
<p>This RFC does not include or attempt to address the following issue:</p>
 
 How to manage third-party shared libraries. Making system dependencies
consistent in a OCI/Kubernetes environment or for non-system binary
packaging patterns presents its own challenges, though they’re not
specific to PostgreSQL or the patterns described here. Research is ongoing
into potential solutions, and will be addressed elsewhere.

<p>The first time I heard a critique of mediated experience, the critic was my dad. He was an avid photographer who, during our family’s year in India, when I was a young child, used his 35mm Exacta to capture thousands of photos that became carousels of color slides we viewed for many years thereafter. It was a remarkable documentary effort that solidified our memories of that year. But dad was aware of the tradeoff. A favorite joke became: “Q: How was your trip?” “A: I won’t know until the film is developed!” He realized that interposing a camera between himself and the people he encountered had altered the direct experience he and they would otherwise have had.</p>
<p>This weekend I heard <a href="https://www.samharris.org/podcasts/making-sense-episodes/392-technology-culture">Christine Rosen’s</a> modern version of that critique in a discussion of her new book <a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/1454717522">The extinction of experience: Being human in a disembodied world</a>. I listened to the podcast on a hike, my noise-canceling Airpods insulating me from the sounds of the creek trail and from the people walking along it.</p>
<p>It’s complicated. When hiking alone I greatly value the ability to listen to interesting people and ideas while exercising, breathing fresh air, and moving through the natural world. The experience is embodied in one sense, disembodied in another. Reading the same material while lying on the couch would be a different, and arguably more extreme, form of disembodiment. But when I passed a family of four, all walking along looking at their phones, that felt wrong. When people are together they should actually be together, right? You’ve doubtless felt the same when seeing people in this together-but-not-together state.</p>
<p>Lately Pete Buttigieg has been urging us to spend less time online, more time IRL having face-to-face conversations. I think that’s right. There’s no doubt that the decline of social capital described in Robert Putnam’s <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_Alone">Bowling Alone</a> has accelerated in the 30 years since he wrote that book. America’s tragic polarization is a predictable outcome. Without the institutions and cultural traditions that once brought us together, face-to-face, in non-political ways, we’re all too vulnerable to being herded into competing online echo chambers that magnify our differences and erase our common humanity. </p>
<p>I won’t be abandoning my mediated and disembodied life online, but I do need to participate in it less and more critically, and prioritize my unmediated and embodied life IRL. The pendulum has swung too far away from the direct experience of shared reality, and that hasn’t been good for me nor for my country, </p>

<p>This article shows how to implement a secure web application using <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/introduction-to-aspnet-core">ASP.NET Core</a>. The web application implements the backend for frontend security architecture (BFF) and deploys both technical stacks as one web application. HTTP only secure cookies are used to persist the session. <a href="https://documentation.openiddict.com/">OpenIddict </a>is used as the identity provider and the token issuer.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/bff-aspnetcore-oidc-vuejs">https://github.com/damienbod/bff-aspnetcore-oidc-vuejs</a></p>



 Overview 



<p>The solution is deployed as a single OpenID Connect confidential client using a separate OpenIddict identity provider. The OpenID Connect client authenticates using the code flow with PKCE and a secret or a certificate. The UI part of the solution is deployed as part of the server application. Secure HTTP only cookies are used to persist the session after a successful authentication. No security flows are implemented in the client part of the application. No sensitive data like tokens are exposed in the client browser. By removing the security from the client, the security is improved and the complexity is reduced.</p>







<p></p>



 Setup Vue.js application 



<p>The Vue.js UI is setup so that the default development environment is used like in any Vue.js standalone application. A reverse proxy is used to integrate the application into the secure backend development environment. The UI uses Vue.js 3 with Typescript and Vite. </p>



 HTTPS setup and Production build 



<p>The production build is used to add the application as a UI view in the server rendered application, in this case ASP.NET Core. I always use HTTPS in development, so that the errors are discovered early and a strong CSP can also be used. This is all setup in the <a href="https://vitejs.dev/">vite</a> project file.</p>


  import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'
import fs from 'fs';

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [vue()],
  server: {
    https: {
		key: fs.readFileSync('./certs/dev_localhost.key'),
		cert: fs.readFileSync('./certs/dev_localhost.pem'),
	},
    port: 4202,
    strictPort: true, // exit if port is in use
    hmr: {
      clientPort: 4202, 
    },
  },
  optimizeDeps: {
    force: true,
  },
  build: {
    outDir: "../server/wwwroot",
    emptyOutDir: true
  },
})
  


<p></p>



 CSP setup 



<p>The CSP is setup to use nonces both in development and production. This will save time fixing CSP issues before you go live. Vue.js creates scripts and styles on a build or a npm dev (vite). The scripts require the nonce. The styles require a nonce in production. To add the server created nonce, the index.html file uses a meta tag in the header as well as the server rendered middleware parsing for scripts and styles. The nonce gets added and updated with a new value on every HTTP response. This can be used directly in the Vue.js code. When adding further script statically or dynamically, the nonce placeholder can be used. This gets updated dynamically in development and production environments.</p>


  &lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="UTF-8" /&gt;
	&lt;meta name="CSP_NONCE" content="**PLACEHOLDER_NONCE_SERVER**" /&gt;
    &lt;link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/vite.svg" /&gt;
    &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" /&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Vite + Vue + TS&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div id="app"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    /src/main.ts
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
  


<p>The ASP.NET Core _host file is used to serve up the index.html and adds in the dynamic bits to the Vue.js application. The scripts and styles have a nonce applied in production and the scripts in the development environment. Added and replace the CSP nonce can be done in different ways and needs to match the Vue.js index.html. This can change, depending on the setup of the Vue.js index.html.</p>

 Anti-forgery protection 



<p>Cookies are used to store the session authentication. The authentication cookie is a HTTP only secure cookie only for its domain. Browser Same Site protection helps secure the session. Old browsers do not support Same Site and Anti-forgery protection is still required. You can add this protection in two ways. I use a CSRF anti-forgery cookie. You could also use custom headers with validation. The getCookie script gets the anti-forgery cookie which was created by the server. This cookie is not HTTP only because it needs to be read into the UI. </p>


  export const getCookie = (cookieName: string) =&gt; {
  const name = `${cookieName}=`;
  const decodedCookie = decodeURIComponent(document.cookie);
  const ca = decodedCookie.split(";");
  for (let i = 0; i &lt; ca.length; i += 1) {
    let c = ca[i];
    while (c.charAt(0) === " ") {
      c = c.substring(1);
    }
    if (c.indexOf(name) === 0) {
      return c.substring(name.length, c.length);
    }
  }
  return "";
};
  


<p>The Anti-forgery header is added to every API call which requires this. I use axios to request API data, and the header needs to be added to the axiosConfig. For the demo, I just implemented this directly the Vue js component. The component makes various API calls.</p>


  &lt;script setup lang="ts"&gt;

  }

	axios.get(`${getCurrentHost()}/api/DirectApi`, axiosConfig)

		}

		return response.data;
	})

	});
}

function getCurrentHost() {
	const host = window.location.host;
	const url = `${window.location.protocol}//${host}`;

 Setup ASP.NET Core application 



<p>The ASP.NET Core project is setup to host the static html file from Vue.js and respond to all HTTP requests as defined using the APIs. The nonce is added to the index.html file. The standard ASP.NET Core OpenID Connect handler is used to authenticate the user and the application. The session is stored in a cookie. The <a href="https://github.com/andrewlock/NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders">NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders</a> Nuget package is used to add the security headers and the CSP.</p>

 Development environment 



<p>Developers require a professional development setup and should use the technical stacks like the creators of the technical stacks recommend. Default development environments is the aim and always the easiest to maintain. The Vue.js project uses a default vite environment or best practices as the Vue.js community recommends. The server part of the application must proxy all UI requests to the Vue.js development environment. I use Microsoft YARP reverse proxy to implement this. This is only required for development in this setup. Some flavors of the BFF use proxies in the production environments as well.</p>







<p></p>



 Testing and running 



<p>The appsettings.json MUST be updated with your OpenIddict server configuration values. If using a client secret, store this in the user secrets for development, or in a key vault when deployed to Azure.</p>


  "OpenIDConnectSettings": {
    "Authority": "https://localhost:44318",
    "ClientId": "oidc-pkce-confidential",
    "ClientSecret": "oidc-pkce-confidential_secret"
},
  


 Debugging 



<p>Start the Vue.js project from the&nbsp;ui&nbsp;folder</p>


  npm start
  


<p>Start the ASP.NET Core project from the&nbsp;server&nbsp;folder</p>


  dotnet run
  


<p>When the localhost of the server app is opened, you can authenticate and use.</p>



 Notes 



<p>I was not able to apply the nonce to the dev environment styles of the Vue.js part. This would be of great benefit as you can prevent insecure styles in development and not discover these problems after a deployment. In the production build, the nonce is applied correctly.</p>

<p>I quit Twitter in November 2022, when it became clear that Phony Stark would
take control of the company. No regrets; I’ve been active <a href="https://xoxo.zone/@theory" title="@theory@xoxo.zone">on Mastodon</a> since
then, via <a href="https://tapbots.com/ivory/">Ivory</a>, where I’ve enjoyed the Twitter ca. 2010 vibe.</p>
<p>But I hadn’t deleted my Tweets or my accounts until this week. The change was
finally triggered by the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/x-sees-largest-user-exodus-musk-takeover-rcna179793" title="X sees largest user exodus since Musk takeover">latest announcement</a>:</p>
  
    <blockquote>
      <p>On Friday, X will adopt a new terms of service policy that for the first
time explicitly says all users agree to let their posts be used to train
artificial intelligence, like the company’s generative AI service, Grok.
Currently, X users can go to the site’s settings and opt out.</p>
    </blockquote>
  
<p>I have no interest in feeding Grok or any other large language model. So this
week I deleted all my tweets and then my accounts. I tried to transfer my
personal username to a new, empty account, but in the second between changing
it and switching to another tab to take it, it was somehow acquired by an
account created in 2011 with no posts. Not sure how that worked. Pretty scummy.</p>
<p>So, just to be clear, anyone using these usernames on Twitter are not me
anymore:</p>
 
 @theory 
 @lunar_theory 
 @DesignScene 
 @pgxn 
 
<p>See you <a href="https://xoxo.zone/@theory" title="@theory@xoxo.zone">on Mastodon</a> — or perhaps <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/theory.fyi" title="theory.fyi">Bluesky</a>.</p>

<p>Heute vor einem Jahr <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/durchbruch-im-europaeischen-parlament-piraten-feiern-klare-absage-an-chatkontrolle-und-garantie-sicherer-verschluesselung/">haben wir im Ausschuss für bürgerliche Freiheiten, Justiz und Inneres (LIBE) des EU-Parlaments eine fraktionsübergreifende Position gegen anlasslose Chatkontrolle beschlossen</a>. Damit haben wir den wahnwitzigen Überwachungsplänen eine Absage erteilt, welche die von der Leyen-EU-Kommission vorgelegt hat.</p>



<p>Neben dem Europäischen Parlament müssen die EU-Regierungen im Rat eine Position zu dem Gesetzentwurf beschließen. Schon drei Mal wurde die notwendige Mehrheit dort verfehlt. Sowohl die spanische Ratspräsidentschaft im Oktober 2023 als auch der belgische Vorsitz im Juni 2024 haben die Abstimmung über die Chatkontrolle kurzfristig von der Tagesordnung des Rats der EU genommen, als sich ein Scheitern bei der Abstimmung abgezeichnet hat – ein Riesenerfolg der Zivilgesellschaft.</p>



<p>Die Europäische Kommission wird gerade neu gebildet. Bisher tat EU-Innenkommissarin Ylva Johansson (S&amp;D, Schweden) als Mutter der Chatkontrolle alles, um ihr Vorhaben durchzuprügeln. Nun soll Magnus Brunner (EVP, Österreich) auf sie im Amt folgen und das Projekt weiterführen. Er hat in seinem Anhörungsverfahren gegenüber dem Europäischen Parlament auf die Frage der Piratin <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/de/197549/MARKETA_GREGOROVA/home">Markéta Gregorová</a> schon signalisiert, <a href="https://hearings.elections.europa.eu/documents/brunner/brunner_writtenquestionsandanswers_en.pdf">dass er die Verhandlungen zur Chatkontrolle zum Abschluss bringen will</a>. Ein Bekenntnis zum Schutz vor flächendeckender Chatkontrolle oder Schutz sicherer Verschlüsselung kam ihm nicht über die Lippen. Das ist ein Fehler: die EU-Kommission muss sich endgültig von Massenüberwachung verabschieden. Die anlasslose Chatkontrolle muss vom Tisch!</p>



<p>Im Europaparlament habe ich mich als euer Abgeordneter der Piratenpartei Deutschland federführend in den Verhandlungen eingesetzt, um die Chatkontrolle zu verhindern und auch die Abgeordneten der anderen Fraktionen in unzähligen Beratungen davon überzeugt. Heute trägt Markéta Gregorová für die europäischen Piraten die Fackel der Digitalen Freiheitskämpfer*innen im Europäischen Parlament weiter und setzt sich dort gegen die Chatkontrolle ein.</p>



<p>Im Rat der EU konnten wir bisher nur dank des unermüdlichen Engagements und des lautstarken Protests der Zivilgesellschaft totalitäre flächendeckende Chatkontrollen verhindern. Möglich war das dank jeder Aktivistin und jedem Einzelnen, die sich telefonisch, per E-Mail oder per Brief immer wieder an Politik und Regierung gewendet haben. Danke für euren Einsatz! Wir müssen stark bleiben und auch bei jedem weiteren Anlauf gegen die extreme und weltweit einzigartige Bedrohung des digitalen Briefgeheimnisses und sicherer Verschlüsselung durch die Chatkontrolle kämpfen!</p>

<p>Reference: <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/</a></p>



<blockquote>
<p>Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) are a new type of identifier that enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity. A DID refers to any subject (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.) as determined by the controller of the DID. In contrast to typical, federated identifiers, DIDs have been designed so that they may be decoupled from centralized registries, identity providers, and certificate authorities.</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<p>DID subject<br>The entity identified by a DID and described by a DID document. Anything can be a DID subject: person, group, organization, physical thing, digital thing, logical thing, etc.</p>

 Web 7.0/TDW DID Method Clusters Model Taxonomy 0.1 



<a href="https://hyperonomy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/1000006486.png"></a>



 
 A bold&nbsp;method&nbsp;is the model method or exemplar for the particular cluster (cell). 



 A method can be a exemplar for 1 or many clusters. 



 This list of DID method categories is just an example. A complete taxonomy will likely be a 2-3 level hierarchy. The parent categories for these examples might include: Live Things, Inanimate Things, Abstract Things, Digital Things, Business Things, etc. etc. 



 More than one exemplar per cluster is permitted. 
 



 12. Process Framework: Sociocracy 



<p>Reference: <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-methods/issues/4">https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-methods/issues/4</a></p>



<blockquote>
<p>In Sociocracy terminology, a mini-WG is called a&nbsp;circle. Each category of DID methods (cluster of DID Methods) would be managed by its own independent circle. A circle member can belong to more than 1 circle. Circles are&nbsp;connected&nbsp;to a parent circle for administrative purposes. The parent circle would correspond to the DID Method WG (co-chaired by Markus).</p>

<p>Sociocracy combines consent decision-making, a decentralized system of authority and intentional processes to improve our decisions and processes over time into a governance system that supports effective and efficient process while increasing connection, listening and co-creation among members.</p>

  <p>Today, a post in my feed included a mention and its webfinger verification threw a WebFinger::BadRequest exception:</p>

<p>The activitypub actor document resided on mastodon.well.com but when a <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/reports/socialcg/CG-FINAL-apwf-20240608/#reverse-discovery">reverse discovery</a> was performed, the hostname of the subject in the webfinger response was well.com instead of mastodon.well.com.  Making a webfinger request to well.com for the mentioned user returned a 500 Internal Server Error so a WebFinger::BadRequest exception was thrown.  What was going on?</p>

<p>Fortunately, <a href="https://github.com/swicg/activitypub-webfinger/issues/28">an issue in the activitypub-webfinger</a> had the answer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Looks like some are using this host-meta redirect to use a custom domain for actors which is different to the actual domain of the server.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And that is what was happening:</p>

  <code>curl https://mastodon.well.com/.well-known/host-meta
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;XRD xmlns="http://docs.oasis-open.org/ns/xri/xrd-1.0"&gt;
  &lt;Link rel="lrdd" template="https://mastodon.well.com/.well-known/webfinger?resource={uri}"/&gt;
&lt;/XRD&gt;
</code> 
 

<p>A response in the issue notes</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The use of host-meta as a “second layer of indirection” is something that mostly a holdover from the OStatus days, IIRC. Most projects that aren’t Mastodon or Pleroma will not check host-meta at all, and will instead always skip straight to the /.well-known/webfinger endpoint. I don’t think it makes sense to unnecessarily pressure everyone into adopting host-meta or supporting variable LRDD endpoints</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can’t argue with that so I just <a href="https://github.com/herestomwiththeweather/irwin/commit/10a8d622e022bc48521afd11e63fb3962fce71f4">handled the exception without setting the custom domain</a>.</p>

We have 364 attendees from around the world who called 178 sessions. I can't begin to describe the energy of the identity community when they all get together to discuss their favorite topics. If you like identity, or simply want to be part of an enthusiastic technical community, you should come to IIW.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F058990e6-03e6-4368-b36b-cce209a3bbc7_4025x1827.heic">          </a> <p>As you can see by the pins in the map at the top of this post, there were attendees from all over the world. Not surprisingly, most of the attendees were from the US (251), followed by Canada (18) and France (14). Germany, Japan, and Australia rounded out the top six with 12, 9, and 7 attendees respectively. Attendees from India (5), Columbia (3), and Chile (2) show IIW's geographic diversity. Sadly, there were no attendees from Africa again. Please remember we offer scholarships for people from underrepresented areas, so if you'd like to come to IIW40, please let us know.

<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/theory/jsonpath">github.com/theory/jsonpath</a>. Why? For a personal project, I needed a simpler

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"

	"github.com/theory/jsonpath"
)

func main() {
	// Parse a jsonpath query.
	p, err := jsonpath.Parse(`$["name", "slogan"]`)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	// Select values from unmarshaled JSON input.
	json := map[string]any{
		"name":   "Kamala Harris",
		"title":  "Vice President of the United States",
		"home":   "California",
		"slogan": "We are not going back!",
	}
	items := p.Select(json)

	// Show the result.
	fmt.Printf("%#v\n", items)
}
</code>  <p>And the output:</p>
  <code>[]interface {}{"Kamala Harris", "We are not going back!"}
</code>   🛝 Playground 
<p>No need to write code to try it out, though. I’ve also written a <a href="https://theory.github.io/jsonpath/" title="Go JSONPath Playground">playground
webapp</a> to encourage experimentation and exploration of the syntax and
behavior of the package. The implementation follows the precedents set by the
<a href="https://theory.github.io/sqljson/">Go SQL/JSON Playground</a> and design of the <a href="https://serdejsonpath.lives">Rust JSONPath Playground</a>.
Moreover, thanks to <a href="https://tinygo.org/" title="TinyGo - A Go Compiler For Small Places">TinyGo</a>, the <a href="https://webassembly.org/" title="WebAssembly">Wasm</a> file comes in at a mere 254K!</p>
<p>The webapp loads sample JSON from the <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9535.html" title="RFC 9535 JSONPath: Query Expressions for JSON">RFC</a>, and randomly rotates through a
few example JSONPath queries. Fill in your own and tap the “Permalink” button
to share links. The Playground is a stateless JavaScript/Wasm web
application: data persists only in permalink URLs.<a>1</a></p>

 Status 
<p>The root <code>jsonpath</code> package is stable and ready for use. Other packages remain
in flux, as I refactor and rejigger things in the coming weeks as part of the
aforementioned personal project. But for actual JSONPath execution and
querying, it should continue to work as-is for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>I hope you find it useful.</p>

<p>This is a big deal. My <a href="https://justatheory.com/2023/12/times-up/" title="Times Up">former colleagues</a> in the <a href="https://nytimesguild.org">New York Times Tech Guild</a>
have declared a strike today in response to a number of unfair labor practice
violations and management’s inability to bargain in good faith. From the
<a href="https://wapo.st/3UBVSbs" title="New York Times Tech Guild goes on strike">Washington Post</a>:</p>
  
    <blockquote>
      <p>Represented by the NewsGuild of New York, the Tech Guild has been
negotiating its first contract with the company since 2022. Both sides have
accused the other side of bogging down contract talks, which have recently
focused on <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/media/2024/10/23/new-york-times-tech-guild-strike/" title="What happens if the NYT’s tech staff strikes on election night?">three key issues</a>: “just cause” job protections (which ensure
employees can’t be fired without reason and due process), remote work and
pay equity. Unit members voted overwhelmingly in September to authorize the
strike, saying the timing of the authorization — in the run-up to the
high-profile election period — was “no accident.”</p>
    </blockquote>
  
<p>I urge you to join me in supporting the <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/nyt-tech-strike-fund" title="gofundme: Support NYT Tech workers!">strike fund</a>, which will help more
vulnerable members to weather the strike.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the Guild asks supporters to refrain from interacting with
Cooking and Games, and to break your streaks. Times reporters Maggie Astor has
<a href="https://www.threads.net/@astor.maggie/post/DB81_ppxGPP">the details</a>:</p>
  
    <blockquote>
      <p>As of this morning, the New York Times Tech Guild, which represents NYT tech
workers, is on strike.</p>
<p>Unless it’s resolved while today’s Wordle is still live, this streak is
gone.</p>
<p>NYT Games and Cooking are BEHIND THE PICKET LINE. Please don’t play or
engage with Games or Cooking content while the strike lasts!</p>
<p>News coverage is NOT behind the picket line. It’s okay to read and share
that, though the site and app may have problems.</p>
    </blockquote>
  
<p>Read the <a href="https://www.threads.net/@astor.maggie/post/DB81_ppxGPP">whole thread</a> for more information, which, as she says, “the
rules may not be what you think!”</p>

 When you want to do a hackathon but am missing the perfect&nbsp;idea. Compliments of Flux.1&nbsp;Schnell<p>You likely know the saying, “Don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good/done.” Sometimes, I have a hard time living that, and an existing effort is one example. I have registered for an AI agent hackathon, <a href="https://www.tensorops.ai/aiagentsonlinehackathon">Agents Craft Hackathon</a>. I don’t plan to be competitive but I doubt that is the goal of most participants. I do want a good idea that makes a great example and is a pseudo-novel idea that implements an agent usage not in the <a href="https://github.com/NirDiamant/GenAI_Agents">GenAI_Agents Github repo</a>. Therein lies my problem; a unique and interesting use case and example. I’m inspiration-blocked. I know that I am letting the perfect be the enemy of the good or even of the enemy of the fun because there is a Discord channel with participant-created ideas for teams to work on. I want it simple yet inspired. I’m not inspired by any of the existing team projects; nothing against the projects as this is a me problem. I have a few more days to think about&nbsp;it.</p><p>Maybe you should join the hackathon. Your idea might be inspiring.</p>

<p>Last week I MCed the first Extension Ecosystem Summit EU and attended my first
at PGConf EU in Athens, Greece. Despite my <a href="https://justatheory.com/2007/03/five-things/#2-i-used-to-be-an-archaeologist" title="Five Things You Don't Know About Me">former career as an archaeologist</a>
— with a focus on Mediterranean cultures, no less! — this was my first
visit to Greece. My favorite moment was the evening after the Summit, when I
cut out of a networking shindig to walk to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaka" title="Wikipedia: Plaka">Pláka</a> and then circumnavigate the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acropolis_of_Athens" title="Wikipedia: Acropolis of Athens">Acropolis</a>. I mean just look at this place!</p>

<p>Highlight of the trip for sure. But the Summit and conference were terrific,
as well.</p>
 Extension Ecosystem Summit 
<p><a href="https://dev.to/@floord">Floor Drees</a> kindly organized The Extension Ecosystem Summit EU, the
follow-up to the <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/02/extension-ecosystem-summit/" title="Extension Ecosystem Summit 2024">PGConf.dev original</a>. While the Vancouver Summit focused on
developers, we tailored this iteration to users. I started the gathering with
a condensed version of my <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/06/posette/#i-also-spoke" title="POSETTE 2024">POSETTE talk</a>, “State of the Postgres Extension
Ecosystem”, but updated with a <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/06/trunk-oci-poc/#demo" title="POC: Distributing Trunk Binaries via OCI — Demo">Trunk OCI Distribution</a> demo. Links:</p>

 <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/10/pgconf-extension-summit-eu/state-of-the-ecosystem-eu.key">Keynote</a> 
 
<p>We then moved into a lightning round of 10 minute introductions to a variety
of extensions:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vyruss/">Jimmy Angelakos</a> showed off <a href="https://pgxn.org/dist/pg_statviz/" title="PGXN: pg_statviz">pg_statviz</a>, a “minimalist extension and
utility pair for time series analysis and visualization of PostgreSQL
internal statistics”. 
 <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-hendel/">Adam Hendel</a> gave a brief history of <a href="https://pgxn.org/dist/pgmq/" title="PGXN: pgmq">pgmq</a>, is a “lightweight message
queue like AWS SQS and RSMQ, but on Postgres.” 
 <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gulcinyildirim/">Gülçin Yıldırım Jelínek</a> introduced <a href="https://github.com/xataio/pgzx" title="GitHub: xataio/pgzx">pgzx</a>, “a library for developing
PostgreSQL extensions written in <a href="https://ziglang.org/" title="Zig Programming Language">Zig</a>.” 
 <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-blackwood-sewell/">James Sewell</a> talked about <a href="https://github.com/timescale/pgvectorscale" title="GitHub: timescale/pgvectorscale">pgvectorscale</a> and <a href="https://github.com/timescale/pgai" title="GitHub: timescale/pgai">pgai</a> for managing
machine training workloads on Postgres. 
 <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/decodableminion/">Alastair Turner</a> described <a href="https://github.com/percona/pg_tde" title="GitHub: percona/pg_tde">pg_tde</a>, an extension that provides
transparent data encryption for Postgres. 
 
<p>Quite the whirlwind! There followed open discussion, in which each maintainer
went to a corner to talk to attendees about contributing to their extensions.
Details to come in a more thorough writeup on the <a href="https://tembo.io/blog/" title="Tembo’s Blog">Tembo blog</a>, but I personally
enjoyed some fascinating discussions about extension distribution challenges.</p>
 PGConf.eu 
<p>Following the Summit, I attended several thought-provoking and provocative
presentations at <a href="https://2024.pgconf.eu" title="PostgreSQL Conference Europe 2024">PGConf.eu</a>, which took place at the same hotel, conveniently
enough.</p>

 In the conference keynote, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stacey-haysler-ssh/">Stacey Haysler</a> explained the <a href="https://www.postgresql.eu/events/pgconfeu2024/schedule/session/5869/">The PostgreSQL
License Fee</a>. I’m pleased to say that my employer “pays” license fee! 
 <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andres-freund/">Andres Freund</a> (yes, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/04/11/1244174104" title="NPR: One engineer may have saved the world from a massive cyber attack">that one</a>) summarized <a href="https://www.postgresql.eu/events/pgconfeu2024/schedule/session/5839/">NUMA vs PostgreSQL</a>,
covering some of the issues and opportunities for optimization of
PostgreSQL on servers using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-uniform_memory_access" title="Wikipedia: Non-uniform memory access">NUMA</a> multi-processor memory
architecture. 
 <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/heikki-linnakangas-6b58bb203/">Heikki Linnakangas</a> offered an overview of <a href="https://www.postgresql.eu/events/pgconfeu2024/schedule/session/5897/">The Wire Protocol</a>, that bit
of PostgreSQL technology that lets clients talk to PostgreSQL. 
 <a href="https://ophir.dev">Ophir Lojkine</a> and Thomas Guillemard <a href="https://www.postgresql.eu/events/pgconfeu2024/schedule/session/5707/" title="Unearthing the Past with PostgreSQL: How Open Source is Revolutionizing Digital Archaeology">showed</a> how a pretty sweet
framework, <a href="https://sql.datapage.app/">SQLPage</a>, lets archaeologists like Thomas write complete web
applications in pure SQL, enabling rapid data entry while in the field. 
 <a href="https://github.com/tvondra">Tomas Vondra</a>’s <a href="https://www.postgresql.eu/events/pgconfeu2024/schedule/session/5585/">Performance Archaeology</a> dug into the history of
PostgreSQL improvements, mapping their compounding returns over time. 
 <a href="https://dev.to/@floord">Floor Drees</a> (photo above) talked about <a href="https://www.postgresql.eu/events/pgconfeu2024/schedule/session/5946/">Supporting extensions, but
really now</a>, making a strong case for the need to organize infrastructure
to support the broader extension ecosystem. 
 
<p>There were many more talks, but clearly I tend to be drawn to the most
technical, core-oriented topics. And also archaeology.</p>
 Museums 
<p>Speaking of which, I made time to visit two museums while in Athens. First up
was the <a href="https://www.namuseum.gr/en/">National Archaeological Museum of Athens</a>, where I was delighted to
explore the biggest collection of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycenaean_Greece" title="Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycenaean Greece">Mycenaean</a> artifacts I’ve ever seen,
including massive collections from the excavations of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Schliemann" title="Wikipedia: Heinrich Schliemann">Heinrich Schliemann</a>.
So much great <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age" title="Wikipedia: Bronze Age">Bronze Age</a> stuff here. I mean, just look at this absolute unit:</p>


	
			
		
			<p>From the museum description: “Fragment of a krater depicting a chariot with
two occupants. A male figure holding a staff walks in front of the chariot.
Much of the Mycenaean Pictorial Style pottery (14th-12th centuries BC) with
representations of humans, chariots, horses and bulls on large kraters, was
produced at Berbati in the Argolid and exported to Cyprus, where it was widely
imitated. Birds, fish, wild goats or imaginary creatures (i.e. sphinxes) occur
on other types of vessels, such as jugs and stirrup jars. Usually only
fragments of these vases survive in mainland Greece from settlement contexts.
In Cyprus, however, complete vases are preserved, placed as grave gifts in
tombs.”

<p>The animal decorations on Mycenaean and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akrotiri_(prehistoric_city)" title="Wikipedia: Akrotiri (prehistoric city)">Akrotiri</a> pottery is simply
delightful. I also enjoyed the Hellenistic stuff, and seeing the famed
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism" title="Wikipedia: Antikythera mechanism">Antikythera Mechanism</a> filled my nerd heart with joy. A good 3 hours poking
around; I’ll have to go back and spend a few days there sometime. Thanks to my
pal <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/evan-hunter-stanton/">Evan Stanton</a> for gamely wandering around this fantastic museum with me.</p>
<p>Immediately after the PGConf.eu closing session, I dashed off to the
<a href="https://theacropolismuseum.gr/en/">Acropolis Museum</a>, which stays open till 10 on Fridays. Built in 2009, this
modern concrete-and-glass building exhibits several millennia of artifacts and
sculpture exclusively excavated from the Acropolis or preserved from its
building façades. No photography allowed, alas, but I snapped this photo
looking out on the Acropolis from the top floor.</p>

from the Parthenon inside the museum reflect in the glass, as does, yes, your
humble photographer.

<p>I was struck by the beauty and effectiveness of the displays. It easily puts
the lie to the assertion that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elgin_Marbles" title="Wikipedia: Elgin Marbles">Elgin Marbles</a> must remain in the British
Museum to protect them. I saw quite a few references to the stolen sculptures,
particularly empty spots and artfully sloppy casts from the originals, but the
building itself makes the strongest case that the marbles should be returned.</p>
<p>But even without them there remains a ton of beautiful sculpture to see.
Highly recommended!</p>
 Back to Work 
<p>Now that my sojourn in Athens has ended, I’m afraid I must return to work. I
mean, the event was work, too; I talked to a slew of people about a number of
projects in flight. More on those soon.</p>

<p>In my <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/06/pgconf-future-ecosystem/" title="PGConf.dev 2024">PGConf.dev report</a> a couple days ago, I mentioned that a few actionable
items came out of the <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PGConf.dev_2024_Developer_Unconference#Improving_extensions_in_core">Improving extensions in core</a> unconference session. One
was the need to document the heretofore unofficial policy for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API" title="Wikipedia: API">API</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface" title="Wikipedia: Application binary interface">ABI</a>
stability between major and, especially, minor versions of Postgres.</p>
<p>A frequent topic at the <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/02/extension-ecosystem-summit/" title="Extension Ecosystem Summit 2024">Extension Summit and Mini-Summits</a> and a number of
PCConf sessions has been concern regarding compatibility changes between minor
releases of Postgres. At <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/05/mini-summit-five/">Mini Summit Five</a>, for example, Yurii Rashkovskii
presented a few examples of such changes, leading him to conclude, along with
several others in the community, that C API-using extensions can only be used
when built against the minor release with which they’re used.</p>
<p>In the Unconference session, core committers reported that such changes are
carefully made, and rarely, if ever, affect extensions compiled for different
minor releases of the same major version. Furthermore, they carefully make
such changes to avoid compatibility issues. In <a href="https://x.com/petervgeoghegan/status/1785720228237717627" title="Peter Geoghegan on Twitter: You must be referring to my commit 714780dc…">the case Yurii
found</a>, for example, a field was added to a struct’s padding,
without affecting the ordering of other fields, thus minimizing the risk of
runtime failures.</p>
<p>It became clear that, although the committers follow a policy — and read new
committers into it via patch review — it’s not documented anywhere. The
result has been a bunch of sturm und drang amongst extension developer unsure
what level of compatibility to depend on and what changes to expect.</p>
<p>The week after the conference, I started a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/flat/5DA9F9D2-B8B2-43DE-BD4D-53A4160F6E8D@justatheory.com" title="pgsql-hackers: Proposal: Document ABI Compatibility">pgsql-hackers thread</a> proposing to
document the committer policy. Following some discussion and review of
potential ABI breaks in minor releases, the consensus seemed to be that the
committers strive to avoid such breaks, that they’re quite uncommon in minor
releases, and that most of the reported issues were due to using more obscure
APIs.</p>
<p>As a result, we started drafting a policy, and after a few iterations, <a href="https://peter.eisentraut.org">Peter
Eisentraut</a> pulled things together from the perspective of a core team member,
reframed as “Server API and ABI Guidance”. I converted it into a <a href="https://commitfest.postgresql.org/48/5080/" title="Commitfest — Docs: API &amp; ABI Guidance">patch</a> (and
<a href="https://github.com/theory/postgres/pull/6" title="theory/postgres: Add API an ABI guidance to the C language docs">pull request</a>) to add it to the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/xfunc-c.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: C-Language Functions">C Language docs</a>. A key statement on minor
releases:</p>
  
    <blockquote>
      <p>In general, extension code that compiles and works with a minor release
should also compile and work with any other minor release of the same major
version, past or future.</p>
    </blockquote>
  
<p>I hope this document clarifies things. Even if it’s not as strict as some
might hope, it at least documents the project approach to compatibility, so we
have a better idea what to expect when using the C APIs. If you see gaps, or
you have additional questions, please respond to <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/flat/5DA9F9D2-B8B2-43DE-BD4D-53A4160F6E8D@justatheory.com" title="pgsql-hackers: Proposal: Document ABI Compatibility">pgsql-hackers thread</a> — or
the <a href="https://github.com/theory/postgres/pull/6" title="theory/postgres: Add API an ABI guidance to the C language docs">pull request</a> (I’ll propagate comments to hackers).</p>
