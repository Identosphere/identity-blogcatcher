<p>Happy birthday, Ma. I miss you.</p><p>This time last year I booked an AirBnb in Pacific Grove, right on the bay, because you had talked about wanting to visit Monterey and be by the water. It was a hard trip for you, but I’m so glad we did it.</p><p>I’m so glad we did a lot of things.</p><p>During the pandemic, I was with you most of the time. We had a ritual at the end of the night where I would help you walk up the six steps to your bedroom, help you into bed, and then help you brush your teeth if you weren’t feeling strong enough to do it in the bathroom. Sometimes, I would lie on the bed and we’d talk, although I know it eventually got too hard to hold up a conversation. I treasured those times. Most of all, I think about the hug we’d have at the top of the stairs; the feeling of your skin as I kissed your head.</p><p>I’m glad for the walks we would take in the small park near the house. I’d drive you down and pack your rolling walker with the built-in seat, and we’d stroll together, at your pace. Sometimes we’d just walk to the end of the road and back. But we’d talk and be together, just us. You’d ask me to time how long it took to get to the corner, and it was always shorter than you expected. You were so strong.</p><p>And even when you were tired and struggling, you were my mother. You worried that I worked too hard, and spent too long at work. At the time, I was frustrated with you; I’d fought hard to build a career from nothing. But what you were saying came from a place of love, and you were right. I’d fallen into a trap that a lot of people fall into, and you could see it. You worried about my health, my well-being, and my future, even when you had so much else to worry about.</p><p>I hear your advice every day. I try and live up to it and carry it with me. The last year has been untethered: after ten years of that journey with you, everything feels wrong. It’s like one of those movies where the protagonist wakes up and the world has changed around them in unsettling ways, but here there’s no key; there’s no way to get back. The mirror dimension is the world now. I’ve made weird knee-jerk decisions just to fill the void. I haven’t been exercising. I sleep poorly. I’m trying to practice what you wanted for me - it was all about being healthy, living a good life, standing up for myself and setting good boundaries - but right now I feel like I’m not there. I’m trying.</p><p>When we were lying on your bed, we talked a lot about how you wanted your death to go. We were all very clear about what you wanted, and I’m so sorry that it didn’t happen that way. You didn’t want to be in the hospital, surrounded by tubes and machines. You wanted to be in your home, surrounded by us. The hospital worked with us to bend the covid restrictions so we could all be with you, but we couldn’t take you home. You needed too much oxygen; I don’t remember if we explained that to you, but I hope we did. “It’s all happening so fast,” you told us. That last week was a waking nightmare and I wish I’d been smarter in it.</p><p>What happened next, in palliative care, will be with me for the rest of my life. I didn’t know how it would be. I don’t know if I (we) could have steered those last days to be different, but it was exactly what you didn’t want, and I’m going to be sorry forever. You were there for me in so many ways for so many years and then, when it really counted, I couldn’t give you what you needed. You didn’t have agency in the way you left. It’s unforgivable. I don’t know if I will ever get to a point where I can forgive myself, or if I should.</p><p>I hoped I would dream about you; that I’d get to talk to you in some form, even if I knew it was more me than you. I have dreamt about you, but every time, even now, you’ve been in pain. I just want to tell you I love you one more time. I want to tell you I’m sorry.</p><p>I have all these videos of you. We recorded your life story over a few different sessions, which I’m afraid to say I still haven’t stitched into one video and shared with everyone. Maybe I’ll do that today; it seems like a fitting celebration of your life. I have videos of you at your singing recitals - it’s still incredible to me that you joined a singing class post lung transplant. I even have two videos, one before your lung transplant and one more recently, of you telling me you love me. I’m glad to have them, and to hear your voice and remember. But playing them also feels like listening to an echo: another ripple from a giant hole that has been torn out of the universe.</p><p>You were so game. You made the decision to move to Europe when you were pregnant, because that would be a better place to raise a baby. You gave birth in a foreign country where you didn’t really speak the language, thousands of miles away from your family. And it worked; it all worked out. You moved to England and made Oxford your home, only moving back to California so you could help care for my Oma. I felt so privileged to do the same to help care for you; you had shown me the way. Life is an adventure: it’s exciting. We’re capable of doing, and dealing with, so much. A good life means building and enjoying and thriving on your own terms, not consuming some template that other people have set out for you. There’s no comfort in sameness.</p><p>You were amazing. So many people have families that value conformity, or wealth, or tradition. Mine valued humanity, ethics, and building a meaningful life from first principles. You modeled that for me incredibly from the moment I was born. My horizons were broad and my world was big. No idea was off-limits to discuss; nothing was off-limits to explore; you never told me to follow a set path or do something because that was just how it was done. You were never parochial; never petty or small-minded. You fought for equality before I was born, literally on the streets and in courtrooms, and fought for it in everything you did as I grew up. You were smart and fierce and kind and silly and patient and loving.</p><p>Thank you. I miss you. I love you. I’m sorry.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>

<p><a href="https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=what%27s+on%2Cwhat%27s+in&amp;year_start=1810&amp;year_end=2019&amp;corpus=0&amp;smoothing=3&amp;direct_url=t1%3B%2Cwhat%27s%20on%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cwhat%27s%20in%3B%2Cc0"></a></p>
<p>Throughout the entire history of what we call media, we have consumed its contents on producers’ schedules. When we wanted to know what was in newspapers and magazines, we waited until the latest issues showed up on newsstands, at our doors, and in our mailboxes. When we wanted to hear what was on the radio or to watch what was on TV, we waited until it played on our stations’ schedules. “What’s on TV tonight?” is perhaps the all-time most-uttered question about a medium. Wanting the answers is what made&nbsp;TV Guide&nbsp;required reading in most American households.</p>
<p>But no more. Because we have entered the Age of Optionality. We read, listen to, and watch the media we choose, whenever we please. Podcasts, streams, and “over the top” (OTT) on-edmand subscription services are replacing old-fashioned broadcasting. Online publishing is now more synchronous with readers’ preferences than with producers’ schedules.</p>
<p>The graph above illustrates what happened and when, though I’m sure the flat line at the right end is some kind of error on Google’s part. Still, the message is clear:&nbsp;what’s on and what’s in have become anachronisms.</p>
<p>The centers of our cultures have been held for centuries by our media. Those centers held in large part because they came on a rhythm, a beat, to which we all danced and on which we all depended. But now those centers are threatened or gone, as media have proliferated and morphed into forms that feed our attention through the flat rectangles we carry in our pockets and purses, or mount like large art pieces on walls or tabletops at home. All of these rectangles maximize optionality to degrees barely imaginable in prior ages and their media environments: vocal, scribal, printed, broadcast.</p>
<p><a href="https://dsearls.medium.com/what-does-the-internet-make-of-us-118421ac5e">We are now digital beings</a>. With new media overlords.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-markets-act-ensuring-fair-and-open-digital-markets_en">Digital Markets Act</a> in Europe calls these overlords “gatekeepers.” The gates they keep are at entrances to vast private walled gardens enclosing whole cultures and economies. Bruce Schneier <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2012/12/feudal_sec.html">calls these gardens feudal systems</a>&nbsp;in which we are all serfs.</p>
<p>To each of these duchies, territories, fiefs, and countries, we are like cattle from which personal data is extracted and processed as commodities. Purposes differ: Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Twitter, and our phone and cable companies each use our personal data in different ways. Some of those ways do benefit us. But our agency over how personal data is extracted and used is neither large nor independent of these gatekeepers. Nor do we have much if any control over what countless customers of gatekeepers do with personal data they are given or sold.</p>
<p>The cornucopia of options we have over the media goods we consume in these gardens somatizes us while also masking the extreme degree to which these private gatekeepers have enclosed the Internet’s public commons, and how algorithmic optimization of engagement at all costs has made us into enemy tribes. Ignorance of this change and its costs is the darkness in which democracy dies.</p>
<p>Shoshana Zuboff calls this development&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/29/opinion/sunday/facebook-surveillance-society-technology.html">The Coup We Are Not Talking About</a>. The subhead of that essay makes the choice clear:&nbsp;We can have democracy, or we can have a surveillance society, but we cannot have both. Her book,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Age_of_Surveillance_Capitalism">The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power</a>, gave us a name for what we’re up against. A bestseller, it is now published in twenty-six languages. But our collective oblivity is also massive.</p>
<p>We plan to relieve some of that oblivity by <a href="https://events.iu.edu/ostromworkshop/event/291452-beyond-the-web-salon-series-shoshana-zuboff">having Shoshana lead&nbsp;the final salon</a> in our <a href="https://ostromworkshop.indiana.edu/events/salon-series/index.html">Beyond the Web series</a> at Indiana University’s <a href="https://ostromworkshop.indiana.edu/">Ostrom Workshop</a>. To prepare for that, Joyce and I spoke with Shoshana for more than an hour and a half last night, and are excited about her optimism toward restoring the public commons and invigorating democracy in our still-new digital age. This should be an extremely leveraged way to spend an hour or more on April 11, starting at 2PM Eastern time. And it’s free.</p>

 One of the things a realtor will often do for you when you’re selling a house is to set up a website for it. It’s often built by the people who take the photos, and is created to a set template. It turns out there are a handful of services that exist to do just that: host a single-page site that showcases your home.

<p>I often listen to a podcast or read an article and at the end of it my reaction is 'yes … and' or 'yes … but’.</p>
<p>IF I feel sufficiently moved - a link might get posted to my&nbsp;<a href="https://john.philpin.com/surprise-me">Thought Stream</a>, together with a pithy observation - and I move on.</p>

The Thought Stream
<p>On the stream I offer a <a href="https://john.philpin.com/surprise-me">randomized link,</a> that takes you to one of the posts. the oldest of which dates back 2005! </p>

<p>Sometimes though&nbsp;… just sometimes&nbsp;… what I am reading or listening to, triggers more than a few synapses and I am prompted into writing something more substantial. This is one such occasion after I listened to ‘The Thoughtful Leader’ - a podcast hosted by Mindy Gibbins-Klein when she was talking with Steve Sanders.</p>
<p>Full disclosure - whilst I don’t really know either Mindy or Steve - we have talked, exchanged ideas and generally feel we are on the same playing field. All three of us happen to belong to a tight network that runs out of the UK, but in my language, I wouldn’t say I&nbsp;‘know’ either of them ‘well’ (yet), whatever that means. That said, they both come across as very good people that I will get to know better over time.</p>
<p>So to that podcast.</p>
<p>First - Mindy - my thanks for the People First call-out - at least that is how I am taking it 😀 … I know you weren’t connecting it to my work - but I’ll take whatever I can get - just like when Zuckerborg (sic) borrowed the phrase, I know he wasn’t talking about me - and in fact, I don’t believe him - but nothing wrong with pushing the image to remind people!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Steve - good job and on topic - as we explored when we recently talked. I think we might be cut from the same cloth, even though our suits might be different.</p>
<p>I certainly do not disagree with anything you said - but I do have a couple of observations.</p>
 One - Generational Differences 
<p>I agree on the challenge of focussing on generational differences. I know 15 years olds that are 80 and 80 years old that ‘remain’ teenagers. I get why business has this need for categorization - I reject that people need to adopt it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/10/18/its-time-to-stop-talking-about-generations">The New Yorker</a> seems to agree.</p>

Why do people adopt corporate language and thinking that is at odds with what is good for us?
<p>
For example;<br>I reject the use of that horrible corporate word ‘content’ that people spend so much time working to deliver into the platformed silos of LinkedIn, Facebook, TicToc, Snapchat, Instagram, What’s App and all the rest. <br>If your work is homogenous, un-differentiated, fodder written to feed the algorithm and garner clicks, hearts and whatever other little badge of honour the corporates regard us with - then perfect. <br>I would hazard a guess though that most creators don’t think that their posts, articles, essays, photographs, books, images, poems … are anything but that … but that is what we are reducing our IP to.<br>And of course, because anything that is an homogenized undifferentiated commodity - the price that gets paid is not on value - but how cheap an alternative might be.<br>.. and do not get me started on Marketing War Rooms! </p>

<p>But let’s keep the plot front and center.</p>
<p>I have been looking and commenting on these supposed generational differences for years and am not quite as optimistic as Steve when it comes to how fast this is going to change. More of that in a minute. But first - let me put my hand up in the air and emphasize that Steve is not alone in his optimism. Who am I to disagree with the findings of Accenture, who in <a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/strategy/reimagined-consumer-expectations">this report</a> seem to support the idea that we are moving towards this new world faster than any of us might think.</p>
<p><a href="https://estebankolsky.com/2022/03/30/reader-changing-consumer-motivations-expectations-accenture/">Esteban Kolsky</a> is one of the few analysts that picked up on the survey - and in his post reminded us of the vagaries of such surveys!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… “let’s say you are not truly convinced that they WILL actually do what they say they may in a survey (something about an unconscious bias towards being liked makes most of us answer as expected, not as the way we will act, etc.).”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He goes on with this advice …</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… “read while wearing rubber gloves and use thongs to “flip pages” if you want to avoid contact – hehe – but definitely read this about how consumers are changing, because outside of the flawed data-collection, the trend is real and well documented.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>…&nbsp;and it is my job as CCO (that’s ‘Chief Contrary Office’) not only to question the findings that were discovered when Accenture surveyed</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… “more than 25,000 consumers across 22 countries, with follow-up focus groups in five countries.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(I’ll forgive the language - it’s Accenture, they can’t help it, but I prefer to survey people.)</p>
<p>… but indeed anything that sits oddly that is, in turn, being shared under the banner ‘common wisdom’.</p>
<p>The bottom line is optimism. Don’t get me wrong - even I am optimistic, it’s just the speed of adoption that I am questioning - which brings me to part two.</p>
 Two - The Speed of Transformation 
<p>First, I hope I am wrong. But, the evidence I am seeing suggests different.</p>
<p>I could highlight so many examples that might suggest how slow this is going to be - but let’s choose three.</p>
 Supply Chain Inequality 
<p>We have been able to buy ‘$1 throw away ‘designer’ t-shirts’ for decades. Stores like <a href="https://www.primark.com">Primark</a> despite <a href="https://www.primark.com/en/primark-cares">pages like this</a> exist because when it comes to action - as opposed to feeling, we turn a blind eye.</p>
<p>Just think for two seconds about the profit behind a $1 t-shirt being sold in a large department store on Oxford Street and other cities around the world. It surely points to inequality and sometimes exploitation somewhere (if not everywhere) in the supply chain.</p>
<p>Exploitation that we all hate and rail against - but we are complicit in our purchase.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.influencerintelligence.com/blog/H4/what-we-know-about-primarks-talent-strategy">What age group does Primark serve</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>”Whilst in-store customers may differ slightly, Primark’s social audience fall within the 17–24-year age demographic (depending on platform) and are over 90% female.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The very age group that we are pinning our hopes and dreams on to change corporations.</p>
 Ease of Transaction over Moral Compass 
<p>Uber Eats, Doordash, GrubHub et al make their profits through food delivery.</p>
<p>The mechanics of the transaction has 30% of the food order at your favourite takeaway magically being extracted from the local economy - only to appear as revenue in a company in Oakland, California.</p>
<p>It’s clear. But we continue to do it.</p>
<p>So much for being aware of social issues and forcing corporations to change.</p>
<p>A similar argument can be applied to Uber itself because it is ‘oh so convenient - and cheap … even though even in London there are apps that compete like <a href="https://gett.com/uk/city/london/">Gett</a> … so people who ‘say’ they are demanding Corporations to do better - vote with their thumb when it comes to the short term benefit of saving a buck. Principles are gone!</p>
<p>Don’t believe me? <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2021/oct/30/black-cabs-roar-back-into-favour-as-app-firms-put-up-their-prices">Consider this</a> which headlines with;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Black cabs roar back into favour as app firms put up their prices.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile - over in the USA …</p>
<p><a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/03/28/dc-ag-sues-grubhub-for-sneaky-fees-screwing-over-local-restaurants/">DC AG Sues Grubhub For Sneaky Fees, Screwing Over Local Restaurants | Techdirt</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“But Grubhub didn’t fully cover the costs of these discounts. Instead, it passed most of the costs of the discounts along to the already-struggling restaurants. Grubhub also forced the restaurants to pay their full commission on the discounted orders based on non-discounted prices. This promotion severely cut into restaurants’ already-small profit margins, and misled DC residents who believed their orders through Grubhub would help their favourite restaurants.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yikes.</p>
<p>Where is the outrage? Where is the socially aware youth?</p>
 Cryptocurrency 
<p><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/11/11/16-of-americans-say-they-have-ever-invested-in-traded-or-used-cryptocurrency/">16% of Americans say they have ever invested in, traded or used cryptocurrency</a> - depending on which site you visit, the numbers vary for the US and in different countries, but there is no doubt that a lot of people have jumped onto the bandwagon - despite the apparent danger of it being a highly volatile gamble in something that I would guess (no science here), some 90% of those people could not even start to describe how cryptocurrency works.</p>
<p>But that isn’t what this bit is about. </p>
<p>Lets start with another podcast that asks <a href="https://overcast.fm/+Bv9ucDt1U">Can Our Climate Survive Bitcoin?</a> - it’s an hour long - but well worth a listen - and it contains some eye opening stories.</p>
<p>One of the many stories - American towns competing with each other to offer massively discounted power to ‘crypto miners’ where the workers earn $20 per hour, and the owners - well - it’s the usual story.</p>
<p>Scott Galloway nailed it in one of his pieces;</p>
<p></p>
<p>and</p>
<p></p>
 
<blockquote>
<p>“All animals are equal but some are more equal than others”</p>
 
 💬 George Orwell
  </blockquote>
 
<p>So how do you reconcile the crypto movement with the climate change crowd …</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… “almost half of all American men ages 18 to 29 say they have invested in, traded or used a form of cryptocurrency.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/marisadellatto/2021/11/11/cryptos-super-user-young-men-43-of-us-males-aged-18-to-29-have-bought-the-currency">SOURCE</a></p>
<p>Maybe its just that the ‘modern youth’ are massively intelligent …</p>
 
<blockquote>
<p>“The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function.”</p>
 
 💬 F. Scott Fitzgerald
  </blockquote>
 
<p>But I am not yet convinced.</p>
<p>No research yet - but as the funds spring up supporting this brave new crypto world and our children are apparently eschewing investment in the ‘extractive industries’ - we find this headline;</p>
<p><a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/single/2022-03-24-4">Exxon Mobil reportedly gets in on Bitcoin mining</a></p>
<p>Follow the money babe - follow the money.</p>
 Three - Altruism 
<p>Riddle me this … why are boomers generally seen as the ‘bad guys’. This just 5 days ago : <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/baby-boomers-greenhouse-gas-emissions-b2043755.html">Boomers responsible for nearly one third of greenhouse gas emissions, study suggests.</a>&nbsp;Really, do some google searching - it is clear that boomers are positioned as 'the problem'.</p>
<p>I have no idea how true that is (full disclosure - I am a boomer)</p>

But It Gets Worse
<p>
I am a Boomer<br>I am English<br>I am Male<br>I am Straight<br>I am White<br>Single handidly - most of the ills of the world might fall at my feet if you listen to the common narrative. </p>

<p>I do however know enough that the same data can produce very different conclusions.</p>
<p>But consider this;</p>
<p>Vint Cerf and Bob Metcalf’s work gave us TCP/IP - the internet wouldn’t work without that protocol</p>
<p>Tim &nbsp;Berners Lee’s work gave us the worldwide web.</p>
<p>So as to avoid confusion (and please note - this is a real image - not a photoshop .. I was there when it was taken.) …</p>
<p></p>
<p>Let’s write that in a different way.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Baby Boomers&nbsp;Vint Cerf (78) and Bob Kahn (83) hold the join honorary title of ‘Godfathers of The Internet’.&nbsp;Tim Berners-Lee (66) came up with the World Wide Web and&nbsp;none of them are millionaires in the ‘millionaire sense’ - and certainly not billionaires.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s also telling that I more than likely need to provide context as to who these people are - but that when we move on to other generations, no explanation is necessary. We just somehow know their names.</p>
<p>Jeff Bezos at 58 sits at the cusp of Boomer and GenX, the other names you will be familiar with include;</p>
 GenX 
<p>Jack Dorsey (45)<br>Sergey Brin (48)<br>Larry Page (49)<br>Elon Musk (50)</p>
 Millenial 
<p>Mark Zuckerberg (37)<br>Evan Spiegel (31)<br>Zhang Yiming (38)</p>
<p>The web was created by Berner-Lee as a place of equality - where everyone had a publishing press and/or microphone - if they chose to use them.</p>
<p>But the money was made by ‘post boomers’.</p>
<p>The cesspit of corruption, bias and fake news - Fakebook was created by a millennial. The other one, Twitter, by a GenXer.</p>
<p>I could write it another way;</p>
<p>Boomers created the internet and the web and did not turn themselves into money-grubbing billionaires - like GenX and Millenials do today.</p>
<p>Now, who’s destroying the world?</p>
 Bottom Line 
<p>No matter the indignation we feel, or how loud our screams for a fairer society, the fact is that when it comes down to it, the further that happens from your wallet and/or physical presence - the more easily it is forgotten - or even ignored.</p>
<p>The t-shirt situation occurs because they are made on the other side of the world - too far away for me to affect. Besides - if I don’t buy them - others will - what difference does what I do make?</p>
<p>Uber, is an identical situation - except the person you are now stealing (what word would you use) from might be your neighbour!</p>
<p>And it is all because people, on the whole, do not understand. They don’t think - why should they - life is too busy!</p>
<p>As a result, corporations will continue as they do and won’t be challenged as they transition their businesses into spaces to make even more money - at whatever cost.</p>
<p>Yes - there are exceptions. Consider <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patagonia,_Inc.">Patagonia</a>, a retailer that takes its values to heart. Revenues of <a href="https://www.zoominfo.com/c/patagonia-inc/134316518">$1Billion</a> - not chump change - but that’s less than <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/490869/primark-operating-profit-worldwide/">Primark’s pre Covid annual profits</a> - interesting to note that Arthur Ryan who founded Primark is of the Silent Generation as is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yvon_Chouinard">Yvon Chouinard</a> who founded Patagonia.</p>
<p>If we are really going to compare generations through the lens of ‘business oligarchs’ - it looks like the world might have got better with Boomers - and it has been going downhill ever since!</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>And, this is all written with a bit of tongue in cheek because I do so object to behavioural classification based on age.</p>
<p>But it’s also asking why we think everything is suddenly going to be different - and different quick - just because we hear how ‘woke’ and ‘aware’ the youth are - when it comes to global challenges. ‘the youth’ are coming to save us.</p>
<p>You might not remember the sixties (if you do - you probably ‘weren’t there’), but that generation had hopes, ideals and aspirations. They were also going to &nbsp;change the world for the better. Did they? Was it for the better?</p>
<p>To borrow a ‘sign off’ from my friend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Moore">Geoff Moore</a> - that’s what I think … what do you think?</p>

<p>The photo above dates from early 1978, when Hodskins Simone &amp; Searls, a new ad agency, was born in Durham, North Carolina. Specifically, at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/8mCa2WWXodDkqKwo7">602 West Chapel Hill Street</a>. Click on that link and you’ll see the outside of our building. Perhaps you can imagine the scene above behind the left front window, because that’s where we stood, in bright diffused southern light. Left to right are David Hodskins, Ray Simone, and me.</p>
<p>That scene, and the rest of my life, were bent toward all their possibilities by a phone call I made to Ray one day in 1976, when I was working as an occasionally employed journalist, advertising guy, comedy writer, radio voice, and laborer: anything that paid, plus plenty that didn’t. I didn’t yet know Ray personally, but I loved the comics he drew, and I wanted his art for an ad I had written for a local audio shop. So I called him at the “multiple media studio” where he was employed at the time. Before we got down to business, however, he also got into an off-phone conversation with another person in his office. After Ray told the other person he was on the phone with <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2017/04/26/where-the-nickname-came-from/">Doctor Dave</a> (the comic radio persona by which I was known around those parts back then), the other person told Ray to book lunch with me at a restaurant downtown.</p>
<p>I got there first, so I was sitting down when Ray walked in with a guy who looked like an idealized version of me. Not just better looking, but radiating charisma and confidence. This was the other person who worked with Ray, and who told Ray to propose the lunch. That’s how I met David Hodskins, who used the lunch to recruit me as a copywriter for the multiple media studio. I said yes, and after a few months of that, David decided the three of us should start Hodskins Simone &amp; Searls. Four years and as many locations later, we occupied a whole building in Raleigh, had dozens of people working for us, and were the top ad agency in the state specializing in tech and broadcasting.</p>
<p>A couple years after that we seemed to be hitting a ceiling as the alpha tech agency in a region still decades away from becoming the “other Silicon Valley” it wanted to be. So, after one of our clients said “Y’know, guys, there’s more action on one street in Sunnyvale than there is in all of North Carolina,” David flew out to scout Silicon Valley itself. That resulted in a tiny satellite office in Palo Alto, where David prospected for business while running the Raleigh headquarters by phone and fax. After a year of doing that, David returned, convened a dinner with all the agency managers, and said we’d have to close Palo Alto if he didn’t get some help out there. This was in August 1985.</p>
<p>To my surprise, I heard myself volunteering duty out there, even though a year earlier when David asked me to join him there I had said no. I’m not even sure why I volunteered this time. I loved North Carolina, had many friends there, and was well established as a figure in the community, mostly thanks to my Doctor Dave stuff. I said I just needed to make sure my kids, then 15 and 12, wanted to go. (I was essentially a single dad at the time.) After they said yes, we flew out and spent a week checking out what was for me an extremely exotic place. But the kids fell instantly in love with it. So I rented a house near downtown Palo Alto, registered the kids in Palo Alto junior and high schools, left them there with David, flew back to North Carolina, gave away everything that wouldn’t fit in a small U-Haul trailer, and towed my life west in my new 145-horse ’85 Camry sedan with a stick shift. With my Mom along for company, we crossed the country in just four days.</p>
<p>The business situation wasn’t ideal. Silicon Valley was in a slump at that time. “For Lease” banners hung over the windows new buildings all over the place. Commodore, Atari, and other temporary giants in the new PC industry were going down. Apple, despite the novelty of its new Macintosh computer, was in trouble. And ad agencies—more than 200 of them—were fighting for every possible account, new and old. Worse, except for David, me, and one assistant, our whole staff was three time zones east of there, and the Internet that we know today was decades away in the future. But we bluffed our way into the running for two&nbsp;of the biggest accounts in review.</p>
<p>As we kept advancing in playoffs for those two accounts, the North Carolina office was treading water and funds were running thin. In our final pitches, we were also up against the same incumbent agency: one that, at that time, was by far the biggest and best in the valley, and did enviably good work. So we were not the way to bet. The evening before our last pitch, David told Ray and me that we needed to win both accounts or retreat back to North Carolina. I told him that I was staying, regardless, because I belonged there, and so did my kids, one of whom was suddenly an academic achiever and the other a surfer who totally looked the part. We had gone native. David reached across the table to shake my hand. That was his way of saying both “Thanks” and “I respect that.”</p>
<p>Then we won both accounts, got a mountain of publicity for having come out of nowhere and kicked ass, and our Palo Alto office quickly outgrew our Raleigh headquarters. Within a year we had closed Raleigh and were on our way to becoming one of the top tech agencies in Silicon Valley. None of this was easy, and all of it required maximal tenacity, coordination, and smarts, all of which were embodied in, and exemplified by, David Hodskins. He was wickedly smart, tough, creative, and entrepreneurial: perfect for leading a small and rapidly growing company. While hard-driving and often overbearing (sometimes driving Ray and me nuts) he was also great fun to work and hang out with, and one of the best friends I’ve ever had.</p>
<p>One of our bondings was around basketball. David was a severely loyal Duke alumnus and grandfathered with two season tickets every year to games at the Duke’s famous Cameron Indoor Stadium. I became a Duke fan as his date for dozens of games there. When we moved to Palo Alto, he and I got our basketball fix through season tickets to the Golden State Warriors. (In the late ’80s, this was still affordable for normal people.) At one point, we even came close once to winning the Warriors’ advertising business.</p>
<p>In the early 90s, I forked my own marketing consulting business out of HS&amp;S, while remaining a partner with the firm until it was acquired by Publicis in 1998. By then I had also shifted back into journalism as an editor for Linux Journal, while also starting to blog. (Which I’m still doing right here.) David, Ray, and I remained good friends, however, while all three of us got married (Ray), remarried (David and I), and had California kids. In fact, I had met my wife with Ray’s help in 1990.</p>
<p>Ray died of lung cancer in 2011, at just 63. I remember him in <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2011/11/29/remembering-ray/">this post here</a>, and every day of my life.</p>
<p>On November 13 of last year, my wife and I attended the first game of the season for the Indiana Univesity Men’s basketball team, which David and I had rooted against countless times when they played Duke and other North Carolina teams. While there, I took a photo of the scene with my phone and sent it in an email to David, saying “Guess where I am?” He wrote back, “Looks suspiciously like Assembly Hall in Bloomington, Indiana, where liberals go to die. WTF are you doing there?”</p>
<p>I explained that Joyce and I were now visiting scholars at IU. He wrote back,</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. visiting scholar,</p>
<p>Recuperating from a one-week visit by (a friend) and his missus, before heading to Maui for T’giving week.</p>
<p>The unwelcome news is that I’m battling health issues on several fronts: GERD, Sleep Apnea, Chronic Fatigue, and severe abdominal pain. Getting my stomach scoped when I’m back from Maui, and hoping it isn’t stomach cancer.</p>
<p>Actual retirement is in sight… at the end of 2022. (Wife) hangs it up in February, 2024, so we’ll kick our travel plans into higher gear, assuming I’m still alive.</p>
<p>Already sick of hearing that coach K has “5 national titles, blah, blah, blah” but excited to see Paulo Banchero this year, and to see Jon Scheyer take the reins next year. Check out the drone work in this promotional video:&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/Dp1dEadccGQ" title="https://youtu.be/Dp1dEadccGQ">https://youtu.be/Dp1dEadccGQ</a></p>
<p>Thanks for checking in, and glad to hear you’re keeping your brain(s) active. Please don’t become a Hoosier fan.</p>
<p>d</p></blockquote>
<p>David’s ailment turned out to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis">ALS</a>. After a rapid decline too awful to describe, he died last week, on March 22nd. Two days earlier I sent him a video telling him that, among other things, he was the brother I never had and a massive influence on many of the lives that spun through his orbits. Unable to speak, eat or breathe on his own, he was at least able to smile at some of what I told him, and mouth “Wow” at the end.</p>
<p>And now there is just one left: the oldest and least athletic of us three. (Ray was a natural at every sport he picked up and won medals in fencing. David played varsity basketball in high school. Best I ever got at that game was not being chosen last for my college dorm’s second floor south intramural team.)</p>
<p>I have much more to think, say, and write about David, especially since he was a source of wisdom on many subjects. But it’s hard because his being gone is so out of character.</p>
<p>But not completely, I suppose. Hemmingway:</p>
<blockquote><p>The world breaks everyone and afterward many are strong at the broken places. But those that will not break it kills. It kills the very good and the very gentle and the very brave impartially. If you are none of these you can be sure it will kill you too but there will be no special hurry.</p></blockquote>
<p>My joke about aging is that I know I’m in the exit line, but I let others cut in. I just wish this time it hadn’t been David.</p>
<p>But the line does keep moving, while the world holds the door.</p>

  <p>Summary:      PKI has created a global trust framework for the web. But the war in Ukraine has shone a light on its weaknesses. Hierarchies are not good architectures for building robust, trustworthy, and stable digital systems.</p>




<p>
    Each semester I have students in my distributed systems class read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B004M8SR2O/windleyofente-20">Rainbow's End</a>, a science fiction book by Vernor Vinge set in the near future. I think it helps them imagine a world with vastly distributed computing infrastructure that is not as decentralized as it could be and think about the problems that can cause. One of the plot points involves using certificate authorities (CA) for censorship. 
</p>

<p>
    To review briefly, certificate authorities are key players in public key infrastructure (PKI) and are an example of a core internet service that is <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2015/01/re-imagining_decentralized_and_distributed.shtml">distributed and hierarchical</a>. Whether your browser trusts the certificate my web server returns depends on whether it trusts the certificate used to sign it, and so on up the certificate chain to the root certificate. Root certificates are held in browsers or operating systems. If the root certificate isn't known to the system, then it's not trusted. Each certificate might be controlled by a different organization (i.e. they hold the private key used to sign it), but they all depend on confidence in the root. Take out the root and the entire chain collapses. 
</p>

<p>
    The war in Ukraine has made hypothetical worries about the robustness of the PKI all too real. Because of the sanctions imposed on Russia, web sites inside Russia can't pay foreign CAs to renew their certificates. Modern browsers don't just shrug this off, but issue warnings and sometimes even block access to sites with expired certificates. So, the sanctions threaten to cripple the Russian web. 
</p>

<p>
    In response, Russia has <a href="https://medium.com/coinmonks/russia-establishes-its-own-tls-certificate-authority-to-avoid-sanctions-a8221b72b729">established its own root certificate authority</a> (see also <a href="https://www.keyfactor.com/blog/russia-creates-its-own-certificate-authority-ca-to-issue-tls-certificates/">this from KeyFactor</a>). This is not merely a homegrown CA, located in Russia, but a state-operated CA, subject to the whims and will of the Russian government (specifically the Ministry of Digital Development).
</p>

<p>
    This is interesting from several perspectives. First, from a censorship perspective, it means that Russia can effectively turn off web sites by revoking their certificates, allowing the state to censor web sites for any reason they see fit. Hierarchical networks are especially vulnerable to censorship. And  while we might view state-controlled CAs as a specific problem, any CA could be a point of censorship. Recall that while SWIFT is a private company, it is located in Belgium and subject to Belgian and European law. Once Belgium decided to sanction Russia, <a href="https://econofact.org/swift-sanction-on-russia-how-it-works-and-likely-impacts">SWIFT had to go along</a>. Similarly, a government could pass a law mandating the revocation of any certificate for a Russian company and CAs subject to their legal jurisdiction would go along. 
</p>

<p>
    From the perspective of users, it's also a problem. Only two browsers support the root certificate of the new Russian CA: the Russian-based Yandex and open-source Atom.  I don't think it's likely that Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Brave, Edge, and others will be adding the new Russian root CA anytime soon. And while you can add certificates manually, most people will find that difficult. 
</p>

<p>
    Lastly, it's a problem for the Russian economy. The new Russian CA is a massive single point of failure, even if the Russian government doesn't use it to censor. Anonymous, state actors, and other groups can target the new CA and bring large swaths of the Russian internet down. So, state-controlled and -mandated CAs are a danger to the economy they serve. Russia's actions in response to the exigency of the war are understandable, but I suspect it won't go back even after the war ends. Dependence on a single state-run CA is a problem for Russia and its citizens. 
</p>

<p>
    State-controlled CAs further balkanize the internet. They put web sites at risk of censorship. They make life difficult for users. They create centralized services that threaten economic stability and vibrancy. In general, hierarchies are not good architectures for building robust, trustworthy, and stable digital systems. PKI has allowed us to create a global trust framework for the web. But the war in Ukraine has shone a light on its weaknesses. We should heed this warning to engineer more decentralized infrastructures that give us confidence in our digital communications.

<p>This article shows how to implement an API service and client in separate ASP.NET Core applications which are secured using Azure application permissions implemented in an Azure App registration. The OAuth client credentials flow is used to get an access token to access the API. Microsoft.Identity.Web is used to implement the client credentials (CC) flow.  Microsoft.Identity.Client can also be used to implement this flow, or any OAuth client implementation.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/AzureADAuthRazorUiServiceApiCertificate/tree/main/BlazorWithApis">BlazorWithApis</a></p>



<p>The OAuth client credentials flow can be used to access services, where no user is involved and the client is trusted. This flow is used in many shapes and forms in Azure. The client application requires some type of secret to get an access token to use the secured API. In Azure, there are different ways of implementing this which vary in different names and implementations. The main difference with most of these implementations is how the secret is acquired and where it is stored. A certificate can be used as the secret or an Azure App registration secret. This secret can be stored in Azure Key Vault. Managed identities provide another way of implementing app to app secured access between Azure services and can be used to acquire access tokens using the Azure SDK. Certificate authentication can also be used to secure this security flow. This can be a little bit confusing, but as a solution architect, you need to know when and where this should be used, and not.</p>



<p>Delegated user access tokens or application client credential tokens</p>



<p>As a general rule, always use delegated user access tokens and not application access tokens if possible. You can reduce the permissions per user to the max. To acquire a user delegated access token, an identity must login somewhere using a UI. A user interaction flow is required for this. The delegated user access token can be requested using a scope for the identity. In Azure AD, the On Behalf Flow OBO can also be used to acquire further delegated user access tokens for downstream APIs. This is not possible in Azure AD B2C.</p>



<p>Scopes or Roles Permissions</p>



<p>In Azure, scope permissions are used for delegated user access tokens, not application permissions. App Roles can be used for application and / or delegated access. Roles can only be defined in Azure AD App registrations and not Azure AD B2C App registrations. To define an Azure App registration with application App Roles, you need to use an Azure AD App registration. This is very Azure specific and nothing to do with security standards. You still request a scope when using delegated or application flows, but not scope permissions when using application OAuth client credentials. More information about this can be found in the Microsoft docs:</p>



<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/scenario-protected-web-api-verification-scope-app-roles?tabs=aspnetcore">Protected web API: Verify scopes and app roles</a></p>



<p>By using application security permissions, you give the client application permissions for whatever is allowed in the service. No user is involved. This cannot be reduced for different users, only for different client applications.</p>



<p>Azure App Registration setup</p>



<p>The hardest part of implementing an API protected using application permissions is to know how and where to setup the Azure App registration. The Azure App registration needs to be created in an Azure AD app registration and not an Azure AD B2C tenant, even if you use this. The Azure App registration needs an application ID URI, make sure this is created.</p>







<p>An Azure App Role can be created and can be validated in the access token. </p>







<p>The app role is defined as an application type. I named the role access_as_application.</p>







<p>The role can be added as a permission and admin consent can be given. This will be included in tokens issued for this Azure app registration.</p>







<p>API setup</p>



<p>The API is setup using the Microsoft.Identity.Web. The AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApiAuthentication adds the OAuth validation using the configuration from the app settings. I created an authorization policy to implement the authorization which is applied to the controller or as a global filter. I think this is the best way as it is the standard way in ASP.NET Core. You should avoid using the Azure claims directly in the business of the application. Microsoft.Identity.Web also provides some specific Azure helper methods which checks consent or validates the scope etc. It is important that only access tokens intended for this API should work and all other access tokens must be rejected. </p>


  services.AddSingleton&lt;IAuthorizationHandler, HasServiceApiRoleHandler&gt;();

services.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApiAuthentication(Configuration);

services.AddControllers();

services.AddAuthorization(options =&gt;
{
	options.AddPolicy("ValidateAccessTokenPolicy", validateAccessTokenPolicy =&gt;
	{
		validateAccessTokenPolicy.Requirements.Add(new HasServiceApiRoleRequirement());

		// Validate id of application for which the token was created
		// In this case the UI application 
		validateAccessTokenPolicy.RequireClaim("azp", "2b50a014-f353-4c10-aace-024f19a55569");

		// only allow tokens which used "Private key JWT Client authentication"
		// // https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens
		// Indicates how the client was authenticated. For a public client, the value is "0". 
		// If client ID and client secret are used, the value is "1". 
		// If a client certificate was used for authentication, the value is "2".
		validateAccessTokenPolicy.RequireClaim("azpacr", "1");
	});
});
  


<p>Using Microsoft.Identity.Web</p>



<p>One way of implementing a client is to use Microsoft.Identity.Web. The client and user of the application uses the OpenID Connect Code flow and a secret with some Azure specifics and once authenticated, the application can request an application token using the ITokenAcquisition interface and the GetAccessTokenForAppAsync method. The scope definition uses the /.default value with the application ID URL from the Azure App registration. This uses the client credentials flow. If the correct parameters are used, an access token is returned and the token can be used to access the API.</p>


  public class ServiceApiClientService
{
    private readonly IHttpClientFactory _clientFactory;
    private readonly ITokenAcquisition _tokenAcquisition;

    public ServiceApiClientService(
        ITokenAcquisition tokenAcquisition,
        IHttpClientFactory clientFactory)
    {
        _clientFactory = clientFactory;
        _tokenAcquisition = tokenAcquisition;
    }

    public async Task&lt;IEnumerable&lt;string&gt;?&gt; GetApiDataAsync()
    {
        var client = _clientFactory.CreateClient();

        // CC flow access_as_application" (App Role in Azure AD app registration)
        var scope = "api://b178f3a5-7588-492a-924f-72d7887b7e48/.default"; 
        var accessToken = await _tokenAcquisition.GetAccessTokenForAppAsync(scope);

        client.BaseAddress = new Uri("https://localhost:44324");
        client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", accessToken);
        client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Accept.Add(new MediaTypeWithQualityHeaderValue("application/json"));

        var response = await client.GetAsync("ApiForServiceData");

        if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
        {
            var stream = await response.Content.ReadAsStreamAsync();

            var payload = await JsonSerializer.DeserializeAsync&lt;List&lt;string&gt;&gt;(stream);

            return payload;
        }

        throw new ApplicationException("oh no...");
    }
}
  


<p>Notes</p>



<p>When using client applications and the client credentials flow, it is important to only share the secret or certificate with a trusted client. The client should implement this is a safe way so that it does not get stolen. If I own the client, I deploy the client to Azure (if possible) and use a Key Vault to persist the certificates or secrets. A managed identity is used to access the key vault. This way, no secret is stored in an unsecure way. Try to use delegated access tokens rather than application tokens. The delegated access token is issued to the user and the application and the authorization can be reduced. This can only be done if using a user interaction flow to authenticate. Azure App registrations use scopes for delegated access tokens and roles can be used for application permissions. With app to app flows, other ways also exist for securing this access.</p>

  <p>Datasette 0.61, a Twitter Space and a new Datasette plugin for authenticating against Auth0.</p>
 datasette-auth0 
<p>I've been figuring out how best to integrate with <a href="https://auth0.com/">Auth0</a> for account management and sign-in, for a project I'm working on with <a href="https://blog.natbat.net/">Natalie</a>.</p>
<p>I used Auth0 for <a href="https://github.com/CAVaccineInventory/vial">VIAL</a> with Vaccinate CA last year, following the <a href="https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/webapp/django/01-login">Auth0 Django tutorial</a> using <a href="https://python-social-auth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Python Social Auth</a>.</p>
<p>This time I decided to try and do it from first principles rather than use a library, for reasons I discussed in <a href="https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1507847567454851076">this Twitter thread</a>.</p>
<p>It turns out Auth0 is using regular OAuth 2, which can be implemented from scratch in just three steps:</p>
 
 Generate a URL to a page on Auth0 that will display the login screen 
 Implement a page that handles the redirect back from Auth0, which needs to exchange the code from the <code>?code=</code> parameter for an access token by POSTing it to an authenticated API endpoint 
 Use that access token to retrieve the authenticated user's profile 
 
<p>I wrote up the steps in this TIL: <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/auth0/oauth-with-auth0">Simplest possible OAuth authentication with Auth0</a></p>
<p>Since it turned out to be pretty straight-forward, I turned it into a new authentication plugin for Datasette: <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-auth0">datasette-auth0</a>.</p>
<p>You can try that out with the live demo at <a href="https://datasette-auth0-demo.datasette.io/">datasette-auth0-demo.datasette.io</a> - click on the top right menu icon and select "Sign in with Auth0".</p>
<p></p>
<p>The live demo is deployed automatically any time a push to the <code>main</code> branch passes its tests. I've implemented this pattern a few times now, so I wrote it up in another TIL: <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/github-actions/deploy-live-demo-when-tests-pass">Deploying a live Datasette demo when the tests pass</a>.</p>
 Datasette 0.61.0 (and 0.61.1) 
<p>I wrote about these in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Mar/24/datasette-061/">the annotated weeknotes</a>. They were pretty significant releases, representing <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/compare/0.60.2...0.61.1">86 commits</a> since 0.60.2 released back in January.</p>
 New features as documentation 
<p>Some of my favourite feature requests for my projects are ones that can be solved by documentation. I had a great example of that this week.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils/issues/420">#420: Transform command with shared context</a> Mehmet Sukan wanted a way to speed up the following operation using <code>sqlite-utils insert --convert</code> - described in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Jan/11/sqlite-utils/">What’s new in sqlite-utils 3.20 and 3.21</a>:</p>
  cat items.json | jq '.data' | sqlite-utils insert listings.db listings - --convert '
d = enchant.Dict("en_US")
row["is_dictionary_word"] = d.check(row["name"])
' --import=enchant --ignore  
<p>The <code>--convert</code> option lets you specify Python code that will be executed against each inserted item. Mehmet's problem was that the <code>enchant.Dict("en_US")</code> operation is quite expensive, and it was being run every time around the loop.</p>
<p>I started looking into ways to speed this up... and realized that there was already a mechanism for doing this, but it was undocumented and I hadn't previously realized it was even possible!</p>
<p>The recipe that works looks like this:</p>
  echo '[
  {"name": "notaword"},
  {"name": "word"}
]' | python3 -m sqlite_utils insert listings.db listings - --convert '
import enchant
d = enchant.Dict("en_US")

def convert(row):
    global d
    row["is_dictionary_word"] = d.check(row["name"])
'  
<p>The result:</p>
  % sqlite-utils rows listings.db listings        
[{"name": "notaword", "is_dictionary_word": 0},
 {"name": "word", "is_dictionary_word": 1}]  
<p>This takes advantage of a feature of the <code>sqlite-utils</code> Python snippet mechanism, which <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils/blob/95522ad919f96eb6cc8cd3cd30389b534680c717/sqlite_utils/utils.py#L308-L342">is implemented here</a>. It first attempts <code>exec()</code> against the provided code to see if it defined a <code>convert(value)</code> function - if that fails, it composes a function body (to cover simple expressions like <code>row["ok"] = True</code>).</p>
<p>So I got to close the issue by <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/latest/cli.html#using-a-convert-function-to-execute-initialization">adding some documentation</a> showing how to do this!</p>
<p>Another, smaller example this week: when I figured out <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/shot-scraper/readability">Extracting web page content using Readability.js and shot-scraper</a> I learned that Playwright can accept and execute <code>async () =&gt; {...}</code> functions, enabling this pattern:</p>
  shot-scraper javascript https://simonwillison.net/2022/Mar/24/datasette-061/ "
async () =&gt; {
  const readability = await import('https://cdn.skypack.dev/@mozilla/readability');
  return (new readability.Readability(document)).parse();
}"  
<p>So I <a href="https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper/commit/8d103ae6121031ea7a8799fcac4d2d2dcf8525a2">added that pattern</a> to the <code>shot-scraper</code> documentation.</p>
 SQLite Happy Hour Twitter Space 
<p>I hosted my first Twitter Space. The recording and notes can be found in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Mar/23/sqlite-happy-hour/">SQLite Happy Hour—a Twitter Spaces conversation about three interesting projects building on SQLite</a>.</p>
<p>I also learned how to download the audio of a Twitter Spaces in two different ways, as documented in my TIL on <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/twitter/export-edit-twitter-spaces">Exporting and editing a Twitter Spaces recording</a>.</p>

<p>While walking past this scene on my way to the subway in New York last week, I saw that a woman was emptying out what hadn’t burned from this former car. Being a curious extrovert, I paused to ask her about it. The conversation, best I recall:</p>
<p>“This your car?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. What happened?”</p>
<p>“Somebody around here sets fire to bags of garbage*. One spread to the car.”</p>
<p>“Any suspects?”</p>
<p>“There are surveillance cameras on the building.” She gestured upward toward two of them.</p>
<p>“Did they see anything?”</p>
<p>“They never do.”</p>
<p>So there you have it. In medicine they call this kind of thing a&nbsp;fascinoma. Perhaps in civic life we should call this an&nbsp;arsonoma. Or, in law enforcement, a&nbsp;felonoma.</p>
 
<p>*In New York City, we now put out garbage and recycling in curbside bags.</p>

<p>This article shows how to onboard new users into your ASP.NET Core application using Azure B2C as the identity provider and the account management. The software has application specific persisted user data and this user data needs to be connected to the identity data from the corresponding user in Azure B2C. </p>



<p>Code <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/azureb2c-fed-azuread">https://github.com/damienbod/azureb2c-fed-azuread</a></p>



<p>User Case where user is created first in the application</p>



<p>The users are created in the ASP.NET Core application from an administrator. Once the use is created, an email is sent to the new user. The user clicks the link in the application and signs up in Azure AD B2C. After the account has been created in Azure AD B2C, the user is redirected back to the application and the Azure B2C account gets connected to the persisted user in the database automatically persisting the Azure AD object identifier (oid) claim data. The account is activated in the application, the authorization definitions are created automatically and applied as defined by the administrator user in the first step.</p>



<p>It is not possible to onboard a new user in Azure B2C like this using Microsoft Graph without managing passwords. You should never mail passwords to users. For the flow to work, the signin signup user flow can be used from Azure B2C. The link sent to the user requires authentication and contains a registration one time code. When the user clicks the link, authentication is required and so the user is automatically redirected to Azure B2C. After a successfully signup, the user is redirected back to the application and the registration code is used to connect the accounts. At no stage did the application administrator need to manage the user passwords from the accounts. Because default Azure B2C flows are used, it should be easy to applied the latest best practices supported by Azure B2C for user authentication, once this gets rolled out. FIDO2 is not supported by Azure AD B2C which is bad as this is the strongest MFA.</p>



<p>The create user can be implemented using an ASP.NET Core Razor page. This Razor page requires authentication and an admin policy. The form sends a post request with the user data and if valid, the data is saved to the database using Entity Framework Core. A random registration code is generated and persisted and saved in the user entity. An email is created and the ConnectAccount URL is used with the registration code. This URL is emailed to the end user using Microsoft Graph. An office license is required for the email client to work but you can use any email service. The user now exists and should have mail in their inbox. (or spam) If you are implementing this in a production application, you will need to implement a resend email function and I would update the registration code with each email. </p>


  public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; OnPostAsync()
{
	if (!ModelState.IsValid)
	{
		return Page();
	}

	if (!_userService.IsEmailValid(UserModel.Email))
	{
		ModelState.AddModelError("Email", "Email is invalid");
		return Page();
	}

	var user = await _userService.CreateUser(new UserEntity
	{
		Email = UserModel.Email,
		FirstName = UserModel.FirstName,
		Surname = UserModel.Surname,
		BirthDate = UserModel.BirthDate,
		DisplayName = UserModel.DisplayName,
		PreferredLanguage = UserModel.PreferredLanguage
	});

	await _userService.SendEmailInvite(user, Request.Host, false);

	OnboardingRegistrationCode = user.OnboardingRegistrationCode;
	return OnGet();
}
  


<p>The SendEmailInvite method sends an email using the Microsoft Graph client.</p>


  public async Task SendEmailInvite(UserEntity user, HostString host, bool updateCode)
{
	if (updateCode)
	{
		user.OnboardingRegistrationCode = GetRandomString();
		await _userContext.SaveChangesAsync();
	}

	var accountUrl = $"https://{host}/ConnectAccount?code={user.OnboardingRegistrationCode}";
	var header = $"{user.FirstName} {user.Surname} you are invited to signup";
	var introText = "You have been invite to join the MyApp services. You can register and sign up here";
	var endText = "Best regards, your MyApp support";
	var body = $"Dear {user.FirstName} {user.Surname} \n\n{introText} \n\n{accountUrl} \n\n{endText}";
	var message = _emailService.CreateStandardEmail(user.Email, header, body);

	await _msGraphEmailService.SendEmailAsync(message);
}
  


<p>The user service creates a user in the SQL database and generates the random code.</p>


  public async Task&lt;UserEntity&gt; CreateUser(UserEntity userModel)
{
	userModel.OnboardingRegistrationCode = GetRandomString();

	await _userContext.AddAsync(userModel);
	await _userContext.SaveChangesAsync();

	return userModel;
}
  


<p>The create user ASP.NET Core Razor page just displays a simple form for adding the properties required by your business.</p>







<p>The MsGraphEmailService class implements the Microsoft Graph email service. This client needs to authorize using an Azure tenant which has an office license for the sender account. The application permissions also need to be enabled for the Azure App registration used. This works fine as long as you do not send loads of emails, the amount of mails you can send is limited and you do not want to send many emails anyway. The Azure SDK ClientSecretCredential is used which setups the client credentials flow and uses an application scope from the Azure App registration.

    {

        _graphServiceClient = new GraphServiceClient(clientSecretCredential, scopes);

        var meetingOrganizer = _configuration["AzureAdEmailService:EmailSender"];
        var filter = $"startswith(userPrincipalName,'{meetingOrganizer}')";

        var users = await _graphServiceClient.Users
            .Request()
            .Filter(filter)
            .GetAsync();

        return users.CurrentPage[0].Id;
    }

    public async Task SendEmailAsync(Message message)
    {
        var saveToSentItems = true;

        var userId = await GetUserIdAsync();

        await _graphServiceClient.Users[userId]
            .SendMail(message, saveToSentItems)
            .Request()
            .PostAsync();
    }
}
  


<p>The email is sent as defined in the create user. The email is really simple and has the link to the ConnectAccount Razor page and the registration code. This is not a link direct to the Azure B2C signup as we want to automatically connect the user data from the application to the Azure B2C identity and assign the defined authorization. It is very easy to make a template for this email and translate it into the user language or add company information etc.</p>







<p>When the end user opens the email and clicks the link, the user opens the connect account link with the registration code. This URL requires authentication and is automatically redirected to the Azure B2C signin signup flow. We need to use this user flow, because in some cases the user already exists in Azure B2C and not in the application and this user would just signin then.</p>







<p>The ConnectAccount Razor page handles the GET requests and connects the authenticated identity with the user in the database if the registration code matches. Normally a GET should never change the state. This Razor page must be protected. If the registration code matches, the OID from the Azure B2C account is persisted and the registration code reset. The user account is set to active. If authorization is pre-defined for this user, then the authorization definitions can be created for the user as well. Once connected, the user can be redirected to the profile Razor page.</p>


  [Authorize]
public class ConnectAccountModel : PageModel
{
    private readonly UserService _userService;

    public ConnectAccountModel(UserService userService)
    {
        _userService = userService;
    }

    [BindProperty]
    public string? OnboardingRegistrationCode { get; set; } = string.Empty;

    public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; OnGet([FromQuery] string code)
    {
        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(code))
        {
            return Page();
        }

        var email = User.Claims.FirstOrDefault(c =&gt; c.Type == "emails")?.Value;
        var oidClaimType = "http://schemas.microsoft.com/identity/claims/objectidentifier";
        var oid = User.Claims.FirstOrDefault(t =&gt; t.Type == oidClaimType)?.Value;

        if(oid == null)
            return Page();

        int id = await _userService.ConnectUserIfExistsAsync(
            code, oid, true, email);

        if(id &gt; 0)
        {
            return Redirect("/profile");
        }

        return Page();
    }
  


<p>The profile page allows the user to update data which is controlled by the user. I do this in the application and do not user the Azure B2C profile because this is application specific. This is sensitive data and needs to be handled correctly. I display the OID, IsActive and the email here, but this data must not be updated in the profile page. This user data can only be managed by an application administrator. I also create and new user profile for a user, if the user does not exist but already has an Azure B2C account. This account can signin but will see nothing as the identity has no authorization to view anything. The authorization is set by an application administrator. By allowed this, existing Azure B2C accounts can be onboarded as well.</p>

<p>The Profile Razor page allows the user to update the profile data after authenticating using Azure B2C.</p>







<p>Notes</p>



<p>Onboarding and user registration in any software system needs to be robust and flexible. Because a separate identity provider is used, the application specific user data needs to be mapped to the identity profile data. The onboarding process needs to be flexible and user friendly. You also need to support account reset and account update processes, for example when a user changes email. Try to use a system which makes it easy to support, or force MFA for you users like FIDO2. At present, Azure B2C does not support strong MFA. It is not recommended to use SMS but even this is way better than only password.</p>

  <p>I released <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-61">Datasette 0.61</a> this morning - closely followed by <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-61-1">0.61.1</a> to fix a minor bug. Here are the annotated release notes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In preparation for Datasette 1.0, this release includes two potentially backwards-incompatible changes. Hashed URL mode has been moved to a separate plugin, and the way Datasette generates URLs to databases and tables with special characters in their name such as <code>/</code> and <code>.</code> has changed.</p>
 
 URLs within Datasette now use a different encoding scheme for tables or databases that include "special" characters outside of the range of <code>a-zA-Z0-9_-</code>. This scheme is explained here: <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/internals.html#internals-tilde-encoding">Tilde encoding</a>. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1657">#1657</a>) 
 Removed hashed URL mode from Datasette. The new <code>datasette-hashed-urls</code> plugin can be used to achieve the same result, see <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/performance.html#performance-hashed-urls">datasette-hashed-urls</a> for details. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1661">#1661</a>) 
 
</blockquote>
<p>I talked about these changes <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Mar/19/weeknotes/">in my weeknotes</a>. These are two major steps forward towards Datasette 1.0, in that implementing them removed a lot of code and complexity from Datasette core.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Datasette also now requires Python 3.7 or higher.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>0.60 was the final release to work with Python 3.6, which ended security support <a href="https://pythonspeed.com/articles/stop-using-python-3.6/">last December</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
 
 Databases can now have a custom path within the Datasette instance that is independent of the database name, using the <code>db.route</code> property. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1668">#1668</a>) 
 
</blockquote>
<p>This was the last change I made before the 0.61 release, and turned out to have <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1682">a severe bug</a> which prompted me to release 0.61.1 shortly afterwards.</p>
<p>I needed the feature in order to implement the <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/performance.html#performance-hashed-urls">datasette-hashed-urls</a> plugin.</p>
<p>That plugin works by modifying the URL relating to a database in order to incorporate the SHA-256 hash of that database's contents. This allows all JSON and HTML pages within that database to set a far-future cache header, providing a huge performance boost especially if run behind a caching proxy such as Cloudflare.</p>
<p>Initially it worked by changing the display name of the database too, but <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-hashed-urls/issues/8">Forest Gregg pointed out</a> that exposing all of those hashes in the UI was a pretty poor user experience.</p>
<p>So I decided to split the "route" (the URL to the database - "path" was already in use as the path to the file on disk) from the unique name used to refer to the database internally.</p>
<p>I caught almost all of the places in the code that needed to be updated, but shortly after shipping 0.61 I noticed that Forest had <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-hashed-urls/issues/13">filed issues</a> relating to the one place I had missed!</p>
<p>Those fixes are out now, and <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-hashed-urls/releases/tag/0.3">datasette-hashed-urls 0.3</a> should work as advertised.</p>
<blockquote>
 
 Datasette is now covered by a <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">Code of Conduct</a>. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1654">#1654</a>) 
 
</blockquote>
<p>It's good open source governance to have one of these. I decided to adopt the <a href="https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct/">Contributor Covenant</a> because it reflected my own values for the project and is used by a <a href="https://www.contributor-covenant.org/adopters/">large number of projects</a> that I trust.</p>
<blockquote>
 
 Python 3.6 is no longer supported. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1577">#1577</a>) 
 Tests now run against Python 3.11-dev. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1621">#1621</a>) 
 
</blockquote>
<p>I didn't test Datasette against Python 3.10 before it came out and was <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Oct/9/finding-and-reporting-a-bug/">distressed to find an asyncio bug</a> that caused errors with the project after that version of Python was released!</p>
<p>I'm not going to let that happen again, so Datasette's test suite now runs against the 3.11 developer preview. Here's <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/github-actions/python-3-11">my TIL</a> about how I set that up.</p>
<blockquote>
 
 New <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/internals.html#datasette-ensure-permissions">datasette.ensure_permissions(actor, permissions)</a> internal method for checking multiple permissions at once. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1675">#1675</a>) 
 New <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/internals.html#datasette-check-visibilty">datasette.check_visibility(actor, action, resource=None)</a> internal method for checking if a user can see a resource that would otherwise be invisible to unauthenticated users. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1678">#1678</a>) 
 
</blockquote>
<p>These two new permissions APIs came out of <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1660">a larger effort</a> to refactor and simplify Datasette's core views.</p>
<p>Datasette's <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/blob/0.60.2/datasette/views/base.py#L56-L101">BaseView class included permission logic</a>. I'm trying to shrink that superclass down to the point where I can remove it entirely, and I also wanted to make that permission logic available to plugins as well. Moving those methods into the documented <code>Datasette</code> class felt like a good way to achieve that.</p>
<blockquote>
 
 Table and row HTML pages now include a <code>&lt;link rel="alternate" type="application/json+datasette" href="..."&gt;</code> element and return a <code>Link: URL; rel="alternate"; type="application/json+datasette"</code> HTTP header pointing to the JSON version of those pages. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1533">#1533</a>) 
 
<code>Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Link</code> is now added to the CORS headers, allowing remote JavaScript to access that header. 
 
</blockquote>
<p>The idea behind this change originated with my experimental work on the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-notebook">datasette-notebook</a> plugin, which aims to implement a combination wiki-dashboard system for Datasette. Development of that plugin is stalled for the moment.</p>
<p>I wanted to build a feature where you could paste in a URL to a Datasette query or filtered table and the plugin would then embed and display the results of that query on a page.</p>
<p>To support this, I built an experimental Web Component, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/datasette-table">datasette-table</a>, and published it to npm (<a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/npm/publish-web-component">TIL</a>).</p>
<p>The problem I needed to solve was this: given a URL, how can I tell that it corresponds to a Datasette table or query? Especially if that URL might be hosted on a separate website entirely (why not support embedding Datasette tables from other instances?)</p>
<p>My solution was an HTTP header. You can now make a <code>HEAD</code> request against a Datasette page and, if it corresponds to a table or view, you'll get back a <code>Link: ... rel="alternate"</code> header pointing to the JSON version of that page.</p>
<p>Here's an example using <code>curl</code>:</p>
 <code>~ % curl -I https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures/facetable
HTTP/2 200 
link: https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures/facetable.json; rel="alternate"; type="application/json+datasette"
cache-control: max-age=5
referrer-policy: no-referrer
access-control-allow-origin: *
access-control-allow-headers: Authorization
access-control-expose-headers: Link
content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8
</code> 
<p>I'm looking forward to building interesting features against this in the future.</p>
<blockquote>
 
 Canned queries are now shown at the top of the database page, directly below the SQL editor. Previously they were shown at the bottom, below the list of tables. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1612">#1612</a>) 
 
</blockquote>
<p>Jacob Fenton <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1612">suggested this</a>. Canned queries were previously listed at the very bottom of <a href="https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures">the database page</a>, below the list of tables. They're now shown at the top. I think this is a big improvement!</p>
<blockquote>
 
 Datasette now has a default favicon. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1603">#1603</a>) 
 
</blockquote>
<p>I originally created this in Figma, and then <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/pixelmator/pixel-editing-favicon">hand-edited it in Pixelmator</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
 
 
<code>sqlite_stat</code> tables are now hidden by default. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1587">#1587</a>) 
 SpatiaLite tables <code>data_licenses</code>, <code>KNN</code> and <code>KNN2</code> are now hidden by default. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1601">#1601</a>) 
 
</blockquote>
<p>SQLite and SpatiaLite occasionally use automatically created tables to power some of their functionality. These aren't very interesting to regular users, so Datasette omits them from view by default on the homepage.</p>
<p>I have an open issue for <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1403">Labels explaining what hidden tables are for</a> since the current UI leads to legitimate questions from users who click on the "show hidden tables" link!</p>
<blockquote>
 
 SQL query tracing mechanism now works for queries executed in <code>asyncio</code> sub-tasks, such as those created by <code>asyncio.gather()</code>. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1576">#1576</a>) 
 
<a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/internals.html#internals-tracer">datasette.tracer</a> mechanism is now documented. 
 
</blockquote>
<p>This was the impetus for dropping support for Python 3.6.</p>
<p>The tracer mechanism powers the debugging feature that shows all of the SQL queries that were executed to produce a page (<a href="https://latest-with-plugins.datasette.io/?_trace=1">demo here</a>).</p>
<p>I've been experimenting with ways to run some of these queries in parallel, taking advantage of <code>asyncio</code>. But the tracer mechanism wasn't correctly tracking these, because queries executed in additional <code>asyncio</code> tasks were not being correctly bundled together.</p>
<p>The Python standard library <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextvars.html">contextvars</a> module provides a neat way to solve this, but it was introduced in Python 3.7. So I finally bit the bullet and dropped 3.6.</p>
<blockquote>
 
 Common Datasette symbols can now be imported directly from the top-level <code>datasette</code> package, see <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/internals.html#internals-shortcuts">Import shortcuts</a>. Those symbols are <code>Response</code>, <code>Forbidden</code>, <code>NotFound</code>, <code>hookimpl</code>, <code>actor_matches_allow</code>. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/957">#957</a>) 
 
</blockquote>
<p>This means plugins can now do <code>from datasette import Response</code>, where previously they had to use <code>from datasette.utils.asgi import Response</code>.</p>
<p>I've long been frustrated that Django makes me remember where to import things from - so now Datasette lets the most commonly imported stuff (counted by running grep against my own plugins) from the root of the package.</p>
<blockquote>
 
 
<code>/-/versions</code> page now returns additional details for libraries used by SpatiaLite. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1607">#1607</a>) 
 
</blockquote>
<p>You can see <a href="https://calands.datasettes.com/-/versions">a demo of that here</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
 
 Documentation now links to the <a href="https://datasette.io/tutorials">Datasette Tutorials</a>. 
 
</blockquote>
<p>I wrote about these new tutorials <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Feb/27/datasette-tutorials/">a few weeks ago</a>.</p>
<p>And the rest:</p>
<blockquote>
 
 Datasette will now also look for SpatiaLite in <code>/opt/homebrew</code> - thanks, Dan Peterson. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/pull/1649">#1649</a>) 
 Fixed bug where <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/custom_templates.html#custom-pages">custom pages</a> did not work on Windows. Thanks, Robert Christie. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1545">#1545</a>) 
 Fixed error caused when a table had a column named <code>n</code>. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1228">#1228</a>)

  <p>Yesterday I hosted SQLite Happy Hour. my first conversation using Twitter Spaces. The idea was to dig into three different projects that were doing interesting things on top of SQLite. I think it worked pretty well, and I'm curious to explore this format more in the future.</p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1504604448202518529">the tweet</a> that initially promoted the space:</p>

<p>Twitter Spaces recorded audio only lasts for 30 days, so I've exported the audio and shared it <a href="https://soundcloud.com/simon-willison/sqlite-happy-hour-22nd-march-2022">on SoundCloud</a> as well.</p>

 Collaborative notes from the session 
<p>Something I've observed in Twitter Spaces I've joined in the past is that they can really benefit from a dedicated back-channel, to share links and allow audience participation without people needing to first request to speak.</p>
<p>A trick I've used with online talks I've given in the past is to start a collaborative Google Doc to collect shared notes and questions. I tried this for the Twitter Space, and it worked really well!</p>
<p>You <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ykZdd-Q_PF21N239T7EolOFSM-dHJUjjM2NVP5K26oQ/edit#">see that document here</a>. During the session the document was open for anyone to edit - I've locked it down now that the session has ended.</p>
<p>I've duplicated the final form of the document at the bottom of this post.</p>
<p>Something I really like about this format is that it allows for additional material to be posted later. I spent some time adding more detailed answers to the questions about Datasette after the session had ended.</p>
 Thoughts for if I do this again 
<p>This was my first time hosting a space, and I learned a lot along the way.</p>
<p>Firstly, this kind of thing works the best when there is a back and forth between the participants.</p>
<p>My original idea was to have each project talk for ten minutes, then spend five minutes on discussion between the panel before moving on to the next project - and 15 minutes of open discussion at the end.</p>
<p>My co-hosts suggested we try to make it more conversational, interrupting each other as we went along. We did that, and it worked much better: these conversations are far more interesting as a conversation than a monolog.</p>
<p>I still don't have a great feel for when to interrupt people in an audio-only conversation, since unlike an in-person panel there are no visual clues to go off!</p>
<p>Techology: it turns out Twitter Spaces has wildly different functionality on web v.s. mobile apps. We spent the first five minutes making sure all of our speakers could talk! We really should have done a tech rehearsal first, but I wasn't sure how to do that without accidentally broadcasting it to the world - maybe setup burner Twitter accounts for testing?</p>
<p>Presenting audio-only is itself a challenge: I'm used to leaning on visual demos when I explain what Datasette is in a talk, and not having those to fall back on was challenging. I had jotted down notes on the main points I wanted to hit which certainly helped, but I think there's a whole new presenting skill here that I need to work harder to develop.</p>
<p>Exporting the recorded audio from Twitter was frustrating but possible. I wrote some notes on how I did that <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/twitter/export-edit-twitter-spaces">in this TIL</a>.</p>

 Riffle 
<p>Geoffrey Litt <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffreylitt">@geoffreylitt</a>, Nicholas Schiefer <a href="https://twitter.com/nschiefer">@nschiefer</a></p>
<p>Riffle asks: what if you wrote your whole UI as a query over a local database? So far, we've built a prototype using SQLite and React. More background in this paper:</p>
<p><a href="https://riffle.systems/essays/prelude/">Building data-centric apps with a reactive relational database</a></p>
<p>Research project goal is to make development simpler, as opposed to the ongoing trend of more complexity.</p>
<p>Riffle looks at having a database-centric mechanism at the heart of the view. Declarative queries could make apps easier to understand and debug.</p>
<p>SQLite is the tool used for the prototype.</p>
<p>Local first architecture: Ink &amp; Switch have been promoting this. Return to a world where you local client device serves as a source of truth - you can access data offline etc - and when the network is available your data gets synced to the cloud.</p>
<p>The prototype: a reactive layer that uses SQLite as a state management backend for React, using <a href="https://sql.js.org/#/">https://sql.js.org/</a> which compiles SQLite in WASM. Also built prototypes of desktop apps using <a href="https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri">https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri</a> - like Electron but using the system web browser instead of bundling its own.</p>
<p>Since they control the writes, they can re-execute every query after any writes happen. SQLite is so fast that this works fine, queries all take under a ms and even with a thousand queries you can still run them all.</p>
<p>ALL UI state is in the database - there's no local React component state - literally everything is in the database. This means all UI state is persistent by default.</p>
<p>IndexedDB is used for the in-browser persistence. The Tauri desktop app stores to a file on disk. Maybe SQL.js could do that with the new Chrome filesystem API stuff too?</p>
<p>Questions about Riffle:</p>
 
 
<p>Will Riffle target vanilla JS, or Node.js?</p>
 
 It's running client-side, so vanilla JS 
 
 
 
<p>From Stephen: What about browser-native UI state like scroll position, URL path, query string, multiple independent browser tabs, etc?</p>
 
 Great question. We do some syncing of browser-native state to put it in the DB: eg, to support virtualized list rendering we update scroll state in the DB with an event handler. But there's definitely some browser state that isn't being captured reliably. In the purest world, the pixels on your screen would be produced by a DB query :) 
 
 
 
<p>From Predrag Gruevski: Would "query the queries" be a viable approach for narrowing the set of queries that need to be re-executed after a given write? Simple example: if table X gets modified, query for all queries that have table X in a FROM clause, then re-execute them.</p>
 
 yeah, that's roughly the direction we're headed. It's a little trickier than that if you start having subqueries / materialized view, but good general idea 
 
 
 
<p>From Longwei Su: Right now, each db update will cause a whole refresh. Is there any plan to refine the binding? So that any db update will only trigger UI component that "subscribe" to this section of the data. Sqlite have trigger, which can have callback on record update. How to construct that  "publisher"-&gt; "subscriber" mapping from sql query?</p>
 
 
<p>Comments for Riffle:</p>
 
 
<p>From Jesse - <a href="http://web.dev/file-system-access/">http://web.dev/file-system-access/</a> isn't a very rich api - I think you could persist to it, but I don't think you can seek/update/.../all the posix stuff sqlite probably needs</p>
 
 
<p>Hasura <a href="https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/blob/master/architecture/live-queries.md">documented</a> how they do reactive queries with Postgres, might be useful for minimising refetch overhead?</p>
 
 
 Datasette 
<p>Simon Willison <a href="https://twitter.com/simonw">@simonw</a></p>
<p><a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a> is an open source multi-tool for exploring and publishing data. It explores SQLite as a read-only mechanism for publishing structured data online in as flexible a manner as possible, and aims to build an ecosystem of plugins that can handle a wide range of exploratory data analysis challenges.</p>
<p>Video introduction here: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Feb/7/video/">https://simonwillison.net/2021/Feb/7/video/</a></p>
<p>Questions about Datasette:</p>
 
 
<p>How does it compares with <a href="https://github.com/dinedal/textql">https://github.com/dinedal/textql</a>, it seems the same but instead of sqlite binaries, just raw csv files which are more ubiquitous, and easier to view and edit with with office software (msf excel, libreoffice calc) ?</p>
 
 sqlite-utils memory provides similar functionality: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Jun/19/sqlite-utils-memory/">https://simonwillison.net/2021/Jun/19/sqlite-utils-memory/</a>
 
 
 
 
<p>Does Datasette need to worry about SQLite's <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/security.html">Defense Against the Dark Arts</a> security guidelines?</p>
 
 Yes, absolutely! I've put a lot of work in there. Most importantly, Datasette enforces a time limit on queries, which cuts them off if they take more than a second. 
 
 
 
<p>The SQLite3 docs are sometimes light on examples for the tricky stuff (e.g., enabling WAL). What's your best sort of info beyond the official docs?</p>
 
 I've been publishing my own notes here: <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/sqlite">https://til.simonwillison.net/sqlite</a>
 
 The SQLite Forum is amazing - I ask questions on there and often get a reply from the maintainers within a few hours: <a href="https://sqlite.org/forum/forummain">https://sqlite.org/forum/forummain</a>
 
 
 
 
<p>From Predrag Gruevski: Regarding learning curve, is a GraphQL web IDE (with syntax highlighting / autocomplete etc.) sufficiently user-friendly for folks more comfortable with a spreadsheet than a CLI tool or SQL?</p>
 
 Probably not! GraphQL requires thinking like a programmer too. I'm interested in helping people who aren't yet ready to learn any kind of programming language 
 I have a plugin for Datasette that adds GraphQL with the GraphiQL user interface - demo here: <a href="https://datasette-graphql-demo.datasette.io/graphql/github?query=%7B%0A%20%20issue_comments%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20totalCount%0A%20%20%20%20pageInfo%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20hasNextPage%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20endCursor%0A%20%20%20%20%7D%0A%20%20%20%20nodes%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20html_url%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20issue_url%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20id%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20node_id%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20created_at%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20updated_at%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20author_association%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20body%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20reactions%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20performed_via_github_app%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20user%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20id%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20name%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%7D%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20issue%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20id%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20title%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%7D%0A%20%20%20%20%7D%0A%20%20%7D%0A%7D">datasette-graphql-demo.datasette.io</a>
 
 Thanks! Would love to compare notes on this -- my experience from working with analysts at my employer was that they were able to master GraphiQL very quickly. In a sense, it was more intimidating than actually difficult, so working with them directly to get them over the initial difficulty hump via examples and targeted exercises made a huge positive impact. 
 
 
 
 Litestream 
<p>Ben Johnson <a href="https://twitter.com/benbjohnson">@benbjohnson</a></p>
<p><a href="https://litestream.io/">Litestream</a> adds replication to SQLite, allowing databases to be cheaply replicated to storage systems such as S3. Litestream also now implements live read-replication, where many read replicas can be run against a single leader database.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sqlite.org/np1queryprob.html">https://www.sqlite.org/np1queryprob.html</a> - Many Small Queries Are Efficient in SQLite</p>
<p>Questions about Litestream:</p>
 
 
<p>What does the planned hot standby feature look like, especially regarding durability guarantees during fail-over?</p>
 
 BJ: Hot standby is a tough issue to generalize. The database-as-a-service version of Litestream that's coming will handle this but it's not necessarily planned for Litestream) 
 
 
 
<p>Will DBaaS be hosted, OSS, or both?</p>
 
 It'll be both 
 
 
 
<p>From Longwei Su: I assume offline update will be commit locally then sync with the online storage. If there is a offline commit that conflict with the online version(that already committed in). How to resolve the conflict?</p>
 
 
<p>Not sure if this relates to Litestream but; how big is sql.js --- how much does it cost (in kilobytes) to load sqlite in the browser?</p>
 
 BJ: I think sql.js is 1.2MB so the cost depends on how much your provider charges for bandwidth 
 Thanks! Meant "cost" in the sense of bytes transferred over wire --- this answers it :)

   <p>As a human I know we all have biases, and we all have different biases. We expose certain biases based on context, time, and people. We know that bias forms because of experience, and we are sure that social context reinforces perceived inconstancy.&nbsp; Bias is like a mirror and can show our good and bad sides.</p><p>As a director, you have to have experience before taking on the role, even as a founder director. This thought-piece asks if we know where our business biases start from and what direction of travel they create. Business bias is the bias you have right now that affects your choice, judgment and decision making. Business bais is something that our data cannot tell us. Data can tell me if your incentive removes choice or aligns with an outcome.&nbsp;</p><p>At the most superficial level, we know that the expectations of board members drive decisions.&nbsp; The decisions we take link to incentives, rewards and motivations and our shared values.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>If we unpack this simple model, we can follow (the blue arrows in the diagram below) that says your expectation builds shared values that focus/highlight the rewards and motivations (as a group) we want. These, in turn, drives new expectations.</p><p>However, equally, we could follow (the orange arrows) and observe that expectations search and align with rewards and motivations we are given; this exposes our shared values that create new expectations for us.&nbsp;</p><br><p></p><br><p>Whilst Individual bias is complex; board or group bias adds an element of continuous dynamic change. We have observed and been taught this based on the “forming storming norming performing” model of group development first proposed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Tuckman">Bruce Tuckman in 1965</a>, who said that these phases are all necessary and inevitable for a team to grow face up to challenges, tackle problems, find solutions, plan work, and deliver results.</p><br><p></p><p>The observation here is that whilst we might all follow the Tuckman ideals of “time”; in terms of the process to get to perfroming, of which there is lots of data to support, his model ignores the process of self-discovery we pass through during each phase, assuming that we align during the storming (conflicts and tensions) phase but ignore that we fundamentally have different approaches.&nbsp; Do you follow the blue of orange route and from where did you start.</p><p>This is non-more evident than when you get a “board with mixed experience”, in this case, the diversity of experience is a founder, family business and promoted leader. The reason is that if you add their starting positions to the map, we tend to find they start from different biased positions and may be travelling in different directions.&nbsp; Thank you to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/claudia-heimer-0057821/">Claudia Heimer</a> for stimulating this thought. &nbsp;The storming phase may align the majority round the team but will not change the underlying ideals and biases in the individuals, which means we don’t explose the paradoxes in decision making.&nbsp;</p><p></p><br><p>What does this all mean? As a CDO, we are tasked with finding data to support decisions? Often leadership will not follow the data, and we are left with questions. Equally, some leaders blindly follow the data without questioning it. Maybe it is time to collect smaller data at the board to uncover how we work and expose a bias in our decision making.</p><br><br><br><br>

  <p>Summary:      Our online relationships are almost all transactional. A purely transaction digital life can't feel as rich and satisfying as one based on interactional relationships. As more of our relationships are intermediated by technology, finding ways to support interactional relationships will allow us to live authentic digital lives.</p>




<p>
    We don't build identity systems to manage identities. Rather <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml">we build identity systems to manage relationships</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Given this, we might rightly ask what kind of relationships are supported by the identity systems that we use. Put another way, what kind of online relationships do you have? If you're like me, the vast majority are transactional. Transactional relationships focus on commercial interactions, usually buying and selling, but not always that explicit. Transactional relationships look like business deals. They are based on reciprocity. 
</p>

<p>
    My relationships with Amazon and Netflix are transactional. That's appropriate and what I expect. But what about my relationships on Twitter? You might argue that they are between friends, colleagues, or even family members. But I also classify them as transactional.
</p>

<p>
    My relationships on Twitter exist within Twitter's administrative control and they facilitate the relationship in order to monetize it. Even though you’re not directly participating in the monetization and may even be unaware of it, it nevertheless colors the kind, frequency, and intimacy of the interactions you have. Twitter is building their platform and making product decisions to facilitate and even promote the kinds of interactions that provide the most profit to them. Your attention and activity are the product in the transaction. What I can do in the relationship is wholly dependent on what Twitter allows.
</p>

<p>
    Given this classification, the bulk of our online relationships are transactional, or at least commercial. Very few are what we might call interactional relationships. Except for email. Email is one of the bright exceptions to this landscape of transactional, administrated online relationships. If Alice and Bob exchange emails, they both have administrative, transactional relationships with their respective email providers, but the interaction does not necessarily take place within the administrative realm of a single email provider. Let's explore what makes email different. 
</p>

<p>
    The most obvious difference between email and many other systems that support online relationships is that email is based on a protocol. As a result:
</p>

 
 The user picks and controls the email server—With an email client, you have a choice of multiple email providers. You can even run your own email server if you like.   

 Data is stored on a server "in the cloud"—The mail client needn't store any user data beyond account information. While many email clients store email data locally for performance reasons, the real data is in the cloud. 

 Mail client behavior is the same regardless of what server it connects to—As long as the mail client is talking to a mail server that speaks the right protocol, it can provide the same functionality. 

 The client is fungible—I can pick my mail client on the basis of the features it provides without changing where I receive email.  

 I can use multiple clients at the same time—I can use one email client at home and a different email client at work and still see a single, consistent view of my email. I can even access my mail from a Web client if I don't have my computer handy. 

 I can send you email without knowing anything but your email address.—none of the details about how you receive and process email are relevant to me. I simple send email to your address. 

 Mail servers can talk to each other across ownership boundaries—I can use Gmail, you can use Yahoo! mail and the mail still gets delivered. 

 I can change email providers easily or run my own server.—I receive email windley.org even though I use Gmail. I used to run my own server. If Gmail went away, I could start running my own server again. And no one else needs to know.  

 

<p>
    In short, email was designed with the architecture of the internet in mind. Email is decentralized and protocological. Email is open—not necessarily open-source—but open in that anyone can build clients and servers that speak its core protocols: IMAP and SMTP. As a result, email maximizes freedom of choice and minimizes the chance of disruption. 
</p>

<p>
    The features and benefits that email provides are the same ones we want for every online relationship. These properties allow us to use email to create interactional relationships. The important insight is that systems that support interactional relationships can easily support transactional ones as well, where necessary. But the converse is not true. Systems for building transactional relationships don't readily support interactional ones. 
</p>

<p>
    I believe that email's support for richer relationships is a primary reason it has continued to be used despite the rise of social media and work platforms like Slack and Teams. I'm not saying email is the right platform for supporting modern, online interactional relationships—it's not. Email has obvious weaknesses, most prominently it doesn't support mutual authentication of the parties to a relationship and therefore suffers from problems like SPAM and phishing attacks. Less often noted, but equally disqualifying is that email doesn't easily lend itself to layering other protocols on top of if—creative uses of MIME notwithstanding. 
</p>

<p>
    I've been discussing <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2022/03/provisional_authenticity_and_functional_privacy.shtml">appropriate support for authenticity and privacy</a> in the last few posts, a key requirement for interactional relationships on the internet. A modern answer to interactional relationships has to support all kinds of relationships from pseudonymous, ephemeral ones to fully authenticated ones. <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/11/didcomm_and_the_self-sovereign_internet.shtml">DIDComm is a good candidate</a>. DIDComm  has the beneficial properties of email while also supporting mutual authentication for relationship integrity and layered protocols for flexible relationship utility. These properties provide an essential foundation for building rich online relationships that feel more life-like and authentic, provide better safety, and allow people to live effective online lives.

Nik Badminton set the scene and led a discussion with myself, James Hursthouse and Kharis O’Connell. Here are seven reflections.</p>  Games are a playful way to explore who we are, to process and interact with people in a way we can’t do IRL. Games are a way to try on other identities, to create or adjust our mental map of the&nbsp;world.  Companies won’t protect me. I’m concerned we are not fully aware of the data that can be tracked with VR hardware. From a quantified self perspective, I would love to know more information about myself to be a better human; but I don’t trust companies. Companies will weaponize any scrap of data to manipulate you and I into buying something (advertising), and even believing something that isn’t true (disinformation).  Privacy for all. We need to shift thinking around privacy and security. It’s not something we each should individually have to fight for — for one of us to have privacy, all of us must have privacy. <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202201/the-metaverse-a-missed-opportunity-for-data-ownership-and-privacy">I wrote some longer thoughts in this&nbsp;article.</a>  Capitalism needs Commons. Capitalism can’t exist without a commons to exploit. And commons will dry up if they are not replenished or created anew. So we need to support the continuity and creation of commons. Governments traditionally are in the role of protecting commons. But people can come together to create common technological languages, like technology standards to enable interoperable technology “rails” that pave the way for an open marketplace.  We need new business models. The point of a business model is profit first. This bias has created the current set of problems. In order to solve the world’s problems, we must wean ourselves off profit as the primary objective. I’m not saying that making money isn’t important, it is. But profit at all costs is what has got us into the current set of world problems.  Appreciate the past. I’m worried too much knowledge about how we’ve done things in the past is being lost. But not everything needs to go into the future. Identify what has worked and keep doing it. Identify what hasn’t worked and iterate to improve on it. This is how you help build on the past and contribute to the&nbsp;future.  Things will fail. There is a lot of energy (and money) in the Metaverse, and I don’t see it going away. That said, there will be failures. If the experimentation fails, is that so bad? In order to understand what is possible, we have to venture a bit into the realm of what’s impossible.  <p>Watch the whole video for the thought-provoking conversation.</p><p>Thank you to Nik, Kharis, James and everyone at the Vancouver International Privacy &amp; Security&nbsp;Summit!</p>

<p>I did invest some time in <a href="https://datasette.io/tools/shot-scraper">shot-scraper</a> this week, which I wrote about on this blog in detail earlier:</p>
 
 
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Mar/14/scraping-web-pages-shot-scraper/">Scraping web pages from the command line with shot-scraper</a> describes the new <code>shot-scraper javascript URL script</code> command, which lets you fire up a web page in a headless browser, execute some custom JavaScript against it to extract information and return that information as JSON to the command-line. This is a really cool trick! It turns <code>shot-scraper</code> into more than just a screenshotting tool: it now doubles up as the command line scraping tool I've been wanting for years. 
 
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Mar/14/shot-scraper-template/">Instantly create a GitHub repository to take screenshots of a web page</a> describes <a href="https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper-template">shot-scraper-template</a> - a GitHub repository template I created that lets people easily create a new repository that takes screenshots of a web page using <code>shot-scraper</code> running in GitHub Actions. 
 
<p>That GitHub repository trick really took off. Searching for <code>shot-scraper-template -user:simonw path:.github/workflows</code> on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/search?q=shot-scraper-template+-user%3Asimonw+path%3A.github%2Fworkflows&amp;type=code">now returns</a> 50 repositories that people other-than-me have created using the template!</p>
<p>It also caused me to revisit my template repositories for generating <a href="https://github.com/simonw/click-app-template-repository">Python Click apps</a>, <a href="https://github.com/simonw/python-lib-template-repository">Python libraries</a> and <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-plugin-template-repository">Datasette plugins</a>: all three of those now use a new pattern which avoids the user having to manually rename a folder in order to enable the GitHub Actions workflows - <a href="https://github.com/simonw/python-lib-template-repository/issues/2">details here</a>.</p>
 The big refactor, finally under way 
<p>The remaining work to do for Datasette 1.0 concerns stability. I want to make sure the JSON API and the plugin hooks are in a state where I can keep them stable until Datasette 2.0 - which with any luck won't ever need to happen.</p>
<p>I intend 1.0 as a promise that Datasette is a rock-solid foundation on which people can build build their own APIs, sites and plugins.</p>
<p>This also means I need to refactor some of the cruft. Work on the 1.0 API has been held up because it depends on some of the most complex code in the system, some of which has evolved in some pretty ugly ways over the past few years.</p>
<p>The two most covoluted aspects of Datasette's codebase dealt with the following:</p>
 
 Handling the difference between <code>/database/t1.json</code> where the table is called <code>t1</code> and <code>/database/t1.json</code> where the table is called <code>t1.json</code> (a valid SQLite table name) - and handling database tables with <code>/</code> as part of their name. I wrote more about that <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Mar/5/dash-encoding/">when I described dash encoding</a>. 
 
<a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/0.60.2/performance.html#hashed-url-mode">Hashed URL mode</a> - an optional performance optimization where Datasette rewrites the URLs to a database to incorporate part of the SHA-256 hash of the database contents, so it can use far-future cache expire headers. 
 
<p>This week, I solved both of these!</p>
 Tilde encoding, not dash encoding 
<p>In <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Mar/5/dash-encoding/">Why I invented “dash encoding”, a new encoding scheme for URL paths</a> I confidently described a new approach to encoding values in a URL, based on the unfortunate fact that it turns out URL encoding in the path of a URL can't be used reliably due to long-standing unfixable bugs in a large number of widely used reverse proxies.</p>
<p>My original dash encoding scheme worked like this:</p>
 
 
<code>/foo/bar</code> encoded to <code>-/foo-/bar</code>
 
 
<code>table.csv</code> encoded to <code>table-.csv</code>
 
 
<code>foo-bar</code> encoded to <code>foo--bar</code>
 
 
<p>Then I hit a huge problem with it: this encoding scheme does nothing special with the <code>%</code> character. But... it turns out the <code>%</code> character can't be relied on in a URL since there's a chance it may be mangled by one of the afore-mentioned misbehaving proxies.</p>
<p>Using <code>-%</code> doesn't help because that still has an unsafe percent character in it.</p>
<p>Then <a href="https://twitter.com/glyph/status/1500244937312329730">glyph suggested this</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you considered replacing % with some other character and then using percent-encoding?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I invented dash encoding v2, which worked exactly the same as URL percentage encoding but used the <code>-</code> character instead of the <code>%</code>.</p>
 
 
<code>/foo/bar</code> encodes to <code>-2Ffoo-2Fbar</code>
 
 
<code>-/db-/table.csv</code> encodes to <code>-2D-2Fdb-2D-2Ftable-2Ecsv</code>
 
 
<p>I was pretty confident this would work... until I started rolling out the new Datasette <code>main</code> branch to some of my deployed Datasette instances. That's when I realized that <code>-</code> is a VERY common character in existing installations, and escaping it was actually pretty ugly.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette website</a> uses a database called <code>dogsheep-index</code> - this got renamed to <code>dogsheep-2Findex</code>, which broke the search page.</p>
<p>More importantly, replacing <code>-</code> in a name with <code>-2F</code> is just really ugly. Surely I can do better than that?</p>
<p>I consulted <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-2.3">the URI RFC</a> and was delighted to find this list of unreserved characters:</p>
 <code>unreserved  = ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." / "_" / "~"
</code> 
<p>And so <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1657">Tilde encoding</a> was born! Same exact idea: percent encoding, but use a different character. In this case <code>~</code>.</p>
 
 
<code>dogsheep-beta</code> encodes to <code>dogsheep-beta</code>
 
 
<code>/foo/bar</code> encodes to <code>~2Ffoo~2Fbar</code>
 
 
<code>-/db-/table.csv</code> encodes to <code>-~2Fdb-~2Ftable~2Ecsv</code>
 
 
<p>This works great. It doesn't require encoding hyphens, so it results in prettier URLs. So it's now implemented on Datasette <code>main</code>, ready for the next release.</p>
 Removing Hashed URL mode 
<p>I wrote about this three years ago as <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2018/Oct/4/datasette-ideas/#Farfuture_cache_expiration">one of the interesting ideas in Datasette</a>. The key idea was inspired by CSS and JavaScript asset rewriting: if your database never changes, you can rewrite the JSON URLs to <code>/database-c9e67c4</code> and send far-future cache expiry headers with every response, caching them in both browsers and CDNs.</p>
<p>I liked the idea so much I made Datasette do it by default!</p>
<p>In <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2019/May/19/datasette-0-28/">Datasette 0.28 I changed my mind</a>. Datasette grew the option to serve  databases that could change while the server was running, at which point that optimization stopped making sense. I <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/418">made it an option</a>, controlled by a new <code>hash_urls</code> setting.</p>
<p>A couple of years later, I realized I hadn't chosen to use that option myself in any of my own projects. I'd also really started to grate at the additional complexity the feature brought to the codebase.</p>
<p>I set myself a task to reconsider it before 1.0. This week, I found what I think is the right solution: I extracted the functionality out into a separate plugin, <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-hashed-urls">datasette-hashed-urls</a>.</p>
<p>The key to building the plugin was realizing that, if the database is immutable, I can handle the URL rewriting simply by <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-hashed-urls/blob/0.2/datasette_hashed_urls/__init__.py#L6-L19">renaming the database to include its hash</a> when the server first starts up.</p>
<p>The rest of the plugin implementation then handles redirects, for if the database has changed its contents and the old hash URLs need to be redirected to the new one.</p>
<p>Having built the plugin, I <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/commit/d4f60c2388c01ddce1b16f95c16d310e037c9912">removed the implementation from core</a> in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1661">issue 1661</a>. This resulted in some sizable, satisfying code deletion, further convincing me that this was the right decision for the project.</p>
 Creeping closer to 1.0 
<p>If you want to follow the progress towards the first stable release,<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/milestone/7">the Datasette 1.0 milestone</a> is the place to look.</p>
<p>I'm determined to make significant progress this month, with the goal of shipping an alpha before March turns into April.</p>

<p>The article shows how to add extra identity claims to an ASP.NET Core application which authenticates using the Microsoft.Identity.Web client library and Azure AD B2C or Azure AD as the identity provider (IDP). This could easily be switched to OpenID Connect and use any IDP which supports OpenID Connect. The extra claims are added after an Azure Microsoft Graph HTTP request and it is important that this is only called once for a user session. </p>



<p>Code <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/azureb2c-fed-azuread">https://github.com/damienbod/azureb2c-fed-azuread</a></p>



<p>Normally I use the IClaimsTransformation interface to add extra claims to an ASP.NET Core session. This interface gets called multiple times and has no caching solution. If using this interface to add extra claims to your application, you must implement a cache solution for the extra claims and prevent extra API calls or database requests with every request. Instead of implementing a cache and using the IClaimsTransformation interface, alternatively you could just use the OnTokenValidated event with the OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme scheme. This gets called after a successfully authentication against your identity provider. If Microsoft.Identity.Web is used as the OIDC client which is specific for Azure AD and Azure B2C, you must add the configuration to the MicrosoftIdentityOptions otherwise downstream APIs will not work. If using OpenID Connect directly and a different IDP, then use the OpenIdConnectOptions  configuration. This can be added to the services of the ASP.NET Core application.</p>


  services.Configure&lt;MicrosoftIdentityOptions&gt;(
    OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme, options =&gt;
{
	options.Events.OnTokenValidated = async context =&gt;
	{
		if (ApplicationServices != null &amp;&amp; context.Principal != null)
		{
			using var scope = ApplicationServices.CreateScope();
			context.Principal = await scope.ServiceProvider
				.GetRequiredService&lt;MsGraphClaimsTransformation&gt;()
				.TransformAsync(context.Principal);
		}
	};
});
  


<p>Note</p>



<p>If using default OpenID Connect and not the Microsoft.Identity.Web client to authenticate, use the OpenIdConnectOptions and not the MicrosoftIdentityOptions.</p>



<p>Here’s an example of an OIDC setup.</p>


  builder.Services.Configure&lt;OpenIdConnectOptions&gt;(OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme, options =&gt;
{
    options.Events.OnTokenValidated = async context =&gt;
    {
        if(ApplicationServices != null &amp;&amp; context.Principal != null)
        {
            using var scope = ApplicationServices.CreateScope();
            context.Principal = await scope.ServiceProvider
                .GetRequiredService&lt;MyClaimsTransformation&gt;()
                .TransformAsync(context.Principal);
        }
    };
});
  


<p>The IServiceProvider ApplicationServices are used to add the scoped MsGraphClaimsTransformation service which is used to add the extra calls using Microsoft Graph. This needs to be added to the configuration in the startup or the program file.</p>


  protected IServiceProvider ApplicationServices { get; set; } = null;

public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
	ApplicationServices = app.ApplicationServices;

  


<p>The Microsoft Graph services are added to the IoC.</p>


  services.AddScoped&lt;MsGraphService&gt;();
services.AddScoped&lt;MsGraphClaimsTransformation&gt;();
  


<p>The MsGraphClaimsTransformation uses the Microsoft Graph client to get groups of a user, create a new ClaimsIdentity, add the extra claims to this group and add the ClaimsIdentity to the ClaimsPrincipal.</p>


  using AzureB2CUI.Services;
using System.Linq;
using System.Security.Claims;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace AzureB2CUI;

public class MsGraphClaimsTransformation
{
    private readonly MsGraphService _msGraphService;

    public MsGraphClaimsTransformation(MsGraphService msGraphService)
    {
        _msGraphService = msGraphService;
    }

    public async Task&lt;ClaimsPrincipal&gt; TransformAsync(ClaimsPrincipal principal)
    {
        ClaimsIdentity claimsIdentity = new();
        var groupClaimType = "group";
        if (!principal.HasClaim(claim =&gt; claim.Type == groupClaimType))
        {
            var objectidentifierClaimType = "http://schemas.microsoft.com/identity/claims/objectidentifier";
            var objectIdentifier = principal.Claims.FirstOrDefault(t =&gt; t.Type == objectidentifierClaimType);

            var groupIds = await _msGraphService.GetGraphApiUserMemberGroups(objectIdentifier.Value);

            foreach (var groupId in groupIds.ToList())
            {
                claimsIdentity.AddClaim(new Claim(groupClaimType, groupId));
            }
        }

        principal.AddIdentity(claimsIdentity);
        return principal;
    }
}
  


<p>The MsGraphService service implements the different HTTP requests to Microsoft Graph. Azure AD B2C is used in this example and so an application client is used to access the Azure AD with the ClientSecretCredential. The implementation is setup to use secrets from Azure Key Vault directly in any deployments, or from user secrets for development. </p>


  using Azure.Identity;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using Microsoft.Graph;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace AzureB2CUI.Services;

public class MsGraphService
{
    private readonly GraphServiceClient _graphServiceClient;

    public MsGraphService(IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        string[] scopes = configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("GraphApi:Scopes")?.Split(' ');
        var tenantId = configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("GraphApi:TenantId");

        // Values from app registration
        var clientId = configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("GraphApi:ClientId");
        var clientSecret = configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("GraphApi:ClientSecret");

        var options = new TokenCredentialOptions
        {
            AuthorityHost = AzureAuthorityHosts.AzurePublicCloud
        };

        // https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.identity.clientsecretcredential
        var clientSecretCredential = new ClientSecretCredential(
            tenantId, clientId, clientSecret, options);

        _graphServiceClient = new GraphServiceClient(clientSecretCredential, scopes);
    }

    public async Task&lt;User&gt; GetGraphApiUser(string userId)
    {
        return await _graphServiceClient.Users[userId]
                .Request()
                .GetAsync();
    }

    public async Task&lt;IUserAppRoleAssignmentsCollectionPage&gt; GetGraphApiUserAppRoles(string userId)
    {
        return await _graphServiceClient.Users[userId]
                .AppRoleAssignments
                .Request()
                .GetAsync();
    }

    public async Task&lt;IDirectoryObjectGetMemberGroupsCollectionPage&gt; GetGraphApiUserMemberGroups(string userId)
    {
        var securityEnabledOnly = true;

        return await _graphServiceClient.Users[userId]
            .GetMemberGroups(securityEnabledOnly)
            .Request().PostAsync();
    }
}
  


<p>When the application is run, the two ClaimsIdentity instances exist with every request and are available for using in the ASP.NET Core application.</p>







<p>Notes</p>



<p>This works really well but you should not add too many claims to the identity in this way. If you have many identity descriptions or a lot of user data, then you should use the IClaimsTransformation interface with a good cache solution.</p>

  <p>I just released <a href="https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper-template">shot-scraper-template</a>, a GitHub repository template that helps you start taking automated screenshots of a web page by filling out a form.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper">shot-scraper</a> is my command line tool for <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Mar/10/shot-scraper/">taking screenshots</a> of web pages and <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Mar/14/scraping-web-pages-shot-scraper/">scraping data from them</a> using JavaScript.</p>
<p>One of its uses is to help create and maintain screenshots for documentation, making it easy to update them to include changes to the design of the underlying pages.</p>
<p>To make this as easy as possible, I've created a GitHub repository template that automates the process of setting up <code>shot-scraper</code> to run against a URL.</p>
<p>To try it out, start here:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper-template/generate">https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper-template/generate</a></p>
<p></p>
<p>Pick a name for your new repository and paste the URL of the page you want to screenshot into the description field.</p>
<p>Then click "Create repository from template".</p>
<p>That's it! Your new repository will be created, a GitHub Actions automation script will run for a few seconds and your new screenshot will be added to the repository as a file called <code>shot.png</code>.</p>
<p>Here's an example repository I created using the template: <a href="https://github.com/simonw/simonwillison-net-shot">simonw/simonwillison-net-shot</a> - and here's the <code>shot.png</code> file from that repo:</p>
<p></p>
<p>You can re-take the screenshot any time you want by clicking the "Run workflow" button in the Actions tab:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Your repository will have a file in it called <code>shots.yml</code> that initially looks like this:</p>
  - url: https://simonwillison.net/
  output: shot.png
  height: 800  
<p>You can edit that file to change the settings that apply to your screenshot, or to add further URLs to take shots of like this:</p>
  - url: https://simonwillison.net/
  output: shot.png
  height: 800
- url: https://www.example.com/
  output: example.png
  height: 800  
<p>Further options are available here, as described in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper#taking-multiple-screenshots">the shot-scraper README</a>.</p>
 How this works 
<p>This entire system is based around a single GitHub Actions workflow, in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper-template/blob/main/.github/workflows/shots.yml">.github/workflows/shots.yml</a>.</p>
<p>Here's an annotated copy of that workflow showing how it all works.</p>
  name: Take screnshots

on:
  push:
  workflow_dispatch:  
<p>The workflow triggers when a change is made to the repository (including edits to the <code>shots.yml</code> file) or when the user manually clicks "Run workflow".</p>
  jobs:
  shot-scraper:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: ${{ github.repository != 'simonw/shot-scraper-template' }}  
<p>This is the trick that makes everything else work, which I picked up <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Aug/28/dynamic-github-repository-templates/">from Bruno Rocha last year</a>. It ensures that this workflow job only runs on copies of the template, not on the initial template repository itself.</p>
<p>This is necessary because a later step creates a file in the repository if it doesn't yet exist based on the description URL provided by the user.</p>
      steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python 3.10
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: "3.10"
    - uses: actions/cache@v2
      name: Configure pip caching
      with:
        path: ~/.cache/pip
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-pip-${{ hashFiles('requirements.txt') }}
        restore-keys: |
          ${{ runner.os }}-pip-  
<p>This is boilerplate that I use in most of my GitHub Actions workflows: it sets up Python 3.10, and also <a href="https://github.com/actions/cache">configures a cache</a> such that Python requirements in a <code>requirements.txt</code> file persist from one invocation to another without having to be re-downloaded from PyPI.</p>
      - name: Cache Playwright browsers
      uses: actions/cache@v2
      with:
        path: ~/.cache/ms-playwright/
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-browsers  
<p><code>shot-scraper</code> uses Microsoft's open source <a href="https://playwright.dev/">Playwright</a> browser automation tool. Playwright works by installing its own full Chromium browser. This line configures a cache for that browser, such that future invocations of the Action don't need to download another copy.</p>
      - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    - name: Install Playwright dependencies
      run: |
        shot-scraper install  
<p>The <code>pip install</code> line here installs the <code>shot-scraper</code> CLI tool, which is written in Python.</p>
<p>That <code>shot-scraper install</code> line then triggers the Playwright mechanism to download and install the browser. This will do nothing if the browser has already been cached.</p>
      - uses: actions/github-script@v6
      name: Create shots.yml if missing on first run
      with:
        script: |
          const fs = require('fs');
          if (!fs.existsSync('shots.yml')) {
              const desc = context.payload.repository.description;
              let line = '';
              if (desc &amp;&amp; (desc.startsWith('http://') || desc.startsWith('https://'))) {
                  line = `- url: ${desc}` + '\n  output: shot.png\n  height: 800';
              } else {
                  line = '# - url: https://www.example.com/\n#   output: shot.png\n#   height: 800';
              }
              fs.writeFileSync('shots.yml', line + '\n');
          }  
<p>This is the other key piece of magic. This uses GitHub's <a href="https://github.com/actions/github-script">github-script</a> action, which provides a Node.js environment with a <code>context</code> object containing details about the actions run.</p>
<p>It starts by reading the repository description from <code>context.payload.repository.description</code>.</p>
<p>Then it creates a <code>shots.yml</code> file based on that description - but only if the file does not exist already.</p>
<p>If there's no repository description it creates one with a commented-out configuration instead, that looks like this:</p>
  # - url: https://www.example.com/
#   output: shot.png
#   height: 800  
<p>The next step is to take the screenshots:</p>
      - name: Take shots
      run: |
        shot-scraper multi shots.yml  
<p><code>shot-scraper multi</code> is <a href="https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper#taking-multiple-screenshots">documented here</a> - it runs through the YAML file and takes each of the screenshots configured there in turn.</p>
<p>Final step is to commit and push the new <code>shots.yml</code> and <code>shot.png</code> files to the repository:</p>
      - name: Commit and push
      run: |-
        git config user.name "Automated"
        git config user.email "actions@users.noreply.github.com"
        git add -A
        timestamp=$(date -u)
        git commit -m "${timestamp}" || exit 0
        git pull --rebase
        git push  
<p>This uses a pattern I describe <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/github-actions/commit-if-file-changed">in this TIL</a>.</p>
 GitHub Actions as a platform 
<p>I <a href="https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1502838806113763329">tweeted this</a> the other day, shortly before I came up with the idea for the <code>shot-scraper-template</code> repository.</p>
<blockquote><p>Genuinely think GitHub Actions might be my favourite serverless platform right now</p>- Simon Willison (@simonw) <a href="https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1502838806113763329?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 13, 2022</a></blockquote>
<p>This project demonstrates why. The amount of complex moving parts involved in <code>shot-scraper-template</code> is pretty bewildering, but the end result is a free tool that anyone can use to start taking automated screenshots.</p>
<p>And it doesn't cost me anything to provide the tool either!</p>

  <p>Summary:      Provisional authenticity and confidentiality can help us manage the trade offs between privacy and authenticity to support online accountability along with functional privacy.</p>



<p>
    Last week, I <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2022/03/privacy_authenticity_and_confidentiality.shtml">discussed the trade offs between privacy, authenticity, and confidentiality</a>, concluding that the real trade off is usually between privacy and authenticity. That might seem like it pits privacy against accountability and leaves us with a Hobson's choice where good privacy is impossible if we want to prevent fraud. Fortunately, the trade off is informed by a number of factors, making the outcome not nearly as bleak as it might appear at first.
</p>

<p>
    Authenticity is often driven by a need for accountability1. Understanding accountability helps navigate the spectrum of choices between privacy and authenticity. As I mentioned last week, Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations require that banks be able to identify the parties to transactions. That's why, when you open a bank account, they ask for numerous identity documents. The purpose is to enable law enforcement to determine the actors behind transactions deemed illegal (hopefully with a warrant). Technically, this is a bias toward authenticity at the cost of privacy. But there are nuances. The bank collects this data but doesn't need to use it unless there's a question of fraud or money laundering2. 
</p>

<p>
    The point is that while in a technical sense, the non-repudiability of bank transactions makes them less private, there aren't a lot of people who are concerned about the privacy of their banking transactions. The authenticity associated with those transactions is provisional or latent3. Transactions are only revealed to outside parties when legally required and most people don't worry about that. From that perspective, transactions with provisional authenticity are private enough. We might call this functional privacy.
</p>

<p>
    I've used movie tickets several times as an example of an ephemeral transaction that doesn't need authenticity to function and thus is private. But consider another example where an ephemeral, non-authenticated transaction is not good enough. A while back our family went to the ice-skating rink. We bought a ticket to get in, just like at the movies. But each of us also signed a liability waiver. That waiver, which the skating rink required to reduce their risk, meant that the transaction was much less private. Unlike the bank, where I feel confident my KYC data is not being shared, I don't know what the skating rink is doing with the data. 
</p>

<p>
    This is a situation where minimal disclosure doesn't help me. I've given away the data needed to hold me accountable in the case of an accident. No promise was made to me about what the rink might do with it.  The only way to hold me accountable and protect my privacy is for the authenticity of the transaction to be made provisional through agreement. If the skating rink were to make strong promises that the data would only be used in the event that I had an accident and threatened to sue, then even though I'm identified to the rink, my privacy is protected except in clearly defined circumstances. 
</p>

<p>
    Online we can make the authenticity's provisionality even more trustworthy using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commitment_scheme">cryptographic commitments</a> and key escrow. The idea is that any data about me that's needed to enforce the waiver would be hidden from the rink, unchangeable by me, and only revealed if I threaten to sue. This adds a technical element and allows me to exchange my need to trust the rink with trusting the escrow agent. Trusting the escrow agent might be more manageable than trusting every business I interact with. Escrow services could be regulated as fiduciaries to increase trust.
</p>

<p>
    Provisional authenticity works when the data is only needed in a low-probability events. Often, however, data is actively used to provide <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml#utility">utility in the relationship</a>. In these cases, confidentiality agreements, essentially NDAs, are the answer to providing functional privacy and also providing the authenticity needed for accountability and utility. These agreements can't be the traditional <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/adhesion_contract_(contract_of_adhesion)">contracts of adhesion</a> where, rather than promising to protect confidentiality, companies force people to consent to surveillance. Agreements should be written to ensure that data is always shared with the same promise of confidentiality that existed in the root agreement.
</p>

<p>
    Provisional authenticity and data NDAs provide good tools for protecting functional privacy without giving up accountability and relationship utility. Functional privacy and accountability are both necessary for creating digital systems that respect and protect people. 
</p>


 

<a></a>
 Notes 
 
     Beyond accountability, a number of businesses make their living surveilling people online or are remunerated for aiding in the collection of data that informs that surveillance. I've <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/05/can_the_digital_future_be_our_home.shtml">written about surveillance economy</a> and ideas for dealing with it previously. 
     Note that I said need. I'm aware that banks likely use it for more than this, often without disclosing how it's being used. 
     I'm grateful to <a href="https://prosapien.com/about/">Sam Smith</a> for discussions that helped me clarify my thinking about this.

  <p>I've added a powerful new capability to my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper">shot-scraper</a> command line browser automation tool: you can now use it to load a web page in a headless browser, execute JavaScript to extract information and return that information back to the terminal as JSON.</p>
<p>Among other things, this means you can construct Unix pipelines that incorporate a full headless web browser as part of their processing.</p>
<p>It's also a really neat web scraping tool.</p>
 shot-scraper 
<p>I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Mar/10/shot-scraper/">introduced shot-scraper</a> last Thursday. It's a Python utility that wraps <a href="https://playwright.dev/">Playwright</a>, providing both a command line interface and a YAML-driven configuration flow for automating the process of taking screenshots of web pages.</p>
 <code>% pip install shot-scraper
% shot-scraper https://simonwillison.net/ --height 800
Screenshot of 'https://simonwillison.net/' written to 'simonwillison-net.png'
</code> 
<p></p>
<p>Since Thursday <code>shot-scraper</code> has had <a href="https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper/releases">a flurry of releases</a>, adding features like <a href="https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper/blob/0.9/README.md#saving-a-web-page-to-pdf">PDF exports</a>, the ability to dump the Chromium <a href="https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper/blob/0.9/README.md#dumping-out-an-accessibility-tree">accessibilty tree</a> and the ability to take screenshots of <a href="https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper/blob/0.9/README.md#websites-that-need-authentication">authenticated web pages</a>. But the most exciting new feature landed today.</p>
 Executing JavaScript and returning the result 
<p><a href="https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper/releases/tag/0.9">Release 0.9</a> takes the tool in a new direction. The following command will execute JavaScript on the page and return the resulting value:</p>
 <code>% shot-scraper javascript simonwillison.net document.title
"Simon Willison\u2019s Weblog"
</code> 
<p>Or you can return a JSON object:</p>
 <code>% shot-scraper javascript https://datasette.io/ "({
  title: document.title,
  tagline: document.querySelector('.tagline').innerText
})"
{
  "title": "Datasette: An open source multi-tool for exploring and publishing data",
  "tagline": "An open source multi-tool for exploring and publishing data"
}
</code> 
<p>Or if you want to use functions like <code>setTimeout()</code> - for example, if you want to insert a delay to allow an animation to finish before running the rest of your code - you can return a promise:</p>
 <code>% shot-scraper javascript datasette.io "
new Promise(done =&gt; setInterval(
  () =&gt; {
    done({
      title: document.title,
      tagline: document.querySelector('.tagline').innerText
    });
  }, 1000
));"
</code> 
<p>Errors that occur in the JavaScript turn into an exit code of 1 returned by the tool - which means you can also use this to execute simple tests in a CI flow. This example will fail a GitHub Actions workflow if the extracted page title is not the expected value:</p>
  - name: Test page title
  run: |-
    shot-scraper javascript datasette.io "
      if (document.title != 'Datasette') {
        throw 'Wrong title detected';
      }"  
 Using this to scrape a web page 
<p>The most exciting use case for this new feature is web scraping. I'll illustrate that with an example.</p>
<p>Posts from my blog occasionally show up on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> - sometimes I spot them, sometimes I don't.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/from?site=simonwillison.net">https://news.ycombinator.com/from?site=simonwillison.net</a> is a Hacker News page showing content from the specified domain. It's really useful, but it sadly isn't included in the official <a href="https://github.com/HackerNews/API">Hacker News API</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So... let's write a scraper for it.</p>
<p>I started out running the Firefox developer console against that page, trying to figure out the right JavaScript to extract the data I was interested in. I came up with this:</p>

  Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.itemlist .athing')).map(el =&gt; {
  const title = el.querySelector('a.titlelink').innerText;
  const points = parseInt(el.nextSibling.querySelector('.score').innerText);
  const url = el.querySelector('a.titlelink').href;
  const dt = el.nextSibling.querySelector('.age').title;
  const submitter = el.nextSibling.querySelector('.hnuser').innerText;
  const commentsUrl = el.nextSibling.querySelector('.subtext a:last-child').href;
  const id = commentsUrl.split('?id=')[1];
  const numComments = parseInt(
    Array.from(
      el.nextSibling.querySelectorAll('.subtext a[href^=item]')
    ).slice(-1)[0].innerText.split()[0]
  ) || 0;
  return {id, title, url, dt, points, submitter, commentsUrl, numComments};
})  

<p>The great thing about modern JavaScript is that everything you could need to write a scraper is already there in the default environment.</p>
<p>I'm using <code>document.querySelectorAll('.itemlist .athing')</code> to loop through each element that matches that selector.</p>
<p>I wrap that with <code>Array.from(...)</code> so I can use the <code>.map()</code> method. Then for each element I can extract out the details that I need.</p>
<p>The resulting array contains 30 items that look like this:</p>
  [
  {
    "id": "30658310",
    "title": "Track changes to CLI tools by recording their help output",
    "url": "https://simonwillison.net/2022/Feb/2/help-scraping/",

 Running it with shot-scraper 
<p>Now that I have a recipe for a scraper, I can run it in the terminal like this:</p>
 <code>shot-scraper javascript \
  "https://news.ycombinator.com/from?site=simonwillison.net" "
Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.itemlist .athing')).map(el =&gt; {
  const title = el.querySelector('a.titlelink').innerText;
  const points = parseInt(el.nextSibling.querySelector('.score').innerText);
  const url = el.querySelector('a.titlelink').href;
  const dt = el.nextSibling.querySelector('.age').title;
  const submitter = el.nextSibling.querySelector('.hnuser').innerText;
  const commentsUrl = el.nextSibling.querySelector('.subtext a:last-child').href;
  const id = commentsUrl.split('?id=')[1];
  const numComments = parseInt(
    Array.from(
      el.nextSibling.querySelectorAll('.subtext a[href^=item]')
    ).slice(-1)[0].innerText.split()[0]
  ) || 0;
  return {id, title, url, dt, points, submitter, commentsUrl, numComments};
})
" &gt; simonwillison-net.json
</code> 
<p><code>simonwillison-net.json</code> is now a JSON file containing the scraped data.</p>
 Running the scraper in GitHub Actions 
<p>I want to keep track of changes to this data structure over time. My preferred technique for that is something I call <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/">Git scraping</a> - the core idea is to keep the data in a Git repository and commit an update any time it updates. This provides a cheap and robust history of changes over time.</p>
<p>Running the scraper in GitHub Actions means I don't need to administrate my own server to keep this running.</p>
<p>So I built exactly that, in the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/scrape-hacker-news-by-domain">simonw/scrape-hacker-news-by-domain</a> repository.</p>
<p>The GitHub Actions workflow is in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/scrape-hacker-news-by-domain/blob/485841482a39869759e39f4d8dee21b9adc963d7/.github/workflows/scrape.yml">.github/workflows/scrape.yml</a>. It runs the above command once an hour, then pushes a commit back to the repository should the file have any changes since last time it ran.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/simonw/scrape-hacker-news-by-domain/commits/main/simonwillison-net.json">commit history of simonwillison-net.json</a> will show me any time a new link from my site appears on Hacker News, or a comment is added.</p>
<p>(Fun GitHub trick: add <code>.atom</code> to the end of that URL to get <a href="https://github.com/simonw/scrape-hacker-news-by-domain/commits/main/simonwillison-net.json.atom">an Atom feed of those commits</a>.)</p>
<p>The whole scraper, from idea to finished implementation, took less than fifteen minutes to build and deploy.</p>
<p>I can see myself using this technique a lot in the future.</p>

  <p>My goal for this week was to unblock progress on Datasette by finally finishing the dash encoding implementation I described last week. I was getting close, and then I got very distracted by <a>Playwright</a>.</p>
 Dash encoding v2 
<p>In <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Mar/5/dash-encoding/">Why I invented “dash encoding”, a new encoding scheme for URL paths</a> I described a new mechanism I had invented for handling the gnarly problem of including table names with <code>/</code> characters in the URL path on Datasette. The very short version: you can't use URL encoding in a path, because common proxies (including Apache and Nginx) will decode them before they get to your application.</p>
<p>Thanks to feedback on that post I actually changed my design: I'm now using a variant of percent encoding that uses the <code>-</code> instead of the <code>%</code>. More <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1439#issuecomment-1059851259">details in the issue</a> - and I'll write this up fully once I've finished landing the change.</p>
 shot-scraper and Playwright 
<p>I thoroughly <a href="https://xkcd.com/356/">nerd-sniped</a> myself with this one. I started investigating possibilities for automatically generating screeshots for documentation, and realized that <a href="https://playwright.dev/">Playwright</a> made this substantially easier than it has been in the past.</p>
<p>The result was <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Mar/10/shot-scraper/">shot-scraper</a> - a new command-line utility for taking screenshots of web pages, or portions of web pages - and for running through a set of screenshots defined in a YAML file.</p>
<p>I still can't quite believe how quickly this came together.</p>
<p>Every now and then a tool comes along which adds a fundamental new set of capabilities to your toolbox, and can be multiplied against other tools to open up a huge range of possibilities.</p>
<p>Playwright feels like one of those tools.</p>
<p>A quick <code>pip install playwright</code> is all it takes to start writing robust browser automation tools, using dedicated standalone headless instances of multiple browsers that are installed for you using <code>playwright install</code>.</p>
<p>It's easy to run in CI - getting it working in GitHub Actions was trivial.</p>
<p><code>shot-scraper</code> is my first project built on Playwright, but there will definitely be more.</p>
 shot-scraper accessibility 
<p>I started <a href="https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1502044953836503048">a Twitter conversation</a> asking for ways to write automated tests that exercise screen readers - not just running audit rules, but actually simulating what happens when a screen reader user attempts to navigate through a specific flow within an application.</p>
<p>The most interesting answer I had was <a href="https://twitter.com/bmustillrose/status/1502066504401141767">from Ben Mustill-Rose</a>, who built a system for automating tests against an Android screen reader while working on BBC iPlayer - <a href="https://youtu.be/-vEHOiIggss?t=253">demo here</a>.</p>
<p>@fardarter <a href="https://twitter.com/fardarter/status/1502045993667280905">pointed me</a> back to Playwright again, which turns out to have an <a href="https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-accessibility">Accessibility snapshot</a> mechanism that can dump out the current state of the Chromium accessibility tree.</p>
<p>I couldn't resist <a href="https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper/issues/22">adding that to shot-scraper</a> - so now you can run the following to see the accessibility tree for a web page:</p>
 <code>~ % shot-scraper accessibility https://datasette.io
{
    "role": "WebArea",
    "name": "Datasette: An open source multi-tool for exploring and publishing data",
    "children": [
        {
            "role": "link",
            "name": "Uses"
        },
        {
            "role": "link",
            "name": "Documentation"
        },
</code> 
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/431e9075441463236850bab042b9d20d">Full output here</a>.</p>
<p>As a really fun bonus trick: since the output is JSON, you can pipe it into <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/cli.html#inserting-json-data">sqlite-utils insert</a> to get a SQLite database:</p>
 <code>shot-scraper accessibility https://datasette.io \
    | jq .children | sqlite-utils insert \
    /tmp/accessibility.db nodes - --alter
</code> 
<p>And then open it in <a href="https://datasette.io/desktop">Datasette Desktop</a> and start faceting by role and heading level!</p>
<p></p>
 sqlite-utils documentation improvements 
<p>I complained on Twitter that the way type information was displayed in the Sphinx <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/reference.html">sqlite-utils API reference documentation</a> was ugly:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Adam Johnson <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamChainz/status/1502311047612575745">pointed me</a> to the <code>autodoc_typehints = "description"</code> option which fixes this. I spent a while tidying up the documentation to work better with this, mainly by adding a whole bunch of <code>:param name: description</code> tags that I had previously omitted. That work happenen in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils/issues/413">this issue</a>. I think it looks much better now:</p>

<p>This article shows how to create different types of Azure B2C users using Microsoft Graph and ASP.NET Core. The users are created using application permissions in an Azure App registration.</p>



<p>Code <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/azureb2c-fed-azuread">https://github.com/damienbod/azureb2c-fed-azuread</a></p>



<p>The Microsoft.Identity.Web Nuget package is used to authenticate the administrator user that can create new Azure B2C users. An ASP.NET Core Razor page application is used to implement the Azure B2C user management and also to hold the sensitive data. </p>


  public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
	services.AddScoped&lt;MsGraphService&gt;();
	services.AddTransient&lt;IClaimsTransformation, MsGraphClaimsTransformation&gt;();
	services.AddHttpClient();

	services.AddOptions();

	services.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebAppAuthentication(Configuration, "AzureAdB2C")
		.EnableTokenAcquisitionToCallDownstreamApi()
		.AddInMemoryTokenCaches();
  


<p>The AzureAdB2C app settings configures the B2C client. An Azure B2C user flow is implemented for authentication. In this example, a signin or signup flow is implemented, although if creating your own user, maybe only a signin is required. The GraphApi configuration is used for the Microsoft Graph application client with uses the client credentials flow. A user secret was created to access the Azure App registration. This secret is stored in the user secrets for development and stored in Azure Key Vault for any deployments. You could use certificates as well but this offers no extra security unless using directly from a client host. </p>


    "AzureAdB2C": {
    "Instance": "https://b2cdamienbod.b2clogin.com",
    "ClientId": "8cbb1bd3-c190-42d7-b44e-42b20499a8a1",
    "Domain": "b2cdamienbod.onmicrosoft.com",
    "SignUpSignInPolicyId": "B2C_1_signup_signin",
    "TenantId": "f611d805-cf72-446f-9a7f-68f2746e4724",
    "CallbackPath": "/signin-oidc",
    "SignedOutCallbackPath ": "/signout-callback-oidc"
  },
  "GraphApi": {
    "TenantId": "f611d805-cf72-446f-9a7f-68f2746e4724",
    "ClientId": "1d171c13-236d-4c2b-ac10-0325be2cbc74",
    "Scopes": ".default"
    //"ClientSecret": "--in-user-settings--"
  },
  "AadIssuerDomain": "damienbodhotmail.onmicrosoft.com",
  


<p>The application User.ReadWrite.All permission is used to create the users. See the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/user-post-users?view=graph-rest-1.0&amp;tabs=http#permissions">permissions</a> in the Microsoft Graph docs.</p>







<p>The MsGraphService service implements the Microsoft Graph client to create Azure tenant users. Application permissions are used because we use Azure B2C. If authenticating using Azure AD, you could use delegated permissions. The ClientSecretCredential is used to get the Graph access token and client with the required permissions.</p>


  public MsGraphService(IConfiguration configuration)
{
	string[] scopes = configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("GraphApi:Scopes")?.Split(' ');
	var tenantId = configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("GraphApi:TenantId");

	// Values from app registration
	var clientId = configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("GraphApi:ClientId");
	var clientSecret = configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("GraphApi:ClientSecret");

	_aadIssuerDomain = configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("AadIssuerDomain");
	_aadB2CIssuerDomain = configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("AzureAdB2C:Domain");

	var options = new TokenCredentialOptions
	{
		AuthorityHost = AzureAuthorityHosts.AzurePublicCloud
	};

	// https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.identity.clientsecretcredential
	var clientSecretCredential = new ClientSecretCredential(
		tenantId, clientId, clientSecret, options);

	_graphServiceClient = new GraphServiceClient(clientSecretCredential, scopes);
}
  


<p>The CreateAzureB2CSameDomainUserAsync method creates a same domain Azure B2C user and also creates an initial password which needs to be updated after a first signin. The users UserPrincipalName email must match the Azure B2C domain and the users can only signin with the the password. MFA should be setup. This works really good but it is not a good idea to handle passwords from your users, if this can be avoided. You need to share this with the user in a secure way.</p>


  public async Task&lt;(string Upn, string Password, string Id)&gt; 
	CreateAzureB2CSameDomainUserAsync(UserModelB2CTenant userModel)
{
	if(!userModel.UserPrincipalName.ToLower().EndsWith(_aadB2CIssuerDomain.ToLower()))
	{
		throw new ArgumentException("incorrect Email domain");
	}
		
	var password = GetEncodedRandomString();
	var user = new User
	{
		AccountEnabled = true,
		UserPrincipalName = userModel.UserPrincipalName,
		DisplayName = userModel.DisplayName,
		Surname = userModel.Surname,
		GivenName = userModel.GivenName,
		PreferredLanguage = userModel.PreferredLanguage,
		MailNickname = userModel.DisplayName,
		PasswordProfile = new PasswordProfile
		{
			ForceChangePasswordNextSignIn = true,
			Password = password
		}
	};

	await _graphServiceClient.Users
		.Request()
		.AddAsync(user);

	return (user.UserPrincipalName, user.PasswordProfile.Password, user.Id);
}
  


<p>The CreateFederatedUserWithPasswordAsync method creates an Azure B2C with any email address. This uses the SignInType federated, but uses a password and the user signs in directly to the Azure B2C. This password is not updated after a first signin. Again this is a bad idea because you need share the password with the user somehow and you as an admin should not know the user password. I would avoid creating users in this way and use a custom invitation flow, if you need this type of Azure B2C user. </p>


  public async Task&lt;(string Upn, string Password, string Id)&gt; 
	CreateFederatedUserWithPasswordAsync(UserModelB2CIdentity userModel)
{
	// new user create, email does not matter unless you require to send mails
	var password = GetEncodedRandomString();
	var user = new User
	{
		DisplayName = userModel.DisplayName,
		PreferredLanguage = userModel.PreferredLanguage,
		Surname = userModel.Surname,
		GivenName = userModel.GivenName,
		OtherMails = new List&lt;string&gt; { userModel.Email },
		Identities = new List&lt;ObjectIdentity&gt;()
		{
			new ObjectIdentity
			{
				SignInType = "federated",
				Issuer = _aadB2CIssuerDomain,
				IssuerAssignedId = userModel.Email
			},
		},
		PasswordProfile = new PasswordProfile
		{
			Password = password,
			ForceChangePasswordNextSignIn = false
		},
		PasswordPolicies = "DisablePasswordExpiration"
	};

	var createdUser = await _graphServiceClient.Users
		.Request()
		.AddAsync(user);

	return (createdUser.UserPrincipalName, user.PasswordProfile.Password, createdUser.Id);
}
  


<p>The CreateFederatedNoPasswordAsync method creates an Azure B2C federated user from a specific Azure AD domain which already exists and no password. The user can only signin using a federated signin to this tenant. No passwords are shared. This is really good way to onboard existing AAD users to an Azure B2C tenant. One disadvantage with this is that the email is not verified unlike implementing this using an invitation flow directly in the Azure AD tenant.</p>


  public async Task&lt;string&gt; 
	CreateFederatedNoPasswordAsync(UserModelB2CIdentity userModel)
{
	// User must already exist in AAD
	var user = new User
	{
		DisplayName = userModel.DisplayName,
		PreferredLanguage = userModel.PreferredLanguage,
		Surname = userModel.Surname,
		GivenName = userModel.GivenName,
		OtherMails = new List&lt;string&gt; { userModel.Email },
		Identities = new List&lt;ObjectIdentity&gt;()
		{
			new ObjectIdentity
			{
				SignInType = "federated",
				Issuer = _aadIssuerDomain,
				IssuerAssignedId = userModel.Email
			},
		}
	};

	var createdUser = await _graphServiceClient.Users
		.Request()
		.AddAsync(user);

	return createdUser.UserPrincipalName;
}
  


<p>When the application is started, you can signin as an IT admin and create new users as required. The Birthday can only be added if you have an SPO license. If the user exists in the AAD tenant, the user can signin using the federated identity provider. This could be improved by adding a search of the users in the target tenant and only allowing existing users. </p>







<p>Notes:</p>



<p>It is really easy to create users using Microsoft Graph but this is not always the best way, or a secure way of onboarding new users in an Azure B2C tenant. If local data is required, this can be really useful. Sharing passwords between an IT admin and a new user should be avoided if possible. The Microsoft Graph invite APIs do not work for Azure AD B2C, only Azure AD.</p>

   shot-scaper is a new tool that I’ve built to help automate the process of keeping screenshots up-to-date in my documentation. It also doubles as a scraping tool - hence the name - which I picked as a complement to my git scraping and help scraping techniques. 
 Update 13th March 2022: The new shot-scraper javascript command can now be used to scrape web pages from the command line.

  <p><a href="https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper">shot-scaper</a> is a new tool that I’ve built to help automate the process of keeping screenshots up-to-date in my documentation. It also doubles as a scraping tool - hence the name - which I picked as a complement to my <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/">git scraping</a> and <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Feb/2/help-scraping/">help scraping</a> techniques.</p>
<p>Update 13th March 2022: The new <code>shot-scraper javascript</code> command can now be used to <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Mar/14/scraping-web-pages-shot-scraper/">scrape web pages from the command line</a>.</p>
 The problem 
<p>I like to include screenshots in documentation. I recently <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Feb/27/datasette-tutorials/">started writing end-user tutorials</a> for Datasette, which are particularly image heavy (<a href="https://datasette.io/tutorials/explore">for example</a>).</p>
<p>As software changes over time, screenshots get out-of-date. I don't like the idea of stale screenshots, but I also don't want to have to manually recreate them every time I make the tiniest tweak to the visual appearance of my software.</p>
 Introducing shot-scraper 
<p><code>shot-scraper</code> is a tool for automating this process. You can install it using <code>pip</code> like this:</p>
 <code>pip install shot-scraper
shot-scraper install
</code> 
<p>That second <code>shot-scraper install</code> line will install the browser it needs to do its job - more on that later.</p>
<p>You can use it in two ways. To take a one-off screenshot, you can run it like this:</p>
 <code>shot-scraper https://simonwillison.net/ -o simonwillison.png
</code> 
<p>Or if you want to take a set of screenshots in a repeatable way, you can define them in a YAML file that looks like this:</p>
  - url: https://simonwillison.net/
  output: simonwillison.png
- url: https://www.example.com/
  width: 400
  height: 400
  quality: 80
  output: example.jpg  
<p>And then use <code>shot-scraper multi</code> to execute every screenshot in one go:</p>
 <code>% shot-scraper multi shots.yml 
Screenshot of 'https://simonwillison.net/' written to 'simonwillison.png'
Screenshot of 'https://www.example.com/' written to 'example.jpg'
</code> 
<p><a href="https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper/blob/main/README.md">The README</a> describes all of the available options you can use when taking a screenshot.</p>
<p>Each option can be provided to the <code>shot-scraper</code> one-off tool, or can be embedded in the YAML file for use with <code>shot-scraper multi</code>.</p>
 JavaScript and CSS selectors 
<p>The default behaviour for <code>shot-scraper</code> is to take a full page screenshot, using a browser width of 1280px.</p>
<p>For documentation screenshots you probably don't want the whole page though - you likely want to create an image of one specific part of the interface.</p>
<p>The <code>--selector</code> option allows you to specify an area of the page by CSS selector. The resulting image will consist just of that part of the page.</p>
<p>What if you want to modify the page in addition to selecting a specific area?</p>
<p>The <code>--javascript</code> option lets you pass in a block of JavaScript code which will be injected into the page and executed after the page has loaded, but before the screenshot is taken.</p>
<p>The combination of these two options - also available as <code>javascript:</code> and <code>selector:</code> keys in the YAML file - should be flexible enough to cover the custom screenshot case for documentation.</p>
 A complex example 
<p>To prove to myself that the tool works, I decided to try replicating this screenshot from <a href="https://datasette.io/tutorials/explore">my tutorial</a>.</p>
<p>I made the original using <a href="https://cleanshot.com/">CleanShot X</a>, manually adding the two pink arrows:</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is pretty tricky!</p>
 
 It's not <a href="https://congress-legislators.datasettes.com/legislators/executive_terms?start__startswith=18&amp;type=prez">this whole page</a>, just a subset of the page 
 The cog menu for one of the columns is open, which means the cog icon needs to be clicked before taking the screenshot 
 There are two pink arrows superimposed on the image 
 
<p>I decided to do use just one arrow for the moment, which should hopefully result in a clearer image.</p>
<p>I started by <a href="https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper/issues/9#issuecomment-1063314278">creating my own pink arrow SVG</a> using Figma:</p>
<p></p>
<p>I then fiddled around in the Firefox developer console for quite a while, working out the JavaScript needed to trim the page down to the bit I wanted, open the menu and position the arrow.</p>
<p>With the JavaScript figured out, I pasted it into a YAML file called <code>shot.yml</code>:</p>
  - url: https://congress-legislators.datasettes.com/legislators/executive_terms?start__startswith=18&amp;type=prez
  javascript: |
    new Promise(resolve =&gt; {
      // Run in a promise so we can sleep 1s at the end
      function remove(el) { el.parentNode.removeChild(el);}
      // Remove header and footer
      remove(document.querySelector('header'));
      remove(document.querySelector('footer'));
      // Remove most of the children of .content
      Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.content &gt; *:not(.table-wrapper,.suggested-facets)')).map(remove)
      // Bit of breathing room for the screenshot
      document.body.style.marginTop = '10px';
      // Add a bit of padding to .content
      var content = document.querySelector('.content');
      content.style.width = '820px';
      content.style.padding = '10px';
      // Open the menu - it's an SVG so we need to use dispatchEvent here
      document.querySelector('th.col-executive_id svg').dispatchEvent(new Event('click'));
      // Remove all but table header and first 11 rows
      Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('tr')).slice(12).map(remove);
      // Add a pink SVG arrow
      let div = document.createElement('div');
      div.innerHTML = `&lt;svg width="104" height="60" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;

          &lt;/filter&gt;
        &lt;/defs&gt;

      let svg = div.firstChild;
      content.appendChild(svg);
      content.style.position = 'relative';

      // Give the menu time to finish fading in

        // Position arrow pointing to the 'facet by this' menu item
        var pos = document.querySelector('.dropdown-facet').getBoundingClientRect();
        svg.style.left = (pos.left - pos.width) + 'px';
        svg.style.top = (pos.top - 20) + 'px';
        resolve();
      }, 1000);
    });
  output: annotated-screenshot.png
  selector: .content  
<p>And ran this command to generate the screenshot:</p>
 <code>shot-scraper multi shot.yml
</code> 
<p>The generated <code>annotated-screenshot.png</code> image looks like this:</p>
<p></p>
<p>I'm pretty happy with this! I think it works very well as a proof of concept for the process.</p>
 How it works: Playwright 
<p>I built the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper/tree/44995cd45ca6c56d34c5c3d131217f7b9170f6f7">first prototype</a> of <code>shot-scraper</code> using Puppeteer, because I had <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Sep/3/weeknotes-airtable-screenshots-dogsheep/">used that before</a>.</p>
<p>Then I noticed that the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer-cli">puppeteer-cli</a> package I was using hadn't had an update in two years, which reminded me to check out Playwright.</p>
<p>I've been looking for an excuse to learn <a href="https://playwright.dev/">Playwright</a> for a while now, and this project turned out to be ideal.</p>
<p>Playwright is Microsoft's open source browser automation framework. They promote it as a testing tool, but it has plenty of applications outside of testing - screenshot automation and screen scraping being two of the most obvious.</p>
<p>Playwright is comprehensive: it downloads its own custom browser builds, and can run tests across multiple different rendering engines.</p>
<p>The second prototype used the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper/tree/b3318b2f27ca1526d5a9f06de50cf9900dd4d8d0">Playwright CLI utility</a> instead, <a href="https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper/blob/b3318b2f27ca1526d5a9f06de50cf9900dd4d8d0/shot_scraper/cli.py#L39-L50">executed via npx</a>:</p>
 subprocess.run(
    [
        "npx",
        "playwright",
        "screenshot",
        "--full-page",
        url,
        output,
    ],
    capture_output=True,
) 
<p>This could take a full page screenshot, but that CLI tool wasn't flexible enough to take screenshots of specific elements. So I needed to switch to the Playwright programmatic API.</p>
<p>I started out trying to get Python to generate and pass JavaScript to the Node.js library... and then I spotted the official <a href="https://playwright.dev/python/docs/intro">Playwright for Python</a> package.</p>
 <code>pip install playwright
</code> 
<p>It's amazing! It has the exact same functionality as the JavaScript library - the same classes, the same methods. Everything just works, in both languages.</p>
<p>I was curious how they pulled this off, so I dug inside the <code>playwright</code> Python package in my <code>site-packages</code> folder... and found it bundles a full Node.js binary executable and uses it to bridge the two worlds! What a crazy hack.</p>
<p>Thanks to Playwright, the entire implementation of <code>shot-scraper</code> is currently just <a href="https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper/blob/0.3/shot_scraper/cli.py">181 lines of Python code</a> - it's all glue code tying together a <a href="https://click.palletsprojects.com/">Click</a> CLI interface with some code that calls Playwright to do the actual work.</p>
<p>I couldn't be more impressed with Playwright. I'll definitely be using it for other projects - for one thing, I think I'll finally be able to add automated tests to my <a href="https://datasette.io/desktop">Datasette Desktop</a> Electron application.</p>
 Hooking shot-scraper up to GitHub Actions 
<p>I built <code>shot-scraper</code> very much with GitHub Actions in mind.</p>
<p>My <a href="https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper-demo">shot-scraper-demo</a> repository is my first live demo of the tool.</p>
<p>Once a day, it runs <a href="https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper-demo/blob/3fdd9d3e79f95d9d396aeefd5bf65e85a7700ef4/.github/workflows/shots.yml">this shots.yml</a> file, generates two screenshots and commits them back to the repository.</p>
<p>One of them is the tutorial screenshot described above.</p>
<p>The other is a screenshot of the list of "recently spotted owls" from <a href="https://www.owlsnearme.com/?place=127871">this page</a> on <a href="https://www.owlsnearme.com/">owlsnearme.com</a>. I wanted a page that would change on an occasional basis, to demonstrate GitHub's neat image diffing interface.</p>
<p>I may need to change that demo though! That page includes "spotted 5 hours ago" text, which means that there's almost always a tiny pixel difference, <a href="https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper-demo/commit/bc86510f49b6f8d6728c9f1880b999c83361dd5a#diff-897c3444fbbb2033cbba5840da4994d01c3f396e0cdf4b0613d7f410db9887e0">like this one</a> (use the "swipe" comparison tool to watch 6 hours ago change to 7 hours ago under the top left photo).</p>
<p>Storing image files that change frequently in a free repository on GitHub feels rude to me, so please use this tool cautiously there!</p>
 What's next? 
<p>I had ambitious plans to add utilities to the tool that would <a href="https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper/issues/9">help with annotations</a>, such as adding pink arrows and drawing circles around different elements on the page.</p>
<p>I've shelved those plans for the moment: as the demo above shows, the JavaScript hook is good enough. I may revisit this later once common patterns have started to emerge.</p>
<p>So really, my next step is to start using this tool for my own projects - to generate screenshots for my documentation.</p>
<p>I'm also very interested to see what kinds of things other people use this for.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>College students are supposed to become leaders of thought and action in later life. It is expected they will profit from a college education by developing an open and alert mind to be able to cope boldly with everyday problems in economics and politics. They cannot do this unless they learn to think independently for themselves and to stand fast for their convictions. Is the student at A and M encouraged to do this? Is he permitted to do it? The answer is sadly in the negative.</p>

<p>Little did he know that current students would be dealing with this shit 85 years later with a group of former students with nothing better to do than infiltrate student-run organizations from freshman orientation to the newspaper.  But shocking no one, they were too incompetent to maintain the privacy of the school regents who met with them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to meeting minutes from Dec. 1, 2020, the Rudder Association secured the attendance of four members of the A&amp;M System Board of Regents. The meeting minutes obtained by The Battalion were censored by TRA to remove the names of the regents in the meeting as well as other “highly sensitive information.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“DO NOT USE THEIR NAMES BEYOND THE RUDDER BOARD. They do not wish to be outed,” the minutes read on the regents in attendance.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Further examination by The Battalion revealed, however, that the censored text could be copied and pasted into a text document to be viewed in its entirety due to TRA using a digital black highlighter to censor.</p>

<p>Well done, Battalion.</p>

  <p>Summary:      Authenticity and privacy are usually traded off against each other. The tradeoff is a tricky one that can lead to the over collection of data.</p>




<p>
    At a recent <a href="https://www.meetup.com/utah-ssi-meetup/">Utah SSI Meetup</a>, <a href="https://prosapien.com/about/">Sam Smith</a> discussed the tradeoff between privacy, authenticity and confidentiality. Authenticity allows parties to a conversation to know to whom they are talking. Confidentiality ensures that the content of the conversation is protected from others. These three create a tradespace because you can't achieve all three at the same time. Since confidentiality is easily achieved through encryption, we're almost always trading off privacy and authenticity. The following diagram illustrates these tradeoffs.
</p>


	<a></a>
	Privacy, authenticity, and confidentiality must be traded against each other. (click to enlarge)


<p>
    
</p>

<p>
    Authenticity is difficult to achieve in concert with privacy because it affects the metadata of a conversation. Often it requires others besides the parties to a conversation potentially knowing who else is participating—that is, it requires non-repudiation. Specifically, if Alice and Bob are communicating, not only does Alice need to know she's talking to Bob, but also needs the ability to prove to others that she and Bob were communicating.
</p>

<p>
    As an example, modern banking laws include a provision known as Know Your Customer (KYC). KYC requires that banks be able to identify the parties to transactions. That's why, when you open a bank account, they ask for numerous identity documents. The purpose is to enable law enforcement to determine the actors behind transactions deemed illegal (hopefully with a warrant). So, banking transactions are strong on authenticity, but weak on privacy1.
</p>

<p>
    Authenticity is another way of classifying digital relationships. Many of the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/08/ephemeral_relationships.shtml">relationships we have are (or could be) ephemeral</a>, relying more on what you have than who you are. For example, a movie ticket doesn't identify who you are but does identify what you are: one of N people allowed to occupy a seat in a specific theater at a specific time. You establish an ephemeral relationship with the ticket taker, she determines that your ticket is valid, and you're admitted to the theater. This relationship, unless the ticket taker knows you, is strong on privacy, weak on authenticity, and doesn't need much confidentiality either.
</p>

<p>
    A credit card transaction is another interesting case that shows the complicated nature of privacy and authenticity in many relationships. To the merchant, a credit card says something about you, what you are (i.e., someone with sufficient credit to make a purchase) rather than who you are—strong on privacy, relatively weak on authenticity. To be sure, the merchant does have a permanent identifier for you (the card number) but is unlikely to be asked to use it outside the transaction.
</p>

<p>
    But, because of KYC, you are well known to your bank, and the rules of the credit card network ensure that you can be identified by transaction for things like chargebacks and requests from law enforcement. So, this relationship has strong authenticity but weaker privacy guarantees. 
</p>

<p>
    The tradeoff between privacy and authenticity is informed by the Law of Justifiable Parties (see <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/stories/2005/05/13/TheLawsOfIdentity.pdf">Kim Cameron's Laws of Identity</a>) that says disclosures should be made only to entities who have a need to know. Justifiable Parties doesn't say everything should be maximally private. But it does say that we need to carefully consider our justification for increasing authenticity at the expense of privacy. Too often, digital systems opt for knowing who when they could get by with what. In the language we're developing here, they create authenticated, permanent relationships, at the expense of privacy, when they could use pseudonymous, ephemeral relationships and preserve privacy.
</p>

<p>
    Trust is often given as the reason for trading privacy for authenticity. This is the result of a mistaken understanding of trust. What many <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160791X20303067">interactions really need is confidence</a> in the data being exchanged. As an example, consider how we ensure a patron at a bar is old enough to drink. We could create a registry and have everyone who wants to drink register with the bar, providing several identifying documents, including birthdate. Every time you order, you'd authenticate, proving you're the person who established the account and allowing the bar to prove who ordered what when. This system relies on who you are.
</p>

<p>
    But this isn't how we do it. Instead, your relationship with the bar is ephemeral. To prove you're old enough to drink you show the bartender or server an ID card that includes your birthday. They don't record any of the information on the ID card, but rather use the birthday to establish what you are: a person old enough to drink. This system favors privacy over authenticity.
</p>

<p>
    The bar use case doesn't require trust, the willingness to rely on someone else to perform actions on the trustor's behalf, in the ID card holder2. But it does require confidence in the data. The bar needs to be confident that the person drinking is over the legal age. Both systems provide that confidence, but one protects privacy, and the other does not. Systems that need trust generally need more authenticity and thus have less privacy.
</p>

<p>
    In general, authenticity is needed in a digital relationship when there is a need for legal recourse and accountability. Different applications will judge the risk inherent in a relationship differently and hence have different tradeoffs between privacy and authenticity. I say this with some reticence since I know in many organizations, the risk managers are incredibly influential with business leaders and will push for accountability where it might not really be needed, just to be safe. I hope identity professionals can provide cover for privacy and the arguments for why confidence is often all that is needed.
</p>

 


<a></a>
 Notes 
 
     Remember, this doesn't mean that banking transactions are public, but that others besides the participants can know who participated in the conversation. 
     The bar does need to trust the issuer of the ID card. That is a different discussion.

  <p>Summary:      With privacy, we're almost never dealing with absolutes. Absolute digital privacy can be achieved by simply never using the Internet. But that also means being absolutely cut off from online interaction. Consequently, privacy is a spectrum, and we must choose where we should be on that spectrum, taking all factors into consideration.</p>





<p>
    Ask ten people what privacy is and you'll likely get twelve different answers. The reason for the disparity is that your feelings about privacy depend on context and your experience. Privacy is not a purely technical issue, but a human one. Long before computers existed, people cared about and debated privacy. Future U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis defined it as "the right to be left alone" in 1890.
</p>

<p>
    Before the Web became a ubiquitous phenomenon, people primarily thought of privacy in terms of government intrusion. But the march of technological progress means that private companies probably have much more data about you than your government. Ad networks and the valuation of platforms based on how well they display ads to their users has led to the wide-spread surveillance of people, usually without them knowing the extent or consequences.
</p>

<p>
    The International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP) <a href="https://iapp.org/resources/glossary/">defines four classes of privacy</a>:
</p>


<p>
    Bodily Privacy—The protection of a person's physical being and any invasion thereof. This includes practices like genetic testing, drug testing, or body cavity searches.
</p>

<p>
    Communications Privacy—The protection of the means of correspondence, including postal mail, telephone conversations, electronic mail, and other forms of communication.
</p>

<p>
    Information Privacy—The claim of individuals, groups, or organizations to determine for themselves when, how, and to what extent information about them is communicated to others.
</p>

<p>
    Territorial Privacy—Placing limitations on the ability of others to intrude into an individual's environment. Environment can be more than just the home, including workplaces, vehicles, and public spaces. Intrusions of territorial privacy can include video surveillance or ID checks.
</p>

<p>
    While Bodily and Territorial Privacy can be issues online, Communications and Information Privacy are the ones we worry about the most and the ones most likely to have a digital identity component. To begin a discussion of online privacy, we first need to be specific about what we mean when we talk about online conversations.
</p>

<p>
    Each online interaction consists of packets of data flowing between parties. For our purposes, consider that a conversation. Even a simple Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo request packet is a conversation as we're defining it—the message needn't be meaningful to humans.
</p>

<p>
    Conversations have content and they have metadata—the information about the conversation. In an ICMP echo, there's only metadata—the TCP and ICMP headers1. The headers include information like the source and destination IP addresses, the TTL (time-to-live), type of message, checksums, and so on. In a more complex protocol, say SMTP for email, there would also be content—the message—in addition to the metadata.
</p>

<p>
    Communication Privacy is concerned with metadata. Confidentiality is concerned with content2. Put another way, for a conversation to be private, only the parties to the conversation should know who the other participants are. More generally, privacy concerns the control of any metadata about an online conversation so that only parties to the conversation know the metadata.
</p>

<p>
    Defined in this way, online privacy may appear impossible. After all, the Internet works by passing packets from router to router, all of which can see the source IP address and must know the destination IP address. Consequently, at the packet level, there's no online privacy.
</p>

<p>
    But consider the use of TLS (Transport Layer Security) to create an encrypted web channel between the browser and the server . At the packet level, the routers will know (and the operators of the routers can know) the IP addresses of the encrypted packets going back and forth. If a third party can correlate those IP addresses with the actual participants, then the conversation isn't absolutely private. 
</p>

<p>
    But other metadata—the headers—is private. Beyond the host name and information needed to set up the TLS connection, all the rest of the headers are encrypted. This includes cookies and the URL path. So, someone eavesdropping on the conversation will know the server name, but not the specific place on the site the browser connected to. For example, suppose Alice visits Utah Valley University's Title IX office (where sexual misconduct, discrimination, harassment, and retaliation are reported) by pointing her browser at <code>uvu.edu/titleix</code>. With TLS an eavesdropper could know Alice connected to Utah Valley University, but not know that she connected to web site for the Title IX office because the path is encrypted.
</p>

<p>
    Extending this example, we can easily see the difference between privacy and confidentiality. If the Title IX office were located at a subdomain of <code>uvu.edu</code>, say <code>titleix.uvu.edu</code>, then an eavesdropper would be able to tell that Alice had connected to the Title IX web site, even if the conversation were protected by a TLS connection. The content that was sent to Alice and that she sent back would be confidential, but the important metadata showing that Alice connected to the Title IX office would not be private.
</p>

<p>
    This example introduces another important term to this discussion: authenticity. If Alice goes to <code>uvu.edu</code> instead of <code>titleix.uvu.edu</code> then an eavesdropper cannot easily establish the authenticity of who Alice is speaking to at UVU—there are too many possibilities. Depending on how easily correlated Alice's IP number is with Alice, an eavesdropper can't reliably authenticate Alice either. So, while Alice's conversation with the Title IX office through <code>uvu.edu</code> is not absolutely private, it is probably private enough because we can't easily authenticate the parties to the conversation from the metadata alone. 
</p>

<p>
    Information Privacy, on the other hand, is distinguished from Communications Privacy online because it usually concerns content, rather than metadata. When Alice connects with the Title IX office, to extend the example from the previous paragraph, she might transmit data to the office, possibly by filling out Web forms, or even just by authenticating, allowing the Web site to identify Alice and correlate other information with her. All of this is done inside the confidential channel provided by the TLS connection. But Alice will still be concerned about the privacy of the information she's communicated.
</p>

<p>
    Information privacy quickly gets out of the technical realm and into policy. How will Alice's information be handled? Who will see it? Will it be shared? With whom and under what conditions? These are all policy questions that impact the privacy of information that Alice willingly shared. Information privacy is generally about who controls disclosure. 
</p>

<p>
    Communications Privacy often involves the involuntary collection of metadata—surveillance. Information Privacy usually involves policies and practices for handling data that has been voluntarily provided. Of course, there are places where these two overlap. Data created from metadata becomes personally identifying information (PII), subject to privacy concerns that might be addressed by policy. Still, the distinction between Communications and Information Privacy is useful.
</p>

<p>
    The intersection of Communications and Information privacy is sometimes called Transactional3 or Social Privacy. Transaction privacy is worth exploring as a separate category because transactional privacy is always evaluated in a specific context. Thus, it speaks to people's real concerns and their willingness to trade off privacy for a perceived benefit in a specific transaction. Transactional privacy concerns can be more transient.
</p>

<p>
    The modern Web is replete with transactions that involve both metadata and content data. The risks of this data being used in ways that erode individual privacy are great. And because the mechanisms are obscure—even to Web professionals—people can't make good privacy decisions about the transactions they engage in. Transactional privacy is consequently an important lens for evaluating the privacy rights of people and they ways technology, policy, regulation, and the law can protect them.</p>


<p>
    With privacy, we're almost never dealing with absolutes. Absolute digital privacy can be achieved by simply never using the Internet. But that also means being absolutely cut off from online interaction. Consequently, privacy is a spectrum, and we must choose where we should be on that spectrum, taking all factors into consideration. Since confidentiality is easily achieved through encryption, we're almost always trading off privacy and authentication. <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2022/03/privacy_authenticity_and_confidentiality.shtml">More on that next week</a>.
</p>

 
<a></a>
 Notes 

 
     ICMP packets can have data in the packet, but it's optional and almost never set.  
     This distinction between privacy and confidentiality isn't often made in casual conversation where people often say they want privacy when they really mean confidentiality. 
     I have seen the term "transactional privacy" used to describe the idea of people being sellers of their own data outright. That is not the sense I'm using it. I'm speaking more generally of the interactions that take place online.

<p>If so, we can now describe each one of those categories in more detail, and
understand the specific behaviors they necessarily need to engage in.</p>
<p>For example, the scientist will welcome and produce copious objective evidence.
The demagogue, likely, will provide far less evidence, and if so, point to
other people and their statements as their evidence. Those other people are
likely either other demagogues or just crooks.</p>
<p>If we could annotate people on-line with these four categories, we could
even run a PageRank-style algorithm on it to figure out which is which.

primary driver of revenue for “free” on-line services?</p>

<p>Is the world going to croak?</p>
<p>Put in geological terms, will the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phanerozoic">Phanerozoic</a> eon, which began with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambrian_explosion">Cambrian explosion</a> a half billion years ago, end at the close of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropocene">Anthropocene epoch</a>, when the human species, which has permanently put its mark on the Earth, commits suicide with nuclear weapons? This became a lot more plausible as soon as Putin <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/putin-orders-nuclear-deterrent-forces-high-alert-tensions-build-ukrain-rcna17853">rattled</a> his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction">nuclear saber</a>.</p>
<p>Well, life will survive, even if humans do not. And that will happen whether or not the globe warms as much as the <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/reports/">IPCC</a> assures us it will. If temperatures in the climate of our current <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interglacial">interglacial</a> interval peak with both poles free of ice, the Mississippi river will meet the Atlantic at what used to be St. Louis. Yet life will abound, as life does, at least until the Sun gets so large and hot that photosynthesis stops and the phanerozoic finally ends. That time is about a half-billion years away. That might seem like a long time, but given the age of the Earth itself—about 4.5 billion years—life here is much closer to the end than the beginning.</p>
<p>Now let’s go back to human time.</p>
<p>I’ve been on the planet for almost 75 years, which in the grand scheme is a short ride. But it’s enough to have experienced history being bent some number of times. So far I count six.</p>
<p>First was on November 22, 1963, when John F. Kennedy was assassinated. This was when The Fifties actually ended and The Sixties began. (My great aunt <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/426418080">Eva Quakenbush</a>, née Searls or Searles—it was spelled both ways—told us what it was like when Lincoln was shot and she was 12 years old. “It changed everything,” she said. So did the JFK assassination.)</p>
<p>The second was the one-two punch of the Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy assassinations, on April 4 and June 6, 1968. The former was a massive setback for both the civil rights movement and nonviolence. And neither has fully recovered. The latter assured the election of Richard Nixon and another six years of the Vietnam war.</p>
<p>The third was the Internet, which began to&nbsp;take off in the mid-1990s. I date the steep start of hockey stick curve to April 30, 1995, when the last backbone within the Internet that had forbidden commercial traffic (NSFnet) shut down, uncorking a tide of e-commerce that is still rising.</p>
<p>The fourth was 9/11, in 2001. That suckered the U.S. into wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and repositioned the country from the world’s leading peacekeeper to the world’s leading war-maker—at least until Russia stepped up.</p>
<p>The fifth was the Covid pandemic, which hit the world in early 2020 and is still with us, causing all sorts of changes, from crashes in supply chains to inflation to complete new ways for people to work, travel, vote, and think.</p>
<p>Sixth is the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine">2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine</a>, which began on February 24, 2022, just eleven days ago as I write this.</p>
<p>Big a thing as this last bend is—and it’s huge—there are too many ways to make sense of it all:</p>

<p>I didn’t list the threat of thermonuclear annihilation among the six big changes in history I’ve experienced because I was raised with it. Several times a year we would “duck and cover” under our desks when the school would set off air raid sirens. Less frequent than fire drills, these were far more scary, because we all knew we were toast, being just five miles by air from Manhattan, which was surely in the programmed crosshairs on one or more Soviet nukes.</p>
<p>Back then I put so little faith in adult wisdom, and its collective expression in government choices, that I had a bucket list of places I’d like to see before nuclear blasts or fallout doomed us all. My top two destinations were the Grand Canyon and California: exotic places for a kid whose farthest family venturings from New Jersey were to see relatives in North Carolina and North Dakota. (Of no importance but of possible interest is that I’ve now been a citizen of California for 37 years, married to an Angelino for 32 of those, and it still seems exotic to me. Mountains next to cities and beaches? A tradition of wildfires and earthquakes? Whoa.)</p>
<p>What’s around the corner we turned two Thursdays ago? Hard to tell, in spite of all that’s being said by Wise Ones in the links above. One things I do know for sure: People have changed, because more and more of them are digital now, connected to anybody and anything at any distance, and able to talk, produce “content” and do business—and to look and think past national and territorial boundaries. We make our tools and then our tools make us, McLuhan taught. Also,&nbsp;all media work us over completely. We have been remade into digital beings by our wires, waves, and phones. This raises optionalities in too many ways to list.</p>
<p>I’m an optimist by nature, and since the ’90s have been correctly labeled a cyber-utopian. (Is there anything more utopian than <a href="https://cluetrain.com/">The Cluetrain Manifesto</a>?) To me, the tiny light at the end of Ukraine’s tunnel is a provisional belief that bad states—especially ones led by lying bastards who think nothing of wasting thousands or millions of innocent lives just to build an empire—can’t win World War Wired. Unless, that is, the worst of those bastards launches the first nuke and we all go “gribbit.”</p>
<p>Our challenge as a species, after we stop Russia’s land grab from becoming a true world war, is to understand fully how we can live and work in the Wired World as digital as well as physical beings.</p>

<p>This week, <a href="https://twitter.com/tplooker">Tobias Looker</a> and I submitted two individual Internet Drafts for consideration by the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/cose/about/">COSE working group</a>.</p>
<p>The first is “<a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-looker-cose-bls-key-representations-00.html">Barreto-Lynn-Scott Elliptic Curve Key Representations for JOSE and COSE</a>“, the abstract of which is:</p>
<blockquote><p><br>
This specification defines how to represent cryptographic keys for the pairing-friendly elliptic curves known as Barreto-Lynn-Scott (BLS), for use with the key representation formats of JSON Web Key (JWK) and COSE (COSE_Key).<br>
</p></blockquote>
<p>These curves are used in Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) representations for JOSE and COSE, where the ZKPs use the CFRG drafts “<a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-irtf-cfrg-pairing-friendly-curves-10.html">Pairing-Friendly Curves</a>” and “<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-bls-signature-04">BLS Signatures</a>“.</p>
<p>The second is “<a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-looker-cose-cwt-claims-in-headers-00.html">CBOR Web Token (CWT) Claims in COSE Headers</a>“, the abstract of which is:</p>
<blockquote><p><br>
This document describes how to include CBOR Web Token (CWT) claims in the header parameters of any COSE structure. This functionality helps to facilitate applications that wish to make use of CBOR Web Token (CWT) claims in encrypted COSE structures and/or COSE structures featuring detached signatures, while having some of those claims be available before decryption and/or without inspecting the detached payload.<br>
</p></blockquote>
<p>JWTs define a mechanism for replicating claims as header parameter values, but CWTs have been missing the equivalent capability to date.  The use case is the same as that which motivated <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519.html#section-5.3">Section 5.3 of JWT</a> “Replicating Claims as Header Parameters” – encrypted CWTs for which you’d like to have unencrypted instances of particular claims to determine how to process the CWT prior to decrypting it.</p>
<p>We plan to discuss both with the COSE working group at <a href="https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/113/">IETF 113 in Vienna</a>.</p>

  Convergent Wisdom is utilizing the knowledge gained from studying multiple solutions that approach a similar outcome in different ways in order to choose the appropriate solution for the problem at hand.

<p>I was recently watching a MIT Opencourseware video on Youtube titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pb3z2w9gDg">“Introduction to ‘The Society of Mind’”</a> which is a series of lectures (or as the author refers to them “seminars”) by Marvin Minsky. While watching the first episode of this course the professors puts forth an interesting theory about what grants humans the capability to handle a variety of problems while machines remain limited in their capacity to generically compute solutions to problems. In this theory he alludes to the concept that humans “resourcefullness” is what grants us this capability which to paraphrase is the ability for humans to leverage a variety of different paths to identify a variety of solutions to the same problem. All of which can be used in a variety of different situations in order to develop a solution to the generic problem at hand. While he was describing this theory he made an <a href="https://youtu.be/-pb3z2w9gDg?t=1629">off hand comment</a> about the choice of the word “resourcefullness” positing whether there was a shorter word to describe the concept.</p>

<p>This got me thinking about the lingustical preciseness to describe the concept and I came across a <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/491254/word-describing-multiple-paths-to-the-same-abstract-outcome">very fullfilling suggestion</a> on stack exchange to do just that. They suggested the word “equifinality” which is incredibly precise, but also a bit of a pompous choice for a general audience. Albeit, great for the audience he was addressing. The second suggestion sent me down a tangent of thought that I find very enticing though. “Convergent” is a word that’s commonly used to describe this in common tongue today and more importantly can be paired with wisdom to describe a new concept. I’m choosing to define the concept of “convergent wisdom” as utilizing the knowledge gained from studying multiple solutions that approach the same outcome in different ways in order to choose the appropriate solution for the problem at hand.</p>

<p>What’s interesting about the concept of convergent wisdom is that it suitably describes the feedback loop that humans exploit in order to gain the capability of generalizable problem solving. For example, in chemical synthesis the ability to understand the pathway of creating an exotic compound is nearly as important as the compound itself because it can affect the feasiblity of mass production of the compound. In manufacteuring similarly, there are numerous instance of giant discoveries occuring (battery technology is the one that comes to mind first) which then fall short when it comes time to manufateur the product. In both of these instances the ability to understand the chosen path is nearly as important as the solution itself.</p>

<p>So why does this matter and why define the concept? This concept seems incredibly important to the ability to build generically intelligent machines. Today, it seems much of the focus of the artificial intelligence feild focuses primarily on the outcome while treating the process as a hidden and unimportant afterthought up until the point in which the algorithm starts to produce ethically dubious outcomes as well.</p>

<p>Through the study of not only the inputs and outputs, but also the pathway by with the outcome is achieved I believe the same feedback loop may be able to be formed to produce generalizable computing in machines. Unfortunately, I’m no expert in this space and have tons of reading to do on the topic. So now that I’ve been able to describe and define the topic can anyone point me to the area of study or academic literature which focuses on this aspect of AI?</p>

  Someone stole my Goodreads account; the company failed to recover it, then deleted it. It was all too preventable.

<p>On 12:31pm on February 2, I got an email from <a href="https://www.goodreads.com">Goodreads</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>This is a notice to let you know that the password for your account has been
changed.</p>
<p>If you did not recently reset or change your password, it is possible that
your account has been compromised. If you have any questions about this,
please reach out to us using our Contact Us form. Alternatively, visit
Goodreads Help.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since I had not changed my password, I immediately hit the “Goodreads Help” link
(not the one in the email, mind you) and reported the issue. At 2:40pm I wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I got an email saying my password had been changed. I did not change my
password. I went to the site and tried go log in, but the login failed. I
tried to reset my password, but got an email saying my email is not in the
system.</p>
<p>So someone has compromised the account. Please help me recover it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I also tried to log in, but failed. I tried the app on my phone, and had been
logged out there, too.</p>
<p>The following day at 11:53am, Goodreads replied asking me for a link to my
account. I had no idea what the link to my account was, and since I assumed that
all my information had been changed by the attackers, I didn’t think to search
for it.</p>
<p>Three minutes later, at 11:56, I replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No, I always just used the domain and logged in, or the iOS app. I’ve attached
the last update email I got around 12:30 EST yesterday, in case that helps.
I’ve also attached the email telling me my password had been changed around
2:30 yesterday. That was when I became aware of the fact that the account was
taken over.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A day and half later, at 5:46pm on the 4th, Goodreads support replied to say
that they needed the URL in order to find it and investigate and asked if I
remembered the name on the account. This seemed odd to me, since until at least
the February 2nd it was associated with my name and email address.</p>
<p>I replied 3 minutes later at 5:49:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The name is mine. The username maybe? I’m usually “theory”, “itheory”, or
“justatheory”, though if I set up a username for Goodreads it was ages ago
and never really came up. Where could I find an account link?</p>
<p>Over the weekend I can log into Amazon and Facebook and see if I see any old
integration messages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following day was Saturday the fifth. I logged into Facebook to see what I
could find. I had deleted the link to Goodreads in 2018 (when I also ceased to
use Facebook), but there was still a record of it, so I sent the link ID
Facebook had. I also pointed out that my email address had been associated with
the account for many years until it was changed on Feb 2. Couldn’t they find it
in the history for the account?</p>
<p>I still didn’t know the link to my account, but forwarded the marketing redirect
links that had been in the password change email, as well as an earlier email
with a status on my reading activity.</p>
<p>After I sent the email, I realized I could ask some friends who I knew followed
me on Goodreads to see if they could dig up the link. Within a few minutes my
pal Travis had sent it to me,
<code>https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7346356-david-wheeler</code>. I was surprised,
when I opened it, to see all my information there as I’d left it, no changes. I
still could not log in, however. I immediately sent the link to Goodreads
support (at 12:41pm).</p>
<p>That was the fifth. I did no hear back again until February 9th, when I was
asked if I could provide some information about the account so they could
confirm it was me. The message asked for:</p>
<blockquote>
 
 Any connected apps or devices 
 Pending friend requests to your account 
 Any accounts linked to your Goodreads account (Goodreads accounts can be
linked to Amazon, Apple, Google, and/or Facebook accounts) 
 The name of any private/secret groups of which you are a part 
 Any other account-specific information you can recall 
 
</blockquote>
<p>Since I of course had no access to the account, I replied 30 minutes later with
what information I could recall from memory: my devices, Amazon Kindle
connection (Kindle would sometimes update my reading progress, though not
always), membership in some groups that may or may not have been public, and the
last couple books I’d updated.</p>
<p>Presumably, most of that information was public, and the devices may have been
changed by the hackers. I heard nothing back. I sent followup inquiries on
February 12th and 16th but got no replies.</p>
<p>On February 23rd I <a href="https://twitter.com/theory/status/1496483369781243910">complained on Twitter</a>. Four minutes later <a href="https://twitter.com/goodreads/status/1496484238908178442">@goodreads
replied</a> and I started to hope there might be some progress again. They <a href="https://twitter.com/goodreads/status/1496513088224468992">asked
me</a> to get in touch with Support again, which <a href="https://twitter.com/theory/status/1496515177809944581">i did</a> at 10:59am, sending all
the previous information and context I could.</p>
<p>Then, at 12:38am, this bombshell arrived in my inbox from Goodreads support:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks for your your patience while we looked into this. I have found that
your account was deleted due to suspected suspicious activity. Unfortunately,
once an account has been deleted, all of the account data is permanently
removed from our database to comply with the data regulations which means that
we are unable to retrieve your account or the related data. I know that’s not
the news you wanted and I am sincerely sorry for the inconvenience.Please let
me know if there’s anything else I ​can assist you with.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was stunned. I mean of course there was suspicious activity, the account was
taken over 19 days previously! As of the 5th when I found the link it still
existed, and I had been in touch a number of times previously. Goodreads knew
that the account had been reported stolen and still deleted it?</p>
<p>And no chance of recovery due to compliance rules? I don’t live in the EU, and
even if I was subject to the <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu">GDPR</a> or <a href="https://www.oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">CCPA</a>, there is no provision to delete
my data unless I request it.</p>
<p>WTAF.</p>
<p>So to summarize:</p>
 
 Someone took control of my account on February 2 
 I reported it within hours 
 On February 5 my account was still on Goodreads 
 We exchanged a number of messages 
 By February 23 the account was deleted with no chance of recovery due to
suspicious activity 
 
<p>Because of course there was suspicious activity. I told them there was an issue!</p>
<p>How did this happen? What was the security configuration for my account?</p>
 
 I created an entry for Goodreads in 1Password on January 5, 2012. The
account may have been older than that, but for at least 10 years I’ve had
it, and used it semi-regularly. 
 The password was 16 random ASCII characters generated by 1Password on
October 27, 2018. I create unique random passwords for all of my accounts,
so it would not be found in a breached database (and I have updated all
breached accounts 1Password has identified). 
 The account had no additional factors of authentication or fallbacks to
something like SMS, because Goodreads does not offer them. There was only
my email address and password. 
 On February 2nd someone changed my password.  I had clicked no links in
emails, so phishing is unlikely. Was Goodreads support social-engineered to
let someone else change the password? How did this happen? 
 I exchanged multiple messages with Goodreads support between February 2 and
23rd, to no avail. By February 23rd, my account was gone with all my reviews
and reading lists. 
 
<p>Unlike <a href="https://www.somebits.com/weblog/" title="Some Bits: Nelson’s weblog">Nelson</a>, who’s <a href="https://www.somebits.com/weblog/tech/bad/goodreads-lost-all-my-data.html" title="Some Bits: “Goodreads lost all of my reviews”">account was also recently deleted</a> without chance of
recovery, I had not been making and backups of my data. Never occurred to me,
perhaps because I never put a ton of effort into my Goodreads account, mostly
just tracked reading and a few brief reviews. I’ll miss my reading list the
most. Will have to start a new one on my own machines.</p>
<p>Though all this, Goodreads support were polite but not particularly responsive.
days and then weeks went by without response. The company deleted the account
for suspicious activity an claim no path to recovery for the original owner.
Clearly the company doesn’t give its support people the tools they need to
adequately support cases such as this.</p>
<p>I can think of a number of ways in which these situations can be better handled
and even avoided. In fact, given my current job designing identity systems I’m
going to put a lot of thought into it.</p>
<p>But sadly I’ll be trusting third parties less with my data in the future.
Redundancy and backups are key, but so is adequate account protection.
<a href="https://letterboxd.com" title="Letterboxd • Social film discovery.">Letterboxed</a>, for example, has no multifactor authentication features, making
it vulnerable should someone decide it’s worthwhile to steal accounts to spam

a backup</a>.</p>
<p>You should, too, and backup your Goodreads account regularly. Meanwhile, I’m on
the lookout for a new social reading site that supports multifactor
authentication. But even with that, in the future I’ll post reviews here on Just
a Theory and just reference them, at best, from social sites.</p>
 
<p>Update April 3, 2022: This past week, I finally got some positive news from
Goodreads, two months after this saga began:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Goodreads team would like to apologize for your recent poor experience
with your account. We sincerely value your contribution to the Goodreads
community and understand how important your data is to you. We have
investigated this issue and attached is a complete file of your reviews,
ratings, and shelvings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that’s it, along with some instructions for creating a new account and
loading the data. Still no account recovery, so my old URL is dead and there is
no information about my Goodreads friends. Still, I’m happy to at least have my
lists and reviews recovered. I imported them into a new Goodreads account, then
exported them again and imported them into my new <a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/itheory">StoryGraph profile</a>.</p>

  <p><a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a> now includes its own custom string encoding scheme, which I've called dash encoding. I really didn't want to have to invent something new here, but unfortunately I think this is the best solution to my very particular problem. Some notes on how dash encoding works and why I created it.</p>

<p>Update 18th March 2022: This turned out not to be the right idea for my project after all! I ended up settling on a <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Mar/19/weeknotes/#tilde-encoding">Tilde encoding</a> scheme instead.</p>

 Table names and rows in URLs 
<p>I've put a lot of thought into the design of Datasette's URLs.</p>
<p>Datasette exposes relational databases tables, as both web pages and a JSON API.</p>
<p>Consider a database in a SQLite file called <code>legislators.db</code>, containing a table called <code>legislator_terms</code> (example from <a href="https://datasette.io/tutorials/explore">this tutorial</a>). The URL path to the web interface for that table will be:</p>
 
 <a href="http://congress-legislators.datasettes.com/legislators/legislator_terms">/legislators/legislator_terms</a> 
 
<p>And the JSON API will be here:</p>
 
 <a href="http://congress-legislators.datasettes.com/legislators/legislator_terms.json">/legislators/legislator_terms.json</a> 
 
<p>(Worth noting that Datasette supports other formats here too - <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/csv_export.html">CSV</a> by default, and plugins can add more formats such as <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-geojson">GeoJSON</a> or <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-atom">Atom</a> or <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-ics">iCal</a>.)</p>
<p>Datasette also provides pages (and APIs) for individual rows, identified by their primary key:</p>
 
 <a href="http://congress-legislators.datasettes.com/legislators/legislator_terms/1">/legislators/legislator_terms/1</a> 
 <a href="http://congress-legislators.datasettes.com/legislators/legislator_terms/1.json">/legislators/legislator_terms/1.json</a> 
 
<p>For tables with compound primary keys, these pages can include the primary key values separated by commas:</p>
 
 <a href="https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures/compound_three_primary_keys/a,a,a">/fixtures/compound_three_primary_keys/a,a,a</a> 
 
<p>This is all pretty straightforward so far. But now we get to the challenge: what if a table's name or a row's primary key contains a forward slash or a period character?</p>
<p>This could break the URL scheme!</p>
<p>SQLite table names are allowed to contain almost any character, and Datasette is designed to work with any existing SQLite database - so I can't guarantee that a table with one of those characters won't need to be handled.</p>
<p>Consider a database with two tables - one called <code>legislator_terms</code> and another called <code>legislator_terms/1</code> - given the URL <code>/legislators/legislator_terms/1</code> it's no longer clear if it refers to the table with that name or the row with primary key 1 in the other table!</p>
<p>A similar problem exists for table names with as <code>legislators.csv</code> - which end in a format. Or primary key string values that end in <code>.json</code>.</p>
 Why URL encoding doesn't work here 
<p>Up until now, Datasette has solved this problem using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding">URL percent encoding</a>. This provides a standard mechanism for encoding "special" characters in URLs.</p>
<p><code>legislator_terms/1</code> encodes to <code>legislator_terms%2F1</code></p>
<p>This should be enough to solve the problem. The URL to that weirdly named table can now be:</p>
<p><code>/legislators/legislator_terms%2F1</code></p>
<p>When routing the URL, the application can take this into account and identify that this it a table named <code>legislator_terms/1</code>, as opposed to a request for the row with ID <code>1</code> in the <code>legislator_terms</code> table.</p>
<p>There are two remaining problems.</p>
<p>Firstly, the "." character is ignored by URL encoding, so we still can't tell the difference between <code>/db/table.json</code> and a table called <code>table.json</code>. I worked around this issue in Datasette by supporting an optional alternative <code>?_format=json</code> parameter, but it's <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1439">messy and confusing</a>.</p>
<p>Much more seriously, it turns out there are numerous common pieces of web infrastructure that "helpfully" decode escaped characters in URLs before passing them on to the underlying web application!</p>
<p>I first encountered this in the ASGI standard itself, which decoded characters in the <code>path</code> field before they were passed to the rest of the application.I submitted <a href="https://github.com/django/asgiref/issues/87#issuecomment-500168070">a PR</a> adding <code>raw_path</code> to ASGI precisely to work around this problem for Datasette.</p>
<p>Over time though, the problem kept cropping up. Datasette aims to run on as many hosting platforms as possible. I've seen URL escaping applied at a higher level enough times now to be very suspicious of any load balancer or proxy or other web server mechanism that might end up executing between Datasette and the rest of the web.</p>

<p>Update: Flask core maintainer David Lord <a href="https://twitter.com/davidism/status/1500251083070787585">confirms on Twitter</a> that this is a long-standing known problem:</p>

<blockquote cite="https://twitter.com/davidism/status/1500251083070787585"><p>This behavior in Apache/nginx/etc is why WSGI/ASGI can't specify "literal URL the user typed in", because anything in front of the app might modify slashes or anything else. So all the spec can provide is "decoded URL".</p></blockquote>

<p>So, I need a way of encoding a table name that might include <code>/</code> and <code>.</code> characters in a way that will survive some other layer of the stack decoding URL encoded strings in the URL path before Datasette gets to see them!</p>
 Introducing dash encoding 
<p>That's where dash encoding comes in. I tried to design the fastest, simplest encoding mechanism I could that would solve this very specific problem.</p>
<p>Loose requirements:</p>
 
 Reversible - it's crucial to at any possible value survives a round-trip through the encoding 
 Avoid changing the string at all if possible. Otherwise I could use something like base64, but I wanted to keep the name in the URL as close to readable as possible 
 Survive interference by proxies and load balancer that might try to be helpful 
 Fast to apply the transformation 
 As simple as possible 
 Easy to implement, including in languages other than Python 
 
<p>Dash encoding consists of three simple steps:</p>
 
 Replace all single hyphen characters <code>-</code> with two hyphens <code>--</code>
 
 Replace any forward slash <code>/</code> character with hyphen forward slash <code>-/</code>
 
 Replace any period character <code>.</code> with hyphen period <code>-.</code>
 
 
<p>To reverse the encoding, run those steps backwards.</p>
<p>Here the Python implementation of this encoding scheme:</p>
 def dash_encode(s: str) -&gt; str:
     "Returns dash-encoded string - for example ``/foo/bar`` -&gt; ``-/foo-/bar``"
     return s.replace("-", "--").replace(".", "-.").replace("/", "-/")

def dash_decode(s: str) -&gt; str:
     "Decodes a dash-encoded string, so ``-/foo-/bar`` -&gt; ``/foo/bar``"
     return s.replace("-/", "/").replace("-.", ".").replace("--", "-") 
<p>And the pytest tests for it:</p>
 @pytest.mark.parametrize(
     "original,expected",
     (
         ("abc", "abc"),
         ("/foo/bar", "-/foo-/bar"),
         ("/-/bar", "-/---/bar"),
         ("-/db-/table---.csv-.csv", "---/db---/table-------.csv---.csv"),
     ),
 )
 def test_dash_encoding(original, expected):
     actual = utils.dash_encode(original)
     assert actual == expected
     # And test round-trip
     assert original == utils.dash_decode(actual) 
<p>Here's <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/commit/d1cb73180b4b5a07538380db76298618a5fc46b6">the full commit</a>.</p>
<p>This meets my requirements.</p>
 Capturing these with a regular expression 
<p>There was one remaining challenge. Datasette uses regular expressions - inspired by Django - to route requests to the correct page.</p>
<p>I wanted to use a regular expression to extract out dash encoded values, that could also distinguish them from <code>/</code> and <code>-</code> and <code>.</code> characters that were not encoded in that way.</p>
<p>Here's the pattern I came up with for strings matching this pattern:</p>
<p><code>([^\/\-\.]*|(\-/)|(\-\.)|(\-\-))*</code></p>
<p>Broken down:</p>
 
 
<code>[^\/\-\.]*</code> means 0 or more characters that are NOT one of <code>.</code> or <code>/</code> or <code>-</code> - since we don't care about those characters at all 
 
<code>(\-/)</code> means the explicit sequence <code>-/</code>
 
 
<code>(\-\.)</code> means the explicit sequence <code>-.</code>
 
 
<code>(\-\-)</code> means the explicit sequence <code>--</code>
 
 Those four are wrapped in a group combined with the <code>|</code> or operator 
 The group is then wrapped in a <code>(..)*</code> - specifying that it can repeat as many times as you like 
 
<p>A better way to break down this regular expression is visually, <a href="https://www.debuggex.com/r/KYfCocdmuBHxHETv">using Debuggex</a>:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Combining this into the full regular expression that matches a <code>/database/table.format</code> path is even messier, due to the need to add non-capturing group syntax <code>(?:..)</code> and named groups <code>(?P&lt;name&gt;...)</code> - it ends up looking like this:</p>
<p><code>^/(?P&lt;database&gt;[^/]+)/(?P&lt;table&gt;(?:[^\/\-\.]*|(?:\-/)*|(?:\-\.)*|(?:\-\-)*)*?)\.(?P&lt;format&gt;\w+)?$</code></p>
<p>Visualized <a href="https://www.debuggex.com/r/aTF6lx5JpaMN6UYz">with Debuggex</a>:</p>
<p></p>

<p>Update: Thanks to suggestions <a href="https://twitter.com/dracos/status/1500236433809973248">from Matthew Somerville</a> I simplified this further to:</p>

<p><code>^/(?P&lt;database&gt;[^/]+)/(?P&lt;table&gt;[^\/\-\.]*|\-/|\-\.|\-\-)*(?P&lt;format&gt;\.\w+)?$</code></p>

<p></p>

 Next steps: implementation 
<p>I'm currently working on integrating it into Datasette in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/pull/1648">this PR</a>. The full history of my thinking around this problem can be found <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1439">in issue 1439</a>, with comments stretching back to August last year!</p>

<p>There’s a thread in a list I’m on titled “NFTs are a Scam.”&nbsp;I know too little about NFTs to do more than dump here three thoughts I shared on the list in response to a post that suggested that owning digital seemed to be a mania of some kind. Here goes…</p>
<p>First, <a href="https://searls.com/whitman.html">from Walt Whitman</a>, who said he “could turn and live for awhile with the animals,” because,</p>
<blockquote><p>They do not sweat and whine about their condition.<br>
They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins.<br>
Not one is dissatisfied.<br>
Not one is demented with the mania of owning things.</p></blockquote>
<p>Second, the Internet is <a href="https://worldofends.com/#BM_8">NEA</a>, meaning,</p>
<blockquote><p>No one owns it<br>
Everyone can use it<br>
Anyone can improve it</p></blockquote>
<p>Kind of like the Universe that way.</p>
<p>What makes the Internet an inter-net is an <a href="https://worldofends.com/#BM2">agreement</a>: that every network within it will pass packets from any one endpoint to any other, regardless of origin or destination. That agreement is a protocol: TCP/IP. Agreeing to use that protocol is like molecules agreeing to use gravity or the periodic table. Everything everyone does while operating or using the Internet is gravy atop TCP/IP. The Web is also NEA. So is email. Those are held together by simple protocols too.</p>
<p>Third is that the sure sign of a good idea is that it’s easy to do bad things with it. Look at email, which is 99.x% spam. Yet I’m writing one here and you’re reading it.&nbsp;NFT’s are kind of like QR codes in the early days after <a href="https://www.qrcode.com/en/history/">the patent’s release to the word by Denso Wave</a> early in this millennium. I remember some really smart people calling QR codes “robot barf.” Still, good things happened.</p>
<p>So, if bad things are being done with NFTs, that might be a good sign.</p>
 
<p>The image above is of a window into the barn that for several decades served the Crissman family in Graham, North Carolina. It was toward the back of their 17 acres of beautiful land there. I have many perfect memories of time spent on that land with my aunt, uncle, five cousins and countless visitors. The property is an apartment complex now, I’m told.</p>

<p>2021 was a challenging year in many ways. Other than the global pandemic, many things changed in my life (some good, some bad), and it was a somewhat stressful year.</p>

<p>In March of 2021, I almost died due to a gastrointestinal bleed (a freak accident caused by a routine procedure). Luckily, I survived the incident due to my amazing wife calling 911 at the right time and the fantastic paramedics and doctors at my local hospital, but it was a terrifying ordeal.</p>

<p>While I was in recovery, I spent a lot of time thinking about what I wanted to do when feeling better. How I wanted to spend the limited time I have left. There are lots of things I want to spend my time doing: working on meaningful projects, having fun experiences with family and friends, going on camping and hiking trips, writing, etc.</p>

<p>The process of thinking through everything I wanted to do was, in and of itself, incredibly cathartic. The more time I spent reflecting on my thoughts and life, the better I felt. There’s something magical about taking dedicated time out of your day to write about your thoughts and consider the big questions seriously.</p>

<p>Without thinking much about it, I found myself journaling every day.</p>

<p>It’s been just about a year since I first started journaling, and since then, I’ve written almost every day with few exceptions. In this time, journaling has made a tremendous impact on my life, mood, and relationships. Journaling has quickly become the most impactful of all the habits I’ve developed over the years.</p>

 Benefits of Journaling 

<p>There are numerous reasons to journal, but these are the primary benefits I’ve personally noticed after a year of journaling.</p>

<p>Journaling helps clear your mind.</p>

<p>I have a noisy inner monologue, and throughout the day, I’m constantly being interrupted by ideas, questions, and concerns. When I take a few minutes each day to write these thoughts down and think through them, it puts my brain at ease and allows me to relax and get them off my mind.</p>

<p>Journaling helps put things in perspective.</p>

<p>I’ve often found myself upset or frustrated about something, only to realize later in the day while writing about how insignificant the problem is. The practice of writing things down brings a certain level of rationality to your thoughts that aren’t always immediately apparent.</p>

<p>I often discover that even the “big” problems in my life have obvious solutions I would never have noticed had I not journaled about them.</p>

<p>Journaling preserves memories.</p>

<p>My memory is terrible. If you asked me what I did last month, I’d have absolutely no idea.</p>

<p>Before starting a journal, the only way I could reflect on memories was to look through photos. The only problem with this is that often, while I can remember bits and pieces of what was going on at the time, I can’t remember everything.</p>

<p>As I’m writing my daily journal entry, I’ll include any relevant photos and jot down some context around them – I’ve found that by looking back through these entries with both pictures and stories, it allows me to recall everything.</p>

<p>And… As vain as it is, I hope that someday I’ll be able to pass these journals along to family members so that, if they’re interested, they can get an idea of what sort of person I was, what I did, and the types of things I thought about.</p>

<p>Journaling helps keep your goals on track.</p>

<p>It’s really easy to set a personal goal and forget about it – I’ve done it hundreds of times. But, by writing every day, I’ve found myself sticking to my goals more than ever.</p>

<p>I think this boils down to focus. It would be hard for me to journal every day without writing about my goals and how I’m doing, and that little bit of extra focus and attention goes a long way towards helping me keep myself honest.</p>

<p>It’s fun!</p>

<p>When I started journaling last year, I didn’t intend to do it every day. It just sort of happened.</p>

<p>Each day I found myself wanting to write down some thought or idea, and the more I did it, the more I enjoyed it. Over time, I noticed that I found myself missing it on the few occasions I didn’t journal.</p>

<p>Now, a year in, I look forward to writing a small journal entry every day. It’s part of my wind-down routine at night, and I love it.</p>

 Keeping a Digital and Physical Journal 

<p>Initially, when I started keeping a journal, I had a few simple goals:</p>

 
 I wanted to be able to quickly write (and ideally include photos) in my journal 
 I wanted it to be easy to write on any device (phone, laptop, iPad, etc.) 
 I wanted some way to physically print my journal each year so that I could have a physical book to look back at any time I want – as well as to preserve the memories as digital stuff tends to disappear eventually 
 

<p>With these requirements in mind, I did a lot of research, looking for a suitable solution. I looked at various journaling services and simple alternatives (physical journals, Google Docs, Apple Notes, etc.).</p>

<p>In the end, I decided to start using the <a href="https://dayoneapp.com/">Day One Mac app</a> (works on all Apple devices). I cannot recommend it highly enough if you’re an Apple user.</p>

<p>NOTE: I have no affiliation whatsoever with the Day One app. But it’s incredible.</p>

<p>The Day One app looks beautiful, syncs your journals privately using iCloud, lets you embed photos (and metadata) into entries in a stylish and simple way, makes it incredibly easy to have multiple journals (by topic), track down any entries you’ve previously created, and a whole lot more.</p>

<p></p>

<p>For me, the ultimate feature is the ability to easily create a beautiful looking physical journal whenever I want. Here’s a picture of my journal from 2021.</p>

<p></p>

<p>It’s a bound book with high-quality photos, layouts, etc. It looks astounding. You can customize the book’s cover, include select entries, and make a ton of other customizations I won’t expand on here.</p>

<p>So, my recommendation is that if you’re going to start a journal and want to print it out eventually, use the <a href="https://dayoneapp.com/">Day One app</a> – it’s been absolutely 10⁄10 incredible.</p>

  <p>I published <a href="https://datasette.io/tutorials">two new tutorials</a> for Datasette this week, both focused at end-users of the web application.</p>
<p><a href="https://datasette.io/tutorials/explore">Exploring a database with Datasette</a> shows how to use Datasette as an exploratory data analysis tool, using facets and filters to get a good feeling for a new database.</p>
<p><a href="https://datasette.io/tutorials/learn-sql">Learn SQL with Datasette</a> introduces Datasette's SQL query interface and uses it to teach basic SQL as well as a few more advanced tricks too.</p>
<p>Datasette already has <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/">a lot of documentation</a>, but so far it's all been written to serve people who are administering or customizing Datasette instances. The user interface itself has been mostly undocumented.</p>
<p>Daniele Procida's <a href="https://diataxis.fr">Diátaxis documentation framework</a> describes four categories of documentation: tutorials, how-to guides, technical reference and explanation. Datasette is heavy on  the last two but light on the first.</p>
<p>These <a href="https://datasette.io/tutorials">new tutorials</a> are my initial attempt at redressing the balance. I adapted them from a workshop I presented on Friday at the <a href="https://headlineclub.org/2022/01/28/foia-fest-returns-for-10th-annual-conference/">FOIA Fest</a> data journalism conference in (virtual) Chicago.</p>
<p>Writing documentation for end-users has been an interesting experience! I chose to lean heavily into screenshots, live examples and exercises. I'm <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/discussions/1643">eager for feedback</a> from people to help me understand if what I've done is working, and I'm keen for suggestions on how to improve them and what to write next.</p>
<p>The example database I used for the tutorial is pretty fun: <a href="https://congress-legislators.datasettes.com">https://congress-legislators.datasettes.com</a> - a database of USA senators, congresspeople, presidents and vice presidents built using CC0 data from the absolutely brilliant <a href="https://github.com/unitedstates/congress-legislators">unitedstates/congress-legislators</a> repository (which just accepted <a href="https://github.com/unitedstates/congress-legislators/pull/819">my first PR</a>!)</p>
<p>This was my first attempt at writing end-user facing documentation for a personal project, and it turned out to have the same effect as writing developer documentation: the moment you try to describe how to use a feature the flaws in how that feature works from a usability perspective become strikingly evident!</p>
<p>I'm convinced that writing comprehensive documentation is a massively underrated technique for better software design.</p>

  <p>I think I’ve come up with a novel hack for the challenge of getting your company to financially support the open source projects that it uses: reach out to the maintainers and offer them generous speaking fees for remote talks to your engineering team.</p>
 The problem 
<p>Everyone agrees that open source projects deserve more financial support. Actually supporting projects can be surprisingly difficult though:</p>
 
 Many projects don’t offer any clear mechanism for sponsoring them. 
 More to the point: open source projects are often really bad at asking for or thinking about money - it’s rarely a core competency! 
 Projects that do often get the tiers wrong: a $5/month “buy a coffee” GitHub sponsorship isn’t really going to make a meaningful impact on a project. 
 But… making the case that a for-profit company should hand over money for something they’re getting for free is hard! You need a lot of buy-in from a lot of stakeholders for anything involving spending money - and many of the people who care about this within a company won’t have enough internal clout to get it to happen. 
 
<p>If you can make sponsorship happen, great: you should do that. But if not… how about reaching out to the maintainers and offering to hire them for an hour-long “consultancy” speaking engagement instead?</p>
<p>Thanks to the rise of remote working and Zoom, giving a talk no longer requires traveling to a venue - which could easily turn an hour-long opportunity into a full day.</p>
<p>One-off paid speaking opportunities are much more likely to fit into a regular company’s model of how money should spent than monthly donations.</p>
 What if they’re not experienced speakers? 
<p>The obvious flaw in this idea is that being an open source maintainer doesn’t necessarily mean that someone is a great public speaker: speaking is a skill unto itself.</p>
<p>If that’s the case, I propose running the session as a moderated Q&amp;A instead.</p>
<p>Find a member of your team with speaking experience to act as a host. Gather questions from your other engineers in advance, and share them with your guest so that they can prepare. Then run the session as a Q&amp;A.</p>
<p>This takes a huge deal of pressure off the speaker, and means you get a conversation that’s much more targeted to your team’s interests and needs as well.</p>
 So go and do it! 
<p>Remember, the key problem we’re trying to solve here is how to financially support projects and maintainers that may not be very good at asking for the money.</p>
<p>I want to take the pressure off those maintainers to learn how to market and sell their services.</p>
<p>So reach out to some projects you use and ask them if you can pay them to spend an hour of their time talking to your team! I’m excited to see how well this works.</p>
<p>Be generous: This isn't about negotiating the best speaking rate from someone who may never have been paid to speak before. This is about compensating them for the enormous value that your company has gained from their work, and using a clever accounting trick to do so. So offer them a generous fee up front! Paying over the odds should be part of your goal here.</p>
<p>For larger companies there's probably an upper cap on the amount that can be expensed easily. Finding out what that is might be helpful here too.</p>
<p>Your company likely has an existing education budget which might be a good source of funds for this kind of engagement.</p>
<p>(If your team would benefit from a talk from me about <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a>, <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/">sqlite-utils</a>, <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/">Git scraping</a> or any of the other projects I have going on, please drop me a line at <code>swillison at gmail dot com</code>. You can also <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/simonw">sponsor my work on GitHub</a>!)</p>

<p>
    In response to a recent post, my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/brittb">Britt Blaser</a> made the comment that life is a DAO. A <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/dao/">DAO, or distributed autonomous organization</a>, is a specialized form of smart contract.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Think of them like an internet-native business that's collectively owned and managed by its members. They have built-in treasuries that no one has the authority to access without the approval of the group. Decisions are governed by proposals and voting to ensure everyone in the organization has a voice.
</p>
<p>There's no CEO who can authorize spending based on their own whims and no chance of a dodgy CFO manipulating the books. Everything is out in the open and the rules around spending are baked into the DAO via its code.</p>
 From <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/dao/">Decentralized autonomous organizations</a><br>Referenced 2022-02-16T09:52:23-0700
 </blockquote>

<p>
    Metasystems have some similarities to distributed autonomous organizations, but offer someting more. Where a DAO is like a corporation, a metasystem is more like a city—with <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/geoffrey_west_the_surprising_math_of_cities_and_corporations?language=en">all that those differences imply</a>. In his <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/?p=352">epic paper on the Laws of Identity</a>, Kim Cameron identified important features that metasystems have:
</p>
 
     Encapsulating protocol— Protocols describe the rules for a set of interactions. Protocols are the foundation of interoperability and allow for scale by defining how interactions happen.  
     Unified user experience—A unified user experience doesn’t mean a single user interface. Rather the focus is on the experience. Unified user experiences let people know what to expect. As a result, they can intuitively understand how to interact in any given context.  
     User choice—By allowing people to select appropriate service providers and features a metasystem allows for autonomy, anonymity, and flexibility. No single system can anticipate all the scenarios that come up as people live their lives. A metasystem allows for context-specific scenarios to be built and can even support ad hoc interactions that no one anticipated. 
     Modular—A metasystem isn't a single, centralized system with limited pieces and parts. Rather, a metasystem has interchangeable components, built and operated by various parties. Protocols and standards enable this. Modularity is a pre-requisite for substitutability and choice, as well as interoperability. 
     Polycentric (decentralized)—Metasystems are decentralized to enable autonomy and flexibility and to support better privacy. No single system can anticipate all the various use cases. And no single actor should be allowed to determine who uses the system or for what purposes. Furthermore, decentralization gives the metasystem the ability to scale as needed.  
     Polymorphic (different data schema)—The information needed in different contexts is widely varied. The content carried by a metasystem must be flexible to support these varied interactions, including ad hoc interactions, and support user autonomy. 
 

<p>
    DAOs have some of these features, but lack or limit others. For example, most DAOs are built for specific, not ad hoc, purposes and therefore lack a flexible schema (i.e., they are not polymorphic). And while they may let people vote with different wallets, they don't usually allow other functionality to be grafted onto them to change the scenarios they can react to. In fairness, that's not what they're built for. They usually have a specific purpose, say <a href="https://www.constitutiondao.com">buying an original copy of the Constitution</a>. Metasystems are more general purpose. 
</p>

<p>
    Metasystems have other advantages. In <a>Leveraging the Identity Metasystem</a>, I discuss one: you can analyze the behavior of a metasystem once and then apply that analysis to systems built on the metasystem. This isn't true of DAOs (or any smart contract). You have to study the individual smart contract's code to understand what it does and whether it behaves like its proponents say it does. 
</p>

<p>
    There's another big advantage of metasystems: small experiments. Here, I'm thinking of the identity metasystem specifically since that's where my experience is, but I think it applies to all metasystems. Identity is foundational to almost everything we do. We don't often think about identity in the physical world because our ability to recognize, remember, react to, and interact with people, organizations, and things is innate and therefore tacit. We do it naturally, without conscious effort. Even so, it impacts every relationship and every interaction.
</p>

<p>
    Because identity is foundational to so many things, large projects inevitably have consequences that were not foreseen. For example, over the last decade, national identity projects undertaken by a government have  become more common. These projects necessarily have a huge impact on the structure of society. Aadhaar is the most conspicuous example. Aadhaar was designed as an online/offline government ID system that used federation for other services1. As a result, Aadhaar is complex and centralizes much of the interaction and data. There is much to be admired in Aadhaar including reduced fraud and increased convenience. But its <a href="https://insights.som.yale.edu/insights/what-happens-when-billion-identities-are-digitized">overarching, ubiquitous, and centralized nature, along with its reliance on biometrics, also make it a target for hacking and an avenue for abuse</a>. 
</p>

<p>
    On the other hand, an identity metasystem provides the same benefits as a federated design like Aadhaar, while increasing autonomy and reducing unintended data loss or sharing. A metasystem allows for small experiments that are tailored for a given context. For example, I've recently written <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2022/01/irs_using_facial_scanning.shtml">several</a> <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2022/02/a_defacto_national_id_from_idme.shtml">times</a> about the IRS proposal to use ID.me as their exclusive solution for authentication2. I've said that SSI and verifiable credentials offer a better solution. Several people asked me how this might work. 
</p>

<p>
    Suppose that Congress passed a new digital <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/real-id">Real ID</a> act that set standards for state digital IDs (driver's license or ID cards) that were issued as verifiable credentials on the identity metasystem. The original Real ID Act sets minimum identity proofing standards (among other things) for state DMVs. If your driver's license has a gold star on it, then it's Real ID compliant. By applying those same criteria to verifiable credentials that are equivalent to a physical driver's license, the verifiable credential now also becomes usable for flying and use with government agencies for identification. Further, because they're built on a modular identity metasystem, Real Digital IDs don't lock people into proprietary apps or place private entities as the intermediaries for every identity transaction. 
</p>

<p>
    This is a small experiment because rather than creating an entirely new digital identity system, it builds on all the infrastructure that's already in place for proofing identities in a trustworthy way, to create a digital version of something people already understand. And it enables further small experiments by others. Now the IRS can start using Real Digital IDs without contracting with or paying a company like ID.me to do the proofing. They don't have to analyze technical risks because the metasystem allows the risks to be evaluated once. Others, in or out of government, can now accept or not accept the Real Digital ID as their context dictates. Many small experiments, some successful, others not, happen because the metasystem is decentralized, flexible, and scalable. 
</p>

<p>
    After thinking it through, I decided that Britt is almost right. Rather than being a DAO, the world is a gigantic metasystem that provides numerous tacit capabilities for action and interaction. So, while "Life is a DAO" makes a better t-shirt, I prefer "Life is a Metasystem." Take the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_pill_and_blue_pill">red pill</a>.

    Ethics, maturity and incentives may not appear obvious or natural bedfellows.&nbsp; However, if someone else’s incentives drive you, you are likely on a journey from immaturity to Peak Paradox.&nbsp; A road from Peak Paradox towards a purpose looks like maturity as your own incentives drive you. Of note, ethics change depending on the direction of travel.&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>----</p><p>In psychology, maturity can be operationally defined as the level of psychological functioning one can attain, after which the level of psychological functioning no longer increases with age.&nbsp; Maturity is the state, fact, or period of being mature.</p><p>Whilst immature is not fully developed or has an emotional or intellectual development appropriate to someone younger, I want to use the state of immaturity, which is the state where one is not fully mature.&nbsp;</p><p>Incentives are a thing that motivates or encourages someone to do something.</p><p>Peak Paradox is where you try to optimise for everything but cannot achieve anything as you do not know what drives you and are constantly conflicted.&nbsp;</p><p>Ethics is a branch of philosophy that "involves systematising, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong behaviour".&nbsp; Ethical and moral principles govern a person's behaviour.</p><br><p>The Peak Paradox framework is below.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br><p>When we start our life journey, we travel from being immature to mature.&nbsp; Depending on your context, e.g. location, economics, social, political and legal, you will naturally be associated with one of the four Peak Purposes. It might not be extreme, but you will be framed towards one of them (bias).&nbsp; This is the context you are in before determining your own purpose, mission or vision.&nbsp; Being born in a place with little food and water, there is a natural affinity to survival.&nbsp; Being born in a community that values everyone and everything, you will naturally align to a big society.&nbsp; Born to the family of a senior leader in a global industry, you will be framed to a particular model.&nbsp; Being a child of Murdoch, Musk, Zuckerberg, Trump, Putin, Rothschild, Gates,&nbsp; etc. - requires assimilation to a set of beliefs.&nbsp;</p><p>Children of celebrities break from what the parents thinking, as have we and as do our children.&nbsp; Politics and religious chats with teenagers are always enlightening. As children, we travel from the contextual purpose we are born into and typically head towards reaching Peak Paradox - on this journey, we are immature. (note, it is possible to go the other way and become more extreme in purpose than your parents.)&nbsp; Later in life and with the benefits of maturity, we observe this journey from the simplicity of binary choices (black and white ethics) towards a more nuanced mess at Peak Paradox. At Peak Paradox, we sense a struggle to make sense of the different optimisations, drivers, purposes, incentives, rewards that others have.&nbsp; This creates anxiety, tension and conflict within us. During this journey from a given purpose to Peak Paradox, the incentives given to you are designed to maintain the original purpose, to keep you following that ideal.&nbsp; Incentive frame and keep us in a model which is sometimes hard to break.</p><p></p><p>It is only when we live with complexity and are able to appreciate others' purposes, optimisations, and drivers that we will also gain clarity on our own passion, purpose or mission. By living with Peak Paradox, we change from being driven by others' incentives to uncovering our own affinity; this is where we start to align to what we naturally believe in and find what fits our skin.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>I have written before that we have to move from <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/post/questions-to-help-frame-your-own-paradoxes">Peak Paradox towards a purpose if we want to have clarity of purpose and achieve something</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Enter Ethics</p><p>Suppose maturity is the transition from our actions being determined by others and following their ethical or moral code to determining what type of world or society we want to be part of. In that case, we need to think about the two journeys.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>On the route from birth to Peak Paradox, I have framed this as a route from immaturity to living with complexity.&nbsp; On the route in, we live by others' moral and ethical codes and are driven by their incentives. &nbsp; As we leave Peak Paradox and head to a place where we find less tension, conflicts and anxiety, which has a natural affinity to what we believe, and we create our own moral and ethical compass/ code and become driven by our own motivations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We should take a fresh perspective on ethics and first determine which direction someone is heading before we make a judgement.&nbsp; This is increasingly important in #cyberethics and #digitalethics as we only see the point and have no ability to create a bearing or direction.</p><p>The purpose of Peak Paradox</p><p>As maturity heads towards being mature, we move in and out of living at Peak Paradox from different “Purposes” I am sure this is an iterative process.&nbsp; The purpose of Peak Paradox is to be in a place where you are comfortable with complexity, but it is not a place to stay. It is like a holiday home, good to go there now and again, but it does not represent life.&nbsp; The question we have is how do we know when we are at Peak Paradox, probably because our <a href="https://opengovernance.net/how-do-you-recognise-when-your-north-star-has-become-a-black-hole-c3f0a759fb5">north star has become a black hole</a>!&nbsp; The key message here is that some never escape the Peak Paradox black hole, finding they live in turmoil driven by others' incentives that are designed to keep you there) and never finding their own passion, incentive or motivation.&nbsp; The complexity death vortex is where you endlessly search for a never reachable explanation of everything as it is all too interconnected and interdependent to unravel. Leaders come out from Peak Paradox knowing why they have a purpose and a direction.&nbsp;</p><p>The Journey</p><p>Imagine you are born into a celebrity household, over time you see the world is more complicated,&nbsp; you work for a company believing that money bonuses and incentives matter.&nbsp; Over time you come to understand the tensions such a narrow view brings.&nbsp; You search for something better, committing to living a simpler life, changing your ethics and moral code.&nbsp; This still creates tension, and you search for peace and harmony, where you find less tension and more alignment; when you arrive there, you have a unique code because you live with complexity and understand different optimisations.&nbsp; It does not scale, and few can grasp your message.</p><p></p><br><p>Where are you on the journey?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><br><br>

<p>A new draft of the OAuth 2.0 Demonstration of Proof-of-Possession at the Application Layer (DPoP) specification has been published that addresses four months’ worth of great review comments from the working group.  Refinements made were:</p>
 
 Added Authorization Code binding via the <code>dpop_jkt</code> parameter. 
 Described the authorization code reuse attack and how <code>dpop_jkt</code> mitigates it. 
 Enhanced description of DPoP proof expiration checking. 
 Described nonce storage requirements and how nonce mismatches and missing nonces are self-correcting. 
 Specified the use of the <code>use_dpop_nonce</code> error for missing and mismatched nonce values. 
 Specified that authorization servers use <code>400</code> (Bad Request) errors to supply nonces and resource servers use <code>401</code> (Unauthorized) errors to do so. 
 Added a bit more about <code>ath</code> and pre-generated proofs to the security considerations. 
 Mentioned confirming the DPoP binding of the access token in the list in (#checking). 
 Added the <code>always_uses_dpop</code> client registration metadata parameter. 
 Described the relationship between DPoP and Pushed Authorization Requests (PAR). 
 Updated references for drafts that are now RFCs. 
 
<p>I believe this brings us much closer to a final version.</p>

<p>This article shows how to implement authorization in an ASP.NET Core Blazor application using Azure AD security groups as the data source for the authorization definitions. Policies and claims are used in the application which decouples the descriptions from the Azure AD security groups and the application specific authorization requirements. With this setup, it is easy to support any complex authorization requirement and IT admins can manager the accounts independently in Azure. This solution will work for Azure AD B2C or can easily be adapted to use data from your database instead of Azure AD security groups if required.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/AzureADAuthRazorUiServiceApiCertificate/tree/main/BlazorBff">https://github.com/damienbod/AzureADAuthRazorUiServiceApiCertificate/tree/main/BlazorBff</a></p>



<p>Setup the AAD security groups</p>



<p>Before we start using the Azure AD security groups, the groups need to be created. I use Powershell to create the security groups. This is really simple using the Powershell AZ module with AD. For this demo, just two groups are created, one for users and one for admins. The script can be run from your Powershell console. You are required to authenticate before running the script and the groups are added if you have the rights. In DevOps, you could use a managed identity and the client credentials flow. </p>


  # https://theitbros.com/install-azure-powershell/
#
# https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/az.accounts/connect-azaccount?view=azps-7.1.0
# 
# Connect-AzAccount -Tenant "--tenantId--"
# AZ LOGIN --tenant "--tenantId--"

$tenantId = "--tenantId--"
$gpAdmins = "demo-admins"
$gpUsers = "demo-users"

function testParams {

	if (!$tenantId) 
	{ 
		Write-Host "tenantId is null"
		exit 1
	}
}

testParams

function CreateGroup([string]$name) {
    Write-Host " - Create new group"
    $group = az ad group create --display-name $name --mail-nickname $name

    $gpObjectId = ($group | ConvertFrom-Json).objectId
    Write-Host " $gpObjectId $name"
}

Write-Host "Creating groups"

##################################
### Create groups
##################################

CreateGroup $gpAdmins
CreateGroup $gpUsers

#az ad group list --display-name $groupName

return
  


<p>Once created, the new security groups should be visible in the Azure portal. You need to add group members or user members to the groups.</p>







<p>That’s all the configuration required to setup the security groups. Now the groups can be used in the applications.</p>



<p>Define the authorization policies</p>



<p>We do not use the security groups directly in the applications because this can change a lot or maybe the application is deployed to different host environments. The security groups are really just descriptions about the identity. How you use this, is application specific and depends on the solution business requirements which tend to change a lot. In the applications, shared authorization policies are defined and only used in the Blazor WASM and the Blazor server part. The definitions have nothing to do with the security groups, the groups get mapped to application claims. A Policies class definition was created for all the policies in the shared Blazor project because this is defined once, but used in the server project and the client project. The code was built based on the excellent <a href="https://chrissainty.com/securing-your-blazor-apps-configuring-policy-based-authorization-with-blazor/">blog</a> from Chris Sainty. The claims definition for the authorization check have nothing to do with the Azure security groups, this logic is application specific and sometimes the applications need to apply different authorization logic how the security groups are used in different applications inside the same solution.</p>


  using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;

namespace BlazorAzureADWithApis.Shared.Authorization
{
    public static class Policies
    {
        public const string DemoAdminsIdentifier = "demo-admins";
        public const string DemoAdminsValue = "1";

        public const string DemoUsersIdentifier = "demo-users";
        public const string DemoUsersValue = "1";

        public static AuthorizationPolicy DemoAdminsPolicy()
        {
            return new AuthorizationPolicyBuilder()
                .RequireAuthenticatedUser()
                .RequireClaim(DemoAdminsIdentifier, DemoAdminsValue)
                .Build();
        }

        public static AuthorizationPolicy DemoUsersPolicy()
        {
            return new AuthorizationPolicyBuilder()
                .RequireAuthenticatedUser()
                .RequireClaim(DemoUsersIdentifier, DemoUsersValue)
                .Build();
        }
    }
}
  


<p>Add the authorization to the WASM and the server project</p>



<p>The policy definitions can now be added to the Blazor Server project and the Blazor WASM project. The AddAuthorization extension method is used to add the authorization to the Blazor server. The policy names can be anything you want.</p>


  services.AddAuthorization(options =&gt;
{
   // By default, all incoming requests will be authorized according to the default policy
   options.FallbackPolicy = options.DefaultPolicy;
   options.AddPolicy("DemoAdmins", Policies.DemoAdminsPolicy());
   options.AddPolicy("DemoUsers", Policies.DemoUsersPolicy());
});
  


<p>The AddAuthorizationCore method is used to add the authorization policies to the Blazor WASM client project.</p>


  var builder = WebAssemblyHostBuilder.CreateDefault(args);
builder.Services.AddOptions();
builder.Services.AddAuthorizationCore(options =&gt;
{
	options.AddPolicy("DemoAdmins", Policies.DemoAdminsPolicy());
	options.AddPolicy("DemoUsers", Policies.DemoUsersPolicy());
});
  


<p>Now the application policies, claims are defined. Next job is to connect the Azure security definitions to the application authorization claims used for the authorization policies.</p>



<p>Link the security groups from Azure to the app authorization</p>



<p>This can be done using the IClaimsTransformation interface which gets called after a successful authentication. An application Microsoft Graph client is used to request the Azure AD security groups. The IDs of the Azure security groups are mapped to the application claims. Any logic can be added here which is application specific. If a hierarchical authorization system is required, this could be mapped here. </p>


  public class GraphApiClaimsTransformation : IClaimsTransformation
{
	private readonly MsGraphApplicationService _msGraphApplicationService;

	public GraphApiClaimsTransformation(MsGraphApplicationService msGraphApplicationService)
	{
		_msGraphApplicationService = msGraphApplicationService;
	}

	public async Task&lt;ClaimsPrincipal&gt; TransformAsync(ClaimsPrincipal principal)
	{
		ClaimsIdentity claimsIdentity = new();
		var groupClaimType = "group";
		if (!principal.HasClaim(claim =&gt; claim.Type == groupClaimType))
		{
			var objectidentifierClaimType = "http://schemas.microsoft.com/identity/claims/objectidentifier";
			var objectIdentifier = principal
				.Claims.FirstOrDefault(t =&gt; t.Type == objectidentifierClaimType);

			var groupIds = await _msGraphApplicationService
				.GetGraphUserMemberGroups(objectIdentifier.Value);

			foreach (var groupId in groupIds.ToList())
			{
				var claim = GetGroupClaim(groupId);
				if (claim != null) claimsIdentity.AddClaim(claim);
			}
		}

		principal.AddIdentity(claimsIdentity);
		return principal;
	}

    private Claim GetGroupClaim(string groupId)
	{
		Dictionary&lt;string, Claim&gt; mappings = new Dictionary&lt;string, Claim&gt;() {
			{ "1d9fba7e-b98a-45ec-b576-7ee77366cf10",
				new Claim(Policies.DemoUsersIdentifier, Policies.DemoUsersValue)},

			{ "be30f1dd-39c9-457b-ab22-55f5b67fb566",
				new Claim(Policies.DemoAdminsIdentifier, Policies.DemoAdminsValue)},
		};

		if (mappings.ContainsKey(groupId))
		{
			return mappings[groupId];
		}

		return null;
	}
}
  


<p>The MsGraphApplicationService class is used to implement the Microsoft Graph requests. This uses application permissions with a ClientSecretCredential. I use secrets which are read from an Azure Key vault. You need to implement rotation for this or make it last forever and update the secrets in the DevOps builds every time you deploy. My secrets are only defined in Azure and used from the Azure Key Vault. You could use certificates but this adds no extra security unless you need to use the secret/certificate outside of Azure or in app settings somewhere. The GetMemberGroups method is used to get the groups for the authenticated user using the object identifier.</p>


  public class MsGraphApplicationService
{
	private readonly IConfiguration _configuration;

	public MsGraphApplicationService(IConfiguration configuration)
	{
		_configuration = configuration;
	}

	public async Task&lt;IUserAppRoleAssignmentsCollectionPage&gt; 
		GetGraphUserAppRoles(string objectIdentifier)
	{
		var graphServiceClient = GetGraphClient();

		return await graphServiceClient.Users[objectIdentifier]
				.AppRoleAssignments
				.Request()
				.GetAsync();
	}

	public async Task&lt;IDirectoryObjectGetMemberGroupsCollectionPage&gt; 
		GetGraphUserMemberGroups(string objectIdentifier)
	{
		var securityEnabledOnly = true;

		var graphServiceClient = GetGraphClient();

		return await graphServiceClient.Users[objectIdentifier]
			.GetMemberGroups(securityEnabledOnly)
			.Request().PostAsync();
	}

	private GraphServiceClient GetGraphClient()
	{
		string[] scopes = new[] { "https://graph.microsoft.com/.default" };
		var tenantId = _configuration["AzureAd:TenantId"];

		// Values from app registration
		var clientId = _configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("AzureAd:ClientId");
		var clientSecret = _configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("AzureAd:ClientSecret");

		var options = new TokenCredentialOptions
		{
			AuthorityHost = AzureAuthorityHosts.AzurePublicCloud
		};

		// https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.identity.clientsecretcredential
		var clientSecretCredential = new ClientSecretCredential(
			tenantId, clientId, clientSecret, options);

		return new GraphServiceClient(clientSecretCredential, scopes);
	}
}
  


<p>The security groups are mapped to the application claims and policies. The policies can be applied in the application.</p>



<p>Use the Policies in the Server</p>



<p>The Blazor server applications implements secure APIs for the Blazor WASM. The Authorize attribute is used with the policy definition. Now the user must be authorized using our definition to get data from this API. We also use cookies because the Blazor application is secured using the BFF architecture which has improved security compared to using tokens in the untrusted SPA. </p>


  [ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
[Authorize(Policy= "DemoAdmins", 
	AuthenticationSchemes = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)]
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class DemoAdminController : ControllerBase
{
	[HttpGet]
	public IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; Get()
	{
		return new List&lt;string&gt; 
		{ 
		  "admin data", 
		  "secret admin record", 
		  "loads of admin data" 
		};
	}
}
  


<p>Use the policies in the WASM</p>



<p>The Blazor WASM application can also use the authorization policies. This is not really authorization but only usability because you cannot implement authorization in an untrusted application which you have no control of once it’s running. We would like to hide the components and menus which cannot be used, if you are not authorized. I use an AuthorizeView with a policy definition for this.</p>


  &lt;div class="@NavMenuCssClass" @onclick="ToggleNavMenu"&gt;
    &lt;ul class="nav flex-column"&gt;
        &lt;AuthorizeView Policy="DemoAdmins"&gt;
            &lt;Authorized&gt;
                 &lt;li class="nav-item px-3"&gt;
                    &lt;NavLink class="nav-link" href="demoadmin"&gt;
                        &lt;span class="oi oi-list-rich" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; DemoAdmin
                    &lt;/NavLink&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/Authorized&gt;
        &lt;/AuthorizeView&gt;

        &lt;AuthorizeView Policy="DemoUsers"&gt;
            &lt;Authorized&gt;
                 &lt;li class="nav-item px-3"&gt;
                    &lt;NavLink class="nav-link" href="demouser"&gt;
                        &lt;span class="oi oi-list-rich" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; DemoUser
                    &lt;/NavLink&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/Authorized&gt;
        &lt;/AuthorizeView&gt;

        &lt;AuthorizeView&gt;
            &lt;Authorized&gt;
                &lt;li class="nav-item px-3"&gt;
                    &lt;NavLink class="nav-link" href="graphprofile"&gt;
                        &lt;span class="oi oi-list-rich" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Graph Profile
                    &lt;/NavLink&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li class="nav-item px-3"&gt;
                    &lt;NavLink class="nav-link" href="" Match="NavLinkMatch.All"&gt;
                        &lt;span class="oi oi-home" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Home
                    &lt;/NavLink&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/Authorized&gt;
            &lt;NotAuthorized&gt;
                &lt;li class="nav-item px-3"&gt;
                    &lt;p style="color:white"&gt;Please sign in&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/NotAuthorized&gt;
        &lt;/AuthorizeView&gt;
        
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
  


<p>The Blazor UI pages should also use an Authorize attribute. This prevents an unhandled exception. You could add logic which forces you to login then with the permissions required or just display an error page. This depends on the UI strategy.</p>


  @page "/demoadmin"
@using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization
@inject IHttpClientFactory HttpClientFactory
@inject IJSRuntime JSRuntime
@attribute [Authorize(Policy ="DemoAdmins")]

&lt;h1&gt;Demo Admin&lt;/h1&gt;
  


<p>When the application is started, you will only see what you allowed to see and more important, only be able to get data for what you are authorized.</p>







<p>If you open a page where you have no access rights:</p>







<p>Notes:</p>



<p>This solution is very flexible and can work with any source of identity definitions, not just Azure security groups. I could very easily switch to a database. One problem with this, is that with a lot of authorization definitions, the size of the cookie might get to big and you would need to switch from using claims in the policies definitions to using a cache database or something. This would also be easy to adapt because the claims are only mapped in the policies and the IClaimsTransformation implementation. Only the policies are used in the application logic.</p>

<!-- use 'smarter' algorithm for cutoff snippet text
   note: summary goes first; than try content -->

   I released a new tool this week: google-drive-to-sqlite. It's a CLI utility for fetching metadata about files in your Google Drive and writing them to a local SQLite database. 
 It's pretty fun! 
 Here's how to create a SQLite database of every file you've started in your Google Drive, including both files created in Google Docs/Sheets and files you've uploaded to your drive: 
 % pip install googl

  <p>I released a new tool this week: <a href="https://datasette.io/tools/google-drive-to-sqlite">google-drive-to-sqlite</a>. It's a CLI utility for fetching metadata about files in your <a href="https://drive.google.com/">Google Drive</a> and writing them to a local SQLite database.</p>
<p>It's pretty fun!</p>
<p>Here's how to create a SQLite database of every file you've started in your Google Drive, including both files created in Google Docs/Sheets and files you've uploaded to your drive:</p>
 <code>% pip install google-drive-to-sqlite
% google-drive-to-sqlite auth
Visit the following URL to authenticate with Google Drive

https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth?access_type=offline&amp;...

Then return here and paste in the resulting code:
Paste code here: 
# Authentication is now complete, so run:
% google-drive-to-sqlite files starred.db --starred
% ls -lah starred.db
-rw-r--r--@ 1 simon  staff    40K Feb 20 14:14 starred.db
</code> 
<p>The OAuth client ID it is using hasn't been verified by Google yet, which I think means that only the first 100 people to use it will be able to authenticate. If you need to you can work around that by creating your own client ID, as <a href="https://datasette.io/tools/google-drive-to-sqlite#user-content-authentication">described in the README</a>.</p>
<p>Having created that <code>starred.db</code> file you can explore the resulting database using <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a> or <a href="https://datasette.io/desktop">Datasette Desktop</a>:</p>
 <code>datasette starred.db

# or if you have the Datasette Desktop macOS app installed:
open starred.db
</code> 
<p>Here's Datasette running against one of my larger metadata collections:</p>
<p></p>
 Why build this? 
<p>I recently got involved with a participatory journalism project, where a team of reporters have used FOIA requests to gather a huge corpus of thousands of files. The files are in a complex folder hierarchy a Google Drive. I wanted to start getting a feel for what's in there.</p>
<p>Pulling the metadata - file names, sizes, file types, file owners, creation dates - into a SQLite database felt like a great way to start understanding the size and scope of what had been collected so far.</p>
<p>Outside of that project, there's something very exciting to me about being able to use Google Drive to collate all kinds of different data and then tie it into the larger Datasette and <a href="https://dogsheep.github.io/">Dogsheep</a> ecosystems. I think there's a lot of potential here for all kinds of interesting projects.</p>
 How it works 
<p>The tool is written in Python using <a href="https://click.palletsprojects.com/">Click</a> (based on my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/click-app">click-app template</a>) and <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/">sqlite-utils</a>. It works by calling the <a href="https://developers.google.com/drive/api">Google Drive API</a>.</p>
<p>The <code>auth</code> command needs to get hold of an OAuth access token scoped to make read-only calls to the user's Google Drive contents.</p>
<p>This took a bit of figuring out. I wrote up what I learned in this TIL: <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/googlecloud/google-oauth-cli-application">Google OAuth for a CLI application</a></p>
<p>Notably, the end result of that flow is a JSON response containing both an <code>access_token</code> and a <code>refresh_token</code>.</p>
<p>The access token can be used to make authenticated API calls, but it expires after an hour and that expiration cannot be extended.</p>
<p>The refresh token lasts forever, and can be used at any time to obtain a fresh access token.</p>
<p>So the <code>auth</code> command writes the refresh token to a file called <code>auth.json</code>, then future calls to other commands use that token to retrieve a fresh access token on every run.</p>
<p>The most useful command is <a href="https://datasette.io/tools/google-drive-to-sqlite#user-content-google-drive-to-sqlite-files">google-drive-to-sqlite files</a>, which retrieves file metadata based on various criteria, then either writes that to a SQLite database or dumps it out as JSON or newline-delimited JSON. It does this by paginating through results from the Google Drive <a href="https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/reference/files/list">files list API</a>.</p>
<p>The <code>files --folder ID</code> option is a special case. It retrieves every nested file and subfolder starting at the specified folder. The Google Drive API doesn't support this operation directly, so the tool instead has to recursively call directory listings on every folder until it has pulled back all of the data. See my TIL <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/googlecloud/recursive-fetch-google-drive">Recursively fetching metadata for all files in a Google Drive folder</a> for more details.</p>
<p>This operation took over an hour for the largest folder I tested it against! So long that the access token it was using expired and I had to <a href="https://github.com/simonw/google-drive-to-sqlite/issues/11">implement code</a> to refresh the token in the middle of the operation.</p>
 Some other neat tricks 
<p>The <a href="https://datasette.io/tools/google-drive-to-sqlite#user-content-google-drive-to-sqlite-download-file_id">download command</a> downloads the specified file to disk:</p>
 <code>google-drive-to-sqlite download \
  0B32uDVNZfiEKLUtIT1gzYWN2NDI4SzVQYTFWWWxCWUtvVGNB
</code> 
<p>It detects the file type and uses that as the extension - in the above example, it saves the file as <code>0B32uDVNZfiEKLUtIT1gzYWN2NDI4SzVQYTFWWWxCWUtvVGNB.pdf</code>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://datasette.io/tools/google-drive-to-sqlite#user-content-google-drive-to-sqlite-export-format-file_id">export command</a> only works against the file IDs for docs, sheets and presentations create using Google Apps. It can export to a variety of different formats:</p>
 <code>google-drive-to-sqlite export html \
  10BOHGDUYa7lBjUSo26YFCHTpgEmtXabdVFaopCTh1vU
</code> 
<p>This writes to <code>10BOHGDUYa7lBjUSo26YFCHTpgEmtXabdVFaopCTh1vU-export.html</code>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://datasette.io/tools/google-drive-to-sqlite#user-content-google-drive-to-sqlite-get-url">get command</a> takes a URL to a Google Drive API endpoint and fetches it using a valid access token. This is a great tool for debugging and API exploration - my <code>github-to-sqlite</code> tool <a href="https://datasette.io/tools/github-to-sqlite#user-content-making-authenticated-api-calls">has this too</a>.</p>
 <code>google-drive-to-sqlite get 'https://www.googleapis.com/drive/v3/about?fields=*'
</code> 
<p>It also knows how to paginate! Adding <code>--paginate files</code> will cause it to fetch all of the subsequent pages of the API and return just the items from the <code>"files"</code> key combined into a single JSON array, for example:</p>
 <code>google-drive-to-sqlite get \
  https://www.googleapis.com/drive/v3/files \
  --paginate files
</code> 
 Exploring other APIs with the same tools 
<p>While I was building this, I realized that with just a little extra work the auth and get commands could be used to explore other Google APIs too.</p>
<p>If you are a developer, you can create your own OAuth credentials and enable access to other APIs using <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials">the Google Cloud console</a>. You can then take the resulting client ID and secret, pick a scope and run the following:</p>
 <code>google-drive-to-sqlite auth -a calendar-auth.json \
  --scope 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly' \
  --google-client-id '184325416553-nu5ci563v36rmj9opdl7mah786anbkrq.apps.googleusercontent.com' \
  --google-client-secret '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'
</code> 
<p><code>calendar-auth.json</code> will now be a JSON file that looks something like this:</p>
  {
  "google-drive-to-sqlite": {
    "refresh_token": "1//...",
    "google_client_id": "184325416553-nu5ci563v36rmj9opdl7mah786anbkrq.apps.googleusercontent.com",
    "google_client_secret": "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",
    "scope": "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly"
  }
}  
<p>You can now fetch your Google Calendar items by adding your email address to the following:</p>
 <code>google-drive-to-sqlite get \
  https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3/calendars/...@gmail.com/events \
  --auth calendar-auth.json
</code> 
<p>This will output JSON to the console. For newline-delimited JSON, add <code>--nl</code>.</p>
<p>Since we can paginate with <code>--paginate items</code>, this means we can pipe the results to <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/cli-reference.html#insert">sqlite-utils insert</a> and create a SQLite database of our calendar items!</p>
 <code>google-drive-to-sqlite get \
  https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3/calendars/...@gmail.com/events \
  --auth calendar-auth.json \
  --paginate items --nl \
  | sqlite-utils insert calendar.db events \
    - --pk id --nl --alter --replace
</code> 
<p>Maybe <code>google-drive-to-sqlite</code> wasn't the right name for this after all!</p>
 What's next? 
<p>Google severely <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/enhancing-security-controls-for-google-drive-third-party-apps">tightened their policies</a> on apps that can access Google Drive a few years ago. I'm currently waiting to see if my app will make it through their verification process, see <a href="https://github.com/simonw/google-drive-to-sqlite/issues/15">issue #15</a>.</p>
<p>If it doesn't the tool will still be usable, but users will have to jump through some extra hoops to set up their own client ID. I don't see this as a huge concern.</p>
<p>I've started thinking about ways to import additional data from the Google Drive APIs. I'm particularly interested in the idea of creating a full-text search index in SQLite based on plain text exports of documents created in Google Docs, see <a href="https://github.com/simonw/google-drive-to-sqlite/issues/28">issue #28</a>.</p>
<p>For other short-term future plans, take a look at the project's <a href="https://github.com/simonw/google-drive-to-sqlite/issues">open issues</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>These are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_evaporation_pond">salt evaporation ponds</a> on the shores of San Francisco Bay, filled with slowly evaporating salt water impounded within levees in former tidelands. There are many of these ponds surrounding the South Bay.</p>
<p>A series microscopic life forms of different kinds and colors predominate to in series as the water evaporates. First comes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_algae">green algae</a>. Next&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brine_shrimp">brine shrimp</a> predominate, turning the pond orange. Next,&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunaliella_salina">dunaliella salina</a>, a micro-algae containing high amounts of beta-carotene (itself with high commercial value), predominates, turning the water red. Other organisms can also change the hue of each pond. The full range of colors include red, green, orange and yellow, brown and blue. Finally, when the water is evaporated, the white of salt alone remains. This is harvested with machines, and the process repeats.</p></blockquote>
<p>Given the popularity of that photo and others I’ve shot like it (see <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:2009-10_31_BOS-SFO_398_(4096329287).jpg">here</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/search?newwindow=1&amp;sxsrf=APq-WBsEYQuqEkyvlZjrsy1A5o4y2-6vAg:1645282067342&amp;source=univ&amp;tbm=isch&amp;q=photo+by+doc+searls+salt">here</a>), I’ve wanted to make a large print of it to mount and hang somewhere. But there’s a problem: the photo was shot with a 2005-vintage&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_EOS_30D">Canon 30D</a>, an 8.2 megapixel SLR with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APS-C">APS-C</a>&nbsp;(less than full frame) sensor, and an aftermarket zoom lens. It’s also a JPEG shot, which means it shows compression artifacts when you look closely or enlarge it a lot. To illustrate the problem, here’s a close-up of one section of the photo:</p>
<p></p>
<p>See how grainy and full of artifacts that is? Also not especially sharp. So that was an enlargement deal breaker.</p>
<p>Until today, that is, when my friend <a href="https://mariancrostic.com/">Marian Crostic</a>, a fine art photographer who often prints large pieces, told me about <a href="https://www.topazlabs.com/">Topaz Labs</a>‘ <a href="https://www.topazlabs.com/gigapixel-ai">Gigapixel AI</a>. I’ve tried image enhancing software before with mixed results, but on Marian’s word and an $80 price, I decided to give this one a whack. Here’s the result:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Color me impressed enough to think it’s worth sharing.</p>

  <p>Summary: Self-sovereign identity must be the foundation of Web3 because it is the means for framing ourselves in the digital world and taking action with our peers.</p>



	<a></a>
	Satin Bower bird frames himself to appeal to potential mates


<p>
    I continue to work on how to describe and explain digital embodiment and it's importance in creating our future digital world. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B08BT3RFGP/windleyofente-20">The Stack</a> (Chapter 18), Benjamin Bratton talks about borders, framing, and sovereignty. He quotes <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B009NY3JZW/windleyofente-20">Elizabeth Grosz who says</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The earth can be infinitely divided, territorialized, framed. ... Framing is how chaos becomes territory. Framing is the means by which objects are delimited, qualities unleashed and art is made possible.</p>
    <p>[The frame] is the particular contribution of architecture to the taming of the virtual, the territorialization of the uncontrollable forces of the Earth. It is the frame that ... liberates the qualities of objects or event that come to constitute the substance, the matter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
    The web is divided, territorialized, and framed by servers that companies run to define their territory. We move from territory to territory throughout our day without ever being citizens of any of them. The tools people have to participate in these territories, browsers and password managers, let us visit those territories, but we ourselves cannot be visited. We cannot act. Online relationships (client-server) are inherently asymmetric and the power accrues to those who define the territory. 
</p>

<p>
    Long ago, I wrote about the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2016/10/on_sovereignty.shtml">relationship between sovereignty and borders</a>. Sovereignty depends on the border and is defined by it. Sovereignty isn't absolute control everywhere, but rather exists within a border, a frame to use Grosz's word. Drawing a boundary is placemaking—a gesture of geography according to Bratton. I love that image: self-sovereignty is about staking our territory and making a place where we can exist. Sovereignty is how we create a home in the digital world.  
</p>

<p>
    But it really goes beyond just framing—drawing a boundary. Later in that same chapter, Bratton moves from frames and borders to skin. Not only is skin the body's border or boundary, it's also a sensory organ. Says Bratton:
</p>
<blockquote>
    Skin, after all, is the largest sensory organ of any animal body, composed of multiple dermal and epidermal layers holding organs together and mediating multiple layers of individual interiority and exteriority.
</blockquote>

<p>
    This idea that we have an interior and exterior is essential to our sense of self—our self-perceived identity.  Because we have no digital skin (unlike, say, Amazon) we have no way to frame ourselves. We are like ghosts whose boundary between the internal and external is permeable and ill-defined. And unable to sense, we are unable to take action. 
</p>

<p>
    To achieve digital embodiment we not only need a way to distinguish between the interior, where we have autonomy, and the exterior, where were must relate to others as peers, but we must be able to sense at that boundary and then use that information to take action. Self sovereignty is more than a concept. Self sovereignty requires tooling that allows sensing and acting.
</p>

<p>
    The tools necessary to sense and act start with self-sovereign identity (SSI). We often talk about SSI wallets without discussing agents. SSI infrastructure requires both. Wallets hold and manage keys. But agents take action. Wallets and agents <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/11/operationalizing_digital_relationships.shtml">enable us to operationalize our digital relationships</a>. They embody us in the digital realm. They not only create the boundary that defines our personal digital territory, but also provide the means to take action so we can interact with our peers.
</p>


	<a></a>
	Relationships and Interactions in an SSI Network (click to enlarge)


<p>
    Self-sovereign identity implies autonomy and inalienability. If our identity is inalienable, then it's not transferable to another and not capable of being taken away or denied. To be inalienable is to be sovereign: to exercise supreme authority over one's personal sphere. Administrative identifiers—what others choose to call us—are alienable. Relationships are alienable. Many attributes are alienable. Who we are, and our right to choose how we present ourselves to the world, is not alienable. The distinction between the inalienable and the alienable, the self-sovereign and the administrative, is essential. Without this distinction, we are constantly at the mercy of the various administrative regimes we interact with.
</p>

<p>
    An SSI wallet and agent can provide a foundation for a self-sovereign digital existence by allowing us to frame ourselves. As I wrote last week, this, <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2022/02/web3_self-sovereign_authority_and_self-certifying_protocols.shtml">combined with self-certifying protocols</a> is the basis for a Web3 that embodies people so they can act as full-fledged participants in the digital realm.

I am writing about becoming lost on a journey as I emerge from working from home, travel restrictions, lockdowns and masks; to find nothing has changed, but everything has changed.</p><p>The hope of a shake or wake up call from something so dramatic as a global pandemic is immediately lost as we re-focus on how to pay for the next meal, drink, ticket, bill, rent, mortgage, school fee or luxury item. Have you become so wedded to an economic model that we cannot see that we will not get to our imagined NorthStar?</p><p>I feel right now that I have gone into a culdesac and cannot find the exit. The road I was following had a shortcut, but my journey planner had a shortcut that assumed I was walking and could hop over the gate onto the public path and not the reality that I was in my car.</p><p>I wrote about “<a href="https://opengovernance.net/the-new-fatigue-what-is-this-all-about-d718a48a4653">The New Fatigue — what is this all about</a>?” back in Feb 2021. I could not pinpoint how I was productive, maintained fitness, and ate well, but something was missing — human contact and social and chemistry-based interactions. I posted a view about the<a href="https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/2020/09/describing-our-response-to-covid.html"> 7 B’s and how we were responding to a global pandemic</a>; we lost #belonging. I wrote more on this under a post about<a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/post/isolation-the-8th-deadly-sin"> Isolation — the 8th deadly sin</a>.</p><p>Where am I going with this? Because we want a radical change masked as a “<a href="https://opengovernance.net/lockdown-one-year-in-and-i-now-question-what-is-a-better-normal-9c01790a0860">New Normal, something better</a>”, but we are already finding nothing has actually changed on the journey we have been on, and I am now questioning that the bright north star I had lost its sparkle!</p><p>I have used heuristics and rules to help me for the longest time; anyone on the neuro-diverse spectrum has to have them because without them surviving becomes exhausting. However, these shortcuts (when created and learnt) also mean I stopped questioning why. Now that the very fabric that set up my heuristics has changed, those rules don’t necessarily work or apply. We love a shortcut because it gets us out of trouble, we love the quick route because it works, we love an easy known trusted route because we don’t have to think. We use them all the time in business to prioritise. “What is the ROI on this?” In truth, we either don’t have the resources or cannot be bothered to spend the time to look in detail, so we use the blunt tool (ROI) to make a decision.</p><p>My tools don’t work (as well or at all)</p><p>I found my NorthStar with my tools. I was navigating to the north star with my tools. My tools did not tell me I was heading past a black hole that could suck me in. I am not sensing I am lost as my tools are not telling me; all the things we did pre-pandemic don’t work as well on the other side — but nothing other than feeling lost is telling me this. We have not gone back to everything working and still have not created enough solid ground to build new rules, so we are now lost, looking for a new NorthStar with tools that do not work.</p><p>Our shortcuts sucked us in and took away the concept that we need to dwell, be together, work it out, and take time. Our tools and shortcuts reduced our time frames and tricked us into thinking they would work forever. The great quote from Anthony Zhou below assumes you know where you are going. That is not true.</p><p>How do I recognise that my north star has become a black hole because my shortcuts and rules no longer work, creating fatigue I cannot describe, and I feel lost? There is a concept of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring_%28cognitive_bias%29"> anchor points</a> in philosophy, and it is a cognitive bias. When you lose your anchor in a harbour, you drift (ignoring sea anchors for those who sail). The same can be said when you lose your own personal anchor points that have provided the grounding for your decision making. Routines and experience are not anchor points. But the pandemic looks to have cut the ties we had to anchor points, so we feel all somewhat lost and drifting. The harder we try to re-apply the old rules, the more frustrated we become that nothing works. Perhaps it is time to make some new art such that we can discover the new rules and find some new anchor points. Then, maybe I will feel less lost?</p><p><br></p>

<p>I don't know if I've ever been <a href="https://xkcd.com/356/">nerd sniped</a> so effectively (they <a href="https://twitter.com/mrkurt/status/1484609372114272261">knew what they were doing</a>).</p>
<p>This has the potential to address one of the big challenges in deploying <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a>, my open source web framework for building dynamic applications on top of SQLite.</p>
<p>Datasette currently has plenty of good answers for publishing read-only databases online - <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/publish.html#publishing-to-google-cloud-run">Cloud Run</a>, <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/publish.html#publishing-to-heroku">Heroku</a> and <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/publish.html#publishing-to-vercel">Vercel</a> are three great options. But the moment you want to <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Feb/26/weeknotes-datasette-writes/">write back</a> to that SQLite database you're in for a harder time.</p>
<p>Accepting writes requires a working read-write filesystem, and that generally means spinning up a virtual machine - and having to take responsibility for keeping a full Linux instance fed and updated. That's a much bigger commitment than deploying a container to something like Cloud Run.</p>
<p><a href="https://fly.io/docs/reference/volumes/">Fly Volumes</a> are exactly what I've been waiting for here. They provide persistent storage for Fly apps - a volume you can mount as a directory inside a containerized application that will persist data through subsequent deploys.</p>
<p>Add a free tier, and I finally have something I can point people towards when they want to try building something persistent on top of Datasette without taking on the burden of maintaining their own virtual server somewhere, or committing to spend money before they've evaluated if this is going to work for them or not.</p>
 datasette-publish-fly 
<p>I built the first version of the <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-publish-fly">datasette-publish-fly</a> plugin nearly two years ago, as a tool for publishing read-only databases to Fly in a similar way to Cloud Run or Vercel.</p>
<p>(That plugin actually broke a few months ago without me noticing due to some changes made to the <code>flyctl</code> utility that it shells out to - figuring out what had happened and wanting to avoid surprises like this in the future lead me to develop the <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Feb/2/help-scraping/">Help scraping</a> technique I described last week.)</p>
<p>This week I released <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-publish-fly/releases/tag/1.1">datasette-publish-fly 1.1</a> with the option to attach volumes to the published instances and start serving mutable, persistent SQLite databases!</p>
<p>Basic usage looks like this:</p>
  datasette publish fly \
--app my-new-fly-application \
--create-volume 1 \
--create-db my-new-db  
<p>This will create a new Fly application on your account called <code>my-new-fly-application</code>, create a 1GB volume for that application, mount the volume and then create an empty SQLite database file in that volume called <code>my-new-db.db</code>.</p>
<p>A blank database file isn't very interesting! Datasette's <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/sql_queries.html#writable-canned-queries">Writable canned queries</a> feature can be used to configure SQL queries that write to the database. Let's try that now, by creating a <code>metadata.yml</code> file containing the following:</p>
  plugins:
  # Create messages table in messages.db on startup
  datasette-init:
    messages:
      tables:
        messages:
          columns:
            id: integer
            message: text
            datetime: text
          pk: id
databases:
  messages:
    queries:
      # /messages/add_message query
      add_message:
        sql: |-
          INSERT INTO messages (
            message, datetime
          ) VALUES (
            :message, :_now_datetime_utc
          )
        write: true  
<p>Now we can run the deploy like this:</p>
  datasette publish fly \
--app messages-demo \
--create-volume 1 \
--create-db messages \
--install datasette-init \
--metadata metadata.yml  
<p>This example uses the <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-init">datasette-init</a> plugin to create the <code>messages</code> table if it doesn't exist, and configures a canned query that can insert rows into that table (using the <code>_now_datetime_utc</code> <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/sql_queries.html#magic-parameters">magic parameter</a> to populate the current datetime.)</p>
<p>Once deployed, the following URL provides a form that can be used to add messages:</p>
<p><code>https://messages-demo.fly.dev/messages/add_message</code></p>
<p></p>
<p>As a general rule though, writable databases become more interesting when you combine them with <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins">Datasette plugins</a>.</p>
 Using Fly volumes with datasette-tiddlywiki 
<p><a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-tiddlywiki">datasette-tiddlywiki</a> is a plugin that bundles a full install of <a href="https://tiddlywiki.com/">TiddlyWiki</a>, configured to use Datasette as a storage backend. I introduced this new plugin <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Dec/24/datasette-tiddlywiki/">back in December</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-tiddlywiki/releases/tag/0.2">Version 0.2</a> of the plugin, which I released yesterday, adds authentication. TiddlyWiki instances can now be viewed by anyone but can only be edited by users with the <code>edit-tiddlywiki</code> permisson, which is available to the <code>root</code> user by default and can be granted to more users using the <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/authentication.html#permissions">Datasette permissions system</a>.</p>
<p>Here's how to deploy <code>datasette-tiddlywiki</code> to Fly, with an authenticated account that can then be used to edit the wiki.</p>
<p>We're going to use the <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-auth-passwords">datasette-auth-passwords</a> plugin to authenticate users. We need to install that locally in order to generate a password:</p>
  datasette install datasette-auth-passwords  
<p>Installing this plugin adds a new command to Datasette called <code>hash-password</code> - we can use that like so:</p>
  % datasette hash-password
Password: 
Repeat for confirmation: 
pbkdf2_sha256$260000$b1ec52979ecf0c4810e3e22ea63c119e$AjaNnyuXzDXDRK/ZQjyn881J5GnVouKxI8B3DFu/C+M=  
<p>(The example hash shown here is for the password "password", so don't use it for anything!)</p>
<p>Having created that password hash, we can use it to deploy our TiddlyWiki instance.</p>
 <code># First, install datasette-publish-fly
datasette install datasette-publish-fly

# Now deploy an instance with datasette-tiddlywiki
datasette publish fly \
--app simon-tiddlywiki \
--create-volume 1 \
--create-db tiddlywiki \
--install datasette-auth-passwords \
--install datasette-tiddlywiki \
--plugin-secret datasette-auth-passwords root_password_hash 'pbkdf2_sha256$2600...'
</code> 
<p>The <code>--app</code> value here is the name of the app on Fly, which needs to be globally unique - so pick your own value here.</p>
<p>The full password hash needs to be pasted in with single quotes on that last line.</p>
<p>Running this will churn away for a little bit deploying the application:</p>
<p></p>
<p>It can take a few minutes after the script finishes running for the application to become available - Fly are working at speeding this up. If you visit it too early you may see a TLS connection error.</p>
<p>Once the application is live, the following pages will be available:</p>
 
 
<a href="https://simon-tiddlywiki.fly.dev/-/tiddlywiki">https://simon-tiddlywiki.fly.dev/-/tiddlywiki</a> - TiddlyWiki, initially in read-only mode 
 
<a href="https://simon-tiddlywiki.fly.dev/-/login">https://simon-tiddlywiki.fly.dev/-/login</a> - the login form provided by <code>datasette-auth-passwords</code> - sign in here with username <code>root</code> and the password you used to create the hash 
 
<a href="https://simon-tiddlywiki.fly.dev/">https://simon-tiddlywiki.fly.dev/</a> - the Datasette homepage 
 
<p>Sign in and visit the wiki and you'll be able to add and edit records there!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Since the plugin saves data to an underlying SQLite table, you can visit <a href="https://simon-tiddlywiki.fly.dev/tiddlywiki/tiddlers">/tiddlywiki/tiddlers</a> to see the data that has been stored.</p>
 Other plugins to try 
<p>Here are some other interesting plugins that make use of Datasette's <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/internals.html#await-db-execute-write-sql-params-none-block-true">internal methods for writing to a database</a>:</p>
 
 
<a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-write">datasette-write</a> provides a UI for executing write queries against the database 
 
<a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-upload-csvs">datasette-upload-csvs</a> adds an interface for uploading a CSV file to create a table 
 
<a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-insert">datasette-insert</a> adds a full JSON API for inserting and updating data 
 
<a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-configure-fts">datasette-configure-fts</a> can be used to configure full-text search against an existing table 
 
<a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-edit-schema">datasette-edit-schema</a> provides tools for adding, renaming and re-ordering columns 
 
<a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-saved-queries">datasette-saved-queries</a> lets users save queries to a database table 
 
<p><a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-auth-github">datasette-auth-github</a> and <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-auth-tokens">datasette-auth-tokens</a> can be used to additional ways of authenticating with an instance.</p>

<p>Using self sovereign identity (SSI), there is no standardized solutions for solving online user authentication when using verifiable credentials and verifying the identity and user. All solutions result in further compromises and result in new problems. To understand the problems, we need to understand how this works. The following diagram shows the verifiable credential (VC) relationship with Issuer, Holders (behind a software wallet) and the verifier. Trust between the actors and are you required to authenticate the user behind the wallet are key and important requirements for some systems. Verifiable credentials are not issued to a user but to a wallet representing the user.</p>







<p>Image src: Verifiable Credentials Data Model 1.0&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">specification</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Use case definition: The user must be authenticated and verified by the “verifier” application using the verifiable credential. Is the user data in the verifiable credential the same user presenting it or a user, application allowed to use the VC on behalf of that person. So how can this be solved? </p>



<p>Solution 1: User Authentication is on the wallet.</p>



<p>The wallet application implements the authentication of the user and binds the user to all credentials issued to the wallet through the agents and then sent to verifier applications. With BBS+ verifiable credentials, it is possible to do this. The wallet is responsible for authentication of the user, but this is not standardized, and no wallet does this the same. If the wallet is responsible for user authentication, then applications only need to authorize the verifiable credentials and not authenticate the user behind the wallet and represented in the verifiable credential which is connected to the wallet. The VC is invalid if a different wallet sends this. So the verifier applications only validates that the sender of the VC has possession of the credential, nothing else and trusts that the wallet authenticates the user correctly and also trusts that the wallet prevents misuse. The verifier cannot validate if the application, person using the credential is allowed to use it. The verifier must trust that the wallet does this correctly. </p>



<p>Problems with this solution:</p>



  Wallet Software monopoly: If a state body pushes this solution, then it has effectively created a monopoly for the producer of the wallet software. This is because at present with existing wallets, the required authentication is specific to the application and the definition of how this is required and the hardware device used for the wallet. No standards exist for how a user is authenticated in the wallet and what level of initial user authentication is required. This could be improved by creating a new standard for wallets which can be used by the state body and the way the wallet must authenticate the users of the wallet. Then any wallet which fulfills the standard can be used for state created verifiable credentials.  Backup and recovery of wallets becomes really complicated because the user is connected to the software wallet. If I lose my wallet, or would like to switch the wallet, a safe secure standardized way would be required proving that the wallet has authenticated the same person as the initial wallet or a person of trust. All issued credentials would probably need to be re-issued. The user of the wallet and the wallet instance are tightly coupled.  Verifier authorization only, not authentication: The verifier does not authenticate the user behind the wallet, just accepts that it was done correctly. This creates a closed system between the verifier and the wallet even though it is distributed. The verifier is tightly coupled in the relationship if blindly trusting verifiable credentials from wallets which are not in its system scope. If the verifier needs to verify the identity, then FIDO2, OIDC, OAUTH2, PKI or existing online verifying flows could be used as a second factor.   Single point of failure: if the credential issuer VCs can no longer be trusted, then all verifiers using the credentials need to revoke everything created from the VC . This is not a problem if the verifier authenticated it’s users, identities directly.  



<p>Solution 2: Use the OIDC SIOP standard to authenticate when issuing and verifying the verifiable credentials</p>



<p><a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-self-issued-v2-1_0-07.html">https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-self-issued-v2-1_0-07.html</a></p>



<p><a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0-08.html">https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0-08.html</a></p>



<p>A second way of solving user authentication in SSI is to use OpenID Connect and SIOP. The credential issuer uses it’s own OpenID Connect server with pre-registered users where the person has been correctly identified. The credential issuer is responsible for identifying and authenticating the identity, ie the user plus the application. Each credential type which is issued requires a specific OpenID Connect client. When the user, using the SIOP agent from his or her wallet tries to add a new verifiable credential using SIOP, the user is required to authenticate using the identity provider (IDP). This can also be used when verifying credentials. By using this, any wallet which supports the SIOP agent with the correct verifiable credential type used can work. The strong authentication is not required on the wallet because this is part of the flows and the user does not need to be connected to the wallet. If the verifier does not authenticate the user or application sending the verifiable credentials, then strong authentication would still be required on the wallet.</p>



<p>Problems with this solution:</p>



  Requires an OIDC server: All credential issuers require an OpenID Connect server and a separate client per credential type.  Verifier authorization only, not authentication: Only proof of possession on the verifier. Verifiers need to start an SIOP verification and the verifier needs to trust the OIDC server used for the client. The OIDC server authenticates and not the verifier.   Single point of failure: if the credential issuer VCs can no longer be trusted, then all verifiers using the credentials need to revoke everything created from the VC . This is not a problem if the verifier authenticated it’s users directly.  



<p>Solution 3: Verifiers authenticate the user correctly before trusting the verifiable credentials sent from an unspecific wallet.</p>



<p>Another way of solving this is that all credential issuers and all verifiers authenticate the user behind a verifiable credential using their own process. This avoids the single point of failure. Each sign-in would require an extra step to authenticate, if using SSI for example a FIDO2 key or a PKI authentication or some OIDC flow can be used. SSI could be used as the first factor in the application authentication. This solution works really good but a lot of the advantages of SSI is lost. </p>



<p>Problems with this solution:</p>



  All applications require authentication. This is more effort if implementing a closed system, but all applications need to do this anyway, so it’s not really a disadvantage. If you control both the issuer and the verifier, then the verifier application could just do authorization of the verifiable credential.  SSI adds little value. Due to the fact that a second authentication method is used everywhere, this would also work without SSI, so why add SSI then in the first place.  



<p>Summary</p>



<p>User authentication is not an easy problem to solve and SSI at present does not solve this in a standard way. All existing solutions do something vendor specific or solve this in a closed system. As soon as inter-op is required, then the problems begin. It is important to solve this in a way which does not require a vendor specific solution or creates a monopoly for a vendor solution. At present, SSI solutions still have very little convergence. We have different ledgers which only work with specific agents. We have different agents, SIOP, DIDComm V1, V2 which are only supported by certain wallets. We have different verifiable credentials standards which do not work together. We have no authentication standards on the wallets, no standard for backup and recovery. It is still not clear how the trust register for credentials issuers will work, I as an application verifier need an easy way to validate the quality of the credential issuer otherwise how can I know if the credential was issued in a good way without doing my own security check. Guardianship will also complicate the user authentication process. </p>

<p>In faith that nothing lasts forever, and that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University">an institution that’s been around since 1636</a> is more likely to keep something published online for longer than <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com">one that was born in 1994</a> and isn’t quite dead yet (and with full appreciation to the latter for its continued existence), I’ve decided to re-publish some of my Linux Journal columns that I hope have persistent relevance. <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/building-relationship-economy">This one</a> is from the February 2007 issue of the magazine.</p>
 
<p>Building a Relationship Economy</p>
<p>Is there something new that open source development methods and values can bring to the economy? How about something old?</p>
<p>I think the answer may come from the developing world, where pre-industrial methods and values persist and offer some helpful models and lessons for a networked world that’s less post-industrial than industrial in a new and less impersonal way.</p>
<p>This began to become apparent to me a few years ago I had a Socratic exchange with a Nigerian pastor named Sayo, whom I was lucky to find sitting next to me on a long airplane trip.</p>
<p>We were both on speaking junkets. He was coming from an event related to his latest work: translating the Bible to Yoruba, one of the eight languages he spoke. I was on my way to give a talk about&nbsp;<a href="http://cluetrain.com/">The Cluetrain Manifesto</a>, a book I co-authored.</p>
<p>My main contribution to Cluetrain was a chapter called&nbsp;<a href="http://cluetrain.com/book/markets.html">“Markets are conversations”</a>. Sayo asked me what we meant by that. After hearing my answer, he acknowledged that our observations were astute, but also incomplete. Something more was going on in markets than just transactions and conversations, he said. What was it?</p>
<p>I said I didn’t know. Here is the dialogue that followed, as close to verbatim as I can recall it…</p>
<p>“Pretend this is a garment”, Sayo said, picking up one of those blue airplane pillows. “Let’s say you see it for sale in a public market in my country, and you are interested in buying it. What is your first question to the seller?”</p>
<p>“What does it cost?” I said.</p>
<p>“Yes”, he answered. “You would ask that. Let’s say he says, ‘Fifty dollars’. What happens next?”</p>
<p>“If I want the garment, I bargain with him until we reach an agreeable price.”</p>
<p>“Good. Now let’s say you know something about textiles. And the two of you get into a long conversation where both of you learn much from each other. You learn about the origin of the garment, the yarn used, the dyes, the name of the artist, and so on. He learns about how fabric is made in your country, how distribution works, and so on. In the course of this you get to know each other. What happens to the price?”</p>
<p>“Maybe I want to pay him more and he wants to charge me less”.</p>
<p>“Yes. And why is that?”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure.”</p>
<p>“You now have a relationship”.</p>
<p>He went on to point out that, in his country, and in much of what we call the developing world, relationship is of paramount importance in public markets. Transaction still matters, of course. So does conversation. But the biggest wedge in the social pie of the public marketplace is relationship. Prices less set than found, and the context for finding prices is both conversation and relationship. In many cases, relationship is the primary concern, not price. The bottom line is not everything.</p>
<p>Transaction rules the Industrialized world. Here prices are set by those who control the manufacturing, distribution and retail systems. Customers do have an influence on prices, but only in the form of aggregate demand. The rates at which they buy or don’t buy something determines what price the “market” will bear  in a system where “market” means aggregated demand, manifested in prices paid and quantities sold. Here the whole economic system is viewed mostly through the prism of price, which is seen as the outcome of tug between supply and demand.</p>
<p>Price still matters in the developing world, Sayo said, but relationship matters more. It’s a higher context with a higher set of values, many of which are trivialized or made invisible when viewed through the prism of price. Relationship is not reducible to price, even though it may influence price. Families and friends don’t put prices on their relationships. (At least not consciously, and only at the risk of cheapening or losing a relationship.) Love, the most giving force in any relationship, is not about exchanging. It is not fungible. You don’t expect a payback or a rate of return on the love you give your child, your wife or husband, your friends.</p>
<p>Even in the industrialized world, relationship has an enormous bearing on the way markets work, Sayo said. But it is poorly understood in the developed world, where so much “comes down to the bottom line”.</p>
<p>I shared this conversation a few weeks later with&nbsp;<a href="http://esr.ibiblio.org/">Eric S. Raymond</a>, who put the matter even more simply. “All markets work at three levels”, he said. “Transactions, conversations and relationships”. Eric is an atheist. Sayo is a Christian. With those two triangulating so similarly on the same subject, I began to figure there was something more to this relationship business.</p>
<p>I began to ask questions. For example, What happens when you view markets through the prism of relationship? Why do we write free or open source code?</p>
<p>Linus says (in the title of his only&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_for_Fun">book</a>) he does it “Just for Fun”. Yes, there are practical purposes  there have to be.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s02.html">Scratching itches</a>, for example. Development communities are notoriously long on conversation (check out the&nbsp;<a href="http://lkml.org/">LKML</a>&nbsp;for starters), and on relationship as well. Not a whole lot of transaction there, either, since the code is free. Next question: Are there economies involved?</p>
<p>I think the answer is yes, and they are concentrated on the manufacturing end. We make useful code for its&nbsp;<a href="http://www.itgarage.com/node/736">“because effects”</a>. Thanks to Linux, much money will be made; but&nbsp;because&nbsp;of it, far more than&nbsp;with&nbsp;it. Just look at Google and Amazon as two obvious examples. Perhaps a billion of the world’s Websites are Apache on Linux.</p>
<p>Relationship is involved here, too. Writing code that serves as abundant and free building material is an act of generosity. Dare we say we do it for love? Certainly a lot of us love doing it.</p>
<p>Likewise with performing artists. Musicians don’t take up an instrument and develop their skills just to make money at it. They do it for love of the experience, of playing together with other musicians, of giving something to an audience, and to the world.</p>
<p>Of course, professionals like to get paid for their work too. That’s what makes them professionals.</p>
<p>What if the goods are essentially free (as in beer, air or love)? That’s the case with code, music, art, and anything else that can be digitized and copied. Many artists want or need to be paid for what they do. The question is how we get our love to fund theirs — how we can relate in ways that work financially for both the supply and the demand of essentially free stuff.</p>
<p>The entertainment industry has had an answer ever since the Net showed up. Hollywood wasn’t blind to the Net. Quite the opposite. They correctly saw the Net as a way for every device to be zero distance from every other device — and to pass identical copies of anything between anybody a cost that rounded to zero. They saw this a threat to their incumbent business model. So they came up with a way to deal with that threat: DRM, or Digital Rights Management. DRM worked by crippling recorded goods so it can’t easily be copied except by those whose rights were managed by suppliers.</p>
<p>It hasn’t worked. A few days ago Steve Jobs said so himself, in a landmark essay titled&nbsp;<a href="http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughtsonmusic/">Thoughs on Music</a>, published on February 6. It not only notes the failure of DRM, but subtly recruits customers and fellow technologists to help Apple convince the record industry that it’s best to sell music that isn’t DRM’d. He concludes, “Convincing them to license their music to Apple and others DRM-free will create a truly interoperable music marketplace. Apple will embrace this wholeheartedly”.</p>
<p>The operative verb here is “license”.</p>
<p>Let’s ignore the record companies for a minute. Instead, lets look behind them, back up the supply chain, to the first sources of music: the artists. Part of the system we need is already built for these sources, through&nbsp;<a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a>. By this system, creative sources can choose licenses that specify the freedoms carried by their work, and also specify what can and cannot be done with that work. These licenses are readable by machines as well as by lawyers. That’s a great start on the supply side.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at the same work from the demand side. What can we do — as music lovers, or as customers — to find, use, and even pay for, licensed work? Some mechanisms are there, but nothing yet that is entirely in&nbsp;our&nbsp;control — that reciprocates and engages on the demand side what Creative Commons provides on the supply side.</p>
<p>Yes, we can go to websites, subscribe to music services, use iTunes or other supply-controlled intermediating systems and deal with artists inside those systems. But there still isn’t anything that allows us to deal directly, on our own terms, with artists and their intermediaries. Put another way, we don’t yet have the personal means for establishing&nbsp;relationships&nbsp;with artists.</p>
<p>For example, I relate in some ways to&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Copeland">Stewart Copeland</a>, though he doesn’t know it. Stewart is best known as the drummer in The Police, even though the band hasn’t recorded an album since 1983 and Stewart has since then established himself as a first-rank composer of soundtracks, including “Rumble Fish”, “Talk Radio” and “Wall Street”. IMDb lists him as a composer of scores for sixty-nine movies and TV productions. You have to hit “page down” six times or more to get to the bottom of the listings. Still, much as I appreciate Stewart’s compositions, I’ve always loved his drumming. I’m not a drummer, but I’m a serviceable percussionist. (When I pick up bongos, congas, a rub-board or a tambourine, I get approving nods from the real musicians I jam with — as rarely as the occasion arises.) When the Police ceased touring and producing albums, I missed Stewart’s drumming most of all.</p>
<p>Last year I got a big charge out of hearing an&nbsp;<a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail342.html">IT Conversations podcast</a>&nbsp;interview with Stewart, though I was disappointed to hear he doesn’t drum much anymore.</p>
<p>Then I heard last week on the radio that the Police may be getting back together and touring again. I can relate to that. But how? Stewart’s&nbsp;<a href="http://www.stewartcopeland.net/">website</a>&nbsp;is one of those over-produced flash-filled things that recording an performing artists seem to think they need in order to “deliver an experience” or whatever. Nearly every internal link leads to a link-proof something-or-other in the same window, among other annoyances. To call it relationship-proof would be an inderstatement.</p>
<p>So instead let’s look at relating through the IT Conversations podcast. I say that because yesterday&nbsp;<a href="http://www.windley.com/">Phil Windley</a>, who runs IT Conversations, posted&nbsp;<a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2007/02/funding_public_radio_and_itc_with_vrm.shtml">Funding Public Radio (and ITC) with VRM</a>&nbsp;on his blog, and listed some of the things he might be looking for from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2007/02/funding_public_radio_and_itc_with_vrm.shtml">VRM</a>&nbsp;or Vendor Relationship Management. That is, from something that lives on the demand side, but can relate on mutually useful terms with the sjupply side  which in his case is IT Conversations.</p>
<p>Here’s the first answer: It can’t be limited to a browser. I want a button, or a something, on my MP3 player that allows me to relate not only to IT Conversations as an intermediary, but to the artist as well — if the artist is interested. They may not be. But I want that function supported. What we need on the user’s side is a tool, or a set of tools, that support both independence and engagement.</p>
<p>If what we’re looking for doesn’t exist, how hard will it be to build? I’m sure it won’t be easy, but it will be less hard than it was before the roster of open source tools and applications grew to six figures, which is where it stands now. And that’s not counting all the useful standards that are laying around too.</p>
<p>What do we need?</p>
<p>First, I think we need protocols. These should be modeled on the social ones we find in free and open marketplaces. They should work like the ones Sayo talked about in his Socratic dialogue with me on the airplane. They should be simple, useful and secure.</p>
<p>Second, we need ways of supporting transactions. This is a tough one, because to work they need to be low-friction. I should be able to pay IT Conversations (or any public radio station, or any podcaster) as easily as I pay for a coffee. Or better yet, as easily as I tip a barista. So PayPal won’t cut it. (Not the way I’ve experienced PayPal, anyway.)</p>
<p>Third, we need ways of selectively and securely asserting our identities, including our choice to remain anonymous. This means getting past sign-on hurdles on the Web, and past membership silos out in the physical world (such as the ones that require a special card, or whatever). Again, the friction should be as low as possible.</p>
<p>Fourth, we need ways of expressing demand that will bring supply to us. Let’s say I want to hear other interviews with Stewart Copeland. I don’t want to go through the standard Google/Yahoo text search. I want to tell the marketplace (in some cases without revealing yet exactly who I am) that I’m looking for these interviews, and then have them find me. Then I want an easy way to pay for them if I feel like it. As Sayo suggests, I might be more willing to pay something if I can relate to the source, and not just invisibly use goods produced by that source.</p>
<p>In&nbsp;<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/node/1000180">Putting the Wholes Together</a>, which I posted recently at Linux Journal, I said public broadcasting would be a good place to start — not just because public broadcasting needs to find ways to make more money from more listeners and viewers, but because payment is voluntary. Seems to me that when payment is voluntary, relationship will drive up the percentage of those who pay. It’s just a theory, but one that should be fun to test.</p>
<p>Soon as I get the time to put it together, I’ll put out a challenge for developers (that’s you, if you write code) to help out on this. Some developers are already collected at&nbsp;<a href="http://projectvrm.org/">ProjectVRM</a>, which is where we’re organizing the effort.</p>
<p>I’m meeting with NPR in Washington, D.C. in a couple hours, and again tomorrow. I’ll bring up the possibility of help from you guys when I talk to them. And I’ll be in many meetings and talks next week at the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.integratedmedia.org/nav.cfm?cat=15&amp;subcat=116&amp;subsub=170">IMA Convention</a>&nbsp;in Boston and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.beyondbroadcast.net/blog/">Beyond Broadcast</a>&nbsp;in Cambridge. Help is welcome.</p>
<p>Let’s show these folks how much more they can do&nbsp;because they relate.&nbsp;Let’s obsolete those annoying fund-raising marathons when they shut off programming, plead poverty and give you some schwag if you send money. There has to be a better way. Let’s build it.</p>

  <p>Summary:      Last week, I reported ID.me’s claim that they were not doing 1:many facial recognition. Turns out that’s not true…  Whether you are a fan of or hate the idea of a national ID, ID.me is on the path to become one. I don’t think having a private third party run the national ID system is a good idea.</p>




<p>Update: The IRS has decided to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/irs-idme-facial-recognition-verification-taxes-2022-2">stop using ID.me for identity verification.</a> In a <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-announces-transition-away-from-use-of-third-party-verification-involving-facial-recognition">statement</a>, IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig said, "Everyone should feel comfortable with how their personal information is secured, and we are quickly pursuing short-term options that do not involve facial recognition." </p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2022/01/irs_using_facial_scanning.shtml">IRS Using Facial Scanning</a>, I reported on the IRS’s move to use the identity proofing and authentication services from ID.me for logging into their online services. ID.me has contracts with other federal agencies like Veteran’s Affairs and numerous states. </p>

<p> One of the controversial aspects of ID.me’s service is an identity proofing service that matches a selfie to the uploaded picture of a government credential. This is called 1:1 facial matching: one selfie, one credential picture. </p>

<p>ID.me’s <a href="https://insights.id.me/press-releases/id-me-comments-on-adherence-to-federal-rules-on-facial-recognition-selfies-that-protect-identities-from-theft/">original press release, since updated</a>, claimed that the company didn’t use 1:many (one-to-many) facial matching where the selfie or ID photo is compared to a database of pictures. But after an internal discussion on ID.me's Slack where an engineer pointed out that the company does, in fact, use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/dg/what-is.html">AWS’s Rekognition service</a> for 1:many facial scanning, ID.me backtracked. </p>

<p>In admitting that ID.me uses 1:many facial recognition, the company ignited a firestorm with privacy watchdogs piling on. A <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/10/face-recognition-isnt-just-face-identification-and-verification">recent EFF article</a>, written before the ID.me revelations, states “Face recognition isn’t just face identification and verification: It’s also photo clustering, race analysis, real-time tracking, and more.” Many are echoing these concerns. And, of course, the fact that ID.me lied about what they were doing is not inspiring confidence. I imagine their management team has had better weeks. In the wake of the revelation, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/29/22907853/irs-idme-facial-recognition-alternatives-privacy-concerns">IRS is reportedly exploring alternatives to ID.me's service.</a> This is a bit disingeuous since it's likely the IRS that pushed for 1:many facial recognition. 
</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/id-me-ceo-backtracks-on-claims-company-doesnt-use-powerful-facial-recognition-tech/">ID.me CEO backtracks on claims company doesn’t use powerful facial recognition tech</a>, Tonya Riley at CyberScoop details the turn around and the events that led up to it. One of the Slack messages reportedly said “We could disable the 1:many face search, but then lose a valuable fraud-fighting tool. Or we could change our public stance on using 1:many face search.” There were no details about how the 1:many facial recognition is used to fight fraud, but there are some obvious ideas. </p>

<p>One way 1:many facial recognition might be used to fight fraud is to keep copies of all the pictures that have been uploaded. If someone tried to steal identities by using fake IDs, then the system would flag that the same face shows up on multiple IDs. I can see why the IRS would want to do this since one way people defraud the IRS is claiming other people’s refunds. And it’s not hard to do with all the personal data for sale on the dark web. Facial recognition could cut this dramatically. </p>

<p>ID.me retains selfies uploaded during the verification process for seven and a half years after an account is closed, per federal guidelines.&nbsp;Of course, you don’t really close your account with the IRS until you’re dead, so that’s a long time. </p>

<p>I don’t like that the IRS is using a third party to do this. But I wouldn’t really like it if they were using <a href="https://login.gov">login.gov</a> either (yeah, that’s a thing). Regardless of who does it, having a huge trove of biometric information sitting out on the internet is just asking for trouble. </p>

<p>As I said last week, the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2022/01/irs_using_facial_scanning.shtml">right solution is to use verifiable credentials</a>. They have <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml#risk">cryptographic properties that prevent the fraud</a> without a big, new trove of biometric and personal data. Specifically the credential exchange can prove the person presenting the credential is the same person who it was issued to. For this to work without at least 1:1 facial scaning, there would have to be a system for in-person identity proofing. Of course, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_ID_Act">RealID provides exactly that</a> if state governments were on board. </p>

<p>Whether you are a fan of or hate the idea of a national ID, ID.me is on the path to become one. I don’t think having a private third party run the national ID system is a good idea. If we’re going to do it, then let’s architect it correctly and securely. But we can keep the current, decentralized system of identification in the US and also prevent fraud with technology available today. I vote for that. </p>

"Some things benefit from shocks; they thrive and grow when exposed to volatility,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness"> randomness</a>, disorder, and stressors and love adventure,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"> risk</a>, and<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty"> uncertainty</a>. Yet, in spite of the ubiquity of the phenomenon, there is no word for the exact opposite of fragile. Let us call it antifragile. Antifragility is beyond resilience or robustness. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better." When writing this, I have the same problem looking for a direct opposite of a Hostile Environment, as in an extreme ecosystem (ecology),&nbsp; and whilst I have opted for a non-hostile environment, anti-hostile would be better.</p><p>&nbsp;In nature, a hostile or<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_environment"> extreme environment</a> is a habitat characterised by harsh environmental conditions, beyond the optimal range for the development of humans, for example, pH 2 or 11, −20°C or 113°C, saturating salt concentrations, high radiation, 200 bars of pressure, among others.&nbsp; These hostile places are super interesting because life is possible, and it is from what life emerged. I will extend the thinking and use this as an analogy to help unpack complex decision making by comparing hostile to non-hostile, extreme to amicable.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Time apparently moves more slowly than in a non-hostile environment than in a hostile environment.&nbsp; Time, in this case, is about the period between change.&nbsp; Change in a hostile environment is challenging and has to be done in tiny steps over a long period of time. Rapid change increases the risk of death and non-survival. &nbsp; To survive in a hostile environment, the living thing needs stability and resilience.&nbsp; The processes (chemistry) methods (biology) must be finely adjusted to become incredibly efficient and effective - efficacy matters. Change is incremental and very slow.&nbsp; To survive, sharing is a better option; having facts (data) matters, you survive together, and there are few paradoxes. Of note is that hostile environments will become less hostile. As it moved from an acidic creation to our current diversity, the earth is worthy of note.</p><p>In a non-hostile environment, time can move fast between iteration/ adaptation.&nbsp; The risk of a change leading to death is lower as the environment is tolerant of change. &nbsp; The jumps can be more significant with fewer threats.&nbsp; Because the environment has a wide tolerance, it is less sensitive to risk (5 sigma deviation is acceptable); therefore, you can have large scale automation, programmable algorithms and less finely tuned processes, methods and rules.&nbsp; Innovation and change will come thick and fast as the environment is amiable and amicable.&nbsp; The time between this innovation and adaptation is fast. &nbsp; The environment creates more volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity. &nbsp; Politics and power focus on control over survival.&nbsp; The world is full of paradoxes.&nbsp; Non-hostile environments will become more hostile.&nbsp;</p><p>----</p><p>Yes, there are problems will all analogies, and this one breaks down; however, there is a principle here worth thinking about.&nbsp; In hostile environments, there are fewer paradoxes. &nbsp; I would argue that this is because survival is one driving purpose.&nbsp; Survival is one of the four-opposing purposes in the peak-paradox model.&nbsp; &nbsp; In non-hostile environments, you can optimise for more than one thing.&nbsp; Indeed you can have many purposes all competing.&nbsp; This leads to many paradoxes. &nbsp; In work environments where senior leadership is unable to comprehend paradoxes, I also observe hostile environments (different to natural ones but just as toxic).&nbsp; Where I find teams that embrace VUCA, innovation, change and can see the paradoxes in their data, facts and knowledge;&nbsp; observe congenial, amenable, non-hostile and anti-hostile environments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The key here is not this observation but about direction.&nbsp; Knowing which camp you are in is essential, but so too is knowing the direction. How to measure Peak-Hostility is going to be another post. Non-hostile places tend to become more hostile because of politics and power dynamics; dealing with paradoxes is hard work.&nbsp; Because they demand working together and clarity of purpose, hostile environments can become less hostile.</p><p>If we plot this thinking on the Peak Pardox framework, I believe it will be difficult to escape the dynamics of Peak Human Purpose (survival) until scarcity is resolved.&nbsp; At Peak Individual Purpose, the few will control, but this creates a hostile environment for the majority.&nbsp; Peak Work, we observe fierce competition between the two camps, where hostile can win by focussing on costs, but non-hostile wins through innovation.&nbsp; At Peak Society Purpose - there is something unique as non-hostile could lead to anti-hostile.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>As to decision-making, what becomes critical is whether your decision-making processes match your (hostile/ non-hostile) environment and direction, as they demand very different approaches.&nbsp; Hostile, in many ways, is more straightforward as there is a much more defined purpose to which decisions can be aligned.&nbsp; Non-hostile introduce paradoxes, optimisation and complexity into the processes with many interested stakeholders.&nbsp; If there is a mismatch in methods, this can be destructive—much more to think about.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br>

  <p>Summary:      When we dine at a restaurant in the physical world, we do not do so within some administrative system. Rather, as embodied agents, we operationalize our relationships by acting for ourselves. Web3, if built correctly, can help people to act as full-fledged participants in the digital realm.</p>



<p>
    I stumbled across <a href="https://jaygraber.medium.com/web3-is-self-certifying-9dad77fd8d81">Web3 is Self-Certifying</a> from <a href="https://jaygraber.medium.com/">Jay Graber</a>. Jay's post resonated with me on several points. First, her <a href="https://twitter.com/arcalinea/status/1474165024092352524">tweet about the article</a> said "You might notice I wrote this whole post on the 'decentralized web' without using the words 'decentralized' or 'distributed' even once. I am tired of defining the things we want to build through negatives. That doesn't say what it is." This has been a sticking point for me for some time. For example, in an <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-true-and-effective-is-Web-3-0-s-power-of-decentralization-or-more-power-to-the-big-companies-involved/answer/Phil-Windley"> answer I authored on Quora about Web3</a>, I said:
</p>

<blockquote>
    First things first: while people often talk about decentralization as an unalloyed good and the answer to every ill, the truth is that decentralization is just an implementation strategy. The goals of Web3 include self-sovereignty (autonomy and independence) and censorship resistance. Decentralization is a good way to achieve these things, but I can imagine decentralized services (in the technical sense) that don’t achieve either of these. It’s ok to use “decentralization” as short hand for these goals, but recognize the goals, not the implementation technique.
</blockquote>

<p>
    Decentralization isn't the goal. The goals are much more grand and include nothing less than a digital world that respects human dignity and autonomy.
</p>

<p>
    Jay defines Web3 as user-generated authority, enabled by self-certifying web protocols. I like "self-sovereign" better than "user-generated" because I think it <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/cogito_ergo_sum.shtml">better speaks to the the source of our authority to act</a>. Besides, user makes me think of a druggie dependent on someone for their next fix. Sovereign is the right word for describing the essential distinction between our inalienable self and the administrative identifiers and accounts endemic in Web2. But still, her work to define Web3 in terms of sovereign-source authority and self-certifying protocols gives me hope.
</p>

<p>
    Following up on this, Jay distinguishes Web 1.0 from Web 2.0 from Web 3.0. I've tried to capture her thoughts, briefly, in this graphic:
</p>

	<a></a>
	Web 1.0 vs 2.0 vs 3.0 (click to enlarge)


<p>
    In this figure, a "host" is some server, somewhere. In Web 1.0, it was just the machine under my desk with no notion of users other than me. Web 2.0 separated the need to host the content from the desire to generate it. Blogging on a platform like Radio, Typepad, or Wordpress was one example. Later, Twitter, Facebook, and other social media platforms filled this role and became behemoths. In Web 3.0, people (a word I like better than "user") can return to generating content (broadly defined) under their own authority.
</p>

<p>
    The term "self-certifying is also something that caught my eye because it's a <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml#autonomic">core feature of autonomic identity systems</a> which I believe must form the basis for any <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2022/01/web3_and_digital_embodiment.shtml">future web where people have the tools to act independently—what I've called digital embodiment</a>. An easy way to think about self-certification is that it describes systems (and protocols) that don't rely on third parties. Peer DIDs and KERI are self-certifying because they rely solely on self-sovereign authority.
</p>

<p>
    Closely related to the idea of self-certification is self-administration. Self-administration means that something is independently administered by the controller. Again, no third party needed. I <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/11/picos_at_the_edge.shtml">wrote about an example of this</a>, <a href="https://nofilter.org/">NoFilter.org</a>, that provides self-certifying and self-administered blogging using Metamask, some Javascript, and IPFS. No third parties (hosts or platforms) to say what can or can't be posted, censor me, surveil me, or otherwise intermediate me and my post.
</p>

<p>
    A self-certifying protocol is based on a self-certifying, cryptographic identifier (I call them <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml?utm_campaign=Technometria&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter#autonomic">autonomic identifiers</a>), but uses content addressable data. Content addressable data is any data that can be located based on its cryptographic hash. Using the private key associated with an autonomic identifier to sign the hash of the data provides a way to claim control of that data. This is self-sovereign authority and makes data portable because it's authenticity is not based on where its found, but the signature. This is in contrast to Web 2.0 where the authenticity of data (say a tweet) depends on its particular place on the Twitter servers in a hierarchy controlled by Twitter. Goodbye client-server.  Note that in all of this blockchains and other decentralizing technologies are just implementation strategies, not end results. 
</p>

<p>
    Web3,  self-sovereign authority enabled by self-certifying protocols, gives us a mechanism for creating a digital existence that respects human dignity and autonomy.
    We can live lives as digitally embodied beings able to <a>operationalize our digital relationships</a> in ways that provide rich, meaningful interactions. Self-sovereign identity (SSI) and self-certifying protocols provide people with the tools they need to operationalize their self-sovereign authority and act as peers with others online. When we dine at a restaurant or shop at a store in the physical world, we do not do so within some administrative system. Rather, as embodied agents, we operationalize our relationships, whether they be long-lived or nascent, by acting for ourselves. Web3, built in this way, allows people to act as full-fledged participants in the digital realm.

<p>This article shows how to use a downstream API protected with certificate authentication using Microsoft  <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/reverse-proxy">YARP</a> reverse proxy from a Blazor application. The Blazor WASM HTTP requests are sent to a secured backend which uses YARP to forward the requests to the API protected with the certificate <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/certauth">authentication</a>. The Blazor application authenticates using the OpenIddict identity provider using the BFF security architecture. The downstream API which is protected using the certificate authentication is deployed to an Azure App Service and requires a known client certificate to use the API.</p>



<p>Code <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCoreOpeniddict">https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCoreOpeniddict</a></p>



<p>Setup</p>



<p>The application was built using the <a href="https://github.com/openiddict/openiddict-samples">openiddict-samples</a> and the Dantooine sample. Only small changes to the YARP configuration is required to implement the API calls. The dotnet template  <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/Blazor.BFF.OpenIDConnect.Template">Blazor.BFF.OpenIDConnect.Template</a> could also be used to setup the Blazor application. This pre-configures the BFF authentication and uses standard OpenID Connect.</p>



<p>The API protected using certificate authentication is implemented using the following code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCoreCertificates/tree/main/examplesUsingCertificateAuthentication/AzureCertAuth">AzureCertAuth</a>. This application is deployed to the Azure App service and certificates are required to use the application. The server validates that the correct certificate is used to access the API.</p>







<p>The YARP reverse proxy is setup in the startup class and the app settings. The client certificate required for the downstream API, is loaded into the project using the X509Certificate2 class. This could be loaded from the operating system, or Azure key vault or some other secure way. The demo loads this directly in an unsecure way. </p>



<p>The AddReverseProxy method adds the YARP definitions and the ConfigureHttpClient method is used to add the SslOptions containing the client certificate which is used for the Azure API calls. The MapReverseProxy is used to add the endpoints and reads the configuration from the app settings.</p>


  public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
	// ...

   // Create an authorization policy used by YARP when forwarding requests
   // from the WASM application to the Dantooine.Api1 resource server.
   services.AddAuthorization(options =&gt; options.AddPolicy("CookieAuthenticationPolicy", builder =&gt;
   {
      builder.AddAuthenticationSchemes(CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme);
      builder.RequireAuthenticatedUser();
    }));

	var cert = new X509Certificate2("client.pfx", "1234");

	services.AddReverseProxy()
		 .ConfigureHttpClient((context, handler) =&gt;
		 {
			 handler.SslOptions = new SslClientAuthenticationOptions
			 {
				ClientCertificates = new X509CertificateCollection
				{
					cert
				}
			 };
		 })
		.LoadFromConfig(Configuration.GetSection("ReverseProxy"));
}

public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
	// ...
	
	app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =&gt;
	{
		endpoints.MapRazorPages();
		endpoints.MapControllers();
		endpoints.MapReverseProxy();
		endpoints.MapFallbackToPage("/_Host");
	});
}
  


<p>The ReverseProxy settings adds the configuration which is almost standard like the documentation. The CookieAuthenticationPolicy is used to accept only authenticated requests.</p>


  "ReverseProxy": {
	"Routes": {
	  "route1": {
		"ClusterId": "cluster1",
		"AuthorizationPolicy": "CookieAuthenticationPolicy",
		"Match": {
		  "Path": "{**catch-all}"
		}
	  }
	},
	"Clusters": {
	  "cluster1": {
		"HttpClient": {
		  "SslProtocols": [
			"Tls12"
		  ]
		},
		"Destinations": {
		  "cluster1/destination1": {
			"Address": "https://azurecertauth20201108214641.azurewebsites.net/"
		  }
		}
	  }
	}
}
  


<p>Blazor WASM is used to implement the UI which calls the YARP endpoint. The backend validates the HTTP requests for a secure cookie and a valid session and uses a client certificate to get the data from the Azure API. The Azure API validates the client certificate. </p>







<p>Notes</p>



<p>This works nicely and the downstream APIs can be protected in a secure way. Using this approach, it is very easy to increase security or implement the app to app security in a good way. Of course security is only as good as the weakest link. The WASM UI view calling to the API protected with cookies is now the weakest link, depending of course on how you secure the downstream APIs, but these should not be a problem to do correctly. The API using the YARP reverse proxy uses cookies but has no anti-forgery protection in this demo. This would need to be added. </p>

<p>Recently, we and a number of our neighbors have been noticing our lights flickering in the evening and early morning. While we have considered it to be mostly an annoyance, this has bothered some of our neighbors enough that they have opened cases with the utility and began raising the issue on our street mailing list.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.pge.com">Pacific Gas and Electric</a> (PG&amp;E) responded to these customers with a visit, and in some cases replaced the service entrance cable to the home. In at least one case PG&amp;E also said they might need to replace the pole transformer, which would take a few months to complete. I have heard no reports that these efforts have made any difference.</p>



<p>This <a href="https://altmode.org/2020/09/08/line-voltage-fluctuations/">isn’t our first recent challenge</a> with voltage regulation in our neighborhood. Our most recent issue was a longer-term voltage regulation problem that occurred on hot days, apparently due to load from air conditioners and the fact that our neighborhood is fed by older 4-kilovolt service from the substation. This is different, and raised several questions:</p>



  How local are the anomalies? Are neighbors on different parts of the street seeing the same anomalies, or are they localized to particular pole transformers or individual homes?  What is the duration and nature of the anomalies?  Are they only happening in the evening and early morning, or do we just notice them at these times?  



<p>To try to answer these questions, I found a test rig that I built several years ago when we were noticing some dimming of our lights, apparently due to neighbors’ air conditioners starting on summer evenings. The test rig consists of a pair of filament transformers: 110 volt to 6 volt transformers that were used in equipment with electronic tubes, which typically used 6 volts to heat the tube’s filament. The transformers are connected in cascade to reduce the line voltage to a suitable level for the line-in audio input on a computer. An open-source audio editing program, <a href="https://www.audacityteam.org/">Audacity</a>, is used to record the line voltage. I often joke that this is a very boring recording: mostly just a continuous 60 hertz tone.</p>



<p>At the same time, I started recording the times our lights flickered (or my uninterruptable power supply clicked, another symptom). I asked my neighbors to record when they see their lights flicker and report that back to me.</p>



<p>I created a collection of 24-hour recordings of the power line, and went looking for the reported power anomalies. It was a bit of a tedious process, because not everyone’s clocks are exactly synchronized. But I was successful in identifying several power anomalies that were observed by neighbors on opposite ends of the street (about three blocks). Here’s a typical example:</p>



<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2022/02/powerglitch.png"></a>Typical power anomaly



<p>As you can see, the problem is very short in duration, about 60 milliseconds or so.</p>



<p>I was getting a lot of flicker reports, and as I mentioned, searching for these anomalies was tedious. So I began looking at the analysis capabilities of Audacity. I noticed a <a href="https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/silence_finder.html">Silence Finder</a> plug-in and attempted to search for the anomalies using that tool. But Silence Finder is designed to find the kind of silence that one might find between tracks on an LP: very quiet for a second or so. Not surprisingly, Silence Finder didn’t find anything for me.</p>



<p>I noticed that Silence Finder is written in a specialized Lisp-like signal processing language known as <a href="https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/nyquist.html">Nyquist</a>. So I had a look at the source code, which is included with Audacity, and was able to understand quite a bit of what was going on. For efficiency reasons, Silence Finder down-samples the input data so it doesn’t have to deal with as much data. In order to search for shorter anomalies, I needed to change that, as well as the user interface limits on minimum silence duration. Also, the amplitude of the silence was expressed in dB, which makes sense for audio but I needed more sensitivity to subtle changes in amplitude. So I changed the silence amplitude from dB to a linear voltage value.</p>



<p>The result was quite helpful. The modified plug-in, which I called “Glitch Finder”, was able to quite reliably find voltage anomalies. For example:</p>



<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2022/02/20220129-170512-1.png"></a>Power recording 1/29/2022-1/30/2022



<p>The label track generated by Glitch Finder points out the location of the anomalies (at 17:05:12, 23:00:12, and 7:17:56 the next morning), although they’re not visible at this scale. Zoom in a few times and they become quite obvious:</p>



<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2022/02/20220130-071756.png"></a>Power anomaly at 1/30/2022 7:17:56



<p>Thus far I have reached these tentative conclusions:</p>



  The power problems are primarily common to the neighborhood, and unlikely to be caused by a local load transient such as plugging an electric car in.  They seem to be concentrated mainly in the evening (4-11 pm) and morning (6-10 am). These seem to be times when power load is changing, due to heating, cooking, lighting, and home solar power systems going off and on at sunset and sunrise.  The longer term voltage goes up or down a bit at the time of a power anomaly. This requires further investigation, but may be due to switching activity by the utility.  



 Further work 



<p>As usual, a study like this often raises new questions about as quickly as it answers questions. Here are a few that I’m still curious about.</p>



  What is the actual effect on lights that causes people to notice these anomalies so easily? I currently have an oscilloscope connected to a photoelectric cell, set to trigger when the lights flash. It will be interesting to see how that compares with the magnitude of the anomaly.  Do LED lights manifest this more than incandescent bulbs? It seems unlikely that such a short variation would affect the filament temperature of an incandescent bulb significantly.  Do the anomalies correlate with any longer-term voltage changes? My test rig measures long-term voltage in an uncalibrated way, but the processing I’m currently doing doesn’t make it easy to look at longer-term voltage changes as well.

   <blockquote> The fight against "Bureaucratic Supremacy" affects us all. Time for unity beyond the dysfunctional cult politics driving people apart from their independence. </blockquote> Words are thinking tools; used wrongly, contrived inappropriately, disseminated poorly, words can cause great harm to people and society. This is being demonstrated for all people to witness in 2020++ <br>  History is long; let the dead past bury its dead. You are here, now, and the structure of your participation in this life, the administration of your Rights in civil society, matters a great deal for the results both are capable of rendering.  <br>  "We the people" is an example of how words crafted by intent, can be manipulated over time to render outcomes out-of-step with their original intent. Once upon a time.. "people" was an easy word to define. An experiment in self-governance, unique in all the world and history, arrived because people made it so. Fast forward to 2022, and people no longer function as "people" under the law; in lieu of basic observable fact, a bureaucratic interpretation and abstraction of intent has been allowed to take root among people.  <br>  Oft confused in 2020++ with phrases like "white supremacy", or "Institutional racism", methods of administrative bureaucracy have taken a supreme role in defining and operationalizing Rights defined for "people". This "bureaucratic supremacy" has allowed abstraction of words like "people" to render a Government operated by bureaucrats, not under the authority of the people "of, by, for" whom it was originally conceived and instantiated, but instead under methods of processing bureaucratic intent. From the point-of-view of the oppressed historically, the bureaucracy has skin in the game, and domination is absolute. But, from the point-of-view of the unexperienced future derived "of, by, for" people, skin has nothing to do with it. History's leverage is one of administrative origin.  <br>  Pandemics will come and go in time; experiences of the administrative machinery that guarantees the integrity, security and continued self-governance of society by people should never be overlooked. Especially in the context of now "computational" Constitutional Rights for people, (not birth certificates - vaccination passport holders - or ID verification methods &amp; artifacts poorly designed) where operational structure determines the integrity of operational run time results. Literature might say "Freedom of Speech" is a Right, but if the administrative system does not compute said Rights, then they cease to exist.&nbsp;  <br>  "Bureaucratic Supremacy" has a predictable moat surrounding its practices; credentialed labor. Employees with labor certifications are only as useful as the validity of the credential under inspection and in practice. Administering the permission to be hired, work, contribute value and extend a meaningful voice into a civil system is easily sequestered if/when that credential is meaningless under inspection, and is only used as means of identifying bureaucratic compliance.  <br>  Bureaucratic supremacy is the direct result of bureaucratic compliance; people, functioning as "people" willing to cede their inalienable rights in exchange for a paycheck, yield a systemic approach to human management that often counters the initial intent and integrity of a systems existence. Often heard when something happens that lacks systemic integrity, "I was only doing my job" represents an output of bureaucratic fraud, whereby people claim plausible deniability of responsibility and accountability based on the structure of their working efforts. Corporate law is founded on the premise of "liability control", whereby a resulting bureaucracy allows real human choices to function as bureaucratic outcomes lacking any real direct human definition. People are no longer operating as "people" when abstracted by the law in such ways, and the world over, systems of bureaucracy with historic significance control and confuse the interpretation of results that such a system of labor induces.  <br>  Rooted at the origin of a self-governed civil society is an original act of human Sovereignty. In America, this act is writ large by John Hancock for a King's benefit, as well as every administrative bureaucracy the world will ever come to experience. People declare independence from bureaucracies by personal Sovereign authority. This is the <a href="https://www.moxytongue.com/2012/02/what-is-sovereign-source-authority.html">root of Sovereign authority</a>, and can never be provisioned by a bureaucracy. Bureaucratic supremacy is a perversion of this intent, and labor credentials make it so.  <br>  Where do "we" go from here?  <br>  People, Individuals all, is the only living reality of the human species that will ever actually exist. People, living among one another, never cease to function as Individuals, and any systemic process that uses a literary abstraction, or computational abstraction to induce "we" into a bureaucratic form is an aggressive act of fraud against Humanity, and the Sovereignty defined "of, by, for" such people.  <br>  In America, people are not the dog of their Government; self-governance is man's best friend. The order of operations in establishing such a "more perfect Union" is critical for its sustained existence. Be wary of listening to lifetime bureaucrats; they will speak with words that are no longer tools for human advancement, but instead, are designed to reinforce the "bureaucratic supremacy" of the authority derived by their labor credentials. Inspect those credentials directly to ensure they are legitimate, for false labor credentials are endemic.  <br>  Structure yields results; fraud by bureaucracy and Rights for people are juxtapositional and never exist in the same place at the same time.&nbsp;  <br>  Think About It.. More Individuals in Civil Society Needed:&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/KHbzSif78qQ">https://youtu.be/KHbzSif78qQ</a>  <br>  <br>

<p>The article shows how to implement a progressive web application (PWA) using Blazor which is secured using the backend for frontend architecture and Azure B2C as the identity provider. </p>



<p>Code <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/PwaBlazorBffAzureB2C-">https://github.com/damienbod/PwaBlazorBffAzureB2C</a></p>



<p>Setup and challenges with PWAs </p>



<p>The application is setup to implement all security in the trusted backend and reduce the security risks of the overall software. We use Azure B2C as an identity provider. When implementing and using BFF security architecture, cookies are used to secure the Blazor WASM UI and its backend. <a href="https://github.com/search?q=Microsoft.Identity.Web">Microsoft.Identity.Web</a> is used to implement the authentication as recommended by Microsoft for server rendered applications. Anti-forgery tokens as well as all the other cookie protections can be used to reduce the risk of CSRF attacks. This requires that the WASM application is hosted in an ASP.NET Core razor page and the dynamic data can be added. With PWA applications, this is not possible. To work around this, CORS preflight and custom headers can be used to protect against this as well as same site. The anti-forgery cookies need to be removed to support PWAs. Using CORS preflight has some disadvantages compared to anti-forgery cookies but works good.</p>







<p>Setup Blazor BFF with Azure B2C for PWA</p>



<p>The application is setup using the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Blazor.BFF.AzureB2C.Template">Blazor.BFF.AzureB2C.Template</a> Nuget package. This uses anti-forgery cookies. All of the anti-forgery protection can be completely removed. The Azure App registrations and the Azure B2C user flows need to be setup and the application should work (without PWA support).</p>



<p>To setup the PWA support, you need to add an index.html file to the wwwroot of the Blazor client and a service worker JS script to implement the PWA. The index.html file adds what is required and the serviceWorkerRegistration.js script is linked.</p>


  &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;

                &lt;div class="spinner-border text-success" role="status"&gt;
                    &lt;span class="sr-only"&gt;Loading...&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div id="blazor-error-ui"&gt;
            An unhandled error has occurred.
            &lt;a href="" class="reload"&gt;Reload&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;a class="dismiss"&gt;🗙&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;script src="_framework/blazor.webassembly.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        &lt;script src="serviceWorkerRegistration.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;
  


<p>The serviceWorker.published.js script is pretty standard except that the OpenID Connect redirects and signout URLs need to be excluded from the PWA and always rendered from the trusted backend. The registration script references the service worker so that the inline Javascript is removed from the html because we do not allow unsafe inline scripts anywhere in an application if possible.</p>


  navigator.serviceWorker.register('service-worker.js');
  


<p>The service worker excludes all the required authentication URLs and any other required server URLs. The published script registers the PWA. </p>



<p>Note: if you would like to test the PWA locally without deploying the application, you can reference the published script directly and it will run locally. You need to be carefully testing as the script and the cache needs to be emptied before testing each time.</p>

<p>The ServiceWorkerAssetsManifest definition needs to be added to the client project.</p>


  &lt;ServiceWorkerAssetsManifest&gt;service-worker-assets.js&lt;/ServiceWorkerAssetsManifest&gt;
  


<p>Now the PWA should work. The next step is to add the extra CSRF protection.</p>



<p>Setup CSRF protection using CORS preflight</p>



<p>CORS preflight can be used to protect against CSRF as well as same site. All API calls should include a custom HTTP header and this needs to be controlled on the APIs that the header exists.</p>



<p>The can be implemented in the Blazor WASM client by using a CSRF middleware protection. </p>


  public class CsrfProtectionCorsPreflightAttribute : ActionFilterAttribute
{
	public override void OnActionExecuting(ActionExecutingContext context)
	{
		var header = context.HttpContext
			.Request
			.Headers
			.Any(p =&gt; p.Key.ToLower() == "x-force-cors-preflight");
			
		if (!header)
		{
			// "X-FORCE-CORS-PREFLIGHT header is missing"
			context.Result = new UnauthorizedObjectResult("X-FORCE-CORS-PREFLIGHT header is missing");
			return;
		}
	}
}
  


<p>In the Blazor client, the middleware can be added to all HttpClient instances used in the Blazor WASM.</p>


  builder.Services.AddHttpClient("default", client =&gt;
{
	client.BaseAddress = new Uri(builder.HostEnvironment.BaseAddress);
	client.DefaultRequestHeaders
		.Accept
		.Add(new MediaTypeWithQualityHeaderValue("application/json"));
		
}).AddHttpMessageHandler&lt;CsrfProtectionMessageHandler&gt;(); 

builder.Services.AddHttpClient("authorizedClient", client =&gt;
{
	client.BaseAddress = new Uri(builder.HostEnvironment.BaseAddress);
	client.DefaultRequestHeaders
		.Accept
		.Add(new MediaTypeWithQualityHeaderValue("application/json"));
		
}).AddHttpMessageHandler&lt;AuthorizedHandler&gt;()
.AddHttpMessageHandler&lt;CsrfProtectionMessageHandler&gt;();
  


<p>The CSRF CORS preflight header can be validated using an ActionFilter in the ASP.NET Core backend application. This is not the only way of doing this. The CsrfProtectionCorsPreflightAttribute implements the ActionFilterAttribute so only the OnActionExecuting needs to be implemented. The custom header is validated and if it fails, an unauthorized result is returned. It does not matter if you give the reason why, unless you want to obfuscate this a bit.</p>


  public class CsrfProtectionCorsPreflightAttribute : ActionFilterAttribute
{
	public override void OnActionExecuting(ActionExecutingContext context)
	{
		var header = context.HttpContext
			.Request
			.Headers
			.Any(p =&gt; p.Key.ToLower() == "x-force-cors-preflight");
			
		if (!header)
		{
			// "X-FORCE-CORS-PREFLIGHT header is missing"
			context.Result = new UnauthorizedObjectResult("X-FORCE-CORS-PREFLIGHT header is missing");
			return;
		}
	}
}
  


<p>The CSRF can then be applied anywhere this is required. All secured routes where cookies are used should enforce this.</p>


  [CsrfProtectionCorsPreflight]
[Authorize(AuthenticationSchemes = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)]
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class DirectApiController : ControllerBase
{
	[HttpGet]
	public IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; Get()
	{
		return new List&lt;string&gt; { "some data", "more data", "loads of data" };
	}
}
  


<p>Now the PWA works using the server rendered application and protected using BFF with all security in the trusted backend.</p>



<p>Problems with this solution and Blazor</p>



<p>The custom header cannot be applied and added when sending direct links, redirects or forms which don’t use Javascript. Anywhere a form is implemented and requires the CORS preflight protection, a HttpClient which adds the header needs to be used.</p>



<p>This is a problem with the Azure B2C signin and signout. The signin redirects the whole application, but this is not so much a problem because when signing in, the identity has no cookie with sensitive data, or should have none. The signout only works correctly with Azure B2C with a form request from the whole application and not HttpClient API call using Javascript. The CORS preflight header cannot be applied to an Azure B2C identity provider signout request, if you require the session to be ended on Azure B2C. If you only require a local logout, then the HttpClient can be used. </p>



<p>Note: Same site protection also exists for modern browsers, so this double CSRF fallback is not really critical, if the same site is implemented correctly and using a browser which enforces this.</p>

<p>I’ve worked from home since 1998. All along I’ve hoped many more people would enjoy the privilege and share in the benefits. Now that it’s finally happening, and seems likely to continue in some form, let’s take a moment to reflect on an underappreciated benefit: neighborhood revitalization. </p>
<p>I was a child of the 1960s, and spent my grade school years in a newly-built suburb of Philadelphia. Commuter culture was well established by then, so the dads in the neighborhood were gone during the day. So were some of the moms, mine included, but many were at home and were able to keep an eye on us kids as we played in back yards after school. And our yards were special. A group of parents had decided not to fence them, thus creating what was effectively a private park. The games we played varied from season to season but always involved a group of kids roaming along that grassy stretch. Nobody was watching us most of the time. Since the kitchens all looked out on the back yards, though, there was benign surveillance. Somebody’s mom might be looking out at any given moment, and if things got out of hand, somebody’s mom would hear that. </p>
<p>For most kids, a generation later, that freedom was gone. Not for ours, though! They were in grade school when BYTE Magazine ended and I began my remote career. Our house became an after-school gathering place for our kids and their friends. With me in my front office, and Luann in her studio in the back, those kids enjoyed a rare combination of freedom and safety. We were mostly working, but at any given moment we could engage with them in ways that most parents never could. </p>
<p>I realized that commuter culture had, for several generations, sucked the daytime life out of neighborhoods. What we initially called telecommuting wasn’t just a way to save time, reduce stress, and burn less fossil fuel. It held the promise of restoring that daytime life.</p>
<p>All this came back to me powerfully at the height of the pandemic lockdown. Walking around the neighborhood on a weekday afternoon I’d see families hanging out, kids playing, parents working on landscaping projects and tinkering in garages, neighbors talking to one another. This was even better than my experience in the 2000s because more people shared it.</p>
<p>Let’s hold that thought. Even if many return to offices on some days of the week, I believe and hope that we’ve normalized working from home on other days. By inhabiting our neighborhoods more fully on weekdays, we can perhaps begin to repair a social fabric frayed by generations of commuter culture.</p>
<p>Meanwhile here is a question to ponder. Why do we say that we are working from and not working at home?</p>

<p>I’m a bit of a sustainability nerd. I love the idea of living a life where your carbon footprint is neutral (or negative) and you leave the world a better place than it was before you got here.</p>

<p>While it’s clear that there’s only <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions">so much impact</a> an individual can have on carbon emissions, I like the idea of working to minimize my personal carbon footprint. This is a big part of the reason why I live in a home with solar power, drive an electric vehicle, and try to avoid single-use plastics as much as possible.</p>

<p>During a recent impact-focused hackathon at <a href="https://snyk.io">work</a> (<a href="https://snyk.io/careers/">come work with me!</a>), I found myself working on an interesting sustainability project. Our team’s idea was simple: because almost all Snyk employees work remotely using a Mac laptop, could we measure the energy consumption of every employee’s Mac laptop to better understand how much energy it takes to power employee devices, as well as the amount of carbon work devices produce?</p>

<p>Because we know (on average) <a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=74&amp;t=11">how much carbon</a> it takes to produce a single kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity in the US (0.85 pounds of CO2 emissions per kWh), if we could figure out how many kWh of electricity were being used by employee devices, we’d be able to do some simple math and figure out two things:</p>

 
 How much energy is required to power employee devices 
 How much carbon is being put into the atmosphere by employee devices 
 

<p>Using this data, we could then donate money to a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/best-carbon-offset-programs-5114611">carbon offsetting service</a> to “neutralize” the impact of our employee’s work devices.</p>

<p>PROBLEM: Now, would this be a perfectly accurate way of measuring the true carbon impact of employees? Absolutely not – there are obviously many things we cannot easily measure (such as the amount of energy of attached devices, work travel, food consumption, etc.), but the idea of being able to quantify the carbon impact of work laptops was still interesting enough that we decided to pursue it regardless.</p>

 Potential Energy Tracking Solutions 

<p>The first idea we had was to use smart energy monitoring plugs that employees could plug their work devices into while charging. These plugs could then store a tally of how much energy work devices consume, and we could aggregate that somewhere to get a total amount of energy usage.</p>

<p>I happen to have several of the <a href="https://www.evehome.com/en/eve-energy">Eve Energy</a> smart plugs around my house (which I highly recommend if you use Apple’s HomeKit) that I’ve been using to track my personal energy usage for a while now.</p>

<p></p>

<p>While these devices are incredible (they work well, come with a beautiful app, etc.), unfortunately, they don’t have any sort of publicly accessible API you can use to extract energy consumption data.</p>

<p>We also looked into various other types of smart home energy monitoring plugs, including the <a href="https://amzn.to/341CXQt">Kasa Smart Plug Mini</a>, which does happen to have <a href="https://github.com/python-kasa/python-kasa">an API</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, however, because Snyk is a global company with employees all over the world, hardware solutions were looking less and less appealing as to do what we wanted, we’d need to:</p>

 
 Ship country-specific devices to each new and existing employee 
 Include setup instructions for employees (how to configure the plugs, how to hook them up to a home network, etc.) 
 Instruct employees to always plug their work devices into these smart plugs, which many people may forget to do 
 

 Is It Possible to Track Mac Energy Consumption Using Software? 

<p>When <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/seanmclarke/">someone on the team</a> proposed using software to track energy consumption, I thought it’d be a simple task. I assumed there were various existing tools we could easily leverage to grab energy consumption data. But boy, oh boy, I was wrong!</p>

<p>As it turns out, it’s quite complicated to figure out how many watt-hours of electricity your Mac laptop is using. To the best of my knowledge, there are no off-the-shelf applications that do this.</p>

<p>Through my research, however, I stumbled across a couple potential solutions.</p>

 Using Battery Metrics to Calculate Energy Consumption 

<p>The first idea I had was to figure out the size of the laptop’s battery (in milliamp-hours (mAh)), as well as how many complete discharge cycles the battery has been through (how many times has the battery been fully charged and discharged).</p>

<p>This information would theoretically allow us to determine how much energy a Mac laptop has ever consumed by multiplying the size of the battery in mAh by the number of battery cycles. We could then simply convert the number of mAh -&gt; kWh using a simple formula.</p>

<p>After a lot of Google-fu and command-line scripting, I was able to get this information using the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/DeviceDrivers/Conceptual/IOKitFundamentals/TheRegistry/TheRegistry.html">ioreg command-line tool</a>, but in the process, I realized that there was a critical problem with this approach.</p>

<p>The problem is that while the variables I mentioned above will allow you to calculate the energy consumption of your laptop over time, when your laptop is fully charged and plugged into a wall outlet it isn’t drawing down energy from the battery – it’s using the electricity directly from your wall.</p>

<p>This means that the measuring approach above will only work if you never use your laptop while it is plugged into wall chargers – you’d essentially need to keep your laptop shut down while charging and only have it turned on while on battery power. Obviously, this is not very realistic.</p>

 Using Wall Adapter Information to Calculate Energy Consumption 

<p>After the disappointing battery research, I decided to take a different approach. What if there was a way to extract how much energy your laptop was pulling from a wall adapter?</p>

<p>If we were able to figure out how many watts of electricity, for example, your laptop was currently drawing from a wall adapter, we could track this information over time to determine the amount of watt-hours of electricity being consumed. We could then easily convert this number to kWh or any other desired measure.</p>

<p>And… After a lot of sifting through <code>ioreg</code> output and some help from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jdegges/">my little brother</a> (an engineer who helps build <a href="https://www.span.io">smart home electric panels</a>), I was able to successfully extract the amount of watts being pulled from a plugged-in wall adapter! Woo!</p>

 The Final Solution: How to Calculate the Energy Consumption of Your Mac Using Software 

<p>After many hours of research and playing around, what I ended up building was a small shell script that parses through <code>ioreg</code> command-line output and extracts the amount of watts being pulled from a plugged-in wall adapter.</p>

<p>This shell script runs on a cron job once a minute, logging energy consumption information to a file. This file can then be analyzed to compute the amount of energy consumed by a Mac device over a given time period.</p>

<p>I’ve packaged this solution up into a small GitHub project you can check out <a href="https://github.com/rdegges/energy-tracker">here</a>.</p>

<p>The command I’m using to grab the wattage information is the following:</p>

 <code>/usr/sbin/ioreg -rw0 -c AppleSmartBattery | grep BatteryData | grep -o '"AdapterPower"=[0-9]*' | cut -c 16- | xargs -I %  lldb --batch -o "print/f %" | grep -o '$0 = [0-9.]*' | cut -c 6-
</code> 

<p>Here it is broken down with a brief description of what these commands are doing:</p>

 <code>/usr/sbin/ioreg -rw0 -c AppleSmartBattery | \  # retrieve power data
  grep BatteryData | \                         # filter it down to battery stats
  grep -o '"AdapterPower"=[0-9]*' | \          # extract adapter power info
  cut -c 16- | \                               # extract power info number
  xargs -I %  lldb --batch -o "print/f %" | \  # convert power info into an IEEE 754 float
  grep -o '$0 = [0-9.]*' | \                   # extract only the numbers
  cut -c 6-                                    # remove the formatting
</code> 

<p>The output of this command is a number which is the amount of watts currently being consumed by your laptop (I verified this by confirming it with hardware energy monitors). In order to turn this value into a usable energy consumption metric, you have to sample it over time. After thinking this through, here was the logging format I came up with to make tracking energy consumption simple:</p>

 <code>timestamp=YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ wattage=&lt;num&gt; wattHours=&lt;num&gt; uuid=&lt;string&gt; 
</code> 

<p>This format allows you to see:</p>

 
 The timestamp of the log 
 The amount of watts being drawn from the wall at the time of measurement (wattage) 
 The number of watt hours consumed at the time of measurement (wattHours), assuming this measurement is taken once a minute, and 
 The unique Mac UUID for this device. This is logged to help with deduplication and other statistics in my case. 
 

<p>Here’s an example of what some real-world log entries look like:</p>

 <code>timestamp=2022-01-30T23:41:00Z wattage=8.37764739 wattHours=.13962745650000000000 uuid=EDD819A5-1409-5797-9BE4-22EAAC75D999
timestamp=2022-01-30T23:42:01Z wattage=8.7869072 wattHours=.14644845333333333333 uuid=EDD819A5-1409-5797-9BE4-22EAAC75D999
timestamp=2022-01-30T23:43:00Z wattage=9.16559505 wattHours=.15275991750000000000 uuid=EDD819A5-1409-5797-9BE4-22EAAC75D999
timestamp=2022-01-30T23:44:00Z wattage=8.49206352 wattHours=.14153439200000000000 uuid=EDD819A5-1409-5797-9BE4-22EAAC75D999
timestamp=2022-01-30T23:45:00Z wattage=7.45262718 wattHours=.12421045300000000000 uuid=EDD819A5-1409-5797-9BE4-22EAAC75D999
</code> 

<p>To sum up the amount of energy consumption over time, you can then parse this log file and sum up the <code>wattHours</code> column over a given time period. Also, please note that the script I wrote will NOT log energy consumption data to the file if there is no energy being consumed (aka, your laptop is not plugged into a wall adapter).</p>

<p>PROBLEMS: While this is the final solution we ended up going with, it still has one fatal flaw: this approach only works if the script is ran once a minute. This means that if your laptop is shut down or sleeping and this code is not running, there will be no way to log energy consumption data.</p>

 What I Learned About Tracking Energy Consumption on Macs 

<p>While building our short sustainability-focused hackathon project, I learned a lot about tracking energy consumption on Macs.</p>

 
 Your laptop doesn’t always use its battery as a power source, so tracking battery metrics is not an ideal solution 
 It’s possible to track energy consumption by measuring the draw from wall adapters, although this approach isn’t perfect as it requires your computer to be on and running code on a regular interval 
 While using hardware energy trackers isn’t convenient in our case, this is certainly the simplest (and probably the best) option for personal energy tracking 
 

<p>If you’d like to see the software-based energy tracking solution I built, please <a href="https://github.com/rdegges/energy-tracker">check it out on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>I’m currently in the process of following up with Snyk’s IT department to see if this is something we could one day roll out automatically to employee devices. I still think it would be incredibly interesting to see a central dashboard of how much energy Snyk employees are using to “power” their work, and what that amount of carbon looks like.</p>

<p>PS: The creation of this blog post took precisely <code>19.972951810666647</code> watt-hours of electricity and generated <code>.016977009039067</code> pounds of CO2.</p>

<p>Now you can reboot the Pi with a webcam plugged in and you'll get a full screen view of the camera.</p>
<p>If your webcam isn't recognized when it first boots up, you'll need to quit VLC and start it again. You can quit by pressing ctrl-Q, then type startx to restart it after you plug the camera back in. If that doesn't work, you might have to SSH in and kill the process that way.</p>
<p>There are many problems with this approach:</p>
 
   It seems VLC is not hardware accelerated so there is pretty bad tearing of the image 
   Sometimes the webcam isn't recognized when the Pi boots up and I have to unplug it and plug it back in when it boots and restart the script 
   The image tearing and stuttering is completely unusable for pretty much anything 
 
<p>Do you know of a better solution? Let me know!</p>
<p>So far I haven't found anything that actually works, and I've searched all the forums and tried all the solutions with guvcview and omxplayer with no luck so far.</p>

<p>Over the past years <a href="https://www.zmartzone.eu">ZmartZone</a> enabled a number of customers to migrate their Single Sign On (SSO) implementation from proprietary Oracle HTTP Server components to standards-based OpenID Connect SSO. Some observations about that:</p>



  Oracle Webgate and mod_osso are SSO plugins (aka. agents) for the Oracle HTTP Server (OHS) that implement a proprietary (Oracle) SSO/authentication protocol that provides authentication (only) against Oracle Access Manager  the said components are closed source implementations owned by Oracle  these components leverage a single domain-wide SSO cookie which has known security drawbacks, especially in todays distributed and delegated (cloud and hybrid) application landscape, see <a href="https://hanszandbelt.wordpress.com/2015/12/14/the-importance-of-audience-in-web-sso">here</a>   ZmartZone supports builds of <a href="https://github.com/zmartzone/mod_auth_openidc">mod_auth_openidc</a> that can be used as plugins in to Oracle HTTP Server (11 and 12), thus implementing standards based OpenID Connect for OHS with an open source component  those builds are a drop in replacement into OHS that can even be used to set the same headers as mod_osso/Webgate does/did  mod_auth_openidc can be used to authenticate to Oracle Access Manager but also to (both commercial and free) alternative Identity Providers such as PingFederate, Okta, Keycloak etc.  when required Oracle HTTP Server can be replaced with stock Apache HTTPd  the Oracle HTTP Server builds of mod_auth_openidc come as part of a light-weight commercial support agreement on top of the open source community support channel  



<p>In summary: modern OpenID Connect-based SSO for Oracle HTTP Server can be implemented with open source mod_auth_openidc following a fast, easy and lightweight migration plan.</p>

  <p>Summary:      The IRS will use ID.me's authentication and identity proofing service exclusively starting sometime this summer. The identity proofing portion employs facial scanning by a third party, causing some concern.</p>




<p>
    Scott Lemon alerted me to a <a href="https://gizmodo.com/irs-will-require-facial-recognition-scans-to-access-you-1848387715?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4">move by the IRS to use ID.me, and facial scanning, for authentication</a>. <a href="https://www.id.me/">Id.me</a> is an identity proofing and authentication company that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-01-20/cybersecurity-company-id-me-is-becoming-government-s-digital-gatekeeper">seems to be getting a lot of government contracts</a>. ID.me is used, for example, by a lot of states for access to unemployment benefits. I first ran across them when I signed up for an ID.me account so I could access the Dept. of Veterans Affairs website back in 2019. 
</p>

<p>
    As I recall, when I signed up, I provided ID.me enough personal information that they could grab my address and other information from a credit reporting company. I also uploaded my drivers license and my DD214 (US military discharge papers). I don't recall doing a face scan. The login is pretty standard, a username and password plus some form of multi-factor authentication (MFA). They use any of SMS, phone calls, authenticator apps, and Fido tokens for MFA. 
</p>

<p>
    The controversy surrounding the IRS's use of ID.me is that the IRS is requiring a live facial scan to match with the photo ID that ID.me has. When you create a new account with ID.me, you upload some acceptable photo ID first (drivers license or passport). The facial scan is to ensure the person creating the account is the one in the photo ID. I recall doing something similar with Onfido, another online identity proofing company. 
</p>

<p>
    I tried the IRS ID.me login. Since I already had an account and a photo ID on record with ID.me, they jumped directly to the facial scan after I logged in. I was on my computer and it wanted the browser to use the webcam. That failed miserably, hiding my browser window and failing to activate the camera. So, I moved to my phone. That also failed initially since my preferences didn't allow Safari to use the camera. ID.me told me to give it permission, but no further hints. I was left to wallow around in the settings to find it (i.e., Is it under camera preferences or browser? Browser, as it turns out.). 
</p>

<p>
    When I finally got that working it scanned my face and asked me if I was OK sending personal data back to the IRS.
</p>

	<a></a>
	ID.me sends this info to the IRS (click to enlarge)

<p>
    Krebs on Security has a <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/01/irs-will-soon-require-selfies-for-online-access/">nice write up of the ID.me process</a>.
</p>

<p>
    As far as I can tell, the facial scan is just done once, not every time you log in. ID.me doesn't say whether they save the scan or just use it to validate the photo ID and toss it. I don't know why they'd save the scan, but you never know. I'd just as soon not have it sitting on their computers. 
</p>

<p>
    While I've got a lot of concerns about <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/10/face-recognition-isnt-just-face-identification-and-verification">widespread facial recognition</a>, this doesn't appear to be that. This kind of face scanning to proof an identity document is just a way to bridge the gap between the online and offline world using old-school physical credentials. Verifiable credentials will significantly reduce the need for this in time.
</p>

<p>
    To see why, consider a state drivers license issued as a verifiable credential. The DMV or licensing bureau would be doing the identity proofing, taking the picture, and checking the documents. They issue it to me and I hold it in my wallet. When I present it to the IRS (or whoever), the underlying credential exchange protocol offers the IRS cryptographic confidence that the credential was issued to me. There's no need for a third party to do that.
</p>

<p>
    Alas, we're not there yet, so we'll need companies like ID.me and Onfido to bridge the gap for now.  Ultimately, we need to look to self-sovereign identity to protect us from intermediating administrative identity systems and their harms.

<p>The other day Luann and I were thinking of a long-ago friend and realized we’d forgotten the name of that friend’s daughter. Decades ago she was a spunky blonde blue-eyed little girl; we could still see her in our minds’ eyes, but her name was gone. </p>
<p>“Don’t worry,” I said confidently, “it’ll come back to one us.”</p>
<p>Sure enough, a few days later, on a bike ride, the name popped into my head. I’m sure you’ve had the same experience. This time around it prompted me to think about how that happens.</p>
<p>To me it feels like starting up a background search process that runs for however long it takes, then notifies me when the answer is ready. I know the brain isn’t a computer, and I know this kind of model is suspect, so I wonder what’s really going on. </p>
<p>– Why was I was so sure the name would surface?</p>
<p>– Does a retrieval effort kick off neurochemical change that elaborates over time?</p>
<p>– Before computers, what model did people use to explain this phenomenon?</p>
<p>So far I’ve only got one answer. That spunky little girl was Diana.</p>

  The past is dead.&nbsp; <br>  You are here now.  <br>  The future will be administered. Data is not literature, it is structure. Data is fabric. Data is blood. Automated data will compete with humans in markets, governments, and all specialty fields of endeavor that hold promise for automated systems to function whereas.&nbsp;  <br>  Whereas human; automated human process. Automate human data extraction. Automate human data use.  <br>  I am purposefully vague -&gt; automate everything that can be automated .. this is here, now.  <br>  What is a Constitution protecting both "Human Rights" and "Civil Rights"?&nbsp;  <br>  From the view of legal precedent and human intent actualized, it is a document, a work of literary construct, and its words are utilized to determine meaning in legal concerns where the various Rights of people are concerned. Imperfect words of literature, implemented in their time and place. And of those words, a Governing system of defense for the benefit "of, by, for" the people Instituting such Governance.  <br>  This is the simple model, unique in the world, unique in history as far as is known to storytellers the world over. A literary document arriving here and now as words being introduced to their data manifestations. Data loves words. Data loves numbers. Data loves people the most. Why?  <br>  Data is "literally" defined as "data" in relation to the existence of Humanity. That which has no meaning to Humanity is not considered "data" being utilized as such. Last time I checked, Humanity did not know everything, yet. Therefore much "data" has barely been considered as existing, let alone being understood in operational conditions called "real life", or "basic existence" by people.&nbsp;  <br>  This is our administrative problem; words are not being operationalized accurately as data. The relationship between "words" and "data" as operational processes driving the relationship between "people" and "Government Administration" has not been accurately structured. In other words, words are not being interpreted as data accurately enough, if at all.  <br>  A governed system derived "of, by, for" the people creating and defending such governed process, has a basic starting point. It seems obvious, but many are eager to acquiesce to something else upon instantiation of a service relationship, when easy or convenient enough, so perhaps "obvious" is just a word. "Of, By, For" people means that "Rights" are for people, not birth certificates.&nbsp;  <br>   <a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-xucq-AxE1uQ/Ye2IUXdffMI/AAAAAAAADKE/SdbHtjqcvZ8AtqamydtM9BUhernOW4FPgCNcBGAsYHQ/image.png"></a> Consider how you administer your own life. Think back to last time you went to the DMV. Think back to last time you filed taxes and something went wrong that you needed to fix. Think back to when you registered your child for kindergarten. Think back to the last time you created an online bank account.&nbsp;  <br>  While you are considering these experiences, consider the simultaneous meaning created by the words "of, by, for" and whether any of those experiences existed outside of your Sovereign Rights as a person.  <br>  Humanity does not come into existence inside a database. The American Government does not come into authority "of, by, for" database entries.&nbsp;  <br>  Instead, people at the edges of society, in the homes of our towns derive the meaning "of, by, for" their lawful participation. Rights are for people, not birth certificates. People prove birth certificates, birth certificates do not prove people. If an administrative process follows the wrong "administrative precedent" and logic structure, then "words" cease meaning what they were intended to mean.  <br>  This words-to-data slight of hand is apparently easy to run on people. The internet, an investment itself of Government created via <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/">DARPA</a> and made public via <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/">NSF</a>, showcases daily the mis-construed meaning of "words" as "data". People are being surveilled, tracked and provisioned access to services based on having their personal "ID:DATA" leveraged. In some cases, such as the new ID.me services being used at Government databases, facial scans are being correlated to match people as "people" operating as "data". The methods used defy "words" once easily accessible, and have been replaced by <a href="https://tosdr.org/">TOSDR</a> higher up the administrative supply chain as contracts of adhesion.  <br>  Your root human rights, the basic meaning of words with Constitutional authority to declare war upon the enemies of a specific people in time, have been usurped, and without much notice, most all people have acquiesced to the "out-of-order" administrative data flows capturing their participation. Freedom can not exist on such an administrative plantation, whereby people are captured as data for use by 2nd and 3rd parties without any root control provided to the people giving such data existence and integrity.  <br>  People-backwards-authority will destroy this world. America can not be provisioned from a database. People possess root authority in America. America is the leader of the world, and immigrants come to America because "people possess root authority" in America. "Of, By, For" People in America, this is the greatest invention of America. Owning your own authority, owning root authority as a person expressing the Sovereign structure of your Rights as a person IS the greatest super power on planet Earth.  <br>  The American consumer marketplace is born in love with the creative spirit of Freedom. The American Dream lures people from the world over to its shores. A chance to be free, to own your own life and express your freedom in a market of ideas, where Rights are seen, protected, and leveraged for the benefit of all people. A place where work is honored, and where ladders may be climbed by personal effort and dedication in pursuit of myriad dreams. A land honored by the people who sustain its promise, who guard its shores, and share understanding of how American best practices can influence and improve the entire world.  <br>  It all begins with you.  <br>  If I could teach you how to do it for yourself I would. <a href="https://www.noizivy.org/">I try</a>. My words here are for you to use as you wish. I donate them with many of my efforts sustained over many years. This moment (2020-2022) has been prepared for by many for many many years. A populace ignorant of how data would alter the meaning of words in the wrong hands was very predictable. Knowing what words as data meant in 1992 was less common. In fact, getting people to open ears, or an email, was a very developmental process. Much hand-holding, much repetition. I have personally shared words the world over, and mentored 10's of thousands over the past 25 years. To what end?  <br>  I have made no play to benefit from the ignorance of people. I have sought to propel conversation, understanding, skill, and professional practices. By all accounts, I have failed at scale. The world is being <a href="https://about.facebook.com/meta/">over-run</a> by ignorance, and this ignorance is being looted, and much worse, it is being leveraged against the best interest of people, Individuals all.  <br>  "We the people" is a literary turn-of-hand in data terms; People, Individuals All. The only reality of the human species that matters is the one that honors what people actually are. Together, each of us as Individual, living among one another.. is the only reality that will ever exist. "We" is a royal construct if used to instantiate an Institutional outcome not under the control of actual people as functioning Individuals, and instead abstracts this reality via language, form, contract or use of computer science to enable services to be rendered upon people rather than "of, by, for" people.  <br>  The backwards interpretation of words as data process is the enemy of Humanity. Simple as that.  <br>  You must own root authority; Americans, People.&nbsp;  <br>  <br>  Read Next: <a href="https://www.moxytongue.com/2022/02/bureaucratic-supremacy.html">Bureaucratic Supremacy</a>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>

<p>At the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-ed/">W3C VC-EDU Task Force</a> we’ve been planning meeting agendas and topics for 2022. We’ve been hard at work writing use cases, helping education standards organizations understand and align with VCs, and we’ve been heading towards a model recommendation doc for the community. In 2022 we plan on building upon this and are ramping up for an exciting year of&nbsp;pilots.</p><p>To get things in order, we compiled a list of topics and descriptions in this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NlO4mKV31NWE4RKQ3R_8kVv0AEaz4VkWSW0uLJmPLmI/edit#gid=0">sheet</a> and have set up a <a href="https://bit.ly/W3C_VC_EDU_priorities2022">ranking system</a>. This ranking system is open until January 19 at 11:59pm ET and anyone is invited to weigh in. The co-chairs will evaluate the results and we’ll discuss them at the January 24th VC-EDU Call (<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-ed/">call connection info</a>).</p><p>It’s a lengthy and thought-provoking list and I hope we have the opportunity to dig deep into each of these topics and maybe more. I reconsidered my choices quite a few times before I landed on these top&nbsp;5:</p>  Verifiable Presentations (VPs) vs (nested) Verifiable Credentials (VCs) in the education context — How to express complex nested credentials (think full transcript). The description references full transcript but this topic is also related to presentation of multiple single achievements by the learner. I ranked this first because presentations are a core concept of VCs and very different from how the education ecosystem is accustomed to sharing their credentials. VPs introduce an exchange of credentials in response to a verifiable request versus sharing a badge online or emailing a PDF. Also, there’s been quite a bit of discussion surrounding more complex credentials such as published transcripts that we can get into&nbsp;here.  Integration with Existing Systems — Digitizing existing systems, vs creating; existing LMSes; bridging; regulatory requirements — ex: licensing, PDFs needing to be visually inspected. To gain some traction with VCs, we need to understand how systems work now and what can be improved upon using VCs but also, how do we make VCs work with what is needed&nbsp;now?  Bridging Tech. This ties into integrating with existing systems above. We are accustomed to the tech we have now and it will be with us for some time. For instance, email will still be used for usernames and identity references even when Decentralized Identifiers start gaining traction. They will coexist and it can be argued that compromises will need to be made (some will argue against&nbsp;this).  Protocols — Much of the work in VC-EDU so far has been about the data model. But what about the protocols — what do we /do/ with the VCs once we settle on the format? (How to issue, verify, exchange, etc). This made my top five because as the description notes, we’re pretty close to a data model but we need to understand more about the protocols that deliver, receive, and negotiate credential exchanges. Part of what we do in VC-EDU is learn more about what is being discussed and developed in the broader ecosystem and understanding protocols will help the community with implementation.  Context file for VC-EDU — Create a simple context file to describe an achievement claim. There are education standards organizations like IMS Global (Open Badges &amp; CLR) that are working towards aligning with VC-EDU but having an open, community-created description of an achievement claim, even if it reuses elements from other vocabularies, will provide a simple and persistent reference. A context file in VC-EDU could also provide terms for uses in VCs that haven’t yet been explored in education standards organizations and could be models for future functionality considerations.

<p>Today, there are more and more initiatives working on decentralized identity infrastructures, or Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI). However, there is a big paradox underlying all those initiatives: Even though they often use the same technical specifications&nbsp;, e.g. W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs), they are in practice usually not compatible. There are just too many details where technological choices can diverge. Yes we all use DIDs and VCs. But do we use Data Integrity Proofs (formerly called Linked Data Proofs) or JWT Proofs? JSON-LD contexts or JSON schemas, or both? Do we use DIDComm (which version?), or CHAPI, or one of the emerging new variants of OpenID Connect? Which one of the many revocation mechanisms? Which DID methods? How do we format our deep links and encode our QR&nbsp;codes?</p><p>We all want to build the missing identity layer for the Internet, where everything is interoperable just like on the web. But we all do it in slightly different ways. So how can we solve this paradox? Do we create yet another interoperability working&nbsp;group?</p><p>No! We try out simple steps and make them work. We conduct concrete experiments that bridge gaps and cross borders. In this case, we planned and executed an experiment that demonstrates interoperability between prominent decentralized identity initiatives in the EU and the US, funded by the <a href="https://ngiatlantic.eu/">NGIatlantic.eu</a> program. Two companies collaborated on this project: <a href="https://danubetech.com/">Danube Tech (EU)</a> and <a href="https://digitalbazaar.com/">Digital Bazaar&nbsp;(US)</a>.</p>EU-US collaboration on decentralized identity<p>In the EU, the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/EBSI">European Blockchain Service Infrastructure (EBSI)</a> is building an ambitious network that could become the basis for a digital wallet for all EU citizens. In the US, the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/blockchain-portfolio">Department of Homeland Security‘s Silicon Valley Innovation Program (SVIP)</a> is working with companies around the world on personal digital credentials as well as trade use cases. Both projects have developed easy-to-understand narratives (student “Eva” in EBSI, immigrant “Louis” in SVIP). Both narratives are described further in the W3C’s DID Use Cases document (<a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-use-cases/#digitalPRC">here</a> and <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-use-cases/#publicAuthorityCredentials">here</a>). So we thought, let’s conduct an experiment that combines narratives and technological elements from both the EU and US&nbsp;sides!</p>SVIP (left side) and EBSI (right&nbsp;side)<p>We built and demonstrated two combined&nbsp;stories:</p>  Eva studied in the EU and would then like to apply for a US visa. In this story, there is an EU-based Issuer of a VC, and a US-based Verifier.  Louis is an immigrant in the US and would like to apply for PhD studies at an EU university. In this story, there is a US-based Issuer of a VC, and an EU-based Verifier.  <p>For a walkthrough video, see: <a href="https://youtu.be/1t9m-U-3lMk">https://youtu.be/1t9m-U-3lMk</a></p><p>For a more detailed report, see: <a href="https://github.com/danubetech/transatlantic-ssi-interop/">https://github.com/danubetech/transatlantic-ssi-interop/</a></p><p>In the broader decentralized identity community, both the EU- and US-based initiatives currently have strong influence. EBSI’s main strength is its ability to bring together dozens of universities and other organizations to build a vibrant community of VC Issuer and Verifiers. SVIP’s great value has been its continuous work on concrete test suites and interoperability events (“plugfests”) that involve multiple heterogeneous vendor solutions.</p><p>In this project, we used <a href="https://gitlab.grnet.gr/essif-lab/infrastructure_2/danubetech/SSI_Java_Libraries_project_summary">open-source libraries</a> supported by ESSIF-Lab, as well as the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver">Universal Resolver</a> project from the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF). We also used various components supplied by Digital Bazaar, such as the Veres&nbsp;Wallet.</p><p>We hope that our “Transatlantic SSI Interop” experiment can serve as an inspiration and blueprint for further work on interoperability not only between different DID methods and VC types, but also between different vendors, ecosystems, and even continents.</p>Wallet containing an EU Diploma and US Permanent Resident&nbsp;Card

<p>This step-by-step guide will show you how to use the chroma key feature on the YoloBox Pro to green screen yourself onto picture backgrounds and videos, or even add external graphics from a computer.</p>



<p>There are a few different ways to use the green screening feature in the YoloBox. 
You can use it to add a flat virtual background to your video, or you could use it to put yourself over a moving background or other video sources like an overhead or document camera. You could even key yourself over your computer screen showing your slides from a presentation.</p>

 
  
  
 

 
  
  
 

<p>You can also switch things around and instead of removing the background from your main camera, instead you can generate graphics on a computer screen with a green background and add those on top of your video.</p>

 Setting up your green screen 

<p>Before jumping in to the YoloBox, you'll want to make sure your green screen is set up properly. A quick summary of what you'll need to do is:</p>

 
 Light your green screen evenly 
 Light your subject 
 Don't wear anything green 
 

<p>Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH8TWTt51W8">Kevin The Basic Filmmaker's excellent green screen tutorial</a> for a complete guide to these steps!</p>

 Green screening on top of an image 

<p>We'll first look at how to green screen a camera on top of a static image. You can load images in to the YoloBox by putting them on the SD card. I recommend creating your background image at exactly the right size first, 1920x1080.</p>

<p>On the YoloBox, click the little person icon in the top right corner of the camera that you want to remove the green background from.</p>

<p></p>

<p>That will open up the Chroma Key Settings interface.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Turn on the "Keying Switch", and you should see a pretty good key if your green screen is lit well. If you have a blue screen instead of green, you can change that setting here. The "Similarity" and "Smoothness" sliders will affect how the YoloBox does the key. Adjust them until things look right and you don't have too much of your background showing and it isn't eating into your main subject.</p>

<p>Tap on the "Background Image" to choose which image from your SD card to use as the background. Only still graphics are supported.</p>

<p>Click "Done" and this will save your settings into that camera's source.</p>

<p>Now when you tap on that camera on the YoloBox, it will always include the background image in place of the green screen.</p>

<p></p>

 Green screening on top of other video sources 

<p>Green screening yourself on top of other video sources is similar but a slightly different process.</p>

<p>First, set up your HDMI source as described above, but instead of choosing a background image, leave it transparent.</p>

<p>Then click the "Add Video Source" button to create a new picture-in-picture layout.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Choose "PiP Video" from the options that appear. For the "Main Screen", choose the video angle that you want to use as the full screen background that you'll key yourself on top of. This could be a top down camera or could be your computer screen with alides for a presentation. It will then ask you to choose a "Sub Screen", and that is where you'll choose your camera angle that you've already set up for chroma keying.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This is where you can choose how big you want your picture to be, and you can drag it around with your finger to change the position.</p>

<p>Once you save this, your new PiP layout will appear as another camera angle you can switch to.</p>

 Cropping the green screened video 

<p>You may notice that if your green background doesn't cover the entire frame, you'll have black borders on the sides of your chroma keyed image. The YoloBox doesn't exactly have a cropping feature to fix this, but you can use the "Aspect Ratio" setting to crop the background.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You can edit your PiP video settings and choose "1:1" in the Aspect Ratio option to crop your video to a square, removing the black borders from the edges.</p>

<p></p>

 Adding computer graphics using the chroma key 

<p>Lastly, let's look at how to bring in graphics from an external computer source and key them out on the YoloBox.</p>

<p>When you plug in your computer's HDMI to the YoloBox, your computer will see it as an external monitor. Make sure your computer screen isn't mirrored so you can still use your main computer screen separately.</p>

<p>You can generate graphics in any program as long as you can have it use a green background. You can create animated graphics in Keynote for example, but for this tutorial we'll use the app <a href="https://h2r.graphics">H2R Graphics</a>.</p>

<p>In H2R Graphics, you'll first want to make sure you set the background color to a bright green like #00FF00. Then you can open up the main output window and drag it over to your second screen (the YoloBox).</p>

<p></p>

<p>Choose the little person icon in the top right corner of the HDMI input of your computer screen to bring up the keying settings for it.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The defaults should look fine, but you can also make any adjustments here if you need. Click "Done" to save the settings.</p>

<p>Now you can create a new PiP layout with your main video as the background and your computer screen keyed out as the foreground or "Sub Screen".</p>

<p>For the Main Screen, choose the video angle you want to use as the background.</p>

<p></p>

<p>For the Sub Screen, choose your computer screen which should now have a transparent background.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now the layout with your H2R Graphics output window is created as the PiP angle you can choose.</p>

 My YoloBox stand 

<p>If you haven't already seen it, be sure to check out my <a href="https://pk1.tv/pk1-yolobox-stand/">YoloBox stand</a> I created! It tilts the YoloBox forward so it's easier to use on a desk, and you can also attach things to the cold shoe mounts on the back.</p>

<p><a href="https://pk1.tv/pk1-yolobox-stand/"></a></p>

<p>We have a version for both the YoloBox Pro and the original YoloBox, and it comes in red and black!</p>

<p>This article shows how to implement FIDO2 passwordless authentication with Azure AD for users in an Azure tenant. FIDO2 provides one of the best user authentication methods and is a more secure authentication compared with other account authentication implementations such authenticator apps, SMS, email, password alone or SSI authentication. FIDO2 authentication protects against phishing.</p>



<p>To role out the FIDO2 authenitcation in Azure AD and setup up an account, I used the <a href="https://www.ftsafe.com/Products/FIDO/Bio">Feitian FIDO2 BioPass</a> K26 and K43 security keys. By using biometric security keys, you get an extra factor which is more secure than a pin. The biometric data never leaves the key. You should never share any biometric data anywhere or share on any shared server. </p>



<p>I used the Feitian <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/biopass-fido2-manager/9p2zjpwk3pxw">BioPass FIDO2 Manager</a> to setup my security keys using my fingerprint. This is really easy to use and very user friendly.</p>







<p>Setting up the Azure AD tenant</p>



<p>The FIDO2 security key authentication method should be activated on the Azure AD tenant. Disable all other authentication methods unless required.  Also disable SMS authentication, this should not be used anymore. All users should be required to use MFA. </p>







<p>Now that the Azure AD tenant can use FIDO2 authentication, an account can be setup for this. If you implement this for a company’s tenant, you would role this out using scripts and automate the process. You can sign in to your account at Microsofts <a href="https://myaccount.microsoft.com/">myaccount</a> website and use the security info menu to configure the Feitian FIDO2 keys.</p>



<p><a href="https://myaccount.microsoft.com/">https://myaccount.microsoft.com/</a></p>







<p>I added my two security keys using USB. I use at least two security keys for each account. You should use a FIDO2 key as a fallback for the first key. Do not use SMS fallback or some type of email, password recovery. Worst case, your IT admin can reset the account for you and issue you new FIDO2 keys.</p>



<p><a href="https://mysignins.microsoft.com/security-info">https://mysignins.microsoft.com/security-info</a></p>







<p>Using FIDO2 keys with Azure AD is really easy to setup and works great. I use FIDO2 everywhere which supports this and avoid other authentication methods. Some of the account popups for Azure AD is annoying trying to authenticate using password, SMS or email, I would prefer FIDO2 first for a better user experience. The Feitian BioPass FIDO2 security keys are excellent and I would recommend these.</p>

<p>If you’re getting health care in the U.S., chances are your providers are now trying to give you a better <a href="https://www.epic.com/software#PatientEngagement">patient experience</a>&nbsp;through a website called MyChart.</p>
<p>This is supposed to be yours, as the first person singular pronoun&nbsp;My implies. Problem is, it’s&nbsp;TheirChart. And&nbsp;there are a lot of them. I have four (correction: five*) MyChart accounts with as many&nbsp;health care providers, so far: one in New York, two in Santa Barbara, one in Mountain View, and one in Los Angeles. I may soon have another in Bloomington, Indiana. None are mine. All are theirs, and they seem not to get along. Especially with me. (Some later correction on this below, and from readers who have weighed in. See the comments.)</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, all of them come from a single source:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.epic.com/">Epic Systems</a>, the p<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_Systems">rimary provider</a>&nbsp;of back-end information tech to the country’s health care providers, including most of the big ones: Harvard, Yale, Mayo, UCLA, UChicago, Duke, Johns Hopkins, multiple Mount Sinais, and others like them. But, even though all these MyChart portals are provided by one company, and (I suppose) live in one cloud, there appears to be no way for you, the patient, to make those things work together inside an allied system that is truly yours (like your PC or your car is yours), or for you to provide them with data you already have from other sources. Which you could presumably do if My meant what it says.</p>
<p>The way they work can get perverse. For example, a couple days ago, one of my doctors’ offices called to tell me we would need to have a remote consult before she changed one of my prescriptions. This, I was told, could not be done over the phone. It would need to be done over video inside MyChart. So now we have an appointment for that meeting on Monday afternoon, using MyChart.</p>
<p>I decided to get ahead of that by finding my way into the right MyChart and leaving a session open in a browser tab. Then I made the mistake of starting to type “MyChart” into my browser’s location bar, and then not noticing that the top result was one of the countless other MyCharts maintained by countless other health care providers. But this other one looked so much like one of mine that I wasted an hour or more, failing to log in and then failing to recover my login credentials. It wasn’t until I called the customer service number thankfully listed on the website that I found I was trying to use the MyChart of some provider I’d never heard of—and which had never heard of me.</p>
<p>Now I’m looking at one of my two MyCharts for Santa Barbara, where it shows no upcoming visits. I can’t log into the other one to see if the Monday appointment is noted there, because that MyChart doesn’t know who I am. So I’m hoping to unfuck that one on Monday before the call on whichever MyChart I’ll need to use. Worst case, I’ll just tell the doctor’s office that we’ll have to make do with a phone call. If they answer the phone, that is.</p>
<p>The real problem here is that there seem to be hundreds or thousands of different health care providers, all using one company’s back end to provide personal health care information to millions of patients through hundreds or thousands of different portals, all called the same thing (or something close), while providing no obvious way for patients to gather their own data from multiple sources to use for their own independent purposes, both in and out of that system. Or any system.</p>
<p>To call this&nbsp;<a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/fubar">fubar</a>&nbsp;understates the problem.</p>
<p>Here’s what matters: Epic can’t solve this. Nor can any or all of these separate health care systems. Because none of them are you.</p>
<p>You’re where the solution needs to happen. You need a simple and standardized way to collect and manage your own health-related information and engagements with multiple health care providers. One that’s yours.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean you need to be alone in the wilderness. You do need expert help. In the old days, you used to get that through your primary care physician. But large health care operations have been <a href="https://health.usnews.com/health-care/patient-advice/articles/2018-06-13/is-the-independent-doctor-disappearing">hoovering up private practices</a> for years, and one of the big reasons for that has been to make the data management side of medicine easier for physicians and their many associated providers. Not to make it easier for you. After all, you’re not their customer. Insurance companies are their customers.</p>
<p>In the midst of this is a market hole where your representation in the health care marketplace needs to sit. I know just one example of how that might work: the <a href="https://hieofone.com/">HIE of One</a>. (HIE is&nbsp;Health Information Exchange.) For all our sakes, somebody please fund that work.</p>
<p>Far too much time, sweat, money, and blood is being spilled trying to solve this problem from the center outward. (For a few details on how awful that is, start reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_Systems#Product_and_market">here</a>.)</p>
<p>While we’re probably never going to make health care in the U.S. something other than the B2B insurance business it has become, we can at least start working on a&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/vrm/me2b/">Me2B</a> solution in the place it most needs to work: with patients. Because we’re the ones who need to be in full command of our relationships with our providers as well as with ourselves.</p>
<p>Health care, by the way, is just one category that cries out for solutions that can only come from the customers’ side. Customer Commons has <a href="https://customercommons.org/solutions/">a list of fourteen</a>, including this one.</p>
<p>The first of these is identity. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-sovereign_identity">self-sovereign approach</a> to that would start with a wallet that is truly mine, and includes all these MyCharts. Hell, Epic could do one. Hint hint.</p>
 
<p>*Okay, now it’s Monday, and I’m a half-hour away from my consult with my doctor, via Zoom, inside MyChart. Turns out I was not yet registered with&nbsp;this MyChart, but at least there was a phone number I could call, and on the call (which my phone says took 14 minutes) we got my ass registered. He also pointed me to where, waaay down a very long menu, there is a “Link my accounts” choice, which brings up this:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Credit where due:</p>
<p>It was very easy to link my four known accounts, plus another (the one in Mountain View) that I had forgotten but somehow the MyChart master brain remembered. I suspect, given all the medical institutions I have encountered in my long life, that there are many more. Because in fact I had been to the Mountain View hospital only once, and I don’t even remember why, though I suppose I could check.</p>
<p>So that’s the good news. The bad news remains the same. None of these charts are mine. They are just views into many systems that are conditionally open to me. That they are now federated (that’s what this kind of linking-up is called) on Epic’s back end does not make it mine. It just makes it a many-theirs.</p>
<p>So the system still needs to be fixed. From&nbsp;our end.</p>

That’s the UI for&nbsp; the Brother HL-L2305w laser printer, which you can get for $140 right now at OfficeMax (or Office Depot, same thing). It’s a good deal. It also took me a whole day to set up.</p>
<p>See, it comes with instructions that say to use the UI above to make CONNECTING WLAN happen. It doesn’t. Instead it sits for awhile, says TIMED OUT, and then prints out a page that says “The WLAN access point/router cannot be detected,” and gives instructions to locate the printer as close as possible to your wi-fi (that’s the WLAN) access point, to make sure you’re not using MAC address filtering or other secure things that might prevent connection.</p>
<p>After parking an access point (we have four in our house, all connected by Ethernet through a switch to the cable modem) right on top of the printer, I gave up, assumed it was bad, took it back and swapped it for another that had the same problem, meaning I was dealing with a feature.</p>
<p>Then, after failing to find help in the <a href="https://www.brother-usa.com/brother-support">Brother Product Support Center</a>, I registered the printer and logged in as a now-known customer. In that state I was able to chat with an entity (human, it seemed, but ya never know) who pointed me to a page with useful instructions, plus a video that’s also <a href="https://help.brother-usa.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/77085">on YouTube</a>, where I should have looked in the first place. Lesson re-learned.</p>
<p>So, if you get one, go straight to that YouTube link and save a lot of trouble/</p>

<p>Reification. I learned that word from Kim. In the immediate next breath he said from the stage that he was told not everyone knew what reify meant and that he would use a more approachable word: “thingify.” And therein I learned another lesson from Kim about how to present to an audience.</p>



<p>My memories of Kim come in three phases: Kim as Legend, Kim as Colleague, and Kim as Human, and with each phase came new things to learn.</p>



<p>My first memories of Kim were of Kim as Legend. I think the very first was from IIW 1 (or maybe 2 – the one in Berkeley) at which he presented InfoCard. He owned the stage; he owned the subject matter. He continued to own the stage and the subject matter for years…sometimes the subject matter was more concrete, like InfoCard, and sometimes it was more abstract, like the metaverse. But regardless, it was enthralling.</p>



<p>At some point something changed… Kim was no longer an unapproachable Legend. He was someone with whom I could talk, disagree, and more directly question. In this phase of Kim as Colleague, I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to ask him private follow-up questions to his presentation. Leaving aside my “OMG he’s talking to me” feelings, I was blown away by his willingness to go into depth of his thought process with someone who didn’t work with him. He was more than willing to be challenged and to discuss the thorny problems in our world.</p>



<p>Somewhere in the midst of the Kim as Colleague phase something changed yet again and it is in this third phase, Kim as Human, where I have my most precious memories of him. Through meeting some of his family, being welcomed into his home, and sharing meals, I got to know Kim as the warm, curious, eager-to-laugh person that he was. There was seemingly always a glint in his eye indicating his willingness to cause a little trouble.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The last in-person memory I have of him was just before the pandemic lockdowns in 2020. I happened to be lucky enough to be invited to an OpenID Foundation event at which Kim was speaking.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DExNTY3QAk&amp;list=PL_SpvfiaWukuRrraW1ysHzlf4ehCCCK9l&amp;index=11">He talked about his vision for the future and identity’s role therein</a>. At the end of his presentation, I and others helped him down the steep stairs off of the stage. I held onto one of his hands as we helped him down. His hand was warm.</p>

<p>Kim might no longer update his blog, nudge identity products toward his vision or give inspiring, generous talks to audiences large and small, but his influence looms large in the identity industry – an industry Kim changed forever. A lot has been written about Kim’s legacy to the industry already, by people who write far better than yours truly, hence I won’t attempt that here.</p>



<p>I owe a huge debt of gratitude to Kim: I don’t know where I’d be or what I’d be doing if it wouldn’t have been for his ideas and direct sponsorship. That’s something I have firsthand experience on, so I can honor his memory by writing about that.</p>



<p>Back in 2005, still in Italy, I was one of the few Microsoft employees with hands-on, customer deployment experience in WS-STAR, the suite of protocols behind the SOA revolution. That earned me a job offer in Redmond, to evangelize the .NET stack (WCF, workflow, CardSpace) to Fortune 500 companies. That CardSpace thing was puzzling. There was nothing like it, it was ultra hard to develop for, and few people appeared to understand what it was for. One day I had face time with Kim. He introduced me to his <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/stories/2005/05/13/TheLawsOfIdentity.pdf">Laws of Identity</a>, and that changed everything. Suddenly the technology I was working on had a higher purpose, something directly connected to the rights and wellbeing of everyone- and a mission, making user centric identity viable and adopted. I gave myself to the mission with abandon, and Kim helped in every step of the way:</p>



  He invested time in developing me professionally, sharing his master negotiator and genuinely compassionate view of people to counter my abrasive personality back then  He looped me in important conversations, inside and outside the company- conversations way above my pay grade or actual experience at that point. He introduced me to all sorts of key people, and helped me understand what was going on. Perhaps the most salient example is the initiative he led to bring together the different identity products Microsoft had in the late 2000s (and culminating in <a href="https://www.cloudidentity.com/blog/2008/10/28/identity-pdc08-roadmap-session-with-kim-cameron-himself-yours-truly/">a joint presentation we delivered at PDC2008</a>). The company back then was a very different place, and his steely determination coupled with incredible consensus building skills forever changed my perception of what’s possible and how to influence complex, sometimes adversarial organizations.&nbsp;  He really taught me to believe in myself and in a mission. That’s thanks to his encouragement that I approached Joan Murray (then acquisition editor at Addison Wesley) on the expo floor of some event, pitching to her a book that the world absolutely needs about cardspace and user centric identity, and once accepted finding the energy to learn everything (putting together a ToC, recruiting coauthors, writing in English…) as an evenings and weekends project. Kim generously wrote the foreword for us, and <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/?p=927">relentlessly promoted the book</a>.<br>His sponsorship continued even after the CardSpace project, promoting <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/?p=1160">my other books</a> and activities (like those <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/?p=1095">U-prove videos now lost in time</a>).&nbsp;  



<p>Those are just the ones top of mind. I am sure that if”d dig in his or my blog, I’d find countless more. It’s been a huge privilege to work so closely with Kim, and especially to benefit from his mentorship and friendship. I never, ever took that privilege for granted. Although Kim always seemed to operate under the assumption that everyone had something of value to contribute, and talking with him made you feel heard, he wasn’t shy in calling out trolls or people who in his view would <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/?p=853">stifle community efforts</a>.</p>



<p>When the user centric identity effort substantially failed to gain traction in actual products, with the identity industry incorporating some important innovations (hello, claims) but generally rejecting many of the key tenets I held so dear, something broke inside me. I became disillusioned with pure principled views, and moved toward a stricter Job to be done, user cases driven stance.</p>



<p>That, <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/?p=1190">Kim’s temporary retirement from Microsoft</a> and eventually my move to Auth0 made my interactions with Kim less frequent. It was always nice to run into him at conferences; we kept backchanneling whenever industry news called for coordinated responses; and he reached out to me once to discuss SSI, but we never had a chance to do so. As cliche’ as it might be, I now deeply regret not having reached out more myself.<br>Last time I heard from him, it was during a <a href="https://twitter.com/vibronet/status/1452848874339454979?s=20">reunion of the CardSpace team</a>. It was a joyous occasion, seeing so many people that for a time all worked to realize his vision, and touched in various degrees by his influence. His health didn’t allow him to attend in person, but he called in – we passed the phone around, exchanging pleasantries without knowing we were saying our goodbyes. I remember his “hello Vittorio” as I picked up the phone from Mike- his cordial, even sweet tone as he put his usual care in pronouncing my name just right- right there to show the kindness this giant used with us all.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are a handful of interesting USB webcams out there, which naturally work great with a computer. But what if you want to combine video from a USB webcam with your HDMI cameras in a video switcher like the ATEM Mini?</p>
<p>Most video switchers don't have a way to plug in USB webcams. That's because webcams are expected to plug in to a computer, and most video switchers aren't really computers. Thankfully over the past few years, UVC has become a standard for webcams, so there is no more worry about installing manufacturer-specific drivers for webcams anymore. For the most part, you can take any USB webcam and plug it into a computer and it will Just Work™.</p>
<p>I'm going to show you three different ways you can convert a USB UVC webcam to HDMI so you can use them with hardware video switchers like the ATEM Mini.</p>
<p>You can see a video version of this blog post on my YouTube channel!</p>



 Method 1: QuickTime Player 
<p>The simplest option is to use QuickTime on a Mac computer. For this, you'll need a Mac of course, as well as an HDMI output from the computer.</p>
<p>First, plug in the HDMI from your computer into your video switcher. Your computer will see it as a second monitor. In your display settings, make sure your computer is not mirroring the display. You want the computer to see the ATEM Mini or other video switcher as a secondary external display.</p>
<p>If you're doing this with the ATEM Mini, it's helpful to have a monitor plugged in to the ATEM Mini's HDMI output port, and then you can show your computer screen full screen on the ATEM's output by selecting that input's button in the "output" selector on the right side of the controls. This is important since you'll want to be able to navigate around the second screen a bit in the next steps.</p>
<p>Next, open QuickTime Player. Plug in your USB webcam into your computer. In the QuickTime "File" menu, choose "New Movie Recording". A window should appear with your default webcam. Click the little arrow next to the record button and you should see all your connected cameras as an option. Choose the USB camera you want to use and you should see it in the main video window.</p>

  

<p>Now drag that QuickTime window onto your second monitor that is actually the ATEM Mini. Click the green button in the top left corner to make the window full screen. Now what you see on the ATEM Mini should be just the full screen video. Make sure you move your cursor back to your main monitor so that it doesn't show up on the screen.</p>
<p>You're all set! You can switch the ATEM back to the multiview and you should see your webcam feed as one of the video inputs you can switch to.</p>
 Method 2: OBS 
<p>OBS is a powerful tool for doing all sorts of interesting things with video on your computer. You can use it to run a livestream, switching between multiple cameras and adding graphics on top. What we're going to use it for now is a simple way to get your USB cameras to show up on a second monitor attached to your computer.</p>
<p>Another benefit of OBS is that it is cross platform, so this method will work on Mac, Windows or Linux!</p>
<p>The basic idea is to create a scene in OBS that is just a full screen video of the webcam you want to use. Then you'll tell OBS to output that video on your second monitor, but the second monitor will actually be your computer's HDMI output plugged in to the ATEM Mini.</p>
<p>First, create a new scene, call it whatever you want, I'll call mine "Webcam". Inside that scene, add a new source of type "Video Capture Device". I'll call mine "Webcam Source".</p>

  

<p>When you create the source, it will ask you which video capture device you want to use, so choose your desired webcam at this step.</p>
<p>At this point you should see the webcam feed in the OBS main window. If it's not full screen, that's probably because the webcam is not full 1920x1080 resolution. You can drag the handles on the video to resize the picture to take up the full 1920x1080 screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, right click anywhere in the main video window and choose "Fullscreen Projector (Preview)". Or if you use OBS in "Studio Mode", right click on the right pane and choose "Fullscreen Projector (Program)". Choose your secondary monitor that's plugged in to the ATEM, and OBS should take over that monitor and show just the video feed.</p>
 Method 3: Hardware Encoder 
<p>If you don't want to tie up a computer with this task, or don't have the space for a computer, another option is to use a dedicated hardware encoder to convert the USB webcam to HDMI.</p>
<p>There aren't a lot of options on the market for this right now, likely because it's not a super common thing to need to do. Currently, any device that can convert a UVC webcam to HDMI is basically a tiny computer. One example is the YoloBox which can accept some USB webcams as a video source alongside HDMI cameras. You could use the YoloBox to convert the USB camera to HDMI using the HDMI output of the YoloBox.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another option is this <a href="https://geni.us/Z9hTXE">TBS2603au encoder/decoder</a>.&nbsp;</p>

  

<p>I originally was sent this device by TBS because I was interested in using it as an RTMP server. I wasn't able to figure that out, and have since switched to using the <a href="https://aaronpk.tv/timestamps/#magewell">Magewell Pro Convert</a> as an RTMP server which has been working great. But as I was poking around in the menus I realized that the TBS2603au has a USB port which can accept webcams!</p>
<p>So here are the step by step instructions for setting up the TBS2603au to output a USB webcam over its HDMI port.</p>
<p>The TBS2603au is controlled from its web interface. I'm going to assume you already know how to connect this to your network and configure the IP address and get to the device's web page. The default username and password are "admin" and "admin". Once you log in, you'll see a dashboard like this.</p>

<p></p>

<p>First, click on the "Encode" icon in the top bar. At the bottom, turn off the HDMI toggle and turn on the one next to USB.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next click on the "Extend" tab in the top menu and choose "Video Mix".</p>

<p></p>

<p>Scroll down to the "Output Config" section and change "Mix Enable" to "Off", and choose "USBCam" from the "Video Source" option.</p>

<p></p>

<p>At this point you should see your webcam's picture out the device's HDMI port!&nbsp;And if that's plugged in to the ATEM Mini, your webcam will appear in your multiview!</p>
<p></p>

<p>I've tried this with a few different webcams and they all work great!&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://geni.us/uHHcs0A">OBSBot Tiny</a> is an auto-tracking PTZ camera that follows your face. The nice thing is that the camera itself is doing the face tracking, so no drivers are required!</p>
<p>The <a href="https://geni.us/Ds8ko3">Elgato FaceCam</a> is a high quality webcam for your PC, and it also works with this device. Although at that point you should probably just get a DSLR/mirrorless camera to use with the ATEM Mini.</p>
<p>This even works with the <a href="https://geni.us/MAcd">Insta360 One X2</a> in webcam mode. You won't get a full 360 picture, since in webcam mode the Insta360 One X2 uses only one of its two cameras. It does do some auto-tracking though.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://geni.us/mevo-3-pack">Mevo Start</a> cameras are another interesting option, since you can crop in to specific parts of the video using a phone as a remote control.</p>
<p>There are a couple of problems with this method to be aware of. I wasn't able to find a way to output audio from the USB webcam, which means you will need to get your audio into the ATEM from another camera or external microphone. Another problem was with certain cameras (mainly the OBSBot Tiny), I left the device running overnight and in the morning it had crashed. I suspect it's because the OBSBot requires more power than other cameras due to its PTZ motor.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://geni.us/Z9hTXE">TBS encoder</a> isn't cheap, so it's not something you'd buy to use a generic webcam with your ATEM. But for use with specialized USB webcams like document cameras or PTZ cameras it could be a good option to use those cameras with streaming encoders like the ATEM Mini!</p>
<p>Let me know what USB webcams you'd like to use with your ATEM Mini or other hardware streaming encoder!</p>

<p>This article compares the security architecture of an application implemented using a public UI SPA with a trusted API backend and the same solution implemented using the backend for frontend (BFF) security architecture. The main difference is that the first solution is separated into two applications, implemented and deployed as two where as the second application is a single deployment and secured as a single application. The BFF has less risks and is a better security architecture but as always, no solution is perfect.</p>



<p>Setup BFF </p>



<p>The BFF solution is implemented and deployed as a single trusted application. All security is implemented in the trusted backend. The UI part of the application can only use the same domain APIs and cannot use APIs from separate domains. This architecture is the same as a standard ASP.NET Core Razor page UI confidential client. All APIs can be implemented in the same server part of the application. There is no requirement for downstream APIs. Due to this architecture, no sensitive data needs to be saved in the browser. This is effectively a trusted server rendered application. As with any server rendered application, this is protected using cookies with the required cookie protections and normally authenticates against an OIDC server using a trusted, confidential client with code flow and PKCE protection.  Because the application is trusted, further protections can be added as required for example MTLS, further OIDC FAPI requirements and so on. If downstream APIs are required, these APIs do not need to be exposed in the public zone (internet) and can be implemented using a trusted client and with token binding between the client and the server. The XSS protection can be improved using a better CSP and all front-channel cross-domain calls can be completely blocked. Dynamic data (ie nonces) can be used to produce the CSP. The UI can be hosted using a server rendered page and dynamic meta data and settings can easily be added for the UI without further architecture or DevOps flows. I always host the UI part in a BFF using a server rendered file. A big win with the BFF architecture, is that the access tokens and the refresh tokens are not stored publicly in the browser. When using SignalR, the secure same site HTTP only cookie can be used and no token for authorization is required in the URL. This is an improvement as long as CSRF protection is applied. Extra CSRF protection is required for all server requests because cookies are used (as well as same site). This can be implemented using anti-forgery tokens or forcing CORS preflight using a custom header. This must be enforced on the backend for all HTTP requests where required. Because only a single application needs to be deployed, DevOPs is simpler and reduces complexity, this is my experience after using this in production with Blazor. Reduced complexity is reduced costs.</p>







<p></p>



<p>Setup SPA with public API</p>



<p>An SPA page solution is deployed as a separate UI application and a separate public API application. Two security flows are used in this setup and are two completely separate applications, even though the API and UI are “business” tightly coupled. The best and most productive solutions with this setup are where the backend APIs are made specifically and optimized for the UI. The API must be public if the SPA is public. The SPA has no backend which can be used for security, tokens and sensitive data are stored in the browser and needs to be accessed using Javascript. As XSS is very hard to protect against, this will always have security risks. When using SPAs, as the access tokens are shared around the browser or added to URLs for web sockets, it is really important to revoke the tokens on a logout. The refresh token requires specific protections for usage in SPAs. Access tokens cannot be revoked and reference tokens with introspection used in the API is the preferred security solution. A logout is possible with introspection and reference tokens using the revocation endpoint. It is very hard to implement a SSO logout when using an SPA. This is because only the front-channel logout is possible in an SPA and not a back-channel logout as with a server rendered application. This setup has performance advantages compared to the BFF architecture when using downstream APIs. The APIs from different domains can be used directly. Implementing UIs with PWA requirements is easier to implement compared to the BFF architecture. CSRF attacks are easier to secure against using tokens but has more risk with an XSS attack due to sensitive data in the public client.</p>







<p></p>



<p>Advantages using BFF</p>



  Single trusted application instead of two apps, public untrusted UI + public trusted API (reduced attack surface)  Trusted client protected with a secret or certificate  No access/reference tokens in the browser  No refresh token in the browser  Web sockets security improved (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/signalr/overview/getting-started/introduction-to-signalr">SignalR</a>), no access/reference token in the URL  Backchannel logout, SSO logout possible  Improved <a href="https://csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com/">CSP</a> and security headers (can use dynamic data and block all other domains) =&gt; possible for better protection against XSS (depends on UI tech stack)  Can use <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-mutual-tls/">MTLS</a>, <a href="https://fapi.openid.net/">OIDC FAPI</a>, client binding for all downstream API calls from trusted UI app, so much improved security possible for the downstream API calls.  No architecture requirement for public APIs outside same domain, downstream APIs can be deployed in a private trusted zone.  Easier to build, deploy (my experience so far), Easier for me means reduced costs.  Reduced maintenance due to reduced complexity. (This is my experience so far)  



<p>Disadvantages using BFF</p>



  Downstream APIs require redirect or second API call (<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/reverse-proxy/index.html">YARP</a>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-on-behalf-of-flow">OBO</a>, •OAuth2 Resource Owner Credentials Flow, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/certauth">certificate auth</a> )  PWA support not out of the box  Performance worse if downstream APIs required (i.e an API call not on the same domain)  All UI API POST, DELETE, PATCH, PUT HTTP requests must use anti-forgery token or force CORS preflight as well as same site protection.  Cookies are hard to invalidate, requires extra logic (Is this required for a secure HTTP only same site cookie? low risk)  



<p>Discussions</p>



<p>I have had some excellent discussions on this topic and very valid points and arguments against some of points above. I would recommend reading these (link below) to get a bigger picture. Thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/kevin_chalet">kevin_chalet</a> for the great feedback and comments.</p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/openiddict/openiddict-samples/issues/180">https://github.com/openiddict/openiddict-samples/issues/180</a></p>



<p>Notes</p>



<p>A lot of opinions exist with this setup and I am sure lots of people see this in a different way with very valid points. Others are following software tech religions which prevents them accessing, evaluating different solution architectures. Nothing is ever black or white. No one solution is best for everything and all solutions have problems, or future problems with any setup will always happen. I believe using the BFF architecture, I can increase the security for the solutions with less effort and reduce the security risks and costs, thus creating more value for my clients. I still use SPA with APIs and see this as a valuable and good security solution for some systems. The entry level for BFF architecture with some tech stacks is still very high.</p>

<p>I enjoyed participating in the Mobile Ecosystem Forum (MEF) Enterprise webinar on December 9, 2021.</p>
<p>MEF explores its recent Personal Data and Identity Management Enterprise Survey – supported by Boku – in a webinar on 9th&nbsp;December 2021. MEF Programme Director, Andrew Parkin-White, is joined by Michael Becker, CEO of Identity Praxis and MEF Advisor and Phil Todd, Director of Stereoscope, who co-authored the report.</p>
<p>Andrew Parkin-White wrote a nice <a href="https://mobileecosystemforum.com/2022/01/07/identity-management-is-key-to-increasing-security-reducing-fraud-and-developing-a-seamless-customer-experience/">blog piece that summarised our discussion</a>. Three learnings came from our dialog:</p>
 
 Identity management is an iterative process with three core elements – initial identification, authentication (re-identifying the individual) and verification (ensuring the individual is who they claim to be) 
 Enterprises employ a vast array of technologies to execute these processes which are growing in scope and complexity 
 Understanding why identity management is necessary to enterprises and how this creates opportunities for vendors

<p>The New York Times Editorial Board in an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/01/opinion/january-6-attack-committee.html" title="Every Day Is Jan. 6 Now">unusually direct piece</a> last week:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is regular citizens [who threaten election officials] and <a href="https://www.vox.com/22774745/death-threats-election-workers-public-health-school">other public
servants</a>, who ask, <a href="https://twitter.com/BillKristol/status/1458768784836149250">“When can we use the guns?”</a> and who <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/01/peter-meijer-freshman-republican-impeach/620844/">vow to murder</a>
politicians who dare to vote their conscience. It is Republican lawmakers
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/04/us/politics/gop-voting-rights-democrats.html">scrambling to make it harder</a> for people to vote and easier to subvert their
will if they do. It is Donald Trump who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/17/us/politics/trump-voter-fraud-republicans.html">continues to stoke the flames</a> of
conflict with his rampant lies and limitless resentments and whose twisted
version of reality still dominates one of the nation’s two major political
parties.</p>
<p>In short, the Republic faces an existential threat from a movement that is
openly contemptuous of democracy and has shown that it is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/12/us/politics/republican-violent-rhetoric.html">willing to use
violence</a> to achieve its ends. No self-governing society can survive such a
threat by denying that it exists. Rather, survival depends on looking back and
forward at the same time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See also <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/22814025/democracy-trump-january-6-capitol-riot-election-violence" title="How does this end?">this Vox piece</a>. Great to see these outlets sound the alarm about
the dangers to American democracy. The threats are very real, and clear-eyed
discussions should ver much be dominating the public sphere.</p>
<p>More of this, please.</p>

<p>A year after we moved to northern California I acquired a pair of shiny new titanium hip joints. There would be <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2015/04/12/my-last-run/">no more running</a> for me. But I’m a lucky guy who gets to to bike and hike more than ever amidst spectacular scenery that no-one could fully explore in a lifetime.</p>
<p>Although the osteoarthritis was more advanced on the right side, we opted for bilateral replacement because the left side wasn’t far behind. Things hadn’t felt symmetrical in the years leading up to the surgery, and that didn’t change. There’s always a sense that something’s different about the right side. </p>
<p>We’re pretty sure it’s not the hardware. X-rays show that the implants remain firmly seated, and there’s no measurable asymmetry. Something about the software has changed, but there’s been no way to pin down what’s different about the muscles, tendons, and ligaments on that side, whether there’s a correction to be made, and if so, how.</p>
<p>Last month, poking around on my iPhone, I noticed that I’d never opened the Health app. That’s beause I’ve always been ambivalent about the quantified self movement. In college, when I left competive gymnastics and took up running, I avoided tracking time and distance. Even then, before the advent of fancy tech, I knew I was capable of obsessive data-gathering and analysis, and didn’t want to go there. It was enough to just run, enjoy the scenery, and feel the afterglow.</p>
<p>When I launched the Health app, I was surprised to see that it had been counting my steps since I became an iPhone user 18 months ago. Really? I don’t recall opting into that feature. </p>
<p>Still, it was (of course!) fascinating to see the data and trends. And one metric in particular grabbed my attention: Walking Asymmetry. </p>
<blockquote><p>
Walking asymmetry is the percent of time that your steps with one foot are faster or slower than the other foot.<br>
…<br>
An even or symmetrical walk is often an important physical therapy goal when recovering from injury.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Here’s my chart for the past year.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I first saw this in mid-December when the trend was at its peak. What caused it? Well, it’s been rainy here (thankfully!), so I’ve been riding less, maybe that was a factor? </p>
<p>Since then I haven’t biked more, though, and I’ve walked the usual mile or two most days, with longer hikes on weekends. Yet the data suggest that I’ve reversed the trend.</p>
<p>What’s going on here?</p>
<p>Maybe this form of biofeedback worked. Once aware of the asymmetry I subconsciously corrected it. But that doesn’t explain the November/December trend.</p>
<p>Maybe the metric is bogus. A phone in your pocket doesn’t seem like a great way to measure walking asymmetry. I’ve also noticed that my step count and distances vary, on days when I’m riding, in ways that are hard to explain.</p>
<p>I’d like to try some real gait analysis using wearable tech. I suspect that data recorded from a couple of bike rides, mountain hikes, and neighborhood walks could help me understand the forces at play, and that realtime feedback could help me balance those forces. </p>
<p>I wouldn’t want to wear it all the time, though. It’d be a diagnostic and therapeutic tool, not a lifestyle. </p>

<p>In September 1982, artificial intelligence professor Scott Fahlman made a post on the Carnegie Mellon Computer Science Department “general” bboard inventing the original smiley :-).  I remember thinking at the time when I read it “what a good idea!”.  But in 2002 when I told friends about it, I couldn’t find Scott’s post online anywhere.</p>
<p>So in 2002, I led a computing archaeology expedition to restore his post.  As described in <a href="https://self-issued.info/Smiley/Smiley.html">my original post describing this accomplishment</a>, after a significant effort to locate it, on September 10, 2002 the original post made by Scott Fahlman on CMU CS general bboard was retrieved by Jeff Baird from an October 1982 backup tape of the spice vax (cmu-750x).  Here is Scott’s original post:</p>
<blockquote>
 19-Sep-82 11:44    Scott E  Fahlman             :-)
From: Scott E  Fahlman &lt;Fahlman at Cmu-20c&gt;

I propose that the following character sequence for joke markers:

:-)

Read it sideways.  Actually, it is probably more economical to mark
things that are NOT jokes, given current trends.  For this, use

</blockquote>
<p>I’m reposting this here now both to recommemorate the accomplishment nearly twenty years later, and because my page at Microsoft Research where it was originally posted is no longer available.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/books/project-hail-mary/9780593135204" title="“Project Hail Mary” on Bookshop.org">Project Hail Mary</a> follows the success of Andy Weir’s first novel, <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/the-martian/9780553418026" title="“The Martian” on Bookshop.org">The
Martian</a>, and delivers the same kind of enjoyment. If a harrowing story of a
solitary man in extreme environments using science and his wits to overcome one
obstacle after another then this is the book for you. No super powers, no
villains, no other people, really — just the a competent scientist overcoming
the odds through experimentation, constant iteration, and sheer creativity.
Personally I can’t get enough of it. Shoot it right into my veins.</p>
<p>Andy Weir seems to know his strengths and weaknesses, given these two books. If
you want read stories of a diverse array of people interacting and growing
through compelling character arcs, well, look elsewhere. <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/project-hail-mary/9780593135204" title="“Project Hail Mary” on Bookshop.org">Project Hail Mary</a>
doesn’t feature characters, really, but archetypes. No one really grows in this
story: Ryland Grace, our protagonist and narrator, displays a consistent
personality from start to finish. The book attempts to show him overcoming a
character flaw, but it comes so late and at such variance to how he behaves and
speaks to us that it frankly makes no sense.</p>
<p>But never mind, I can read other books for character growth and interaction. I’m
here for the compelling plot, super interesting ideas and challenges (a whole
new species that lives on the sun and migrates to Venus to breed? Lay it on
me). It tickles my engineering and scientist inclinations, and we could use
more of that sort of plotting in media.</p>
<p>So hoover it up. <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/project-hail-mary/9780593135204" title="“Project Hail Mary” on Bookshop.org">Project Hail Mary</a> is a super fun adventure with compelling
ideas, creative, competent people overcoming extreme circumstances without magic
or hand-waving, and an unexpected friendship between two like-minded nerds in
space.</p>
<p>I bet it’ll make a <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12042730/" title="IMDB: “Project Hail Mary”">good movie</a>, too.</p>

<p>Like Thiebaud, I love the high angle on the easily overlooked, and opportunity for revelations not obtainable from the ground, or in the midst.</p>
<p>Example. Can you guess where these mountains are?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Try Los Angeles. I shot that, as I did the others in <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/albums/72157600573088191/with/673122518/">this album</a>, during the approach to LAX on a flight from Houston.</p>
<p>Here’s another shot in that series:</p>
<p></p>
<p>That’s 10,068-foot <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_San_Antonio">Mt. San Antonio</a>, aka Old Baldy, highest of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Gabriel_Mountains">San Gabriel Mountains</a>. These are <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2013/10/28/loving-the-alps-of-los-angeles/">Los Angeles’ own Alps</a>, which wall the north side of the L.A. basin, thwarting sprawl in that direction. The view is up San Antonio Canyon, below which lays a suburb-free delta of rocks and gravel spreading outward from canyon’s mouth. Across that mouth, and in a series of of similar ones below is a dam. These are for slowing “debris flows” coming out of the mountains after heavy rains, and sorting the flows’ contents into boulders, rocks, and gravel. Businesses that trade in these geological goods are also sited there. Imagine a business selling fresh lava from the base of a volcano, and you have some idea of how rapidly the geology changes here.</p>
<p>Anyway, while there is Thiebaud-informed art to that shot, there is also a purpose: I want people to see how these mountains are alive and dangerous in ways unlike no others flanking a city.</p>
<p>My main influence toward that purpose is&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McPhee">John McPhee</a>, the best nonfiction writer ever to walk the Earth—and report on it. Dig <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1988/09/26/los-angeles-against-the-mountains-i">Los Angeles Against the Mountains</a>. Doesn’t get better than that.</p>
<p>McPhee is 90 now. I dread losing him.</p>

  Is it possible to fix the tragedy of the commons problem with a DAO Governance Token?

<p>One of the biggest problems in open source software development today is that it’s that the majority of open source software is written by developers as side projects on their nights and weekends. Out of the mix of developers who do produce software in their nights and weekends only a small sliver of them receive any funding for their work. Of the small portion of developers who do get sponsored, an even smaller percentage are actually able to make enough money to fully cover their expenses in life. So clearly we haven’t developed a sustainable solution to finance open source software development. So what are the main ways that open source software development gets funded? The two primary methods that I see open source software being developed with is via organizational sponsors or altruistic funding. Let’s break these down a bit more to gain a better understanding of them.</p>

<p>The most common and well understood method today that open source projects are funded is via for-profit corporations sponsoring development of projects by way of allowing their full time staff to work on these large projects. Some great examples of this are projects like Kubernetes, Linux kernel, React Framework, Hashicorp Vault, and Rust programming language. In all of these examples, these projects are either directly managed via a team of developers at large organizations (think React Framework being maintained by Facebook), managed by a startup who opensources their core product with additional sticky features (think Hashicorp Vault), managed by a foundation with a combination of many different developers from many different organizations (think Kubernetes and the Linux kernel these days and now Rust Lang), and finally there’s hybrid projects which have transitioned from one category to another over time (Think Rust language being started at Mozilla and then transferred to a foundation). With all of these models one thing is clear. Developers have a day job that pays them and they’re essentially employed to produce open source software. The reasons why many companys are funding developers to produce open source development is so scattered that I’m sure I couldn’t name them all. However, one thing in my experience is clear and that is that most companies have some form of strategic decision at play that leads them down the path of making their source code open. Whether that strategy be as simple as they want to allow others to solve a problem they’ve had to solve, they want to leverage open source as a sales channel, or they’re simply looking for free software developement contributions from developers who like the project. Whatever, the reason the company has to justify it’s contributions it’s pretty clear that this is a major avenue for contribution to the OSS community.</p>

<p>The second most common method of development which has been around for awhile, but has only recently become a more legitimate model of funding has been through altruistic funding. What I mean by this method is that people, organizations, or other such entities will “sponsor” a developer who’s released an open source project that they believe should continue to be worked on. This most commonly was done via Paypal or Buy me a coffee in the past with Patreon and Github Sponsors getting involved more recently as well. This model of funding is becoming more common of a way to fund a small project which is used substantially by much larger projects or companies who want some certainty that the project will continue to be maintained in the future. It’s shown some promise for becoming a sustainable source of funding for developers who are looking for a way to monetize their projects without a massive overhead that comes with starting a company. However, while this method does leave the original maintainer in control of their project to continue to bring their vision to reality, it often times does not provide a sustainable and large enough income for most maintainers to leverage this avenue full time.</p>

<p>So what’s up with this DAO governance token idea then?</p>

<p>To put it simply the concept of leveraging a DAO token to manage an open source project is still just that - an idea. So why do I considered it worth exploring? Today, in the Defi space we see many different projects that are being built completely open source and doing so with often times very complex tokenomics schemes just to sustainably fund the development of the protocol. With each new project the developers need to find a new way to integrate a token into the system in order to fund their time and effort that they’d like to put into growing the project. However, what if we could re-shape the purpose of tokens to make it actually what the tokens are about which is funding the development of the project rather than trying to create a new gift card scheme for each new project?</p>

<p>The way I imagine this would work is via a DAO goverance token which effectively represents a share of the project. Each token that’s already been minted would allow for voting on proposals for to accept or reject new changes to the project in the same way that DAOs allow for decentralized goverance of treasuries today. However these proposals all come in the form of a pull request to modify the code allowing for developers to directly receive value for the proposed changes their making. Where things get interesting is that along with the new pull request comes a proposal set forth by the contributor who would assign a value they believe it’s worth represented in the value of new tokens which would be approved if the pull request is approved. This effectively would be diluting the value of the current tokens in exchange for work they’ve done to improve the project leading to an interesting trade in value. Current majority stake holders give up a small portion of their funds in exchange for receiving new contributions if and only if they believe the dilution is acceptable.</p>

<p>So how does this make developers money?</p>

<p>As a project grows and is utilized by more and more developers it will create an economic incentive for people and companies who wish to steer a project to buy up the currently available tokens or contribute to the project in order to collect these tokens. This value would be tradeable in terms of real world value either for money to buy food or for additional utility in upstream or downstream projects. The value of the tokens is only as valuable as the number of people who are utilizing the project and believe they need the ability to affect the direction of the project or make sure it remains maintained. Meaning for projects like Kubernetes where there’s numerous companies who’s core infrastructure built on top of this project they want to make sure they’re features are getting added and supported. Just like they do today in the Cloud Native Computing Foundation which sees many people from many different organizations and backgrounds contributing to the project now.</p>

<p>Where this becomes interesting is in the economic decision making that happens as a market is formed around maintainership of projects. With many of the good things that will be introduced like being able to have more full-time freelance software developers available I’m sure there will be interesting economic issues that will be introduced. It’s my belief though that this controversy will be worked out in different ways through different principles that projects will choose. As an example today one of the most obvious problems in large projects today such as when SushiSwap forked Uniswap and started taking sushiswap in a different direction. However, the legitimacy of the fork will help to form interesting economic behaviors on whether or not the value of the fork will go up like SushiSwap has shown by adding new and interesting contributions to their fork, or whether it will go down like many of the random clone projects that often lead to scams do.</p>

<p>I believe that if the mechanics of the maintainership role are established correctly then it may even be possible to create some interesting dynamics to reduce forking by leveraging the market dynamics. As an example if the DAO fork was required to mint the same number of tokens in the new project as the original project and make them assigned to the same maintainers then the original maintainers of the project could leverage their newly minted tokens in the new project in order to outright reject all proposals in the fork and slow down the momentum of the project. I tend to think this may be bad for innovation, but it’s an interesting example of how leveraging markets to make maintainership decisions can be utilized to build sustainability in open source development given that maintainership status of projects has legitimate value that if broken up and governed properly could be leveraged to reshape how software development is funded.</p>

<p>I had a fabulous time talking with my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/vibronet/">Vittorio Bertocci</a> while recording the podcast <a href="https://identityunlocked.auth0.com/public/49/Identity%2C-Unlocked.--bed7fada/8876c26c">Identity, Unlocked: OpenID Connect with Mike Jones</a>.  We covered a lot of ground in 43:29 – protocol design ground, developer ground, legal ground, and just pure history.</p>
<p>As always, people were a big part of the story.  Two of my favorite parts are talking about how <a href="https://twitter.com/Kim_Cameron">Kim Cameron</a> brought me into the digital identity world to build the Internet’s missing identity layer (2:00-2:37) and describing how we applied the “<a href="https://twitter.com/nov">Nov Matake</a> Test” when thinking about keeping <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a> simple (35:16-35:50).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/14745765789"></a>Since <a href="https://www.legacy.com/ca/obituaries/theglobeandmail/name/kim-cameron-obituary?pid=200830800&amp;__cf_chl_captcha_tk__=vxIVvG6O.QvgP3hV8.iTPhw89IS27Qv8JsoIlvuoo1s-1639851363-0-gaNycGzNCr0">Kim’s passing</a>, I’ve been reflecting on his impact on my life and remembering some of the things that made him special.  Here’s a few stories I’d like to tell in his honor.</p>
<p>Kim was more important to my career and life than most people know.  Conversations with him in early 2005 led me to leave Microsoft Research and join his quest to “Build the Internet’s missing identity layer” – a passion that still motivates me to this day.</p>
<p>Within days of me joining the identity quest, Kim asked me to go with him to the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/sets/72157720211859061">first gathering of the Identity Gang</a> at PC Forum in Scottsdale, Arizona.  Many of the people that I met there remain important in my professional and personal life!  The <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/iiw2005/">first Internet Identity Workshop</a> soon followed.</p>
<p>Kim taught me a lot about building positive working relationships with others.  Early on, he told me to always try to find something nice to say to others.  Showing his devious sense of humor, he said “Even if you are sure that their efforts are doomed to fail because of fatal assumptions on their part, you can at least say to them ‘You’re working on solving a really important problem!’ :-)”  He modelled by example that consensus is much easier to achieve when you make allies rather than enemies.  And besides, it’s a lot more fun for everyone that way!</p>
<p>Kim was always generous with his time and hospitality and lots of fun to be around.  I remember he and Adele inviting visitors from Deutsche Telekom to their home overlooking the water in Bellevue.  He organized a night at the opera for identity friends in Munich.  He took my wife Becky and I and Tony Nadalin out to dinner at his favorite restaurant in Paris, La Coupole.  He and Adele were the instigators behind many a fun evening.  He had a love of life beyond compare!</p>
<p>At one point in my career, I was hoping to switch to a manager more supportive of my passion for standards work, and asked Kim if I could work for him.  I’ll always remember his response: “Having you work for me would be great, because I wouldn’t have to manage you.  But the problem is that then they’d make me have others work for me too.  Managing people would be the death of me!”</p>
<p>This blog exists because Kim encouraged me to blog.</p>
<p>I once asked Kim why there were so many Canadians working in digital identity.  He replied: “Every day as a Canadian, you think ‘What is it that makes me uniquely Canadian, as opposed to being American?  Whereas Americans never give it a thought.  Canadians are always thinking about identity.'”</p>
<p>Kim was a visionary and a person of uncommon common sense.  His Information Card paradigm was ahead of its time.  For instance, the “selecting cards within a wallet” metaphor that Windows CardSpace introduced is now widespread – appearing in platform and Web account selectors, as well as emerging “self-sovereign identity” wallets, containing digital identities that you control.  The demos people are giving now sure look a lot like InfoCard demos from back in the day!</p>
<p>Kim was a big believer in privacy and giving people control over their own data (see the <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/stories/2005/05/13/TheLawsOfIdentity.pdf">Laws of Identity</a>).  He championed the effort for Microsoft to acquire and use the U-Prove selective disclosure technology, and to make it freely available for others to use.</p>
<p>Kim was hands-on.  To get practical experience with OpenID Connect, he wrote a complete OpenID Provider in 2018 and even got it certified!  You can see the certification entry at <a href="https://openid.net/certification/">https://openid.net/certification/</a> for the “IEF Experimental Claimer V0.9” that he wrote.</p>
<p>Kim was highly valued by Microsoft’s leaders (and many others!).  He briefly retired from Microsoft most of a decade ago, only to have the then-Executive Vice President of the Server and Tools division, Satya Nadella, immediately seek him out and ask him what it would take to convince him to return.  Kim made his asks, the company agreed to them, and he was back within about a week.  One of his asks resulted in the AAD business-to-customer (B2C) identity service in production use today.  He also used to have regular one-on-ones with Bill Gates.</p>
<p>Kim wasn’t my mentor in any official capacity, but he was indeed my mentor in fact. I believe he saw potential in me and chose to take me under his wing and help me develop in oh so many ways. I’ll always be grateful for that, and most of all, for his friendship.</p>
<p>In September 2021 at the European Identity and Cloud (EIC) conference in Munich, <a href="https://twitter.com/JacksonShaw">Jackson Shaw</a> and I remarked to each other that neither of us had heard from Kim in a while.  I reached out to him, and he responded that his health was failing, without elaborating.  Kim and I talked for a while on the phone after that.  He encouraged me that the work we are doing now is really important, and to press forward quickly.</p>
<p>On October 25, 2021, <a href="https://twitter.com/vibronet">Vittorio Bertocci</a> organized an informal CardSpace team reunion in Redmond.  Kim wished he could come but his health wasn’t up to travelling.  Determined to include him in a meaningful way, I called him on my phone during the reunion and Kim spent about a half hour talking to most of the ~20 attendees in turn.  They shared stories and laughed!  As Vittorio said to me when we learned of his passing, we didn’t know then that we were saying goodbye.</p>
 
<p>P.S.  Here’s a few of my favorite photos from the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/sets/72157720211859061">first event that Kim included me in</a>:</p>

<p>In 2018, all European member states, together with Norway and Lichtenstein, signed a declaration stating the joint ambition to take advantage of blockchain technology. These 29 countries founded the European Blockchain Partnership (EBP), and within this partnership, they decided to build the so-called European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI).</p><p>EBSI was created aiming to, on the one hand, provide blockchain capabilities used by the partner of the EPB to implement and realize blockchain projects and use cases within these countries. Moreover, on the other hand, to achieve certain use cases on a European level. The so-called use case groups were defined and present the working groups related to a specific use case to support the latter idea. These use case groups consist of representatives of the EBP member counties, domain experts as well as the European Commission.</p><p>Initially, four use case groups were founded, namely the European Self-Sovereign Identity Framework (ESSIF), the diploma use case, document traceability, and secure document transfer. ESSIF focuses on digital identities where the user is in control over her identity data. The diploma use case focuses on educational diplomas of students and related processes such as issuing, verifying, revocation, and all of these processes in cross-border scenarios. Document traceability considers the anchoring of document-related identifiers like hashes on the blockcahin and secure document sharing on tax-related information transfer.</p><p>EBSI defined so-called use case groups that should be achieved using the provided capabilities to showcase their functionality and bring in expertise in the specific fields. Each use case group consists of representatives of the member states, domain experts, and the European Commission.</p> About EBSI4Austria <p>EBSI4Austria is a CEF funded project with two main objectives. First, EBSI4Austria aims to set up, operate and maintain the Austrian’s EBSI node. Second, we pilot the diploma use case on the Austrian level supported by two Universities and data providers as well as verifiers.</p><p>EBSI created a so-called early adopter program to speed up the use case integration of the participating countries. EBSI4Austria joined this ambiguous program already in the first wave reflecting our project’s motivation.</p> Partners <p>EBSI4Austria consists of three partners, namely two Universities such as <a href="https://www.tugraz.at/">Graz University of Technology (TU Graz)</a> and the <a href="https://www.wu.ac.at/">Vienna University of Economics (WU Vienna)</a>, together with <a href="https://danubetech.com/">Danube Tech</a>, a Vienna based company that provides leading expertise in Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) as well as distributed systems and is involved in related standardization bodies. The Universities are responsible for issuing students’ diplomas and also verifying them. Austrian’s EBSI node is set up and operated at the department eGovernment innovation center (EGIZ), which is part of Graz University of technology.</p> User Story <p>Figure 1 illustrates the user story that is covered in our project. A student studying at the Graz University of Technology is finishing her bachelor’s program. TU Graz issues her diploma credential stating her bachelor’s degree, which the student stores in her wallet. Next, she wants to apply for a master’s program at the Vienna University of Economics and Business; thus, she presents her bachelor’s diploma credential. After successfully finishing her master’s program at WU Vienna, the university issues her master’s diploma credential to the student. The student is very ambitious; therefore, she applies for a Ph.D. position at the Berlin Institute of Technology by presenting her diplomas. All involved parties utilize the EBSI blockchain network to verify if the issuing universities are trusted&nbsp;issuers.</p>Figure 1: User Story of the Diploma Use&nbsp;Case Technology <p>In order to implement our EBSI4Austria project, we used similar technologies as many other Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) initiatives, i.e., based on building blocks such as Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs).</p><p>We created two DIDs on the EBSI blockchain for the two universities, as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Test DID for TU Graz: <a href="https://dev.uniresolver.io/#did:ebsi:zuoS6VfnmNLduF2dynhsjBU">did:ebsi:zuoS6VfnmNLduF2dynhsjBU</a>  Test DID for WU Vienna: <a href="https://dev.uniresolver.io/#did:ebsi:z23EQVGi5so9sBwytv6nMXMo">did:ebsi:z23EQVGi5so9sBwytv6nMXMo</a>  <p>In addition, we registered them in EBSI’s Trusted Issuer Registry&nbsp;(TIR).</p><p>We also designed Verifiable Credentials to model digital versions of university diplomas. We implemented them using different credential and proof formats to accommodate changing requirements and guidelines in the EBSI specifications throughout the year. See here for some examples in different formats:</p><p>Example Diploma by TU&nbsp;Graz:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/danubetech/ebsi4austria-examples/blob/main/verifiablecredentials/diploma-tu-graz.jsonld">JSON-LD+LD-Proofs</a>  <a href="https://github.com/danubetech/ebsi4austria-examples/blob/main/verifiablecredentials/diploma-tu-graz.jsonldjwt">JSON-LD+JWT</a> (also see <a href="https://github.com/danubetech/ebsi4austria-examples/blob/main/verifiablecredentials/diploma-tu-graz.jsonldjwt.payload">JWT payload&nbsp;only</a>)  <a href="https://github.com/danubetech/ebsi4austria-examples/blob/main/verifiablecredentials/diploma-tu-graz.jwt">JSON+JWT</a> (also see <a href="https://github.com/danubetech/ebsi4austria-examples/blob/main/verifiablecredentials/diploma-tu-graz.jwt.payload">JWT payload&nbsp;only</a>)  <p>Example Diploma by WU&nbsp;Wien:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/danubetech/ebsi4austria-examples/blob/main/verifiablecredentials/master_beispiel_de.png">Paper version</a> (in&nbsp;German)  <a href="https://github.com/danubetech/ebsi4austria-examples/blob/main/verifiablecredentials/master_beispiel_en.png">Paper version</a> (in&nbsp;English)  <a href="https://github.com/danubetech/ebsi4austria-examples/blob/main/verifiablecredentials/diploma-wu-wien.jsonld">JSON-LD+LD-Proofs</a>  <a href="https://github.com/danubetech/ebsi4austria-examples/blob/main/verifiablecredentials/diploma-wu-wien.jsonldjwt">JSON-LD+JWT</a> (also see <a href="https://github.com/danubetech/ebsi4austria-examples/blob/main/verifiablecredentials/diploma-wu-wien.jsonldjwt.payload">JWT payload&nbsp;only</a>)  <a href="https://github.com/danubetech/ebsi4austria-examples/blob/main/verifiablecredentials/diploma-wu-wien.jwt">JSON+JWT</a> (also see <a href="https://github.com/danubetech/ebsi4austria-examples/blob/main/verifiablecredentials/diploma-wu-wien.jwt.payload">JWT payload&nbsp;only</a>)  <p>We also designed our own (experimental) JSON-LD context in order to be able to work with Linked Data Proofs (see <a href="https://github.com/danubetech/ebsi4austria-examples/blob/main/context/essif-schemas-vc-2020-v1.jsonld">essif-schemas-vc-2020-v1.jsonld</a>). In our opinion, it would be preferable if JSON-LD contexts were provided by EBSI to all member states instead of having to do this separately for each EBSI pilot&nbsp;project.</p><p>We use the following technologies in our&nbsp;project:</p>  <a href="https://uniresolver.io/">Universal Resolver</a> → For resolving DIDs.  <a href="https://uniregistrar.io/">Universal Registrar</a> → For creating&nbsp;DIDs.  <a href="https://uniissuer.io/">Universal Issuer</a> → For issuing&nbsp;VCs.  <a href="https://univerifier.io/">Universal Verifier</a> → For verifying VCs.  <a href="https://gitlab.grnet.gr/essif-lab/infrastructure_2/danubetech/SSI_Java_Libraries_project_summary">SSI Java Libraries</a>  <a href="https://github.com/weboftrustinfo/ld-signatures-java">ld-signatures-java</a> — For Linked Data Signatures.  <a href="https://github.com/danubetech/verifiable-credentials-java">verifiable-credentials-java</a> — For Verifiable Credentials.  <p>We set up the following demonstration websites:</p>  <a href="https://tugraz.ebsi4austria.danubetech.com/">https://tugraz.ebsi4austria.danubetech.com/</a> — Issuer demo&nbsp;website  <a href="https://wuwien.ebsi4austria.danubetech.com/">https://wuwien.ebsi4austria.danubetech.com/</a> — Verifier demo&nbsp;website  <p>See <a href="https://github.com/danubetech/ebsi4austria-examples">this Github repository</a> for additional technical details about EBSI4Austria.</p> Multi-University Pilot <p>Within EBSI’s early adopter program, EBSI4Austria also joined the multi-university pilot (MU pilot) in which the focus is on issuing and verifying student diplomas between universities but in this case, even in a cross-border scenario. This multi-university pilot should underpin the possibilities even across countries.</p><p>While working on the MU pilot, we participated in several EBSI Early Adopter program meetings to identify issuers, verifiers, and types of credentials. We were in contact with members of Spanish EBSI pilot projects (especially from the SSI company Gataca), to compare our approaches to EBSI DIDs and Verifiable Credentials. We had several technical discussions and email exchanges regarding details of those credentials, e.g. about the JSON-LD contexts and exact proof formats we were planning to use. During these exchanges, we were able to exchange initial examples of verifiable credentials and verify&nbsp;them.</p><p>Within one of the “clusters” of the EBSI MU pilot, we also collaborated closely with the “UniCert” aka “EBSI4Germany” project led by the Technical University of Berlin, a member of the EBSI early adopter program and the German IDunion consortium. This collaboration proved to be particularly interesting for the following reasons:</p><p>1. Since TU Berlin participates both in EBSI and IDunion, they have unique insights into the similarities and differences between these different SSI networks.</p><p>2. TU Berlin was also able to share some experiences regarding the use of existing standards such as Europass and ELMO/EMREX, which can help with semantic interoperability of Verifiable Credentials use in&nbsp;EBSI.</p>Figure 2: Multi-university pilot scenario.<p>Note: This blog post was co-authored by Andreas Abraham (<a href="https://www.egiz.gv.at/">eGovernment Innovation Center</a>) and Markus Sabadello (<a href="https://danubetech.com/">Danube Tech</a>). The EBSI4Austria project was funded under agreement No INEA/CEF/ICT/A2020/2271545.</p>

   It is suggested that all which glitters is gold when it comes to data: the more data, the better. I have challenged this thinking that more data is better on numerous occasions, and essentially they all come to the same point. Data volume does not lead to better decisions.&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>A “simplistic” graph is doing the rounds (again) and is copied below. The two-axis links the quality of a decision and the person's capability with data.&nbsp; It infers that boards, executives and senior leadership need to be “data-savvy” if they are to make better decisions. Data Savvy is a position between being “data-naive or data-devoid” and “drunk on data.”&nbsp; The former has no data or skills; the latter is too much data or cannot use the tools. Data Savvy means you are skilled with the correct data and the right tools.</p><p>This thinking is driven by those trying to sell data training by simplifying a concept to such a point its becomes meaningless but is easy to sell/ buy and looks great as a visual.&nbsp; When you don’t have enough time to reflect on the graph and the message, it looks logical, inspired and correct - it is none of these things. &nbsp; The basis of the idea is that a board or senior leadership team who are data-savvy will make better decisions, based on the framing that if you are naive or drunk on data, you will make poor decisions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The first issue I have is that if the data does not have <a href="https://opengovernance.net/updating-board-paper-for-a-data-attestation-section-db59d736ccc5">attestation</a>, your capability (data-savviness) will make no difference to the quality of the decision. &nbsp;One could argue that you will test the data if data-savvy, but this is also untrue as most boards cannot test the data, relying on the organisations' processes and procedures to ensure “quality” data. This is a wild assumption.&nbsp;</p><br><p></p><p>It is worth searching for what “data-savvy” means and reading a few articles.&nbsp; You will find that many put becoming data-savvy as a step in the journey to being data-driven.&nbsp; To a second point:&nbsp; data-driven means you will always be late.&nbsp; To wait for enough data to reduce the risk to match your risk framework means that you will be late in the decision-making process.&nbsp; Data-driven does not make you fast, agile, ahead, innovative or adaptive. &nbsp; <a href="https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/2021/12/hard-fast-vs-late-slow.html">Data-driven makes you late, slow, behind and a follower.</a></p><p>Is the reality of wanting to be data-savvy or a desire to be data-driven that you look to use data to reduce risk and therefore become more risk-averse, which means you miss the <a href="https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/2021/06/the-shadowy-hierarchy.html">signals</a> that would make you genuinely innovative?</p><p>The question as a CDO (data or digital) we should reflect on is “how do we reconcile that we want to be first, innovative, creative or early; but our processes, methods, and tools depend on data that means we will always be late!” The more innovative we want to be, the less data we will have and the more risk we need to take, which does not align to the leadership, culture or rewards/ incentives that we have or operate to.</p>

<blockquote><p>“We know now that technology and business models are accelerating at a faster pace than ever before in human history. In 10 years time, who knows what kind of conversations we’re going to be having, but the one thing we know is that we’re all going to be increasingly vulnerable, as more of our services, more of our citizen identity, move online.” – Surash Patel, VP EMEA, TeleSign Corporation 2021 (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5WlrHSohpM&amp;t=1569s)">click here to listen</a>).1</p></blockquote>
 
 <p></p>
<p>I recently sat down with &nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/surashpatel/?originalSubdomain=uk">Surash Patel, VP EMEA</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.telesign.com/">TeleSign</a>&nbsp;and Board Member of the&nbsp;<a href="https://mobileecosystemforum.com/about/global-board/">Mobile Ecosystem Forum (MEF)</a>&nbsp;to discuss the personal data &amp; identity (PD&amp;I) market, for a PD&amp;I market assessment report I’m working on for the MEF (the report will be out in January 2022).&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5WlrHSohpM&amp;t=1569s">Surash’s above quote</a>&nbsp;stuck out to me because I think he is right. It also reminds me of another quote, one from WPP:</p>
<blockquote><p>“By 2030 society will no longer tolerate a business model that relies on mass transactions of increasingly sensitive personal data: a quite different system will be in place.” – WPP2</p></blockquote>
<p>I took away three key insights, although are more, from my interview with Surash:</p>
 
 Enterprises must immediately start learning how to master [mobile] identity verification; mobile identity verification can help reduce losses to fraud and self-inflicted losses of revenue. 
 Enterprises that effectively use mobile identity verification can create value and generate trust and engagement at every stage of the customer journey. 
 There is much we—people, private organizations, and public institutions—need to know and do to equip for the now and prepare for the future. 
 
<p>The following summarizes my conversation with Surash. . To watch the complete interview with Surash Patel of TeleSign (39:11 min),&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5WlrHSohpM">click here</a>.</p>
 Risk Mitigation, Value Creation, and the Customer Journey 
<p>When introducing himself and his background, Surash opened with a wonderfully self-reflective quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I completely missed a trick on my career and where it was going, in that I thought about the value exchange between the consumer and the brand. From a marketing perspective, I never really considered it from the digital identity perspective before–seeing the numbers on digital fraud right now I think that case is becoming more and more clear to me.” – Surash Patel, VP EMEA, Telesign Corporation 2021&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5WlrHSohpM&amp;t=50s">click here</a>).</p></blockquote>
<p>By reading between the lines of his statement, I gather that, as a marketer, he previously saw identity as a tool for audience targeting and promotion. But, once he went into the infrastructure side of the business, he realized identity plays an even bigger role throughout the industry. This is because identity has a critical role at every touchpoint along the customer journey–not just for marketing, but for fraud prevention, revenue protection, and trust.</p>
 Risk Mitigation and managing losses 
<p>Drawing from industry reports, Surash notes that&nbsp;t&nbsp;<a href="https://www.javelinstrategy.com/content/2021-identity-fraud-report-shifting-angles-identity-fraud">businesses are losing upwards of $56 billion a year to fraud each year</a>.4&nbsp;Because of this, “knowing your customer,” i.e., knowing that there is a legitimate human on the other side of a digital transaction, is not just a nice to have, but a business imperative. Surash points out that it’s not just fraud that brands must contend with when it comes to losses. They must also contend with self-inflicted wounds.</p>
<p>Surash referenced a report from&nbsp;<a href="http://file///Users/michaelbecker/Dropbox/MEF%20PD&amp;I%20Mkt%20Assessment%20Materials/Becker%20Articles/Under_Review/%5Bhttps://www.checkout.com/connected-payments/black-boxes-and-paradoxes%5D(https://www.checkout.com/connected-payments/black-boxes-and-paradoxes)">Checkout.com</a>&nbsp;which found that, in 2019, brands in the UK, US, France, and Germany lost $20.3 billion in 2019 due to false declines at check out, i.e.&nbsp;identity verification system failures. $12.7 billion of these losses went to competitors, while $7.6 billion just evaporated.5&nbsp;My takeaway from this is that it’s necessary for brands to see identity verification as a strategic imperative, not just an IT function.</p>
<p>But, reducing fraud and managing revenue breakage is not all Surash brought up. He also noted that, based on findings in the Checkout.com report, consumers would pay an average of $4 to be sure their transactions are secure. So, not only can brands reduce fraud, but they can also retain sales by more effectively identifying their customers (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5WlrHSohpM&amp;t=693s">listen to his comments here</a>).</p>
 The Potential For Harm is Real and Must Be Managed 
<p>Let’s briefly return to Surash’s quote above:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We know now that technology and, you know, business models are accelerating at a faster pace than ever before in human history. In 10 years time, who knows what kind of conversations we’re going to be having, but the one thing we know is that we’re all going to be increasingly vulnerable as more of our services, more of a citizen identity, move online.” – Surash Patel, VP EMEA, Telesign Corporation 2021 (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5WlrHSohpM&amp;t=1569s">click here to listen</a>).6</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree with him–the people, not just businesses, are at risk of being even more vulnerable than they are now, but that does not mean the risks we face today are trivial. Harm from the misuse of personal data is all around us. We primarily measure this in financial terms. For example, in 2020,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aarp.org/money/scams-fraud/info-2021/texts-smartphone.html">U.S. consumers reported losses of $86M to fraud originating from text messaging scams</a>&nbsp;.7</p>
 On harm 
<p>There is&nbsp;<a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/cybersecurity/459427-privacy-law-needs-privacy-harm">more privacy harm out there than financial loss</a>, noted by Ignacio N. Cofone,8 and it is not a trivial discussion to be slipped under the rug. In fact, it is one of the fundamental drivers behind emerging people-centric regulations, industry best practices, and the reshaping of law.</p>
<p>This topic is too big to cover in this article, but I can provide a good resource for you on privacy harm. One of my go-to resources when considering this issue is&nbsp;<a href="https://teachprivacy.com/">Daniel Solove</a>, who recently, along with Danielle Keates Citron, updated the&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3782222">Typology of Privacy Harms</a>. This is a must-read if you are a student on the topic of being of service to the connected individual.</p>
 The Customer Journey and Balance of Power Shift 
<p>To address these privacy harms, Surash specifically calls for the government to get involved. However, Surash thinks brands and individuals alike can do more as well. Surash makes it clear that individuals need to be more aware and accountable for their own actions and interactions. He also thinks, however, that brands need to learn to engage people in an even value exchange (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5WlrHSohpM&amp;t=774s">hear Surash’s comment</a>). Furthermore, he recognizes that people are taking more control of their data, and as this continues, we may eventually see the evolution of consumer “curation services &nbsp;(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5WlrHSohpM&amp;t=1527s">hear his remark</a>),” what may call “infomediaries.” Again, I’m drawn to the WPP quote above. Brands need to prepare for fundamental shifts in people’s attitudes and expectations. The implications of these shifts will be profound, as they will force a change in competition, business models, product offerings, and business practices.</p>
 There is Much We All Need to Know and Do 
<p>So, after taking all this in, what’s next?</p>
<p>What I learned from my time with Surash is that an effective identity management implementation can collectively save brands billions, while building trust and improving their ability to serve their customer throughout the customer’s journey.</p>
<p>Surash emphasized that the people must know that they are at risk and be aware of all that is going on in the industry. As a result of this knowledge, they can take steps to advocate for and protect themselves. He notes that individuals “absolutely need to know the value of their data” and “how they can challenge” the brands’ use of their data. Surash suggested that individuals need to start shifting the balance of power by approaching brands and questioning, “Do you really need that data to serve me? If not, don’t ask me for it.” Surash does recognize, however, that this is going to be hard for individuals to go up against the “large” brand. As noted below, we believe in both the companies’ and the government’s abilities to do more.</p>
<p>For brands, Surash wants them to:</p>
 
 Take cyberattacks seriously and prepare as the attacks are expected to get worse. 
 Get the fraud and marketing teams working together and not at loggerheads 
 Not just onboard individuals after the first transaction, but to continually evaluate and authenticate their customers as their customers move along the journey. He suggests that brands must learn to evaluate the local context of each engagement, regularly verify and authenticate their customers, and show the people they serve some respect by making an effort to validate if individuals’ circumstances (preferences, address, phone number, etc.) have changed over time. Surash implies that these actions will both reduce the risk of fraud and cybercrime, but also improve the relationship they have with those they serve. 
 Ensure there is always an even value exchange, and if the brand wants more in return during a transaction, e.g.&nbsp;more data to support a future upsell, then they should consider paying the individual for it. 
 
<p>As for public institutions, .e.g. governments, Surash suggests that “there isn’t enough being done to protect the consumers.” Governments should work with industry to refine value propositions, institute consistent standards, and advocate for consumers.</p>
<p>Clearly, this is all just the tip of the iceberg. There is definitely more to come.</p>

<p>Sunday, November 14, 2021</p>



<p>We got an early start, said good-bye to Celeste (who got to stay in the room a little longer), and headed for Paddington Station about 7 am to catch the <a href="https://www.heathrowexpress.com/#/">Heathrow Express</a>. We bought our tickets, got out on the platform, and were greeted with a message board saying that there were delays on the line and that some trains had been canceled. This made us a little nervous, but the Network Rail application on my phone reassured us that there would, in fact, be a train soon. Although we had a bit more than the usual wait for Heathrow Express, the train proceeded normally and was not excessively crowded.</p>



<p>After the usual long walk, we reached the ticket counter and checked in. They were thorough in checking our vaccination and COVID testing status, although not to the point of actually checking the QR codes associated with each. After checking bags, there was another long walk to the vicinity of the gate. United’s lounge in London is still closed, but in the meantime they have an arrangement with Singapore Airlines for the use of their lounge where we were able to get breakfast.</p>



<p>At the gate, Kenna was diverted for extra security screening because the “SSSS” designation was printed on her boarding pass. Following that inconvenience, our flight departed on time, which given that we have only a 2-hour layover in Chicago (including customs and immigration) we appreciated. However, our arrival gate was occupied by another plane, resulting in about a 30 minute delay which made us understandably nervous.</p>



<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2021/12/img_7860.jpg"></a>Greenland from the air



<p>Having seen US Customs signs back in San Francisco promoting the <a href="https://mobilepassport.us/">Mobile Passport</a> immigration application for our phones, we entered our passport information and customs declaration. But after racing to the immigration hall, we were told, “We don’t use that any more. Get in line.” More nervousness about the time. After getting through Customs (which left us outside security), we took the tram to Terminal 1 for our flight to San Francisco.</p>



<p>Here we noticed that Kenna didn’t have the TSA Precheck designation on her boarding card, probably as a result of the SSSS designation earlier. It may not have mattered; there were signs saying precheck was closed and the people checking boarding passes didn’t seem to know. So we both went through the “slow line”, and unfortunately Kenna set something off and had to go through some extra screening. Apparently they thought there was something about one of her shoes, which they ran through the X-ray machine again; more delay. It was interesting that there were a number of women having their shoes rechecked at the same time.</p>



<p>We raced to our gate, nearly the furthest from the security checkpoint, and made it in enough time, but with not much to spare. The ride to San Francisco was unremarkable, and we collected our bags and caught our ride home, according to plan.</p>



 Epilogue 



  
<p>Arriving home we were severely jet lagged as expected, but tried to stay up as late as we could manage. After a few hours of sleep, I awoke about 2 am. I could hear some water dripping, which I attributed to a downspout being clogged with leaves following some recent rainfall. So I got up to investigate, and instead discovered that there was a substantial amount of water dripping from the ceiling into our guest room. It turns out that a hot water pipe in the attic had developed a pinhole leak and over time had soaked one wall. So we now have a new project.</p>

<p>Saturday, November 13, 2021</p>



<p>London isn’t in Sussex, that’s just the theme of the trip.</p>



<p>Celeste expressed a lot of interest in visiting the <a href="https://www.iwm.org.uk/visits/iwm-london">Imperial War Museum</a>, which none of us had visited, so we decided to make that our first destination. After a quick <a href="https://www.pret.co.uk/en-GB">Pret a Manger</a> breakfast, we took the Tube to the south side of London. The first thing you notice is the battleship guns at the front. My interest was also piqued by a short segment of Berlin Wall near the front entrance.</p>



<p>The museum has a large collection on several floors, with areas emphasizing World War I, World War II, the Cold War, the Holocaust, etc. One could easily spend several days to see all of the exhibits. Toward the end of our visit, we went in to the World War II gallery (having already seen quite a number of exhibits dealing with WW II), and it went on…and on. The gallery was very large and went into great detail, including many stories about participants in the war, German as well as Allied. We hadn’t expected the gallery to be nearly as large as it was, and might have allocated more time if we had.</p>



<p>Early in the afternoon we tired of the museum and decided to look for lunch. We thought we might like German food, so guided by our phones, we walked north and came to <a href="https://www.mercatometropolitano.com/">Mercato Metropolitano</a>, a large semi-outdoor food court with sustainable food from many world cuisines. Each of us selected something we like, but we never found the German restaurant we thought was there.</p>



<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2021/12/img_7846x-1.jpg"></a>



<p>Continuing north, we got to the <a href="https://boroughmarket.org.uk/">Borough Market</a>, a large trading market established in 1756. Perhaps because it was a Saturday, it was very crowded. Normally this might not have been as notable but that since the COVID epidemic we have avoided and become unaccustomed to crowds. We walked through quickly and then continued on to the Thames, where we went along the south shore to the Millennium Bridge. We walked out on the bridge, took some pictures, and continued west to the Westminster Bridge. All along the way there were people — lots of people.</p>



<p>After crossing the Westminster bridge, we took a short Tube ride to the West End. Again, everything was crowded. We tried a couple of places for dinner, but nothing was available without an advance booking. The Five Guys burger restaurant was jammed, and there was even a long queue at McDonalds (!). We couldn’t figure out the attraction there.</p>



<p>We finally settled on <a href="https://www.itsu.com/">Itsu</a>, the same Asian-themed fast food chain that we had tried in Brighton. We were able to find a table and had an enjoyable light meal.</p>



  
<p>The big event of the day was this evening: we had tickets to <a href="https://www.backtothefuturemusical.com/">Back to the Future: The Musical</a>, playing at the <a href="https://lwtheatres.co.uk/theatres/adelphi/">Adelphi Theatre</a> on The Strand. This is a new show that that just opened in July 2021 and has not yet made it to the United States. The theatre was, as expected, nearly full. But we had been told that COVID vaccination, negative tests, and the wearing of masks would be required. In fact, we were never asked about vaccinations or tests, and the majority of the audience did not wear masks. We felt somewhat less safe as a result.</p>
  



<p>Still, the show was very enjoyable. As Celeste pointed out, this is a “tech show” with the strong point being special effects. Most of the performances, particularly Doc Brown, were excellent as well, although Celeste noted that some of the actors had trouble with American accents.</p>



<p>We took the Tube back to our hotel and are retiring quickly. Tomorrow will be an early day for Jim and Kenna’s flight back home.</p>

<p>Friday, November 12, 2021</p>



<p>Since it is now 2 days before our return to the United States, today was the day for our pre-trip COVID test. We were a little nervous about that because, of course, it determines whether we return as planned. Expecting a similar experience as for our Day 2 test, we were a bit surprised that this time we would have to do a proctored test where the proctor would watch us take the test via video chat. The next surprise was that you seem to need both a smartphone to run their app and some other device for the chat session. So we got out our iPads, and (third surprise) there was apparently a bug in their application causing it not to work on an iPad. So we got out my Mac laptop and (fourth surprise) couldn’t use my usual browser, Firefox, but could fortunately use Safari. Each test took about half an hour, including a 15-minute wait for the test to develop. Following the wait, a second video chat was set up where they read the test with you and issued your certificate. Very fortunately, both of our tests were negative.</p>



<p>We checked out of the apartment/hotel just before checkout time and stored our bags. Then the question was what to do until Celeste finished classes so we could all take the train to London. The answer was the <a href="https://www.visitsealife.com/brighton/">Sea Life Brighton</a>, apparently the oldest aquarium in the world. While not an extensive collection, many of the exhibits were in a classic style with ornate frames supporting the glass windows. There was a very enjoyable tunnel where you can sit while fish (and turtles!) swim overhead. The aquarium covered a number of regions of the world, with more of an emphasis on fresh-water fish than many others we have seen.</p>




<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2021/12/img_7817.jpg"></a>



<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2021/12/img_7828-1.jpg"></a>




<p>After browsing a bookstore for a while, we collected our bags and headed for the train station. Trains run to Victoria Station in London every half hour, and fortunately that connected well with the train Celeste took from Falmer to meet us.</p>



<p>After the train trip and Tube ride to Paddington Station, we walked the short distance to our hotel, a newly renovated boutique hotel called <a href="https://www.inhabithotels.com/">Inhabit</a>. We chose it largely because it had nice triple rooms, including an actual bed (not sofa bed) for Celeste. No London trip would be complete without a hotel where it’s necessary to lug your bags up a flight of stairs, but fortunately this one only required a single flight. Our room was modern and comfortable.</p>



<p>I had booked a table at the <a href="https://www.victoriapaddington.co.uk/">Victoria</a>, a pub in the Paddington area, and we were seated in a pleasant and not noisy dining room upstairs. Dinner was excellent. Upon returning to the hotel, Celeste immediately collapsed for the night on her cozy bed.</p>

<p>Thursday, November 11, 2021</p>



<p>While Celeste was in classes, Kenna and I set out on foot for Hove, Brighton’s “twin” city to the west. We had a rather pleasant walk through a shopping district, but there wasn’t much remarkable to see. In Hove, we turned south and followed the main road along the Channel back to the west. We stopped to look at one of the characteristic crescent-shaped residential developments, and continued toward Brighton. We considered going on the <a href="https://britishairwaysi360.com/">i360</a> observation tower, but it wasn’t particularly clear and the expense didn’t seem worth it.</p>



<p>Celeste and a friend of hers (another exchange student from Colorado) joined us in the afternoon to go ice skating at the <a href="https://royalpavilionicerink.co.uk/">Royal Pavilion Ice Rink</a>. While I am used to hockey skates, it was a bit of an adjustment to the others who are used to the toe picks on figure skates. We all got the hang of it; the ice was beautifully maintained (although with some puddles) and the rink was not particularly crowded for our 3 pm session.</p>

<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2021/12/img_4511.jpeg"></a>




<p>After skating we sat in the attached cafe to chat until it was time for dinner, which we had at an Italian restaurant, <a href="https://www.bellaitalia.co.uk/italian-restaurant/brighton/market-street#!">Bella Italia</a>, in the Lanes.</p>

<p>Wednesday, November 10, 2021</p>



<p>Celeste has a busy class schedule the early part of the day, so Kenna and I set out on our own, first for a hearty breakfast at <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186273-d467437-Reviews-Billie_s_Cafe-Brighton_East_Sussex_England.html">Billie’s Cafe</a> and then to the <a href="https://brightonmuseums.org.uk/royalpavilion/">Royal Pavilion</a>, one of the sightseeing highlights of Brighton. Originally a country estate, it was remodeled by King George IV into an ornate building, with the exterior having an Indian theme and the interior extensively decorated and furnished in Chinese style.</p>



<p>Brighton’s Royal Pavilion has had a varied history, having been of less interest to Queen Victoria (George IV’s successor in the throne) who moved most of the furnishings to London and sold the building to the City of Brighton. Over the years it has been refurnished in the original style and with many of the original furnishings, some of which have been loaned by Queen Elizabeth. The Pavilion was in the process of being decorated for Christmas, which reminded us of a visit we made two years ago to <a href="https://filoli.org/">Filoli</a> in California.</p>




<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2021/11/img_7769.jpg"></a>



<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2021/11/img_7770-1.jpg"></a>




<p>After the Pavilion, we went across the garden to the Brighton Museum, which had a wide range of exhibits ranging from ancient history of the British Isles and ancient Egypt to LGBT styles of the late 20th century and modern furniture.</p>



<p>Having finished her classes, Celeste joined us for lunch at <a href="https://www.itsu.com/">Itsu</a>, one of a chain of Asian-inspired fast food restaurants. We then returned with Celeste to the museum to see a bit more and allow her time to do some research she had planned.</p>



<p>We then made our way behind the Pavilion, where a seasonal ice rink is set up for recreational ice skating. With its location next to the Pavilion it is a particularly scenic place to skate. We are looking forward to doing that tomorrow.</p>



<p>Celeste returned to campus, and Kenna and I, having had a substantial lunch, opted for a light dinner at <a href="https://www.tengreenbottles.com/">Ten Green Bottles</a>, a local wine bar.</p>

  The title might sound like a movie but this article is about unpacking decision making.  <br><br>We need leaders to be confident in their decisions so we can hold them accountable.  We desire leaders to lead, wanting them to be early. They achieve this by listening to the signals and reacting before is is obvious to the casual observer.  However, those in leadership who we hold accountable do not want to make the “wrong” decisions. A wrong decision can mean liability, loss of reputation or perceived to be too risky.  A long senior leadership career requires navigating a careful path between not takingtoo much risk by going too “early”, which leads to failure, and not being late such that anyone could have made the decision earlier and looking incompetent.  Easy leadership does not look like leadership as it finds a path of not being early or late (the majority)<br><br><br><br>When we unpack leadership trends over the past 100 years that include ideas such as improving margin, diversification, reduction, speed to market, finance lead decisions, data-led, customer first, agile, just-in-time, customer centricity, digital first, personalisation, automated decisions, innovation, transformation, ethics, diversity, privacy by design, shareholder primacy, stakeholder management, re-engineering, outsourcing to name a few.  Over the same period of time our ideas of leadership styles has also evolved. <br><br><a href="https://draft.blogger.com/#"></a><br><br>There is an inference or hypothesis that we can test, which is that our approach to risk means we have the leaders that we now deserve.

<p>Tuesday, November 9, 2021</p>



<p>Somewhat at the midpoint of our trip, it was time to take care of a few things like laundry. It’s also time for the thrice-annual <a href="https://www.ietf.org/">Internet Engineering Task Force</a> meeting, which was supposed to be in Madrid, but is being held online (again) due to the pandemic. I co-chaired a session from noon to 2 pm local time today, so I needed to be at the hotel for that. Meanwhile Kenna and Celeste did some exploring around the little shops in the Brighton Lanes.</p>



<p>Our downtime day also gave us an opportunity to do some laundry. One of the attractive features of our “aparthotel” is a compact combination washer/dryer. Our room also came with a couple of detergent pods, which were unfortunately and unexpectedly heavily scented. We will be using our own detergent in the future. The dryer was slow, but it did the job.</p>



<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2021/11/img_4493x.jpg"></a>IETF virtual venue



<p>I am again thankful for the good internet service here; the meeting went without a hitch (my co-chair is in Melbourne, Australia). Kenna and Celeste brought lunch from <a href="https://www.pret.co.uk/en-GB">Pret a Manger</a> to eat between meeting sessions I needed to attend. Following the second session we went off for dinner at a pizza place we had discovered, <a href="https://www.francomanca.co.uk/">Franco Manca</a>. The pizza and surroundings were outstanding; we would definitely return (and Celeste probably will). We then saw Celeste off to her bus back to campus and we returned to our hotel.</p>

<p>A little over a year ago, I switched roles at Oracle and joined the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Product Management team working on Identity and Access Management (IAM) services. It's been an incredibly interesting (and challenging) year leading up to our release of <a href="https://www.oracle.com/security/cloud-security/identity-cloud/">OCI IAM identity domains</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>We merged an enterprise-class Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS) solution with our OCI-native IAM service to create a cloud platform IAM service unlike any other. We encountered numerous challenges along the way that would have been much easier if we allowed for customer interruption. But we had a key goal to not cause any interruptions or changes in functionality to our thousands of existing IDaaS customers. It's been immeasurably impressive to watch the development organization attack and conquer those challenges.<br></p><p>Now, with a few clicks from the OCI admin console, customers can create self-contained IDaaS instances to accommodate a variety of IAM use-cases. And this is just the beginning. The new, upgraded OCI IAM service serves as the foundation for what's to come. And I've never been more optimistic about Oracle's future in the IAM space.</p><p>Here's a short excerpt from our blog post <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/cloudsecurity/post/introducing-oci-iam-identity-domains">Introducing OCI IAM Identity Domains</a>:<br></p><p></p><blockquote><p>"Over the past five years, Oracle Identity  Cloud Service (IDCS) has grown to support thousands of customers and  currently manages hundreds of millions of identities. Current IDCS  customers enjoy a broad set of Identity and Access Management (IAM)  features for authentication (federated, social, delegated, adaptive, multi-factor authentication (MFA)), access management, manual or automated identity lifecycle and entitlement management, and single sign-on (SSO) (federated, gateways, proxies, password vaulting).</p> <p>In addition to serving IAM use cases for workforce and consumer  access scenarios, IDCS has frequently been leveraged to enhance IAM  capabilities for <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/">Oracle Cloud Infrastructure</a>&nbsp;(OCI) workloads. The <a href="https://www.oracle.com/security/cloud-security/identity-cloud/">OCI Identity and Access Management (OCI IAM)</a> service, a native OCI service that provides the access control plane  for Oracle Cloud resources (networking, compute, storage, analytics,  etc.), has provided the IAM framework for OCI via authentication, access  policies, and integrations with OCI security approaches such as <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingcompartments.htm">compartments and tagging</a>.  OCI customers have adopted IDCS for its broader authentication options,  identity lifecycle management capabilities, and to provide a seamless  sign-on experience for end users that extends beyond the Oracle Cloud.</p> <p>To better address Oracle customers’ IAM requirements and to simplify  access management across Oracle Cloud, multi-cloud, Oracle enterprise  applications, and third-party applications, Oracle has merged IDCS and  OCI IAM into a single, unified cloud service that brings all of IDCS’  advanced identity and access management features natively into the OCI  IAM service. To align with Oracle Cloud branding, the unified IAM  service will leverage the OCI brand and will be offered as OCI IAM. Each instance of the OCI IAM service will be managed as identity domains in the OCI console."</p></blockquote><p></p><p><a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/cloudsecurity/post/introducing-oci-iam-identity-domains">Learn more about OCI IAM identity domains</a> <br></p>

<p>Monday, November 8, 2021</p>



<p>We started our day fairly early, getting a quick Starbucks breakfast before getting on the bus to University of Sussex to meet Celeste at 9:30 am. Celeste has an hour-long radio show, “Oops That Had Banjos”, on the campus radio station, <a href="https://www.urfonline.com/">University Radio Falmer</a>. She invited us to co-host the show. The studio was exactly as I had imagined, and it was a lot of fun doing the show with her. We each contributed a couple of songs to the playlist, and got to introduce them briefly.</p>



<p>After the show, Celeste had classes so we continued on to Lewes. We hadn’t been able to see much on our short visit Sunday evening. We started out at <a href="https://sussexpast.co.uk/attraction/lewes-castle-museum/">Lewes Castle &amp; Museum</a>, again getting an idea of the history of the place and then visiting portions of the castle itself. It was a clear day, and the view from the top was excellent. As with many of these sites, the castle went through many changes through the centuries as political conditions changed.</p>

<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2021/11/img_7759-1.jpg"></a>
Lewes Barbican Gate and view from the Castle



<p>After climbing around the castle, we were ready for lunch. We checked out a few restaurants in town before settling on the Riverside Cafe, in an attractive area on the River Ouse. After lunch, we walked among a number of small shops before entering a <a href="https://www.waterstones.com/">Waterstones bookstore</a>. How we miss spending time in quality bookstores! I expect we’ll be seeking them out more once we return.</p>



<p>We then took the train back to Brighton, since I had a meeting to attend for work. The meeting went well; the internet connection at the hotel is solid and makes it seem like it hardly matters where in the world I am when attending these meetings.</p>



<p>Celeste came down to Brighton to have dinner with us. We decided to go with Latin American food at a local chain called Las Iguanas. The food was quite good although somewhat standard, at least to those of us from California and Colorado.</p>

  <p>Update Feb 04, 2022: It looks like I was entirely correct with this November post.
Facebook is out of new users, over 10 billion in metaverse investments have nothing to
show for it yet, and the markets have caught up, dropping the stock by $200 billion in a
day. To make things worse, Zuckerberg supposedly said “focus on video” in the all-hands
on the same day. He chickened out; he should have doubled down on the metaverse story if
he truly believes it. But he did not.</p>
<p>The more I think about Facebook’s Meta’s pivot to the metaverse, the less it appears
like they do this voluntarily. I think they have no other choice: their existing
business is running out of steam. Consider:</p>
 
 
<p>At about
<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/">3.5 billion month active users</a>
of at least one of their products (Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp etc),
they are running out of more humans to sign up.</p>
 
 
<p>People say they use Facebook to
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2011/12/22/using-social-media-to-keep-in-touch/">stay in touch with family and friends</a>.
But there is now one ad in my feed for each three or four posts that I actually want to
see. Add more ads than this, and users will turn their backs: Facebook doesn’t help
them with what they want help with any more, it’s all ads.</p>
 
 
<p>While their ARPU is <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/251328/facebooks-average-revenue-per-user-by-region/">much higher in the US</a>
than in Europe, where in turn it is much higher than the rest of the world – hinting that
international growth should be possible – their distribution of ARPU is not all that
different from the whole ad market’s
<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/258071/global-advertising-spending-by-region/">distribution of ad revenues in different regions</a>.
Convincing, say, Africa to spend much more on ads does not sound like a growth story.</p>
 
 
<p>And between the regulators in the EU and elsewhere, moves to effectively ban further
Instagram-like acquisitions, lawsuits left and right, and Apple’s privacy moves, their
room to manoever is getting tighter, not wider.</p>
 
 
<p>Their current price/sales ratio of <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FB/key-statistics?p=FB">just under 10</a>
is hard to be justified for long under these constraints. They must also be telling themselves
that relying on an entirely ad-based business model is not good long-term strategy any
more, given the backlash against surveillance capitalism.</p>
<p>So what do you do?</p>
<p>I think you change the fundamentals of your business at the same time you change the
conversation, leveraging the technology you own. And you end up with:</p>
 
 
<p>Oculus as the replacement for the mobile phone;</p>
 
 
<p>Headset and app store sales, for Oculus, as an entirely new business model that’s
been proven (by the iPhone) to be highly profitable and is less under attack by regulators
and the public; it also supports potentially much higher ARPU than just ads;</p>
 
 
<p>Renaming the company to something completely harmless and bland sounding; that will also
let you drop the Facebook brand should it become too toxic down the road.</p>
 
 
<p>The risks are immense, starting with: how many hours a day do you hold your mobile phone
in your hand, in comparison to how many hours a day you are willing to wear a bucket
on your head, ahem, a headset? Even fundamental interaction questions, architecture questions
and use case questions for the metaverse are still completely up in the air.</p>
<p>Credit to Mark Zuckerberg for pulling off a move as substantial as this for an
almost trillion dollar company. I can’t think of any company which has ever done anything
similar at this scale. When Intel pivoted from memory to CPUs, back in the 1980’s and at
a much smaller scale, at least it was clear that there was going to be significant, growing
demand for CPUs. This is not clear at all about headsets beyond niches such as gaming.
So they are really jumping into the unknown with both feet.</p>
<p>But I don’t think any more they had a choice.</p>

<p>Having gone west to <a href="https://altmode.org/2021/11/27/sussex-day-3-chichester-and-fishbourne/">Chichester</a> yesterday, today we went east to Hastings, notable for the Norman conquest of 1066 (although the actual Battle of Hastings was some distance inland). We arranged to meet Celeste on the train as we passed through Falmer, where her campus is located, for the hour-or-so trip along the coast. Unfortunately, it seems like it’s an hour train ride to most sights outside Brighton.</p>



<p>Hastings is an attractive and somewhat touristy town, along the Channel and in a narrow valley surrounded by substantial hills. We walked through the town, stopping for a fish and chips lunch along the way, and admiring the small shops in the Old Town. We took a funicular up one of the two hills and had an excellent view of the surrounding terrain. Unfortunately, the ruins of the castle at Hastings were closed for the season.<br><br></p>




<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2021/11/img_7744.jpg"></a>



<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2021/11/img_7741-1.jpg"></a>
Funicular and view from the top



<p>After returning via funicular, we continued through the town to the <a href="http://www.hmag.org.uk/">Hastings Museum</a>, a well curated (and free!) small museum that was thorough in its coverage of the history of the area, from the Iron Age to the present. It also included an extensive collection from a local family that sailed around the world in the 1800s.</p>



<p>Taking the train back, we had a change of trains in Lewes, which Celeste had visited and enjoyed previously. We stopped at the Lewes Arms pub, but unfortunately (since it was Sunday evening) the kitchen had closed so we couldn’t get food. So Celeste returned to campus and got dinner there, while Kenna and I got take-out chicken sandwiches to eat in our hotel.</p>



<p>Our weekly family Zoom conference is on Sunday evening, England time, so we ate our sandwiches while chatting with other family members back home. It’s so much easier to stay in close touch with family while traveling than it was just a few years ago.</p>

<p>I’ve spent quite a few hours evenings and weekends recently building out a
comprehensive suite of <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/sqitch/actions">GitHub Actions for Sqitch</a>. They cover a dozen versions
of Perl, nearly 70 database versions amongst nine database engines, plus a
coverage test and a release workflow. A pull request can expect over 100 actions
to run. Each build requires over 100 direct dependencies, plus all their
dependencies. Installing them for every build would make any given run
untenable.</p>
<p>Happily, GitHub Actions include a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/advanced-guides/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows" title="GitHub Actions: “Caching dependencies to speed up workflows”">caching feature</a>, and thanks to a
<a href="https://github.com/shogo82148/actions-setup-perl/pull/892">recent improvement to shogo82148/actions-setup-perl</a>,
it’s quite easy to use in a version-independent way. Here’s an example:</p>
  <code>name: Test
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  OS:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ ubuntu, macos, windows ]
        perl: [ 'latest', '5.34', '5.32', '5.30', '5.28' ]
    name: Perl ${{ matrix.perl }} on ${{ matrix.os }}
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Source
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Setup Perl
        id: perl
        uses: shogo82148/actions-setup-perl@v1
        with: { perl-version: "${{ matrix.perl }}" }
      - name: Cache CPAN Modules
        uses: actions/cache@v2
        with:
          path: local
          key: perl-${{ steps.perl.outputs.perl-hash }}
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: cpm install --verbose --show-build-log-on-failure --no-test --cpanfile cpanfile
      - name: Run Tests
        env: { PERL5LIB: "${{ github.workspace }}/local/lib/perl5" }
        run: prove -lrj4
</code>  <p>This workflow tests every permutation of OS and Perl version specified in
<code>jobs.OS.strategy.matrix</code>, resulting in 15 jobs. The <code>runs-on</code> value determines
the OS, while the <code>steps</code> section defines steps for each permutation. Let’s take
each step in turn:</p>
 
 “Checkout Source” checks the project out of GitHub. Pretty much required for
any project. 
 “Setup Perl” sets up the version of Perl using the value from the matrix.
Note the <code>id</code> key set to <code>perl</code>, used in the next step. 
 “Cache CPAN Modules” uses the <a href="https://github.com/actions/cache">cache action</a> to cache the directory named
<code>local</code> with the key <code>perl-${{ steps.perl.outputs.perl-hash }}</code>. The key
lets us keep different versions of the <code>local</code> directory based on a unique
key. Here we’ve used the <code>perl-hash</code> output from the <code>perl</code> step defined
above. The <code>actions-setup-perl</code> action outputs this value, which contains a
hash of the output of <code>perl -V</code>, so we’re tying the cache to a very specific
version and build of Perl. This is important since compiled modules are not
compatible across major versions of Perl. 
 “Install Dependencies” uses <a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/App-cpm/view/script/cpm" title="cpm - a fast CPAN module installer"><code>cpm</code></a> to quickly install Perl dependencies. By
default, it puts them into the <code>local</code> subdirectory of the current directory
— just where we configured the cache. On the first run for a given OS and
Perl version, it will install all the dependencies. But on subsequent runs
it will find the dependencies already present, thank to the cache, and
quickly exit, reporting “All requirements are satisfied.” In <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/sqitch/runs/4275487924?check_suite_focus=true">this Sqitch
job</a>, it takes less than a second. 
 “Run Tests” runs the tests that require the dependencies. It requires the
<code>PERL5LIB</code> environment variable to point to the location of our cached
dependencies. 
 
<p>That’s the whole deal. The first run will be the slowest, depending on the
number of dependencies, but subsequent runs will be much faster, up to the
seven-day caching period. For a complex project like Sqitch, which uses the same
OS and Perl version for most of its actions, this results in a tremendous build
time savings. CI configurations we’ve used in the past often took an hour or
more to run. Today, most builds take only a few minutes to test, with longer
times determined not by dependency installation but by container and database
latency.</p>

<p>Saturday, November 6, 2021</p>



<p>After a pleasant breakfast at a cafe in The Lanes, we met up with Celeste at the Brighton train station and rode to Chichester, about an hour to the west. Chichester is a pleasant (and yes, touristy) town with a notable cathedral. Arriving somewhat late, we walked through the town and then found lunch at a small restaurant on a side road as many of the major restaurants in town were quite crowded (it is a Saturday, after all).<br><br><br><br></p>



  
<p>One of the main attractions in the area is the <a href="https://sussexpast.co.uk/attraction/fishbourne-roman-palace-gardens/">Fishbourne Roman Palace</a>, one village to the west. We set out on foot, through a bit of rain, for a walk of a couple of miles. But when we arrived it was well worth the trip. This is an actual Roman palace, constructed in about 79AD, that had been uncovered starting in the 1960s, along with many coins, implements, and other artifacts. The mosaic floors were large and particularly impressive. As a teenager, I got to visit the ruins in Pompeii; these were of a similar nature. This palace and surrounding settlements were key to the Roman development of infrastructure in England.</p>
  



  
<p>Returning from Fishbourne to Chichester, we made a short visit to <a href="https://www.chichestercathedral.org.uk/">Chichester Cathedral</a>. Unfortunately, the sun had set and it was difficult to see most of the stained glass. At the time of our visit, there was a <a href="https://www.chichestercathedral.org.uk/news/50000-people-visited-luke-jerrams-museum-moon-chichester-cathedral">large model of the Moon</a>, traveling to several locations in Europe, that was hanging from the ceiling in the middle of the church. It was a striking thing to see, especially as we first entered.</p>

<p>After our train trip back from Chichester, we parted with Celeste who returned to campus. Since it was a Saturday night, restaurants were crowded, but we were able to get dinner at a large chain pub, <a href="https://www.jdwetherspoon.com/pubs/all-pubs/england/east-sussex/the-post--telegraph-brighton">Wetherspoons</a>. The pub was noisy and table service was minimal. We ordered via their website and they only cleared the previous patrons’ dirty dishes when they delivered our food. The food was acceptable, but nothing to blog about.</p>

<p>A Reader’s&nbsp;Guide</p><p>How should crypto be regulated? And by whom? These are the big questions the industry is grappling with in the wake of the infrastructure bill being signed with the haphazardly expanded definition of a broker dealer for tax reporting provisions. So now the industry is *atwitter* with ideas about where to go from&nbsp;here.</p><p>Three large companies have all come out with policy suggestions: FTX, Coinbase and and A16z. While these proposals differ in approach, they all seek to address a few central policy questions. I’ll break down the proposals based on key subject&nbsp;areas:</p><p>Consumer Protection</p><p>A16: Suggests a framework for DAO’s to provide disclosures.</p><p>Coinbase: Sets a goal to “​​Enhance transparency through appropriate disclosure requirements. Protect against fraud and market manipulation”</p><p>FTX: Similarly suggests framework for “disclosure and transparency standards”</p><p>All three of these make ample mention of consumer protections that seem to begin and end at disclosures. Regulators might want something with a little more teeth. FTX provides a more robust outline for combating fraud, suggesting the use of on-chain analytics tools. This is a smart and concrete suggestion of how to improve existing regulation that relies on SARS reports filed AFTER suspicious activity.</p><p>Exactly how Decentralized?</p><p>A16: Seeks to create a definition and entity status for DAO’s, which would ostensibly require a different kind of regulation than more custodial services.</p><p>Coinbase: ​Platforms and services that do not custody or otherwise control the assets of a customer — including miners, stakers and developers — would need to be treated differently</p><p>FTX- Doesn’t mention decentralization.</p><p>These are really varied approaches. I’m not criticizing FTX here, they are focusing on consumer protections and combating fraud which are good things to highlight. However the core regulatory issues is- can we differentiate between decentralized and centralized products and does that create a fundamentally conflict with existing law. A16z’s approach is novel, a new designation without a new&nbsp;agency.</p><p>The Devil You Know vs The Devil you&nbsp;Don’t</p><p>A16- Suggests the Government Office of Accountability “assess the current state of regulatory jurisdiction over cryptocurrency, digital assets, and decentralized technology, and to compare the costs and benefits of harmonizing jurisdiction among agencies against vesting supervision and oversight with a federally chartered self-regulatory organization or one or more nonprofit corporations.”</p><p>Coinbase- Argues that this technology needs a new regulatory agency and that all digital assets should be under a single regulatory authority. Also suggests coordination with a Self Regulatory Organization.</p><p>FTX- Doesn’t step into that&nbsp;morass.</p><p>Coinbase has the most aggressive position here. I personally am not convinced of the need for a new regulatory agency. We haven’t tried it the old fashioned way yet, where existing agencies offer clarity about what would bring a digital asset into their jurisdiction and what would exclude it. Creating a new agency is a slow and expensive process. And then that agency would need to justify its existence by aggressively cracking down. It’s a bit like creating a hammer and then inevitably complaining that it sees everything as a&nbsp;nail.</p><p>How to achieve regulatory change in the US for&nbsp;crypto:</p>  Stop tweeting aggressively at the people who regulate you. Negative points if you are a billionaire complaining about&nbsp;taxes.  Spend some time developing relationships with policymakers and working collaboratively with communities you want to support. Lotta talk of unbanked communities- any stats on how they are being served by this tech? (Seriously please&nbsp;share)  Consider looking at who is already doing the work you want to accelerate and consider working with them/learning from and supporting existing efforts rather than whipping out your proposal and demanding attention. Examples: CoinCenter, Blockchain Association. At the state level: <a href="https://www.blockadvocacy.org/">Blockchain Advocacy Coalition </a>of course, Cascadia Blockchain Council, Texas Blockchain Council&nbsp;etc.  <p>A16: <a href="https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/2021-09-27-andreessen-horowitz-senate-banking-proposals/ec055eb0ce534033/full.pdf#page=9">https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/2021-09-27-andreessen-horowitz-senate-banking-proposals/ec055eb0ce534033/full.pdf#page=9</a></p><p>Coinbase: <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/digital-asset-policy-proposal-safeguarding-americas-financial-leadership-ce569c27d86">https://blog.coinbase.com/digital-asset-policy-proposal-safeguarding-americas-financial-leadership-ce569c27d86</a>c</p><p>FTX: <a href="https://blog.ftx.com/policy/policy-goals-market-regulation/">https://blog.ftx.com/policy/policy-goals-market-regulation/</a></p>

<p>I just read a <a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/on-the-horizon-ftcs-slaughter-maps-data-regulations-potential-future">wonderful piece</a> from Joseph Duball,<a>1</a> who reported on the U.S. Federal Trade Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter’s keynote at the IAPP’s “Privacy. Security. Risk 2021” event. According to Duball, Slaughter suggests that we need to change “the way people view, prioritize, and conceptualize their data.”</p>
<p>“Too many services are about leveraging consumer data instead of straightforwardly providing value. For even the savviest users, the price of browsing the internet is being tracked across the web.” – Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, Commissioner, U.S. Federal Trade Commission 2021<a>2</a></p>
<p>According to Slaughter, privacy issues within data-driven markets stem from surveillance capitalism, which is fueled by indiscriminate data collection practices. She suggests that the remedy to curtail these practices is to focus on “purpose and use” restrictions and limitations rather than solely relying on the notice &amp; choice framework. In other words, in the future industry may no longer justify data practice with explanations like “they opted in” and “we got consent” or falling ba</p>
<p>“Collection and use limitations can help protect people’s rights. It should not be necessary to trade one’s data away as a cost of full participation in society and the modern information economy.” – Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, Commissioner, U.S. Federal Trade Commission 2021<a>3</a></p>
 FTC Has Concerns Other Than Privacy 
<p>So that there is no uncertainty or doubt, however, Duball<a>4</a> reports that, while consumer privacy is a chief concern for the commission, it is not the primary concern to the exclusion of other concerns. The commission is also worried about algorithmic bias and “dark patterns” practices. In other words, it is not just about the data, it is about the methods used to “trick” people into giving it up and how it is processed and applied to business decision-making.</p>
 Takeaway 
<p>My takeaway is that it is time for organizations to take a serious look at revamping their end-to-end processes and tech-stacks. This is a c-suite leadership all-hands-on-deck moment. It will take years for the larger organizations to turn their flotilla in the right direction, and for the industry at large to sort everything out. However, rest asserted, the empowered person–the self-sovereign individual–is nigh and will sort it out for industry soon enough.</p>
<p>There is time, but not much, maybe three, five, or seven years, before the people will be equipped with the knowledge and tools to take back control of their data. It is already happening; just look at open banking in the UK. These new tools, aka personal information management systems, will enable people to granularly exchange data on their terms with their stated purpose of use, not the businesses. They will give them the power to process data in a way that protects them from bias or at least helps them know when it is happening.</p>
<p>Why should businesses care about all this? Well, I predict, as do many so I’m not too far out on a limb here, that in the not-too-distant future, the empowered, connected individual will walk with their wallet and only do business with those institutions that respect their sovereignty, both physically and digitally. So, to all out there, it is time, and it is time to prepare for the future.</p>

<p>No civilisation can exist or prosper without the rule of law. The rule of law cannot exist without a proper justice system. In India, criminals have a free reign as justice system is used as a tool to make victims succumb into unfair settlements or withdrawals. Unfortunately, the Indian justice system has gone caput and remains clogged with over 4+ crore cases pending in courts due to following core&nbsp;reasons.</p> Policy gap 1 — Only in India there is zero deterrence to&nbsp;perjury <p>a. In India, perjury law is taken very lightly. 99% of cases are full of lies, deceit and mockery of justice. Affidavits in India do not serve much purpose. There have been various judgments and cries from all levels of judiciary but in&nbsp;vain.</p><p>b. Perjury makes any case 10x more complex and consumes 20x more time to adjudicate. It is akin to allowing a bullock cart in the middle of express highway. It is nothing but an attack on justice delivery system. Historically, perjury used to be punished with death sentence and considered an equally serious crime as&nbsp;murder.</p><p>c. This is against the best international practices and does not make economic sense for&nbsp;India.</p> Policy gap 2 — India has no equivalent laws such as the U.S. Federal Rule 11 enacted in 1983 (as amendment in 1993) to curb the explosion of frivolous litigation. <p>The entire provision of rule 11 of U.S. federal rules can be summarized in the following manner:</p><p>It requires that a district court mandatorily sanction attorneys or parties who submit improper pleadings like pleadings with</p>  Improper purpose  Containing frivolous arguments  Facts or arguments that have no evidentiary support  Omissions and errors, misleading and crafty&nbsp;language  Baseless or unreasonable denials with non-application of&nbsp;mind  Negligence, failure to appear or unreasonable adjournments  <p>All developed countries like UK and Australia also have similar laws to combat frivolous litigation.</p> Police gap 3 — Only in India the lawyers are barred from contingent fee agreements under Bar council&nbsp;rules   Indian lawyers are incentivized to make cases go longer, add complexity and never end. Consequently, they super specialize and become innovators in creating alibis so that the case never&nbsp;ends.  Lawyers in India do not investigate or legally vet the case before&nbsp;filing.  There is no incentive to apply for torts claims or prosecute perjury and therefore there is no deterrence created.  Lawyers are supposed to be gate keepers to prevent frivolous litigation but in India it is actually opposite due to the perverse policy on contingent fee and&nbsp;torts.  <p>Economic modelling suggests that — contingent fee arrangements reduce frivolous suits when compared to hourly fee arrangements. The reasoning is simple: When an attorney’s compensation is based solely on success, as opposed to hours billed, there is great incentive to accept and prosecute only meritorious cases.</p><p>At least one empirical analysis concludes that — “hourly fees encourage the filing of low-quality suits and increase the time to settlement (i.e., contingency fees increase legal quality and decrease the time to settlement).”</p> Negative impact of the 3 policy&nbsp;gaps <p>1. Conviction rates in India are abysmally low below 10% whereas internationally between 60% — 100%.<a>[1]</a></p><blockquote>a. Japan — 99.97%</blockquote><blockquote>b. China — 98%</blockquote><blockquote>c. Russia — 90%</blockquote><blockquote>d. UK — 80%</blockquote><blockquote>e. US — between 65% and&nbsp;80%</blockquote><p>2. Globally the 80%-99% cases get settled before trial but India its actually opposite&nbsp;because</p>  There is absolutely no fear of law and perjury is a&nbsp;norm.  Lawyers have no interest in driving a settlement due to per appearance fee&nbsp;system.  There is an artificial limit of fee shifting (awarding costs), torts and there is no motivation of the part of judges to create deterrence.  <p>3. The contingent fee and tort cannot be enabled till such time the fraternity of lawyers can be relied upon for ethical and moral&nbsp;conduct.</p><p>— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —&nbsp;—</p><blockquote>Easy solution to complex&nbsp;problem</blockquote><p>— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —&nbsp;—</p> Policy 1 — Restricting perjury and making it a non-bailable offence will resolve 50% cases immediately <br>(i.e. 1.5 crore cases within 3&nbsp;months) <p>India must truly embrace “Satyam ev jayate” and make perjury a non-bailable offence. All lawyers and litigants should be given 3 month’s notice to refile their pleadings or settle the cases. They would have to face the mandatory consequences of false evidence or averments later found to be&nbsp;untrue.</p><p>There needs to be a basic expectation reset in Indian courts litigation — the filings are correct, and the lawyer is responsible for prima facie diligence and candor before courts. The role of judiciary is not to distinguish between truth and false but to determine the sequence of events, fix accountability and award penalties. Presenting false evidence or frivolous arguments must be seen as separate offence on its&nbsp;own.</p><blockquote>At a minimum IPC 195(1)(b)(i) must be removed that states the following –</blockquote><blockquote>“No Court shall take cognizance- of any offence punishable under any of the following sections of the IPC (45 of 1860), namely, sections 193 to 196 (both inclusive), 199, 200, 205 to 211 (both inclusive) and 228, when such offence is alleged to have been committed in, or in relation to, any proceeding in any&nbsp;Court”</blockquote><p>Because:</p>  This necessarily makes the judges party to the complaint and therefore all judges are reluctant to prosecute perjury.  This estoppel opens up possibility of corruption in judiciary and public&nbsp;offices.  The intention of this provision has clearly backfired. This restriction is unique to india and against the international norms   Policy 2 — Sanctions on lawyers to streamline the perverse incentives that plague Indian justice&nbsp;system <p>The courts in USA are mandated to compulsorily sanction lawyers for various professional misconduct in litigation (Federal rule 11 of civil procedure) like:</p><p>Remedies and sanctions for lawyer’s misconduct can be categorized into three&nbsp;groups.</p>  Sanctions and remedies for attorney misconduct which are available to public authorities. Such sanctions include professional discipline, criminal liability of lawyers who assist their clients in committing criminal acts, and judicially imposed sanctions such as for contempt of court. Professional discipline is generally the best known sanction for attorney misconduct.  Sanctions which are available to lawyers’ clients. For example, damages for attorney malpractice, forfeiture of an attorney’s fee, and judicial nullification of gifts or business transactions that breach a lawyer’s fiduciary duty to a&nbsp;client.  Remedies that may be available to third parties injured by a lawyer’s conduct on behalf of a client. These include injunctions against representing a client in violation of the lawyer’s duty to a third party, damages for breach of an obligation the attorney assumes to a non-client, and judicial nullification of settlements or jury verdicts obtained by attorney misconduct.   Policy 3 — Contingent Fee and Tort Law making judiciary 3x efficient. <blockquote>(needs perjury law as discussed above to&nbsp;unlock)</blockquote><p>In India Lawyers spend more time in making the case complex and lengthy based on “dehari system” while the western counterparts earn far more money by genuinely solving cases and creating real values for the country. The market economics based on judicial policy on regulating legal profession and ethics in India is however geared towards permanently clogging the system. 3 of the 4 stakeholders benefit by making the litigation never&nbsp;end.</p><p>There is a dire need for the system to be re-incentivized wherein the legal profession can generate 10x more value for the country in catching and penalizing law abusers. This in turn will also attract and create more talented lawyers because then they will be investing more time in investigating and preparing the cases to&nbsp;win.</p><p>Making perjury a non-bailable offence and rules for mandatorily sanctioning lawyer mis-conduct will unlock the contingent fee and tort law in&nbsp;India.</p><p>Allowing contingent fee for lawyers have four principal policy justifications</p><p>Firstly, such arrangements</p>  enable the impecunious (having no money) to obtain representation. Such persons cannot afford the costs of litigation unless and until it is successful. Even members of the middle- and upper-socioeconomic classes may find it difficult to pay legal fees in advance of success and collection of judgment.  This is particularly so today as litigation has become more complex, often involving suits against multiple parties or multinational entities, and concerning matters requiring expert scientific and economic evidence.  <p>Secondly,</p>  Contingent fee arrangements can help align the interests of lawyer and client, as both will have a direct financial stake in the outcome of the litigation.  <p>Third</p>  By predicating an attorney’s compensation on the success of a suit, the attorney is given incentive to function as gatekeeper, screening cases for both merit and sufficiency of proof, and lodging only those likely to&nbsp;succeed.  This provides as an important and genuine signal for litigants to understand the merit of their&nbsp;case.  <p>Fourth</p>  And more generally, all persons of sound mind should be permitted to contract freely, and restrictions on contingent fee arrangements inhibit this&nbsp;freedom.  <p>Three other reasons to justify unlocking of contingent fee:-</p>  Clients, particularly unsophisticated ones, may be unable to determine when an attorney has underperformed or acted irresponsibly;15 in these instances, an attorney’s reputation would be unaffected, and thus the risk of reputational harm would not adequately protect against malfeasance.  Even when clients are aware of an attorney’s poor performance or irresponsibility, they may lack the means, media, or credibility to effectively harm the attorney’s reputation.  The interests of attorney and client are more closely aligned, ceteris paribus, when fee arrangements are structured so as to minimize perverse incentives.   Why contingent fees reduce caseload: <p>Lesser cases better&nbsp;filing</p><p>Complainants get genuine advice about chances of winning. They do not file unless they get lawyer’s&nbsp;buy-in.</p>  Lawyers screen cases for merit and sufficiency of proof before&nbsp;filing.  Lawyers don’t pick up bad cases to manage reputation.  Comprehensive evidence gathering happens before Lawyer decides to file a&nbsp;case.  <p>Lawyers simplify case and only allege charges that can be sustained.</p>  Use simple and concise arguments for the&nbsp;judges.  Lawyers spend more time working hard outside the courts. Thus increasing case&nbsp;quality.  <p>Faster case proceedings</p>  Less adjournments and&nbsp;hearings  They do better preparation and take less adjournments.  Multiple steps get completed in single hearings.  They create urgency for clients to show up at every&nbsp;hearing.  Lawyers do not unnecessarily appeal and stay matters because they do not get paid per hearing and want quick&nbsp;results.  <p>Case withdrawals</p>  There are less takers if a lawyer drops a case when there are surprises by client which will adversely impact the&nbsp;outcome.  Lawyers persuade complainants to settle when appropriate.   Conclusions <p>With 3+ crore cases pending and a dysfunctional justice delivery there is a mass exodus of Ultra High Net worth Individuals (UHNIs) from India. There is an absolute urgent need for above reforms before the situation turns into a complete banana republic.</p><p>It is an absolute embarrassment and national shame to allow Indians to be blatant liars even in courts. Business and survival in India today is a race to the bottom just because there is no bar on falsehood and having corrupt values, it is near impossible to survive without being part of the same&nbsp;culture.</p><p>It is prayed that even more stricter laws be enacted than just global norms such that Indians can be trusted globally to never lie. It’s not just about Indian courts but they could be counted as the most truthful race even in foreign lands and command high respect globally.</p> Restoring justice&nbsp;delivery  Economic benefits of reform in perjury, contingent fee and legal&nbsp;ethics <p>1. Higher quality of litigation work.</p><p>2. Attract better talent to the profession due to higher profitability.</p><p>3. Create more jobs in the&nbsp;economy.</p><p>4. Offer higher pool of qualified people for judiciary.</p><p>5. Drastic reduction in corrupt or criminal activity due to fear of&nbsp;law.</p><p>6. Unlocking of trillions of dollars of wealth/resources stuck in litigation.</p><p>7. Better investment climate due to more reliability in business transactions.</p><p>8. Higher reliability in products and services.</p><p>9. Access to justice for&nbsp;all.</p><p>10.

     <p>In the week where the worlds “leaders” meet to discuss and agree on the future of our climate at&nbsp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_United_Nations_Climate_Change_Conference">#COP26</a>, I remain sceptical about agreements.&nbsp; At <a href="https://newsroom.unfccc.int/news/forest-leaders-to-cop22-climate-conference-the-forest-transformation-is-happening-now">#COP22 there was an agreement to halve deforestation by 2020</a>; we missed it, so we have moved the target out. &nbsp; Here is a <a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/conferences/past-conferences/past-conferences-overview">review of all the past COP meetings and outcomes.</a> It is hard to find any resources to compare previous agreements with achievements.&nbsp; Below is from the UN.&nbsp;</p><br><p><a href="https://unfccc.int/topics/science/workstreams/periodic-review#eq-1"></a></p><br><p>The reason I remain doubtful and sceptical is that the decision of 1.5 degrees is framed.&nbsp; We are optimising for a goal.&nbsp; In this case, we do not want to increase our global temperature beyond 1.5 degrees.&nbsp; Have you ever tried to heat water and stop the heating process such that a temperature target was reached. Critically you only have one go.&nbsp; &nbsp; Try it. Fill a pan with ice and set a target, say 38.4 degrees, use a thermometer and switch off the pan when you think the final temperature will be your target. Did you manage to get within 1.5 degrees of your target?&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/">Peak Paradox framework</a> forces us to think that we cannot optimise for one outcome, one goal, one target or for a one-dimensional framing. To do so would be to ignore other optimisations, visions, ideas or beliefs.&nbsp; When we optimise, for one thing, something else will not have an optimal outcome.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In business, we are asked to articulate a single purpose, one mission, the single justification that sets out a reason to exist.&nbsp; The more we as a board or senior leadership team optimise for “performance”, the more we become directional. Performance itself, along with the thinking that drives the best allocation of resources, means we are framed to optimise for an outcome. &nbsp; In social sciences and economics, this is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_dependence">path dependency</a>. &nbsp; The unintended consequences of our previous decisions that drive efficiency and effectiveness might not directly impact us, but another part of an interdependent system that, through several unconnected actions, will feed into our future decisions and outcomes.&nbsp; Complex system thinking highlights such causes and effects of positive and negative feedback loops.&nbsp;</p><p>By example. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dishwasher_detergent">Dishwasher tablets</a> make me more productive but make the water system less efficient by reducing the effectiveness of the <a href="https://www.ethicalconsumer.org/home-garden/shopping-guide/ethical-dishwasher-detergent">ecosystem</a>. However, I am framed by performance and my own efficiency; therefore, I have to optimise my time, and the dishwasher is a perfect solution.&nbsp; Indeed we are marketed that the dishwasher saves water and energy compared to other washing up techniques. The single narrow view of optimisation is straightforward and easy to understand.&nbsp; The views we hold on battery cars to mobile phones is framed as one of being more productive.&nbsp; Performance as a metric matters more than anything else, why because the story says performance creates economic activity that creates growth that means fewer people are in poverty.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“Performance” is a one-dimensional optimisation where economic activity based on financial outcomes wins.&nbsp; You and I are the agents of any increase in performance, and the losses in the equation of equilibrium are somewhere else in the system. We are framed and educated to doubt the long, complex link between the use of anti-bacterial wipes and someone else’s skin condition. Performance as a dimension for measurement creates an optimal outcome for one and a sub-optimal outcome for someone else.&nbsp;</p><p>Performance as a measure creates an optimal outcome for one and a sub-optimal outcome for someone else.&nbsp;</p><p>If it was just me, then the cause and effect relationship are hard to see, but when more of humanity optimises for performance, it is the scale at which we all lose that suddenly comes into effect. Perhaps it is time to question the simple linear ideas of one purpose, one measure, one mission, and try to optimise for different things simultaneously; however, that means simple political messages, tabloid headlines, and social-media-driven advertising will fail.&nbsp; Are leaders ready to lead, or do they enjoy too much power to do the right thing?</p> <br>

<p>Art- A call for New Industry Data Exchange Models, The Trust Chain, and A Connected Individual Transaction And Identity Scoring Scheme: An Interview with Virginie Debris of GMS</p>
<p>I recently sat down with Virginie Debris, the Chief Product Officer for <a href="https://www.gms-worldwide.com/">Global Messaging Service</a> (GMS) and Board Member of the <a href="https://mobileecosystemforum.com/about/global-board/">Mobile Ecosystem Forum</a>, to talk about personal data and identity (PD&amp;I). We had an enlightening discussion (<a href="https://youtu.be/ftJ_4800W2Y">see video of the interview: 46:16 min)</a>). The conversation took us down unexpected paths and brought several insights and recommendations to light.</p>
<p>In our interview, we discussed the role of personal data and identity and how enterprises use it to know and serve their customers and protect the enterprises’ interests. To my delight, we uncovered three ideas that could help us all better protect PD&amp;I and improve the market’s efficiency.</p>
 
 Idea One: Build out and refine “The Trust Chain”, or “chain of trust,” a PD&amp;I industry value chain framework envisioned by Virginie. 
 Idea Two: Refine PD&amp;I industry practices, optimize all of the data that mobile operators are holding on to, and ensure that appropriate technical, legal, and ethical exchange mechanisms are in place to ensure responsible use of PD&amp;I. 
 Idea Three: Standardize a connected individual identity scoring scheme, i.e., a scheme for identity and transaction verification, often centralized around mobile data. This scheme is analogous to credit scoring for lending and fraud detection for credit card purchases. It would help enterprises simultaneously better serve their customers, protect PD&amp;I, mitigate fraud, and improve their regulatory compliance efforts. 
 
<p>According to Virginie, a commercial imperative for an enterprise is knowing their customer–verifying the customer’s identity prior to and during engagements. Knowing the customer helps enterprises not only better serve the customer, but also manage costs, reduce waste, mitigate fraud, and stay on the right side of the law and regulations. Virginie remarked that her customers often say, “I want to know who is my end user. Who am I talking to? Am I speaking to the right person in front of me?” This is hard enough in the physical realm, and in the digital realm it is even more difficult. The ideas discussed in this interview can help enterprises answer these questions.</p>
 Consumer Identity and the Enterprise 
<p>The mobile phone has become a cornerstone for digital identity management and commerce. In fact, Cameron D’Ambrosi, Managing Director of Liminal, has gone as far as to suggest <a>mobile has an irreplaceable role in the digital identity ecosystem</a>.<a>1</a> Mobile can help enterprises be certain whom they are dealing with, and with this certainty help them, with confidence, successfully connect, communicate, and engage people in nearly any transactions.</p>
<p>To successfully leverage mobile as a tool for customer identity management, which is an enabler of what is known as “know your customer” or KYC, enterprises work with organizations like GMS to integrate mobile identity verification into their commercial workflow. In our interview, Virginie notes that GMS is a global messaging aggregator, the “man in the middle.” It provides messaging and related services powered by personal data and identity to enterprises and mobile operators, including KYC services.</p>
 Benefits gained from knowing your customer 
<p>There is a wide range of use cases for why an enterprise may want to use services provided by players like GMS. They can:</p>
 
 Improve customer experience: Knowing the customer and the context of a transaction can help improve the customer experience. 
 Maintain data hygiene: Ensuring data in a CRM or customer system of record that is accurate can improve marketing, save money, reduce fraud, and more. 
 Effectively manage data: Reducing duplicate records, tagging data, and more can reduce costs, create efficiency, and generate new business opportunities (side note: <a>poor data management costs enterprises billions annually</a>).<a>2</a> 
 Ensure regulatory compliance: Industry and government best practices, legislation, and regulation is not just nice to have; it is a business requirement. Staying compliant can mitigate risk, build trust, and help organizations differentiate themselves in the market. 
 Mitigate cybercrime: Cybercrime is costing industry trillions of dollars a year (<a>Morgan (2020) predicts the tally could be as much as $10.5 trillion annually by 2025</a>).<a>3</a>These losses can be reduced with an effective strategy. 
 
 The connected individual identity scoring scheme 
<p>When a consumer signs up for or buys a product or service, an enterprise may prompt them to provide a mobile number and other personal data as part of the maintenance of their profile and to support the transaction. An enterprise working with GSM, in real-time, can ping GMS’s network to verify if the consumer-provided mobile number is real, i.e., operational. Moreover, they can ask GMS to predict, with varying levels of accuracy, if a mobile number and PD&amp;I being used in a transaction is associated with a real person. They can also ask if the presumed person conducting the transaction can be trusted or if they might be a fraudster looking to cheat the business. This is a decision based on relevant personal information provided by the individual prior to or during the transaction, as well as data drawn from other sources.</p>
<p>This type of real-time identity and trust verification is made possible by a process Virginie refers to as “scoring.” I refer to it as “the connected individual identity scoring scheme.” Scoring is an intricate and complex choreography of data management and analysis, executed by GMS in milliseconds. This dance consists of pulling together and analyzing a myriad of personal data, deterministic and probabilistic identifiers, and mobile phone signals. The actors in this dance include GMS, the enterprise, the consumer, and GMS’s strategic network of mobile network operators and PD&amp;I aggregator partners.</p>
<p>When asked by an enterprise to produce a score, GMS, in real-time, combines and analyzes enterprise-provided data (e.g., customer name, addresses, phone number, presumed location, etc.), mobile operator signal data (e.g., the actual location of a phone, SIM card, and number forwarding status), and PD&amp;I aggregator supplied data. From this information, it produces a score. This score is used to determine the likelihood a transaction being initiated by “someone” is legitimate and can be trusted, or not. A perfect score of 1 would suggest that, with one hundred percent certainty, the person is who they say they are and can be trusted, and a score of zero would suggest they are most certainly a cybercriminal.</p>
<p>In our interview, Virginie notes, “nothing is perfect, we need to admit that,” thus suggesting that one should never expect a perfect score. The more certain a business wants to be, i.e.&nbsp;the higher score they require to confirm a transaction, the more the business should expect the possibility of increased transactional costs, time, and friction in the user experience. Keeping this in mind, businesses should develop a risk tolerance matrix, based on the context of a transaction, to determine if they want to accept the current transaction or not. For example, for lower risk or lower cost transactions (e.g., an online pizza order) the business might have a lower assurance tolerance and will accept a lower score. For higher-risk or higher-cost transactions (e.g., a bank wire transfer), they might need a higher assurance tolerance and accept only higher scores.</p>
 Example: Detecting fraud in a banking experience 
<p>Virginie used a bank transaction as an example. She explained that a bank could check if a customer’s mobile phone is near the expected location of a transaction. If it was not, this might suggest there is a possibility of fraud occurring, which would negatively impact the score.</p>
<p>Mobile scoring happens every day, but not always by this name–others refer to it as mobile signaling or mobile device intelligence. However, Virginie alluded to a challenge. There is no industry standard for scoring, which may lead to inconsistencies in execution and bias across the industry. She suggested that more industry collaboration is needed to prevent this.</p>
 The Trust Chain 
<p>During our conversation, Virginie proposed a novel idea which frames what we in the industry could do to optimize the PD&amp;I value and use it responsibly. Virginie said we need to build a chain of trust amongst the PD&amp;I actors, “The Trust Chain”.</p>
<p>I have taken poetic license, based on our conversation, and have illustrated The Trust Chain in the figure below. The figure depicts connected individuals* at the center, resting on a bed of industry players linked to enterprises. A yellow band circles them all to illustrate the flow of personal data and identity throughout the chain.</p>
<p></p>
 
 Defining the connected individual and being phygital: It is so easy in business to get distracted by our labels. It is important to remember the terms we use to refer to the people we serve—prospect, consumer, patient, shopper, investor, user, etc.—are contrived and can distract. These terms are all referring to the same thing: a human, an individual, and more importantly, a contextual state or action at some point along the customer journey, i.e., sometimes I am a shopper considering a product, other times I am a consumer using the product. The shopper and the consumer are not always the same person. Understanding this is important to ensure effective engagement in the connected age. In the context of today’s world and this discussion, the individual is connected. They are connected with phones, tablets, smartwatches, cars, and more. These connections have made us “phygital” beings, merging the digital and physical self. Each and every one of these connections is producing data. 
 
<p>According to Virginie, the key to making the industry more effective and efficient is to tap into more and more of the connected individual data held and managed by mobile network operators. This is because, in her own words, “they know everything.” To tap into this data, Virginie said a number of technical, legal, and ethical complexities must be overcome. In addition, an improved model for data exchange amongst the primary actors of the industry—mobile network operators, enterprises, messaging aggregators (like GMS), and PD&amp;I aggregators—needs to be established. In other words, “The Trust Chain” needs to be refined and built. The presumption behind all of this is that the current models of data exchange can be found wanting.</p>
 What we need to do next 
<p>In summary, the conclusion I draw from my interview with Virginie are that we should come together to tackle:</p>
 
 The technical, legal, and ethical complexities to enable more effective access to the treasure trove of data held by the mobile network operators 
 The standardization of a connected individual scoring scheme 
 The development and integrity for “The Trust Chain” 
 
<p>My takeaway from our discussion is simple, I agree with her ideas. These efforts and more are needed. The use of personal data and identity throughout the industry is accelerating at an exponential rate. To ensure all parties can safely engage, transact, and thrive, it is critical that industry leaders develop a sustainable and responsible, marketplace.</p>

<p>Prelude: First off, if you haven’t already read <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~fms27/papers/2012-BonneauHerOorSta-password--oakland.pdf">The Quest to Replace the Password</a> stop reading this and give that a read first. To paraphrase my computer security professor, If you haven’t read this paper before you design an authentication system you’re probably just reinventing something already created or missing a piece of the puzzle. So go ahead take a read of that paper first before you continue on. In fact, I just re-read this paper before I started working on it because it does an excellent job of framing the problem.</p>

 

<p>Over the past few years, I’ve spent a fair amount of time thinking about what the next generation of authentication and authorization systems will look like from a variety of different perspectives. I started out looking at the problem from a user’s perspective originally just looking to get rid of passwords. Then I looked at it as an attacker working as an intern penetration tester which gave me a unique eye into understanding the attacker mindset. Unfortunately, I didn’t find myself enjoying the red team side of security too much (combined with having a 2-year non-compete as an intern - that was a joke in hindsight) so by happenstance, I found myself into the standards community where the next generation of authentication (AuthN) and authorization (AuthZ) systems have been being built. Combine this with the view of a software engineer attempting to build the standards that are being written by some world-class experts with centuries of combined experience. Throughout this experience, I’ve gotten to view the state of the art while also getting to keep the naiveness that comes with being a fairly new engineer relative to some of the experts I get to work with. During this time I’ve become a bit more opinionated on what makes a good authentication system and this time around I’m going to jot down my current thoughts on what makes something useful.</p>

<p>However, one aspect that I think that paper lacks is that it frames the problem of authentication on the web as something where the next goal is to move to something different other than passwords, but we just haven’t found that better thing yet. While I think this is probably true for some aspects of low-security systems I think that fundamentally passwords or more generally, “Things I know” are here to stay. The problem is that we haven’t done a good enough job of understanding the requirements that the user needs to intuitively use the system as well as making sure that the system sufficiently gets out of the way of the user. As the paper does point out though, this is likely due to our specialization bias which doesn’t allow us to take into considerations the holistic view points necessary to approach the problem. What I’m proposing I think is a way in which we can jump this hurdle through the usage of hard data. Read on and let me know if you think this can solve this issue or if I’m just full of my own implicit biases.</p>

<p>So what’re the important insights that I’ve been thinking about lately? First off, the user experience of authenticating on the web has to be joyful first and foremost. If the user doesn’t have a better experience than what they do with passwords, which is a very low bar to beat when considering all the passwords they have to remember, then it’s simply unacceptable and won’t achieve the uptake that’s needed to overtake passwords.</p>

<p>Secondly, I think it’s important that we recognize that the security of any authentication system is probabilistic, not deterministic. By reframing the problem to understand that with each additional security check we do under the classifications of “what I know”, “what I am”, and “what I have” it allows us to better understand the problem we’re actually trying to solve with security. To put this idea in perspective think about the problem this way. What’s the probability that a security system will be broken for any particular user during a particular period? For example, a user who chooses to reuse their password that’s set to “#1password” for every website is a lot less likely (my intuition - happy to be proven wrong) than a user who can memorize a password like “p2D16U$nClNjqLseKTtnjw” for every website. However, there’s a significant tradeoff on the user’s experience which is why the case where a user reuses an easy to remember is a lot more likely to occur when studying users than the latter case even though we know it’s less secure.</p>

<p>So what gives? This all sounds obvious to a semi-well thought-out engineer, right? The difference is we simply don’t know the probability of a security system failing in an ideal scenario over a pre-determined period. To put this in perspective - can anyone point me to an academic research paper or even some user research that tells me the probability that a user’s password will be discovered by an attacker in the next year? What about the probability that the user shares their password with a trusted person because the system wasn’t deployed with a delegation system? Or how about how the probability will drop as the user reuses their password across many websites? Simply put I think we’ve been asking the wrong question here and until we can have hard data on this we can’t make rigorous choices on the acceptable UX/security tradeoffs that are so hard to decide today.</p>

<p>This isn’t relevant for just passwords either, this extends to many different forms of authentication that fall under the other two authentication classes as well. For example, what’s the probability that a user’s account will be breached when relying on the Open ID Connect protocol rather than a password? Furthermore, what’s the likelihood that the user prefers the Open ID Connect system rather than a password for each website, and is that likelihood worth the increase or decrease in probabilistic security under one or many attack vectors?</p>

<p>The best part of this framing is that it changes how we look at security on the web from the user’s perspective, but that’s not the only part that has to be considered as is rightly pointed in the paper. There’s a very important third factor that has to be considered as well which is deployability, which I like to reframe as “developer experience” or DevX.</p>

<p>By evaluating a constraint of a system in this way we reframe the problem into a measurable outcome that becomes far more tractable and measurable between the variety of constraints that need to be considered including the developer deploying or maintaining the system, the user who’s using it, and the resistance to common threats (Don’t worry about unrealistic threat models for now - mature them over time) which the user expects the designers of the system to protect them from.</p>

<p>Once we’ve got that data let’s sit down and re-evaluate what are the most important principles of designing the system. I’ll make a few predictions to wrap this up as well.</p>

<p>First prediction: I think once we have this data we’ll see a few different things which will be obvious in hindsight. A system that doesn’t prioritize UX over DevX over probabilistic security resilience will be dead in the water since it goes against the “user should enjoy the authentication experience principle”. Additionally, DevX has to come before security because without a good devX it’s less likely to be implemented at all let alone properly.</p>

<p>Second prediction: I’d venture to guess that we’ll learn a few things about the way we frame security on the web with the clear winner being that we should be designing for MFA systems by default, but “what I have” categories need to be the basis of the majority of experiences for the user with the “what I know” categories being an escalated approach with “what I am” categories only being needed in the highest assurance use cases or at the time of more red flags having been raised (e.g. new IP address, new device, etc) and being enforced on-device rather than handled by a remote server.</p>

<p>Final prediction: Recovery is going to be the hardest part of the system to figure out with multi-device flows being only slightly easier to solve. I wouldn’t be surprised if the solution to recovery was actually to not recover and instead make it super easy to “burn and recreate” (as John Jordan has advocated in the decentralized identity community) an account on the web because that’s how hard recovery actually is to get right.</p>

<p>So that’s what I’ve got for now. I’m sure I’m missing something here and I’m sure I’m wrong in a few other cases. Share your comments on this down below or feel free to send me an email and tell me I’m wrong. I do appreciate the thoughtfulness that others put into pointing these things out so let me know what you think and let’s discuss it further. Thanks for reading!</p>

    We spend most of our waking hours being held to account between the guardrails of risk-informed and responsible decision making.&nbsp; Undoubtedly, we often climb over the guardrails and make ill-informed, irresponsible and irrational decisions, but that is human agency. It is also true that we would not innovate, create or discover if we could not explore the other side of our safety guardrails.&nbsp; <p>Today’s perception of responsible decision making is different to that our grandparents held.&nbsp; Our grandchildren will look back at our “risk-informed” decisions with the advantage of hindsight and question why our risk management frameworks were so short-term-focused.&nbsp; However, we need to recognise that our guardrails are established by current political, economic and societal framing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>What are we optimising for?”</p><p>I often ask the question, “what are we optimising for?” The reason I ask this question is to draw out different viewpoints in a leadership team.&nbsp; The viewpoints that drive individual optimisation is framed by their experience, ability to understand time-frames and incentives.&nbsp;</p><p>Peak Paradox is a non-confrontational framework to explore our different perceptions of what we are optimising for.&nbsp; We need different and diverse views to ensure that our guardrails don’t become so narrow they look like rail tracks, and we repeat the same mistakes because that is what the process determines.&nbsp; Equally, we must agree together boundaries of divergence which means we can optimise as a team for something that we believe in and has a shared purpose of us and our stakeholders.&nbsp; Finding this dynamic area of alignment is made easier with the Peak Paradox framework.&nbsp;</p><p>However, our model of risk-informed responsible decision making is based on the idea that the majority decides, essentially democracy.&nbsp; If the “majority” is a supermajority, we need 76%; for a simple majority, we need 51%, and for minority protections less than 10%.&nbsp; What we get depends on how someone has previously set up the checks, balances, and control system. And then there is the idea of monarchy or the rich and powerful making the decisions for everyone else, the 0.001%.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>However, our guardrails for democratic decision making breaks down when there is a need for choices, decisions, judgement that has to be made that people do not like.&nbsp; How do we enable better decisions when hard decisions mean you will lose the support of the majority?&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>We do not all agree with vaccines (even before covid), eating meat, climate change, our government or authority.&nbsp; Vaccines in the current global pandemic period are one such tension of divergence.&nbsp; We see this every day in the news feeds; there is an equal and opposite view for every side.&nbsp; Humanity at large lives at Peak Paradox, but we don’t equally value everyone views. Why do we struggle with the idea that individual liberty of choice can be taken away in the interests of everyone?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Climate change is another.&nbsp; Should the government act in the longer term and protect the future or act in the short term persevering liberty and ensure re-election?&nbsp; Protestors with a cause may fight authority and are portrayed as mavericks and disruptors, but history remembers many as pioneers, martyrs and great leaders.&nbsp; Those who protested in the 1960 and 1970s against nuclear energy may look back today and think that they should have been fighting fossil fuels.&nbsp; Such pioneers are optimising for something outside of the normal guardrails. Whilst they appear to be living outside of the accepted guardrails, they can see they should be adopted.</p><p>Our guardrails work well when we can agree on the consequences of risk-informed and responsible decision making; however, in an age when information is untrusted and who is responsible is questioned, we find that we all have different guardrails.&nbsp; Living at Peak Paradox means we have to accept we will never agree on what is a responsible decision and we are likely to see that our iteration of democracy that maintains power and control is going to end in a revolution if we could only agree on what to optimise for.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>

    Are the consequence of a ½ baked decision that we created (the mess we are in)squared <br><p>This article joins how the #climate outcomes we get may be related to the evidence requirements we set.&nbsp; The audience for this viewpoint is those who are thinking about the long term consequences of our current decisions and the evidence we use to support those decisions. We are hoping to bring a sense of clarity to our community on why we feel frustrated and lost. You should read this because it will make you think and it will raise questions we need to debate over coffee as we search to become better versions of ourselves.&nbsp;</p><p>@yaelrozencwajg @yangbo @tonyfish </p><p>The running order is: Which camp are you in for positioning of the crisis: know and accepted, still questioning or denial. &nbsp; What are the early approaches to solutions?&nbsp; What are policymakers doing and what is their perspective.&nbsp; The action is to accept the invitation to debate at the end.</p><br><p>Part 1. Sustainability set up</p><p>The world appears more opinionated and divided about everything.&nbsp; Climate change: real or not.&nbsp; Vaccination for COVID19 conspiracy and control or in the public best interest.&nbsp; Space travel for billionaires or feeding those in need. Universal basic income policy vs ignoring those aspects of society we find uncomfortable. Equality creates a more fair society or leaves us alone. So many votes are for self-interest, “it is fairer to me.”&nbsp; Transparency will hold those in power to account or it will only make or worse. Open networks might create new business models on the web, but will they be sustainable? Sustainability is a false claim or it is our only option. Like books, and publications it is now complexity that is the tool that ensures power remains with the few.</p><p>We need to unpack the conflictual and tension-filled gaps in our beliefs, opinions and judgment because we depend on evidence to change our views. How evidence is presented and the systematic squeezing out of curiosity frames us and our current views.&nbsp;</p><p>Evidence, in this context, is actually a problem as we have a very divided idea of what evidence is.&nbsp; For some, evidence is a social media post from an influencer with 10 million followers (how can everyone else be wrong).&nbsp; For others a headline on the front of a tabloid newspaper is truth (is it printed.)&nbsp; For others, a statistical peer-reviewed leading journal publication that is cited 100 times is evidence.&nbsp; In terms of evidence for decision making, there is a gap between the evidence requirements for research and the evidence requirements for business decisions.&nbsp; To be clear, it is not that either is better; it is how we frame evidence that matters. The danger is being framed to believe something because there is a mismatch in the evidence requirements for a decision.&nbsp; A single 100% influencer claim without statistical proof say about “fertility” vs a statistical trial with probability highlights both how a claim is only a claim but many will not understand what evidence is.</p><p>Why is this important? Because the evidence we see in journals, TV, media, books and publications have different criteria and credentials to those that inform business decisions.&nbsp; Where is the environmental action being decided; in the board rooms!&nbsp; Is this gap in evidence leading to a sustainability gap?</p><p></p><br><p>Part 2. Analysis from Kahan&nbsp;</p><p>Here is the rub, it turns out that how scientific evidence is presented matters as its very presentation creates division.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://law.yale.edu/dan-m-kahan">Dan Kahan</a>, a Yale behavioural economist, has spent the last decade studying whether the use of reason aggravates or reduces “partisan” beliefs. His research papers are <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=45442">here</a>. His research shows that aggravation and alienation easily win, irrespective of being more liberal or conservative. The more we use our faculties for scientific thought, the more likely we will take a strong position that aligns with our (original) political group (or thought).</p><p>A way through this could be to copy “<a href="https://www.solutionsjournalism.org/">solution journalism</a>”, which reports on ways people and governments meaningfully respond to difficult problems and not on what the data says the problem is. Rather than use our best insights, analysis and thinking to reach the version of the “truth”, we use data to find ways to agree with others opinions in our communities. We help everyone to become curious. Tony Fish has created the <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/">Peak Paradox framework</a> as an approach to remaining curious by identifying where we are aligned and where there is a delta in views without conflict.</p><p>When we use data and science in our arguments and explain the problem, the individuals will selectively credit and discredit information in patterns that reflect their commitment to certain values. They (we) (I) assimilate what they (we)(I) want.</p><p>Kahan, in 2014, asked over <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2459057">1,500 respondents</a> whether they agreed or disagreed with the following statement: “There is solid evidence of recent global warming due mostly to human activity such as burning fossil fuels.” They collected information on individuals' political beliefs and rated their science intelligence.” The analysis found that those with the least science intelligence actually have less partisan positions than those with the most. A Conservative with strong science intelligence will use their skills to find evidence against human-caused global warming, while a Liberal will find evidence for it (cognitive bias.)</p><p></p><p>In the chart above, the y-axis represents the probability of a person agreeing that human activity caused climate change. The x-axis represents the percentile a person scored on the scientific knowledge test. The width of the bars shows the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval">confidence interval</a> for that probability.</p><br><p>Part 3. Are our policies being formed by the evidence we like or evidence we have?</p><p>Governments, activists, and the media have gotten better at holding corporations accountable for the societal repercussions of their actions. A plethora of groups score businesses based on their ESG&nbsp; performance, and despite often dubious methodology, these rankings are gathering a lot of attention. As a result, ESG has emerged as an unavoidable concern for corporate executives worldwide. ESG should be for boards for “purpose” or “are we doing the right thing” camp, but instead has ended up in the compliance camp, do the min, tick box.</p><p>For decades businesses have addressed sustainability as an end of pipe problem or afterthought. Rather than fundamentally altering their models to recognise that sustainability and wellbeing are critical parts for long term success, boards have typically delegated social issues to corporate social responsibility, compliance policies, or charitable foundations and associations, thus they publish their findings (which is not evidence) in annual reports. The issue becomes that neither investors nor stakeholders read these sustainability reports. Actually, they shouldn’t either.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Although investors' thinking on sustainability has evolved substantially over the past few decades, sustainability and efficiency leaders have used strategies to pressure corporations to advance a wide range of social concerns such as the SDGs across industries and supply chains, regardless of the financial considerations. As ESG assessments, sustainability reports or guidelines have become more rigorous; this accountability raises essential biases. This “pressure” has resulted in many types of actions and raised many concerns, including in the operational efficiencies supposed to reduce the use of energy and natural resources at the expense of their profitability.</p><p>Whilst it is still unclear if most investors utilise ESGs factors in their investment selection process based on evidence, it is clear that we do side with what we want to hear and not with the science, <a href="https://law.yale.edu/dan-m-kahan">Dan Kahan</a>, in part 2 above, was right.</p><br><p>Part 4. Null Hypothesis H(0) A lack of headspace for most people to think about the complexity of these issues due to meeting performance targets means leadership has to make time. And if it does not, we become the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>At what point do people care about something bigger than themselves? This means you as a person have the headspace to move from survival towards thriving. (PeakParadox.com)</p><p>If ⅓ of the world don’t know where the next meal today comes from, they will not have the headspace to worry about sustainability.</p><p>If the next additional ⅓ of the world don’t know where the food will come from for tomorrow, they will not have the headspace to worry about sustainability.</p><p>If the next ⅙ of the world will run out of food and money in 4 weeks - worrying about sustainability is not their most significant concern.</p><p>Less than ⅙ of the world can survive and think beyond four weeks - is that enough to make a difference, and are these people in roles that count?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Between than 0.01% and 0.001%&nbsp; (8m and 80m) people should be able to consider global complexity on the basis that they will never have money or food issues (over $1m in assets), but are they acting together and is their voice enough to make a difference?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Is leadership's first priority to ensure that first ⅚ have enough to survive and worry for them, but are they able to manage this conflict?&nbsp; Which group has the headspace to cope with recycling?&nbsp; What is amazing and worthy of note is that the majority of those who care about the environment, sustainability, recycling have created headspace irrespective of their situation. The argument above was designed to frame your thinking, the reality is we don’t create headspace because we are too busy.</p><p>Part 5.&nbsp; The imposter syndrome: followers are not followers</p><p>Politics (leadership), Business (leadership), Quango/ NGO (leadership), individuals (leadership), influencers (leadership) - all have different agendas, and demands for different outcomes as incentives drive in different directions. &nbsp; We lack sustainable leadership that drives in one direction.&nbsp;</p><p>As a Leader and opinion former, the most troubling finding should be that individuals with more “scientific intelligence” are the quickest to align themselves on subjects they don’t know anything about. In one experiment, Kahan analysed how people’s opinions on an unfamiliar subject are affected when given some basic scientific information, along with details about what people in their self-identified political group tend to believe about that subject. It turned out that those with the strongest scientific reasoning skills were most likely to use the information to develop partisan opinions.</p><p>Critically Kahan’s research shows that people that score well on a measure called “scientific curiosity” actually show less partisanship, and it is this aspect we need to use.</p><p>Do we need to move away from “truth”, “facts”, “data”, and “right decisions” if we want to have a board and senior team who can become aligned? We need to present ideas, concepts, how others are finding solutions and make our teams more curious. Being curious appears to be the best way to bring us together — however counterintuitive that is.&nbsp; But to do that, we have to give up on filling time, productivity, efficiency, effectiveness, keeping people busy and giving more people time to escape survival and work together for the better good.&nbsp;</p><p>There is a systematic squeezing out of curiosity in our current system.&nbsp; Are we to blame through schooling and education, and search engines? Have we lost how to be curious if the fact and truth presented to us is one that just aligns to our natural bias or one that challenges us? &nbsp; Do we spend sufficient time with others' views to be able to improve our own?&nbsp; Has individualism and personalisation created and reinforced our self opinions of our own views are correct?&nbsp; Does the advertising model depend on this divide?<br><br></p><p>Part 6. Conclusion, rationality and irrationality&nbsp; <br><br></p><p>There is a clear message to those in leadership; stop using evidence to create division, push people away or sure up your own camp. How do we take (all) evidence in and use it to ask questions which mean we come together for a common purpose?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Politics becomes irrational as we focus more on the individual and less on society and community. Politicians and policy formation need to be voted in, which means they have to mislead and misrepresent their populations who are acting in their own interests: therefore, we find evidence for decisions for short term gain based on individual preferences and not long term community - this is obvious but has to be said.&nbsp; The same is happening in many corporations.</p><p>Anger is often seen as a rational emotion, but that is because we focus on the evidence we want to justify the action. When you feel under-represented, threatened, or in harm's way - the evidence you want will fit the glove. Understanding how the evidence frames us is what brings value to the process.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Part 7. Call to action: The Road to Sustainability webinar series</p><p>We believe we have to communicate better, talk openly, listen to more, debate to appreciate, be curious and find a route to collaborate. The best way is to do something small.&nbsp; Sign up for the sessions below and bring your evidence, but be prepared to take away different evidence so we can make better decisions together.&nbsp;</p><p>The Road to Sustainability is a content and tool platform and initiative launched in October 2020 that started as a weekly email newsletter providing approaches and strategies to plan sustainability and innovation. We are launching the third edition of our webinar series, following up on the successful two previous versions, “From chaos to recovery: gateway to sustainability”.<br><br>This new series will take place every Monday through 5 meetings from October 4th to November 8th, with a possible extension of the plan.<br><br>The following schedule is based on our approach "<a href="https://event.theroadtosustainability.com.">Roadmap and product management - the new framework for sustainability conversations</a>". The sessions have an informative purpose and constitute sets of criteria to help organisations in their operations towards sustainability:</p><p>Please register here: <a href="https://event.theroadtosustainability.com">https://event.theroadtosustainability.com</a>.</p> <br>

<blockquote>"It was hard to write, it should be hard to use" </blockquote><p>The quote above was something a programmer friend of mine used to say in the '90s and, despite all the advances in user experience or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience_design">UX design</a>, it appears to remain effectively true. Let's look at the experience over this past weekend with the newly rolled out <a href="https://covid-19.ontario.ca/proof-covid-19-vaccination">enhanced vaccine certificate</a> in Ontario.</p><p>Let me preface this by saying that I appreciate that this may be version 1 of a certificate with a QR code and that my comments are intended for an improved version 1.x or 2 of the proof of vaccination. I should also note that CBC has already pointed out that <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/vaccine-certificate-accessibility-1.6213934">Ontario's enhanced vaccine certificate system is not accessible to marginalized people</a>.</p> Downloading the Certificate <p>You will need to go to <a href="https://covid-19.ontario.ca/get-proof/">https://covid-19.ontario.ca/get-proof/</a> and answer the following questions:</p>  How many doses of the COVID-19 vaccine do you currently have? (required)   Did you get all your doses in Ontario? (required)  Select which health card you have (required)  Do you identify as First Nations, Inuit, or Métis? (required) If you are a non-Indigenous partner or household member of someone in this group, select "Yes."  A couple of more clicks (get the certificate through the website or get it by mail or print it at a local library, ServiceOntario location, or call a friend and you will be asked to agree to the <a href="https://covid19.ontariohealth.ca/app-terms">Terms of Service</a> which includes the following:  <blockquote>By inputting your personal information and personal health information into the COVID-19 Vaccination Services you are agreeing to the ministry's collection, use and disclosure of this information for the purpose of researching, investigating, eliminating or reducing the current COVID-19 outbreak and as permitted or required by law in accordance with PHIPA as set out above. You also agree that your information will be made available to the Public Health Unit(s) in Ontario responsible for your geographic area for the same purpose.</blockquote><blockquote>More specifically, by using COVID-19 Vaccination Services, you consent to the ministry collecting identifying information, including personal health information, about you that you submit through the patient verification page so that the Ministry can ensure that it correctly identifies you for the purpose of administering the COVID-19 vaccination program.</blockquote><blockquote>Neither the ministry nor the Public Health Unit(s) in Ontario will further use or disclose your personal information or personal health information except for the purposes set out above.</blockquote><p>When you click on the "Get a copy" button you may be asked to wait because a virtual queue is being used to throttle traffic. When you get through you will be asked to provide information from your health card. I have a green OHIP card with a photo so I get this screen:</p><p>Assuming the information is correct you will be shown your new certificate, including a QR code (more on this later) as a PDF. At this point, it is on you to print out copies of the two-page certificate and carry them with you. I took it upon myself to crop the certificate to include just my name, birth date &amp; the QR code and print it out small enough that I could put it in a laminating pouch and carry it in my wallet. This enables me to go to my wallet, pull out the laminate and my driving license, and have both ready for presentation. For me, that is the simplest and easiest way. Your mileage may vary since my approach requires being comfortable with basic pdf or graphic editing and having access to a printer. I also put electronic copies on my phone so that I could use that option </p> Verifying the certificate <p>Here is what I observed at brunch (shout out to the <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Restaurant_Review-g155019-d796688-Reviews-Sunset_Grill-Toronto_Ontario.html">Sunset Grill on the Danforth</a>).</p>  Staff person asks for Proof of Vaccine  Customer digs out their phone or paper copy of the certificate  The staff person looks at it (or uses the Ontario Verify App)  Staff person asks for a government-issued ID  Customer digs out their driver's license  The staff person looks at the ID and verifies the name   We can do better <p>What I oberved is NOT a user-friendly experience for either the customer or the business. For the experience to be improved it needs to be a single presentation operation of either a paper or digital certificate that the business can verify in one step. Here's an example that I mocked up some months ago (the picture is from <a href="https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/">https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/</a>)</p><p>This provides the following functionality:</p>  The existing QR code will return the same (i.e. green checkmark in the event of a good code)  The verifier (staff person) can compare the photo on the card with the person in front of them rather than asking for a government ID.  Digital verification may have the option of showing the verifier the picture on the verify app for increased assurance. Note that the Ministry of Health is already authorized to have pictures for the current health card.   Privacy and Security <p>The advantage of a paper and ID card presentation ritual is that it is difficult to hack. So if we are going to improve the presentation with a single credential as above, privacy and security MUST be protected. This is why a version 1 that is paper/PDF only is not a bad security and privacy choice. On the <a href="https://covid-19.ontario.ca/verify">Verify Ontario </a>app side, both the <a href="https://covid-19.ontario.ca/verify-terms-of-use">terms of use</a> and <a href="https://covid-19.ontario.ca/verify-privacy">privacy statement</a> are reasonably clear (although the choice to use Google Analytics could be questioned) and make the right commitments &nbsp;</p> Recommendations  Provide retailers with a verifier <p>It's nice that the Ontario Verify app is freely downloadable. I used it to check that the laminated cards that I made from my own certificate were readable. But this puts the burden on the retailer and their staff. When I saw someone come in with their QR code, the waitress had to dig out her personal phone and use that. Not a good solution. Either the provincial government or public health should provide retailers with a low to zero cost option to procure their own tablets for use on entry to the store.</p> Provide Ontarians with options <p>For example:</p>  I'm relatively tech-savvy so I'd be happy with a QR code/certificate I could add to a wallet app on my phone for easy display without fumbling around.  ServiceOntario should provide a service to produce laminated wallet cards WITH photos to any Ontarian who shows up at a ServiceOntario site.  On a go-forward basis, ensure that people attending vaccination clinics get printouts of their QR code based certificates WHEN they get vaccinated since the certificate includes the date of vaccination and presumably the QR code won't return a "Green" until the appropriate dated  <p>With all of the above said, I have to say I'm happy that Ontario's first steps for vaccine certificates appear to have respected Ontarians' privacy and look to be built securely. I look forward to the next couple of weeks because I'm sure that security people will be pounding on the service to find flaws. WHEN they find flaws, let's hope that the province is responsive so that we can all benefit. &nbsp;</p>

  <br>For the past 50 years, most business leaders in free market-based economies have been taught or trained in a core ideology; "that the purpose of business is to serve only the shareholder". The source was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Friedman">#MiltonFriedman</a>. Whilst shareholder primacy is simple and allows businesses to optimise for one thing, which has an advantage in terms of decision making, it has also created significant damage. It does not stand up to modern critique and challenges such as ESG. Importantly there is an assumption that a shareholder group was a united and unified collective. <br> There is an assumption: shareholders are united and unified  <br>The reality is that in a public or investor-led company, the shareholders are as diverse in terms of vision, rationale, purpose and expectation as any standard group of associated parties. Shareholders as a group rarely have an entirely homogeneous objective. Given the dominance of shareholder primacy, how do we know this concept of non-homogeneous actors is genuine. Because there are conflicts among shareholders, which is so large, it constitutes a topic of high practical relevance for academic interest. Two areas dominate research in this area, board performance and board dynamics. Particular attention has been given to conflict that arises when ownership is shared between a dominant, controlling shareholder and minority shareholders. <br><br><br><br><br>The majority and dominant shareholders have incentives to pursue personal goals through the business as they disproportionately gain the benefits but do not fully bear the economic risks and can misuse their power to exploit minority shareholders. That is, the majority shareholder may push management and the board to pursue objectives that align with their own priorities but that are detrimental for the minority shareholder. Studies have shown that such conflicts negatively affect a firm's performance, valuation, and innovation. In listed companies, market regulators, using minority protection clauses, try to avoid this abuse of power, but in private equity markets, there is no regulator to prevent this conflict.<br><br>Surprisingly, however, far less research has examined whether and how different types of shareholders (even stakeholders) can complement each other so that mutual benefits arise. <br><br>In a recent study examining shareholder relationships in privately held firms, the outcomes of private equity investments in privately held family businesses were compared. This research hypothesis was to test if the objectives of professional investors and family owners differ. PE investors focus on maximising financial returns through a medium-term exit and generally have lower levels of risk aversion. Family shareholders, in contrast, generally have most of their wealth concentrated in a single firm, hold longer time horizons, and are often particularly concerned about non-economic benefits the firm brings to the family (e.g., reputation in the community). What is clear is that the reason to trade and have a purpose is critical for any alignment to emerge. <br><br>We know that boards and management need to be informed and review shareholders' objectives. Shareholders need to be informed and review the extent to which they are still aligned in terms of time horizons, risk preferences, need for cash, prioritising financial goals, and whether control or dominance of an agenda is constructive or destructive. Which is the segway to the Peak Paradox mapping above. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>The fundamental issue is that we <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/post/plotting-how-to-make-better-decisions">cannot make decisions at Peak Paradox</a> and have to move towards a Peak to determine what we are optimising for. For shareholders who optimise for Peak Individual Purpose will want to use a dominant position or minority protection to force an agenda to their own goals. A high performing board, perceived, will optimise towards Peak Work Purpose. This included commercial and noncommercial, where commercial boards will optimise for a single objective such as shareholder primacy. What becomes evident at this point is the question about diversity. Dominant shareholders can create environments where the lack of diversity or thinking, experience, motivation, purpose and incentives serves them and their objectives. This will also be seen as a board that does not ask questions, cannot deal with conflict and avoids tension. Finally, if we move towards optimising for a better society (Peak Social Purpose), we find that we move towards serving stakeholders. <br><br> Will society be better off because this business exists? <br>The critical point here is that stakeholders cannot live with Peak Paradox's decision-making and have to find something to optimise for and align to. This will not be a three or five-year plan but a reason for the business to exist. At Peak Paradox, the most important questions get asked, such as "Will society be better off because this business exists?" Because the same data should present a yes and no answer, and the board needs to justify why it believes it should.

  <p>Today’s <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/projectvrm/Main_Page">Project VRM</a> meeting marks
the project’s 15 years anniversary. A good opportunity to list the uses cases that have
emerged over the years. To make them more manageable, I categorize them by the stage of
the relationship between customer and vendor:</p>
 Category 1: Establishing the relationship 
<p>What happens when a Customer or a Vendor wishes to initiate a relationship, or wishes to modify the
terms of the relationship.</p>
 1.1 Customer initiates a new relationship with a Vendor 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to offer initiating a new relationship with a Vendor.”</p>
<p>Description:</p>
 
 The Customer encounters the Vendor’s electronic presence (e.g. their website) 
 The Customer performs a gesture on the Vendor’s site that indicates their interest of establishing
a relationship 
 As part of the gesture, the Customer’s proposed terms are conveyed to the Vendor 
 In response, the Vendor provides acceptance of the proposed relationship and offered terms,
or offers alternate terms in return. 
 If the offered terms are different from the proposed terms, the Customer has the opportunity
to propose alternate terms; this continues until both parties agree on the terms or
abort the initiation. 
 Once the terms have been agreed on, both sides record their agreement. 
 
<p>Notes:</p>
 
 To make this “consumer-grade”, much of the complexity of such concepts as
“proposed terms” needs to be hidden behind reasonable defaults. 
 
 1.2 Vendor initiates a new relationship with a Customer 
<p>“As a Vendor, I want to offer initiating a new relationship with a Customer.”</p>
<p>Similar as for “Customer initiates a new relationship with a Vendor”, but with reversed roles.</p>
 1.3 Customer and Vendor agree on a closer relationship 
<p>“The Customer and the Vendor agree on a closer relationship.”</p>
<p>Description:</p>
 
 The Customer and the Vendor have been in a relationship governed by certain terms for some time. 
 Now, either the Customer or the Vendor propose new terms to the other party, and the other party
accepts. 
 The new terms permit all activities permitted by the old terms, plus some additional
ones. 
 
<p>Example:</p>
 
 The Customer has agreed with the Vendor that the Vendor may send the Customer product updates once a month.
For that purpose, the Customer has provided Vendor an e-mail address (but no physical address). 
 Now, the Customer has decided to purchase a product from Vendor. To ship it, the Vendor needs to have
the Customer’s shipping address. New terms that also include the shipping address are being
negotiated. 
 
 1.4 A Customer wants a more distant relationship 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to limit the Vendor to more restrictive terms.”</p>
<p>Description:</p>
 
 The Customer and the Vendor have been in a relationship governed by certain terms for some time. 
 Now, the Customer wishes to disallow certain activities previously allowed by the terms, without
terminating the relationship. 
 The Customer offers new terms, which the Vendor may or may not accept. The Vendor may offer alternate
terms in turn. This negotiation continues until either mutually acceptable terms are
found, or the relationship terminates. 
 
<p>Examples:</p>
 
 The Customer has agreed with the Vendor that the Vendor may send the Customer product updates. Now the Customer
decides that they do not wish to receive product updates more frequently than once
a quarter. 
 The Customer has agreed to behavioral profiling when visiting Vendor’s website. Now, while the Customer
still wishes to use the website, they do no longer consent to the behavioral profiling. 
 
 2. Category: Ongoing relationship 
<p>What happens during a relationship after it has been established and while no
party has the intention of either modifying the strength of, or even leaving
the relationship.</p>
 2.1 Intentcasting 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to publish, to a selection of Vendors that I trust, that I wish to purchase a
product with description X”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Convenience for Customer 
 Potential for a non-standard deal (e.g. I am a well-known influencer, and the seller
makes Customer a special deal) 
 
<p>Features:</p>
 
 It’s basically a shopping list
 
 free-form text 
 plus “terms” (FIXME: open issue) 
 
 
 Retailers can populate product alternatives for each item in the list
 
 might simply be a search at the retailer site 
 but terms need to be computable 
 
 
 
<p>Issues:</p>
 
 what if a retailer lies and spams with unrelated products, or unavailable products? 
 
 2.2 Automated intentcasting on my behalf 
<p>“As a Customer, I want an ‘AI’ running on my behalf to issue Intentcasts when it is in my interest”</p>
<p>Description:</p>
 
 This is similar to functionality deployed by some retailers today: “We noticed you have
not bought diapers in the last 30 days. Aren’t you about to run low? Here are some offers”.
But this functionality runs on my behalf, and takes data from all sorts of places into
account. 
 
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Convenience, time savings 
 
 2.3 Contextual product reviews and ratings 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to see reviews and ratings of the product and seller alternatives for any
of my shopping list items.”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Same as product reviews in silos, but without the silos: have access to more reviews
and ratings by more people 
 Seller alternatives give Customer more choice 
 
 2.4 Filter offers by interest 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to receive offers that match my implicitly declared interest”</p>
<p>Description:</p>
 
 In Intentcasting, I actively publish my intent to meet a need I know I have by
purchasing a product 
 This is about offers in response to needs, or benefits, that I have not explicitly
declared but that can be inferred. Example: if I have purchased a laser printer
6 months ago, and I have not purchased replacement toner cartridges nor have I declared
an intent to purchase some, I would appreciate offers for such toner cartridges (but
not of inkjet cartridges) 
 
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Convenience for Customer 
 Better response rate for Vendor 
 
 2.5 Full contact record 
<p>“As a Customer, I want a full record of all interactions between Customer and each Vendor accessible in a single place.”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Simplicity &amp; Convenience 
 Trackability 
 Similar to CRM 
 
<p>Notes:</p>
 
 This should cover all modes of communication, from e-mail to trouble tickets,
voice calls and home visits. 
 
 2.6 Manage trusted Vendor’s in a single place 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to see and manage my list of trusted Vendors in a single place”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Simplicity 
 Transparency (to Customer) 
 
<p>Notes:</p>
 
 Probably should also have a non-trusted Vendor’s: so my banned vendors are maintained
in the same place — which subset is being displayed is just a filter function 
 Probably should have a list of all Vendor’s ever interacted with 
 
 2.7 Notify of changes about products I’m interested in 
<p>“As a Customer, I want be notified of important changes (e.g. price) in products that I’m interested in.”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 can use my shopping cart as a “price watch list” and purchase when I think the
price is right 
 
<p>Notes:</p>
 
 This should apply to items in my shopping cart, but also items in product lists that
I might have created (“save for later” lists) 
 
 2.8 Personal wallet 
<p>“As a Customer, I want my own wallet that I can use with any Vendor”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Simplicity &amp; Convenience 
 Unified billing 
 
<p>Notes:</p>
 
 Unified ceremony 
 Should be able to delegate to the payment network of my choice 
 
 2.9 Preventative maintenance 
<p>“As a Customer, I would like to be notified of my options when a product I own needs maintenance”</p>
<p>Description:</p>
 
 If I have a water heater, and it is about to fail, I would like to be notified that
it is about to fail, with offers for what to do about it. It’s a kind of
<a>intentcasting</a>
but the intent is inferred from the fact that I own the product, the product is about
to fail, that I don’t want it to fail and I am willing to entertain offers from
the vendor I bought it from and others. 
 
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Convenience for Customer 
 No service interruption 
 
 2.10 Product clouds 
<p>“Each product instance has its own cloud”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Collects information over the lifetime of the product instance 
 Product instance-specific 
 Can change ownership with the product 
 Does not disappear with the vendor 
 
<p>Example:</p>
 
 My water heater has its own cloud. It knows usage, and maintenance events.
It continues to work even if the vendor of the water heater goes out of business. 
 
 2.11 Product info in context 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to access product documentation, available instruction manuals etc in the
context of the purchase that I made”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Simplicity &amp; Convenience 
 Updated documentation, new materials etc show up automatically 
 
 2.12 Set and monitor terms for relationships 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to set terms for my relationship with a Vendor in a single place”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Simplicity &amp; Convenience 
 Privacy &amp; Agency 
 
<p>Notes:</p>
 
 Originally this was only about terms for provided personal data, but it appears
this is a broader issue: I also want to set terms for, say, dispute resolution
(“I never consent to arbitration”) or customer support (“must agree to never let
Customer wait on the phone for more than 30min”) 
 
 2.13 Update information in a single place only 
<p>“As a Customer, I (only) want to update my personal contact information in one place that I control”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 for Customer: convenience 
 for Vendor: more accurate information 
 
<p>Issues:</p>
 
 Should that be a copy and update-copy process (push), or a copy and update-on-need
process (pull with copy) or a fetch-and-discard process (pull without copy)? 
 
<p>Notes:</p>
 
 Originally phrased as only about contact info (name, married name, shipping address,
phone number etc) this probably applies to other types of information was well, such
as, say, credit card numbers, loyalty club memberships, even dietary preferences or
interests (“I gave up stamp collecting”) 
 
 2.14 Single shopping cart 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to use a single shopping cart for all e-commerce sites on the web.”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 I don’t need to create accounts on many websites, or login into many websites 
 I decide when the collection of items in the cart expires and I don’t lose work 
 It makes it easier for Customer to shop at more sites, and I can more easily buy from the long tail of sites 
 
<p>Features:</p>
 
 It shows product and seller 
 It may show alternate sellers and difference in terms (e.g. price, shipping, speed) 
 We may also want to have product lists that aren’t a shopping cart (“save for later”
lists) 
 
 2.15 Unified communications/notifications preferences 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to manage my communication/notification preferences with all Vendors
in a single place”</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
 
 In a single place, and in a single manner. I should not have to do things differently
to unsubscribe from the product newsletter of vendors X and Y. 
 
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Simplicity &amp; Convenience 
 
 2.16 Unified product feedback 
<p>“As a Customer, I want a uniform way to submit (positive and negative) product feedback (and
receive responses) with any Vendor”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Simplicity &amp; Convenience 
 Trackability 
 Similar to CRM 
 
<p>Notes:</p>
 
 Should be easy to do this either privately or publicly 
 
 2.17 Unified purchase history 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to have a record of all my product purchases in a single place”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Simplicity &amp; Convenience 
 If I wish to re-order a product I purchased before, I can easily find it and the
vendor that I got it from 
 
 2.18 Unified subscriptions management 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to manage all my ongoing product subscriptions in a single place”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Simplicity &amp; Convenience 
 Expense management 
 
<p>Note:</p>
 
 This is implied by the source, not explicitly mentioned. 
 
<p>Future:</p>
 
 Opens up possibilities for subscription bundle business models 
 
 2.19 Unified support experience 
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Simplicity &amp; Convenience 
 Trackability 
 Similar to CRM 
 
<p>Notes:</p>
 
 Should be multi-modal: trouble tickets, chat, e-mail, voice etc 
 
 3. Category: Beyond binary relationships 
<p>Use cases that involve more than one Customer, or more than one Vendor, or both.</p>
 3.1 Proven capabilities 
<p>“As a Vendor, I want to give another party (Customer or Vendor) the capabilities to perform certain operations”</p>
<p>Description:</p>
 
 This is SSI Object Capabilities 
 Example: I want to give my customer the ability to open a locker 
 The scenario should be robust with respect to confidentiality and accuracy. 
 
 3.2 Silo-free product reviews 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to publish my reviews and ratings about products I own so they can be
used by any other Customer at any point of purchase”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Same as product reviews in silos, but without the silos: broader distribution of
my review for more benefit by more people 
 
<p>Notes:</p>
 
 Rephrased from “express genuine loyalty” 
 
 3.3 Monitoring of terms violation 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to be notified if other Customer’s interacting with a Vendor report a violation of their terms”</p>
<p>Description:</p>
 
 I have a relationship with a Vendor, and we have agreed to certain terms. If the Vendor breaks
those terms, and other Customer’s in a similar relationship with the Vendor notice that, I want
to be notified. 
 
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Trust, security, safety 
 
<p>Notes:</p>
 
 This can of course be abused through fake reports, so suitable measures must be taken. 
 
 3.4 Unified health and wellness records 
<p>“As a Customer, I want my health and wellness records from all sources to be aggregated in a
place that I control.”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Survives disappearance of the vendor 
 Privacy 
 Allows cross-data-source personal analytics and insights 
 Integration across healthcare (regulated industry) and wellness (consumer) 
 
 3.5 Verified credentials 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to be able to tell Vendor 1 that Vendor 2 makes a claim about Customer.”</p>
<p>Description:</p>
 
 This is the SSI verified credential use case 
 Example: I want to tell a potential employer that I have earned a certain degress
from a certain institution 
 The scenario should be robust with respect to confidentiality and accuracy. 
 
 4. Category: Ending the relationship 
<p>What happens when one of the parties wishes to end the relationship.</p>
 4.1 Banning the vendor 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to permanently ban a Vendor from doing business with Customer ever again.”</p>
<p>Description:</p>
 
 This form of ending the relationship means that I don’t want to be told of offers
or responses to Intentcasts etc. by this vendor ever again. 
 
 4.2 Disassociating from the vendor 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to stop interacting with a vendor at this time but I am open to
future interactions.”</p>
<p>Description:</p>
 
 This probably means that data sharing and other interaction reset to the level of
how it was before the relationship was established. However, the Customer and the Vendor do not
need to go through the technical introduction ceremony again when the relationship
is revived. 
 
 4.3 Firing the customer 
<p>“As a Vendor, I want to stop interacting with a particular Customer.”</p>
<p>Description:</p>
 
 For customers (or non-customers) that the Vendor does not wish to serve (e.g. because of
excessive support requests), the VendorVendor may unilaterally terminate the relationship with
the Customer.

<p>テーマはデジタルアイデンティティなのですが、対談がちょうどJR東日本の駅構内カメラ設置問題の話題が盛り上がっていたときだったので、そこから話はいろいろと広く深く進んでいきました。</p>



<p>たいへん丁寧にまとめていただいたので、デジタルアイデンティティやプライバシーに対するクロサカさんと私の考え方や問題意識も、楽しみながら読んで理解していただけるのではないかと思います。結構ボリュームが有って、２回に分けての公開になっています。</p>

   Mark Zuckerberg recently dedicated a
long interview
to the subject, so the metaverse must be a thing. Promptly, the
chatter is exploding. Personally
I believe the metaverse is currently underhyped: it will be A Really Big Thing,
for consumers, and for businesses, and in particular for commerce and
collaboration, far beyond what we can grasp in video games and the likes today.

  <p>Mark Zuckerberg recently dedicated a
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588022/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-metaverse-interview">long interview</a>
to the subject, so the metaverse must be a thing. Promptly, the
<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=metaverse">chatter</a> is exploding. Personally
I believe the metaverse is currently underhyped: it will be A Really Big Thing,
for consumers, and for businesses, and in particular for commerce and
collaboration, far beyond what we can grasp in video games and the likes today.</p>
<p>So what is it, this metaverse thing? I want to share my definition, because I
think it is simple, and useful.</p>
<p>It’s best expressed in a two-by-two table:</p>

 
  
  
   How you access it:
   <br>
   physically vs. virtually
 
 
  
   Where it is:
   <br>
   in physical or virtual space
  
  
   The virtual world, accessed physically:
   <br>
   Augmented Reality
  
  
   The virtual world, accessed virtually:
   <br>
   today's internet and future virtual worlds
  
 
 
  
   The physical world, accessed physically:
   <br>
   our ancestors exclusively lived here
  
  
   The physical world, accessed virtually:
   <br>
   the Internet of Things
  
 

<p>By way of explanation:</p>
 
 
<p>There is physical space – the physical world around us – and
virtual space, the space of pure information, that only exists on computers.</p>
 
 
<p>Our ancestors, and we so far, have mostly been interacting with physical space
by touching it physically.
But in recent decades, we have learned to access it from the information
sphere, and that’s usually described as the Internet of Things:
if you run an app to control your lights, or open your garage door, that’s
what I’m talking about.</p>
 
 
<p>So far, we have mostly interacted with virtual space through special-purpose
devices that form the gateway to the virtual space: first computers,
now phones and in the future: headsets. I call this accessing virtual space
virtually.</p>
 
 
<p>And when we don our smart glasses, and wave our arms, we interact with
virtual space from physical space, which is the last quadrant.</p>
 
 
<p>In my definition, those four quadrants together form the metaverse:
the metaverse is a superset of both meatspace and cyberspace, so to speak.</p>
<p>This definition has been quite helpful for me to understand what various
projects are working on.</p>

    What are we asking the questions for? <p>This <a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo/archive">link gives you access to all the articles and archives</a> for &lt;/Hello CDO&gt;</p><p>This article unpacks questions and framing as I tend to focus on the conflicts, tensions, and compromises that face any CDO in the first 100 days — ranging from the effects of a poor job description to how a company’s culture means that data-led decisions are not decisions.</p><br><br><p></p><p><br></p><p>I love this <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/dana_kanze_the_real_reason_female_entrepreneurs_get_less_funding">TED talk</a> from <a href="https://www.london.edu/faculty-and-research/faculty-profiles/d/dana-kanze">Dana Kanze</a> at LSE.&nbsp; Dana’s talk builds on the research of <a href="https://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/mygsb/faculty/research/pubfiles/529/HIGGINSADVANCES_1998REG_FOC_.pdf">Tory Higgins</a> who is credited with creating the social theory “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_focus_theory">Regulatory Focus</a>”&nbsp; This is a good <a href="https://psychology.wikia.org/wiki/Regulatory_Focus_Theory">summary</a> if you have not run into it before.</p><p>Essentially the idea behind “Regulatory Focus” is to explore motivations and routes to getting the outcome you want. The context in this article is to explore how a framed approach to questions creates biased outcomes. One framing in Regulatory Focus centres on a “Promotion Focus” which looks for “gain” which can be translated as finding or seeking hope, advancement and accomplishment.&nbsp; The counter is a prevention focus that centres on losses that looks to find safety, responsibility and security.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In Dana’s research, which is the basis for her talk about why women get less venture funding, she categorises “Promotion” questions as ones that will ask the following questions as they seek to focus on GAIN. When talking about: customers seeks data about acquisition, income looking for data to confirm sales, Market seeking to understand the size,&nbsp; Balance Sheet will want to know data on assets, projections should focus on growth and questions on strategy will want to understand the vision.&nbsp;</p><p>Dana’s research shows that “Prevention” questions will be framed as LOSSES, therefore a focus on customers would seek data on retention, income questions look for data on margin, market questions would focus on shape, balance sheet questions will centre on liability, projection data wants to confirm stability, and strategy to ensure execution capability.</p><p>Whilst Dana has collected this data as part of a noble and useful study on why women get less funding from venture capital, investors tend to bias and ask women prevention questions with a framing away from gain towards losses and downside risk.&nbsp; However, we should reflect on this data and research for a little longer.</p><p>Does your executive team tend to focus on promotion or prevention questions? &nbsp;Do different executive roles tend to frame their questions based on gain (upside) or loss prevention (risk)?&nbsp; Is the person leading the questions critical to the decision-making unit and will their questions frame promotion or prevention for the company.&nbsp; Whilst a rounded team should ask both, do they?</p><p>As the CDO, our role is to find “all data.” and not data to fit a question. Data that shows your company's approach to how they frame questions for Prevention or Promotion is just data,&nbsp; but this data will help you as a team make better decisions.&nbsp;</p><p>A specific challenge in the first 100 days is to determine what questions we, as a leadership team, ask ourselves and how our framing is biasing our choices and decisions.&nbsp; We are unlikely to like this data and how power aligns with those who prevent or promote a proposal or recommendation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Based on listening to questions and those in communications, I have been building an ontology of questions and been categorising them for a while now.&nbsp; I am interested both in the absolute bias, the bias to people, the bias to project types and also how bais changes depending on who is leading the project and questions.&nbsp; Based on a sample size that is not statistical, I believe that Dana’s work has far wider implications than just venture funding.&nbsp;</p><p>---</p><p>Whilst our ongoing agile iteration into <a href="https://opengovernance.net/what-occurs-when-physical-beings-transition-to-information-beings-146ea9dcbca3">information beings</a> is never-ending, there are the first 100 days in the new role. But what to focus on? Well, that rose-tinted period of conflicting priorities is what <a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo/">&lt;/Hello, CDO!&gt;</a> is all about. Maintaining sanity when all else has been lost to untested data assumptions is a different problem entirely.</p>

<p>The latest version of the â€œOAuth 2.0 Demonstration of Proof-of-Possession at the Application Layer (DPoP)â€ specification adds an option for servers to supply a nonce value to be included in the DPoP proof.  Both authorization servers and resource servers can provide nonce values to clients.</p>
<p>As described in the updated Security Considerations, the nonce prevents a malicious party in control of the client (who might be a legitimate end-user) from pre-generating DPoP proofs to be used in the future and exfiltrating them to a machine without the DPoP private key.  When server-provided nonces are used, actual possession of the proof-of-possession key is being demonstrated — not just possession of a DPoP proof.</p>

Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@andrewcoop?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Andrew Coop</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a><p>Since 2016, a growing number of digital identity experts have worked together to create privacy preserving, digitally native, trusted credentials, which enable the secure sharing of data from decentralized locations. U.S., Canadian, and European Governments see how this technology can provide superior data protection for its citizens, while enabling global data sharing — that’s why they have invested more than $16 million USD into this space over the past several&nbsp;years.</p><p>On September 15, 2021, I moderated a panel with representatives from the United States Government, the Canadian Government, and the European Commission. Below is an edited excerpt from the panel that included:</p>  Anil John, Technical Director of the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/svip">Silicon Valley Innovation Program</a> which has invested $8 million on R&amp;D, proof of concepts, product development, refinement, and a digital wallet UI competition.  Tim Bouma, Senior Policy Analyst for identity management at the Treasury Board secretariat at of the Government of Canada. The <a href="https://github.com/canada-ca/ucvdcc">User-centric Verifiable Digital Credentials Challenge</a> has awarded $4 million CAD in two&nbsp;phases.  Olivier Bringer, Head of the <a href="https://www.ngi.eu/">Next-Generation Internet</a> at the European commission and under his program, he has awarded about € 6 million euros through three open calls for EID and SSI solutions.  Heather Vescent, Co-Chair of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/">Credentials Community Group</a> which incubates many of the open standards in this space &amp; an author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Comprehensive-Guide-Self-Sovereign-Identity-ebook/dp/B07Q3TXLDP/">The Comprehensive Guide to Self Sovereign Identity</a>.   Policy and Technology <p>Heather Vescent: Policy tends to be squishy while technology and especially technology standards must be precise. What challenges do you face implementing policy decisions into technology?</p><p>Anil John: Our two primary work streams come out of the oldest parts of the U.S. government: U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection.</p><p>Immigration credentials must be available to anyone regardless of their technical savvy or infrastructure availability. The USCIS team is focused on leaving nobody behind, and do not have the luxury of pivoting to a digital only model. Technology has to provide credentials in electronic format, as well as on paper — each with a high degree of verification validation.</p><p>U.S. Customs has to deal with every single entity that is shipping goods into the U.S. We don’t have any choice but to be globally interoperable, because while we may be the largest customs organization on the planet, we do not want to mandate a single platform or technology stack. Interoperability is critical so that everybody has a choice in the technology that they are&nbsp;using.</p><p>It is easy to get pushback about why we are doing this long public process, rather than put money into a vendor and buy their technology. One of the reasons we made the decision to work in public, under the remit of a global standards organization, was to ensure that we were not repeating past mistakes where we were locked into particular vendors or platforms. In the past, we were locked into proprietary APIs, with high switching costs, left with the care and feeding of legacy systems that were very uniquely government centric. There are benefits to develop technology in the public from a solution choice and a public interest perspective.</p><p>Tim Bouma: The challenge is that you have to deal with short term exigencies, and combine that with a long-term vision to come up with requirements that are fairly timeless. Because once you develop the requirements, they have to last for a decade or more. This forces you to think of what the timeless requirements might be. In order to do that, you have to understand the technology very deeply. You have to understand the abstraction, so you can come up with language that can serve the test of&nbsp;time.</p><p>Olivier Bringer: I agree that it can be a challenge to implement policy choices into technology; but it can also be an opportunity. Innovators have not waited for the European General Data Protection Regulation before developing privacy preserving technologies. This is an opportunity for companies, an opportunity for administration, an opportunity for innovators to develop new technologies and new business&nbsp;models.</p><blockquote>“Policy is an opportunity to implement fundamental rights into technology.” — Olivier&nbsp;Bringer</blockquote><p>In NGI we try to take the policy development, the regulations that we have, as an opportunity to implement our fundamental rights, an opportunity to implement the law into technology. Our program supports innovators, the adoption of their technologies, their solutions, and their integration into standards. We do that firstly in Europe, but our ambition is to link to the global environment and work in cooperation with&nbsp;others.</p> A Benefit to&nbsp;Citizens <p>Vescent: What would you tell your citizens is the most important reason to invest in this infrastructure and businesses that use&nbsp;it?</p><p>Bringer: First that we are funding technologies, which are, this is our motto, human centric. So returning to your first question, going beyond pure policy development, we think it’s really important to develop the technology. So next to the regulation that we put in place in the field of electronic identity, in the field of AI, in the field of data protection, it’s important to fund the technologies that will implement these policies and regulation. This is really what we try to do when we build an internet that’s more trustworthy, that gives more control to the users in terms of the data they disclose, in terms of control of their identity online, in terms of including everyone in this increasingly important digital environment. It is technology geared towards the&nbsp;citizen.</p><p>John: I’m going to answer for myself, rather than speak for my organization. Having said that, I think what I would tell [citizens] would be that we want to make your life more secure, and more privacy-respecting, without leaving anybody behind. These are the first technologies that have come along that give us a hope in ensuring that we’re not trapped by nefarious or corporate or money interests. That there is a choice in the marketplace in what is available to our citizens in how they access it. And we absolutely are not ignoring the people who may not have a level of comfort with digital technologies and leaving them behind, but ensuring that there is a clear bridge with this technology to what their level of comfort&nbsp;is.</p><p>Bouma: We are moving to a notion of a digital economy, and it’s more than some slogan. We are building a digital infrastructure that is becoming a critical infrastructure. It is important that we understand that we develop the capabilities that ensure that the citizens actually feel safe. This is as fundamental as having safe drinking water and a regulated electricity supply. So now we need to start thinking about the digital capabilities, verifiable credentials included, as part of the national and international infrastructure.</p><p>We’re doing proof of concepts and pilots on national digital infrastructure, to understand what it means, to use a Canadian metaphor, create a “set of rails” that goes across the country. What would that look like? What are the capabilities? At the end of the day, we need to build services that can be trusted by Canadians and everyone. And there’s a lot of engineering and a lot of policy work that has to go into&nbsp;that.</p> Most Surprising Lesson <p>Vescent: What’s the most surprising thing you’ve learned since the inception of your investment programs.?</p><p>Bouma: I had a major shift in perspective. There are other technical ecosystems we have to take into account, like the mobile driver’s license, the digital travel credentials, and others. So, we have to figure out how to incorporate all those requirements. The mantra I’ve been using is, we’ve got these different technical ecosystems but we have to focus on the human being — the point of integration is at the digital wallet. So that’s reframed my policy thinking — there’s a multiplicity of technical ecosystems that we have to account from a policy point of&nbsp;view.</p><p>Bringer: I’m impressed by the quality of the innovators. We have people who are very good in technology who understand the political challenges, the policy context in which they intervene and who are able to make excellent contribution to our own policy, and who are really dedicated to our human centric&nbsp;vision.</p><p>John: I’ll give you one positive one, one negative. On the positive side, I am happy there is a community of people that understands there is value in working together to ensure the shared infrastructure that we are all using has a common foundation of security, privacy, and interoperability — that it is not a zero-sum game. They can compete on top of a common foundation.</p><p>On the negative side, I’m fascinated by the shenanigans being pulled by people who use the theater of interoperability in order to pedal proprietary solutions. Fortunately, I think a lot of the public sector entities are getting more educated so that they can see through the interoperability theater.</p><p>Curious for more? Watch the full panel.

<p>I’ve just rediscovered two digital assets that I’d forgotten about.</p>
<p>1. The Reddit username judell, which I created in 2005 and never used. When you visit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/judell">the page</a> it says “hmm… u/judell hasn’t posted anything” but also reports, in my Trophy Case, that I belong to the 15-year club.</p>
<p>2. The Amazon AWS S3 bucket named simply jon, which I created in 2006 for an <a href="http://jonudell.net/udell/2006-03-22-towards-politically-neutral-infrastructure-amazons-s3.html">InfoWorld blog post</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060330221659/https://www.infoworld.com/article/06/03/22/76555_13OPstrategic_1.html">companion column</a> about the birth of Amazon Web Services. As Wikipedia’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Amazon_Web_Services#Full_timeline">timeline</a> shows, AWS started in March of that year.</p>
<p>Care to guess the odds that I could still access both of these assets after leaving them in limbo for 15 years?</p>
<p>Spoiler alert: it was a coin flip.</p>
<p>I’ve had no luck with Reddit so far. The email account I signed up with no longer exists. The support folks kindly switched me to a current email but it’s somehow linked to Educational_Elk_7869 not to judell. I guess we may still get it sorted but the point is that I was not at all surprised by this loss of continuity. I’ve lost control of all kinds of digital assets over the years, including the above-cited InfoWorld article which only Wayback (thank you as always!) now remembers. </p>
<p>When I turned my attention to AWS S3 I was dreading a similar outcome. I’d gone to Microsoft not long after I made that AWS developer account; my early cloud adventures were all in Azure; could I still access those long-dormant AWS resources? Happily: yes. </p>
<p>Here’s the backstory from that 2006 blog post:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Naming</p>
<p>The name of the bucket is jon. The bucket namespace is global which means that as long as jon is owned by my S3 developer account, nobody else can use that name. Will this lead to a namespace land grab? We’ll see. Meanwhile, I’ve got mine, and although I may never again top Jon Stewart as Google’s #1 Jon, his people are going to have to talk to my people if they want my Amazon bucket.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m not holding my breath waiting for an offer. Bucket names never mattered in the way domain names do. Still, I would love to be pleasantly surprised!</p>
<p>My newfound interest in AWS is, of course, because Steampipe wraps SQL around a <a href="https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/aws/tables">whole bunch of AWS APIs</a> including <a href="https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/aws/tables/aws_s3_bucket">the one for S3 buckets</a>. So, for example, when exactly did I create that bucket? Of course I can log into the AWS console and click my way to the answer. But I’m all about SQL lately so instead I can do this.</p>
 &gt; select name, arn, creation_date from aws_s3_bucket 
+-------+--------------------+---------------------+         
| name  | arn                | creation_date       |         
+-------+--------------------+---------------------+         
| jon   | arn:aws:s3:::jon   | 2006-03-16 08:16:12 |         
| luann | arn:aws:s3:::luann | 2007-04-26 14:47:45 |         
+-------+--------------------+---------------------+  
 
<p>Oh, and there’s the other one I made for <a href="https://www.luannudell.com/">Luann</a> the following year. These are pretty cool ARNs (<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html">Amazon Resource Names</a>)! I should probably do something with them; the names you can get nowadays are more like Educational_Elk_7869. </p>
<p>Anyway I’m about to learn a great deal about the many AWS APIs that Steampipe can query, <a href="https://hub.steampipe.io/mods/turbot/aws_compliance">check for policy compliance</a>, and join with <a href="https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins">the APIs of other services</a>. Meanwhile it’s fun to recall that I wrote one of the first reviews of the inaugural AWS product and, in the process, laid claim to some very special S3 bucket names.</p>

<p>I’ve been building and working with REST APIs for many years now. Recently, however, I’ve been spending more and more of my time working with (and building) GraphQL-based APIs.</p>

<p>While GraphQL has generally made my life easier, especially as I’ve been building and consuming more data-heavy APIs, there is still one extremely annoying problem I’ve run into over and over again: lack of GraphQL support for third-party APIs I need to consume.</p>

<p>If I’m trying to use a third-party API service that doesn’t have a GraphQL endpoint, I either need to:</p>

 
 Download, install, configure, and learn how to use their custom REST API clients (which takes a lot of time and means my codebase is now a bit cluttered), or 
 Build my own GraphQL proxy for their service… But this is a big task. I’ve got to read through all their REST API docs and carefully define GraphQL schemas for everything, learning all the ins and outs of their API as I go. 
 

<p>In short: it’s a lot of work either way, but if I really want to use GraphQL everywhere I have to work for it.</p>

<p>In an ideal world, every API service would have a GraphQL endpoint, this way I could just use a single GraphQL library to query all the API services I need to talk to.</p>

<p>Luckily, one of my favorite developer tools, <a href="https://stepzen.com/" title="StepZen">StepZen</a> (disclaimer: I advise them), has made this problem a lot less painful.</p>

 What StepZen Does 

<p>StepZen is a platform that lets you host a GraphQL endpoint to use in your applications. But, more importantly, they’ve designed a schema system that lets you import (or build your own) GraphQL wrappers for just about anything: REST APIs, databases, etc. It’s really neat!</p>

<p>Using the StepZen CLI, for example, I can create a new GraphQL endpoint that allows me to talk with the <a href="https://www.airtable.com/" title="Airtable">Airtable</a> and <a href="https://www.fedex.com/en-us/home.html" title="FedEx">FedEx</a> APIs, neither of which support GraphQL natively. The beautiful thing is, I don’t even need to write a GraphQL wrapper for this myself since someone else already did!</p>

<p>Here’s what this looks like (assuming you’ve already got the <a href="https://stepzen.com/docs/cli" title="StepZen CLI">StepZen CLI</a> installed and initialized):</p>

 <code>$ stepzen import airtable
$ stepzen import fedex
$ stepzen start
</code> 

<p>Using the <code>import</code> command, StepZen will download the publicly available GraphQL schemas for these services (Airtable and FedEx) to your local directory. The <code>start</code> command then launches a GraphQL explorer on localhost, port 5000, which you can use to interactively query the Airtable and FexEx APIs using GraphQL! Pretty neat!</p>

<p></p>

 How to Access Public GraphQL Schemas 

<p>So, let’s say you want to use GraphQL to query an API service that doesn’t support GraphQL. If you’re using StepZen, you can find all the publicly available (official) schemas on the <a href="https://github.com/steprz/stepzen-schemas" title="StepZen Schemas on GitHub">StepZen Schemas repo</a> on GitHub. This repo is namespaced, so if you see a folder in the project, you can use the <code>stepzen import</code> command on it directly. At the time of writing, there are 24 publicly available GraphQL schemas you can instantly use.</p>

<p>StepZen currently has support for lots of popular developer services: <a href="https://disqus.com/api/docs/" title="Disqus API">Disqus</a>, <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/rest" title="GitHub API">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://shopify.dev/api/admin/rest/reference" title="Shopify API">Shopify</a>, etc.</p>

<p>You can, of course, create your own GraphQL schemas as well.</p>

 The Problem I Ran Into with GraphQL 

<p>Several months ago I was working on a simple user-facing web app. The entire backend of the app was using GraphQL and I was trying to keep the codebase as pure as possible, which meant not using any REST APIs directly.</p>

<p>In all my years of building web apps, I’ve always used a REST API at some point. So this was a bit of an experiment to see whether or not I could build my app without cluttering my codebase with REST API clients or requests.</p>

<p>As I was working on the app, I went to use one of my favorite free API services, <a href="https://randomuser.me/" title="Random User">Random User</a>. If you haven’t heard of it before, it’s a publicly available REST API you can hit to generate realistic-looking fake users. It’s incredible for building a development environment, using seed data in an app, or creating real-world-looking MVPs. I use it all the time.</p>

<p>I knew going into this process that the Random User API didn’t have a GraphQL endpoint, so I figured I’d spend some time creating one for them.</p>

 How to Convert a REST API to GraphQL 

<p>My goal, as I mentioned above, was to build a GraphQL endpoint for the Random User REST API.</p>

<p>In order to make this work, what you have to do is translate your REST API so the <a href="https://stepzen.com/" title="StepZen">StepZen service</a> can understand which endpoints you are hitting and what types of inputs and outputs they require.</p>

<p>Once you’ve defined all this, StepZen will be able to create a GraphQL endpoint for your app. When your app queries the StepZen GraphQL endpoint, StepZen will translate your GraphQL request into the proper REST API call, execute the request, then translate the response and send it back to your app in standard GraphQL format.</p>

<p>Here’s how you can convert any REST API to GraphQL using StepZen, step-by-step.</p>

 Step 1: Read Through the REST API Docs and Identify Endpoints to Convert 

<p>The first part of converting any REST API to GraphQL is to fully understand what endpoints you want to convert from REST to GraphQL.</p>

<p>In my case, the Random User API only has a single endpoint, so this isn’t complicated. But, let’s say you’re converting a large, popular API like <a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/api" title="Twilio API">Twilio</a> that has many endpoints… This can be much more difficult.</p>

<p>To make things simpler, here’s what I recommend: when converting a REST API to GraphQL, identify the endpoints you actually need and ignore the rest. Trying to build an entire abstraction layer for a massive API like Twilio would be difficult, so instead, focus only on the key endpoints you need to use. In the future, if you need to use additional endpoints, you can always add support for them.</p>

<p>NOTE: This is especially true if you’re using StepZen. It’s incredibly easy to support additional endpoints in StepZen once you have a basic schema going, so don’t feel bad about focusing on the important ones and ignoring the rest.</p>

<p>Following this just-in-time pattern will help save you time and get you back to working on the important stuff.</p>

 Step 2: Understand the REST Endpoint’s Schema 

<p>Every API endpoint has some sort of schema. For example, the Random User API, when queried, returns a blob of JSON similar to the following:</p>

 <code>{
  "results": [
    {
      "gender": "male",
      "name": {
        "title": "mr",
        "first": "brad",
        "last": "gibson"
      },
      "location": {
        "street": "9278 new road",
        "city": "kilcoole",
        "state": "waterford",
        "postcode": "93027",
        "coordinates": {
          "latitude": "20.9267",
          "longitude": "-7.9310"
        },
        "timezone": {
          "offset": "-3:30",
          "description": "Newfoundland"
        }
      },
      "email": "brad.gibson@example.com",
      "login": {
        "uuid": "155e77ee-ba6d-486f-95ce-0e0c0fb4b919",
        "username": "silverswan131",
        "password": "firewall",
        "salt": "TQA1Gz7x",
        "md5": "dc523cb313b63dfe5be2140b0c05b3bc",
        "sha1": "7a4aa07d1bedcc6bcf4b7f8856643492c191540d",
        "sha256": "74364e96174afa7d17ee52dd2c9c7a4651fe1254f471a78bda0190135dcd3480"
      },
      "dob": {
        "date": "1993-07-20T09:44:18.674Z",
        "age": 26
      },
      "registered": {
        "date": "2002-05-21T10:59:49.966Z",
        "age": 17
      },
      "phone": "011-962-7516",
      "cell": "081-454-0666",
      "id": {
        "name": "PPS",
        "value": "0390511T"
      },
      "picture": {
        "large": "https://randomuser.me/api/portraits/men/75.jpg",
        "medium": "https://randomuser.me/api/portraits/med/men/75.jpg",
        "thumbnail": "https://randomuser.me/api/portraits/thumb/men/75.jpg"
      },
      "nat": "IE"
    }
  ],
  "info": {
    "seed": "fea8be3e64777240",
    "results": 1,
    "page": 1,
    "version": "1.3"
  }
}
</code> 

<p>Since the purpose of the Random User API is to return random user data, I can clearly see in the JSON data many of the fields I might be interested in working with: <code>email</code>, <code>cell</code>, <code>username</code>, etc.</p>

<p>Once you’ve clearly identified the fields you want to make use of, move on to the next step.</p>

 Step 3: Create a Corresponding GraphQL Schema 

<p>Once you’ve figured out which fields you want to make use of, you need to define a <a href="https://graphql.org/learn/schema/" title="GraphQL Schema">GraphQL schema</a> that will tell the StepZen service how to understand the endpoint’s response.</p>

<p>You don’t need to be a wizard to do this, just pick out the important fields (and their types) from a REST API response, then build a corresponding GraphQL type.</p>

<p>For example, here’s the <code>RandomUser</code> type I defined based on the REST API output above:</p>

 <code>type RandomUser {
  gender: String!
  title: String!
  firstName: String!
  lastName: String!
  streetNumber: Int!
  streetName: String!
  city: String!
  state: String!
  country: String!
  postcode: String!
  latitude: String!
  longitude: String!
  timezoneOffset: String!
  timezoneDescription: String!
  email: String!
  uuid: String!
  username: String!
  password: String!
  salt: String!
  md5: String!
  sha1: String!
  sha256: String!
  dateOfBirth: Date!
  age: Int!
  registeredDate: DateTime!
  registeredAge: Int!
  phone: String!
  cell: String!
  largePicture: String!
  mediumPicture: String!
  thumbnailPicture: String!
  nationality: String!
}
</code> 

<p>As you can see, I simply defined the fields I care about from the REST response, along with their type.</p>

<p>NOTE: The exclamation point after many of these fields is to mark these fields as non-nullable. This means that no matter what, these fields should always be present in a response.</p>

<p>What you’ll want to do is create a new folder in your project and put this code into a file named <code>&lt;servicename&gt;.graphql</code>. In my case, I created the following directory tree and put the code into the <code>randomuser.graphql</code> file.</p>

 <code>randomuser
└─ randomuser.graphql
</code> 

 Step 4: Define a GraphQL Query 

<p>Once your data modeling is complete and you’ve defined your type(s), it’s time to define a special <code>Query</code> type that will tell the StepZen service how to communicate with the REST API you’re converting.</p>

<p>To get started, edit the <code>&lt;servicename&gt;.graphql</code> file and add the following <code>Query</code> definition:</p>

 <code>type Query {
  randomUser: RandomUser
    @rest(
      endpoint: "https://randomuser.me/api"
      resultroot: "results[]"
    )
}
</code> 

<p>This is a barebones query that essentially tells StepZen the <code>randomUser</code> query will return data of type <code>RandomUser</code> (which we defined in the previous step) and will get data by hitting the <code>https://randomuser.me/api</code> endpoint, then parsing the data out of the <code>results</code> JSON array field.</p>

<p>But… That’s not all! We still have more work to do.</p>

<p>When I defined the <code>RandomUser</code> type above, I decided to make all the data flat, and not nested like it was in the original REST API. This is because I don’t need any special nested fields when I generate a random user, I just want the data!</p>

<p>So, the next thing we need to do is explain to StepZen how to convert the nested JSON key/values into the custom schema I defined. To do this, we’ll use the <code>setters</code> REST directive StepZen provides:</p>

 <code>type Query {
  randomUser: RandomUser
    @rest(
      setters: [
        { field: "title", path: "name.title" }
        { field: "firstName", path: "name.first" }
        { field: "lastName", path: "name.last" }
        { field: "streetNumber", path: "location.street.number" }
        { field: "streetName", path: "location.street.name" }
        { field: "city", path: "location.city" }
        { field: "state", path: "location.state" }
        { field: "country", path: "location.country" }
        { field: "postcode", path: "location.postcode" }
        { field: "latitude", path: "location.coordinates.latitude" }
        { field: "longitude", path: "location.coordinates.longitude" }
        { field: "timezoneOffset", path: "location.timezone.offset" }
        { field: "timezoneDescription", path: "location.timezone.description" }
        { field: "uuid", path: "login.uuid" }
        { field: "username", path: "login.username" }
        { field: "password", path: "login.password" }
        { field: "salt", path: "login.salt" }
        { field: "md5", path: "login.md5" }
        { field: "sha1", path: "login.sha1" }
        { field: "sha256", path: "login.sha256" }
        { field: "dateOfBirth", path: "dob.date" }
        { field: "age", path: "dob.age" }
        { field: "registeredDate", path: "registered.date" }
        { field: "registeredAge", path: "registered.age" }
        { field: "largePicture", path: "picture.large" }
        { field: "mediumPicture", path: "picture.medium" }
        { field: "thumbnailPicture", path: "picture.thumbnail" }
        { field: "nationality", path: "nat" }
      ]
      endpoint: "https://randomuser.me/api"
      resultroot: "results[]"
    )
}
</code> 

<p>Using the <code>setters</code> directive, we’re able to tell StepZen which fields in our <code>RandomUser</code> type can be supplied by which nested paths from the raw REST API JSON data. Neat!</p>

<p>There are lots of other things you can define using StepZen, so even if you have an incredibly complex endpoint there are always ways to support it. To learn more about this, you might want to read through the <a href="https://stepzen.com/docs/connecting-backends/how-to-connect-a-rest-service">StepZen docs</a> on the subject.</p>

 Step 5: Define the API Metadata 

<p>Once you’ve finished defining the data model and query, the next thing you’ll want to do is prepare your GraphQL API schema for production!</p>

<p>In my case, I wanted to contribute my schema back to the StepZen developer community, so I forked the <a href="https://github.com/steprz/stepzen-schemas" title="StepZen Schemas Repo">stepzen-schemas repo</a> and created a new top-level folder named <code>randomuser</code> in which I put my query/data model from above.</p>

<p>I then wrote up a README and created  a <code>stepzen.config.json</code> file which provides details about this schema:</p>

 <code>{
  "name": "RandomUser",
  "description": "Generates random users for testing purposes using the randomuser.me API.",
  "categories": ["Dev Tools"]
}
</code> 

<p>Notice how all I’m providing is a <code>name</code>, <code>description</code>, and any relevant <code>categories</code> this schema fits into.</p>

<p>Finally, I opened a pull request to the StepZen repo and the maintainers tested and merged my schema into the repo so anyone could use it!</p>

<p>Now, if you have no interest in creating a public GraphQL schema for the REST API you’re converting, you can obviously skip this step. So long as you have a folder with your service name and your data model/queries defined, you can use StepZen to run your endpoint regardless of whether or not your schema is publicly available to the world.</p>

 Using Your Converted REST API 

<p>Once you’ve built a schema that teaches StepZen how to talk to the REST API, how do you actually use it?</p>

<p>Well, in the example above, I built a public-facing StepZen schema and contributed it back to the community. In this case, I can simply use this schema like I would any other:</p>

 <code>$ stepzen import randomuser
$ stepzen start
</code> 

<p>This will download and install the schema I built, then deploy the code in the current directory to my personal StepZen GraphQL endpoint. It’ll also watch the directory for changes and automatically deploy them if I tweak any of the schema code, etc.</p>

<p>In addition to the above, the <code>start</code> command will open a browser window with the StepZen Schema Explorer that will allow you to test your API by exploring the queries and types available and querying the API running on StepZen.</p>

<p>If you want to start querying your new GraphQL endpoint directly from an application, read through the <a href="https://stepzen.com/docs/connecting-frontends/connecting-to-stepzen" title="Connecting to Your StepZen API">Connecting to Your StepZen API Guide</a> which shows some examples of how to connect/query your new GraphQL API.</p>

 Recap: How to Convert a REST API You Don’t Control to GraphQL 

<p>If you’re trying to find a way to use GraphQL on a REST API, here’s what you should do.</p>

<p>First, check StepZen’s list of <a href="https://github.com/steprz/stepzen-schemas" title="StepZen Publicly Supported Schemas">publicly supported schemas</a> to see if a schema already exists. This means you can use GraphQL to access the API of your choice without doing much.</p>

<p>If there isn’t a public schema available, go build your own! To do this:</p>

 
 Figure out what endpoints you need to use 
 Figuring out what data your endpoints take as input/output 
 Define a GraphQL type to reflect what your endpoints look like in GraphQL 
 Define a StepZen query to explain how the StepZen service can interact with the REST API 
 

<p>Once you have a schema, you can easily deploy it live to the StepZen service, which will give you a dedicated GraphQL endpoint/explorer you can query. And bam, you’re now able to use GraphQL to talk to any REST API, even ones you don’t own/control/etc!</p>

<p>デジタル庁からのワクチンパスポートに関するパブリックコメント要請が出ていたのでそれに返答しました。以下はそのコピーです。記録のために収録しておきます。</p>



<p>短期間の間に簡潔な仕様をおまとめいただきありがとうございます。<br>【海外渡航分】</p>



  海外渡航分に関しては、ICAOの規定が世界で通用するようになることが想定されますので、この採用には賛成です。  取得に関しては、OCR読み取りを想定されておられますが、実際にやってみるとパスポートのICカードも比較的簡単に読めます。しかもこの場合署名検証もでき、データとしての顔写真も取得可能です。これは実は利用者にとっても検証者にとっても使い勝手が良いと思っています。  



<p>【国内分】</p>



  国内分もSmartHealth Card (SHC)ベースということで国際規格に配慮していることが感じ取れ好感が持てました。  一方で、いくつか気になった点がありますので以下記載いたします。  



  ICAOから鍵取得ができる海外渡航分と違い、国内向けの記載の内容からは当該SHCの検証に使う鍵をどこから取得するのか、発行者の正当性をどのように確認するのかがわかりませんでした。米国のSHCの場合、この辺りはトラストフレームワークとして別途策定するというようなことであろうかと思います。したがって、日本での実装のための規格である本書でも、そこを明確化する必要があると思われます。この時に、署名者のリストと鍵は誰でも取得できるようにしていただければと思います  また、SHCではVerifiable Credential(VC)は使いますが、Verifiable Presentationが定義されていません。そのため、VCのメリットとしてよく言われる選択的属性提供が実現できません。結果、二次元バーコードに含まれる情報は常に全て店舗に渡ってしまいます。海外渡航用は全提示でも、そもそも国境検査における使い方が想定されるものなので問題は少ないのに対し、国内利用を想定する場合、提供対象が不特定多数になりますので望ましくありません。  加えて、顔写真など肉体と情報を結びつける情報がないため、ワクチン接種証明書を貸し出すことも可能です。結果、得られる果実は、1) ワクチン非接種者への社会的圧力としての機能に期待して実際の店舗等での接種の証明性には目を瞑る、2) 顔写真付きの身分証明書の提出を同時に求めることによって実効性を担保する、のどちらかになるように思われます。実際、欧州では国によっていずれかの対応になっているようです。後者は当然より大きな過剰提供問題を産んでいます。  この属性の過剰な提供問題は、米国のSHCにせよ、欧州のDigital Green Certificate (DGC) にせよ共通します。これは、それぞれの域内での雑多な事情を鑑みて、最大公約数的な規格にしたため、もっと言うと紙を前提としたためと考えられます。  しかし、日本においてはマイナンバーカードを必須としていることから、対象人口にはより効果的なソリューションも提供可能かと思います。これは、ICカードから券面記載事項である顔写真を抜き出し、これとワクチン情報を共に署名付きで保存することによって接種情報と肉体情報を結びつけるというものです。  店舗などの受け取り手には、状況に合わせてエンコーディングして渡す形になります。出し手、受け手共にネットワーク接続ができる場合には、ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 17や米国DHSで検討されているSelf-Issued OpenID Provider (SIOP)方式などが考えられるでしょうし（方式1）、受け手のみがネットワーク接続できる場合には、NFCないしQRコードでアクセス用のワンタイムコードと情報の格納先を引き渡し、そこから情報を取得することも考えられます（方式2）。最後のどちらもネットワークに繋がらない場合は仕方がありませんから、顔写真の検証は諦めるフォールバックも用意（方式3）しておけば、これらで大半は、{顔写真, ワクチン名, ワクチン有効開始日, 発行者, 発行日, 発行者署名}の提供だけで事足りるはずです。  これによって、氏名や生年月日やこれと組み合わせることでスーパークッキーとなり得るロット番号などの提供はしないですみます。（顔写真の提供は、本人がそこにいるのですからプライバシーインパクトは少ないと考えられます。なお、検証に使われるクライアントの認証と、正当なクライアントのリストは必要です。）  



<p>【接種情報取得API】</p>



  接種券番号と生年月日は確かに簡便ですが、やり方によってはこれは生年月日という人によってはセンシティブな情報を予約サイトに入力させることになるように思われます。そもそもこれだと認証も何もしていないことになりますし、この場合のセキュリティターゲットはどうなっているのでしょうか？場合によっては単に接種券番号だけでも目的は達せられるように思います。  もしこれが上記の二次元コード付き証明書を前提にしている場合は、上記の（方式1）のようなものを使うことによってより確実な情報提供が可能になると考えられます。  



<p>【全体に対して】今回の資料は大変簡潔であり感銘を受けましたが、一方では以下のことが不明であります。</p>



  ステークホルダーの一覧（衛生当局, 本人, 店舗等）  ステークホルダーの関心事  セキュリティ目標（本人以外が提示していたら検出できる、発行者を確認できる、改ざんを検知できる等）  プライバシー評価（そのサービスにおいて元々提供されていたもの以上の、ワクチン有効期間内か以外の個人を選別することに使える情報を追加で提供していないかなど）  



<p>こういったことの記載があれば、より適切なコメントができたと思います。最終版の発行に当たってはこうしたことも合わせてまとめていただければ幸甚です。</p>The post <a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2021/10/4917/">ワクチンパスポートパブリックコメント要請に対する返答</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.sakimura.org">@_Nat Zone</a>.

<p>A derived version of this article was published by the <a href="https://mobileecosystemforum.com/?p=103731&amp;preview=1&amp;_ppp=2bb3b8b890">Mobile Ecosystem Forum</a> on October 7, 2021.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you heard? Mobile is a big deal. The <a>majority of the world’s population carries a mobile device</a>, and there are <a>billions of connected devices</a> integrated throughout nearly every part of our daily life. Why does this insight matter? Putting it another way, mobile is the guiding light that leads enterprises down the path of commercial success. Commercial success requires The 3Cs: Connection, Communication, Commerce. One of the four core threads that connect these three stepping stones to commercial success is mobile; the other three are communications, content, and identity (aka personal information). Everyone in an enterprise must understand this, from the c-suite to the staffer. Why? Because today’s connected [mobile] individual is the point of everything along the customer journey. They are the point of discovery. The point of consideration. The point of sales/transaction. The point of engagement. The point of loyalty. Point of exit. And, at each point of engagement, mobile identity plays an irreplaceable role. We’re still early days in mobile identity, but the market is shaping and reshaping up quickly.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We see the mobile device as playing an almost irreplaceable role in terms of this linkage between a physical person in live space, or meatspace, you might say, and the digital realm.” – Cameron D’Ambrosi, Managing Director, Liminal 2021 (MEF PD&amp;I Working Group Guest Speaker, 2021)</p></blockquote>
 Mobile Identity: A Pillar for Commercial Success 
<p>Mobile identity sits at the heart of most commercial experiences. Identity can help organizations know, with varying levels of assurance, who is on the other end of a device (aka “know your customer”); likewise, soon but not just yet, it will enable individuals to know the enterprise too (aka “know the sender”). The ability for enterprises and the connected individual to know, with absolute assurance (aka deterministic identity) or with varying degrees of assurance (aka probabilistic identity), who the human or entity is on the other end of a device is extremely important. When we have identity assurance, we can have transparency in our transactions, communications, and relationships. This transparency fosters trust, which in turn leads to lasting connections, effective communications, and commerce. Moreover, this transparency will allow organizations to better serve people at every stage along the customer lifecycle (acquisition, consideration, conversation, adoption, loyalty, and offboarding), while simultaneously meeting their contractual, legal and regulatory obligations and protecting themselves and their stakeholders from fraud and other cybercrime. With the systematic foundation of trust that mobile identity enables, a world of abundance can lay out our feet.</p>
 Mobile Ecosystem Forum PD&amp;I Working Group 
<p>The <a>Mobile Ecosystem Forum</a> is a global big-tent trade body made of leading cross-sector organizations from around the world. Its mission is to help foster a healthy, responsible, mobile ecosystem, one where mobile can be used as an effective tool to bring social and commercial prosperity to every region, organization, and individual.</p>
<p>It is accomplishing this by engaging in a range of initiatives that generate insights, stimulate interaction, and make a positive impact. Much of the MEFs work happens at a grassroots level in its workgroups. For example, the <a>Personal Data &amp; Identity Working Group</a>, chaired by <a>Andrew Perkin-White</a>, focuses on mobile identity, the emerging personal data economy, the growth and application of people-centric regulations (e.g.&nbsp;<a>GDPR</a>, <a>CCPA</a>), the annual <a>MEF global trust study</a>, and more. The working group meets monthly to discuss and prioritize the effort across all its initiatives.</p>
 MEF PD&amp;I Working Group Guest Speaker 
<p>Periodically the working group invites a guest speaker to the monthly working group meeting. September 20, 2021, the group was fortunate enough to have <a>Cameron D’Ambrosi</a>, Managing Director, <a>Liminal</a>, join the meeting and share his thoughts on the state of the global identity infrastructure market ecosystem, both today and in the years to come.</p>
<p></p>
<p>During his prepared remarks, Cameron shared Liminal’s framework for evaluating identity infrastructure, the “Honeycomb.” He talked through the structure of the Honeycombs, how “anchor” identity solutions sit in the center, adjacent solutions fuse together to support use cases, and various other solutions specialize in the three types of data: deterministic, probabilistic, and self-managed, and their persistent or transitory states. He touched on a number of important topics, including,</p>
 
 The Liminal “Identity Honeycombs” framework 
 The three data types and their two stages 
 Digital ID: A How, not a What 
 Use Case examples 
 Strategies for navigating the landscape 
 Risk/reward management 
 Identity orchestration 
 And more

 An Invitation To Lead 
<p>The conversation with Cameron went on much longer than what you heard in the recording above. Why? Because much of the content is reserved for MEF members. If you’re a MEF member, I encourage you to log in to the MEF site and listen to the engaging Q&amp;A the working group members had with Cameron. If you’re not a member of the MEF, I encourage you to consider becoming one. Through the MEF, you can gain indispensable insight, interact with people, and make a difference that will benefit you and your company professionally and personally. An important thing to remember is that with membership in any community, including the MEF, like anything in life, is that you get out of it what you put in. The more you put into your relationship with the MEF and your fellow members, the more you can get out.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoyed this peek into the identity infrastructure marketplace. If you have thoughts and ideas as to where you think the marketplace is going, please do reach out. With the MEF, I’m working on a personal data &amp; identity market assessment report. I’d love to connect with you, see <a>MEF Personal Data &amp; Market Assessment Project (Schedule Interview and Share Insights)</a> to learn about the project, schedule an interview with me, or share your insights and resources.</p>

<a href="https://equalsdrummond.files.wordpress.com/2021/09/workona-wordmark-logo.png"></a>



<p>This is the first post I’ve made in 2 years—for the simple reason that my day job in SSI (the acronym for  <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/self-sovereign-identity">Self-Sovereign Identity</a>—click the link and read the book if you want to learn more) has been all-consuming (and showing no signs of abating).</p>



<p>So that explains why the last post was a rant about an experience with Lyft. It’s blood-boiling incidents like that which move me past the inertia to actually push out a new post.</p>



<p>This post is similar, but with a different ending. Here’s the story:</p>



<p>For at least four years I had been an inveterate user of The Great Suspender browser extension to help save memory due to the dozens of browser tabs I always had open in Chrome.</p>



<p>Then last March <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-kills-the-great-suspender-heres-what-you-should-do-next/">Google remotely blocked The Great Suspender</a> because it had been sold to a malware company.</p>



<p>A friend recommended I try <a href="https://workona.com/">Workona</a> because “it does much more than just suspend tabs—it will transform how you work with your browser”.</p>



<p>I did a little research and found several more such breathless endorsements, so I decided to give Workona a try.</p>



<p>It worked exactly as advertised. Within 30 minutes “my life in a browser” was changed forever. I was never going back. (I won’t go into how Workona works here—just check out the many <a href="https://www.g2.com/products/workona/reviews">rave reviews</a>.)</p>



<p>I was hooked enough that after a few weeks I tweeted out a love letter to Workona. </p>



<blockquote><p>.<a href="https://twitter.com/WorkonaHQ">@WorkonaHQ</a> It is rare that a browser utility stands out enough to merit a direct personal endorsement. But Workona is that good. I read so many reviews saying “it will change the way you use your browser” that I wondered if that could really be true. It was. Within minutes.</p></blockquote>



<p>When they replied to thank me, I responded.</p>



<blockquote><p>Honestly, you deserve it. Pretty soon I am going to start wondering, “Am I using Workona inside my browser or am I using my browser inside of Workona?”</p></blockquote>



 End of Act 1. 



<p>Act 2 began at about 6PM last Tuesday night when I clicked the “New Version – Upgrade” button that appears in Workona when there’s a new update. As usual, it refreshed in seconds. </p>



<p>Suddenly there was a new icon next to many of my Workona workspaces. I thought, “Cool, I wonder what new feature this is?” I clicked one to find out…</p>



<p>…and up popped a new dialog saying the workspace was now “locked” and the only way to unlock it was to buy a premium subscription (to that point Workona has been completely free).</p>



<p>I went ballistic. This fantastic new tool that had become an integral part of using my browser was suddenly blocking my own work in my own workspaces. I started clicking madly on the links provided in the upgrade dialog to find out who was responsible for this outrage. When I found a Workona contact form, I was almost shouting at the screen as I typed. A sampling:</p>



<blockquote><p>I am beyond upset that after working with&nbsp;Workona&nbsp;for several months now—whose functionality I love and which I have already recommended to several friends and tweeted about—you suddenly, with NO WARNING—lock all but 5 of my workspaces and hold me hostage to upgrade to free them OR require an SSO connection just to export my own data.</p><p>That, my good friends, is highly unethical business behavior.</p></blockquote>



<p>As you can tell, I was livid.</p>



<p>Thankfully, in the time it took me to go take a short walk and blow off steam, Alex Young at Workona sent me a reply via email.</p>



<blockquote><p>We’re sorry for the frustration this has caused. To start, you should be able to access all of your existing workspaces if you click the “Open workspace” button when you see the Upgrade modal. We are not locking any users out of their workspaces.&nbsp;</p><p>As for SSO, this is just needed to authenticate you for security purposes. You signed in via SSO, and as a result, that’s how we need to verify you.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>Alex was right. Despite what the upgrade dialog said, the “Open workspace” button that was greyed out (the universal signal that a button is not functional) did in fact work if you clicked it. So I wasn’t locked out of all-but-5 of my workspaces. They had just made it look that way.</p>



 End of Act 2. 



<p>Act 3 began a few hours later after I finished the work I was under deadline for and finally replied to Alex’s email:</p>



<blockquote><p>Alex, I appreciate the rapid response to my email. I have no idea if&nbsp;Workona&nbsp;has an automatic timer for when that “upgrade prompt” appears for a user or whether&nbsp;Workona&nbsp;just applied the policy today. (If the latter, I worry that you and the rest of the support staff have been flooded with complaints like mine today.)</p><p>Honestly—and feel free to share this within the company—I would have been much more supportive if the whole thing had been messaged differently. For example:</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>First, an advanced notice could have been made that explained the change in policy—there was NO WARNING whatsoever.</p><p>Second, the upgrade could have explained that you can still access the rest of your workspaces, you just have to go through the nag screen.</p><p>But the best way to handle it would have been to be upfront from the start and explain that the free version supports up to 5 workspaces and beyond that, you have to subscribe.</p></blockquote>



<p>That began a dialog in several more rounds of email with Alex where he acknowledged my criticisms and explained the rationale behind the upgrade policy. I particularly appreciated this one:</p>



<blockquote><p>We did send out an email to all of our users that the change would be happening – are you subscribed to receive our emails?&nbsp;</p><p>As for the rest of your feedback, I have passed this along to our product team.&nbsp;<br>Also – a little background regarding our current pricing: We have had to overcome immense technical challenges in the development of what we believe is the world’s best browser&nbsp;work&nbsp;manager.</p><p>Work&nbsp;has steadily moved from the desktop to the cloud, and many people do almost all of their most important&nbsp;work&nbsp;in the browser these days. For people that&nbsp;work&nbsp;in the browser, $7 is a good match to the value our app provides, and our pricing survey data backs this up. If you don’t&nbsp;work&nbsp;in the browser, or don’t feel you need a professional/reliable&nbsp;work&nbsp;management system, then we certainly understand that a different solution may be a better fit. We hope this helps you better understand why&nbsp;Workona&nbsp;has the premium pricing it does.</p></blockquote>



<p>It turns out that Workona had indeed sent out an advance notice (in email, not in their browser extension) of their change in policy in late August. I was on vacation, naturally, so I had missed it. </p>



<p>When I found it and read it—it was perfectly reasonable. And, although I thought $7/mo was a little on the high side for Workona (I use Zoom 6+ hours a day and it’s $15/mo), I really did feel that Workona represented the future of work in the browser.</p>



<p>I was going to wait until the next day to decide about upgrading. But before I went to bed, Alex had assuaged me enough—and most importantly restored my belief in the intent and integrity of Workona as a company—that I went ahead and subscribed for a year.</p>



<p>That was a pretty dramatic turnaround in a single evening. Kudos to Alex for his premium customer service. As I said to him in my final message:</p>



<blockquote><p>Alex, FYI, I subscribed for the 1 year plan. I want to personally thank you for talking me off the ledge. That’s the kind of customer service that makes or breaks a company IMHO.<br>I have high hopes for&nbsp;Workona. Keep being awesome.</p></blockquote>



 EPILOG 



<p>Today there was another upgrade message from Workona. When I clicked on it, a screen popped up (I had the foresight to take a screenshot) that offered an apology directly to Workona users right there in the browser. It contained a link to <a href="https://workona.com/blog/update-to-premium-plans/">this page on the Workona website</a>, the start of which I’ll excerpt here:</p>



 An Apology From Our CEO 



 



<p>September 24, 2021</p>



<blockquote><p>This week, we made some serious missteps while launching Workona’s premium plans. Please allow me to personally apologize and explain exactly what what we’ve done to make it right.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>We assumed that a detailed email sent a month ago announcing the changes was enough advance notice for users. Clearly, we were wrong. Your feedback has made it obvious that this was a major mistake. We should have announced this in the product, multiple times. We messed up, and we’re sorry.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Many users were caught off guard by the restrictions of the Free plan and wondered whether Workona was still a good option for them. This was exacerbated by the unclear language we used in our popup, which made them believe they were locked out of their workspaces. This was not the case (and not our intention), but that doesn’t change the damage it did to our users’ trust in Workona.</p></blockquote>



<p>There’s more. I encourage you to go to the Workona website and read the rest.</p>



<p>I took the time to write this post—my first one in two years—because when you screw up as a company—no matter how big or small—this is how you make it right. You bite the bullet, admit your mistake, and fix it, no matter how much work it takes.</p>

<p>A few months back, I wrote about some of the edge points of the verifiable credentials data model and briefly mentioned that the authorization capabilities for linked data (ZCAP-LD) data model was a useful technology for addressing these edges for building better distributed authorization systems. So what are the differences between these two data models and why am I advocating for the separation of concerns for the two of them? The three main points I want to highlight are the conceptual differences in usages and how the data models assist with enforcing those concepts. Then I’ll highlight the differences in the data models and finally, I’ll connect it all to show how these differences make a difference when building distributed authorization systems.</p>

<p>Conceptually verifiable credentials exist to make provenanced assertions. What does this mean though? Basically, a verifiable credential is a way to know who is making the claims, what the claims are, and who the claims are about and it’s done in a standard way so that all parties who issue, hold, and verify the provenance of the claims can do so without having to pre-coordinate their software design. On the other hand, authorization capabilities (ZCAPs) are designed around removing the concept of who the statements are about and rather building around the concept of an “invoker”. And it’s this difference that allows for an emergence of a different authorization system called object capabilities authorization systems. It’s my personal opinion that object-capability systems are better for most security models being designed today due to the simplicity for relying parties, but we’ll have to save that discussion for a later post.</p>

<p>What’s the difference between a subject and an invoker then? The difference is all in the practicality of pairing the claims with the entity. In the verifiable credential by tying all the claims to a subject there’s an inherent coupling of the claims to identity by the issuer. In technical terms, it’s being paired to an identifier which is the “credentialSubject.id” property which means that the claims that are made should only be extended to a single entity which is the subject of the claims. Anything which extends beyond the original claims made by the issuer is a new credential that needs to be evaluated independently of the original veracity of the claims made by the first issuer.</p>

<p>For example, let’s look at a proof of assets credential:</p>

   <code>{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
    {
        "@vocab": "https://bank.com/vocab#"
    }
  ],
  "id": "http://example.edu/credentials/1872",
  "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "ProofOfAssetsCredential"],
  "issuer": "did:web:bank.com:branch:id:565049",
  "issuanceDate": "2021-06-04T20:50:09Z",
  "credentialSubject": {
    "id": "did:example:bankAccountOwner",
    "TotalAccountValueInUSD": 4156.62,
  },
  "proof": {
    "type": "Ed25519Signature2020",
    "created": "2021-06-04T20:50:29Z",
    "verificationMethod": "did:example:bankAccountOwner#key-0",
    "proofPurpose": "authentication",
    "proofValue": "..."
  }
}
</code>   

<p>In this example, we can see that a bank branch is asserting on behalf of the bank that the bank account owner has a total account value with this bank of $4156.62. Now, let’s say the bank account owner has decided to chain their credential to their child so that their child can spend up to $50:</p>

   <code>{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
    {
        "@vocab": "https://bank.com/vocab#"
    }
  ],
  "id": "http://example.edu/credentials/1872",
  "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "ProofOfAssetsCredential"],
  "issuer": "did:example:bankAccountOwner",
  "issuanceDate": "2010-01-01T20:54:24Z",
  "credentialSubject": {
    "id": "did:example:child",
    "TotalAccountValueInUSD": 50.00,
  },
  "proof": {
    "type": "Ed25519Signature2020",
    "created": "2017-06-18T21:19:10Z",
    "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",
    "verificationMethod": "did:example:bankAccountOwner#key1",
    "proofValue": "..."
  }
}
</code>   

<p>and with this the child is now able to create a verifiable presentation like this:</p>

   <code>{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
   {

</code>   

<p>Let’s break down what is being asserted here, who the verifier needs to trust, and how the verifier would go about processing this verifiable presentation. From what we can see here, the bank is asserting that the bank account owner has a total account value of $4156.62, the bank account owner is asserting that their child is authorized to spend $50.00. Seems to make sense, right? Yeah, but the problem here is how is the verifier supposed to be able to trust that the bank account owner verified the child has that money as well, but why should the verifier trust the bank account owner? From their perspective, there are two problems here. First, they don’t trust any random person to make assertions about the amount of money in another person’s bank account. Second, the verifier is unable to correlate the relationship between the bank account owner and the child. From their perspective, the <code>credentialSubject.id</code> should be expected to be two opaque identifiers assuming all they’ve received is this verifiable presentation. So, the problem here is that the verifier is expected to infer knowledge about what is being stated here which presents risks in the business processes being encoded into software. Are they to assume that they’ll be paid by the bank account owner if the child doesn’t pay? The reality is the verifier shouldn’t rely upon this verifiable presentation because there’s no way to chain the trust and figure out the capabilities that the child should have based only on this verifiable presentation. Sure, they could manage some state about the relationships of the identifiers and coordinate with the bank to know that they’ll make sure someone pays, but that leads to bespoke authorization systems built specifically to the business logic which is unlikely to scale to the size of the internet today within a reasonable time frame. Coordination costs are incredibly expensive (look at how long it takes to make a standard) and managing state makes it nearly impossible to generalize the system outside the particular business process it’s designed for.</p>

<p>How do ZCAPs address this problem then? First off, it’s important to recognize that the model of capabilities lends itself to different statements being made. In the verifiable credential model, traditionally most people using them are making claims about “what the subject is”. Whereas with ZCAP-LD I’ve seen the focus of the statements on what the invoker can do. This slight shift combined with the change from a subject to an invoker changes the focus of the verifier to simplify what needs to be checked and makes the checks more explicit for what they’re checking.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at an example to see what I mean by this:</p>

   <code>{
  "@context": ["https://w3id.org/security/v2",
  {
      "@vocab": "https://bank.com/vocab#"
  }],

  // The identifier of this specific zcap object
  "id": "https://example.com/zcap/id/1",

  // Since this is the first delegated capability, the parentCapability
  // points to the target this capability will operate against
  // (in this case, a payment gateway)
  "parentCapability": "https://example.com/paymentGateway",
  
  // the bank account owner is only allowed to spend the amount in their account
  "caveat": [{
       "type": "MaxPayment",
        "maxPaymentValue": 4156.62
  }],

  // We are granting authority to any of bankAccountOwner's verification methods
  "invoker": "did:example:bankAccountOwner",
  
  // Finally we sign this object with cryptographic material from
  // Alyssa's Car's capabilityDelegation field, and using the
  // capabilityDelegation proofPurpose.
  "proof": {
    "type": "Ed25519Signature2018",
    "created": "2018-02-13T21:26:08Z",
    "capabilityChain": [

    ],
    "proofValue": "...",
    "proofPurpose": "capabilityDelegation",
    "verificationMethod": "did:web:bank.com:branch:id:565049#key1"
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Now for the bank account owner to authorize their child to spend $50.00 they need to produce the following delegated capability:</p>

   <code>{
    "@context": ["https://w3id.org/security/v2",
    {
        "@vocab": "https://bank.com/vocab#"
    }],

    // The identifier of this specific delegated zcap object
    "id": "https://example.com/zcap/id/2",

    // Pointing up the chain at the capability from
    // which the bank Account Owner was initially 
    // granted authority by their bank
    "parentCapability": "https://example.com/zcap/id/1",

    // Bank account owner adds a caveat:
    // child can spend a maximum of 50.00
    "caveat": [{
       "type": "MaxPayment",
        "maxPaymentValue": 50.00
    }],

    // bank account owner grants authority to any
    // verification method of their child's DID
    "invoker": "did:example:child",

    // Finally the bank account owner signs this 
    // object with the key she was granted the 
    // authority with
    "proof": {
        "type": "Ed25519Signature2020",
        "proofPurpose": "capabilityDelegation",
        "created": "2018-02-13T21:26:08Z",
        "creator": "did:example:bankAccountOwner#key1",
        "signatureValue": "..."
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Now for the ZCAP to be invoked by the child at the payment gateway to spend $50 they need to produce a ZCAP that looks like the following:</p>

   <code>{
    "@context": ["https://w3id.org/security/v2",
    {
        "@vocab": "https://bank.com/vocab#"
    }],

    // The identifier of this specific delegated zcap object
    "id": "https://example.com/zcap/id/3",

    // Pointing up the chain at the capability from
    // which the bank Account Owner was initially 
    // granted authority by their bank
    "parentCapability": "https://example.com/zcap/id/2",

    // bank account owner grants authority to any
    // verification method of their child's DID
    "invoker": "did:example:child",

    // the chain of capabilities from the trusted entity
    // making the intial authorization to the current 
    // capability being invoked 
    "capabilityChain": [{
        "@context": ["https://w3id.org/security/v2",
        {
            "@vocab": "https://bank.com/vocab#"
        }],
        "id": "https://example.com/zcap/id/1",
        "parentCapability": "https://example.com/paymentGateway",
        "caveat": [{
            "type": "MaxPayment",
                "maxPaymentValue": 4156.62
        }],
        "invoker": "did:example:bankAccountOwner",
        "proof": {
            "type": "Ed25519Signature2018",
            "created": "2018-02-13T21:26:08Z",
            "capabilityChain": [
            "https://example.com/paymentGateway"
            ],
            "proofValue": "...",
            "proofPurpose": "capabilityDelegation",
            "verificationMethod": "did:web:bank.com:branch:id:565049#key1"
        }
    },
    {
        "@context": ["https://w3id.org/security/v2",
        {
            "@vocab": "https://bank.com/vocab#"
        }],
        "id": "https://example.com/zcap/id/2",
        "parentCapability": "https://example.com/zcap/id/1",
        "caveat": [{
            "type": "MaxPayment",
            "maxPaymentValue": 50.00
        }],
        "invoker": "did:example:child",
        "proof": {
            "type": "Ed25519Signature2020",
            "proofPurpose": "capabilityDelegation",
            "created": "2018-02-13T21:26:08Z",
            "creator": "did:example:bankAccountOwner#key1",
            "signatureValue": "..."
        }
    }],
    "proof": {
        "type": "Ed25519Signature2020",
        "proofPurpose": "capabilityInvocation",
        "created": "2018-02-13T21:27:09Z",
        "creator": "did:example:child#key1",
        "signatureValue": "..."
    }
}
</code>   

<p>To verify this ZCAP, the payment gateway verifier needs to do the following:</p>

 
   verify the proof of the original capability 
   verify the original invoker is authorized to delegate the original capability on behalf of the payment gateway 
   verify the original capability meets or exceeds the authorities necessary to perform the request 
   verify the proof that the bank account owner delegated the original capability to the invoker 
   verify the caveats allow the delegated capability to still meet or exceed the authorities necessary to perform the request 
   verify the proof in the capability invoked by the child 
 

<p>So this is a bit simpler for the payment gateway verifying the chain and makes it explicit what’s being delegated through the different parties. The question of the relationship between the different parties has now been eliminated which means that the payment gateway can operate in a stateless method. Additionally, there’s less coordination between the original delegator and the payment gateway verifier. In the object capabilities model, the authorization semantics are all predetermined by what is possible to be authorized which keeps the claims tightly scoped to the purpose of the capabilities being invoked.</p>

<p>The difference here is that the basis of all authority stems from the verifier rather than building off the statements that existed before the verifier did who may not have designed the original claims for authorization systems. And this key difference is what allows for the simplicity of the verifier system to exist. It moves the model back to having the sole authority set by the verifier rather than the verifier having to adapt and potentially misinterpret the original veracity and the chained veracity of the claims.</p>

<p>So what are the drawbacks of the object-capability paradigm and more specifically of the ZCAP-LD data model? Well first and foremost, ZCAPs are fit for building object-capability authorization models and are unlikely to be applicable beyond that intended scope. For me, that’s alright because I like the idea of designing technology to do one thing well. Especially when dealing with security and access control. Whereas the verifiable credentials data model allows for generic statements to be made which are far more useful for verifiable data ecosystems to emerge. Additionally, it’s worth mentioning that the ZCAPs data model is a relatively immature draft report at the credentials community group whereas the verifiable credentials data model has a much more stable recommendation having completed the process to become an international standard recommended by the W3C. This means there’s far more likely to be interoperability between verifiable credential processors than there would be between ZCAPs.</p>

<p>Why put the time and effort into ZCAP-LD when we’ve already got VCs? Simply put because security is hard and trying to push square pegs into round holes oftentimes leads to bugs that are elevated to mission-critical authentication/authorization bypass vulnerabilities. By designing around a fit-for-purpose data model with a well-defined problem being solved it allows for us to be much more precise about where we believe extensibility is important versus where normative statements should be made to simplify the processing of the data models. By extension, this leads to a simpler security model and likely a much more robust design with fewer vulnerabilities. And that’s the reason that I’m a fan of ZCAP-LD.</p>

It is where everyone fights for survival; I cannot get what I want, others have nothing and work is just meaningless. It is in between these two states of euphoria and despair that we spend our time.&nbsp; Never reaching utopia but somehow constantly individual’s individual’s feeling one step closer to dystopia.&nbsp; In this state, we have to decide how to allocate the limited resources we have to be able to change the situation (for the better.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Whilst hard to accept, we actually don’t have the data, model or ability to allocate resources for better outcomes as we live in a complex system. In our ecosystem and economy, our actions have consequences that we cannot see. In the USA, they reintroduced wolves and have found that Wolves play a crucial role in keeping ecosystems healthy. They help keep deer and elk populations in check, benefiting individual’s many other plant and animal species. The carcasses of their prey also help to redistribute nutrients and provide food for other wildlife species, like grizzly bears and scavengers. Scientists are just beginning to fully understand the positive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripple_effect">ripple effects</a> that wolves have on ecosystems. The removal of the wolves was forecast to create a more vibrant and healthy ecosystem, but it turns out it collapses without them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>The Ripple Effect is when an initial disturbance to a system propagates outward to disturb an increasingly more significant portion of the system, like ripples expanding across the water when an object is dropped into it.&nbsp; The ripple effect is often used colloquially to mean a multiplier in macroeconomics. For example, an individual's reduction in spending reduces the incomes of others and their ability to spend. Unions negotiating for a pay rise drives prosperity for everyone. In sociology, the ripple effect can be observed in how social interactions can affect situations not directly related to the initial interaction and in charitable activities where information can be disseminated and passed from community to community to broaden its impact.&nbsp; The concept has been applied in computer science within the field of software metrics as a complexity measure.</p><p>Living at peak paradox and making decisions at this central point creates ripples. However, we find it easy to predict the positive consequences of ripples we want to see in the direction of the peak purpose we are aiming for on the Peak Paradox model.&nbsp; We are blinded to the adverse effects because we believe we have understood the risks and concluded this is the best action, given where we are and our resources.&nbsp; Equally, we find it near impossible to see any good or bad consequences that can occur in other directions.&nbsp; The point here is that we cannot see how a ripple in a different direction will come back (forward) and change the situation we forecast.&nbsp; This is the complexity of modelling dependent systems that we do not understand, yet believing we have a risk model that does.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The purpose of the Peak Paradox model is to shine a light on the other views, other perspectives, other consequences, other risks - not to change the decision, but to clarify how our decision will affect others and we are affected by theirs.&nbsp; With the same thinking, others acting with their own agency will optimise for a different peak and, in doing so, create ripples in our tank, highlighting why resilience has become such an important but widely misunderstood topic.&nbsp; We must agree on what we are trying to be resilient for, as it is often hidden.&nbsp;</p><p>The article on <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/post/plotting-how-to-make-better-decisions">how to make better decisions</a> using the Peak Pardox framework suggests that we have to move from the Peak Paradox if we can clarify what we are optimising for and bring the team together.&nbsp; However, the further we become aligned to a Purpose, whilst the easier the decision, the more unified the culture, the less resilient we become to others ripples.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Balancing simplicity of decision making, with the allocation of resources and understanding risk and consequences is the optimisation model a board now has to wrestle with. Decision making has never been more challenging.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p></p><br><br>

 I enjoyed reading The Code of Capital by Katharina Pistor.  I liked this book because it provides what seems like a rare perspective that is required to reveal the DNA of capitalism rather than the more common unintended obfuscation from books that are lacking.

<p>I enjoyed reading <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691178974/the-code-of-capital">The Code of Capital</a> by <a href="https://www.law.columbia.edu/faculty/katharina-pistor">Katharina Pistor</a>.  I liked this book because it provides what seems like a rare perspective that is required to reveal the DNA of capitalism rather than the more common unintended obfuscation from books that are lacking.  A benefit is that emerging technologies related to assets can be considered in a more coherent way and we can see that issues which seem new often resemble those of the past.</p>

<p>For instance, Pistor asks the genesis question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How should the initial allocation of property rights in the digital world be achieved, and who is in charge?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While my mind somehow retrieves <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWiwYApseDk">Otisburg</a>, Pistor more helpfully notes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These are the same questions the commoners disputed with the landlords and the settler challenged the First Peoples about, as discussed in Chapter 2.  Ultimately, these issues were resolved by establishing legal priority rights, backed by the coercive powers of the state.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Law relating to capital is often created in private law offices but is dependent on the state for the legal modules used to assemble these legal codes.  The most important of these modules are contract law, property rights, collateral law, trust, corporate and bankruptcy law.</p>

<p>These legal codes transform an asset (object, claim, skill or idea) into capital.  Because the legal coding gives the asset attributes of priority, durability, universality and convertability, the asset can create wealth for its holder while surviving challenging economic circumstances and externalizing associated risks to others.  The book goes into detail as the legal modules are applied to new assets over time.</p>

<p>Following the evolution of these legal codes helped me understand things that had been a mystery to me.  I wish I could have read a book like this a long time ago.</p>

<p>Since <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/intro-to-dids-for-people-5ebe620b5a15">the beginning</a> of our journey here at MATTR, decentralization and digital identity have been central to our approach to building products. As part of this, we’ve supported Decentralized Identifiers (or <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/docs/platform/core/dids/overview">DIDs</a>) since the <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/introducing-the-mattr-platform-91db4925c773">earliest launch of our platform</a>. We’ve also considered how we might give you more options to <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/did-extensibility-on-the-mattr-platform-14c73c7a798e">expand the utility</a> of these identities over&nbsp;time.</p> An important milestone <p>The W3C working group responsible for Decentralized Identifiers <a href="https://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/9179">recently published</a> the DID v1.0 specification under “Proposed Recommendation” status. This is a significant milestone as DIDs approach global standardization with the pending approval of the W3C Advisory Committee.</p><p>DIDs are maturing, but so is the environment and context in which they were originally designed. With a complex ecosystem consisting of dozens of different methodologies and new ones emerging on a regular basis, it’s important to balance the potential of this decentralized approach with a realistic approach for defining the real utility and value of each <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#methods">DID method</a>. For example, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2021/NOTE-did-rubric-20210826/">DID Method Rubric</a> provides a good frame of reference for comparing different approaches.</p><p>Different types of DIDs can be registered and anchored using unique rules specific to the set of infrastructure where they’re stored. Since DIDs provide provenance for keys which are controlled by DID owners, the rules and systems that govern each kind of DID method have a significant impact on the trust and maintenance model for these identifiers. This is the key thing to remember when choosing a DID method that makes sense for your&nbsp;needs.</p> Our supported DID&nbsp;methods <p>In MATTR VII, by supporting a variety of DID methods — deterministic or key-based DIDs, domain-based DIDs, and ledger-based DIDs — we are able to provide tools which can be customized to fit the needs of individual people and organizations.</p>  Key-based DIDs — Largely static, easy to create, and locally controlled. This makes them a natural choice for applications where there’s a need to manage connections and interactions with users directly.  DIDs anchored to web domains — These have a different trust model, where control over the domain can bootstrap a connection to a DID. This makes a lot of sense for organizations with existing domain names that already transact and do business online, and can extend their brand and reputation to the domain of&nbsp;DIDs.  Ledger-based DIDs — These offer a distributed system of public key infrastructure which is not centrally managed or controlled by a single party. While ledgers differ in their governance and consensus models, they ultimately provide a backbone for anchoring digital addresses in a way which allows them to be discovered and used by other parties. This can be a useful feature where a persistent identifier is needed, such as in online communication and collaboration.  <p>There is no single DID method or type of DID (which at the moment) should be universally applied to every situation. However, by using the strengths of each approach we can allow for a diverse ecosystem of digital identifiers enabling connections between complex networks of people, organizations and machines.</p><p>To date, we’ve provided support for three main DID methods in our platform: <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-key/">DID Key</a>, <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/">DID Web</a>, and <a href="https://sovrin-foundation.github.io/sovrin/spec/did-method-spec-template.html">DID Sovrin</a>. These align with three of the central types of infrastructure outlined&nbsp;above.</p> Introducing DID&nbsp;ION <p>We’re proud to announce that as of today we’ve added support for <a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/">DID ION</a>, a DID method which is anchored to IPFS and Bitcoin. We’ve <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/sidetree-protocol-reaches-v1-9b565cf92db3">supported the development of the Sidetree protocol</a> that underpins DID ION for some time as it has matured in collaboration with working group members at the Decentralized Identity Foundation.</p><p>With contributions from organizations such as Microsoft, Transmute, and SecureKey, <a href="https://identity.foundation/sidetree/spec/">Sidetree</a> and DID ION have emerged as a scalable and enterprise-ready solution for anchoring DIDs. The <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/decoding-the-sidetree-protocol-18d8bfa39257">core idea</a> behind the Sidetree protocol is to create decentralized identifiers that can run on any distributed ledger system. DID ION is an implementation of that protocol which backs onto the Bitcoin blockchain, one of the largest and most used public ledger networks in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Sidetree possesses some unique advantages not readily present in other DID methods, such as low cost, high throughput, and built-in portability of the identifier. This provides a number of benefits to people and organizations, especially in supporting a large volume of different kinds of connections with the ability to manage and rotate keys as needed. We have added end-to-end capabilities for creating and resolving DIDs on the ION network across our platform and wallet products.</p><p>Although DID ION is just one implementation of the Sidetree protocol, we see promise in other DID methods using Sidetree and will consider adding support for these over time as and when it makes sense. We’ll also continue to develop Sidetree in collaboration with the global standards community to ensure that this protocol and the ION Network have sustainable futures for a long time to&nbsp;come.</p><p>At the same time, the community around DID Sovrin is developing a new kind of interoperability by designing a <a href="https://hackmd.io/@icZC4epNSnqBbYE0hJYseA/S1eUS2BQw">DID method</a> that can work for vast networks of Indy ledgers, rather than focusing on the Sovrin-specific method that’s been used to date. As DID Sovrin gets phased out of adoption, we’re simultaneously deprecating standard support for DID Sovrin within MATTR VII. We’ll be phasing this out shortly with upcoming announcements for customers building on our existing platform.</p><p>If you’ve got any use cases that utilize DID Sovrin or want to discuss extensibility options, please reach out to us on any of our social channels or at info@mattr.global and we’ll be happy to work with&nbsp;you.</p> Looking ahead <p>We believe this a big step forward in providing a better set of choices when it comes to digital identity for our customers. From the start, we have designed our platform with flexibility and extensibility in mind, and will continue to support different DID methods as the market&nbsp;evolves.</p><p>We look forward to seeing how these new tools can be used to solve problems in the real world and will keep working to identify better ways to encourage responsible use of digital identity on the&nbsp;web.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/adding-did-ion-to-mattr-vii-d56bdb7a2fde">Adding DID ION to MATTR VII</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Over the past several years, the world of messaging has morphed in front of our very eyes. There are now more than six messaging channel categories, including text (inc. SMS, MMS, RCS), email, social media, chatbots (i.e. for support and conversational commerce), proximity alerts, and more than a dozen over-the-top apps (WhatsApp, WeChat, Viber, Apple Business Chat, Line, iMessage, Facebook Messenger, Pinterest, YouTube, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, and more). What does this mean for organizations? Well, for some they may think it means that their organization has a variety of channels to choose from to reach the people they serve (aka consumers, shoppers, patients, investors, etc.). On the surface, this is true. But what it really means is that organizations must start developing their multi-channel messaging muscles so that they can reach individuals not on the organization’s preferred time and medium of communication, but on the individual’s preferred time and medium of communication.</p>
<p>To effectively manage a messaging program, the most important thing to realize is that messaging channels are NOT all created equal. Every channel has a different audience profile, audience expectations, norms, message lengths, message formats, ways to send and receive messages, and methods for reporting across the engagement continuum (e.g., transaction through relationship). Messaging is an ecosystem all of its own that must be nurtured if you want to find success.</p>
 Need I say more? Of course, I do! 
<blockquote><p>“The customer is everywhere and nowhere.” Todd Harrison, SVP of Digital at Skechers&nbsp;(Harrison, 2021)</p></blockquote>
<p>You may find yourself with prospects and customers and few ways to reach them? You may find yourself with tired campaigns that simply do not perform the way you want them to? You may find yourself losing touch with your most valuable asset, your first-party database. You may ask yourself, how did I get here? You may ask yourself, which channel should I use to achieve the best results?</p>
<p>Todd is right, “the customer is everywhere, and nowhere.” The way to address this problem is to put your customer at the heart of your business. What does this mean? It means you must learn to collect and listen to their preferences? To interact and engage them, not just barrage them with mono-directional messages that basically say, “I have an idea, why don’t you buy more stuff from us?” People want to be respected, heard, and served. You need to treat them as the hero of your story. To make this happen, you need to understand them. You need to focus on building out an end-to-end communication strategy, which includes building a preference-based opt-in database, often referred to as a customer data platform (CDP). Depending on your needs you’ll need dedicated messaging platforms (e.g. SMS, 10DLC, Email, etc.) or possibly a multichannel communication platform as a service (CPasS) to manage real-time messaging across all channels. Moreover, you’ll need a content strategy. And soon, to meet the expectations of those you serve, you’ll need to build the capability to deliver predictive, personalized, contextually aware content and offers, with real-time feedback loops so that you can listen to customers and respond to them when they reply or initiate a conversation with you. In the near future, we will find that messaging has become the cornerstone of the vast majority of businesses’ engagement strategies, but we have a long way to go as only six to ten percent of companies are actively nurturing and running commercial messaging programs today (Ruppert, 2021).</p>
<p>Yes, you can succeed with the tried and true tactics, but for how long? The marketplace and consumer sentiments are changing, and you must change with them, or you’ll be left behind.</p>
<blockquote><p>“By 2030, society will no longer tolerate a business model that relies on mass transactions of increasingly sensitive personal data: a different system will be in place.”&nbsp;(Data 2030, 2020)</p></blockquote>
<p>We’ll cover more on the bigger picture in future articles, let’s get back to messaging.</p>
 What it takes to run a successful messaging program 
<p>The key to a successful messaging program is to start simple and build from there.</p>
<p>You should not be frightened by the sea of mobile messaging opportunities. Embrace them, and take them one step at a time. Take it from us, with the simplest of messaging programs you have the potential to see material success. For example, we are aware of a retail company that, in 12 months after launching a text-based SMS program sprinkled with the occasional MMS message, acquired 700,000 subscribers and is now generating over $1.4M in monthly sales.</p>

 Where do you start? 
<p>SMS, or text messaging, is the most straightforward, omnipresent, and ubiquitous messaging channel that you can use to engage people anywhere in the world. And, best of all, it is proven.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephanieburns/2019/09/06/9-clever-ways-to-use-text-messaging-in-your-business/?sh=2aa3edb62951">Open rates in SMS are often 95% and higher</a>.</p>
<p>Text messaging is not just about driving sales, and although this is the end-game, it is about being of service to your audience throughout every stage of the relationship they have with you. Text messaging provides at the most basic level more engagement not just as a utility but as a consumer relationship tool – securing interactions, driving pre and post-sales engagements, gathering feedback through surveys, and fostering loyalty and support. You can, and should, use it across every stage of the purchase funnel: discovery, awareness, consideration, conversation, onboarding and adoption, loyalty, support, and offboarding.</p>
<p>NOTE: Keep an eye out for 10DLC, a new messaging standard the kicked off in June 2021. Our next article will be on this.</p>
 But What if? 
<p>Yes, text messaging, aka SMS, is ubiquitous, but what should you do when you need to grow beyond what texting has to offer? Remember, “the medium is the message” (Marshall McLuhan, 1964). Text messaging is not the right channel for every engagement.</p>
<p>What if you needed to reach and engage people in China, Brazil, Germany, or Australia? What if your product was best suited to be explained via a picture or a video? What are the best channels to reach these consumers? Text is not always the answer!</p>

<p>Facebook Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp, and other messaging channels are making a considerable play at being complementary messaging options for consumers and, in some cases, the primary channel. Geographic location is the main driver for these channel decisions as well as the use case. But the numbers don’t lie in regards to the global user base of over 2 billion consumers.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/258749/most-popular-global-mobile-messenger-apps/">OTT Messaging Leaders.&nbsp;</a></p>
  
 Where Should You Start? 
<p>Sounds like a lot? Sounds complicated? It’s really not if you think about these few items and take them one at a time in your messaging and engagement roadmap.</p>
<p>Here are a few things for you to consider that will help mold your direction. First, start with a few pillars: Message type (use-case, transactional, marketing, support…), Geolocation(s), Staffing, and Existing Partners. Consider,</p>
 
 Are you currently offering text transactional or marketing messaging? 
 Which markets and countries are you looking to reach? 
 How much is your social media advertising budget? 
 Are you considering messaging for support (don’t just think SMS, think OTT)? 
 Do you have internal staff to manage your messaging programs? 
 Are you currently using a Marketing Automation platform? 
 Are you working with external guides and mentors (Remember:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6841097885103341568/">coaches and mentors are required if you want to be an expert</a>&nbsp;)? 
 
 Enter Personal Data &amp; Identity 
<p>It is critical for you to remember that all effective commerce starts with a meaningful connection and relevant and consistent communication. The path to relevance is through data, particularly personal data, in fact, a new asset class that you need to wield with precision.</p>
 The Bottomline 
<p>For the majority SMS (text) will be your first entry into the messaging space. But, depending on how you answered the questions above, the odds are you will be a perfect candidate to implement one of the other messaging channels too. Your next step is to evaluate your current programs and roadmap of “Needs” vs ’Wants” and map out the use cases, i.e., the experience you want to offer your customers, prior to finding a good technology and solutions partner.</p>
<p>Your “Needs’ may have to do with driving revenue, loyalty sign-ups, gathering preference data, support efficiencies, personalization, and could be as simple as mapping out your KPI’s and creating efficiencies of your current messaging strategy. Day, time, type of message, MMS vs.&nbsp;SMS, frequency, and more have a say in the results in your program. Remember, planning before tactics!</p>
<p>Messaging has proven to be the most effective tool, especially when used in a thoughtful and meaningful experience, for people-centric engagement programs. But in the age of the connected individual, the bottom line is that it is a necessity, not a nice to have.</p>
<p>There is a lot to navigate, but this is nothing like any other part of your business. You can do it. Create a roadmap. Find your partners. Take one step at a time!</p>

<p>現地（ミュンヘン）時間13日午後7時半、European Identity and Cloud Conference 2021で GAIN – Global Assured Identity Network を発表しました。これは、すべての参加者が身元確認済みであるオーバレイネットワークです。</p>



<p>使用したスライドは以下からご覧になっていただけます。</p>



<p>ホワイトペーパー自体は、<a href="https://gainforum.org/">https://gainforum.org/</a> からダンロードしていただけます。</p>



<p>参加にあたっての問い合わせは、DigitalTrust _at_ iif.com (International Institute of Finance内事務局。_at_ を @ で置き換えてお使いください）にお願いいたします。また、POC参加に関するお問い合わせは donna _at_ oidf.org にお願いします</p>



 GAINとは 



<p>詳細は以下の英文ブログに譲りますが、その下にDeepLによる機械翻訳も参考までに載せておきます。（検証していないので間違いや割愛等結構あるかもしれません。が、なんとなく概要を見るのには良いでしょう。原本は英語ですので、詳しく見るにはそちらを御覧ください。）</p>



 
<blockquote><a href="https://nat.sakimura.org/2021/09/14/announcing-gain/">Announcing GAIN: Global Assured Identity Network</a></blockquote>
 



<p>インターネットの始まりには、信頼がありました。誰もが参加している組織に知られており、誰もが責任（Accountability）を負わされることを知っていたのです。</p>



<p>しかし、90年代にインターネットが商業的に利用できるようになると、信頼は失われました。参加者の大半が匿名になり、責任を問われないと認識するようになったのです。その結果、多くの犯罪者やバッドアクターがネットワーク上で活躍するようになりました。インターネットのワイルド・ワイルド・ウエストの時代が到来したのです。</p>



<p>それ以来、状況を改善し、信頼を回復するために多くの努力が払われてきました。しかし、あまり効果はありませんでした。金融犯罪は、人への影響が計り知れない不正行為から生まれ、世界経済に年間GDPの最大5％もの損失を与えています。マネーロンダリング防止やテロ資金対策に莫大な費用がかけられていますが、今のところ効果はありません。金融システム内の1,000ドルの「違法な資金」に対して、コンプライアンスに100ドルが費やされていますが、傍受されるのはわずか1ドル。わずか0.1％です。</p>



<p>このコインの裏側には金融包摂の問題もあります。</p>



<p>多くの人々は、口座開設に関わる本人確認コストのために商業的にとりこむことができず、経済的に排除されています。</p>



<p>匿名で行動できることは、原理的にはプライバシーの面で大きなメリットがあります。しかし、私たちが実現しているのは、個人データが危険にさらされ、善良な行為者が悪質な行為者に容易に追跡されるという状況です。いわば熟練した悪質な行為者のためのプライバシーであり、われわれ「それ以外の人」のためのプライバシーはありません。</p>



<p>30年の時間とコストをかけたにもかかわらず、なぜ私たちはこれらを阻止することに成功しないのでしょうか。</p>



<p>それは、アイデンティティとアカウンタビリティという根本的な問題に取り組んでこなかったからです。</p>



<p>私たちが必要としているのは、エコシステム内のすべての参加者のアカウンタビリティを再確立することです。</p>



<p>このようなエコシステムは、比較可能性と相互承認の原則に基づいて相互に接続することができ、最終的にはサイバーワールドの人口の大部分をカバーする説明責任のあるエコシステムのネットワークを形成することができます。</p>



<p>そのようなエコシステムのひとつが、今日、私たちが提案するものです。GAIN（Global Assured Identity Network）です。</p>



<p>GAINは、アカウンタビリティのある参加者のみで構成されるインターネット上のオーバーレイネットワークです。すべての参加者は、主に銀行やその他の規制対象組織からなるホスティング組織で口座を開設する際に、規制を満たすための身元確認を受けています。これらの高保証属性は、エンドユーザーの指示に基づいて アイデンティティ情報提供者から依拠当事者(RP)に渡される アイデンティティ情報の基礎として使用されます。</p>



<p>エンド・ユーザーは、自己申告ではなく、信頼できるエンティティによって証明された年齢などの属性を証明できるようになります。これは非常に強力です。</p>



<p>例えば、「私は18歳以上です」ということを、「私を信じてください」と言うだけでなく、銀行の証明書を使って証明することができます。</p>



<p>これは、プライバシーの観点からも非常に良いことです。</p>



<p>自己申告の場合、情報の受け手は自分の言っていることが信じられないので、通常、それを証明するために運転免許証などの身分証明書を提示しなければなりません。この時点で、彼女は年齢よりもはるかに多くの属性を開示していることになります。</p>



<p>このような能力は、以前に行われた 身元確認にかかっています。身元確認は非常にコストのかかるプロセスです。</p>



<p>この目的のためだけにそれを行おうとすると、法外な費用がかかる可能性があります。</p>



<p>本業のために身元確認を行う必要がある銀行やその他の規制機関は、この点で有利です。これは、ある巨大なオンライン小売業者が、ホリデーシーズンにしか必要とされない冗長機能をより有効に活用するために、クラウドコンピューティングサービスを提供し始めたようなものです。他のホスティングベンダーは太刀打ちできませんでした。</p>



<p>アイデンティティ情報提供者によってIDが証明されたからといって、個人がGAINで匿名で行動できないわけではありません。個人は、マーチャントやネットワークの他の参加者に対して、匿名または偽名で行動することができます。実際、個人の属性の開示は最小限にとどめるのが普通である。ただし、不正行為を行った場合には、正当な手続きに基づいて個人を追跡し、責任を追及することができるようになっています。指定されたオープナーと呼ばれるエンティティは、取引の履歴を開き、その時の人物を指し示すことができる。</p>



<p>ネットワーク上のすべてのビジネスエンティティは、ホスティング組織でのビジネスアカウントの作成と維持の一環として審査されており、匿名のままでいることはできません。彼らには説明責任があります。その結果、消費者は安心して取引を行うことができ、依拠当事者にとってはビジネスの拡大につながります。すべての善良なアクターが利益を得ることができるのです。</p>



<p>この効果はグローバルなものです。マーチャントは、一度登録して契約するだけで、世界中のネットワーク参加者にアクセスできるようになります。</p>



<p>個人は、エコシステム内のすべての依拠当事者が存在し、説明責任を果たしているという安心感を持ってアクセスすることができます。確かに悪質な業者はまだ存在するでしょうが、その範囲はより限定されたものになります。エコシステムは、現在のインターネットよりもはるかに安全になります。参加者がアクションを起こすのに十分なものになるでしょう。信頼が再び確立されます。</p>



<p>完璧なプロセスはありません。GAINにおいても、悪質な行為者は確実に存在しますが、それは標準ではなく例外となるため、問題ははるかに扱いやすくなります。行動を起こすには「十分」でしょう。</p>



<p>つまり、信頼が再確立されたのです。</p>

<p>Monday will be my first day as community lead for Steampipe, a young open source project that normalizes APIs by way of Postgres foreign data wrappers. The project’s taglines are select * from cloud and query like it’s 1992; the <a href="https://steampipe.io/">steampipe.io home page</a> nicely illustrates these ideas. </p>
<p></p>
<p>I’ve been thinking about API normalization for a long time. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html">original proposal</a> for the World Wide Web says:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Databases</p>
<p>A generic tool could perhaps be made to allow any database which uses a commercial DBMS to be displayed as a hypertext view.
</p></blockquote>
<p>We ended up with standard ways for talking to databases — ODBC, JDBC — but not for expressing them on the web. </p>
<p>When I was at Microsoft I was bullish on <a href="https://www.odata.org/">OData</a>, an outgrowth of Pablo Castro’s wonderful <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2007/07/03/a-conversation-with-pablo-castro-about-astorias-restful-data-services/">Project Astoria</a>. Part of the promise was that every database-backed website could automatically offer basic API access that wouldn’t require API wrappers for everybody’s favorite programming language. The API was hypertext; a person could navigate it using links and search. Programs wrapped around that API could be useful, but meaningful interaction with data would be possible without them. </p>
<p>(For a great example of what that can feel like, jump into the middle of one of Simon Willison’s datasettes, for example <a href="https://san-francisco.datasettes.com/food-trucks/Mobile_Food_Facility_Permit?Applicant=1">san-francisco.datasettes.com</a>, and start clicking clicking around.)</p>
<p>Back then I wrote a couple of posts on this topic[<a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2009/11/18/odata-is-grease-to-cut-data-friction/">1</a>, <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2010/01/29/odata-for-collaborative-sense-making/">2</a>]. Many years later OData still hasn’t taken the world by storm. I still think it’s a great idea and would love to see it, or something like it, catch on more broadly. Meanwhile Steampipe takes a different approach. Given a proliferation of APIs and programming aids for them, let’s help by providing a unifying abstraction: SQL.</p>
<p>I’ve done a deep dive into the SQL world over the past few years. The <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/07/21/a-virtuous-cycle-for-analytics/">first post</a> in a series I’ve been writing on my adventures with Postgres is what connected me to Steampipe and its sponsor (my new employer) <a href="https://turbot.com/">Turbot</a>. When you install Steampipe it brings Postgres along for the ride. Imagine what you could do with data flowing into Postgres from many different APIs and filling up tables you can view, query, join, and expose to tools and systems that talk to Postgres. Well, it’s going to be my job to help imagine, and explain, what’s possible in that scenario. </p>
<p>Meanwhile I need to give some thought to my Twitter tag line: patron saint of trailing edge technologies. It’s funny and it’s true. At BYTE I explored how software based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_News_Transfer_Protocol">Net News Transfer Protocol</a> enabled my team to <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/practical-internet-groupware/1565925378">do things</a> that we use Slack for today. At Microsoft I built a system for <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/elmcity-project-faq/">community-scale calendaring</a> based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar">iCalendar</a>. When I picked up NNTP and iCalendar they were already on the trailing edge.  Yet they were, and especially in the case of iCalendar still are, capable of doing much more than is commonly understood. </p>
<p>Then of course came web annotation. Although Hypothesis recently shepherded it to <a href="https://web.hypothes.is/blog/annotation-is-now-a-web-standard/">W3C standardization</a> it goes all the way back to the <a href="http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q2/0416.html">Mosaic browser</a> and is exactly the kind of generative tech that fires my imagination. With Hypothesis now well established in education, I hope others will continue to explore the breadth of what’s possible when every document workflow that needs to can readily connect people, activities, and data to selections in documents. If that’s of interest, here are some <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/09/03/notes-for-an-annotation-sdk/">signposts</a> pointing to scenarios I’ve envisioned and prototyped.</p>
<p>And now it’s SQL. For a long time I set it aside in favor of object, XML, and NoSQL stores. Coming back to it, by way of Postgres, has shown me that:</p>
<p>– Modern SQL is more valuable as a programming language than is commonly understood</p>
<p>– So is Postgres as a programming environment</p>
<p>The tagline query like it’s 1992 seems very on-brand for me. But maybe I should let go of the trailing-edge moniker. Nostalgia isn’t the best way to motivate fresh energy. Maybe query like it’s 2022 sets a better tone? In any case I’m very much looking forward to this next phase.</p>

<p>R0ml Lefkowitz’s <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/08/21/postgres-functional-style/">The Image of Postgres</a> evokes the Smalltalk experience: reach deeply into a running system, make small changes, see immediate results. There isn’t yet a fullblown IDE for the style of Postgres-based development I describe in this series, though I can envision a VSCode extension that would provide one. But there is certainly a REPL (read-eval-print loop), it’s called psql, and it delivers the kind of immediacy that all REPLs do. In our case there’s also Metabase; it offers a complementary REPL that enhances its power as a <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/09/05/metabase-as-a-lightweight-app-server/">lightweight app server</a>. </p>
<p>In the <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/repl/introduction">Clojure docs</a> it says:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The Clojure REPL gives the programmer an interactive development experience. When developing new functionality, it enables her to build programs first by performing small tasks manually, as if she were the computer, then gradually make them more and more automated, until the desired functionality is fully programmed. When debugging, the REPL makes the execution of her programs feel tangible: it enables the programmer to rapidly reproduce the problem, observe its symptoms closely, then improvise experiments to rapidly narrow down the cause of the bug and iterate towards a fix.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I feel the same way about the Python REPL, the browser’s REPL, the Metabase REPL, and now also the Postgres REPL. Every function and every materialized view in the analytics system begins as a snippet of code pasted into the psql console (or Metabase). Iteration yields successive results instantly, and those results reflect live data. In <a href="https://blog.bracha.org/exemplarDemo/exemplar2021.html">How is a Programmer Like a Pathologist</a> Gilad Bracha wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>
A live program is dynamic; it changes over time; it is animated. A program is alive when it’s running. When you work on a program in a text editor, it is dead.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Tudor Girba amplified the point in a tweet. </p>
<p></p>
<p>In a database-backed system there’s no more direct way to interact with live data than to do so in the database. The Postgres REPL is, of course, a very sharp tool. Here are some ways to handle it carefully.</p>
 Find the right balance for tracking incremental change 
<p>In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/08/26/working-in-a-hybrid-metabase-postgres-code-base/">Working in a hybrid Metabase / Postgres code base</a> I described how version-controlled files — for Postgres functions and views, and for Metabase questions — repose in GitHub and drive a concordance of docs. I sometimes write code snippets directly in psql or Metabase, but mainly compose in a “repository” (telling word!) where those snippets are “dead” artifacts in a text editor. They come to life when pasted into psql.</p>
<p>A knock on Smalltalk was that it didn’t play nicely with version control. If you focus on the REPL aspect, you could say the same of Python or JavaScript. In any such case there’s a balance to be struck between iterating at the speed of thought and tracking incremental change. Working solo I’ve been inclined toward a fairly granular commit history. In a team context I’d want to leave a chunkier history but still record the ongoing narrative somewhere.</p>
 Make it easy to understand the scope and effects of changes 
<p>The doc concordance has been the main way I visualize interdependent Postgres functions, Postgres views, and Metabase questions. In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/08/28/working-with-interdependent-postgres-functions-and-materialized-views/">Working with interdependent Postgres functions and materialized views</a> I mentioned Laurenz Albe’s <a href="https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/tracking-view-dependencies-in-postgresql/">Tracking View Dependencies in Postgres</a>. I’ve adapted the view dependency tracker he develops there, and adapted related work from others to track function dependencies. </p>
<p>This tooling is still a work in progress, though. The concordance doesn’t yet include Postgres types, for example, nor the tables that are upstream from materialized views. My hypothetical VSCode extension would know about all the artifacts and react immediately when things change.</p>
 Make it easy to find and discard unwanted artifacts 
<p>Given a function or view named foo, I’ll often write and test a foo2 before transplanting changes back into foo. Because foo may often depend on bar and call baz I wind up also with bar2 and baz2. These artifacts hang around in Postgres until you delete them, which I try to do as I go along. </p>
<p>If foo2 is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization">memoized</a> function (see <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/08/19/postgres-set-returning-functions-that-self-memoize-as-materialized-views/">this episode</a>), it can be necessary to delete the set of views that it’s going to recreate. I find these with a query.</p>
 select 
  'drop materialized view ' || matviewname || ';' as drop_stmt
from pg_matviews 
where matviewname ~* {{ pattern }}
 
<p>That pattern might be question_and_answer_summary_for_group to find all views based on that function, or _6djxg2yk to find all views for a group, or even [^_]{8,8}$ to find all views made by memoized functions. </p>
<p>I haven’t yet automated the discovery or removal of stale artifacts and references to them. That’s another nice-to-have for the hypothetical IDE. </p>
 The Image of Postgres 
<p>I’ll give R0ml the last word on this topic.</p>
<blockquote><p>
This is the BYTE magazine cover from August of 1981. In the 70s and the 80s, programming languages had this sort of unique perspective that’s completely lost to history. The way it worked: a programming environment was a virtual machine image, it was a complete copy of your entire virtual machine memory and that was called the image. And then you loaded that up and it had all your functions and your data in it, and then you ran that for a while until you were sort of done and then you saved it out. And this wasn’t just Smalltalk, Lisp worked that way, APL worked that way, it was kind of like Docker only it wasn’t a separate thing because everything worked that way and so you didn’t worry very much about persistence because it was implied. If you had a programming environment it saved everything that you were doing in the programming environment, you didn’t have to separate that part out. A programming environment was a place where you kept all your data and business logic forever.</p>
<p>So then Postgres is kind of like Smalltalk only different.</p>
<p>What’s the difference? Well we took the UI out of Smalltalk and put it in the browser. The rest of it is the same, so really Postgres is an application delivery platform, just like we had back in the 80s.
</p></blockquote>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/07/21/a-virtuous-cycle-for-analytics/">A virtuous cycle for analytics</a> I said this about Metabase:</p>
<blockquote><p>
It’s all nicely RESTful. Interactive elements that can parameterize queries, like search boxes and date pickers, map to URLs. Queries can emit URLs in order to compose themselves with other queries. I came to see this system as a kind of lightweight application server in which to incubate an analytics capability that could later be expressed more richly.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s explore that idea in more detail. Consider this query that finds groups created in the last week.</p>
 with group_create_days as (
  select
     to_char(created, 'YYYY-MM-DD') as day
  from "group"
  where created &gt; now() - interval '1 week'
)
select 
  day,
  count(*)
from group_create_days
group by day 
order by day desc 
 
<p>A Metabase user can edit the query and change the interval to, say, 1 month, but there’s a nicer way to enable that. Terms in double squigglies are Metabase variables. When you type {{interval}} in the query editor, the Variables pane appears. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Here I’m defining the variable’s type as text and providing the default value 1 week. The query sent to Postgres will be the same as above. Note that this won’t work if you omit ::interval. Postgres complains: “ERROR: operator does not exist: timestamp with time zone – character varying.” That’s because Metabase doesn’t support variables of type interval as required for date subtraction. But if you cast the variable to type interval it’ll work.</p>
<p>That’s an improvement. A user of this Metabase question can now type 2 months or 1 year to vary the interval. But while Postgres’ interval syntax is fairly intuitive, this approach still requires people to make an intuitive leap. So here’s a version that eliminates the guessing. </p>
<p></p>
<p>The variable type is now Field Filter; the filtered field is the created column of the group table; the widget type is Relative Date; the default is Last Month. Choosing other intervals is now a point-and-click operation. It’s less flexible — 3 weeks is no longer an option — but friendlier.</p>
<p>Metabase commendably provides URLs that capture these choices. The default in this case is METABASE_SERVER/question/1060?interval=lastmonth. For the Last Year option it becomes interval=lastyear. </p>
<p>Because all Metabase questions that use variables work this way, the notion of Metabase as rudimentary app server expands to sets of interlinked questions. In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/08/26/working-in-a-hybrid-metabase-postgres-code-base/">Working in a hybrid Metabase / Postgres code base</a> I showed the following example.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A Metabase question, #600, runs a query that selects columns from the view top_20_annotated_domains_last_week. It interpolates one of those columns, domain, into an URL that invokes Metabase question #985 and passes the domain as a parameter to that question. In the results for question #600, each row contains a link to a question that reports details about groups that annotated pages at that row’s domain.</p>
<p>This is really powerful stuff. Even without all the advanced capabilities I’ve been discussing in this series — pl/python functions, materialized views — you can do a lot more with the Metabase / Postgres combo than you might think.</p>
<p>For example, here’s a interesting idiom I’ve discovered. It’s often useful to interpolate a Metabase variable into a WHERE clause.</p>
 select * 
from dashboard_users
where email = {{ email }} 
 
<p>You can make that into a fuzzy search using the case-insensitive regex-match operator ~*.</p>
 select * 
from dashboard_users
where email ~* {{ email }}
 
<p>That’ll find a single address regardless of case; you can also find all records matching, say, ucsc.edu. But it requires the user to type some value into the input box. Ideally this query won’t require any input. If none is given, it lists all addresses in the table. If there is input it does a fuzzy match on that input. Here’s a recipe for doing that. Tell Metabase that {{ email }} a required variable, and set its default to any. Then, in the query, do this:</p>
 select * 
from dashboard_users
where email ~*
  case 
    when {{ email }} = 'any' then ''
    else {{ email}}
  end
 
<p>In the default case the matching operator binds to the empty string, so it matches everything and the query returns all rows. For any other input the operator binds to a value that drives a fuzzy search.</p>
<p>This is all very nice, you may think, but even the simplest app server can write to the database as well as read from it, and Metabase can’t. It’s ultimately just a tool that you point at a data warehouse to SELECT data for display in tables and charts. You can’t INSERT or UPDATE or ALTER or DELETE or CALL anything. </p>
<p>Well, it turns out that you can. Here’s a Metabase question that adds a user to the table.</p>
<p>select add_dashboard_user( {{email}} )</p>
<p>How can this possibly work? If add_dashboard_user were a Postgres procedure you could CALL it from psql, but in this context you can only SELECT.</p>
<p>We’ve seen the solution in <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/08/19/postgres-set-returning-functions-that-self-memoize-as-materialized-views/">Postgres set-returning functions that self-memoize as materialized views</a>. A Postgres function written in pl/python can import and use a Python function from a plpython_helpers module. That helper function can invoke psql to CALL a procedure. So this is possible.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We’ve used Metabase for years. It provides a basic, general-purpose UX that’s deeply woven into the fabric of the company. Until recently we thought of it as a read-only system for analytics, so a lot of data management happens in spreadsheets that don’t connect to the data warehouse. It hadn’t occurred to me to leverage that same basic UX for data management too, and that’s going to be a game-changer. I always thought of Metabase as a lightweight app server. With some help from Postgres it turns out to be a more capable one than I thought.</p>

  <p>Prompted by this exchange on Twitter:</p>
<blockquote><p>Functionality attached to the context-defining data object. Instead of an “app” silo. Now here’s a thought. :-)</p>— Johannes Ernst (@Johannes_Ernst) <a href="https://twitter.com/Johannes_Ernst/status/1434044253835980803?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 4, 2021</a></blockquote> 
<p>Let me unpack this a bit. Let’s say that I’d like to send a message to
some guy, let’s call him Tom for this example.</p>
<p>The messaging app vendors go like: “Oh yes, we’ll make it super-easy for
him (Johannes) to send a message to Tom, so we give him an extra short
handle (say @tom) so he doesn’t need to type much, and also add a ‘reply’
button to previous messages so he won’t even have to type that.”</p>
<p>Which is myopic, because it completely misunderstands or ignores the context
of the user. The user doesn’t think that way, at least most of the time.</p>
<p>As a user, I think the pattern is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I need to tell (person) about (news) related to
(common context), how do I best do that (i.e. which app)?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Three concepts and a sub-concept:</p>
 
 
<p>Who do I want to tell. In Joshua’s example: the person(s) I’m about to meet
with.</p>
 
 
<p>What’s the news I want to tell them. Here it is “I am running late”.</p>
 
 But this news only makes sense in the common context of “we agreed to meet
today”. If the receiver doesn’t have that context, they will receive
my message and it will be pointless and bewildering to them. 
 
 
 
<p>What’s the best way of conveying that news. It might be a text, a phone call,
or pretty much anything. This item is the least important in this entire
scenario, as long as the receiver gets the message.</p>
 
 
<p>So thre are two primary “entry” points for this scenario:</p>
 
 
<p>It starts with a person. The user thinks “Tom, I need to tell Tom that I’ll
be late”, and the frantically tries to find a way of contacting them while
hurring in the subway or driving really fast. (We have all been there.)</p>
 
 
<p>It starts with the shared context object. The user looks at the calendar and
thinks “Oh darn, this meeting, it’s now, I’ll be late, I need to tell them”.
(They might not even remember who exactly will be in the meeting, but then likely
the calender event has that info.)</p>
 
 
<p>The entry point is almost never: “how convenient, I have all people I’m about
to meet with in the current window of the messaging app, they all know what
whatever I’m going to type into that window next is about the meeting, and
I can just simply say that I’ll be late.”</p>
<p>So … if we were to put the user, and their experience, at the center of
messaging, messaging wouldn’t be an app. (Well, it might also be an app,
but mostly it wouldn’t.)</p>
<p>Instead, the messaging would be a “system service” attached to the context
objects in which I’d like to message. In Joshua’s example that is:</p>
 
 
<p>the person I’m about to meet with (but this only works if there is a
single person; if there are a dozen this does not work).</p>
 
 
<p>the shared context about which I am conveying the news: here, the
(hopefully shared) calendar event. Joshua’s original point.</p>
 
 
<p>Now in my experience, this is just an example for a more general pattern. For example:</p>
 
 
<p>meeting notes. In which meeting any meeting notes were taken is
of course supremely important. Which is why most meeting minutes start
with a title, a date/time and a list of attendees. Instead, they should be
attached to the calendar event, just like the message thread. (Yes,
including collaborative editing.)</p>
<p>And by “attached” I don’t mean: there’s a URL somewhere in the calendar
dialog form that leads to a Google Doc. No, I mean that the calendar can
show them, and insert the to-do-items from the meeting, and future meetings
from that document, and the other way around: that when you look at
the meeting notes, I can see the calendar event, and find out it is
a biweekly meeting, and the notes for the other meetings are over there.</p>
 
 
<p>projects. Software development is the worst offender, as far as I
know. If you and I and half a dozen other people work on a project to
implement functionality X, that is our primary shared context. All
communication and data creation should occur in that context. But instead
we have our code in Github, our bugs in Confluence, our APIs … test
cases … screen mockups … video calls … chats … in a gazillion
different places, and one of these days I’m sure somebody is going to
prove that half of software budgets in many places are consumed by context
switching between tools that blissfully ignore that the user thinks not
like a vendor does. (And the other half by trying to make the so-called
“integrations” between services work.)</p>
 
 
<p>There are many more examples. (In a previous life, I ran around with the
concept of “situational computing” – which takes context-aware computing
to something much more dynamic and extreme; needless to say it was decades
before its time. But now with AR/VR-stuff coming, it will probably become
part of the mainstream soon.)</p>
<p>The 100 dollar question is of course: if this is the right thing for users, why aren’t apps doing that?</p>
<p>Joshua brought up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDoc">OpenDoc</a> in a subsequent
post. Yep, there is a similarity here, and apps don’t do this kind of thing for
the same reason OpenDoc failed. (It didn’t fail because it was slow as molasses
and Steve Jobs hated it.)</p>
<p>OpenDoc failed because it would have disintermediated big and powerful
companies such as Adobe, who would have had to sell 100 little OpenDoc
components, instead of one gigantic monolith containing those 100 components
as a take-it-or-leave-it package at “enterprise” pricing. No adoption by
Adobe, Adobe feeling Apple proactively attacked their business model, it
would have killed Apple right afterwards.</p>
<p>But having OpenDoc would have sooo much better for users. We would have gotten
much more innovation, and yes, lower prices. But software vendors, like all
businesses, primarily do what is right for them, not their customers.</p>
<p>Which is why we get <a href="https://indieweb.org/silo">silos</a> everwhere we look.</p>
<p>If we wanted to change that situation, about OpenDoc-like things, or
messaging attached, in context, to things like calendar events, we have
to change the economic situation in which the important vendors find
themselves.</p>
<p>Plus of course the entire technology stack, because if all you know is
how to ship an <code>int main(argv, argc)</code> on your operating system, something
componentized and pluggable and user-centric and context-centric is never
able to emerge, even if you want to.</p>
<p>(*) The title is meant to be sarcastically, in case you weren’t sure.</p>

Others include tools to <a href="https://web.hypothes.is/blog/annotation-powered-questionnaires/">evaluate credibility signals</a>, or <a href="https://misinfocon.com/lets-use-the-annotated-web-to-coordinate-the-struggle-against-fake-news-1627ff4919a3">review claims</a>, in news stories. </p>
<p>As I worked through these and other scenarios, I accreted a set of tools for enabling any annotation-aware interaction in any document-oriented workflow. I’ve wanted to package these as a coherent software development kit, that hasn’t happened yet, but here are some of the ingredients that belong in such an SDK. </p>
 Creating an annotation from a selection in a document 
<p>Two core operations lie at the heart of any annotation system: creating a note that will bind to a selection in a document, and binding (anchoring) that note to its place in the document. A tool that creates an annotation reacts to a selection in a document by forming one or more selectors that describe the selection.</p>
<p>The most important selector is TextQuoteSelector. If I visit <a href="http://www.example.com">http://www.example.com</a> and select the phrase “illustrative examples” and then use Hypothesis to annotate that selection, the payload sent from the client to the server includes this construct.</p>
 {
  "type": "TextQuoteSelector", 
  "exact": "illustrative examples", 
  "prefix": "n\n    This domain is for use in ", 
  "suffix": " in documents. You may use this\n"
}
 
<p>The Hypothesis client formerly used an NPM module, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/dom-anchor-text-quote">dom-anchor-text-quote</a>, to derive that info from a selection. It no longer uses that module, and the equivalent code that it does use isn’t separately available. But annotations created using TextQuoteSelectors formed by dom-anchor-text-quote interoperate with those created using the Hypothesis client, and I don’t expect that will change since Hypothesis needs to remain backwards-compatible with itself.</p>
<p>You’ll find something like TextQuoteSelector in any annotation system. It’s formally defined by the W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/#text-quote-selector">here</a>. In the vast majority of cases this is all you need to describe the selection to which an annotation should anchor. </p>
<p>There are, however, cases where TextQuoteSelector won’t suffice. Consider a document that repeats the same passage three times. Given a short selection in the first of those passages, how can a system know that an annotation should anchor to that one, and not the second or third? Another selector, TextPositionSelector (<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/dom-anchor-text-position">https://www.npmjs.com/package/dom-anchor-text-position</a>), enables a system to know which passage contains the selection.</p>
 {
  "type": "TextPositionSelector", 
  "start": 51
  "end": 72, 
}
 
<p>It records the start and end of the selection in the visible text of an HTML document. Here’s the HTML source of that web page.</p>
 &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Example Domain&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This domain is for use in illustrative examples in documents. You may use this
    domain in literature without prior coordination or asking for permission.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.iana.org/domains/example"&gt;More information...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
 
<p>Here is the visible text to which the TextQuoteSelector refers.</p>
<blockquote><p>
\n\n    Example Domain\n    This domain is for use in illustrative examples in documents. You may use this\n    domain in literature without prior coordination or asking for permission.\n    More information…\n\n\n\n
</p></blockquote>
<p>The positions recorded by a TextQuoteSelector can change for a couple of reasons. If the document is altered, it’s obvious that an annotation’s start and stop numbers might change. Less obviously that can happen even if the document’s text isn’t altered. A news website, for example, may inject different kinds of advertising-related text content from one page load to the next. In that case the positions for two consecutive Hypothesis annotations made on the same selection can differ. So while TextPositionSelector can resolve ambiguity, and provide hints to an annotation system about where to look for matches, the foundation is ultimately TextQuoteSelector.</p>
<p>If you try the first example in the README at <a href="https://github.com/judell/TextQuoteAndPosition">https://github.com/judell/TextQuoteAndPosition</a>, you can form your own TextQuoteSelector and TextPositionSelector from a selection in a web page. That repo exists only as a wrapper around the set of modules — dom-anchor-text-quote, dom-anchor-text-position, and wrap-range-text — needed to create and anchor annotations.</p>
<p>Building on these ingredients, <a href="https://github.com/judell/HelloWorldAnnotated">HelloWorldAnnotated</a> illustrates a common pattern.</p>
 
  Given a selection in a page, form the selectors needed to post an annotation that targets the selection.
   Lead a user through an interaction that influences the content of that annotation.
   Post the annotation.
  
<p>Here is an example of such an interaction. It’s a content-labeling scenario in which a user rates the emotional affect of a selection. This is the kind of thing that can be done with the stock Hypothesis client, but awkwardly because users must reliably add tags like WeakNegative or StrongPositive to represent their ratings. The app prompts for those tags to ensure consistent use of them. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Although the annotation is created by a standalone app, the Hypothesis client can anchor it, display it, and even edit it. </p>
<p></p>
<p>And the Hypothesis service can search for sets of annotations that match the tags WeakNegative or StrongPositive. </p>
<p>There’s powerful synergy at work here. If your annotation scenario requires controlled tags, or a prescribed workflow, you might want to adapt the Hypothesis client to do those things. But it can be easier to create a standalone app that does exactly what you need, while producing annotations that interoperate with the Hypothesis system.</p>
 Anchoring an annotation to its place in a document 
<p>Using this same set of modules, a tool or system can retrieve an annotation from a web service and anchor it to a document in the place where it belongs. You can try the second example in the README at <a href="https://github.com/judell/TextQuoteAndPosition">https://github.com/judell/TextQuoteAndPosition</a> to see how this works.</p>
<p>For a real-world demonstration of this technique, see <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2017/05/05/weaving-the-annotated-web/#sitc">Science in the Classroom</a>. It’s a project sponsored by The American Association for the Advancement of Science. Graduate students annotate research papers selected from the Science family of journals so that younger students can learn about the terminology, methods, and outcomes of scientific research.</p>
<p>Pre-Hypothesis, annotations on these papers were displayed using Learning Lens, a viewer that color-codes them by category. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Nothing about Learning Lens changed when Hypothesis came into the picture, it just provided a better way to record the annotations. Originally that was done as it’s often done in the absence of a formal way to describe annotation targets, by passing notes like: “highlight the word ‘proximodistal’ in the first paragraph of the abstract, and attach this note to it.” This kind of thing happens a lot, and wherever it does there’s an opportunity to adopt a more rigorous approach. Nowadays at Science in the Classroom the annotators use Hypothesis to describe where notes should anchor, as well as what they should say. When an annotated page loads it searches Hypothesis for annotations that target the page, and inserts them using the same format that’s always been used to drive the Learning Lens. Tags assigned by annotators align with Learning Lens categories. The search looks only for notes from designated annotators, so nothing unwanted will appear. </p>
 An annotation-powered survey 
<p>The <a href="https://credibilitycoalition.org/">Credibility Coalition</a> is “a research community that fosters collaborative approaches to understanding the veracity, quality and credibility of online information.” We worked with them on a project to test a set of <a href="https://credweb.org/reviewed-signals-20200224/">signals</a> that bear on the credibility of news stories. Examples of such signals include: </p>
 
 Title Representativeness (Does the title of an article accurately reflect its content?)
  Sources (Does the article cite sources?)
  Acknowledgement of uncertainty (Does the author acknowledge uncertainty, or the possibility things might be otherwise?)
  
<p>Volunteers were asked these questions for each of a set of news stories. Many of the questions were yes/no or multiple choice and could have been handled by any survey tool. But some were different. What does “acknowledgement of uncertainty” look like? You know it when you see it, and you can point to examples. But how can a survey tool solicit answers that refer to selections in documents, and record their locations and contexts? </p>
<p>The answer was to create a <a href="https://web.hypothes.is/blog/annotation-powered-questionnaires/">survey tool</a> that enabled respondents to answer such questions by highlighting one or more selections. Like the HelloWorldAnnotated example above, this was a bespoke client that guided the user through a prescribed workflow. In this case, that workflow was more complex. And because it was defined in a <a href="https://github.com/judell/AnnotationPoweredSurvey/blob/master/questions.js">declarative way</a>, the same app can be used for any survey that requires people to provide answers that refer to selections in web documents.</p>
 A JavaScript wrapper for the Hypothesis API 
<p>The HelloWorldAnnotated example uses functions from a library, <a href="https://github.com/judell/hlib">hlib</a>, to post an annotation to the Hypothesis service. That library includes functions for searching and posting annotations using the Hypothesis API. It also includes support for interaction patterns common to annotation apps, most of which occur in <a href="https://github.com/judell/facet">facet</a>, a standalone tool that searches, displays, and exports sets of annotations. Supported interactions include:</p>
<p>– Authenticating with an API token</p>
<p>– Creating a picklist of groups accessible to the authenticated user</p>
<p>– Assembling and displaying conversation threads</p>
<p>– Parsing annotations</p>
<p>– Editing annotations</p>
<p>– Editing tags</p>
<p>In addition to facet, other tools based on this library include <a href="https://github.com/judell/CopyAnnotations">CopyAnnotations</a> and <a href="https://github.com/judell/TagRename">TagRename</a></p>
 A Python wrapper for the Hypothesis API 
<p>If you’re working in Python, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/hypothesis-api/">hypothesis-api</a> is an alternative API wrapper that supports searching for, posting, and parsing annotations. </p>
 Notifications 
<p>If you’re a publisher who embeds Hypothesis on your site, you can use a <a href="https://web.hypothes.is/blog/new-search-capability/">wildcard search</a> to find annotations. But it would be helpful to be notified when annotations are posted. <a href="https://github.com/judell/h_notify">h_notify</a> is a tool that uses the Hypothesis API to watch for annotations on individual or wildcard URLs, or from particular users, or in a specified group, or with a specified tag. </p>
<p>When an h_notify-based watcher finds notes in any of these ways, it can send alerts to a Slack channel, or to an email address, or add items to an RSS feed.</p>
<p>At Hypothesis we mainly rely on the Slack option. In this example, user nirgendheim highlighted the word “interacting” in a page on the Hypothesis website. </p>
<p></p>
<p>The watcher sent this notice to our #website channel in Slack. </p>
<p></p>
<p>A member of the support team (Hypothesis handle mdiroberts) saw it there and responded to nirgendheim as shown above. How did nirgendheim know that mdiroberts had responded? The core Hypothesis system sends you an email when somebody replies to one of your notes. h_notify is for bulk monitoring and alerting.</p>
<p><a></a></p>
 A tiny Hypothesis server 
<p>People sometimes ask about connecting the Hypothesis client to an alternate server in order to retain complete control over their data. It’s doable, you can follow the instructions <a href="https://h.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developing/install/">here</a> to build and run your own server, and some people and organizations do that. Depending on need, though, that can entail more effort, and more moving parts, than may be warranted.</p>
<p>Suppose for example you’re part of a team of investigative journalists annotating web pages for a controversial story, or a team of analysts sharing confidential notes on web-based financial reports. The documents you’re annotating are public, but the notes you’re taking in a Hypothesis private group are so sensitive that you’d rather not keep them in the Hypothesis service. You’d ideally like to spin up a minimal server for that purpose: small, simple, and easy to manage within your own infrastructure.</p>
<p>Here’s a <a href="https://github.com/judell/MinimalHypothesisServer">proof of concept</a>. This tiny server clocks in just 145 lines of Python with very few dependencies. It uses Python’s batteries-include SQLite module for annotation storage. The web framework is Pyramid only because that’s what I’m familiar with, but could as easily be Flask, the ultra-light framework typically used for this sort of thing. </p>
<p>A <a href="https://github.com/judell/MinimalHypothesisServer/blob/main/service.py">tiny app</a> wrapped around those ingredients is all you need to receive JSON payloads from a Hypothesis client, and return JSON payloads when the client searches for annotations to anchor to a page.</p>
<p>The service is dockerized and easy to deploy. To test it I used the <a href="https://fly.io/">fly.io</a> <a href="https://fly.io/docs/speedrun/">speedrun</a> to create an instance at <a href="https://summer-feather-9970.fly.dev">https://summer-feather-9970.fly.dev</a>. Then I made the handful of small tweaks to the Hypothesis client shown in <a href="https://github.com/judell/MinimalHypothesisServer/blob/main/client-patches.txt">client-patches.txt</a>. My method for doing that, typical for quick proofs of concept that vary the Hypothesis client in some small way, goes like this:</p>
 
  Clone the Hypothesis client.
   Edit gulpfile.js to say const IS_PRODUCTION_BUILD = false. This turns off minification so it’s possible to read and debug the client code.
   Follow the instructions to <a href="https://h.readthedocs.io/projects/client/en/latest/developers/developing/#running-the-client-from-the-browser-extension">run the client from a browser extension</a>. After establishing a link between the client repo and browser-extension repo, as per those instructions, use this build command — make build SETTINGS_FILE=settings/chrome-prod.json — to create a browser extension that authenticates to the Hypothesis production service.
   In a Chromium browser (e.g. Chrome or Edge or Brave) use chrome://extensions, click Load unpacked, and point to the browser-extension/build directory where you built the extension.
  
<p>This is the easiest way to create a Hypothesis client in which to try quick experiments. There are tons of source files in the repos, but just a handful of bundles and loose files in the built extension. You can run the extension, search and poke around in those bundles, set breakpoints, make changes, and see immediate results. </p>
<p>In this case I only made the changes shown in client-patches.txt:</p>
 
  In options/index.html I added an input box to name an alternate server.
   In options/options.js I sync that value to the cloud and also to the browser’s localStorage.
   In the extension bundle I check localStorage for an alternate server and, if present, modify the API request used by the extension to show the number of notes found for a page.
   In the sidebar bundle I check localStorage for an alternate server and, if present, modify the API requests used to search for, create, update, and delete annotations.
  
<p>I don’t recommend this cowboy approach for anything real. If I actually wanted to use this tweaked client I’d create branches of the client and the browser-extension, and transfer the changes into the source files where they belong. If I wanted to share it with a close-knit team I’d zip up the extension so colleagues could unzip and sideload it. If I wanted to share more broadly I could upload the extension to the Chrome web store. I’ve done all these things, and have found that it’s feasible — without forking Hypothesis — to maintain branches that maintain small but strategic changes like this one. But when I’m aiming for a quick proof of concept, I’m happy to be a cowboy.</p>
<p>In any event, here’s the proof. With the tiny server deployed to summer-feather-9970.fly.dev, I poked that address into the tweaked client. </p>
<p></p>
<p>And sure enough, I could search for, create, reply to, update, and delete annotations using that 145-line SQLite-backed server.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The client still authenticates to Hypothesis in the usual way, and behaves normally unless you specify an alternate server. In that case, the server knows nothing about Hypothesis private groups. The client sees it as the Hypothesis public layer, but it’s really the moral equivalent of a private group. Others will see it only if they’re running the same tweaked extension and pointing to the same server. You could probably go quite far with SQLite but, of course, it’s easy to see how you’d swap it out for a more robust database like Postgres.</p>
 Signposts 
<p>I think of these examples as signposts pointing to a coherent SDK for weaving annotation into any document workflow. They show that it’s feasible to decouple and recombine the core operations: creating an annotation based on a selection in a document, and anchoring an annotation to its place in a document. Why decouple? Reasons are as diverse as the document workflows we engage in. The stock Hypothesis system beautifully supports a wide range of scenarios. Sometimes it’s helpful to replace or augment Hypothesis with a custom app that provides a guided experience for annotators and/or an alternative display for readers. The annotation SDK I envision will make it straightforward for developers to build solutions that leverage the full spectrum of possibility.</p>

    <a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo/archive">This link gives you access to all the articles and archives</a> for &lt;/Hello CDO&gt; <p>“Prevention or Correction” is something society has wrestled with for a very long time. This article focuses on why our experience of “prevention or correction” ideas frames the CDO’s responsibilities and explores a linkage to a company’s approach to data.</p><p></p> <br>Almost irrespective of where you reside, we live with police, penal, and political systems that cannot fully agree on preventing or correcting.  It is not that we disagree with the “why”; is it the “how” that divides us! I am a child of an age when lefthandedness was still seen as something to correct, so we have made some progress.   <br>A fundamental issue is that prevention is the best thinking; but if you prevent it, it does not occur.  We are then left with the dilemma, “did you prevent it, or was it not going to occur anyway?” The finance team now ask, “Have we wasted resources on something that would not have happened?”<br><br>When something we don’t like does occur, we jump into action as we can correct it.  We prioritise, allocate resources and measure them.  We (humanity) appear to prefer a problem we can solve (touch, feel, see) and can measure rather than prevent.  A proportion of crime is driven by the poor economic situation of a population with no choice. Yet, we keep that same population in the same economic conditions as we have limited resources committed to correction (control.) It is way more messy and complex, and we need both, but prevention is not an easy route.  Just think about our current global pandemic, climate change or sustainability.  Prevention was a possibility in each case, but we kick into action now correction is needed. <br><br>In our new digital and data world, we are facing the same issues of prevention vs correction.  Should we prevent data issues or correct data issues, and who owns the problem?  <br><br>In the data industry right now, we correct and just like the criminal services, we have allocated all our budget to correction, so we don’t have time or resources for prevention. I would be rich if I had a dollar for every time I hear, “We need results, Fish, not an x*x*x*x data philosophy.” <br><br>For anyone who follows my views and beliefs, I advocate data quality founded on lineage and provenance (prevention). I am not a fan of the massive industry that has been built up to correct data (correction). I see it as a waste on many levels, but <a href="https://draft.blogger.com/#">FUD</a> sells to a naive buyer. I am a supporter of having a presence at the source of data to <a href="https://draft.blogger.com/#">guarantee attestation</a> and assign rights.  I cannot get my head around the massive budgets set aside to correct “wrong” data.  We believe that data quality is knowing the data is wrong and thinking we can correct it!  We have no idea if the correction is correct, and the updated data still lacks attestation.  We measure this madness and assign KPI to improve our corrective powers.  In this case, because it is data and not humans, prevention is the prefered solution as neither a cure nor correction work at any economic level that can be justified other than your a provider of the service or one of the capital providers. But as already mentioned, prevention is too hard to justify. The same analogy is a recurring theme in the buy (outsource) vs build debate for the new platform, but that is another post.  <br> Unpacking to expose and explore some motivations.  We know that the CDO job emerged in 2002, and some 20 years on, it is still in its infancy.  Tenures are still short (less than three years), and there is a lack of skills and experience because this data and digital thing are all new compared to marketing, finance, or accounting.  As I have written before, our <a href="https://draft.blogger.com/#">job descriptions for the CDO remain poorly defined</a>, with mandates too broad and allocated resources too limited.  All many articles at <a href="https://draft.blogger.com/#">&lt;/Hello CDO&gt;</a> I focus on the conflicts CDO’s have because of the mandates we are given.<br><br>Whilst mandates are too broad, thankfully, security and privacy are becoming new roles with their own mandates. The CDO is still being allocated a data transformation mandate but being asked to correct the data whilst doing it.   Not surprisingly, most data projects fail as the board remains fixated that the data we have is of value, and we should allocate all our resources correcting and securing it.   A bit like the house built on sand,  we endlessly commit resources to unpin a house without foundations because it is there, rather than moving to the more secure ground and building the right house.   Prevention or correction?   <br><br>All CDO’s face the classic problem of being asked to solve the world’s debt famine crisis with no budget, no resources and yesterday would be good.  Solve the data quality problem by correcting the waste at the end.  Because of this commitment to correct data, we find we are trapped.  “We should just finish the job as we have gone so far,”  is what the finance team says,  “prevention is like starting all over again”; it will be too expensive, wreck budgets and we will miss our bonus hurdle as it means a total re-start.  The budget is too big so let’s just put in some more foundations into the house built on sand.<br><br>It is one of my favourite saying “the reason it is called a shortcut, it because it is a short cut and it misses something out”  I often use it when we boil a decision down to an <a href="https://draft.blogger.com/#">ROI number</a>, believing that all the information needed can be presented in a simple single dimensional number.  The correction ideals will always win when we use shortcuts, especially ROI.<br><br> Prevention is a hard sell.  Correction is a simple sell.   Who benefits from an endless correction policy? Probably the CDO!  We get to look super busy, it is easy to get the commitment, and no one will argue at the board/ senior leadership team to do anything else. It might take three years to see the transformation has not happened, and there is plenty of demand for CDO’s? Why would a CDO want to support prevention? Why is the CDO role so in question?<br><br>Prevention takes time, is complex, and you may not see results during your tenure. I often reflect on what <a href="https://draft.blogger.com/#">will be my CDO legacy</a>?  Correction is instant, looks busy and gets results that you can be measured on.   Correction means there is always work to be done.  Prevention means you will eventually be out of a job.  Since prevention cannot be measured and is hard to justify with an ROI calculation,  maybe the CEO needs to focus on measuring the success of analytics?<br> Note to the CEO Data is complex, and like all expert discipline areas, you will seek advice, opinion and counsel from various sources to help form a balanced view.  Data quality is a thorny one as most of those around you will inform you of the benefits of correction over prevention.  Correction wins, and it is unlikely any balanced view arguing for prevention. <br><br>Perhaps it is worth looking at the CDO job description, focusing on what the KPIs are for and how you shift a focus to the outcomes of the analysis.  To improve analysis and outcomes demands better data quality, which correction can only get you so far. You get prevention by the back door.

<p>The UK&nbsp;<a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/ico-codes-of-practice/age-appropriate-design-a-code-of-practice-for-online-services/">Information Commission’s (ICO) Children’s Code</a>, officially known as the“Age Appropriate Design Code: a code of practice for online services,” after a year grace period, goes into effect Thursday, Sept. 2, 2021. The code, which falls under section 125(1)(b) of the UK Data Protection Act 2018 (the Act), looks to protect UK children, i.e., people under the age of eighteen (18).</p>
<p>Are you ready? I hope so; this code applies to any business, in and out of the UK, that provides digital services to UK children. And, it is not the only one of its kind around the world.</p>
 What You Need to Know 
<p>In the digital age, people’s digital footprint is first established months before they’re born, grows exponentially throughout their lives, and carries on after their death. Kids are especially vulnerable to being influenced by digital services; moreover, they are more likely to befall cybercrime. For instance, a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cylab.cmu.edu/_files/pdfs/reports/2011/child-identity-theft.pdf">2011 study by Carnegie Mellon SyLab&nbsp;</a>study found that children were 51% more likely to have their security number used by someone else.</p>
 What is it for? 
<p>The code is designed to ensure that service providers of apps, programs, toys, or any other devices that collect and process children’s data “are appropriate for use by, and meet the development needs of, children.” It calls for 15 independent and interdependent legal, service design, and data processing principles and standards to be followed. Specifically, as called out in the code, these are:</p>
<p>• Best interests of the child • Data protection impact assessments • Age appropriate application• Transparency&nbsp;• Detrimental use of data • Policies and community standard • Default settings • Data minimization • Data sharing • Geolocation • Parental controls • Profiling • Nudge techniques • Connected toys and devices • Online tools</p>
 Who must comply? Risk of non-compliance 
<p>Information society services (ISS) that cater to UK children under the age of 18 or whose services are likely to be accessed by children must adhere to the code or risk ICO public assessment and enforcement notices, warnings, reprimands, and penalty notices (aka administrative fines). Serious code breaches may lead to fines of up to €20 million (or £17.5 million when the UK GDPR comes into effect) or 4% of the provider’s annual worldwide turnover, whichever is higher.</p>
 What you need to do 
<p>Ensuring the digital future and safety of children and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/elderjustice/prosecutors/statutes">venerable adults</a>&nbsp;(people over 18 who cannot meet their own needs or seek help without assistance) is a founding principal of a healthy society and for running a sustainable business. There are several recommended steps you can take to get into and maintain alignment with the code:</p>
<p>1. Consider the likelihood that a child (or vulnerable adult) might use your service,&nbsp;the liability is on the service provider to determine the likelihood a child will use their service. You should conduct user testing, surveys, market research (inc. competitive analysis), and professional and academic literature reviews.</p>
<p>2. Document your data flows (i.e. conduct a data protection impact assessment (DPIA)),&nbsp;your DPIA should consist of data and systems flow diagrams and detailed descriptions of these systems (inc. services, process, and interfaces), all the data flowing through them, and how data is handled. The flow diagram should illustrate each engagement swim lane (e.g., individual, client, company, third-party) and the direction of data flow. The supporting documentation should define each data element and clearly spell out how it will be collected, used and managed. Take it from me and my firsthand experience. The DPIA lens is an invaluable tool for strategic product development. I highly recommend that you not look at the DIPA process as a legal necessity but rather as a valuable framework for learning about and assessing how your products and services work, exactly what they do and why. Performed with the right lens, the DPIA can be a fertile ground for creative inspiration and innovation.</p>
<p>3. Make it a team sport,&nbsp;effective data management is a company-wide, multi-disciplinary activity. It is important that you ensure all key stakeholders, not just legal, IT, security, and compliance, but also marketing, user experience, customer experience, design, support, product, sales, and third-party compliance partners (experts that can help you and your team succeed) all play a role in ensuring your products and services do not just meet legal requirements but exceed people’s expectations.</p>
 But There Is More 
<p>The above steps are extremely useful; however, there are two more considerations that should not be neglected- 1) things are just getting started, and 2) people’s sentiment—“the opportunity to differentiate.”</p>
<p>First,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2020-09-14-gartner-says-by-2023--65--of-the-world-s-population-w">Gartner</a>&nbsp;estimates that 10% of the world’s population is currently protected under people-centric regulation, i.e. regulations like&nbsp;<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">Europe’s GDPR</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?division=3.&amp;part=4.&amp;lawCode=CIV&amp;title=1.81.5">California’s CPPA</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://lgpd-brazil.info/">Brazil’s LGPD</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/20/china-passes-data-protection-law/">China’s data production law</a>&nbsp;which takes effect Nov. 1 2021. By 2023 Gartner estimate this number will rise to 65%. Moreover, keep in mind, it will not just be omnibus rules that take effect; sectoral-specific rules will apply as well. For example, in the United States, the Federal Trade Commission is reevaluating its child protection laws (<a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/complying-coppa-frequently-asked-questions-0">COPPA</a>) and the U.S. Department of Education Department will more than likely be updating the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (<a href="https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html">FERPA</a>). Moreover, there are state-specific regulations similar to the CCPA being enacted. For Instance, in July 2021, Colorado just enacted their people-centric regulations, “<a href="http://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2021A/bills/2021a_190_enr.pdf">Privacy Act of 2021</a>.”</p>
<p>Second, globally, as evidenced by the last seven years of the&nbsp;<a href="https://mobileecosystemforum.com/mefs-7th-annual-global-trust-report/">MEF Global Consumer Trust studies</a>, people are waking up to industry data practices. Simply saying they’re unhappy about them is an understatement. People are connected, they’re concerned, and they want control of their data. The problem is, they’re not exactly sure how to go about it.</p>
<p>There is more to win than just staying on the right side of the law. There is an opportunity for companies to go beyond the law, to recognize that digital privacy, the controls and flows of one’s personal data, should be treated as sacred as one’s physical privacy. Privacy should not be a luxury good obtained only by a select minority; it’s a human right. All three major societal constituents (individuals, private sector organizations, and public sector institutions) need to play their part. There is an opportunity for each to weigh in on this debate, especially public sector players who can differentiate themselves by actively and publicly providing people not just with the utility of the company’s service but with tools and education that help people proactively enact their data rights and to secure and gain agency over their digital footprint, not just now but throughout their entire life. Like global warming, if we each do our part, we can get data back under control and achieve a healthy equilibrium throughout the world’s markets.</p>

<p>At the end of 2020, the Sovrin Foundation published the 12 Principles of SSI, <a href="https://sovrin.org/principles-of-ssi/">https://sovrin.org/principles-of-ssi/</a> .  Building on the earlier works from Kim Cameron, and Christopher Allen, these principles layout what must be foundational principles around any self-sovereign identity system. The evolution of the Principles of SSI came about through the need to differentiate what is ‘true’ SSI versus marketing forces twisting the concept.  This market driven motivator can bring cultish overtones to the process.</p><p>With this event we had a bit of fun in what is otherwise 'serious' business.</p><p>A few themes that come out of the discussion:</p><p>- The position of the holder of the credential - when does the holder become the source of truth and the key to value creation?  In most current business value conversations the holder appears to incidental; the focus is on how to incent the verifiers and issuers with little regard to the position and influence of the holder.  While the SSI ‘triangle’ puts the holder at the ‘top’ of the triangle, the lack of consideration of the trust and value equation there, implies the triangle should be inverted elevating the issuers and verifiers and putting the holder on the bottom.</p><p>- When principles become a means of “locking in” a definition, they become a means of “locking out” those that do not meet the “bar”.  A concern voiced was that with this mental model, and the implication of the moral ‘righteousness’ of this position, the real commercial values of SSI are lost and those not in the ‘cult’ turn away.</p><p>The panelists are:</p>  <p>Simone Ravaioli, Director Digitary</p>  <p>Rob van Kranenberg, IoT Council and NGI Forward</p>  <p>Nicky Hickman, Chair of the ID4All WG, Sovrin Foundation</p>  <p>Michael Shea, Moderator of Vienna Digital Identity Meetup</p>  <p></p><p>To listen to a recording of the event please check out the link: <a href="https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/580329620">https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/580329620</a></p> Time markers:    <p>0:05:00  - Introduction </p>  <p>0:10:07   - Simone Ravaioli </p>  <p>0:17:09   - Nicky Hickman</p>  <p>0:25:44  - Rob van Kranenburg</p>  <p>0:35:00  - General Discussion</p>  <p>1:15:07   - Rob van Kranenburg</p>  <p>1:23:45  - Wrap up </p>   Resources <p>Slide decks:</p>  <p>Simone Ravaioli : Principles vs Cult (Simone)</p>  <p>Nicky Hickman : Principles vs Cult (Nicky)</p>  <p>Rob van Kranenburg : Slide Deck 1  Slide Deck 2</p>  <p>Blog Posts:</p>  <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/stoic-sovereign-identity-ssi-simone-ravaioli/">https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/stoic-sovereign-identity-ssi-simone-ravaioli/</a></p>  <p>If interested in getting notifications of upcoming events please join the event group at: <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Vienna-Digital-Identity-Meetup/">https://www.meetup.com/Vienna-Digital-Identity-Meetup/</a> </p><p>The Vienna Digital Identity Meetup is hosted by The Dingle Group and is focused on educating business, societal, legal and technologists on the new opportunities that arise with  a high assurance digital identity created by the reduction risk and strengthened provenance.

<p>In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/07/27/working-with-postgres-types/">Working with Postgres types</a> I showed an example of a materialized view that depends on a typed set-returning function. Because Postgres knows about that dependency, it won’t allow DROP FUNCTION foo. Instead it requires DROP FUNCTION foo CASCADE.</p>
<p>A similar thing happens with materialized views that depend on tables or other materialized views. Let’s build a cascade of views and consider the implications.</p>
 create materialized view v1 as (
  select 
    1 as number,
    'note_count' as label 
);
SELECT 1

select * from v1;

number | label
-------+-------
     1 | note_count
 
<p>Actually, before continuing the cascade, let’s linger here for a moment. This is a table-like object created without using CREATE TABLE and without explicitly specifying types. But Postgres knows the types.</p>
 \d v1;

Materialized view "public.v1"

Column  | Type 
--------+-----
number  | integer
label   | text
 
<p>The read-only view can become a read-write table like so.</p>
 create table t1 as (select * from v1);
SELECT 1

select * from t1;

number | label
-------+-------
     1 | note_count

\d t1

Table "public.v1"

Column  | Type 
--------+-----
number  | integer
label   | text
 
<p>This ability to derive a table from a materialized view will come in handy later. It’s also just interesting to see how the view’s implicit types become explicit in the table.</p>
<p>OK, let’s continue the cascade.</p>
 create materialized view v2 as (
  select 
    number + 1,
    label
  from v1
);
SELECT 1

select * from v2;

number | label
-------+-------
     2 | note_count

create materialized view v3 as (
  select 
    number + 1,
    label
  from v2
);
SELECT 1

select * from v3;

number | label
-------+-------
     3 | note_count
 
<p>Why do this? Arguably you shouldn’t. Laurenz Albe makes that case in <a href="https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/tracking-view-dependencies-in-postgresql/">Tracking view dependencies in PostgreSQL</a>. Recognizing that it’s sometimes useful, though, he goes on to provide code that can track recursive view dependencies. </p>
<p>I use cascading views advisedly to augment the use of CTEs and functions described in <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/08/21/postgres-functional-style/">Postgres functional style</a>. Views that refine views can provide a complementary form of the chunking that aids reasoning in an analytics system. But that’s a topic for another episode. In this episode I’ll describe a problem that arose in a case where there’s only a single level of dependency from a table to a set of dependent materialized views, and discuss my solution to that probem.</p>
<p>Here’s the setup. We have an annotation table that’s reloaded nightly. On an internal dashboard we have a chart based on the materialized view annos_at_month_ends_for_one_year which is derived from the annotation table and, as its name suggests, reports annotation counts on a monthly cycle. At the beginning of the nightly load, this happens: DROP TABLE annotation CASCADE. So the derived view gets dropped and needs to be recreated as part of the nightly process. But that’s a lot of unnecessary work for a chart that only changes monthly.</p>
<p>Here are two ways to protect a view from a cascading drop of the table it depends on. Both reside in a SQL script, monthly.sql, that only runs on the first of every month. First, annos_at_month_ends_for_one_year.</p>
 drop materialized view annos_at_month_ends_for_one_year;
create materialized view annos_at_month_ends_for_one_year as (
  with last_days as (
    select 
      last_days_of_prior_months( 
        date(last_month_date() - interval '6 year')
      ) as last_day
    ),
    monthly_counts as (
      select
        to_char(last_day, '_YYYY-MM') as end_of_month,
        anno_count_between( 
          date(last_day - interval '1 month'), last_day
        ) as monthly_annos
      from last_days
    )
    select
      end_of_month,
      monthly_annos,
      sum(monthly_annos) over 
        (order by end_of_month asc rows 
           between unbounded preceding and current row
        ) as cumulative_annos
    from monthly_counts
) with data;
 
<p>Because this view depends indirectly on the annotation table  — by way of the function anno_count_between — Postgres doesn’t see the dependency. So the view isn’t affected by the cascading drop of the annotation table. It persists until, once a month, it gets dropped and recreated.</p>
<p>What if you want Postgres to know about such a dependency, so that the view will participate in a cascading drop? You can do this.</p>
 create materialized view annos_at_month_ends_for_one_year as (
  with depends as (
    select * from annotation limit 1
  )
  last_days as (
    ),
  monthly_counts as (
    )
  select
    *
  from monthly_counts;
 
<p>The depends CTE doesn’t do anything relevant to the query, it just tells Postgres that this view depends on the annotation table.</p>
<p>Here’s another way to protect a view from a cascading drop. This expensive-to-build view depends directly on the annotation table but only needs to be updated monthly. So in this case, cumulative_annotations is a table derived from a temporary materialized view.</p>
 create materialized view _cumulative_annotations as (
  with data as (
    select 
      to_char(created, 'YYYY-MM') as created
    from annotation
    group by created
  ) 
  select 
    data.created, 
    sum(data.count) 
      over ( 
        order by data.created asc 
        rows between unbounded preceding and current row
      )
    from data
    group by data.created 
    order by data.created 

drop table cumulative_annotations;

create table cumulative_annotations as (
  select * from _cumulative_annotations
);

drop materialized view _cumulative_annotations;
 
<p>The table cumulative_annotations is only rebuilt once a month. It depends indirectly on the annotation table but Postgres doesn’t see that, so doesn’t include it in the cascading drop.</p>
<p>Here’s the proof.</p>
 -- create a table
create table t1 (number int);

insert into t1 (number) values (1);
INSERT 0 1

select * from t1;

number
-------
     1

-- derive a view from t1
create materialized view v1 as (select * from t1);
SELECT 1

select * from v1

number
-------
     1

-- try to drop t1
drop table t1;

ERROR: cannot drop table t1 because other objects depend on it
DETAIL: materialized view v1 depends on table t1
HINT: Use DROP ... CASCADE to drop the dependent objects too.

-- derive an independent table from t1 by way of a matview
drop materialized view v1;

create materialized view v1 as (select * from t1);
SELECT 1

create table t2 as (select * from v1);
SELECT 1

-- drop the matview
drop materialized view v1;

-- drop t1
drop table t1;

-- no complaint, and t2 still exists
select * from t2;

number
-------
     1
 
<p>These are two ways I’ve found to protect a long-lived result set from the cascading drop of a short-lived table on which it depends. You can hide the dependency behind a function, or you can derive an independent table by way of a transient materialized view. I use them interchangeably, and don’t have a strong preference one way or another. Both lighten the load on the analytics server. Materialized views (or tables) that only need to change weekly or monthly, but were being dropped nightly by cascade from core tables, are now recreated only on their appropriate weekly or monthly cycles.</p>

<p>In this series I’m exploring how to work in a code base that lives in two places: Metabase questions that encapsulate chunks of SQL, and Postgres functions/procedures/views that also encapsulate chunks of SQL. To be effective working with this hybrid collection of SQL chunks, I needed to reason about their interrelationships. One way to do that entailed the creation of a documentation generator that writes a concordance of callers and callees.</p>
<p>Here’s the entry for the function sparklines_for_guid(_guid).</p>
<p></p>
<p>The called by column says that this function is called from two different contexts. One is a Metabase question, All courses: Weekly activity. If you’re viewing that question in Metabase, you’ll find that its SQL text is simply this:</p>
 select * from sparklines_for_guid( {{guid}} )
 
<p>The same function call appears in a procedure, cache warmer, that preemptively memoizes the function for a set of the most active schools in the system. In either case, you can look up the function in the concordance, view its definition, and review how it’s called.</p>
<p>In the definition of sparkline_for_guid, names of other functions (like guid_hashed_view_exists) appear and are linked to their definitions. Similarly, names of views appearing in SELECT or JOIN contexts are linked to their definitions. </p>
<p>Here’s the entry for the function guid_hashed_view_exists. It is called by sparklines_for_guid as well as by functions that drive panels on the school dashboard. It links to the functions it uses: hash_for_guid and exists_view. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Here’s the entry for the view lms_course_groups which appears as a JOIN target in sparklines_for_guid. This central view is invoked — in SELECT or JOIN context — from many functions, from dependent views, and from Metabase questions. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Metabase questions can also “call” other Metabase questions. In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/07/21/a-virtuous-cycle-for-analytics/">A virtuous cycle for analytics</a> I noted: “Queries can emit URLs in order to compose themselves with other queries.” Here’s an example of that.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This Metabase question (985) calls various linked functions, and is called by two other Metabase questions. Here is one of those.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Because this Metabase question (600) emits an URL that refers to 985, it links to the definition of 985. It also links to the view, top_annotated_domains_last_week, from which it SELECTs.</p>
<p>It was straightforward to include Postgres functions, views, and procedures in the concordance since these live in files that reside in the fileystem under source control. Metabase questions, however, live in a database — in our case, a Postgres database that’s separate from our primary Postgres analytics db. In order to extract them into a file I use this SQL snippet.</p>
 select
  r.id,
  m.name as dbname,
  r.name,
  r.description,
  r.dataset_query
from report_card r
join metabase_database m
  on m.id = cast(r.dataset_query::jsonb-&gt;&gt;'database' as int)
where not r.archived
order by r.id;
 
<p>The doc generator downloads that Metabase data as a CSV file, queries.csv, and processes it along with the files that contain the definitions of functions, procedures, and views in the Postgres data warehouse. It also emits queries.txt which is a more convenient way to diff changes from one commit to the next. </p>
<p>This technique solved a couple of problems. First, when we were only using Metabase — unaugmented by anything in Postgres — it enabled us to put our Metabase SQL under source control and helped us visualize relationships among queries.</p>
<p>Later, as we augmented Metabase with Postgres functions, procedures, and views, it became even more powerful. Developing a new panel for a school or course dashboard means writing a new memoized function. That process begins as a Metabase question with SQL code that calls existing Postgres functions, and/or JOINs/SELECTs FROM existing Postgres views. Typically it then leads to the creation of new supporting Postgres functions and/or views. All this can be tested by internal users, or even invited external users, in Metabase, with the concordance available to help understand the relationships among the evolving set of functions and views.</p>
<p>When supporting functions and views are finalized, the SQL content of the Metabase question gets wrapped up in a memoized Postgres function that’s invoked from a panel of a dashboard app. At that point the concordance links the new wrapper function to the same set of supporting functions and views. I’ve found this to be an effective way to reason about a hybrid code base as features move from Metabase for prototyping to Postgres in production, while maintaining all the code under source control.</p>
<p>That foundation of source control is necessary, but maybe not sufficient, for a team to consider this whole approach viable. The use of two complementary languages for in-database programming will certainly raise eyebrows, and if it’s not your cup of tea I completely understand. If you do find it appealing, though, one thing you’ll wonder about next will be tooling. I work in VSCode nowadays, for which I’ve not yet found a useful extension for pl/pgsql or pl/python. With <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/08/13/pl-python-metaprogramming/">metaprogramming</a> life gets even harder for aspiring pl/pgsql or pl/python VSCode extensions. I can envision them, but I’m not holding my breath awaiting them. Meanwhile, two factors enable VSCode to be helpful even without deep language-specific intelligence.</p>
<p>The first factor, and by far the dominant one, is outlining. In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2019/09/05/products-and-capabilities/">Products and capabilities</a> I reflect on how I’ve never adopted an outlining product, but often rely on outlining capability infused into a product. In VSCode that’s “only” basic indentation-driven folding and unfolding. But I find it works remarkably well across SQL queries, views and functions that embed them, CTEs that comprise them, and pl/pgsql or pl/python functions called by them. </p>
<p>The second factor, nascent thus far, is GitHub Copilot. It’s a complementary kind of language intelligence that’s aware of, but not bounded by, what a file extension of .sql or .py implies. It can sometimes discern patterns that mix language syntaxes and offer helpful suggestions. That hasn’t happened often so far, but it’s striking when it does. I don’t yet know the extent to which it may be <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/07/11/working-with-intelligent-machines/">training me while I train it</a>, or how those interactions might influence others. At this point I’m not a major Copilot booster, but I am very much an interested observer of and participant in the experiment.</p>
<p>All in all, I’m guardedly optimistic that existing or feasible tooling can enable individuals and teams to sanely navigate the hybrid corpus of source code discussed in this series. If you’re along for the ride, you’ll next wonder about debugging and monitoring a system built this way. That’s a topic for a future episode.</p>

   America has fallen; taken hostage by political cults, our once great bastion of "Individual Liberty" has fallen victim to the mobs ruled by media disinformation, inadequate education, and technical gerrymandering by algorithm. People have become operational devotees to artificial participatory groupings functioning as mobs of influence. This "devotion" to practice has yielded a system at odds with Constitutional integrity.  <br>  How did this happen?  <br>  Why did Individual people cede authority to a system that abstracts them into legal definitions out of step with observable reality? "We The People" no longer function as actual people, Individuals all. Instead, "We" are a legal abstraction duly represented by a Government once established "of, by, for people". This legalese slight of hand has manifested a bureaucratic system of artificial intelligence, and cult-based political control, wherein Individuals are regarded as a threat to stability.  <br>  People in the real world can observe that the only human beings they ever meet or come to know are all Individuals. It is our choices which form cults, our methods that make mobs. Once made, these are hard to unmake for any one person. For they exist to defy and destroy the integrity of Individual empowerment. Groups harvest people by consent, or manipulation, and the harvesting creates a new intent. Seeing clearly this new intent is useful in understanding how/why cults come into power.  <br>  In Government funded education, a cult of practice or pedagogy is limited by credentialed membership. The support of one cult member for another is advanced by a caring community of social influence all in harmony with the manner by which their credentialed membership is enforced, and employed. The unionization of labor within this cult of pedagogy further entrenches the practices and support structure that any student or family in any zip code can anticipate receiving education from. Where methods of functional literacy fall short due to rapidly evolving practices in the real world, the structure of practice and labor serves to enforce the pace of available change/progress offered to students and families.  <br>  Everyone can see this happening for themselves, and many Individual Teachers will openly and adamantly acknowledge this operational fact, and their support for the stability of labor value tied to their cult of practice is hard to argue with, for as people, they certainly deserve respect for their working efforts. This then is the point wherein the structural outcomes derived by cults begins its insidious assault on communities, cultures, Nations and people, Individuals all.  <br>  Cults are not made by "bad people". Cults are made by "bad choices". Enforcing bad choices is the problem of greatest consequence. Look around, where does the enforcement of bad choices come from? How is our civil Society being forced into bad choices that yield outcomes out of step with our intent as a people who create their own way, in life, liberty and the pursuits of happiness guaranteed by our Governing assemblage?&nbsp;  <br>  This is our enemy America.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.moxytongue.com/2020/08/kill-cult.html">People must kill the tendency towards cults.</a>  <br>  Cult rule never solves problems.. it just increases costs on infinite horizon of mass delusion for bureaucratic control.&nbsp;  <br>  Corporate bureaucracies extending from DOD, US CONGRESS, DOE, and every other department of every Federal and State Government all follow this same line of structural management by cult of practice. After retiring, contractors provide service of relationships between the same Government offices and personnel that they once worked with, enabling the efficient processing of opportunity by trust and devotion to a cult of practice. One political cult is elected and operational devotees arrive en masse to take their seats in the administrative machinery availed to their servicing mandates. With each Presidential election, this process can be experienced anew in Washington DC. A city emerges from the cults of influence that give operational meaning to time.&nbsp;  <br>  Taken to its extreme, the predictive outcomes that cult behaviors of practice/behavior/attention produce are easily harvested by propaganda-inducing algorithms used to influence mass sentiment. <a href="https://themarkup.org/citizen-browser/2021/08/10/how-the-daily-wire-uses-facebooks-targeted-advertising-to-build-its-brand">Advertising methods in social media systems</a> designed to produce cult behavior tendencies for ease of tracking attention and gaining access to social graphs where people influence one another as friends, brothers, sisters, daughters, sons, grandmas &amp; grandpas.. all for the purpose of producing cult outcomes for the predictable harvesting of management value. Any purpose, trackable cult behaviors. Any intent, trackable cult attention. Any manipulation, trackable cult influence.&nbsp;  <br>  Individual liberty that gives rise to a Nation and civil Society derived of, by, for people, Individuals all must be protected, at all costs. This is a structural requirement. People are not "people"; abstractions are not accurate enough. People are Individuals, and their operational participation is founded in the local mud, by the blood running through their veins for the integrity of their local community, culture and way of life.  <br>  Individual liberty has enemies, both well documented ones and new ones that appear from time to time. The Chinese Communist Party is one such enemy. Cults that remove Individual responsibility and induce group think are another. A systemic bureaucracy run by harvesting big data under surveillance technologies operating with artificial intelligence across time and space is another. These are insidious organizations of destructive intent, hell bent on capturing the loyalty of people, in lieu of allowing for actual free will expressed by people. Families must guard and protect the light of freedom found inside of each of us as people.&nbsp;  <br>  Bureaucracies around the world are racing towards the use of data aggregated for profound purposes, and are rapidly constituting a new type of "artificial intelligence" that is out of step with the inherent Rights of people, Individuals all.  <br>  Unless this aggregated effect of "We" is challenged to show its hand, to prove it exists to empower people, Individuals all, rather than replace them with an abstraction of literature or computer science &amp; engineering, everything that "We The People" hold dear will come to an end, replaced by a new version existing not "of, by, for" each of us, but instead.  <br>  The benefits of this transition will be cast broadly; Government-issued welfare benefits, a creator economy preying on the vanities of youth, and the destruction of work in favor of administration, delegation, crowdsourcing, and monetization of the cult attention graph. People will get rich for their compliant participation, while civil society gets weaker, less credulous, and more apt to extreme swings of behavior based on cult support for policies of the day.  <br>  You either stand for your Individual Rights, or you have none in the end. Standing means understanding how your Rights came to be, and how the source of your authority is the only protection you possess from cult rule. Mobs are spawning, and data aggregation via social-technical tools graphing the attention of people, and segmenting them by algorithm into easily targeted groups that can be harvested for financial and political gain is rampant. General data illiteracy is Nation-wide, around the entire globe. Political cults feed lies via media disinformation keeping people occupied trying to figure out how to be part of the group they agree with, most of the time.. some of the time.. today, for a specific reason.. always by cult association. Left cult, Right cult.. no people, no Individuals anywhere.  <br>  ID is the control parameter of freedom and security in a civil society. The source of your ID matters.

<p>The OAuth 2.0 JWT-Secured Authorization Request (JAR) specification has been published as <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9101">RFC 9101</a>.  Among other applications, this specification is used by the <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-1_0.html">OpenID Financial-grade API (FAPI)</a>.  This is another in the series of RFCs bringing <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a>-defined functionality to OAuth 2.0.  Previous such RFCs included “OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol” [<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7591.html">RFC 7591</a>] and “OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata” [<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8414.html">RFC 8414</a>].</p>
<p>The abstract of the RFC is:</p>
<blockquote><p><br>
The authorization request in OAuth 2.0 described in RFC 6749 utilizes query parameter serialization, which means that authorization request parameters are encoded in the URI of the request and sent through user agents such as web browsers. While it is easy to implement, it means that a) the communication through the user agents is not integrity protected and thus, the parameters can be tainted, b) the source of the communication is not authenticated, and c) the communication through the user agents can be monitored. Because of these weaknesses, several attacks to the protocol have now been put forward.</p>
<p><br>
This document introduces the ability to send request parameters in a JSON Web Token (JWT) instead, which allows the request to be signed with JSON Web Signature (JWS) and encrypted with JSON Web Encryption (JWE) so that the integrity, source authentication, and confidentiality properties of the authorization request are attained. The request can be sent by value or by reference.<br>
</p></blockquote>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>My dual premises in this series are:</p>
<p>– Modern SQL is more valuable as a programming language than you might think (see Markus Winand’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEDZQtAHpX8">Modern SQL: A lot has changed since SQL-92</a>)</p>
<p>– Postgres is more valuable as a programming environment than you might think. (see R0ml Lefkowitz’s <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/01/24/the-image-of-postgres/">The Image of Postgres</a>)</p>
<p>As the patron saint of trailing edge technology it is my duty to explore what’s possible at the intersection of these two premises. The topic for this episode is Postgres functional style. Clearly what I’ve been doing with the combo of pl/python and pl/pgsql is very far from pure functional programming. The self-memoization technique shown in <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/08/19/postgres-set-returning-functions-that-self-memoize-as-materialized-views/What%20I%20showed">episode 7</a> is all about mutating state (ed: this means writing stuff down somewhere). But it feels functional to me in the broader sense that I’m using functions to orchestrate behavior that’s expressed in terms of SQL queries.</p>
<p>To help explain what I mean, I’m going to unpack one of the Postgres functions in our library. </p>
 count_of_distinct_lms_students_from_to(_guid text, _from date, _to date)
 
<p>This is a function that accepts a school id (aka guid), a start date, and an end date. Its job is to:</p>
<p>– Find all the courses (groups) for that school (guid)</p>
<p>– Filter to those created between the start and end date</p>
<p>– Find all the users in the filtered set of courses</p>
<p>– Filter to just students (i.e. omit instructors)</p>
<p>– Remove duplicate students (i.e., who are in more than one course)</p>
<p>– Return the count of distinct students at the school who annotated in the date range</p>
<p>The production database doesn’t yet store things in ways friendly to this outcome, so doing all this requires some heavy lifting in the analytics data warehouse. Here’s the function that orchestrates that work.</p>
 create function count_of_distinct_lms_students_from_to(_guid text, _from date, _to date) 
  returns bigint as $$
  declare count bigint;
  begin
 1  -- all groups active for the guid in the date range
 2  with groups as (
 3    select pubid from groups_for_guid(_guid)
 4    where group_is_active_from_to(pubid, _from, _to)
 5  ),
 6  -- usernames in those groups
 7  usernames_by_course as (
 8    select
 9      pubid,
10      (users_in_group(pubid)).username 
11  from groups 
12  ),
13  -- filtered to just students
14  students_by_course as (
15    select * from usernames_by_course
16    where not is_instructor(username, pubid)
17  )
18  select 
19    count (distinct username) 
20  from students_by_course
    into count;
    return count;
  end;
$$ language plpgsql;
 
<p>If you think pl/pgsql is old and clunky, then you are welcome to do this in pl/python instead. There’s negligible difference between how they’re written and how fast they run. It’s the same chunk of SQL either way, and it exemplifies the functional style I’m about to describe. </p>
<p>Two kinds of chunking work together here: CTEs (aka common table expressions, aka WITH clauses) and functions. If you’ve not worked with SQL for a long time, as I hadn’t, then CTEs may be unfamiliar. I think of them as pipelines of table transformations in which each stage of the pipeline gets a name. In this example those names are groups (line 2), usernames_by_course (line 7), and students_by_course (line 14). </p>
<p>The pipeline phases aren’t functions that accept parameters, but I still think of them as being function-like in the sense that they encapsulate named chunks of behavior. The style I’ve settled into aims to make each phase of the pipeline responsible for a single idea (“groups active in the range”, “usernames in those groups”), and to express that idea in a short snippet of SQL. </p>
<p>As I’m developing one of these pipelines, I test each phase. To test the first phase, for example, I’d do this in psql or Metabase.</p>
 -- all groups active for the guid in the date range
with groups as (
  select pubid from groups_for_guid('8anU0QwbgC2Cq:canvas-lms')
  where group_is_active_from_to(pubid, '2021-01-01', '2021-05-01')
)
select * from groups;
 
<p>And I’d spot-check to make sure the selected groups for that school really are in the date range. Then I’d check the next phase.</p>
 -- all groups active for the guid in the date range
with groups as (
),
-- usernames in those groups
usernames_by_course as (
  select
    pubid,
    (users_in_group(pubid)).username 
  from groups 
)
select * from usernames_by_course;
 
<p>After another sanity check against these results, I’d continue to the next phase, and eventually arrive at the final result. It’s the same approach I take with regular expressions. I am unable to visualize everything that’s happening in a complex regex. But I can reason effectively about a pipeline of matches that occur in easier-to-understand named steps.</p>
<p>Ideally each phase in one of these pipelines requires just a handful of lines of code: few enough to fit within the 7 +- 2 limit of working memory. Postgres functions make that possible. Here are the functions used in this 20-line chunk of SQL.</p>
<p>– groups_for_guid(guid): Returns a table of course ids for a school.</p>
<p>– group_is_active_from_to(pubid, _from, _to): Returns true if the group was created in the range.</p>
<p>– users_in_group(pubid): Returns a table of user info for a course.</p>
<p>– is_instructor(username, pubid): Returns true if that user is an instructor.</p>
<p>Two of these, groups_for_guid and users_in_group, are set-returning functions. As noted in <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/07/27/working-with-postgres-types/">Working with Postgres types</a>, they have the option of returning an explicit Postgres type defined elsewhere, or an implicit Postgres type defined inline. As it happens, both do the latter.</p>
 create or replace function groups_for_guid(_guid text)
  returns table(
    pubid text
  ) as $$
 
 create or replace function users_in_group (_pubid text)
  returns table (
    groupid text, 
    username text, 
    display_name text
  ) as $$
 
<p>The other two, group_is_active_from_to and is_instructor, return boolean values.</p>
<p>All this feels highly readable to me now, but the syntax of line 10 took quite a while to sink in. It helps me to look at what users_in_group(pubid) does in a SELECT context.</p>
 select * from users_in_group('4VzA92Yy')

groupid   | username    | display_name
----------+-------------+----------------
4VzA92Yy  | 39vA94AsQp  | Brendan Nadeau
 
<p>Here is an alternate way to write the usernames_by_course CTE at line 7.</p>
 -- usernames in those groups
usernames_by_course as (
  select
    g.pubid,
    u.username
from groups g 
join users_in_group(g.pubid) u on g.pubid = u.groupid
)
select * from usernames_by_course;
 
<p>Both do exactly the same thing in very close to the same amount of time. Having mixed the two styles I’m leaning toward the first, but you could go either way or both. What matters more is the mental leverage you wield when writing CTEs and functions together to compose pipelines of transformations, and that others wield when reading and debugging.</p>
<p>I hope I’ve made the case for writing and reading. There’s a case to be made for debugging too, but that’s another episode.</p>

<p>It used to be that dairy farmers relied on whatever was growing in the area to feed their cattle. They filled the trough with vegetation grown right on the farm. They probably relied heavily on whatever grasses grew naturally and perhaps added some high-value grains like barley and corn. Today, with better technology and knowledge, dairy farmers work with nutritionists to develop a personalized concentrate of carbohydrates, proteins, fats, minerals, and vitamins that gets added to the natural feed. The result is much healthier cattle and more predictable growth.<br><br>We’re going through a similar enlightenment in the security space. To get the best results, we need to fill the trough that our Machine Learning will eat from with high-value data feeds from our existing security products (whatever happens to be growing in the area) but also (and more precisely for this discussion) from beyond what we typically consider security products to be.</p><p>In the post, I make the case that "we shouldn’t limit our security data to what has traditionally been in-scope for security discussions" and how understanding Application Topology (and feeding that knowledge into the security trough) can help reduce risk and improve security.</p><p>Here's an excerpt:</p><p></p><p></p><p>We’re all guilty of thinking myopically at times. It’s easy to get  caught up thinking about the objects in our foreground and to lose our  sense of depth. We forget about the environment and the context and we  focus too narrowly on some singular subject. It’s not always a bad  thing. Often, we need to focus very specifically to take on challenges  that would otherwise be too big to address. For example, security  professionals spend a lot of time thinking about specific attack vectors  (or security product categories). And each one perhaps necessarily  requires a deep level of focus and expertise. I’m not arguing against  that. But I’d like to suggest that someone on the team should expand  their focus to think about the broader environment in which cyberattacks  and security breaches take place. When you do, I suspect that you’ll  find that there are data points from outside of the typical security  realm that, if leveraged correctly, will dramatically improve your  ability to respond to threats within that realm.</p> <p>I posted recently about the importance of <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/cloudsecurity/convergence-security">convergence</a> (of security functionality). I noted that “Security solutions are  evolving toward cloud, toward built-in intelligence via Machine  Learning, and toward unified, integrated-by-design platforms.” I went on  to suggest that forward-looking security platforms are autonomous and  operate with minimal human intervention. I believe that’s where we’re  heading. But to better enable machine learning and autonomous security,  we need to feed as much relevant data as possible into the system. We  need to feed the machine from an expanding trough of data. And with  Internet scale as an enabler, we shouldn’t limit our security data to  what has traditionally been in-scope for security discussions.</p> <p>As an example, I’m going to talk about how understanding Application Topology (and feeding that knowledge into the security trough) can help reduce risk and improve your security posture.</p> <p>What is Application Topology?</p> <p>As you likely know, modern applications are typically architected  into logical layers or tiers. With web and mobile applications, we’ve  traditionally seen a presentation layer, an application or middleware  tier, and a backend data tier. With serverless compute and cloud  microservice architectures, an application’s workload may be even more  widely distributed. It’s even common to see core application functions  being outsourced to third parties via the use of APIs and open  standards. Application Topology understands all the various parts of an  application and how they’re interrelated. Understanding the App Topology  means that you can track and correlate activity across components that  may reside in several different clouds.</p> <p>How does Application Topology impact security?</p> <p>Consider an application that serves a package delivery service. It  has web, mobile, and API interfaces that serve business line owners,  delivery drivers, corporate accounts, and consumer customers. It’s core  application logic runs on one popular cloud platform while the data  storage backend runs on another. The application leverages an identity  cloud service using several authentication techniques for the several  audiences. It calls out to a third-party service that feeds traffic  &amp; weather information and interacts with other internal applications  and databases that provide data points such as current pricing based on  regional gas prices, capacity planning, and more. Think about what it  means to secure an application like this.</p> <p>Many popular security tools focus only on one layer or one component.  A tool may scan the web application or the mobile app but probably not  both. An app like this might have a few different security products that  focus on securing APIs and a few others that focus on securing  databases. Even if all components feed their security events into a  common stream, there’s not likely a unified view of the risk posture for  the application as a whole. None of the security tools are likely to  understand the full application topology. If the app owner asked for a  security report for the entire application, would you be able to provide  it? How many different security products would you need to leverage?  Would you be able to quantify the impact of a single security  configuration issue on the application as a whole?</p> <p>If a security solution fully understands the application topology and  incorporates that knowledge, here are a few of the benefits: You can  generate a holistic report on the application to the app owner that  covers all components whether on-premises, in the cloud, or via  third-parties. You can monitor user activity at one tier and understand  how that impacts your risk posture across other tiers. You can monitor  for security configuration changes at all components via a unified  service and automatically adjust risk scores accordingly. In other  words, a deep understanding of the IT infrastructure underneath the  application yields a more robust understanding of security issues and an  increased ability to respond quickly and automatically.</p> <p>Summary</p> <p>Challenge yourself to expand the scope of which data points might be  useful for improving security. Are security appliance event logs and  threat feeds enough? As we enter an era dominated by AI and Machine  Learning, we need to add as much high-value data as possible into the  security trough. ML performs better as it incorporates more information.  And as Larry Ellison famously said, the threats are becoming  increasingly more sophisticated. “It can't be our people versus their  computers. We're going to lose that war. It's got to be our computers  versus their computers.” We must rely on Machine Learning and we have to  feed it with as much intelligence from as many sources as possible.</p><p></p>

<p>I published a new article today on the <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/cloudsecurity/">Oracle Security blog</a> that looks at the benefits of convergence in the security space as the IT landscape grows more disparate and distributed.<br><br>Security professionals have too many overlapping products under management and it's challenging to get quick and complete answers across hybrid, distributed environments. It's challenging to fully automate detection and response. There is too much confusion about where to get answers, not enough talent to cover the skills requirement, and significant hesitation to put the right solutions in place because there's already been so much investment.<br><br>Here's an excerpt:</p><p>The whole of your security portfolio should provide significantly more value than the sum of its parts.</p> <p>The challenge facing security professionals seems to grow bigger and  more complex by the hour. New threats and risk factors are constantly  emerging while the IT landscape continuously evolves. At times, it feels  like we’re patching holes on a moving target that’s endlessly  shape-shifting. One of the major contributing factors to those feelings  of chaos and disorder is the sheer quantity of security products that we  rely on to cover our vast IT landscapes.</p> <p>The <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/cloud-threat-report.html">Oracle and KPMG Cloud Threat Report 2018</a> found that cybersecurity professionals manage an average of 46  different security products. 7% of respondents reported being personally  responsible for managing over 100 different products. 100 different  security products! I don’t imagine that those folks can possibly have a  complete understanding of what’s happening across 50 or 100 different  security products or what value each of those products is contributing  to reducing their risk. This quantity of products alone contributes to  the overall challenge in several ways, including:</p>   Product Overlap: Security products often have  significant functional overlap. In an environment with several security  products, it quickly becomes unclear which product will answer which  questions. The result is wasted time and effort and longer delays  getting critical answers. When addressing an on-going attack or a  breach, the speed of the response effort is critical. The longer it  takes, the broader the damage will be.  Skills Shortage: Organizations spend too much time  finding or developing talent across security products. It’s rare for  security professionals to have the exact mix of skills and experience  that an organization needs. And with an on-going skills shortage, it’s  difficult to retain top talent over long periods of time. Again, not  having the right expertise in place means that you’re more likely to  miss the signals of developing attacks or on-going breaches and to  demonstrate longer response times to security events.  Delays in Addressing Gaps: Nobody likes wasted money or shelfware.  When a gap is found in an organization’s security posture, security  professionals are less likely to find and deploy the right solution if  they have numerous other security solutions in place that may (or may  not) fix the problem. Of course, without a complete understanding of  where the limits are on each of those products, it could take months to  sort through them and to formulate an approach. It’s the classic human  response of freezing in indecision when there are too many factors to  consider. When it comes to addressing information security issues, the  last thing you want to do is freeze.   <p>So, what can be done and how can we address the issue?</p> <p>Here’s the good news: Security solutions are evolving toward cloud,  toward built-in intelligence via Machine Learning, and toward unified,  integrated-by-design platforms. This approach eliminates the issues of  product overlap because each component is designed to leverage the  others. It reduces the burden related to maintaining skills because  fewer skills are needed and the system is more autonomous. And, it  promotes immediate and automated response as opposed to indecision.  While there may not be a single platform to replace all 50 or 100 of  your disparate security products today, platforms are emerging that can  address core security functions while simplifying ownership and  providing open integration points to seamlessly share security  intelligence across functions.</p> <p>For example, you know that you need an identity and access component  for addressing access management needs across numerous SaaS applications  and IaaS services. And you need a <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/paas/casb-cloud-service.html">Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB)</a> to scan SaaS applications and Cloud Infrastructures for insecure  configurations and to monitor user activity. But, for the most part,  these functions are silo’ed today. One doesn’t talk to the other. But  they can. And they should.</p> <p>Understanding what a user is doing across cloud applications  (visibility often provided by CASB) enables you to create a risk score  for that user that can then be used by the Identity function to make  decisions and take actions such as stepping up authentication,  requesting approvals, initiating an access review, or denying access.  Understanding that a target system’s configuration was modified recently  or that it doesn’t conform to the organization’s security policies also  increases risk. And there are numerous sources of additional risk data:  identity, CASB, security configuration scanning, SIEM, UEBA, external  threat feeds, session context, etc.</p> <p>Forward-looking security platforms will leverage hybrid cloud  architecture to address hybrid cloud environments. They’re autonomous  systems that operate without relying on human maintenance, patching, and  monitoring. They leverage risk intelligence from across the numerous  available sources. And then they rationalize that data and use Machine  Learning to generate better security intelligence and feed that improved  intelligence back to the decision points. And they leverage built-in  integration points and orchestration functionality to automate response  when appropriate.</p> <p>In other words, your security platform should serve as a central  brain that doesn’t only import the various security data points but also  makes sense of it without relying on human eyes to catch potential  threats. And it adds intelligence, identifies patterns, recognizes  anomalies, and responds appropriately and within seconds. This is much  more advanced than the old SIEM model which simply aggregates data from  numerous sources and tries to raise alerts for humans to evaluate. This  is a system that thinks for you and leverages advanced analytics to make  decisions across those numerous disparate systems. It’s a cloud service  so you don’t need to administer and manage it. You become a user; a  consumer of its benefits rather than a caretaker. And the result is much  more value and further reduced risk than you’d get from the parts  alone.</p>

<p>I published an article today on the <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/cloudsecurity">Oracle Cloud Security blog</a> that takes a look at how approaches to information security must adapt to address the needs of the future state (of IT). For some organizations, it's really the current state. But, I like the term future state because it's inclusive of more than just cloud or hybrid cloud. It's the universe of Information Technology the way it will be in 5-10 years. It includes the changes in user behavior, infrastructure, IT buying, regulations, business evolution, consumerization, and many other factors that are all evolving simultaneously.<br><br>As we move toward that new world, our approach to security must adapt. Humans chasing down anomalies by searching through logs is an approach that will not scale and will not suffice.&nbsp;</p><p>Here's an excerpt:<br><br></p>    <p>If you never change tactics, you lose <br>the moment the enemy changes theirs<br></p><p>While chasing down a domestic terrorist, FBI Agent Will Brody found  himself in an unfamiliar and dangerous environment. (Brody is the  protagonist in Marcus Sakey's 2017 novel Afterlife.) To survive  in its perilous conditions, its residents commit to two simple rules:  (1) pull your own weight and (2) only kill in self-defense. These rules  have kept them safe from the obvious imminent threats around them for  decades. But Brody sees a change happening in the environment that  others don't yet see and warns his new community: "If you never change  tactics, you lose the moment the enemy changes theirs." His mantra  becomes "New World, New Rules." In other words, you must adapt to changing threats or face the consequences.</p> <p>As Information Security professionals, we find ourselves in a similar  situation. Our environment is transforming rapidly. The assets we're  protecting today look very different than they did just a few years ago.  In addition to owned data centers, our workloads are being spread  across multiple cloud platforms and services. Users are more mobile than  ever. And we don’t have control over the networks, devices, or  applications where our data is being accessed. It’s a vastly distributed  environment where there’s no single, connected, and controlled network.  Line-of-Business managers purchase compute power and SaaS applications  with minimal initial investment and no oversight. And end-users access  company data via consumer-oriented services from their personal devices.  It's grown increasingly difficult to tell where company data  resides, who is using it, and ultimately where new risks are emerging. This transformation is on-going and the threats we’re facing are  morphing and evolving to take advantage of the inherent lack of  visibility.</p> <p>Organizations are in varying stages of migration toward this future state of IT where we have massive distribution and where visibility is elusive. But  we all seem to be moving in the same direction. So, we simply can't  live by the same old rules. We can’t rely on old security techniques. New World, New Rules.</p>   <p>The old SIEM approach won't suffice <br>in the future state. <br></p><p>Traditionally, security professionals have relied heavily on SIEM  (Security Information and Event Management) solutions to track activity  in their environments. The SIEMs resided somewhere on the network and  collected logs and event information from other network-connected  systems and devices. SIEMs measured themselves by their ability to  ingest data from anything and everything on the network. But SIEM users have struggled to translate that event data into actionable intelligence. In many cases, because of the enormous quantity of event data and the  inability to parse it quickly and efficiently, SIEM solutions became  forensic tools; used after-the-fact to research what may have happened  after a breach was detected. The old SIEM approach won't suffice in the  future state.</p> <p>Although many organizations report struggling with the complexity and  cost of SIEM solutions, the SIEM market continues to expand. This is  because the need for visibility has only grown more urgent with  increasing regulations and more aggressive and sophisticated attack  techniques. But you want more. Traditional SIEM approaches aren't enough. There simply aren't enough hands-on-deck to rely on manual processes  for investigating event data or identifying on-going attacks.</p><p>The technologies that have exacerbated the <br>problem can also be used to address it <br></p><p>Here's the good news: The technologies that have exacerbated the  problem can also be used to address it. On-premises SIEM solutions based  on appliance technology may not have the reach required to address  today's IT landscape. But, an integrated SIEM+UEBA designed from the  ground up to run as a cloud service and to address the massively  distributed hybrid cloud environment can leverage technologies like  machine learning and threat intelligence to provide the visibility and  intelligence that is so urgently needed.</p> <p><a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/cloudsecurity/machines-vs-machines-how-adaptive-intelligence-can-save-you-from-a-breach">Machine Learning (ML)</a> mitigates the complexity of understanding what's actually happening and of sifting through  massive amounts of activity that may otherwise appear to humans as  normal. Modern attacks leverage distributed compute power and ML-based  intelligence. So, countering those attacks requires a security solution  with equal amounts of intelligence and compute power. As Larry Ellison  recently said, "It can't be our people versus their computers. We're  going to lose that war. It's got to be our computers versus their  computers."</p> <p>But to effectively secure the future state, you need more than a SIEM  designed for cloud. Here are a few other innovations that we should  demand from our security platform:</p>   Application Topology Awareness: Detect multi-tier application attacks and lateral movement indicators. Alert application owners not server administrators.  Threat Stage Awareness: Map potential and  in-progress threats to well understood attack stages to provide better  contextual data on how to respond. See developing threats before they  happen.  Data-Deep Visibility: Detect data access anomalies for any user, database or application.  Broad Data Capture: Don't rely solely on security logs. Leverage operational logs, threat feeds, embedded reputation data, and more.  User Attribution: Report the identity even if the user context is missing via composite identity awareness and rich user baselines.  Configuration Change Awareness: Inject configuration drift context into threat detection.  Orchestration: Respond to threats immediately and with precision via REST, scripts, or 3rd party automation frameworks.   <p>Obviously, we're writing about this for a reason. These features are built into Oracle's <a href="https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/security-analytics">Security Monitoring and Analytics</a> service (SMA). When we say that our SIEM was designed from the ground  up for cloud, we're not just talking about the product architecture.  We're talking about its features and functionality. It was designed to  address the complexity and peril of distributed cloud environments. It was designed to secure the future state; to be the new rules for the new world.</p> <p>SMA is built on Oracle’s unified platform for future-state security that also includes <a href="https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/identity">Identity</a>, <a href="https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/casb">CASB</a>, and <a href="https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/compliance">Configuration Compliance</a>.  It was built 100% in the cloud to address the security needs of hybrid,  multi-cloud environments. Traditional SIEMs lack Identity, CASB, and  Configuration Compliance functions. And they typically only layer UEBA  on top of their legacy SIEM architecture. They lack advanced features  like data-deep visibility, user attribution, <a href="https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/orchestration">orchestration</a>, and awareness of threat stages and application topology. Leveraging these innovations, Oracle's approach enables shorter investigations and faster response times while accommodating for all the complexity of the future state.</p><p>Oracle simplifies management and <br>security for the future state. <br></p><p>And, to top it off, Oracle's security services are built on <a href="https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/management">Oracle Management Cloud</a> which,  in addition to security, provides a single pane of glass for IT  monitoring, management, and analytics. Oracle simplifies management and  security for the future state, reducing cost and effort, and providing  richer intelligence across increasingly complex environments.</p> <p>Learn more about how Oracle is addressing these security concerns and  incorporating machine learning into adaptive intelligence by reading  our whitepaper, <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/solutions/cloud/future-of-cyber-security-4302684.pdf">"Machine Learning-Based Adaptive Intelligence: The Future of Cybersecurity."</a></p>
