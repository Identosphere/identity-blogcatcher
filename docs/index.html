Sounds like a bad arrangement."</p>

  <p>Summary:      A recent trip through SL airport's new TSA screening area shows why bureaucracies legibility fails. People aren't corporate or hierarchical. Instead they're messy... and innovative.</p>


<p>
    I just flew for the first time in 16 months. In that time, Salt Lake International Airport got a new terminal, including an update to the TSA screening area. The new screening area has been <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/news/press/releases/2020/09/22/tsa-highlights-features-security-checkpoint-new-slc">touted as a model of efficiency</a>, featuring bin stations for people to load their bags, electronics, belts, and shoes into bins that they then push onto a conveyor. The bins are handled automatically and everything is sunshine and joy. Except it isn't.
</p>

<p>
    The new system is perfect so long as the people using it are too. The first problem is that unless your at the last bin station, the conveyor in front of you is constantly full and it's hard to get your bin onto the conveyor. And if you've got more than one bin to load, they are separated from each other because the loading station isn't big enough for two. People just don't conform to the TSA's ideal!
</p>

<p>
    But the real problem is that people forget things in their pockets or don't take off their belt. In the olden days, the TSA had little bowls. You'd throw your stuff in one, put it on the belt, and be on your way. Now, there's no easy way to accommodate forgotten things except to go back to a bin loading station and put them in a big bin, clogging the conveyor even more. Three people in line ahead of me at the scanner forgot something, causing all kinds of delays. The TSA people were even telling them to just hold them in the scanner and taking them from them to hold while the scan was completed. Because there's no good way to deal with forgotten items, everyone is forced to improvise, but the system is rigid and doesn't easily accommodate improvisation. 
</p>

<p>
    The situation reminded me of the story James C. Scott tells in the opening of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0300246757/windleyofente-20">Seeing Like a State</a> where forestry officials planted neat, efficient rows of trees instead of letting the forest take its natural path. The end result was less yield from the forest, but happier foresters who could now see every tree. Scott's point is that bureaucracy aims for legibility in order to serve its own purposes—and usually fails in that effort. The primary reason states have wanted legibility of citizens is taxes (and, historically, conscription). But once you have legibility, the temptation to extend it to other uses is too great to resist. In this case, the TSA has ordered the screening process and made it legible to the screeners, but made no provision for outliers. If no one forgets anything and the system is lightly loaded, it should work great. Of course, that's not the real world.  
</p>

<p>
    IT people are bureaucrats in their own way. We build and operate the systems that people use to do their jobs and live their lives. We strive for legibility in order to make the software simpler for us, even if it doesn't serve the users quite as well. Universities are decentralized places with lots of innovative people pursuing their own goals. They are more feudal than corporate. I've often heard university IT people complain about this reality because it makes their life harder.  If you're a professor, you'd like to use whichever LMS suits your particular needs. But that's not very legible. If you're a university IT person, you'd like to force all faculty to use the standard LMS that the university chose. Neat and orderly, but it squeezes the innovation out of the university one drop at a time. 
</p>

<p>
    Life is messy. People are forgetful, disorganized, and, relatedly, innovative. Bureaucracy desperately wants legibility so that the rules are followed, the processes perform, and the bureaucrat's life is made easy. Building systems that support decentralized workflows and individual decisions, without getting in the way, is hard. And letting people be people can be frustrating when it's causing you headaches. We'll never build  systems that support an authentic, operationalized digital existence until we stop trying to fit people's decentralized lives into our neat, ordered, legible software.

<blockquote> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0300078153/windleyofente-20">Seeing like a State: How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed by James C. Scott</a> <p>In this wide-ranging and original book, James C. Scott analyzes failed cases of large-scale authoritarian plans in a variety of fields. Centrally managed social plans misfire, Scott argues, when they impose schematic visions that do violence to complex interdependencies that are not—and cannot—be fully understood. Further, the success of designs for social organization depends upon the recognition that local, practical knowledge is as important as formal, epistemic knowledge. The author builds a persuasive case against "development theory" and imperialistic state planning that disregards the values, desires, and objections of its subjects. He identifies and discusses four conditions common to all planning disasters: administrative ordering of nature and society by the state; a "high-modernist ideology" that places confidence in the ability of science to improve every aspect of human life; a willingness to use authoritarian state power to effect large- scale interventions; and a prostrate civil society that cannot effectively resist such plans.</p><p></p></blockquote>

<p>I wrote this piece to read at my mother's memorial on Saturday, August 28. I don't want to lose it, so I'm posting it here, to my personal space.</p><p></p><p>This is terrifying to me, which is why I’ve decided to write something down. I can’t possibly hope to represent Ma well. Even finding a story to tell is incredibly hard because there are so many of them: a lifetime of happy stories from a childhood that always felt like a kind of wheatgerm-fueled adventure where we lived on our own terms in spite of what the world might have wanted from us.</p><p>I started calling her Ma as a term of endearment when I was an adult. “Mum” is too British; “Mom” doesn’t sound right coming out of my mouth. “Mom”. So I confess, I absolutely stole Ma from [our cousins] the Neales, who have similar accent difficulties, and who I admire in lots of ways.</p><p>But when we were growing up, I called her Debbie. We were a very respectful but non-hierarchical household: we called our parents by their first names, we were encouraged to take things apart and ask how things worked, and we were consulted on all kinds of things that children are not necessarily best-equipped to weigh in on - but we were trusted, and that was wonderful, and a reflection of how both my parents think and thought. It’s a mindset rooted in equality, growth, and learning.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So. What do I want you to know about Ma?</p><p>Everything. Or at least, quite a few things. But let’s start here:</p><p>I want you to know that she was really freaking smart.</p><p>In my line of work, which is working in product and engineering in the tech industry, people often say things like, “explain this like you were explaining it to your mother.” It’s obviously a completely sexist line of thinking, which is kind of a reflection of the tech industry to be honest, and I take great satisfaction in telling them that my mother taught me to program. Not only that, but she learned assembler, which is one of the most intricate ways to program.</p><p>She would sit patiently with me for hours on end, and together we’d plug source code into our 8-bit Atari. She taught me BASIC, and then later on, we moved on to more complicated languages together.</p><p>When we didn’t have the money to get the latest and greatest PC, she organized a computer club at a local business in Oxford so that I’d have access. Every Thursday night, a bunch of kids from across the city would play games, make art, learn to code, and become computer literate together under her gentle guidance.</p><p>She studied the telecommunications industry, and knew that both the internet and the mobile revolution were coming. She understood the implications, and spoke to many of the people who were making things happen. She wrote detailed analyses of the forces that would reshape much of society over the coming decades.</p><p>She took me with her to industry shows in Cannes, and as a family we went to technology conferences across Europe, where we’d go sightseeing (and I might sneak into an event or two) and she’d be running panels and conducting interviews.</p><p>She was unassuming about it; she wasn’t self-important, but if she’d been someone else, she could have become a billionaire.</p><p>Instead, she withdrew from the industry, retrained, became a middle school science teacher in one of the most impoverished towns in California, and never looked back. I don’t remember her as happy at work as when she was teaching those kids. Even when she started to get sick, she went into work every day with an oxygen tank on her back, looking like a Ghostbuster. Even when she couldn’t work anymore, she helped her school get grants and organized an educational program with NASA. She was dedicated and she loved it.</p><p>She would engage in debate about anything. It was common to see her and my dad watching a documentary or lecture on any number of obscure topics and discussing it late into the night and sometimes days later. She became fascinated by science and space. She could speak a bunch of languages and would read and analyze academic reports in languages she didn’t even know yet. She was well-read, and read voraciously - often with multiple books on the go at once, which even this year she’d alternate between during dialysis and while she was getting her tube feeds in bed - and was hungry for knowledge.</p><p>So, sure, I’ll explain it like I’m explaining it to my mother. I’ll include all the detail, know that she’ll understand the implications better than I will, and be ready for a series of informed, insightful questions - and to be, more than anything else, challenged on the ethics of it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What do I want you to know about Ma?</p><p>I want you to know that she cared. She wasn’t just kind and forgiving, willing to see the best in absolutely everyone and go out of her way to help - although she was definitely all of those things. But more than that, she really cared deeply: about people and the intricacies of their lives, about the world, and particularly about fairness.</p><p>Before I was born, both my parents were involved in struggles to support affirmative action and tenants’ rights. She described herself as having been radicalized early on, but it’s not particularly that she was radical: she could just see past the social templates that everyone is expected to adhere to, and which perpetuate systemic injustices, and could see how everything should operate to be fairer.</p><p>That was true on every level. She wanted she and Steve and Erica to all be treated equally, and would make it known if she thought the others were getting a raw deal. She tried her best to treat Hannah and I equally. If someone made a sexist or a homophobic remark around her, she would call it out. If someone was xenophobic, or unthinkingly imperialist, she would bring it up. She was outspoken - always with good humor, but always adamant about what really mattered.</p><p>Later in life, when she had a little bit more money, she gave to causes she believed in: representation for women, reproductive rights, racial justice, voting rights, and the environment. She was glued to the Presidential debates, appalled by the previous guy, and was completely on top of what was going on in the world.</p><p>She was a feminist, as we all should be. She defined her own identity, dressed as she wanted to dress, acted as she wanted to act, spoke how she wanted to speak. It wasn’t that she was irreverent towards more traditional expectations; they were utterly irrelevant. As they should be.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What do I want you to know about Ma?</p><p>I want you to know that she was herself - and that self was full of life and energy and humor and movement. And I’m not just talking about her amazing trousers.</p><p>The last time I was here at the Cape, which was three years ago, we were all hanging out in the pond behind Little Lane. For some reason, there was an inflatable bull out there with us. None of us could climb on top of it: Hannah, me, Anna, I think Rachel was there, Wiley, Elise.</p><p>Ma was weak, and the lung transplant drugs were taking their toll, and she was having trouble eating food. And when she started to climb onto that bull, I’ve got to admit, I was kind of worried.</p><p>But by god, climb she did, and she was the only one of us who made it to the top of that bull. And once she’d scrambled to the top of it, she lifted her arms up in victory.</p><p>That was Ma.</p><p>We realized later that she absolutely was not supposed to be in a closed body of water as an immunosuppressed person, but whatever. There were no ill effects. She climbed the bull.</p><p>She spent the last decade scrambling to the top of the biggest metaphorical inflatable bull you’ve ever heard of. And she spent most of that decade balancing precariously on top of it with her arms held high in victory.</p><p>When Pammy gifted us the Sunfish - the same boat that they had both sailed when they were younger - it was like a key to unlocking the bay. We spent days and days tacking around the bay, finding exactly the right breeze, and making our way back to Grandmother’s Beach at high speed in a single tack. She would yell: whooooooosh! And then we’d think about tacking back to Sagelots and doing it all again.</p><p>Life was always full of those small moments of joy. Taking Tessie, our little Jack Russell Terrier, out on Port Meadow and watching her bound through the tall grass. Going out to the wildlife sanctuary outside of Turlock and seeing the birds fly through the reeds. Sneaking out and stealing a dinghy late at night from Grandmother’s Beach and oohing at the phosphorescence shimmering around our oars. Getting out the sofabed and all sitting together under the covers to watch Doctor Who or a movie on a Friday night. Sitting around the table with people she loved, picking crabs.</p><p>When she got sick, life was still full of those moments of joy. Even just a five minute walk through the park had the same energy. Just a few months ago, she got out and walked the boardwalk at Monterey. “I still have life-force in me,” she told the doctors. She loved to live.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What do I want you to know about Ma?</p><p>One last thing for now. I actually have a message to impart. Not so long ago, while she was lying in a bed on the tenth floor at UCSF, surrounded by all the tubes and hospital paraphernalia, she gave me a simple instruction:</p><p>“Tell everyone I love them.”</p><p>And she did. She loved you so much. She loved all of us so much, in a way that was open, and forgiving, and kind, and all in her own way.</p><p>I’m really glad you’re all here. She would be glad too. She was hoping to be with you all one more time.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p></p>

<p>This article shows how to improve the security of an ASP.NET Core Web API application by adding security headers to all HTTP API responses. The security headers are added using the <a href="https://github.com/andrewlock/NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders">NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders</a> Nuget package from <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewlocknet">Andrew Lock</a>. The headers are used to protect the session, not for authorization. The application uses Microsoft.Identity.Web to authorize the API requests. The security headers are used to protected the session.  Swagger is used in development and the CSP needs to be weakened to allow swagger to work during development. A strict CSP definition is used for the deployed environment.</p>

<p></p>



<p>The NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders Nuget package is added to the csproj file of the web applications. The Swagger Open API packages are added as well as the Microsoft.Identity.Web to protect the API using OAuth.</p>


  &lt;ItemGroup&gt;
	&lt;PackageReference 
		Include="Microsoft.Identity.Web" Version="1.15.2" /&gt;
	&lt;PackageReference 
		Include="IdentityModel.AspNetCore" Version="3.0.0" /&gt;
	&lt;PackageReference 
		Include="NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders" Version="0.16.0" /&gt;
	&lt;PackageReference 
		Include="Swashbuckle.AspNetCore" Version="6.1.4" /&gt;
	&lt;PackageReference 
		Include="Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.Annotations" Version="6.1.4" /&gt;
&lt;/ItemGroup&gt;
  


<p>The security header definitions are added using the HeaderPolicyCollection class. I added this to a separate class to keep the Startup class small where the middleware is added. I passed a boolean parameter into the method which is used to add or remove the HSTS header and create a CSP policy depending on the environment. </p>



<p></p>


  public static HeaderPolicyCollection GetHeaderPolicyCollection(bool isDev)
{
	var policy = new HeaderPolicyCollection()
		.AddFrameOptionsDeny()
		.AddXssProtectionBlock()
		.AddContentTypeOptionsNoSniff()
		.AddReferrerPolicyStrictOriginWhenCrossOrigin()
		.RemoveServerHeader()
		.AddCrossOriginOpenerPolicy(builder =&gt;
		{
			builder.SameOrigin();
		})
		.AddCrossOriginEmbedderPolicy(builder =&gt;
		{
			builder.RequireCorp();
		})
		.AddCrossOriginResourcePolicy(builder =&gt;
		{
			builder.SameOrigin();
		})
		.RemoveServerHeader()
		.AddPermissionsPolicy(builder =&gt;
		{
			builder.AddAccelerometer().None();
			builder.AddAutoplay().None();
			builder.AddCamera().None();
			builder.AddEncryptedMedia().None();
			builder.AddFullscreen().All();
			builder.AddGeolocation().None();
			builder.AddGyroscope().None();
			builder.AddMagnetometer().None();
			builder.AddMicrophone().None();
			builder.AddMidi().None();
			builder.AddPayment().None();
			builder.AddPictureInPicture().None();
			builder.AddSyncXHR().None();
			builder.AddUsb().None();
		});

	AddCspHstsDefinitions(isDev, policy);

	return policy;
}
  


<p>The AddCspHstsDefinitions defines different policies using the parameter. In development, the HSTS header is not added to the headers and a weak CSP is used so that the Swagger UI will work. This UI uses unsafe inline Javascript and needs to be allowed in development. I remove swagger from all non dev deployments due to this and force a strong CSP definition then.</p>


  private static void AddCspHstsDefinitions(bool isDev, HeaderPolicyCollection policy)
{
	if (!isDev)
	{
		policy.AddContentSecurityPolicy(builder =&gt;
		{
			builder.AddObjectSrc().None();
			builder.AddBlockAllMixedContent();
			builder.AddImgSrc().None();
			builder.AddFormAction().None();
			builder.AddFontSrc().None();
			builder.AddStyleSrc().None();
			builder.AddScriptSrc().None();
			builder.AddBaseUri().Self();
			builder.AddFrameAncestors().None();
			builder.AddCustomDirective("require-trusted-types-for", "'script'");
		});
		// maxage = one year in seconds
		policy.AddStrictTransportSecurityMaxAgeIncludeSubDomains
          (maxAgeInSeconds: 60 * 60 * 24 * 365);
	}
	else
	{
		// allow swagger UI for dev
		policy.AddContentSecurityPolicy(builder =&gt;
		{
			builder.AddObjectSrc().None();
			builder.AddBlockAllMixedContent();
			builder.AddImgSrc().Self().From("data:");
			builder.AddFormAction().Self();
			builder.AddFontSrc().Self();
			builder.AddStyleSrc().Self().UnsafeInline();
			builder.AddScriptSrc().Self().UnsafeInline(); //.WithNonce();
			builder.AddBaseUri().Self();
			builder.AddFrameAncestors().None();
		});
	}
}
  


<p>In the Startup class, the UseSecurityHeaders method is used to apply the HTTP headers policy and add the middleware to the application. The env.IsDevelopment() is used to add or not to add the HSTS header. The default HSTS middleware from the ASP.NET Core templates was removed from the Configure method as this is not required.   The UseSecurityHeaders is added before the swagger middleware so that the security headers are deployment to all environments.</p>


  public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
	app.UseSecurityHeaders(
		SecurityHeadersDefinitions.GetHeaderPolicyCollection(env.IsDevelopment()));

	if (env.IsDevelopment())
	{
		app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();

		app.UseSwagger();
		app.UseSwaggerUI(c =&gt;
		{
			c.SwaggerEndpoint("/swagger/v1/swagger.json", "API v1");
		});
	}
  


<p>The server header can be removed in the program class if using Kestrel. If using IIS, you probably need to use the web.config to remove this. </p>


  public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =&gt;
            Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
                .ConfigureWebHostDefaults(webBuilder =&gt;
                {
                    webBuilder
                        .ConfigureKestrel(options =&gt; options.AddServerHeader = false)
                        .UseStartup&lt;Startup&gt;();
                });
  


<p>Running the application using a non development environment, the securtiyheaders.com check returns good results. Everything is closed as this is an API with no UI. </p>







<p>And the <a href="https://csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com/">https://csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com/</a> check returns a very possible evaluation of the headers. </p>







<p>If a swagger UI is required, the API application can be run in the development environment. This could also be deployed if required, but in a production deployment, you probably don’t need this.</p>







<p>To support the swagger UI, a weakened CSP is used and the <a href="https://csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com/">https://csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com/</a> check returns a more negative result.</p>



<p></p>







<p>Notes:</p>



<p>I block all traffic, if possible, which is not from my domain including sub domains. If implementing enterprise applications, I would always do this. If implementing public facing applications with high traffic volumes or need extra fast response times, or need to reduce the costs of hosting, then CDNs would need to be used, allowed and so on. Try to block all first and open up as required and maybe you can avoid some nasty surprises from all the Javascript, CSS frameworks used.</p>

  <p>This week I started experimenting with a desktop application version of <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a> - with the goal of providing people who aren't comfortable with the command-line the ability to get Datasette up and running on their own personal computers.</p>
<p></p>
 Why a desktop application? 
<p>On Monday I <a href="https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1429931719587598346">kicked off an enormous Twitter conversation</a> when I posted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wonder how much of the popularity of R among some communities in comparison to Python comes down to the fact that with R you can install the RStudio desktop application and you're ready to go</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This ties into my single biggest complaint about Python: it's just too hard for people to get started with. Setting up a Python development environment for the first time remains an enormous barrier to entry.</p>
<p>I later put this <a href="https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1429937655450505248">in stronger terms</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The more I think about this the more frustrated I get, thinking about the enormous amount of human potential that's squandered because the barriers to getting started learning to program are so much higher than they need to be</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which made me think of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Those_who_live_in_glass_houses_should_not_throw_stones">glass houses</a>. My own <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a> project has exactly the same problem: to run it locally you need to install Python and then install Datasette! Mac users <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/installation.html">can use Homebrew</a>, but telling newcomers to install Homebrew first isn't particularly welcoming either.</p>
<p>Ideally, I'd like people to be able to install a regular desktop application and start using Datasette that way, without even needing to know that it's written in Python.</p>
<p>There's been <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/93">an open issue</a> to get Datasette running as a standalone binary using PyInstaller since November 2017, with quite a bit of research.</p>
<p>But I want a UI as well: I don't want to have to teach new users how to install and run a command-line application if I can avoid it.</p>
<p>So I decided to spend some time researching <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">Electron</a> to see how hard it would be to make a basic Datasette desktop application a reality.</p>
 Progress so far 
<p>The code I've written so far can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette.app">simonw/datasette.app</a> repository on GitHub. The app so far does the following:</p>
 
 Run a <code>datasette</code> server on localhost attached to an available port (found using <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/portfinder">portfinder</a>) which terminates when the app quits. 
 Open a desktop window showing that Datasette instance once the server has started. 
 Allow additional windows onto the same instance to be opened using the "New Window" menu option or the Command+N keyboard shortcut. 
 Provides an "Open Database..." menu option (and Command+O shortcut) which brings up a file picker to allow the user to select a SQLite database file to open - once selected, this is attached to the Datasette instance and any windows showing the Datasette homepage are reloaded. 
 
<p>Here's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n90Cg_9j9XE">a video demo</a> showing these features in action:</p>

<p>It's very much an MVP, but I'm encouraged by the progress so far. I think this is enough of a proof of concept to be worth turning this into an actual usable product.</p>
 How this all works 
<p>There are two components to the application.</p>
<p>The first is a thin Electron shell, responsible for launching the Python server, managing windows and configuring the various desktop menu options used to configure it. The code for that lives in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette.app/blob/4c968ec5b2b845c644c88425f2d43821cc63c4ff/main.js">main.js</a>.</p>
<p>The second is a custom Datasette plugin that adds extra functionality needed by the application. Currently this consists of a tiny bit of <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette.app/blob/4c968ec5b2b845c644c88425f2d43821cc63c4ff/datasette-app-support/datasette_app_support/static/sticky-footer.css">extra CSS</a> to make the footer stick to the bottom of the window, and a <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette.app/blob/4c968ec5b2b845c644c88425f2d43821cc63c4ff/datasette-app-support/datasette_app_support/__init__.py#L15-L56">custom API endpoint</a> at <code>/-/open-database-file</code> which is called by the menu option for opening a new database.</p>
 Initial impressions of Electron 
<p>I know it's cool to knock Electron, but in this case it feels like exactly the right tool for the job. Datasette is already a web application - what I need is a way to hide the configuration of that web application behind an icon, and re-present the interface in a way that feels more like a desktop application.</p>
<p>This is my first time building anything with Electron - here are some of my initial impressions.</p>
 
 The initial getting started workflow is really good. I started out with their <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/quick-start">Quick Start</a> and was up and running with a barebones application that I could start making changes to in just a few minutes. 
 The documentation is pretty good, but it leans more towards being an API reference. I found myself googling for examples of different things I wanted to do pretty often. 
 The automated testing situation isn't great. I'm using <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/spectron">Spectron</a> and <a href="https://mochajs.org/">Mocha</a> for <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette.app/blob/4c968ec5b2b845c644c88425f2d43821cc63c4ff/test/spec.js">my initial</a> (very thin) tests - I got them up and running in GitHub Actions, but I've already run into some limitations:
 
 For some reason each time I run the tests an Electron window (and <code>datasette</code> Python process) is left running. I can't figure out why this is. 
 There doesn't appear to be a way for tests to trigger menu items, which is frustrating because most of the logic I've written so far deals with menu items! There is an <a href="https://github.com/electron-userland/spectron/issues/21">open issue for this</a> dating back to May 2016. 
 
 
 I haven't yet managed to package my app. This is clearly going to be the biggest challenge. 
 
 Up next: packaging the app 
<p>I was hoping to get to this before writing up my progress in these weeknotes, but it looks like it's going to be quite a challenge.</p>
<p>In order to produce an installable macOS app (I'll dive into Windows later) I need to do the following:</p>
 
 Build a standalone Datasette executable, complete with the custom plugin, using PyInstaller 
 Sign that binary with an Apple developer certificate 
 Build an Electron application that bundles a copy of that <code>datasette</code> binary 
 Sign the resulting Electron application 
 
<p>I'm expecting figuring this out to be a long-winded and frustrating experience, which is more the fault of Apple than of Electron. I'm tracking my progress on this in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette.app/issues/7">issue #7</a>.</p>
 Datasette 0.59a2 
<p>I pushed out <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/releases/tag/0.59a2">a new alpha</a> of Datasette earlier this week, partly driven by work I was doing on <code>datasette.app</code>.</p>
<p>The biggest new feature in this release is a new plugin hook: <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/plugin_hooks.html#plugin-hook-register-commands">register_commands()</a> - which lets plugins add additional commands to Datasette, e.g. <code>datasette verify name-of-file.db</code>.</p>
<p>I released a new plugin that exercises this hook called <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-verify">datasette-verify</a>. Past experience has shown me that it's crucial to ship an example plugin alongside a new hook, to help confirm that the hook design is fit for purpose.</p>
<p>It turns out I didn't need this for <code>datasette.app</code> after all, but it's still a great capability to have!</p>
 sqlite-utils 3.17 
<p>Quoting the <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v3-17">release notes</a> in full:</p>
<blockquote>
 
 The <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/cli.html#cli-memory">sqlite-utils memory</a> command has a new <code>--analyze</code> option, which runs the equivalent of the <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/cli.html#cli-analyze-tables">analyze-tables</a> command directly against the in-memory database created from the incoming CSV or JSON data. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils/issues/320">#320</a>) 
 
<a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/cli.html#cli-insert-files">sqlite-utils insert-files</a> now has the ability to insert file contents in to <code>TEXT</code> columns in addition to the default <code>BLOB</code>. Pass the <code>--text</code> option or use <code>content_text</code> as a column specifier. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils/issues/319">#319</a>) 
 
</blockquote>
 evernote-to-sqlite 0.3.2 
<p>As a follow-up to <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Aug/22/weeknotes-dogsheep/">last week's work</a> on my personal Dogsheep, I decided to re-import my Evernote notes... and found out that Evernote has changed their export mechanism in ways that broke my tool. Most concerningly their exported XML is <a href="https://github.com/dogsheep/evernote-to-sqlite/issues/13">even less well-formed than it used to be</a>. This <a href="https://github.com/dogsheep/evernote-to-sqlite/releases/tag/0.3.2">new release</a> works around that.</p>

   GitHub repository templates were introduced a couple of years ago to provide a mechanism for creating a brand new GitHub repository starting with an initial set of files.

<div class='wrap'>

  <p>GitHub repository templates were <a href="https://github.blog/2019-06-06-generate-new-repositories-with-repository-templates/">introduced a couple of years ago</a> to provide a mechanism for creating a brand new GitHub repository starting with an initial set of files.</p>
<p>They have one big limitation: the repositories that they create share the exact same contents as the template repository. They're basically a replacement for duplicating an existing folder and using that as the starting point for a new project.</p>
<p>I'm a big fan of the Python <a href="https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/">cookiecutter</a> tool, which provides a way to dynamically create new folder structures from user-provided variables using Jinja templates to generate content.</p>
<p>This morning, inspired by <a href="https://github.com/rochacbruno/python-project-template">this repo</a> by Bruno Rocha, I finally figured out a neat pattern for combining cookiecutter with repository templates to compensate for that missing dynamic content ability.</p>
<p>The result: <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-plugin-template-repository">datasette-plugin-template-repository</a> for creating new Datasette plugins with a single click, <a href="https://github.com/simonw/python-lib-template-repository">python-lib-template-repository</a> for creating new Python libraries and <a href="https://github.com/simonw/click-app-template-repository">click-app-template-repository</a> for creating Click CLI tools.</p>
 Cookiecutter 
<p>I maintain three cookiecutter templates at the moment:</p>
 
 
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-plugin">simonw/datasette-plugin</a>, for creating new <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/writing_plugins.html">Datasette plugins</a>. I've used that one for dozens of plugins myself. 
 
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/click-app">simonw/click-app</a>, which generates a skeleton for a new <a href="https://click.palletsprojects.com/">Click-based</a> command-line tool. Many of my <a href="https://datasette.io/tools?q=to-sqlite">x-to-sqlite</a> tools were built using this. 
 
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/python-lib">simonw/python-lib</a>, for generating general-purpose Python libraries. 
 
<p>Having installed cookiecutter (<code>pip install cookiecutter</code>) each of these can be used like so:</p>
 <code>% cookiecutter gh:simonw/datasette-plugin
plugin_name []: visualize counties
description []: Datasette plugin for visualizing counties
hyphenated [visualize-counties]: 
underscored [visualize_counties]: 
github_username []: simonw
author_name []: Simon Willison
include_static_directory []: y
include_templates_directory []: 
</code> 
<p>Cookiecutter prompts for some variables defined in a <code>cookiecutter.json</code> file, then generates the project by evaluating the templates.</p>
<p>The challenge was: how can I run this automatically when a new repository is created from a GitHub repository template? And where can I get those variables from?</p>
 Bruno's trick: a self-rewriting repository 
<p>Bruno has a brilliant trick for getting this to run, exhibited by <a href="https://github.com/rochacbruno/python-project-template/blob/cec9c32ba007d633c4b9d26aad67889d1a6a5e9a/.github/workflows/rename_project.yml">this workflow YAML</a>. His workflow starts like this:</p>
  name: Rename the project from template

on: [push]

jobs:
  rename-project:
    if: ${{ github.repository != 'rochacbruno/python-project-template' }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
       # ...  
<p>This means that his workflow only runs on copies of the original repository - the workflow is disabled in the template repository itself by that <code>if:</code> condition.</p>
<p>Then at the end of the workflow he does this:</p>
        - uses: stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action@v4
        with:
          commit_message: "Ready to clone and code"
          push_options: --force  
<p>This does a force push to replace the contents of the repository with whatever was generated by the rest of the workflow script!</p>
<p>This trick was exactly what I needed to get cookiecutter to work with repository templates.</p>
 Gathering variables using the GitHub GraphQL API 
<p>All three of my existing cookiecutter templates require the following variables:</p>
 
 A name to use for the generated folder 
 A one-line description to use in the README and in <code>setup.py</code>
 
 The GitHub username of the owner of the package 
 The display name of the owner 
 
<p>I need values for all of these before I can run cookiecutter.</p>
<p>It turns out they are all available from the GitHub GraphQL API, which can be called from the initial workflow copied from the repository template!</p>
<p>Here's the GitHub Actions step that does that:</p>
  - uses: actions/github-script@v4
  id: fetch-repo-and-user-details
  with:
    script: |
      const query = `query($owner:String!, $name:String!) {
        repository(owner:$owner, name:$name) {
          name
          description
          owner {
            login
            ... on User {
              name
            }
            ... on Organization {
              name
            }
          }
        }
      }`;
      const variables = {
        owner: context.repo.owner,
        name: context.repo.repo
      }
      const result = await github.graphql(query, variables)
      console.log(result)
      return result  
<p>Here I'm using the <a href="https://github.com/actions/github-script">actions/github-script</a> action, which provides a pre-configured, authenticated instance of GitHub's <a href="https://octokit.github.io/rest.js">octokit/rest.js</a> JavaScript library. You can then provide custom JavaScript that will be executed by the action.</p>
<p><code>await github.graphql(query, variables)</code> can then execute a GitHub GraphQL query. The query I'm using here gives me back the currenty repository's <code>name</code> and <code>description</code> and the <code>login</code> and display name of the owner of that repository.</p>
<p>GitHub repositories can be owned by either a user or an organization - the <code>... on User</code> / <code>... on Organization</code> syntax provides the same result here for both types of nested object.</p>
<p>The output of this GraphQL query looks something like this:</p>
  {
  "repository": {
    "name": "datasette-verify",
    "description": "Verify that files can be opened by Datasette",
    "owner": {
      "login": "simonw",
      "name": "Simon Willison"
    }
  }
}  
<p>I assigned an <code>id</code> of <code>fetch-repo-and-user-details</code> to that step of the workflow, so that the <code>return</code> value from the script could be accessed as JSON in the next step.</p>
 Passing those variables to cookiecutter 
<p>Cookiecutter defaults to asking for variables interactively, but it also supports passing in those variables as command-line parameters.</p>
<p>Here's part of my next workflow steps that executes cookiecutter using the variables collected by the GraphQL query:</p>
  - name: Rebuild contents using cookiecutter
  env:
    INFO: ${{ steps.fetch-repo-and-user-details.outputs.result }}
  run: |
    export REPO_NAME=$(echo $INFO | jq -r '.repository.name')
    # Run cookiecutter
    cookiecutter gh:simonw/python-lib --no-input \
      lib_name=$REPO_NAME \
      description="$(echo $INFO | jq -r .repository.description)" \
      github_username="$(echo $INFO | jq -r .repository.owner.login)" \
      author_name="$(echo $INFO | jq -r .repository.owner.name)"  
<p>The <code>env: INFO:</code> block exposes an environment variable called <code>INFO</code> to the step, populated with the output of the previous <code>fetch-repo-and-user-details</code> step - a string of JSON.</p>
<p>Then within the body of the step I use <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a> to extract out the details that I need - first the repository name:</p>
 <code>export REPO_NAME=$(echo $INFO | jq -r '.repository.name')
</code> 
<p>Then I pass the other details directly to cookiecutter as arguments:</p>
 <code>cookiecutter gh:simonw/python-lib --no-input \
  lib_name=$REPO_NAME \
  description="$(echo $INFO | jq -r .repository.description)" \
  github_username="$(echo $INFO | jq -r .repository.owner.login)" \
  author_name="$(echo $INFO | jq -r .repository.owner.name)"
</code> 
<p><code>jq -r</code> ensures that the raw text value is returned by <code>jq</code>, as opposed to the JSON string value which would be wrapped in double quotes.</p>
 Cleaning up at the end 
<p>Running cookiecutter in this way creates a folder within the root of the repository that duplicates the repository name, something like this:</p>
 <code>datasette-verify/datasette-verify
</code> 
<p>I actually want the contents of that folder to live in the root, so the next step I run is:</p>
 <code>mv $REPO_NAME/* .
mv $REPO_NAME/.gitignore .
mv $REPO_NAME/.github .
</code> 
<p>Here's <a href="https://github.com/simonw/python-lib-template-repository/blob/45869a9156aa3c2ab95bf1b985151d1d51719c1f/.github/workflows/cookiecutter.yml">my completed workflow</a>.</p>
<p>This almost worked - but when I tried to run it for the first time I got this error:</p>
<p><code>![remote rejected] (refusing to allow an integration to create or update .github/workflows/publish.yml)</code></p>
<p>It turns out the credentials provided to GitHub Actions are forbidden from making modifications to their own workflow files!</p>
<p>I can understand why that limitation is in place, but it's frustrating here. For the moment, my workaround is to do this just before pushing the final content back to the repository:</p>
 <code>mv .github/workflows .github/rename-this-to-workflows
</code> 
<p>I leave it up to the user to rename that folder back again when they want to enable the workflows that have been generated for them.</p>
 Give these a go 
<p>I've set up two templates using this pattern now:</p>
 
 
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-plugin-template-repository">datasette-plugin-template-repository</a> for creating new Datasette plugins - <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-plugin-template-repository/generate">use this template</a>
 
 
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/python-lib-template-repository">python-lib-template-repository</a> for creating new Python libraries - <a href="https://github.com/simonw/python-lib-template-repository/generate">use this template</a>
 
 
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/click-app-template-repository">click-app-template-repository</a> for creating new Python Click CLI tools - <a href="https://github.com/simonw/click-app-template-repository/generate">use this template</a>
 
 
<p>Both of these work the same way: enter a repository name and description, click "Create repository from template" and watch as GitHub copies the new repository and then, a few seconds later, runs the workflow to execute the cookiecutter template to replace the contents with the final result.</p>
<p>You can see examples of repositories that I created using these templates here:</p>

<p>In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/07/27/working-with-postgres-types/">Working with Postgres types</a> I showed an example of a materialized view that depends on a typed set-returning function. Because Postgres knows about that dependency, it won’t allow DROP FUNCTION foo. Instead it requires DROP FUNCTION foo CASCADE.</p>
<p>A similar thing happens with materialized views that depend on tables or other materialized views. Let’s build a cascade of views and consider the implications.</p>
 create materialized view v1 as (
  select 
    1 as number,
    'note_count' as label 
);
SELECT 1

select * from v1;

number | label
-------+-------
     1 | note_count
 
<p>Actually, before continuing the cascade, let’s linger here for a moment. This is a table-like object created without using CREATE TABLE and without explicitly specifying types. But Postgres knows the types.</p>
 \d v1;

Materialized view "public.v1"

Column  | Type 
--------+-----
number  | integer
label   | text
 
<p>The read-only view can become a read-write table like so.</p>
 create table t1 as (select * from v1);
SELECT 1

select * from t1;

number | label
-------+-------
     1 | note_count

\d t1

Table "public.v1"

Column  | Type 
--------+-----
number  | integer
label   | text
 
<p>This ability to derive a table from a materialized view will come in handy later. It’s also just interesting to see how the view’s implicit types become explicit in the table.</p>
<p>OK, let’s continue the cascade.</p>
 create materialized view v2 as (
  select 
    number + 1,
    label
  from v1
);
SELECT 1

select * from v2;

number | label
-------+-------
     2 | note_count

create materialized view v3 as (
  select 
    number + 1,
    label
  from v2
);
SELECT 1

select * from v3;

number | label
-------+-------
     3 | note_count
 
<p>Why do this? Arguably you shouldn’t. Laurenz Albe makes that case in <a href="https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/tracking-view-dependencies-in-postgresql/">Tracking view dependencies in PostgreSQL</a>. Recognizing that it’s sometimes useful, though, he goes on to provide code that can track recursive view dependencies. </p>
<p>I use cascading views advisedly to augment the use of CTEs and functions described in <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/08/21/postgres-functional-style/">Postgres functional style</a>. Views that refine views can provide a complementary form of the chunking that aids reasoning in an analytics system. But that’s a topic for another episode. In this episode I’ll describe a problem that arose in a case where there’s only a single level of dependency from a table to a set of dependent materialized views, and discuss my solution to that probem.</p>
<p>Here’s the setup. We have an annotation table that’s reloaded nightly. On an internal dashboard we have a chart based on the materialized view annos_at_month_ends_for_one_year which is derived from the annotation table and, as its name suggests, reports annotation counts on a monthly cycle. At the beginning of the nightly load, this happens: DROP TABLE annotation CASCADE. So the derived view gets dropped and needs to be recreated as part of the nightly process. But that’s a lot of unnecessary work for a chart that only changes monthly.</p>
<p>Here are two ways to protect a view from a cascading drop of the table it depends on. Both reside in a SQL script, monthly.sql, that only runs on the first of every month. First, annos_at_month_ends_for_one_year.</p>
 drop materialized view annos_at_month_ends_for_one_year;
create materialized view annos_at_month_ends_for_one_year as (
  with last_days as (
    select 
      last_days_of_prior_months( 
        date(last_month_date() - interval '6 year')
      ) as last_day
    ),
    monthly_counts as (
      select
        to_char(last_day, '_YYYY-MM') as end_of_month,
        anno_count_between( 
          date(last_day - interval '1 month'), last_day
        ) as monthly_annos
      from last_days
    )
    select
      end_of_month,
      monthly_annos,
      sum(monthly_annos) over 
        (order by end_of_month asc rows 
           between unbounded preceding and current row
        ) as cumulative_annos
    from monthly_counts
) with data;
 
<p>Because this view depends indirectly on the annotation table  — by way of the function anno_count_between — Postgres doesn’t see the dependency. So the view isn’t affected by the cascading drop of the annotation table. It persists until, once a month, it gets dropped and recreated.</p>
<p>What if you want Postgres to know about such a dependency, so that the view will participate in a cascading drop? You can do this.</p>
 create materialized view annos_at_month_ends_for_one_year as (
  with depends as (
    select * from annotation limit 1
  )
  last_days as (
    ),
  monthly_counts as (
    )
  select
    *
  from monthly_counts;
 
<p>The depends CTE doesn’t do anything relevant to the query, it just tells Postgres that this view depends on the annotation table.</p>
<p>Here’s another way to protect a view from a cascading drop. This expensive-to-build view depends directly on the annotation table but only needs to be updated monthly. So in this case, cumulative_annotations is a table derived from a temporary materialized view.</p>
 create materialized view _cumulative_annotations as (
  with data as (
    select 
      to_char(created, 'YYYY-MM') as created
    from annotation
    group by created
  ) 
  select 
    data.created, 
    sum(data.count) 
      over ( 
        order by data.created asc 
        rows between unbounded preceding and current row
      )
    from data
    group by data.created 
    order by data.created 

drop table cumulative_annotations;

create table cumulative_annotations as (
  select * from _cumulative_annotations
);

drop materialized view _cumulative_annotations;
 
<p>The table cumulative_annotations is only rebuilt once a month. It depends indirectly on the annotation table but Postgres doesn’t see that, so doesn’t include it in the cascading drop.</p>
<p>Here’s the proof.</p>
 -- create a table
create table t1 (number int);

insert into t1 (number) values (1);
INSERT 0 1

select * from t1;

number
-------
     1

-- derive a view from t1
create materialized view v1 as (select * from t1);
SELECT 1

select * from v1

number
-------
     1

-- try to drop t1
drop table t1;

ERROR: cannot drop table t1 because other objects depend on it
DETAIL: materialized view v1 depends on table t1
HINT: Use DROP ... CASCADE to drop the dependent objects too.

-- derive an independent table from t1 by way of a matview
drop materialized view v1;

create materialized view v1 as (select * from t1);
SELECT 1

create table t2 as (select * from v1);
SELECT 1

-- drop the matview
drop materialized view v1;

-- drop t1
drop table t1;

-- no complaint, and t2 still exists
select * from t2;

number
-------
     1
 
<p>These are two ways I’ve found to protect a long-lived result set from the cascading drop of a short-lived table on which it depends. You can hide the dependency behind a function, or you can derive an independent table by way of a transient materialized view. I use them interchangeably, and don’t have a strong preference one way or another. Both lighten the load on the analytics server. Materialized views (or tables) that only need to change weekly or monthly, but were being dropped nightly by cascade from core tables, are now recreated only on their appropriate weekly or monthly cycles.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>In this series I’m exploring how to work in a code base that lives in two places: Metabase questions that encapsulate chunks of SQL, and Postgres functions/procedures/views that also encapsulate chunks of SQL. To be effective working with this hybrid collection of SQL chunks, I needed to reason about their interrelationships. One way to do that entailed the creation of a documentation generator that writes a concordance of callers and callees.</p>
<p>Here’s the entry for the function sparklines_for_guid(_guid).</p>
<p></p>
<p>The called by column says that this function is called from two different contexts. One is a Metabase question, All courses: Weekly activity. If you’re viewing that question in Metabase, you’ll find that its SQL text is simply this:</p>
 select * from sparklines_for_guid( {{guid}} )
 
<p>The same function call appears in a procedure, cache warmer, that preemptively memoizes the function for a set of the most active schools in the system. In either case, you can look up the function in the concordance, view its definition, and review how it’s called.</p>
<p>In the definition of sparkline_for_guid, names of other functions (like guid_hashed_view_exists) appear and are linked to their definitions. Similarly, names of views appearing in SELECT or JOIN contexts are linked to their definitions. </p>
<p>Here’s the entry for the function guid_hashed_view_exists. It is called by sparklines_for_guid as well as by functions that drive panels on the school dashboard. It links to the functions it uses: hash_for_guid and exists_view. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Here’s the entry for the view lms_course_groups which appears as a JOIN target in sparklines_for_guid. This central view is invoked — in SELECT or JOIN context — from many functions, from dependent views, and from Metabase questions. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Metabase questions can also “call” other Metabase questions. In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/07/21/a-virtuous-cycle-for-analytics/">A virtuous cycle for analytics</a> I noted: “Queries can emit URLs in order to compose themselves with other queries.” Here’s an example of that.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This Metabase question (985) calls various linked functions, and is called by two other Metabase questions. Here is one of those.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Because this Metabase question (600) emits an URL that refers to 985, it links to the definition of 985. It also links to the view, top_annotated_domains_last_week, from which it SELECTs.</p>
<p>It was straightforward to include Postgres functions, views, and procedures in the concordance since these live in files that reside in the fileystem under source control. Metabase questions, however, live in a database — in our case, a Postgres database that’s separate from our primary Postgres analytics db. In order to extract them into a file I use this SQL snippet.</p>
 select
  r.id,
  m.name as dbname,
  r.name,
  r.description,
  r.dataset_query
from report_card r
join metabase_database m
  on m.id = cast(r.dataset_query::jsonb-&gt;&gt;'database' as int)
where not r.archived
order by r.id;
 
<p>The doc generator downloads that Metabase data as a CSV file, queries.csv, and processes it along with the files that contain the definitions of functions, procedures, and views in the Postgres data warehouse. It also emits queries.txt which is a more convenient way to diff changes from one commit to the next. </p>
<p>This technique solved a couple of problems. First, when we were only using Metabase — unaugmented by anything in Postgres — it enabled us to put our Metabase SQL under source control and helped us visualize relationships among queries.</p>
<p>Later, as we augmented Metabase with Postgres functions, procedures, and views, it became even more powerful. Developing a new panel for a school or course dashboard means writing a new memoized function. That process begins as a Metabase question with SQL code that calls existing Postgres functions, and/or JOINs/SELECTs FROM existing Postgres views. Typically it then leads to the creation of new supporting Postgres functions and/or views. All this can be tested by internal users, or even invited external users, in Metabase, with the concordance available to help understand the relationships among the evolving set of functions and views.</p>
<p>When supporting functions and views are finalized, the SQL content of the Metabase question gets wrapped up in a memoized Postgres function that’s invoked from a panel of a dashboard app. At that point the concordance links the new wrapper function to the same set of supporting functions and views. I’ve found this to be an effective way to reason about a hybrid code base as features move from Metabase for prototyping to Postgres in production, while maintaining all the code under source control.</p>
<p>That foundation of source control is necessary, but maybe not sufficient, for a team to consider this whole approach viable. The use of two complementary languages for in-database programming will certainly raise eyebrows, and if it’s not your cup of tea I completely understand. If you do find it appealing, though, one thing you’ll wonder about next will be tooling. I work in VSCode nowadays, for which I’ve not yet found a useful extension for pl/pgsql or pl/python. With <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/08/13/pl-python-metaprogramming/">metaprogramming</a> life gets even harder for a aspiring pl/pgsql or pl/python VSCode extensions. I can envision them, but I’m not holding my breath awaiting them. Meanwhile, two factors enable VSCode to be helpful even without deep language-specific intelligence.</p>
<p>The first factor, and by far the dominant one, is outlining. In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2019/09/05/products-and-capabilities/">Products and capabilities</a> I reflect on how I’ve never adopted an outlining product, but often rely on outlining capability infused into a product. In VSCode that’s “only” basic indentation-driven folding and unfolding. But I find it works remarkably well across SQL queries, views and functions that embed them, CTEs that comprise them, and pl/pgsql or pl/python functions called by them. </p>
<p>The second factor, nascent thus far, is GitHub Copilot. It’s a complementary kind of language intelligence that’s aware of, but not bounded by, what a file extension of .sql or .py implies. It can sometimes discern patterns that mix language syntaxes and offer helpful suggestions. That hasn’t happened often so far, but it’s striking when it does. I don’t yet know the extent to which it may be <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/07/11/working-with-intelligent-machines/">training me while I train it</a>, or how those interactions might influence others. At this point I’m not a major Copilot booster, but I am very much an interested observer of and participant in the experiment.</p>
<p>All in all, I’m guardedly optimistic that existing or feasible tooling can enable individuals and teams to sanely navigate the hybrid corpus of source code discussed in this series. If you’re along for the ride, you’ll next wonder about debugging and monitoring a system built this way. That’s a topic for a future episode.</p>

   America has fallen; taken hostage by political cults, our once great bastion of "Individual Liberty" has fallen victim to the mobs ruled by media disinformation, inadequate education, and technical gerrymandering by algorithm. People have become operational devotees to artificial participatory groupings functioning as mobs of influence. This "devotion" to practice has yielded a system at odds with Constitutional integrity.  <br>  How did this happen?  <br>  Why did Individual people cede authority to a system that abstracts them into legal definitions out of step with observable reality? "We The People" no longer function as actual people, Individuals all. Instead, "We" are a legal abstraction duly represented by a Government once established "of, by, for people". This legalese slight of hand has manifested a bureaucratic system of artificial intelligence, and cult-based political control, wherein Individuals are regarded as a threat to stability.  <br>  People in the real world can observe that the only human beings they ever meet or come to know are all Individuals. It is our choices which form cults, our methods that make mobs. Once made, these are hard to unmake for any one person. For they exist to defy and destroy the integrity of Individual empowerment. Groups harvest people by consent, or manipulation, and the harvesting creates a new intent. Seeing clearly this new intent is useful in understanding how/why cults come into power.  <br>  In Government funded education, a cult of practice or pedagogy is limited by credentialed membership. The support of one cult member for another is advanced by a caring community of social influence all in harmony with the manner by which their credentialed membership is enforced, and employed. The unionization of labor within this cult of pedagogy further entrenches the practices and support structure that any student or family in any zip code can anticipate receiving education from. Where methods of functional literacy fall short due to rapidly evolving practices in the real world, the structure of practice and labor serves to enforce the pace of available change/progress offered to students and families.  <br>  Everyone can see this happening for themselves, and many Individual Teachers will openly and adamantly acknowledge this operational fact, and their support for the stability of labor value tied to their cult of practice is hard to argue with, for as people, they certainly deserve respect for their working efforts. This then is the point wherein the structural outcomes derived by cults begins its insidious assault on communities, cultures, Nations and people, Individuals all.  <br>  Cults are not made by "bad people". Cults are made by "bad choices". Enforcing bad choices is the problem of greatest consequence. Look around, where does the enforcement of bad choices come from? How is our civil Society being forced into bad choices that yield outcomes out of step with our intent as a people who create their own way, in life, liberty and the pursuits of happiness guaranteed by our Governing assemblage?&nbsp;  <br>  This is our enemy America.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.moxytongue.com/2020/08/kill-cult.html">People must kill the tendency towards cults.</a>  <br>  Cult rule never solves problems.. it just increases costs on infinite horizon of mass delusion for bureaucratic control.&nbsp;  <br>  Corporate bureaucracies extending from DOD, US CONGRESS, DOE, and every other department of every Federal and State Government all follow this same line of structural management by cult of practice. After retiring, contractors provide service of relationships between the same Government offices and personnel that they once worked with, enabling the efficient processing of opportunity by trust and devotion to a cult of practice. One political cult is elected and operational devotees arrive en masse to take their seats in the administrative machinery availed to their servicing mandates. With each Presidential election, this process can be experienced anew in Washington DC. A city emerges from the cults of influence that give operational meaning to time.&nbsp;  <br>  Taken to its extreme, the predictive outcomes that cult behaviors of practice/behavior/attention produce are easily harvested by propaganda-inducing algorithms used to influence mass sentiment. <a href="https://themarkup.org/citizen-browser/2021/08/10/how-the-daily-wire-uses-facebooks-targeted-advertising-to-build-its-brand">Advertising methods in social media systems</a> designed to produce cult behavior tendencies for ease of tracking attention and gaining access to social graphs where people influence one another as friends, brothers, sisters, daughters, sons, grandmas &amp; grandpas.. all for the purpose of producing cult outcomes for the predictable harvesting of management value. Any purpose, trackable cult behaviors. Any intent, trackable cult attention. Any manipulation, trackable cult influence.&nbsp;  <br>  Individual liberty that gives rise to a Nation and civil Society derived of, by, for people, Individuals all must be protected, at all costs. This is a structural requirement. People are not "people"; abstractions are not accurate enough. People are Individuals, and their operational participation is founded in the local mud, by the blood running through their veins for the integrity of their local community, culture and way of life.  <br>  Individual liberty has enemies, both well documented ones and new ones that appear from time to time. The Chinese Communist Party is one such enemy. Cults that remove Individual responsibility and induce group think are another. A systemic bureaucracy run by harvesting big data under surveillance technologies operating with artificial intelligence across time and space is another. These are insidious organizations of destructive intent, hell bent on capturing the loyalty of people, in lieu of allowing for actual free will expressed by people. Families must guard and protect the light of freedom found inside of each of us as people.&nbsp;  <br>  Bureaucracies around the world are racing towards the use of data aggregated for profound purposes, and are rapidly constituting a new type of "artificial intelligence" that is out of step with the inherent Rights of people, Individuals all.  <br>  Unless this aggregated effect of "We" is challenged to show its hand, to prove it exists to empower people, Individuals all, rather than replace them with an abstraction of literature or computer science &amp; engineering, everything that "We The People" hold dear will come to an end, replaced by a new version existing not "of, by, for" each of us, but instead.  <br>  The benefits of this transition will be cast broadly; Government-issued welfare benefits, a creator economy preying on the vanities of youth, and the destruction of work in favor of administration, delegation, crowdsourcing, and monetization of the cult attention graph. People will get rich for their compliant participation, while civil society gets weaker, less credulous, and more apt to extreme swings of behavior based on cult support for policies of the day.  <br>  You either stand for your Individual Rights, or you have none in the end. Standing means understanding how your Rights came to be, and how the source of your authority is the only protection you possess from cult rule. Mobs are spawning, and data aggregation via social-technical tools graphing the attention of people, and segmenting them by algorithm into easily targeted groups that can be harvested for financial and political gain is rampant. General data illiteracy is Nation-wide, around the entire globe. Political cults feed lies via media disinformation keeping people occupied trying to figure out how to be part of the group they agree with, most of the time.. some of the time.. today, for a specific reason.. always by cult association. Left cult, Right cult.. no people, no Individuals anywhere.  <br>  ID is the control parameter of freedom and security in a civil society. The source of your ID matters. In a civil society derived "of, by, for people", the source is obvious; ID comes from you.&nbsp;  <br>  Are you a database? Do you exist in a State Trust?  <br>  Rights are for people, not birth certificates. The law knows this, but it can not seem to figure out how to manifest this accurately without falsifying the inherent human authority required to resolve source integrity.  <br>  People own root. Individuals all, people are the source of Sovereign integrity, or there is none.  <br>  <a href="https://www.moxytongue.com/2012/02/what-is-sovereign-source-authority.html">Sovereign source authority</a> has been corrupted, and <a href="https://www.moxytongue.com/2021/07/recursive-signatory.html">only people can fix it in America</a>.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>

<p>A new project by FastAPI creator Sebastián Ramírez: SQLModel builds on top of both SQLAlchemy and Sebastián's Pydantic validation library to provide a new ORM that's designed around Python 3's optional typing. The real brilliance here is that a SQLModel subclass is simultaneously a valid SQLAlchemy ORM model AND a valid Pydantic validation model, saving on duplicate code by allowing the same class to be used both for form/API validation and for interacting with the database.</p>

<p>Fascinating article from 2017 describing how Discord migrated their primary message store to Cassandra (from MongoDB, but I could easily see them making the same decision if they had started with PostgreSQL or MySQL). The trick with scalable NoSQL databases like Cassandra is that you need to have a very deep understanding of the kinds of queries you will need to answer - and Discord had exactly that. In the article they talk about their desire to eventually migrate to Scylla (a compatible Cassandra alternative written in C++) - in the Hacker News comments they confirm that in 2021 they are using Scylla for a few things but they still have their core messages in Cassandra.</p>

  <p>Summary: An old apricot tree reminded me that life is wonderfully decentralized, helping it succeed in harsh conditions.</p>




<p>
    Last summer, I decided to kill this apricot tree. We weren't using the apricots, it was making a mess, and I wanted to do something else with the spot it's in. So, I cut off the branches, drilled holes in the stumps, and poured undiluted Round-Up into them. And yet, you'll notice that there's a spot on one branch that has sprouted shoots and leaves this summer. 
</p>

<p>
    My first thought was that the tree was struggling to live. But then, I realized that I was anthropomorphizing it. In fact, the tree has no higher brain function, it's not struggling to do anything. Instead, what the picture shows is the miracle of decentralization.
</p>

<p>
    Despite my overall success in killing the tree, some cells didn't get the message. They were able to source water and oxygen to grow. They didn't need permission or direction from central authority. They don't even know or care that they're part of a tree. The cells are programmed to behave in specific ways and conditions were such that the cells on that part of the branch were able to execute their programming. Left alone, they might even produce fruit and manage to reproduce. Amazing resiliance.
</p>

<p>
    I've <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/05/decentralized_system_in_a_box.shtml">written before about the decentralized behavior of bees</a>. Like the apricot tree, there is no higher brain function in a bee hive. Each bee goes about its work according to its programming. And yet, the result is a marvelously complex living organism (the hive) that is made up of tens of thousands of individual bees, each doing their own thing, but in a way that behaves consistently, reaches consensus about complex tasks, and achieves important goals.
</p>

<p>
    A few years ago, I read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00OD8Z4JW/windleyofente-20">The Vital Question by Nick Lane</a>. The book is a fascinating read about the way energy plays a vital role in how life develops and indeed how evolution progresses. I'm still in awe of the mechanisms necessary to provide energy for even a single-celled organism, let alone something as complex as a human being, a bee hive, or even an apricot tree.
</p>

<p>
    Life succeeds because it's terrifically decentralized. I find that miraculous. Humans have a tough time thinking about decentralized systems and designing them in ways that succeed. The current work in blockchains and interest in decentralization gives me hope that we'll design more systems that use decentralized methods to achieve their ends. The result will be an online world that is less fragile, perhaps even anti-fragile, than what we have now. 
</p>

<blockquote> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00OD8Z4JW/windleyofente-20">The Vital Question: Energy, Evolution, and the Origins of Complex Life by Nick Lane</a> <p>For two and a half billion years, from the very origins of life, single-celled organisms such as bacteria evolved without changing their basic form. Then, on just one occasion in four billion years, they made the jump to complexity. All complex life, from mushrooms to man, shares puzzling features, such as sex, which are unknown in bacteria. How and why did this radical transformation happen? The answer, Lane argues, lies in energy: all life on Earth lives off a voltage with the strength of a lightning bolt. Building on the pillars of evolutionary theory, Lane’s hypothesis draws on cutting-edge research into the link between energy and cell biology, in order to deliver a compelling account of evolution from the very origins of life to the emergence of multicellular organisms, while offering deep insights into our own lives and deaths.</p><p></p></blockquote>

<p>This article shows how to improve the security of an ASP.NET Core Blazor application by adding security headers to all HTTP Razor Page responses (Blazor WASM hosted in a ASP.NET Core hosted backend). The security headers are added using the <a href="https://github.com/andrewlock/NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders">NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders</a> Nuget package from <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewlocknet">Andrew Lock</a>. The headers are used to protect the session, not for authentication. The application is authenticated using OpenID Connect, the security headers are used to protected the session. The authentication is implemented in the Blazor application using the BFF pattern. The WASM client part is just a view of the server rendered trusted backend and cookies are used in the browser. All API calls are same domain only and protected with a cookie and same site.</p>

<p>The NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders and the NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders.TagHelpers Nuget packages are added to the csproj file of the web application. The tag helpers are added to use the nonce from the CSP in the Razor Pages.</p>


  &lt;ItemGroup&gt;
	&lt;PackageReference 
		Include="NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders" 
		Version="0.16.0" /&gt;
	&lt;PackageReference 
		Include="NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders.TagHelpers" 
		Version="0.16.0" /&gt;
&lt;/ItemGroup&gt;
  


<p>The Blazor definition is very similar to the ASP.NET Core Razor Page one. The main difference is that the CSP script policy is almost disabled due to the Blazor script requirements. We can at least force self on the content security policy header script-src definition.</p>



<p>The Blazor WASM logout link sends a HTTP Form POST request which is redirected to the OpenID Connect identity provider. The CSP needs to allow this redirect and the content secure policy form definition allows this.</p>


  public static HeaderPolicyCollection GetHeaderPolicyCollection(
     bool isDev, string identityProviderHost)
{
	var policy = new HeaderPolicyCollection()
		.AddFrameOptionsDeny()
		.AddXssProtectionBlock()
		.AddContentTypeOptionsNoSniff()
		.AddReferrerPolicyStrictOriginWhenCrossOrigin()
		.RemoveServerHeader()
		.AddCrossOriginOpenerPolicy(builder =&gt;
		{
			builder.SameOrigin();
		})
		.AddCrossOriginEmbedderPolicy(builder =&gt;
		{
			builder.RequireCorp();
		})
		.AddCrossOriginResourcePolicy(builder =&gt;
		{
			builder.SameOrigin();
		})
		.AddContentSecurityPolicy(builder =&gt;
		{
			builder.AddObjectSrc().None();
			builder.AddBlockAllMixedContent();
			builder.AddImgSrc().Self().From("data:");
			builder.AddFormAction().Self().From(identityProviderHost);
			builder.AddFontSrc().Self();
			builder.AddStyleSrc().Self().UnsafeInline();
			builder.AddBaseUri().Self();
			builder.AddFrameAncestors().None();

			// due to Blazor
			builder.AddScriptSrc().Self().UnsafeInline().UnsafeEval();
		})
		.RemoveServerHeader()
		.AddPermissionsPolicy(builder =&gt;
		{
			builder.AddAccelerometer().None();
			builder.AddAutoplay().None(); 
			builder.AddCamera().None();
			builder.AddEncryptedMedia().None();
			builder.AddFullscreen().All();
			builder.AddGeolocation().None();
			builder.AddGyroscope().None();
			builder.AddMagnetometer().None();
			builder.AddMicrophone().None();
			builder.AddMidi().None();
			builder.AddPayment().None();
			builder.AddPictureInPicture().None();
			builder.AddSyncXHR().None();
			builder.AddUsb().None();
		});

	if (!isDev)
	{
		// maxage = one year in seconds
		policy.AddStrictTransportSecurityMaxAgeIncludeSubDomains(maxAgeInSeconds: 60 * 60 * 24 * 365);
	}

	return policy;
}
  


<p>Blazor adds the following script to the WASM host file. This means the CSP for scripts cannot be implemented in a good way.</p>


  &lt;script&gt;
var Module; window.__wasmmodulecallback__(); delete window.__wasmmodulecallback__;
&lt;/script&gt;


  


<p>script-src (from CSP evaluator)</p>



<p>‘self’ can be problematic if you host JSONP, Angular or user uploaded files.<br>‘unsafe-inline’ allows the execution of unsafe in-page scripts and event handlers.<br>‘unsafe-eval’ allows the execution of code injected into DOM APIs such as eval().</p>



<p></p>



<p>The aspnetcore-browser-refresh.js is also added for hot reload. This also prevents a strong CSP script definition in development. This could be fixed with a dev check in the policy definition. There is no point fixing this, until the wasmmodulecallback script bug is fixed.</p>



<p>I am following the ASP.NET Core <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/34428">issue</a> and hope this can be improved for Blazor.</p>



<p></p>



<p>In the Startup class, the UseSecurityHeaders method is used to apply the HTTP headers policy and add the middleware to the application. The env.IsDevelopment() is used to add or not to add the HSTS header. The default HSTS middleware from the ASP.NET Core templates was removed from the Configure method as this is not required. </p>


  public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
	if (env.IsDevelopment())
	{
		app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
	}
	else
	{
		app.UseExceptionHandler("/Error");
	}

	app.UseSecurityHeaders(
		SecurityHeadersDefinitions
			.GetHeaderPolicyCollection(env.IsDevelopment(),
                    Configuration["AzureAd:Instance"]));
  


<p>The server header can be removed in the program class file of the Blazor server project if using Kestrel. If using IIS, you probably need to use the web.config to remove this.</p>


  public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =&gt;
	Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
		.ConfigureWebHostDefaults(webBuilder =&gt;
		{
			webBuilder
				.ConfigureKestrel(options =&gt; 
					options.AddServerHeader = false)
				.UseStartup&lt;Startup&gt;();
		});
  


<p>When we scan the <a href="https://securityheaders.com/">https://securityheaders.com/</a> you can view the results. You might need to disable the authentication to check this, or provide a public view.</p>







<p>The content security policy has a warning due to the script definition which is required for Blazor.</p>







<p>The <a href="https://csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com/">https://csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com/</a> also displays a high severity finding due the the CSP script definition.</p>







<p>Notes:</p>



<p>If the application is fully protected without any public views, the follow redirects checkbox on the security headers needs to be disabled as then you only get the results of the identity provider used to authenticate. </p>



<p>I block all traffic, if possible, which is not from my domain including sub domains. If implementing enterprise applications, I would always do this. If implementing public facing applications with high traffic volumes or need extra fast response times, or need to reduce the costs of hosting, then CDNs would need to be used, allowed and so on. Try to block all first and open up as required and maybe you can avoid some nasty surprises from all the Javascript, CSS frameworks used.</p>



<p>Maybe until the CSP script is fixed for Blazor, you probably should avoid using Blazor for high security applications and use ASP.NET Core Razor Page applications instead. </p>



<p>If you use Blazor together with tokens in Azure AD or Azure B2C and this CSP script bug, you leave yourself open to having your tokens stolen. I would recommend using server authentication with Azure which removes the tokens from the browser and also solves the Azure SPA logout problem. Azure AD, Azure B2C do not support the revocation endpoint or introspection, so it is impossible to invalidate your tokens on a logout. It does not help if the IT admin, Azure monitoring can invalidate tokens using CAE.</p>

    The rapid increase of COVID-19 cases among kids has shattered last year’s oft-repeated falsehood that kids don’t get COVID-19, and if they do, it’s not that bad. It was a convenient lie that was easy to believe in part because we kept most of our kids home. With remote learning not an option now, this year we’ll find out how dangerous this virus is for children in the worst way possible.   — Dan

  <p>I gave a talk about <a href="https://dogsheep.github.io/">Dogsheep</a> at Noisebridge's <a href="https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Five_Minutes_of_Fame_2021_08_19">Five Minutes of Fame</a> on Thursday. Just one problem: my regular Dogsheep demo was broken, so I ended up building it from scratch again. In doing so I fixed a few bugs in some Dogsheep tools.</p>
 Dogsheep on a Digital Ocean droplet 
<p>The latest iteration of my personal Dogsheep runs on a $20/month 4GB/2CPU <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a> Droplet running Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.</p>
<p>It runs a private Datasette instance and a bunch of cron jobs to fetch data from Twitter, GitHub, Foursquare Swarm, Pocket and Hacker News.</p>
<p>It also has copies of my Apple Photos and Apple HealthKit data which I upload manually - plus a <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2019/Sep/20/weeknotes-design-thinking-genome-sqlite/#genome-to-sqlite">copy of my genome</a> for good measure.</p>
<p>Some abbreviated notes on how I set it up, copied from a private GitHub Issues thread:</p>
 
 
<p>Create a new Ubuntu droplet, and configure its IP address as the A record for <code>dogsheep.simonwillison.net</code></p>
 
 
<p>Install Python 3 and NGINX and SQLite: <code>apt-get install python3 python3-venv nginx sqlite -y</code></p>
 
 
<p>Use <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">letsencrypt</a> to get an HTTPS certificate for it: <code>apt-get update</code> and then
<code>apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx -y</code>, then <code>certbot --nginx -d dogsheep.simonwillison.net</code></p>
 
 
<p>I had to remove the <code>ipv6only=on;</code> bit from the NGINX configuration due to <a href="https://github.com/certbot/certbot/issues/5550#issuecomment-367971137">this bug</a></p>
 
 
<p>Created a <code>dogsheep</code> user, <code>useradd -s /bin/bash -d /home/dogsheep/ -m -G</code></p>
 
 
<p>As that user, created a virtual environment: <code>python3 -mvenv datasette-venv</code> and then <code>datasette-venv/bin/pip install wheel</code> and <code>datasette-venv/bin/pip install datasette datasette-auth-passwords</code></p>
 
 
<p>Created a <code>/etc/systemd/system/datasette.service</code> file with <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/0653b6177c6f12caa16530da4c56646f">this contents</a></p>
 
 
<p>Created a set of blank SQLite database files <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/sqlite/enabling-wal-mode">in WAL mode</a> in <code>/home/dogsheep</code> using the following:</p>
 <code>for f in beta.db twitter.db healthkit.db github.db \
  swarm.db photos.db genome.db simonwillisonblog.db \
  pocket.db hacker-news.db memories.db
do
  sqlite3 $f vacuum
  # And enable WAL mode:
  sqlite3 $f 'PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL;'
done
</code> 
 
 
<p>Started the Datasette service: <code>service datasette start</code></p>
 
 
<p>Configured NGINX to proxy to localhost port 8001, using <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/deploying.html#nginx-proxy-configuration">this configuration</a></p>
 
 
<p>It's a few more steps than I'd like, but the end result was a <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-auth-passwords">password-protected</a> Datasette instance running against a bunch of SQLite database files on my new server.</p>
<p>With Datasette up and running, the next step was to start loading in data.</p>
 Importing my tweets 
<p>I started with Twitter. I dropped my Twitter API access credentials into an <code>auth.json</code> file (as <a href="https://datasette.io/tools/twitter-to-sqlite#user-content-authentication">described here</a>) and ran the following:</p>
 <code>source /home/dogsheep/datasette-venv/bin/activate
pip install twitter-to-sqlite
twitter-to-sqlite user-timeline /home/dogsheep/twitter.db \
  -a /home/dogsheep/auth.json
@simonw [###############################-----] 26299/29684 00:02:06
</code> 
<p>That pulled in all 29,684 of my personal tweets.</p>
<p>(Actually, first it broke with an error, exposing a <a href="https://github.com/dogsheep/twitter-to-sqlite/issues/57">bug that had already been reported</a>. I shipped <a href="https://github.com/dogsheep/twitter-to-sqlite/releases/tag/0.21.4">a fix for that</a> and tried again and it worked.)</p>
<p>Favourited tweets were a little harder - I have 39,904 favourited tweets, but the Twitter API only returns the most recent 3,200. I grabbed those more recent ones with:</p>
 <code>twitter-to-sqlite favorites /home/dogsheep/twitter.db \
  -a /home/dogsheep/auth.json
</code> 
<p>Then I requested <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/how-to-download-your-twitter-archive">my Twitter archive</a>, waited 24 hours and uploaded the resulting <code>like.js</code> file to the server, then ran:</p>
 <code>twitter-to-sqlite import twitter.db /tmp/like.js
</code> 
<p>This gave me an <code>archive_like</code> table with the data from that file - but it wasn't the full tweet representation, just the subset that Twitter expose in the archive export.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://datasette.io/tools/twitter-to-sqlite#user-content-importing-data-from-your-twitter-archive">README</a> shows how to inflate those into full tweets:</p>
 <code>twitter-to-sqlite statuses-lookup twitter.db \
  --sql='select tweetId from archive_like' \
  --skip-existing
Importing 33,382 tweets [------------------------------------] 0% 00:18:28
</code> 
<p>Once that was done I wrote additional records into the <code>favorited_by</code> table like so:</p>
 <code>sqlite3 twitter.db '
  INSERT OR IGNORE INTO favorited_by (tweet, user)
  SELECT tweetId, 12497 FROM archive_like
'
</code> 
<p>(12497 is my Twitter user ID.)</p>
<p>I also came up with a SQL view that lets me see just media attached to tweets:</p>
 <code>sqlite-utils create-view twitter.db media_details "
select
  json_object('img_src', media_url_https, 'width', 400) as img,
  tweets.full_text,
  tweets.created_at,
  tweets.id as tweet_id,
  users.screen_name,
  'https://twitter.com/' || users.screen_name || '/status/' || tweets.id as tweet_url
from
  media
  join media_tweets on media.id = media_tweets.media_id
  join tweets on media_tweets.tweets_id = tweets.id
  join users on tweets.user = users.id
order by
  tweets.id desc
"
</code> 
<p>Now I can visit <code>/twitter/media_details?_where=tweet_id+in+(select+tweet+from+favorited_by+where+user+=+12497)</code> to see the most recent media tweets that I've favourited!</p>
<p></p>
 Swarm checkins 
<p>Swarm checkins were a lot easier. I needed my previously-created Foursquare API token, and <a href="https://datasette.io/tools/swarm-to-sqlite">swarm-to-sqlite</a>:</p>
 <code>pip install swarm-to-sqlite
swarm-to-sqlite /home/dogsheep/swarm.db --token=...
</code> 
<p>This gave me a full table of my Swarm checkins, which I can visualize using <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-cluster-map">datasette-cluster-map</a>:</p>
<p></p>
 Apple HealthKit 
<p>I don't yet have full automation for my Apple HealthKit data (collected by my Apple Watch) or my Apple Photos - both require me to run scripts on my laptop to create the SQLite database file and then copy the result to the server via <code>scp</code>.</p>
<p><a href="https://datasette.io/tools/healthkit-to-sqlite">healthkit-to-sqlite</a> runs against the <code>export.zip</code> that is produced by the Apple Health app on the iPhone's export data button - for me that was a 158MB zip file which I AirDropped to my laptop and converted (after <a href="https://github.com/dogsheep/healthkit-to-sqlite/issues/19">fixing a new bug</a>) like so:</p>
 <code>healthkit-to-sqlite ~/Downloads/export.zip healthkit.db
Importing from HealthKit  [-----------------------------]    2%  00:02:25
</code> 
<p>I uploaded the resulting 1.5GB <code>healthkit.db</code> file and now I can do things like visualize my 2017 San Francisco Half Marathon run on a map:</p>
<p></p>
 Apple Photos 
<p>For my photos I use <a href="https://datasette.io/tools/dogsheep-photos">dogsheep-photos</a>, which I described last year in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/May/21/dogsheep-photos/">Using SQL to find my best photo of a pelican according to Apple Photos</a>. The short version: I run this script on my laptop:</p>
 <code># Upload original photos to my S3 bucket
dogsheep-photos upload photos.db \
  ~/Pictures/Photos\ Library.photoslibrary/originals
dogsheep-photos apple-photos photos.db \
  --image-url-prefix "https://photos.simonwillison.net/i/" \
  --image-url-suffix "?w=600"
scp photos.db dogsheep:/home/dogsheep/photos.db
</code> 
<p><code>photos.db</code> is only 171MB - it contains the metadata, including the machine learning labels, but not the photos themselves.</p>
<p>And now I can run queries for things like photos of food I've taken in 2021:</p>
<p></p>
 Automation via cron 
<p>I'm still working through the last step, which involves setting up cron tasks to refresh my data periodically from various sources. My <code>crontab</code> currently looks like this:</p>
 <code># Twitter

   SQLite: STRICT Tables (draft) 
 Draft documentation for a feature that sounds like it could be arriving in SQLite 3.37 (the next release) - adding a "STRICT" table-option keyword to a CREATE TABLE statement will cause the table to strictly enforce typing rules for data in that table, rejecting inserts that fail to match the column's datatypes.

<p>The OAuth 2.0 JWT-Secured Authorization Request (JAR) specification has been published as <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9101">RFC 9101</a>.  Among other applications, this specification is used by the <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-1_0.html">OpenID Financial-grade API (FAPI)</a>.  This is another in the series of RFCs bringing <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a>-defined functionality to OAuth 2.0.  Previous such RFCs included “OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol” [<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7591.html">RFC 7591</a>] and “OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata” [<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8414.html">RFC 8414</a>].</p>
<p>The abstract of the RFC is:</p>
<blockquote><p><br>
The authorization request in OAuth 2.0 described in RFC 6749 utilizes query parameter serialization, which means that authorization request parameters are encoded in the URI of the request and sent through user agents such as web browsers. While it is easy to implement, it means that a) the communication through the user agents is not integrity protected and thus, the parameters can be tainted, b) the source of the communication is not authenticated, and c) the communication through the user agents can be monitored. Because of these weaknesses, several attacks to the protocol have now been put forward.</p>
<p><br>
This document introduces the ability to send request parameters in a JSON Web Token (JWT) instead, which allows the request to be signed with JSON Web Signature (JWS) and encrypted with JSON Web Encryption (JWE) so that the integrity, source authentication, and confidentiality properties of the authorization request are attained. The request can be sent by value or by reference.<br>
</p></blockquote>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>My dual premises in this series are:</p>
<p>– Modern SQL is more valuable as a programming language than you might think (see Markus Winand’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEDZQtAHpX8">Modern SQL: A lot has changed since SQL-92</a>)</p>
<p>– Postgres is more valuable as a programming environment than you might think. (see R0ml Lefkowitz’s <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/01/24/the-image-of-postgres/">The Image of Postgres</a>)</p>
<p>As the patron saint of trailing edge technology it is my duty to explore what’s possible at the intersection of these two premises. The topic for this episode is Postgres functional style. Clearly what I’ve been doing with the combo of pl/python and pl/pgsql is very far from pure functional programming. The self-memoization technique shown in <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/08/19/postgres-set-returning-functions-that-self-memoize-as-materialized-views/What%20I%20showed">episode 7</a> is all about mutating state (ed: this means writing stuff down somewhere). But it feels functional to me in the broader sense that I’m using functions to orchestrate behavior that’s expressed in terms of SQL queries.</p>
<p>To help explain what I mean, I’m going to unpack one of the Postgres functions in our library. </p>
 count_of_distinct_lms_students_from_to(_guid text, _from date, _to date)
 
<p>This is a function that accepts a school id (aka guid), a start date, and an end date. Its job is to:</p>
<p>– Find all the courses (groups) for that school (guid)</p>
<p>– Filter to those created between the start and end date</p>
<p>– Find all the users in the filtered set of courses</p>
<p>– Filter to just students (i.e. omit instructors)</p>
<p>– Remove duplicate students (i.e., who are in more than one course)</p>
<p>– Return the count of distinct students at the school who annotated in the date range</p>
<p>The production database doesn’t yet store things in ways friendly to this outcome, so doing all this requires some heavy lifting in the analytics data warehouse. Here’s the function that orchestrates that work.</p>
 create function count_of_distinct_lms_students_from_to(_guid text, _from date, _to date) 
  returns bigint as $$
  declare count bigint;
  begin
 1  -- all groups active for the guid in the date range
 2  with groups as (
 3    select pubid from groups_for_guid(_guid)
 4    where group_is_active_from_to(pubid, _from, _to)
 5  ),
 6  -- usernames in those groups
 7  usernames_by_course as (
 8    select
 9      pubid,
10      (users_in_group(pubid)).username 
11  from groups 
12  ),
13  -- filtered to just students
14  students_by_course as (
15    select * from usernames_by_course
16    where not is_instructor(username, pubid)
17  )
18  select 
19    count (distinct username) 
20  from students_by_course
    into count;
    return count;
  end;
$$ language plpgsql;
 
<p>If you think pl/pgsql is old and clunky, then you are welcome to do this in pl/python instead. There’s negligible difference between how they’re written and how fast they run. It’s the same chunk of SQL either way, and it exemplifies the functional style I’m about to describe. </p>
<p>Two kinds of chunking work together here: CTEs (aka common table expressions, aka WITH clauses) and functions. If you’ve not worked with SQL for a long time, as I hadn’t, then CTEs may be unfamiliar. I think of them as pipelines of table transformations in which each stage of the pipeline gets a name. In this example those names are groups (line 2), usernames_by_course (line 7), and students_by_course (line 14). </p>
<p>The pipeline phases aren’t functions that accept parameters, but I still think of them as being function-like in the sense that they encapsulate named chunks of behavior. The style I’ve settled into aims to make each phase of the pipeline responsible for a single idea (“groups active in the range”, “usernames in those groups”), and to express that idea in a short snippet of SQL. </p>
<p>As I’m developing one of these pipelines, I test each phase. To test the first phase, for example, I’d do this in psql or Metabase.</p>
 -- all groups active for the guid in the date range
with groups as (
  select pubid from groups_for_guid('8anU0QwbgC2Cq:canvas-lms')
  where group_is_active_from_to(pubid, '2021-01-01', '2021-05-01')
)
select * from groups;
 
<p>And I’d spot-check to make sure the selected groups for that school really are in the date range. Then I’d check the next phase.</p>
 -- all groups active for the guid in the date range
with groups as (
),
-- usernames in those groups
usernames_by_course as (
  select
    pubid,
    (users_in_group(pubid)).username 
  from groups 
)
select * from usernames_by_course;
 
<p>After another sanity check against these results, I’d continue to the next phase, and eventually arrive at the final result. It’s the same approach I take with regular expressions. I am unable to visualize everything that’s happening in a complex regex. But I can reason effectively about a pipeline of matches that occur in easier-to-understand named steps.</p>
<p>Ideally each phase in one of these pipelines requires just a handful of lines of code: few enough to fit within the 7 +- 2 limit of working memory. Postgres functions make that possible. Here are the functions used in this 20-line chunk of SQL.</p>
<p>– groups_for_guid(guid): Returns a table of course ids for a school.</p>
<p>– group_is_active_from_to(pubid, _from, _to): Returns true if the group was created in the range.</p>
<p>– users_in_group(pubid): Returns a table of user info for a course.</p>
<p>– is_instructor(username, pubid): Returns true if that user is an instructor.</p>
<p>Two of these, groups_for_guid and users_in_group, are set-returning functions. As noted in <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/07/27/working-with-postgres-types/">Working with Postgres types</a>, they have the option of returning an explicit Postgres type defined elsewhere, or an implicit Postgres type defined inline. As it happens, both do the latter.</p>
 create or replace function groups_for_guid(_guid text)
  returns table(
    pubid text
  ) as $$
 
 create or replace function users_in_group (_pubid text)
  returns table (
    groupid text, 
    username text, 
    display_name text
  ) as $$
 
<p>The other two, group_is_active_from_to and is_instructor, return boolean values.</p>
<p>All this feels highly readable to me now, but the syntax of line 10 took quite a while to sink in. It helps me to look at what users_in_group(pubid) does in a SELECT context.</p>
 select * from users_in_group('4VzA92Yy')

groupid   | username    | display_name
----------+-------------+----------------
4VzA92Yy  | 39vA94AsQp  | Brendan Nadeau
 
<p>Here is an alternate way to write the usernames_by_course CTE at line 7.</p>
 -- usernames in those groups
usernames_by_course as (
  select
    g.pubid,
    u.username
from groups g 
join users_in_group(g.pubid) u on g.pubid = u.groupid
)
select * from usernames_by_course;
 
<p>Both do exactly the same thing in very close to the same amount of time. Having mixed the two styles I’m leaning toward the first, but you could go either way or both. What matters more is the mental leverage you wield when writing CTEs and functions together to compose pipelines of transformations, and that others wield when reading and debugging.</p>
<p>I hope I’ve made the case for writing and reading. There’s a case to be made for debugging too, but that’s another episode.</p>

To those impacted, T-mobile is offering a bandaid, a free&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mcafee.com/consumer/en-us/landing-page/direct/sem/mtp-family/desktop/brand-ad.html?csrc=google&amp;csrcl2=main-ad&amp;cctype=desktop-brand&amp;ccstype=&amp;ccoe=direct&amp;ccoel2=sem&amp;pkg_id=521&amp;affid=1485&amp;cid=238375&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=paidsearch&amp;utm_campaign=[EN-US][Search][Brand]%20Product%20Identity&amp;utm_content=[brand][exact]%20mcafee%20identity%20protection&amp;utm_term=mcafee%20identity%20protection&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwgviIBhBkEiwA10D2j--TK9X5qrO1R-yG_WAJ6T7DQBClC00w_FASFOljt-bhNtfpCOgVfRoCAuMQAvD_BwE">McAfee Identity Protection license</a>. Offering an identity protection monitoring service or similar bandaid following a breach is an industry-standard practice. The practice of offering the bandaid however provides little salve, what is even worse and unfortunate, as some action is better than nothing, is that most people don’t take advantage of it when it is offered<a href="http:/#fn1">1</a>.</p>
<p>Is T-Mobile’s offer a start? Yes. Is it enough? In my opinion, no. We need to do more. People worldwide are concerned for their privacy and data&nbsp;(Auxier et al., 2019; Langer et al., 2021); they have been for a long time&nbsp;(Warren &amp; Brandeis, 1890), and rightfully so as evidence by the fact that there have been more than 10,000 data breaches since 2005&nbsp;(2020 in Review&nbsp;Data Breach Report, 2021;&nbsp;“Data&nbsp;Breaches,”&nbsp;2021;&nbsp;U.S. Data Breaches and Exposed Records 2020, 2021)&nbsp;and 11.5 billion breached passwords have been recorded out in the wild&nbsp;(Haveibeenpwnd?, 2021). And, the problem is only going to get worse as we become more and more connected in the coming years, one estimate predicts that by 2025 people will be interacting with and leaking their identity and data to IoT devices 4,800 times a day, i.e.&nbsp;about every 3.3 seconds&nbsp;(Reinsel et al., 2017), and the ITRC predicts in 2021 we’ll experience the most data breaches ever in a single year; the good news is the number of people impacted will be lower than in previous years (“Data Breaches Are Up 38 Percent in Q2 2021; The ITRC Predicts a New All-Time High by Year’s End,” 2021).</p>
<p>People lack and want control over their physical and digital self (aka data)&nbsp;(DMA &amp; Acxiom, 2015). They want their privacy, they don’t know where to start, they lack the tools and education to manage their data&nbsp;(Babun et al., 2019;&nbsp;“Computer&nbsp;Services&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;The Harris Poll,”&nbsp;2019).</p>
 Identity Protection Services Is Not Enough: The Harms &amp; Costs Caused by a Data Breach 
<p>Identity protection services, like those being offered to the affected, can remind us that we have a problem, that the “Cows” have gotten out of the barn, but they don’t offer a solution. These services will tell someone that a personal attribute, e.g.&nbsp;an email address or social security or government ID number, has been found on the dark web. They rarely tell someone much more, e.g.&nbsp;how their data got leaked in the first place or any other meaningful, actionable insight<a href="http:/#fn2">2</a>. Moreover, they don’t address the emotional, time, economic, physical (inc. life), reputational, relationship, chilling effect, discrimination, thwarted expectations, control, data quality, informed choice, vulnerability, disturbance, autonomy, social, civic, and political harms that people may immediately experience following a breach or that may befall them years after a breach has occurred&nbsp;(Calo, 2010; Citron &amp; Solove, 2021), i.e.&nbsp;long after the identity protection monitoring service bandaid has dried up and fallen off.</p>
<p>The total cost of the potential immediate and long-term harm exposure from a breach far exceeds the $39.99/year value of the identity protection service bandaid. For many, it can take days, weeks, or even years to find out their data was compromised, and it can take many hundreds of hours and upwards of thousands of dollars to recover&nbsp;(“Data&nbsp;Breaches Are Up&nbsp;38&nbsp;Percent&nbsp;in&nbsp;Q22021;&nbsp;The ITRC Predicts&nbsp;a&nbsp;New All-Time High&nbsp;by&nbsp;Year’s&nbsp;End,”&nbsp;2021)&nbsp;from a severe breach or misuse of their data.</p>
<p>And so far we’ve just been talking about “material” past or current harms. What about future harm, i.e. lost opportunity? For example, the lost opportunity to buy a car or house, but you can’t because the breach trashed your credit score and you can’t get the inaccuracies removed. The FTC reported that 20% of people have at least one error in their credit report (Fiano, 2019). Or, the opportunity that can be gained by having control over one’s data (e.g. in the form a personal data store or personal information management system) and using it to learn about one’s self, to more efficiently navigate life, or even profit from one’s own records, attributes, labor, or capital data?</p>
 It’s time to give people a seat at the table 
<p>The elephant in the room, and one not taken nearly seriously enough, is that our personal data has value and this data and value should be in control of the data subject, i.e. the person that it relates to or is generated by. As the former EU commissioner Maglena Kuneva noted as far back as 2009,</p>
<blockquote><p>“Personal data is the new oil of the internet and the new currency of the digital world”&nbsp;“Meglena&nbsp;Kuneva&nbsp;–&nbsp;European Consumer Commissioner&nbsp;–&nbsp;Keynote Speech&nbsp;–&nbsp;Roundtable&nbsp;on&nbsp;Online Data Collection,&nbsp;Targeting&nbsp;and&nbsp;Profiling”&nbsp; Meglena&nbsp;Kuneva&nbsp;–&nbsp;European Consumer Commissioner&nbsp;–&nbsp;Keynote Speech&nbsp;–&nbsp;Roundtable&nbsp;on&nbsp;Online Data Collection,&nbsp;Targeting&nbsp;and&nbsp;Profiling”&nbsp;(2009).</p></blockquote>
<p>Why is it not addressed? Possibly, because the industry says people don’t care about their data? Or, we think regulations will take care of it. More likely, it is because it threatens the efficiency of existing operations and business models and that it is just not practical at scale today and is too hard to implement at this time (Pinarbasi &amp; Pavagadhi, 2020). In aggregate, people’s data is worth trillions of dollars. Corporations are taking the lion’s share of the benefits while individuals are left holding unmitigated risks.&nbsp;<a href="https://identitypraxis.com/the-identity-nexus/">The Identity Nexus</a>&nbsp;equation, the equilibrium state where benefit and risk is equally shared throughout society, is out of balance.</p>
<p>It is time we empower people and give them a share of the riches they are generating, which is worth far more than a free account, recommendation, or article they are getting today. It is time we get The Identity Nexus equation back into balance. Our privacy should not be a luxury good, as it is today. Today people are the entre being served up to industry, primarily in the form of marketing, risk mitigation, and people search&nbsp;(Dixon &amp; Gellman, 2014;&nbsp;“FTC&nbsp;to&nbsp;Study Data Broker Industry’s&nbsp;Collection&nbsp;and&nbsp;Use&nbsp;of&nbsp;Consumer Data,”&nbsp;2012). It is time we move them off the table, and give them a seat at the table. If we enable them to be active participants in the collection, management, and exchange of their data, the personal, civic, social, and commercial bounties will be plentiful. This is not an idea problem, nor a technology problem, it is an imagination and will problem. The ideas have been with us for decades&nbsp;(Bush, 1945; Laudon, 1996;&nbsp;Personal&nbsp;Data, 2011), and the technology is maturing at a breakneck pace. There are pockets of innovation happening today where people are working on putting people in control of their data, like&nbsp;<a href="https://mydata.org/">MyData</a>&nbsp;(see Langford et al. (2020) MyData operators report), the&nbsp;<a href="https://mobileecosystemforum.com/personal-data-identity/">Mobile Ecosystem Forum PD&amp;I working group</a>&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshops</a>, and the many self-sovereign identity working groups at the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/#:~:text=The%20mission%20of%20the%20Decentralized,requirements%20for%20DID%20Method%20specifications.">W3C Ddecentrailized Identity</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Trust over IP Foundation</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org/">The Good Health Pass Collaborative</a>&nbsp;(a group working on a self-sovereign COVID testing credential), to name just a few. The problem is, we’ve simply gotten too comfortable with the status quo and the collective we simply can’t imagine a different world.</p>
 We need systemic change. 
<blockquote><p>“We’re entering an age of personal big data, and its impact on our lives will surpass that of the Internet”&nbsp;(Maney, 2014).</p></blockquote>
<p>Being reminded that there is a problem is not enough to address the problem. We need to prevent harm, or at least mitigate it, before it occurs, as well as address other harms, i.e.&nbsp;the illicit and legal misuses or non-permitted use of our data, and the lost opportunity that people may realize from having cross-sector access and control of their data. In the end, the individual can be the only one that has a complete view of themselves&nbsp;(Brohman et al., 2003). We need to create opportunities for personal fulfillment. Identity protection is a start. But, what people need is control. Contracts, terms of service, and privacy policies are not enough.&nbsp;Regulation is not enough. Trust in commercial and non-commercial institutions to do “the right thing” is not enough. People need to be in a position where they can “trust but verify.”</p>
 Five-pillars of digital sovereignty for the phygital human 
<p>To control their digital self, people need a systematic framework to embrace the five pillars of digital sovereignty–awareness, intention &amp; behavior, insurance, rights, and technology–all of which rests on education. People need education to understand the problem, to know how and when to use the utilities and services, and how and when to take specific actions that suit their personal circumstances, their context. Moreover, regarding rights, they need regulation that recognizes privacy harm, not just privacy law&nbsp;(Gilliland, 2019).</p>
<p>As an industry, we should not just be offering bandaids; we should be providing a suite of convenient, unobtrusive, passive and active, value-generating utilities, services and education (aka privacy-enhancing technologies and personal identity management capabilities) that help people take back control of their data, their digital self. We need to put in the time to build exceptional customer experience, user experience, and contextually relevant content.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Content is King, but Context is God”&nbsp;(Vaynerchuk, 2017)</p></blockquote>
<p>We live in a connected digital age. We have become phygital beings (physical + digital). Today, for many, the digital part of us has more personal, social, and economic value than the physical self. It is time for people to have control of what matters most–their digital self, alongside their physical self. We need to be whole again.</p>

 Bernard (2020)&nbsp;reported that only 1 in 10 Americans took advantage of the settlement offered following the 2017 Equifax data breach that impacted 147 million Americans. 
 The reality is that due to the prevalence of data sharing and exchange and the sheer number of data breaches tracked insect 2005, it is nearly impossible to track the original source of breached data. It is estimated that there have been well over 10,000 data breaches since 2005&nbsp;(2020 in Review&nbsp;Data Breach Report, 2021;&nbsp;“Data&nbsp;Breaches,”&nbsp;2021;&nbsp;U.S. Data Breaches and Exposed Records 2020, 2021). And, according to the ITRC, 2021 is on track to be a record year for data breaches. The number of breaches in Q2 2021 was up 38 percent over Q1 2021. For the year, the H1 2021 breaches account for 76 percent of the 2020 totals. The good news, however, is the total number of people impact in 2021 is going down&nbsp;(“Data&nbsp;Breaches Are Up&nbsp;38&nbsp;Percent&nbsp;in&nbsp;Q2&nbsp;2021;&nbsp;The ITRC Predicts&nbsp;a&nbsp;New All-Time High&nbsp;by&nbsp;Year’s&nbsp;End,”&nbsp;2021)

<p>In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/07/24/pl-pgsql-versus-pl-python-heres-why-im-using-both-to-write-postgres-functions/">episode 2</a> I mentioned three aspects of pl/python that are reasons to use it instead of pl/pgsql: access to Python modules, metaprogramming, and introspection. In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/08/13/pl-python-metaprogramming/">episode 5</a> I discussed metaprogramming, by which I mean using pl/python to compose and run SQL code. This episode features introspection, by which I mean taking advantage of Python’s <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html#module-inspect">inspect</a> module to enable a pl/python function to discover its own name. </p>
<p>Why do that? In this context, so that the function can create a materialized view by joining its own name with the value of its first parameter. Here’s the example from episode 5. </p>
 questions_and_answers_for_group(_group_id text)
  returns setof question_and_answer_for_group as $$
  from plpython_helpers import (
    exists_group_view,
    get_caller_name,
    memoize_view_name
  )
  base_view_name = get_caller_name()
  view_name = f'{base_view_name}_{_group_id}'
  if exists_group_view(plpy, view_name):
    sql = f""" select * from {view_name} """
  else:
    sql = f"""
    -- SQL THAT RETURNS A SETOF QUESTION_AND_ANSWER_FOR_GROUP
    """
    memoize_view_name(sql, view_name)
    sql = f""" select * from {view_name} """
  return plpy.execute(sql)
$$ language plpython3u;
 
<p>The function drives a panel on the course dashboard. An initial call to, say, questions_and_answers_for_group('P1mQaEEp'), creates the materialized view questions_and_answers_for_group_p1mqaeep and returns SELECT * from the view. Subsequent calls skip creating the view and just return SELECT * from it. </p>
<p>Note that the even though the group name is mixed case; the view name created by Postgres is all lowercase. For example:</p>
 create materialized view test_AbC as (select 'ok') with data;
SELECT 1

\d test_AbC
Materialized view "public.test_abc"
 
<p>I want to think of this as a form of capability injection, but it’s really more like a capability wrapper. The capability is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization">memoization</a>. A function endowed with it can run a SQL query and cache the resulting rows in a materialized view before returning them to a SQL SELECT context. The wrapper is boilerplate code that discovers the function’s name, checks for the existence of a corresponding view, and if it isn’t found, calls memoize_view_name(sql, view_name) to run an arbitrary chunk of SQL code whose result set matches the function’s type. So in short: this pattern wraps memoization around a set-returning pl/python function.</p>
<p>As noted in episode 5, although memoize_view_name is called from pl/python, it is not itself a pl/python function. It’s a normal Python function in a module that’s accessible to the instance of Python that the Postgres pl/python extension is using. In my case that module is just a few small functions in file called plpython_helpers.py, installed (cough, copied) to user postgres‘s ~/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/plpython_helpers.py.</p>
<p>So far, there are only two critical functions in that module: get_caller_name() and memoize_view_name.</p>
<p>Here is get_caller_name().</p>
 import re
base_view_name = inspect.stack()[1][3].replace('__plpython_procedure_', '')
return re.sub(r'_\d+$', '', base_view_name)
 
<p>The internal name for a pl/python function created by CREATE FUNCTION foo() looks like __plpython_procedure_foo_981048462. What get_caller_name() returns is just foo.</p>
<p>Here’s memoize_view_name().</p>
 def memoize_view_name(sql, view_name):
  sql = sql.replace('\n', ' ')
  encoded_bytes = base64.b64encode(sql.encode('utf-8'))
  encoded_str = str(encoded_bytes, 'utf-8')
  cmd = f"""psql -d h_analytics -c "call memoizer('{encoded_str}', '{view_name}')" """
  result = os.system(cmd)
  print(f'memoize_view_name: {cmd} result: {result}')
 
<p>Given a chunk of SQL and the name of a view, it converts newlines to spaces, base64-encodes the query text, and invokes psql to call a procedure, memoizer, that does the work of running the SQL query and creating the materialized view from those results. So for example the function that yields <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/08/05/the-tao-of-unicode-sparklines/">sparkline</a> data for a school might look like sparkline_data_for_school('af513ee'), and produce the view sparkline_data_for_school_af513ee.</p>
<p>Why shell out to psql here? It may not be necessary, there may be a way to manage the transaction directly within the function, but if so I haven’t found it. I’m very far from being an expert on transaction semantics and will appreciate guidance here if anyone cares to offer it. Meanwhile, this technique seems to work well. memoizer is a Postgres procedure, not a function. Although “stored procedures” is the term that I’ve always associated with in-database programming, I went pretty far down this path using only CREATE FUNCTION, never CREATE PROCEDURE. When I eventually went there I found the distinction between functions and procedures to be a bit slippery. This <a href="https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/2357/what-are-the-differences-between-stored-procedures-and-stored-functions">StackOverflow answer</a> matches what I’ve observed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PostgreSQL 11 added stored procedures as a new schema object. You can create a new procedure by using the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createprocedure.html"><code>CREATE PROCEDURE</code></a> statement.</p>
<p>Stored procedures differ from functions in the following ways:</p>
 
 
<p>Stored procedures do not have to return anything, and only return a single row when using <code>INOUT</code> parameters.</p>
 
 
<p>You can commit and rollback transactions inside stored procedures, but not in functions.</p>
 
 
<p>You execute a stored procedure using the <code>CALL</code> statement rather than a <code>SELECT</code> statement.</p>
 
 
<p>Unlike functions, procedures cannot be nested in other DDL commands (<code>SELECT</code>, <code>INSERT</code>, <code>UPDATE</code>, <code>DELETE</code>).</p>
 
 
</blockquote>
<p>Here is the memoizer procedure. It happens to be written in pl/python but could as easily have been written in pl/pgsql using the built-in Postgres decode function. Procedures, like functions, can be written in either language (or others) and share the <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/07/27/working-with-postgres-types/">common Postgres type system</a>.</p>
 create procedure memoizer(_sql text, _view_name text) as $$
  import base64
  decoded_bytes = base64.b64decode(_sql)
  decoded_str = str(decoded_bytes, 'utf-8')
  create = f"""
    create materialized view if not exists {_view_name} as (
      {decoded_str}
    ) with data;
    """
  plpy.execute(create)
  permit = f"""
    grant select on {_view_name} to analytics;
  """
  plpy.execute(permit)
$$ language plpython3u;
 
<p>There’s no plpy.commit() here because psql takes care of that automatically. Eventually I wrote other procedures, some of which do their own committing, but that isn’t needed here. </p>
<p>Of course it’s only possible to shell out to psql from a function because pl/python is an “untrusted” language extension. Recall from <a>episode 1</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The ability to wield any of Python’s built-in or loadable modules inside Postgres brings great power. That entails great responsibility, as the Python extension is “untrusted” (that’s the ‘u’ in ‘plpython3u’) and can do anything Python can do on the host system: read and write files, make network requests.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Using Python’s os.system() to invoke psql is another of those superpowers. It’s not something I do lightly, and if there’s a better/safer way I’m all ears.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, this approach is delivering much value. We have two main dashboards, each of which displays a dozen or so panels. The school dashboard reports on annotation activity across all courses at a school. The course dashboard reports on the documents, and selections within documents, that instructors and students are discussing in the course’s annotation layer. Each panel that appears on the school or course dashboard is the output of a memoized function that is parameterized by a school or course id. </p>
<p>The data warehouse runs on a 24-hour cycle. Within that cycle, the first call to a memoized function takes just as long as it takes to run the SQL wrapped by the function. The cached view only comes into play when the function is called again during the same cycle. That can happen in a few different ways.</p>
<p>– A user reloads a dashboard, or a second user loads it.</p>
<p>– A panel expands or refines the results of another panel. For example, questions_and_answers_for_group() provides a foundation for a family of related functions including:</p>
<p>– questions_asked_by_teacher_answered_by_student()</p>
<p>– questions_asked_by_student_answered_by_teacher()</p>
<p>– questions_asked_by_student_answered_by_student()</p>
<p>– A scheduled job invokes a function in order to cache its results before any user asks for them. For example, the time required to cache panels for school dashboards varies a lot. For schools with many active courses it can take minutes to run those queries, so preemptive memoization matters a lot. For schools with fewer active courses it’s OK to memoize on the fly. This method enables flexible cache policy. Across schools we can decide how many of the most-active ones to cache. Within a school, we can decide which courses to cache, e.g. most recent, or most active. The mechanism to display a dashboard panel is always the same function call. The caching done in support of that function is highly configurable.</p>
<p>Caches, of course, must be purged. Since these materialized views depend on core tables it was enough, early on, to do this for views depending on the annotation table.</p>
<p>drop table annotation cascade;</p>
<p>At a certain point, with a growing number of views built during each cycle, the cascade failed.</p>
 ERROR:  out of shared memory
HINT:  You might need to increase max_locks_per_transaction.
 
<p>That wasn’t the answer. Instead we switched to enumerating views and dropping them individually. Again that afforded great flexibility. We can scan the names in the pg_matviews system table and match all the memoized views, or just those for a subset of schools, or just particular panels on school or course dashboards. Policies that govern the purging of cached views can be as flexible as those that govern their creation.</p>

<p>My parents (that’s them, Eleanor and Allen Searls) were married on 17 August 1946, seventy-five years and two days ago. I would have posted something then, but I was busy—though not too busy to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/docsearls/posts/10157908630421573">drop something</a> in Facebook, where much of the readership for this blog, plus the writership of others listed in my <a href="http://weblog.searls.com/">old blogroll</a>, has drifted in the Age of Social Media. Alas, blogging is less social than Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=list+of+all+chat+apps">chatterteriat</a>. But that doesn’t stop me from blogging anyway.</p>
<p>The wedding took place in&nbsp;Minneapolis, for the convenience of Mom’s family of second and third generation Swedish members of the homesteading diaspora, scattered then around Minnesota, North Dakota and Wisconsin. Pop was from New Jersey, and all his immediate kin were there and in New York. After the wedding the couple came east to briefly occupy the home they rented in North Bergen, New Jersey while mostly hanging at Grandma Searls’ house in Fort Lee (where Pop grew up with his two sisters), and then a short drive west of there in Maywood, where Jan and I grew up. I was born less than a year later, and my sister Jan less than two years after that.</p>
<p>In a comment under my Facebook post, Jan writes,</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/albums/72157627459328424">Mom</a> from ND and <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/albums/72157627459297180">Pop</a> from NJ met in <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/424260609/in/album-72157600005052861/">Alaska</a> in the middle of WWII. He’d already served in the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/albums/72157626063363207">Costal Artillery</a> in the early 30s but after D-Day came home to join up. They courted by mail after the war while he was with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Headquarters_Allied_Expeditionary_Force">SHAEFE (he loved that acronym: Supreme HQ Allied Expeditionary Forces Europe)</a>, and Mom <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/424261085/in/album-72157627459328424/">with the Red Cross</a> at a Naval Hospital in Oregon. When he got home, she flew to NJ for 6 days of courtship – at a <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/albums/72157626246795005">small shack</a> at the NJ shore with Pop’s entire family! He came to MN the night before the wedding. They fell in love with the dream of having a family and future together, and always said they really fell in love with each other on their honeymoon and were devoted to each other. Mom was 33, Pop was 38, and they’d already lived lives of adventure, full of friends and family. We grew up knowing were blessed to have them as our parents.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ve added links. The Shack is still there, by the way.</p>
<p>Alas, Mom passed in ’03 and Pop in ’79. But they were exceptionally fine parents and grandparents. Not all kids are so lucky.</p>
<p>So, a belated toast, in pixels.</p>

<p>To be a mobile marketer is to be a marketer.</p>
<p>Mobile is table stakes to marketers, as evidenced by the ubiquitous adoption of mobile devices and services throughout the world in every aspect of our lives. As a marketer, it is important to remember that mobile is not used just for commercial activities; it is used throughout every facet of our lives. We use our mobile devices for everything, from work, play, social, banking, shopping, sex, taxes, death, and religion. No industry, no company, no relationship is immune to mobile. Mobile contributes nearly $4.4 trillion to the world’s GDP&nbsp;(The&nbsp;Mobile Economy&nbsp;2021, 2021). Mobile plays a role in every customer experience and journey; what&nbsp;Julie Ask (2014)&nbsp;considers micro-moments. With mobile, people are connected, and it is important to recognize that the connected individual is the media, is the point-of-sale display. The connected individual is the future of your business. You must learn to be of service to the connected individual and eventually engage them on their terms (more on this later).</p>
 By the Numbers 
<p>The numbers are clear. There are,</p>
 
 5.22 billion unique mobile users (66% of the global population&nbsp;(Kemp et al., 2021), which is estimated to grow to 5.7 billion by 2025&nbsp;(The&nbsp;Mobile Economy&nbsp;2021, 2021). 
 The mobile device is the great unifying digital platform across all racial groups, at least in the U.S.&nbsp;(Atske &amp; Perrin, 2021). 
 8.02 billion mobile connections (yes, many of us have more than one mobile device)&nbsp;(Kemp et al., 2021), which is predicted to grow to 8.8 billion by 2025&nbsp;(The&nbsp;Mobile Economy&nbsp;2021, 2021), and if you take connected devices (devices without a direct mobile network connection) into account the theoretical connections map goes even higher, 24 billion by 2025&nbsp;(The&nbsp;Mobile Economy&nbsp;2021, 2021). 
 Time spent online and in mobile apps is going through the roof; the average person worldwide spends 6h 54m a day on the Internet, 4h 10m a day in mobile apps&nbsp;(Kemp et al., 2021). 
 As of Oct.&nbsp;2020, mobile device market share (aka web traffic) exceeds desktop computers, today mobile accounts for 55.7% of web traffic compared to 41.5% for desktops and 2.73% for tablets&nbsp;(“Desktop Vs&nbsp;Mobile&nbsp;Vs&nbsp;Tablet Market Share Worldwide,”&nbsp;2021). 
 Mobile accounts for 31% of retail e-commerce sales in the U.S.&nbsp;(Coppola, 2021) 
 
<p>We could list stat after stat, but the story will be the same. Mobile, connectivity, is here, and it is not going anywhere.</p>
 Three Favorite Resources 
<p>I was asked were by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.stukent.com/">Stukent</a>,“What are your three top favorite mobile marketing resources?”&nbsp;Sidebar: I’m a co-author of Mobile Marketing Essentials&nbsp;(Hanley et al., 2021).</p>
<p>This is a difficult question to answer, not because I don’t have favorite resources, but because of all of the follow-up questions that come to mind. Resources for what? Understanding the people and their sentiments, needs, wants, and desires? Understanding the connected individual’s behavior? Understanding a specific market sector? Understanding the latest and greatest technologies, where they’ve been, where they are, and where they’re going? Understanding and influencing change on organizational leadership, structure and management? Steps for building out and executing on a multi-channel comms matrix? Methods for measurement and tracking? Estimates for building out a mobile presence—web, apps, messaging? Different engagement tactics at each step along the customer journey? Strategies for mobile enhancing physical media? Understanding the regulatory front and what’s going to happen to all the data to which we’ve become so addicted to, Remember, people are connected, they are concerned, and they want control of their data. Pretty soon, you’ll be accessing data on the connected individual’s terms, not yours. By 2023, per a Gartner prediction, 65% of the world’s population will be protected by modern privacy legislation, that’s up from 10% in 2020&nbsp;(“Gartner&nbsp;Says By&nbsp;2023, 65% of the&nbsp;World’s&nbsp;Population Will Have Its Personal Data Covered Under Modern Privacy Regulations,”&nbsp;2020).</p>
<p>To be an exceptional mobile marketer is to be a polymath. You must be able to look at and evaluate the market and serve your customers through these five lenses—technology, economics, law and regulation, culture, and politics—if you are going to effectively serve people, at scale, and on their terms.</p>
<p>As for what my favorite resources are, rather than pointing specifically to three specific resources, I’d prefer to suggest three resource categories:</p>
 
 The people you serve, the people you serve, are your greatest and most important resource. You must do everything in your power to understand them and fulfill their needs. Keep in mind, as the tools of surveillance capitalism are pulled apart&nbsp;(Zuboff, 2019), it will be even more important for you to find ways to build direct, trusted, bi-directional channels of communications. Your customer database will become your most valued asset. 
 Government and non-governmental organizations, governments, non-governmental organizations, agencies, media properties, and schools (trade groups, sector analysts, consumer advocates, think-tanks/fact tanks, like the PEW Research Center&nbsp;(“Pew&nbsp;Research Center,”&nbsp;2021)&nbsp;or Chiefmartc&nbsp;(“Chief&nbsp;Marketing Technologist&nbsp;–&nbsp;Marketing Technology Management,”&nbsp;2021), and working professors and libraries, etc.) are an invaluable treasure-trove of specific and directional consumer and market insight that you can tap into, often for free. 
 MarTech vendors, vendors provide insights on how to engage the connected (mobile) individual by providing blogs, research, and reports. Yes, they’re there to sell you their services, so you need to be careful and try to read through the hyperbole at times, but if you want to learn about a mobile channel, engage the vendor. Get your hands dirty, subscribe to a free trial of their service. Read their reports. Attend their webinars. Build a relationship with them. 
 
<p>We live in a connected world; consequently, mobile, regardless of the form factor and medium— smartphone, tablet, watch, earbud, voice, email, SMS, OTT message, etc.— is here to stay.</p>

(H0) How do you determine if your new company is addressing the underlying issues that hold back data from being what they imagine it can be?&nbsp;</p><p>The issues that hold back an organisation from really capturing the value of data are at a&nbsp; minimum: org structures, people issues, a lack of accountability, and incentives. Whilst having a CDO, doing data science, having analytics, using artificial intelligence, testing data quality, and a world class data governance structure make a difference; true transformation will remain a struggle if the structural issues remain.</p><p>The question is how do we, as a CDO, test the fitness of our organisation's preparedness for data.&nbsp; If the results are acceptable to the leadership team is one of politics and is way beyond&nbsp; the scope of this article.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>To test the fitness of your organisation's preparedness for data, it is worth looking at four areas. Is there a preparedness plan? How they put data to work today. Organizational Capability, and finally Culture.</p><p>Is there a preparedness plan?</p><p>This is really simple, ask the CEO if there is a preparedness plan. If there is, ask for a copy of it and review it with the framing of data. If there is not one, probably best to ask why not.&nbsp; There may be one, but check the data of publication (issue), and if it does not address all the areas of responsibility that come under the CDO,&nbsp; you need to flag that it needs work.</p><p>How they put data to work today.</p><p>Does the company equally value “<a href="https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/2021/04/what-superpowers-does-cdo-need.html">small data</a>” as well as big data and data science? Does it hold small data with the same level of importance and priority as big data. Small data is also termed <a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo/what-superpowers-does-a-cdo-need-7f7361a1f20">thick data</a>.&nbsp; It is small in size but has depth of insights.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The media attention on data science makes it appear far easier than it is. You need to determine if this organisation is based on data science from social media posts or on data science from the commitment of time and resources.&nbsp; It is worth investigating if there is built-in structural animosity between the data science teams which are invested in driving change, and the rest of the business , which is driven by KPI and incentives.&nbsp; Where do the teams sit and how are they bridged?</p><p>Lastly review past management and board papers and recommendations to determine if there is <a href="https://opengovernance.net/updating-board-paper-for-a-data-attestation-section-db59d736ccc5">attestation of data</a> or if the blind are leading the blind.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Organizational Capability</p><p>A company’s organisation is supposed, amongst other things, to make it possible for people to do their work, with control in place to ensure they are doing the right work. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/organizational-capabilities-dr-hisham-salah/">Organisational capability</a> can be a major hurdle when it comes to making data work, as divisions are often organised to optimise for different objectives.&nbsp;</p><p>There are numerous issues including management’s confusion and conflation of data, technology, data silos, and the lack of clear responsibility around data roles. When there is a lack of skilled data architects, data engineers, and data quality professionals the organisation just does not have the capability or structure.&nbsp;</p><p>All regular readers of this column know that I often verbally fight against leaders who opine that <a href="https://opengovernance.net/data-is-data-90ba0b803178">data is the new oil</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo/why-framing-data-as-an-asset-or-liability-is-dangerous-fbce0342e66d">preach that data is an asset</a>, and demand <a href="https://www.digital20.com/masterclass">data-driven decisions</a> - as they don’t have a clue. The reality for most employees is that “data” to them is just another thing they need in order to do their jobs. Companies don’t sort out ways to create value from data as they don’t teach people how to use it to make better decisions. (<a href="https://www.digital20.com/masterclass">my masterclass does)&nbsp;</a></p><p>Organisation changes needed to address the structural issues are the responsibility of a company’s senior leadership. Yet most leaders appear to be sitting on the sidelines, perhaps fearful themselves or unsure of what to do and waiting for McKinsey, Deloitte, Accenture, PWC, BCG or one of the other global consulting firms to give them an answer.&nbsp; This is want you are seeking to determine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Culture</p><p>The implications for all those interested in advancing data for better decisions are profound. Culture is often cited as the biggest barrier to progress with data, I will argue and my analysis confirms it, that it is in fact <a href="https://opengovernance.net/data-for-better-decisions-nature-or-nurture-79e6531dbe3a">ontology</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo/cdo-day-0-the-many-faces-of-evidence-56ca92430e36">epistemology</a> that holds companies back.&nbsp; The questions to ask the organisation is, “Is there a top level ontology?” and “How do we know what we know is true”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p>Note to the CEO</p><p>“Testing the fitness of your organisation's preparedness for data”is one of the most important jobs you will delegate.&nbsp; When interviewing for your next CDO, ask them the question “how would they test this organisation for preparedness?” &nbsp; There is no point in asking about their data expertise and capability, they would not be sat in front of you if they were not top of their game. &nbsp; How will they address the politics and policies based on their review.&nbsp; The point here is that if you like their smooth approach, they are likely the wrong person as you will just get more compromises and not the action focussed delivery required to become that data company you desire.&nbsp;</p><br><br><p>Whilst our ongoing agile iteration into <a href="https://opengovernance.net/what-occurs-when-physical-beings-transition-to-information-beings-146ea9dcbca3">information beings</a> is never-ending, there are the first 100 days in the new role. But what to focus on? Well, that rose-tinted period of conflicting priorities is what <a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo/">&lt;/Hello, CDO!&gt;</a> is all about. Maintaining sanity when all else has been lost to untested data assumptions is a different problem entirely.</p> <br>

  <p>Summary:      Most of the activities IT performs aren't strategic. Like clean sheets, they're important, but not differentiating. How do you determine what's strategic? Evaluate the domains of your business.</p>



<p>
    Suppose you're in the hotel business. One of the things you have to do is make sure customers have clean sheets. If you don't change the sheets or launder them properly, you're probably not going to stay in business long. The bad news is that clean sheets are expensive and they don't differentiate you very much—all your competitors have clean sheets. You're stuck. 
</p>

<p>
    Consider the following graph plotting the cost of any given business decision against the competitive advantage it brings:
</p>


	<a></a>
	Feature Cost vs Differentiation (click to enlarge)


<p>
    To the right in this diagram are the things we'd call strategic, representing features or practices that differentiate the organization from its competitors. The bottom half of the diagram contains the things that are relatively less expensive. Clearly if you're making a decision on what features to implement, you want to be in the lower right quadrant: low cost and high differentiation. Do those first. 
</p>

<p>
    The red quadrant seems like the last place you'd look for features, or is it? Think about clean sheets. As I noted earlier, clean sheets cost a lot of money and everyone has them, so there's not much competitive advantage in having them. But there's a huge competitive disadvantage if you don't. No one can do without clean sheets. Businesses are filled with things like clean sheets. For IT, things like availability, security, networks, and deployment are all clean sheets.  Doing these well can differentiate you from those who don't, but they're not strategic. You still need a strategy.
</p>

<p>
    How can you discover the things that really matter? I'm a fan of domain driven design. Domain driven design is a tool for looking at the various domains your business is engaged in and then determining which are core (differentiating), supporting, or merely generic. The things you identify as core are strategic—places you can differentiate yourself. This helps because now you know where to build and where to buy. Generic domains aren't unimportant (think HR or finance, for example), they're simply not strategic. And therefore buying those features is likely going to give you high availability and feature fit for far less money than doing it yourself. 
</p>

<p>
    On the other hand, domains that are core are the places you differentiate yourself. When you look at your organization's values, mission, and objectives, the core domains ought to directly support them. If you outsource these, then anyone else can do what you're doing. Core, strategic activities are places where it makes sense to build rather than buy. Spend your time and resources there. But don't neglect the sheets.

Intriguing approach.<br><br>They also practice trunk driven development with feature flags: "Always start a feature with a feature flag and try to get something to production on day 1."<br><br>And "If a product decision is missing, try to make this decision yourself - it's better to ask for forgiveness rather than permission."</p>

<p>The NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders and the NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders.TagHelpers Nuget packages are added to the csproj file of the web application. The tag helpers are added to use the nonce from the CSP in the Razor Pages.</p>

		Version="0.16.0" /&gt;
	&lt;PackageReference 
		Include="NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders.TagHelpers" 
		Version="0.16.0" /&gt;
&lt;/ItemGroup&gt;
  


<p>What each header protects against is explained really good on the <a href="https://securityheaders.com/">securityheaders.com</a> results view of your test. You can click different links of each validation which takes you to the documentation of each header. The links at the bottom of this post provide some excellent information about what and why of the headers.</p>



<p>The security header definitions are added using the HeaderPolicyCollection class. I added this to a separate class to keep the Startup class small, where the middleware is added. I passed a boolean parameter into the method which is used to add or remove the HSTS header. We might not want to add this to local development and block all non HTTPS requests to localhost. </p>



<p>The policy defined in this demo is for Razor Page applications with as much blocked as possible. You should be able to re-use this in your projects.</p>



<p>The COOP (Cross Origin Opener Policy), COEP (Cross Origin Embedder Policy), CORP (Cross Origin Resource Policy) headers are relatively new. You might need to update you existing application deployments with these. The links at the bottom of the post provide information about these headers in detail and I would recommend reading these.</p>

<p>In the Startup class, the UseSecurityHeaders method is used to apply the HTTP headers policy and add the middleware to the application. The env.IsDevelopment() is used to add or not to add the HSTS header. The default HSTS middleware from the ASP.NET Core templates was removed from the Configure method as this is not required. </p>


  public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
	if (env.IsDevelopment())
	{
		app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
	}
	else
	{
		app.UseExceptionHandler("/Error");
	}

		SecurityHeadersDefinitions
			.GetHeaderPolicyCollection(env.IsDevelopment()));
  


<p>The server header can be removed in the program class if using Kestrel. If using IIS, you probably need to use the web.config to remove this.</p>


  public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =&gt;
	Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
		.ConfigureWebHostDefaults(webBuilder =&gt;

<p>We want to apply the CSP nonce to all our scripts in the Razor Pages. We can add the NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders namespace to the _ViewImports.cshtml file.</p>


  @using AspNetCoreRazor
@using NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders
@namespace AspNetCoreRazor.Pages
@addTagHelper *, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers

  


<p>In the Razor Page _Layout, the CSP nonce can be used. I had to get the nonce from the HttpContext and add this to all scripts. This way, the scripts will be loaded. If the nonce does not match or is not applied to the script, it will not be loaded due to the CSP definition. I’ll ping Andrew Lock to see if the tag helper could be used directly.</p>


      @{var nonce = Context.GetNonce();}
    &lt;script src="~/lib/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js" nonce="@nonce"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src="~/lib/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" nonce="@nonce"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src="~/js/site.js" asp-append-version="true" nonce="@nonce"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

    @await RenderSectionAsync("Scripts", required: false)
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

  


<p>The Http security headers can be tested using <a href="https://securityheaders.com">https://securityheaders.com </a></p>



<p>I used ngrok to test this before I deployed the application. The Security headers scans the web application and returns a really neat summary to what headers you have and how good it finds them. Each header has a link to a excellent documentation, blog on <a href="https://twitter.com/Scott_Helme">Scott Helme</a>‘s website <a href="https://scotthelme.co.uk">https://scotthelme.co.uk</a></p>







<p>The CSP can be tested using the <a href="https://csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com">https://csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com</a> from google. The CSP evaluator gives an excellent summary and also suggestions how to improve the CSP.</p>







<p>The Razor Page application security can be much improved by added the headers to the application. The  <a href="https://github.com/andrewlock/NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders">NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders</a> Nuget package makes it incredibly easy to apply this. I will create a follow up blog with a policy definition for a Blazor application and also a for an Web API application. </p>



<p>Notes:</p>



<p>If the application is fully protected without any public views, the follow redirects checkbox on the security headers needs to be disabled as then you only get the results of the identity provider used to authenticate. </p>



<p>I block all traffic, if possible, which is not from my domain including sub domains. If implementing enterprise applications, I would always do this. If implementing public facing applications with high traffic volumes or need extra fast response times, or need to reduce the costs of hosting, then CDNs would need to be used, allowed and so on. Try to block all first and open up as required and maybe you can avoid some nasty surprises from all the Javascript, CSS frameworks used.</p>

<p>The Web is a haystack.</p>
<p>This isn’t what <a href="https://customercommons.org/a-new-way/">Tim Berners-Lee</a> had in mind when he invented the Web. Nor is it what Jerry Yang and David Filo had in mind when they invented&nbsp;<a href="https://money.cnn.com/gallery/technology/2015/03/03/yahoo-20-years-hits-flops/10.html">Jerry and David’s Guide to the World Wide Web</a>, which later became&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!">Yahoo</a>. Jerry and David’s model for the Web was a library, and Yahoo was to be catalog for it. This made sense, given the prevailing conceptual frames for the Web at the time:&nbsp;real estate and publishing. Both are still with us today. We frame the Web as real estate when we speak of “sites” with “locations” in “domains” with “addresses” you can “visit” and “browse” through stuff called “files” and “pages,” which we “author,” “edit,” “post,” “publish,” “syndicate” and store in “folders” within a “directory.” Both frames suggest durability, if not permanence. Again, kind of like a library.</p>
<p>But once we added personal movement (“surf,” “browse”) and a vehicle for it (the browser), the Web became a World Wide Free-for-all. Literally. Anyone could publish, change and remove whatever they pleased, whenever they pleased. The same went for organizations of every kind, all over the world. And everyone with a browser could find their way to and through all of those spaces and places, and enjoy whatever “content” publishers chose to put there. Thus the Web grew into billions of sites, pages, images, databases, videos, and other stuff, with most of it changing constantly.</p>
<p>The result was a heaving heap of fuck-all.*</p>
<p>How big is it? According to <a href="https://www.worldwidewebsize.com/">WorldWebSize.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://google.com">Google</a>&nbsp;currently indexes about 41 billion pages, and&nbsp;<a href="https://bing.com">Bing</a>&nbsp;about 9 billion. They also peaked together at about 68 billion pages in late 2019. The Web is surely larger than that, but that’s the practical limit because search engines are the practical way to find pieces of straw in that thing. Will the haystack be less of one when approached by other search engines, such as the new <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/29/opinion/sway-kara-swisher-sridhar-ramaswamy.html?showTranscript=1">ad-less</a> (subscription-funded)&nbsp;<a href="https://neeva.com/">Neeva</a>? Nope. Search engines do not give the Web a card catalog. They certify its nature as a haystack.</p>
<p>So that’s one practical limit. There are others, but they’re hard to see when the level of optionality on the Web is almost indescribably vast. But we can see a few limits by asking some questions:</p>
 
 Why do you always have to accept websites’ terms? And why do you have no record of your own of what you accepted, or when‚ or anything? 
 Why do you have no way to proffer your own terms, to which websites can agree? 
 Why did <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track">Do Not Track</a>, which was never more than a polite request not to be tracked off a website, get no respect from 99.x% of the world’s websites? And how the hell did Do Not Track turn into the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2011/tracking-protection/drafts/tracking-dnt.html">Tracking Preference Expression</a> at the W2C, where the standard never did get fully baked? 
 Why, after Do Not Track failed, did hundreds of millions—or <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2019/03/23/2billion/">perhaps billions</a>—of people start blocking ads, tracking or both, on the Web, amounting to <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2015/09/28/beyond-ad-blocking-the-biggest-boycott-in-human-history/">the biggest boycott in world history</a>? And then why did the advertising world, including nearly all advertisers, their agents, and their dependents in publishing, treat this as a problem rather than a clear and gigantic message from the marketplace? 
 Why are the choices presented to you by websites called&nbsp;your choices, when all those choices are provided by&nbsp;them? And why don’t you give them choices? 
 Why would <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2021/05/29/apple-vs-or-plus-adtech/">Apple’s way of making you private on your phone</a> be to “Ask App Not to Track,” rather than “Tell App Not to Track,” or “Prevent App From Tracking You”? 
 Why does the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">GDPR</a> call people “data subjects” rather than people, or human beings, and then assign the roles “data controller” and “data processor” only to other parties?* 
 Why are nearly all the 200+million results in <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gdpr+compliance">a search for GDPR+compliance</a> about how companies can obey the letter of the law while violating its spirit by continuing to track people through the giant loophole you see in every cookie notice? 
 Why does the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Consumer_Privacy_Act">CCPA</a> give you the right to ask to have back personal data others have gathered about you on the Web, rather than forbid its collection in the first place? (Imagine a law that assumes that all farmers’ horses are gone from their barns, but gives those farmers a right to demand horses back from those who took them. It’s kinda like that.) 
 Why, 22 years after <a href="http://cluetrain.com">The Cluetrain Manifesto</a> said, we are not seats or eyeballs or end users or consumers. we are human beings and our reach exceeds your grasp. deal with it. —is that statement still not true? 
 Why, 9 years after Harvard Business Review Press published&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Intention-Economy-When-Customers-Charge/dp/1422158527">The Intention Economy: When Customers Take Charge</a>, has that not happened? (Really, what are you in charge of in the marketplace that isn’t inside companies’ silos and platforms?) 
 
<p>It’s easy to blame&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie">the cookie</a>, which&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lou_Montulli">Lou Montulli</a> invented in 1994 as a way for sites to remember their visitors by planting reminder files—cookies—in visitors’ browsers. Cookies also gave visitors a way to remember where they were when they last visited. For sites that require logins, cookies take care of that as well.</p>
<p>What matters, however, is not the cookie. It’s what makes the cookie necessary in the first place: the Web’s architecture. It’s called&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model">client-server</a>, and is represented graphically like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model"></a></p>
<p>This architecture was born in the era of centralized mainframes, which “users” accessed through client devices called “dumb terminals”:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-dcom/9781449307011/ch01s01.html"></a></p>
<p>On the Web, as it was in the old mainframe world, we clients—mere users—are as subordinate to servers as are cattle to ranchers or slaves to masters. In the client-server paradigm, our agency—our ability to act with effect in the world—is restricted to what servers allow or provide for us. Our choices are what they provide. We are independent only to the degree that we can also be clients to other servers. In this paradigm, a free market is “your choice of captor.”</p>
<p>Want privacy? You have to ask for it. And, if you go to the trouble of doing that—which you have to do separately with every site and service you encounter (each a mainframe of its own)—your client doesn’t keep a record of what you “agreed” to. The server does. Good luck finding whatever it is the server or its third parties remember about that agreement.</p>
<p>Want to control how your data (or data about you) gets processed by the servers of the world? Good luck with that too. Again, Europe’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">GDPR</a> says “natural persons” are just “data subjects,” while “data controllers” and “data processors” are roles reserved for servers.</p>
<p>Want a shopping cart of your own to take from site to site? My wife asked for that in 1995. It’s still barely thinkable in 2021. Want a dashboard for your life where you can gather all your expenses, investments, property records, health information, calendars, contacts, and other personal information? She asked for that too, and we still don’t have it, except to the degree that large server operators (e.g. Google, Apple, Microsoft) give us pieces of it, hosted in their clouds, and rigged to keep you captive to their systems.</p>
<p>That’s why we don’t yet have an Internet of Things (IoT), but rather an Apple of Things, a Google of Things, and an Amazon of Things.</p>
<p>Is it possible to do stuff on the Web that isn’t client-server? Perhaps some techies among us can provide examples, but practically speaking, here’s what matters:&nbsp;If it’s not thinkable by the owners of the servers we depend on, it doesn’t get made.</p>
<p>From our position at the bottom of the Web’s haystack, it’s hard to imagine there might be a world where it’s possible for us to have full agency: to not be just users of clients enslaved to as many servers as we deal with every day.</p>
<p>But that world exists. It’s called the Internet, and it can support a helluva lot more than the Web, with many ways to interact other than those possible in the client-server world alone.</p>
<p>Digital technology as we know it has only been around for a few decades, and the Internet for maybe half that time. Mobile computers that run apps and presume connectivity everywhere have only been with us for a decade or less. And all of those will be with us for many decades, centuries, or millennia to come. We are not going to stop living digital lives, any more than we are going to stop speaking, writing, or using mathematics. Digital technology and the Internet are granted wishes that won’t go back into the genie’s bottle.</p>
<p>So yes, the Web is wonderful, but not boundlessly so. It has limits. Thanks to the client-server architecture that prevails there, full personal agency is not a grace of life on the Web. For the thirty-plus years of the Web’s existence, and for its foreseeable future, we will&nbsp;never have more agency than its servers allow clients and users.</p>
<p>It’s time to think and build outside the haystack. Models for that do exist, and some have been around a long time.</p>
<p>Email, for example. While you can look at your email on the Web, or use a Web-based email service (such as Gmail), email itself is independent of those. My own&nbsp;<a href="http://searls.com" title="http://searls. ">searls.com</a> email has been at servers in my home, on racks elsewhere, and in a hired cloud. I can move it anywhere I want. You can move yours as well. All the services I hire to host my email are substitutable. That’s just one way we can enjoy full agency on the Internet.</p>
<p>My own work outside the Web is currently happening at <a href="http://customercommons.org">Customer Commons</a>, on what we call the <a href="https://customercommons.org/a-new-way/">Byway</a>. Go there and follow along as we work to toward better answers to the questions above than you’ll get from inside the haystack.</p>
 
<p>*I originally had “heaving haystack of fuck-all” here, but some remember it as the more alliterative “heaving heap of fuck-all.” So I decided to swap them. If comments actually worked here, I’d ask for a vote. But feel free to write me instead, at first name at last name dot com.</p>

<p>One of the compelling aspects of <a href="https://modern-sql.com/">modern SQL</a> is the JSON support built into modern engines, including Postgres. The <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/functions-json.html">documentation</a> is well done, but I need examples to motivate my understanding of where and how and why to use such a capability. The one I’ll use in this episode is something I call document hotspots.</p>
<p>Suppose a teacher has asked her students to annotate Arthur Miller’s The Crucible. How can she find the most heavily-annotated passages? They’re visible in the Hypothesis client, of course, but may be sparsely distributed. She can scroll through the 154-page PDF document to find the hotspots, but it will be helpful to see a report that brings them together. Let’s do that.</p>
<p>The Hypothesis system stores annotations using a blend of SQL and JSON datatypes. Consider this sample annotation:</p>
<p></p>
<p>When the Hypothesis client creates that annotation it sends a JSON payload to the server. Likewise, when the client subsequently requests the annotation in order to anchor it to the document, it receives a similar JSON payload.</p>

<p>The server mostly shreds this JSON into conventional SQL types. The tags array, for example, is hoisted out of the JSON into a SQL array-of-text. The expression to find its length is a conventional Postgres idiom: array_length(tags,1). Note the second parameter; array_length(tags) is an error, because Postgres arrays can be multidimensional. In this case there’s only one dimension but it’s still necessary to specify that.</p>
<p>A target_selectors column, though, is retained as JSON. These selectors define how an annotation anchors to a target selection in a document. Because selectors are used only by the Hypothesis client, which creates and consumes them in JSON format, there’s no reason to shred them into separate columns. In normal operation, selectors don’t need to be related to core tables. They can live in the database as opaque blobs of JSON.</p>
<p>For some analytic queries, though, it is necessary to peer into those blobs and relate their contents to core tables. There’s a parallel set of functions for working with JSON. For example, the target_selectors column corresponds to the target[0]['selector'] array in the JSON representation. The expression to find the length of that array is jsonb_array_length(target_selectors).</p>
<p>Here’s a similar expression that won’t work: json_array_length(target_selectors). Postgres complains that the function doesn’t exist.</p>
 ERROR: function json_array_length(jsonb) does not exist 
Hint: No function matches the given name and argument types.
 
<p>In fact both functions, json_array_length and jsonb_array_length, exist. But Postgres knows the target_selectors column is of type jsonb, not json which is the correct type for the json_array_length function. What’s the difference between json and jsonb?</p>
<blockquote><p>The json and jsonb data types accept almost identical sets of values as input. The major practical difference is one of efficiency. The json data type stores an exact copy of the input text, which processing functions must reparse on each execution; while jsonb data is stored in a decomposed binary format that makes it slightly slower to input due to added conversion overhead, but significantly faster to process, since no reparsing is needed. jsonb also supports indexing, which can be a significant advantage.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/datatype-json.html">https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/datatype-json.html</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Although I tend to use JSON to refer to data in a variety of contexts, the flavor of JSON in the Postgres queries, views, and functions I’ll discuss will always be jsonb. The input conversion overhead isn’t a problem for analytics work that happens in a data warehouse, and the indexing support is a tremendous enabler.</p>
<p>To illustrate some of the operators common to json and jsonb, here is a query that captures the target_selectors column from the sample annotation.</p>
 with example as (
  select 
    id,
    target_selectors as selectors
  from annotation
  where id = '54b52170-fd7e-11eb-879f-931b9c6809d3'
  )
  select * from example;
 
<p></p>
<p>Here are some other queries against example</p>
 select selectors from example;

[{"end": 44483, "type": "TextPositionSelector", "start": 44392}, { ... } ]
 
<p>The result is a human-readable representation, but the type of selectors is jsonb.</p>
 select pg_typeof(selectors) from example;

jsonb
 
<p>The array-indexing operator, -&gt;, can yield the zeroth element of the array.</p>
 select selectors-&gt;0 from example;

{"end": 44483, "type": "TextPositionSelector", "start": 44392}
 
<p>The result is again a human-readable representation of a jsonb type.</p>
 select pg_typeof(selectors-&gt;0) from example;

jsonb
 
<p>Another array-indexing operator, -&gt;&gt;, can also yield the zeroth element of the array, but now as type text.</p>
 select selectors-&gt;&gt;0 from example;

{"end": 44483, "type": "TextPositionSelector", "start": 44392}
 
<p>The result looks the same, but the type is different.</p>
 select pg_typeof(selectors-&gt;&gt;0) from example;

text
 
<p>The -&gt; and -&gt;&gt; operators can also index objects by their keys. These examples work with the object that is the zeroth element of the array.</p>
 select selectors-&gt;0-&gt;'type' from example;

"TextPositionSelector"

select pg_typeof(selectors-&gt;0-&gt;'type') from example;

jsonb

select selectors-&gt;0-&gt;&gt;'type' from example;

TextPositionSelector

select pg_typeof(selectors-&gt;0-&gt;&gt;'type') from example;

text
 
<p>The Hypothesis system stores the location of a target (i.e, the selection in a document to which an annotation refers) in the target_selectors column we’ve been exploring. It records <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/#selectors">selectors</a>. TextQuoteSelector represents the selection as the exact highlighted text bracketed by snippets of context. TextPositionSelector represents it as a pair of numbers that mark the beginning and end of the selection. When one range formed by that numeric pair is equal to another, it means two students have annotated the same selection. When a range contains another range, it means one student annotated the containing range, and another student made an overlapping annotation on the contained range. We can use these facts to surface hotspots where annotations overlap exactly or in nested fashion.</p>
<p>To start, let’s have a function to extract the start/end range from an annotation. In a conventional programming language you might iterate through the selectors in the target_selectors array looking for the one with the type TextPositionSelector. That’s possible in pl/pgsql and pl/python, but Postgres affords a more SQL-oriented approach. Given a JSON array, the function jsonb_array_elements returns a table-like object with rows corresponding to array elements.</p>
 select jsonb_array_elements(selectors) from example;

{"end": 44483, "type": "TextPositionSelector", "start": 44392}
{"type": "TextQuoteSelector", "exact": " am not some preaching farmer with a book under my arm; I am a graduate of Harvard College.", "prefix": " sixty-six pound, Mr. Proctor! I", "suffix": " Giles: Aye, and well instructed"}
 
<p>A function can convert the array to rows, select the row of interest, select the start and end values from the row, package the pair of numbers as an array, and return the array.</p>
 create function position_from_anno(_id uuid) returns numeric[] as $$
  declare range numeric[];
  begin
    with selectors as (
      select jsonb_array_elements(target_selectors) as selector
      from annotation
      where id = _id
    ),
    position as (
      select
        selector-&gt;&gt;'start'::numeric as startpos,
        selector-&gt;&gt;'end'::numeric as endpos
      from selectors
      where selector-&gt;&gt;'type' = 'TextPositionSelector'
    )
    select array[p.startpos, p.endpos] 
    from position p
    into range;
    return range;
  end;  
$$ language plpgsql;
 
<p>Using it for the sample annotation:</p>
 select position_from_anno('54b52170-fd7e-11eb-879f-931b9c6809d3')

position_from_anno
------------------
{44392,44483}
 
<p>I’ll show how to use position_from_anno to find document hotspots in a later episode. The goal here is just to introduce an example, and to illustrate a few of the JSON functions and operators.</p>
<p>What’s most interesting, I think, is this part.</p>
<p>where selector-&gt;&gt;'type' = 'TextPositionSelector'</p>
<p>Although the TextPositionSelector appears as the first element of the selectors array, that isn’t guaranteed. In a conventional language you’d have to walk through the array looking for it. SQL affords a declarative way to find an element in a JSON array.</p>

  <p>This week I <a href="https://datasette.substack.com/p/everything-new-in-datasette-since">broke my streak</a> of not sending out the Datasette newsletter, figured out how to use Sphinx for Python class documentation, worked out how to run Datasette on GitHub Codespaces, implemented Datasette column metadata and got tantalizingly close to a solution for an elusive Datasette feature.</p>
 API reference documentation for sqlite-utils using Sphinx 
<p>I've never been a big fan of Javadoc-style API documentation: I usually find that documentation structured around classes and methods fails to show me how to actually use those classes to solve real-world problems. I've tended to avoid it for my own projects.</p>
<p>My <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/">sqlite-utils Python library</a> has a ton of functionality, but it mainly boils down to two classes: <code>Database</code> and <code>Table</code>. Since it  already has pretty comprehesive narrative documentation explaining the different problems it can solve, I decided to try experimenting with the <a href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html">Sphinx autodoc</a> module to produce some classic <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/reference.html">API reference documentation</a> for it:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Since autodoc works from docstrings, this was also a great excuse to add more comprehensive docstrings and type hints to the library. This helps tools like Jupyter notebooks and VS Code display more useful inline help.</p>
<p>This proved to be time well spent! Here's what <code>sqlite-utils</code> looks like in VS Code now:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Running <code>mypy</code> against the type hints also helped me identify and fix a couple of obscure edge-case bugs in the existing methods, detailed in <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v3-15-1">the 3.15.1 release notes</a>. It's taken me a few years but I'm finally starting to come round to Python's optional typing as being worth the additional effort!</p>
<p>Figuring out how to use autodoc in Sphinx, and then how to get the documentation to build correctly on <a href="https://readthedocs.org/">Read The Docs</a> took some effort. I wrote up what I learned in <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/sphinx/sphinx-autodoc">this TIL</a>.</p>
 Datasette on GitHub Codespaces 
<p>GitHub released their new <a href="https://github.com/features/codespaces">Codespaces</a> online development environments to general availability this week and I'm really excited about it. I ran a team at Eventbrite for a while resonsible for development environment tooling and it really was shocking how much time and money was lost to broken local development environments, even with a significant amount of engineering effort applied to the problem.</p>
<p>Codespaces promises a fresh, working development environment on-demand any time you need it. That's a very exciting premise! Their detailed write-up of how they convinced GitHub's own internal engineers to move to it is full of <a href="https://github.blog/2021-08-11-githubs-engineering-team-moved-codespaces/">intriguing details</a> - getting an existing application working with it is no small feat, but the pay-off looks very promising indeed.</p>
<p>So... I decided to try and get Datasette running on it. It works really well!</p>
<p>You can run Datasette in any Codespace environment using the following steps:</p>
 
 Open the terminal. Three-bar-menu-icon, View, Terminal does the trick. 
 In the terminal run <code>pip install datasette datasette-x-forwarded-host</code> (more on this in a moment). 
 Run <code>datasette</code> - Codespaces will automatically setup port forwarding and give you a link to "Open in Browser" - click the link and you're done! 
 
<p>You can <code>pip install sqlite-utils</code> and then use <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/cli.html#inserting-csv-or-tsv-data">sqlite-utils insert</a> to create SQLite databases to use with Datasette.</p>
<p>There was one catch: the first time I ran Datasette, clicking on any of the internal links within the web application took me to <code>http://localhost/</code> pages that broke with a 404.</p>
<p>It turns out the Codespaces proxy sends a <code>host: localhost</code> header - which Datasette then uses to incorrectly construct internal URLs.</p>
<p>So I wrote a tiny ASGI plugin, <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-x-forwarded-host">datasette-x-forwarded-host</a>, which takes the incoming <code>X-Forwarded-Host</code> provided by Codespaces and uses that as the <code>Host</code> header within Datasette itself. After that everything worked fine.</p>
 sqlite-utils insert --flatten 
<p>Early this week I finally figured out <a href="https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/logging">Cloud Run logging</a>. It's actually really good! In doing so, I worked out <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/cloudrun/tailing-cloud-run-request-logs">a convoluted recipe</a> for tailing the JSON logs locally and piping them into a SQLite database so that I could analyze them with Datasette.</p>
<p>Part of the reason it was convoluted is that Cloud Run logs feature nested JSON, but <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/cli.html#inserting-json-data">sqlite-utils insert</a> only works against an array of flat JSON objects. I had to use <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/jq/flatten-nested-json-objects-jq">this jq monstrosity</a> to flatten the nested JSON into key/value pairs.</p>
<p>Since I've had to solve this problem a few times now I decided to improve <code>sqlite-utils</code> to have it do the work instead. You can now use the new <code>--flatten</code> option like so:</p>
 <code>sqlite-utils insert logs.db logs log.json --flatten
</code> 
<p>To create a schema that flattens nested objects into a <code>topkey_nextkey</code> structure like so:</p>
  CREATE TABLE [logs] (
   [httpRequest_latency] TEXT,
   [httpRequest_requestMethod] TEXT,
   [httpRequest_requestSize] TEXT,
   [httpRequest_status] INTEGER,
   [insertId] TEXT,
   [labels_service] TEXT
);  
<p>Full <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/cli.html#flattening-nested-json-objects">documentation for --flatten</a>.</p>
 Datasette column metadata 
<p>I've been wanting to add this for a while: Datasette's main branch now includes an implementation of <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/metadata.html#column-descriptions">column descriptions metadata</a> for Datasette tables. This is best illustrated by a screenshot (of <a href="https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures/roadside_attractions">this live demo</a>):</p>
<p></p>
<p>You can add the following to <code>metadata.yml</code> (or <code>.json</code>) to specify descriptions for the columns of a given table:</p>
  databases:
  fixtures:
    roadside_attractions:
      columns:
        name: The name of the attraction
        address: The street address for the attraction  
<p>Column descriptions will be shown in a <code>&lt;dl&gt;</code> at the top of the page, and will also be added to the menu that appears when you click on the cog icon at the top of a column.</p>
 Getting closer to query column metadata, too 
<p>Datasette lets you execute arbitrary SQL queries, like this one:</p>
  select
  roadside_attractions.name,
  roadside_attractions.address,
  attraction_characteristic.name
from
  roadside_attraction_characteristics
  join roadside_attractions on roadside_attractions.pk = roadside_attraction_characteristics.attraction_id
  join attraction_characteristic on attraction_characteristic.pk = roadside_attraction_characteristics.characteristic_id  
<p>You can <a href="https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures?sql=select%0D%0A++roadside_attractions.name%2C%0D%0A++roadside_attractions.address%2C%0D%0A++attraction_characteristic.name%0D%0Afrom%0D%0A++roadside_attraction_characteristics%0D%0A++join+roadside_attractions+on+roadside_attractions.pk+%3D+roadside_attraction_characteristics.attraction_id%0D%0A++join+attraction_characteristic+on+attraction_characteristic.pk+%3D+roadside_attraction_characteristics.characteristic_id">try that here</a>. It returns the following:</p>



name
address

<p>The columns it returns have names... but I've long wanted to do more with these results. If I could derive which source columns each of those output columns were, there are a bunch of interesting things I could do, most notably:</p>
 
 If the output column is a known foreign key relationship, I could turn it into a hyperlink (as seen on <a href="https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures/roadside_attraction_characteristics">this table page</a>) 
 If the original table column has the new column metadata, I could display that as additional documentation 
 
<p>The challenge is: given an abitrary SQL query, how can I figure out what the resulting columns are going to be and how to tie those back to the original tables?</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://sqlite.org/forum/forumpost/482abd2e0f119555?t=h">a hint</a> from the SQLite forum I'm getting <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1293">tantalizingly close</a> to a solution.</p>
<p>The trick is to horribly abuse SQLite's <code>explain</code> output. Here's <a href="https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures?sql=explain+select%0D%0A++roadside_attractions.name%2C%0D%0A++roadside_attractions.address%2C%0D%0A++attraction_characteristic.name%0D%0Afrom%0D%0A++roadside_attraction_characteristics%0D%0A++join+roadside_attractions+on+roadside_attractions.pk+%3D+roadside_attraction_characteristics.attraction_id%0D%0A++join+attraction_characteristic+on+attraction_characteristic.pk+%3D+roadside_attraction_characteristics.characteristic_id">what it looks like</a> for the example query above:</p>

<p>The magic is on line 12: <code>ResultRow 3 3</code> means "return a result that spans three columns, starting at register 3" - so that's register 3, 4 and 5. Those three registers are populated by the <code>Column</code> operations on line 9, 10 and 11 (the register they write into is in the <code>p3</code> column). Each <code>Column</code> operation specifies the table (as <code>p1</code>) and the column index within that table (<code>p2</code>). And those table references map back to the <code>OpenRead</code> lines at the start, where <code>p1</code> is that table register (referered to by <code>Column</code>) and <code>p1</code> is the root page of the table within the schema.</p>
<p>Running <code>select rootpage, name from sqlite_master where rootpage in (45, 46, 47)</code> produces <a href="https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures?sql=select+rootpage%2C+name+from+sqlite_master+where+rootpage+in+%2845%2C+46%2C+47%29">the following</a>:</p>



rootpage

roadside_attractions

attraction_characteristic


47
roadside_attraction_characteristics



<p>Tie all of this together, and it may be possible to use <code>explain</code> to derive the original tables and columns for each of the outputs of an arbitrary query!</p>
<p>I was almost ready to declare victory, until I tried running it against a query with an <code>order by column</code> at the end... and the results no longer matched up.</p>
<p>You can follow <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1293#issuecomment-898524057">my ongoing investigation here</a> - the short version is that I think I'm going to have to learn to decode a whole bunch more opcodes before I can get this to work.</p>
<p>This is also a very risk way of attacking this problem. The SQLite <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/opcode.html">documentation for the bytecode engine</a> includes the following warning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This document describes SQLite internals. The information provided here is not needed for routine application development using SQLite. This document is intended for people who want to delve more deeply into the internal operation of SQLite.</p>
<p>The bytecode engine is not an API of SQLite. Details about the bytecode engine change from one release of SQLite to the next. Applications that use SQLite should not depend on any of the details found in this document.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it's pretty clear that this is a highly unsupported way of working with SQLite!</p>
<p>I'm still tempted to try it though. This feature is very much a nice-to-have: if it breaks and the additional column context stops displaying it's not a critical bug - and hopefully I'll be able to ship a Datasette update that takes into account those breaking SQLite changes relatively shortly afterwards.</p>
<p>If I can find another, more supported way to solve this I'll jump on it!</p>
<p>In the meantime, I did use this technque to solve a simpler problem. Datasette extracts <code>:named</code> parameters from arbitrary SQL queries and turns them <a href="https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures/neighborhood_search?_show_sql=1">into form fields</a> - but since it uses a simple regular expression for this it could be confused by things like a literal <code>00:04:05</code> time string contained in a SQL query.</p>
<p>The <code>explain</code> output for that query includes the following:</p>



addr
opcode
p1
p2
p3
p4
p5
comment




...
...
...
...
...
...
...
...


27
Variable
1
12
0
:text
0




<p>So I wrote some code which uses <code>explain</code> to extract just the <code>p4</code> operands from <code>Variable</code> columns and treats those as the extracted parameters! This feels a lot safer than the more complex <code>ResultRow</code>/<code>Column</code> logic - and it also falls back to the regular expression if it runs into any SQL errors.

   Re-assessing the automatic charset decoding policy in HTTPX 
 Tom Christie ran an analysis of the top 1,000 most accessed websites (according to an older extract from Google's Ad Planner service) and found that a full 5% of them both omitted a charset parameter and failed to decode as UTF-8.

  <p><a href="https://www.moxytongue.com/2012/02/what-is-sovereign-source-authority.html">Self-Sovereign Rights</a>, And The Function of USER:ID In Rights &amp; Derivative Laws For Mankind.</p><p>People never required a definition of the word "People" until recently. A Governed Civil Society constituted "of, by, for" people, seems obvious in its implications for design, interpretation, and amendment procedures. But apparently, this is not the case. The data structure of participation in a "Governed Civil Society" is very dependent on some baseline, foundational accuracies about the source origin of "Sovereign Rights".</p><p>This is not optional anymore. People, being organized as "People" and written into databases, contracts, and Governed State Trusts, represented as both paper &amp; digital artifacts, have become abstractions representing the original source authority required for the accurate processing of Sovereign authority. As these abstractions, written into documents via non-computational languages with historic precedent, become the priority mission for resolving "Civil Rights" in any Governed system designed "of, by, for" people, or "people", it is critical that the structure intended and inferred by language, become operational in the data structure that yields precedent in the real world where all Sovereign Rights matter. Rights are for people after all, not birth certificates.</p><p>Blood, mud, local community.. this is the home of Sovereign Rights. There is no alternative. It may seem as though digital technology is creating a new "metaverse" where new laws of nature are possible. Everything, as it will become obvious to understand in time, is made of data, and even emits data endlessly unto non-existence. People, you are the context. You are the reason data is being discovered, valued, harvested, manipulated, controlled, inspected, regulated, judicially reviewed, and entrepreneured in all the myriad ways possible to do, commercial, civic, social, health, education... the list is endless in time.</p><p>One thing never changes. One thing stays consistent. One thing matters for the sake of Humanity.</p><p>People own root authority, locally. Systems derived "of, by, for" people have a design constraint, and requirement for operational integrity. Words come and go, literature makes perfect what life makes real. You, an Individual person, are the only "people" that will ever actually exist. "We The People" may be a literary abstraction of reality, and it may be translated by a legal abstraction in time, but at the design and intent root level of it's meaning, "We The People" refers only to local people, in the real world, Individuals all.</p><p>That is the structural requirement. Our masses, our ability to coordinate as "We", or be perceived as "They", to form teams, to collaborate and build more perfect unions.. all of us, as Individuals, living among one another.. this is the only accurate structure of Sovereign Rights that are accurate to the design intent within a civil society derived "of, by, for" people, Individuals all.</p><p>Equality is a starting point of civil society. An accurate data structure yields accurate results in the hands of people. Individuals choose their path to happiness. Individuals choose to express their liberty. Individuals live life. Individuals are the only people alive on this planet, and at the data structure start of a Governed Civil System, all people are equal. Thats accurate law, thats accurate data structure.</p><p>Systems do not possess people. Systems are derived of, by for people. This is accurate fact. All formats of artificial intelligence known to mankind are derived from people, for people. Any data structure routine that runs counter to this accurate fact violates basic structural rights that people possess, as Individuals. Governments exist to enforce those Rights of, by for people, Individuals all.</p><p>In the year 2020++, there is great structural confusion about these words. One day, people will read these words and see them clearly. Clearly, they carry meaning. Clearly, they carry intent. All Human Rights are self-Sovereign in origin of authority, and this ultimate human authority is always locally expressed by Individuals. All limited liability structures derived by the consent of the people Governing Civil Society, and operationally participating in the accurate design of "Civil Society', are responsible for the return of value to the people, of, by, for and from which they emit. Any legal abstraction that removes the Sovereign Rights of people from "people" commits a crime of fraud on the people who civil society is "of, by, for", and their treatment under the derived Law of their Sovereign consent must transact "accurate authority" for people.</p><p>Currently, upon entering a unique relationship with Governed civil society via a USER:ID, discoverable within any IAM ID Management system in the world, and in use by Government processes to transact the Rights and permissions of citizens in their local purview, the data structure of your participation becomes "legal" and inaccurate. Governments, deriving their consent from the Governed, may design any data structure they wish in time. All Governments are to be held accountable for the accurate abstraction of human Rights and laws derived of, by for the people who produce it's authority of consent. People, Individuals All, is the only living reality.</p><p>Self-Sovereign Rights represent this accurate data structure of Governed Civil Society, whereby USER:ID is utilized to confer Rights Administration capabilities upon a populace of contextual people operating with local authority as Individual citizens, and non-citizen people with innate self-Sovereign Human Rights. A Nation such as America could not come into existence by any other data structure, and history itself serves as the ultimate precedent for establishing an operational context used in the very interpretation of Constitutional literature.</p><p>Working Groups, operating within non-governmental organizations or non-profit public benefit charities, exist as a layered dependency of such Governed systems. Their work is derived by the consent of the people, Individuals all, and as such, the accurate translation of their efforts is directly accountable to the accurate data structure outcomes of their local jurisdictional translations. America is not Europe, California is not New York. People, Individuals All, Always Local, Always Root Authority.</p><p>Data structure in a computational society Governed accurately "of, by, for" people requires local consent in all transactions and derived uses. The concept of an "open society" and a "secured society" can only co-exist if people are accurately represented. Otherwise, exploitation is the default condition of participation. Evidence can be found in the identity theft data, where babies with a social security number occupy a precarious artifact condition in a society construed as "Governed" and "Civil" as the #1 risk vector and systemic victim. The produced results of the current data structure of people in THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA is a travesty currently, and does not reflect the accurate data structure of the American people. An <a href="https://www.moxytongue.com/2021/07/recursive-signatory.html">error of omission</a> sits at the base of the stack affecting how Rights and Laws are translated, and conditioned as necessary.</p><p>People, Individuals All, operationally accurate as a data structure derived of, by for self-Sovereign human authority, expressed locally by people. This is the goal of work groups; consent receipts are an example of such work. Their accurate translation of contextual jurisdictional meaning will only be possible with a starting foundation of accurate self-Sovereign Rights, expressed by people locally. Systems must conform to reality.&nbsp;</p><p>People pursue lives of happiness, liberty, life... for people, in the real world, not as "people" abstractions required to conform to system designs that are computationally inaccurate. Data structures yield operational results. People own root authority in civil systems. It is not optional. Inaccuracy is unconstitutional, literally and operationally.</p><p>The Supreme Court is required to translate the meaning of the Law of THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, but has no self-comprehension of the inaccuracies present within the data structure of its jurisdictional authority. Systems don't think, systems don't innovate, systems don't iterate, amend, or get human intent correct in their design. People do, Individuals do, teams of Individuals do. Local people are the Self-Sovereign Rights holders and creators of Governed Civil Society, and in the absence of their accurate participation using an accurate data structure for expressing their human and civil Rights under Laws derived "of, by, for" their consent... well, welcome to 2020++ .. enjoy the loop.</p><p>An accurate operational data structure is a pre-requirement for the accurate translation of Sovereign Rights, Laws, and permissions administered in a civil system. All corporations and corporate systems are derived via the Governed process of Rights, Laws and permissions within a designed civil system, and the accurate translations of Laws affects the limitation of liability and expression of benefits for people within any and all local jurisdictions.</p><p>In short, until the data structure of the world is accurately represented in the Governed Civil Systems where USER:ID confers operational meaning to people, any civil system claiming to be derived "of, by, for" people is currently non-compliant, and unconstitutional in operational design. Self-Sovereign Rights are the origin of Governed Civil Systems derived "of, by, for" people, Individuals all.&nbsp;</p><p>Data structure yields operational results.. people own root.</p><p>I repeat, People, Individuals All, own root authority in any/all "Civil Systems" of Rights/Law administration.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>

<p>In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/07/24/pl-pgsql-versus-pl-python-heres-why-im-using-both-to-write-postgres-functions/">episode 2</a> I mentioned three aspects of pl/python that are reasons to use it instead of pl/pgsql: access to Python modules, metaprogramming, and introspection.</p>
<p>Although this episode focuses on metaprogramming — by which I mean using Python to dynamically compose and run SQL queries — my favorite example combines all three aspects.</p>
<p>The context for the example is an analytics dashboard with a dozen panels, each driven by a pl/plython function that’s parameterized by the id of a school or a course. So, for example, the Questions and Answers panel on the course dashboard is driven by a function, questions_and_answers_for_group(group_id), which wraps a SQL query that:</p>
<p>– calls another pl/python function, questions_for_group(group_id), to find notes in the group that contain question marks</p>
<p>– finds the replies to those notes</p>
<p>– builds a table that summarizes the question/answer pairs</p>
<p>Here’s the SQL wrapped by the questions_and_answers_for_group(group_id) function.</p>
 sql = f"""
  with questions as ( 
    select *
    from questions_for_group('{_group_id}')
    ),
  ids_and_refs as (
    select 
      id,
      unnest ("references") as ref
      from annotation
      where groupid = '{_group_id}'
  ),
  combined as (
    select
      q.*,
      array_agg(ir.id) as reply_ids
    from ids_and_refs ir
    inner join questions q on q.id = ir.ref
    group by q.id, q.url, q.title, q.questioner, q.question, q.quote
  ),
  unnested as (
    select
      c.url,
      c.title,
      c.quote,
      c.questioner,
      c.question,
      unnest(reply_ids) as reply_id
    from combined c
  )
  select distinct
    course_for_group('{_group_id}') as course,
    teacher_for_group('{_group_id}') as teacher,
    clean_url(u.url) as url,
    u.title,
    u.quote,
    u.questioner,
    (regexp_matches(u.question, '.+\?'))[1] as question,
    display_name_from_anno(u.reply_id) as answerer,
    text_from_anno(u.reply_id) as answer,
    app_host() || '/course/render_questions_and_answers/{_group_id}' as viewer
  from unnested u
  order by course, teacher, url, title, questioner, question
 
<p>This isn’t yet what I mean by pl/python metaprogramming. You could as easily wrap this SQL code in a pl/pgsql function. More easily, in fact, because in pl/pgsql you could just write _group_id instead of '{_group_id}'.</p>
<p>To get where we’re going, let’s zoom out and look at the whole questions_and_and_answer_for_group(group_id) function.</p>
 questions_and_answers_for_group(_group_id text)
  returns setof question_and_answer_for_group as $$
  from plpython_helpers import (
    exists_group_view,
    get_caller_name,
    memoize_view_name
  )
  base_view_name = get_caller_name()
  view_name = f'{base_view_name}_{_group_id}'
  if exists_group_view(plpy, view_name):
    sql = f""" select * from {view_name} """
  else:
    sql = f"""
    &lt;SEE ABOVE&gt;
    """
    memoize_view_name(sql, view_name)
    sql = f""" select * from {view_name} """
  return plpy.execute(sql)
$$ language plpython3u;
 
<p>This still isn’t what I mean by metaprogramming. It introduces introspection — this is a pl/python function that discovers its own name and works with an eponymous materialized view — but that’s for a later episode.</p>
<p>It also introduces the use of Python modules by pl/python functions. A key thing to note here is that this is an example of what I call a memoizing function. When called it looks for a materialized view that captures the results of the SQL query shown above. If yes, it only needs to use a simple SELECT to return the cached result. If no, it calls memoize_view_name to run the underlying query and cache it in a materialized view that the next call to questions_and_answers_for_group(group_id) will use in a simple SELECT. Note that memoize_view_name is a special function that isn’t defined in Postgres using CREATE FUNCTION foo() like a normal pl/python function. Instead it’s defined using def foo() in a Python module called plpython_helpers. The functions there can do things — like create materialized views — that pl/python functions can’t. More about that in another episode.</p>
<p>The focus in this episode is metaprogramming, which is used in this example to roll up the results of multiple calls to questions_and_answers_for_group(group_id). That happens when the group_id refers to a course that has sections. If you’re teaching the course and you’ve got students in a dozen sections, you don’t want to look at a dozen dashboards; you’d much rather see everything on the primary course dashboard.</p>
<p>Here’s the function that does that consolidation.</p>
 create function consolidated_questions_and_answers_for_group(group_id text)
  returns setof question_and_answer_for_group as $$
  from plpython_helpers import (
    get_caller_name,
    sql_for_consolidated_and_memoized_function_for_group
  )
  base_view_name = get_caller_name()
  sql = sql_for_consolidated_and_memoized_function_for_group(
    plpy, base_view_name, 'questions_and_answers_for_group', _group_id)
  sql += ' order by course, url, title, questioner, answerer'
  return plpy.execute(sql)
$$ language plpython3u;
 
<p>This pl/python function not only memoizes its results as above, it also consolidates results for all sections of a course. The memoization happens here.</p>
 def sql_for_consolidated_and_memoized_function_for_group(plpy, 
    base_view_name, function, group_id):
  view_name = f'{base_view_name}_{group_id}'
  sql = f""" select exists_view('{view_name}') as exists """
  exists = row_zero_value_for_colname(plpy, sql, 'exists')
  if exists:
    sql = f""" select * from {view_name} """
  else:
    sql = consolidator_for_group_as_sql(plpy, group_id, function)
    memoize_view_name(sql, view_name)
    sql = f""" select * from {view_name} """
  return sql
 
<p>The consolidation happens here, and this is finally what I think of as classical metaprogramming: using Python to compose SQL.</p>
 def consolidator_for_group_as_sql(plpy, _group_id, _function):
  sql = f"select type_for_group('{_group_id}') as type"
  type = row_zero_value_for_colname(plpy, sql, 'type')
  if type == 'section_group' or type == 'none':
    sql = f"select * from {_function}('{_group_id}')"
  if type == 'course_group' or type == 'course':
    sql = f"select has_sections('{_group_id}')"
    has_sections = row_zero_value_for_colname(plpy, sql, 'has_sections')
    if has_sections:
      sql = f"""
        select array_agg(group_id) as group_ids 
        from sections_for_course('{_group_id}')
      """
      group_ids = row_zero_value_for_colname(plpy, sql, 'group_ids')
      selects = [f"select * from {_function}('{_group_id}') "]
      for group_id in group_ids:
        selects.append(f"select * from {_function}('{group_id}')")
      sql = ' union '.join(selects)
    else:
      sql = f"select * from {_function}('{_group_id}')"
  return sql

 
<p>If the inbound _groupid is p1mqaeep, the inbound _function is questions_and_answers_for_group, and the group has no sections, the SQL will just be select * from questions_and_answers_for_group('p1mqaeep').</p>
<p>If the group does have sections, then the SQL will instead look like this:</p>
 select * from questions_and_answers_for_group('p1mqaeep')
union 
select * from questions_and_answers_for_group('x7fe93ba')
union
select * from questions_and_answers_for_group('qz9a4b3d')
 
<p>This is a very long-winded way of saying that pl/python is an effective way to compose and run arbitarily complex SQL code. In theory you could do the same thing using pl/pgsql, in practice it would be insane to try. I’ve entangled the example with other aspects — modules, introspection — because that’s the real situation. pl/python’s maximal power emerges from the interplay of all three aspects. That said, it’s a fantastic way to extend Postgres with user-defined functions that compose and run SQL code.</p>

I've deliberately avoided building this kind of documentation in the past because I so often see projects where the class reference is the ONLY documentation, which I find makes it really hard to figure out how to actually use it. sqlite-utils already has extensive narrative prose documentation so in this case I think it's a useful enhancement - especially since the docstrings and type hints can help improve the usability of the library in IDEs and Jupyter notebooks.</p>

   Bare columns in an aggregate queries 
 This is a really nice SQL tweak implemented in SQLite: If you run a query like "SELECT a, b, max(c) FROM tab1 GROUP BY a" SQLite will find the row with the highest value for c and use the columns of that row as the returned values for the other columns mentioned in the query.

  <p>Summary:      Many of the relationships we have online don’t have to be long-lived. Ephemeral relationships, offering virtual anonymity, are technically possible without a loss of functionality or convenience. Why don’t they exist? Surveillance is profitable.</p>



<p>
    In real life, we often interact with others—both people and institutions—with relative anonymity. For example, if I go the store and use cash to buy a coke there is no exchange of identity information. Even if I use a credit card it's rarely the case that the entire transaction happens under the administrative authority of the identity system inherent in the credit card. Only the financial part of the transaction takes place in that identity system. This is true of most interactions in real life.
</p>

<p>
    I don't have an account at the local grocery store where I store my address, credit card, and other information so that each transaction is linked to a record about me. True, many businesses have loyalty programs and use those to collect information about customers, but those are optional. And going without one doesn't significantly inconvenience me. In fact, the point of the credit card system is that it avoids long-lived relationships between any of the parties except the customer (or merchant) and their bank. 
</p>

<p>
    In real life, we do without identity systems for most things. You don't have to identify yourself to the movie theater to watch a movie or log into some administrative system to sit in a restaurant and have a private conversation with friends. In real life, we act as embodied, independent agents. Our physical presence and the laws of physics have a lot to do with our ability to function with workable anonymity across many domains.
</p>

<p>
    One of the surprising things about identity in the physical world is that so many of the relationships are ephemeral rather than long-lived. While the ticket taker at the movies and the server at the restaurant certainly "identify" patrons, they forget them as soon as the transaction is complete. And the identification is likely pseudonymous (e.g. "the couple at table four" rather than "Phillip and Lynne Windley"). These interactions are effectively anonymous. 
</p>

<p>
    Of course, in the digital world, very few meaningful transactions are done outside of some administrative identity system. There are <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/05/life-like_anonymity_and_the_poison_web.shtml#anonymity">several reasons why identity is so important in the digital world</a>. But we've accepted long-lived relationships with full legibility of patrons as the default on the web. 
</p>

<p>
    Some of that is driven by convenience. I like storing my credit cards and shipping info at Amazon because it's convenient. I like that they know what books I've bought so I don't buy the same book more than once (yeah, I'm that guy). But what if I could get that convenience without any kind of account at Amazon at all? That's the promise of verifiable credentials and self-sovereign identity. 
</p>

<p>
    You can imagine an ecommerce company that keeps no payment or address information on customers, but is still able to process their orders and send the merchandise. If my shipping information and credit card information are stored as verifiable credentials in a digital wallet I control, I can easily provide these to whatever web site I need to as needed. No need to have them stored. And we <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2009/04/ill_send_you_a_card_information_cards_in_the_wild.shtml">demonstrated way back in 2009 a way to augment results from a web site with a self-sovereign data store</a>. That could tell me what I already own as I navigate a site.
</p>

<p>
    There's no technical reason we need long-lived relationships for most of our web interactions. That doesn't mean we won't want some for convenience, but they ought to be optional, like the loyalty program at the supermarket, rather than required for service. Our digital lives can be as private as our physical lives if we choose for them to be. We don't have to allow companies to surveil us. And the excuse that they surveil us to provide better service is just that—an excuse. The real reason they surveil us is because it's profitable.

<p>This article shows how to use Microsoft Graph API to send emails for a .NET Core Desktop WPF application. Microsoft.Identity.Client is used to authenticate using an Azure App registration with the required delegated scopes for the Graph API. The emails can be sent with text or html bodies and also with any file attachments uploaded in the WPF application.</p>



<p>Code:  <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/EmailCalandarsClient">https://github.com/damienbod/EmailCalandarsClient</a></p>



<p>To send emails using Microsoft Graph API, you need to have an office license for the Azure Active Directory user which sends the email.</p>



<p>You can sign-in here to check this:</p>



<p><a href="https://www.office.com">https://www.office.com</a></p>



<p>Setup the Azure App Registration</p>



<p>Before we can send emails using Microsoft Graph API, we need to create an Azure App registration with the correct delegated scopes. In our example, the URI <a href="http://localhost:65419">http://localhost:65419</a> is used for the AAD redirect to the browser opened by the WPF application and this is added to the authentication configuration.  Once created, the client ID of the Azure App registration is used in the app settings in the application as well as the tenant ID and the scopes.</p>







<p>You need to add the required scopes for the Graph API to send emails. These are delegated permissions, which can be accessed using the Add a permission menu.</p>







<p>The Mail.Send and the Mail.ReadWrite delegated scopes from the Microsoft Graph API are added to the Azure App registration.</p>







<p>To add these, scroll down through the items in the App a permission, Microsoft Graph API delegated scopes menu, check the checkboxes for the Mail.Send and the Mail.ReadWrite.</p>







<p>Desktop Application</p>



<p>The Microsoft.Identity.Client and the Microsoft.Identity.Web.MicrosoftGraphBeta Nuget packages are used to authenticate and use the Graph API. You probably could use the Graph API Nuget packages directly instead of  Microsoft.Identity.Web.MicrosoftGraphBeta, I used this since I normally do web and it has everything required.</p>


  &lt;ItemGroup&gt;
  &lt;PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Identity.Client" Version="4.35.1" /&gt;
  &lt;PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Identity.Web.MicrosoftGraphBeta" Version="1.15.2" /&gt;
  &lt;PackageReference Include="Newtonsoft.Json" Version="13.0.1" /&gt;
&lt;/ItemGroup&gt;
  


<p>The PublicClientApplicationBuilder class is used to define the redirect URL which matches the URL from the Azure App registration. The TokenCacheHelper class is the same as from the Microsoft examples.</p>


  public void InitClient()
{
  _app = PublicClientApplicationBuilder.Create(ClientId)
            .WithAuthority(Authority)
            .WithRedirectUri("http://localhost:65419")
            .Build();

  TokenCacheHelper.EnableSerialization(_app.UserTokenCache);
}
  


<p>The identity can authentication using the SignIn method. If a server session exists, a token is acquired silently otherwise an interactive flow is used.</p>


  public async Task&lt;IAccount&gt; SignIn()
{
	try
	{
		var result = await AcquireTokenSilent();
		return result.Account;
	}
	catch (MsalUiRequiredException)
	{
		return await AcquireTokenInteractive().ConfigureAwait(false);
	}
}

private async Task&lt;IAccount&gt; AcquireTokenInteractive()
{
	var accounts = (await _app.GetAccountsAsync()).ToList();

	var builder = _app.AcquireTokenInteractive(Scopes)
		.WithAccount(accounts.FirstOrDefault())
		.WithUseEmbeddedWebView(false)
		.WithPrompt(Microsoft.Identity.Client.Prompt.SelectAccount);

	var result = await builder.ExecuteAsync().ConfigureAwait(false);

	return result.Account;
}

public async Task&lt;AuthenticationResult&gt; AcquireTokenSilent()
{
	var accounts = await GetAccountsAsync();
	var result = await _app.AcquireTokenSilent(Scopes, accounts.FirstOrDefault())
			.ExecuteAsync()
			.ConfigureAwait(false);

	return result;
}
  


<p>The SendEmailAsync method uses a message object and Graph API to send the emails. If the identity has the permissions, the licenses and is authenticated, then an email will be sent using the definitions from the Message class.</p>


  public async Task SendEmailAsync(Message message)
{
	var result = await AcquireTokenSilent();

	_httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization 
		= new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", result.AccessToken);
	_httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Accept.Add(
		new MediaTypeWithQualityHeaderValue("application/json"));

	GraphServiceClient graphClient = new GraphServiceClient(_httpClient)
	{
		AuthenticationProvider = new DelegateAuthenticationProvider(async (requestMessage) =&gt;
		{
			requestMessage.Headers.Authorization 
				= new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", result.AccessToken);
		})
	};

	var saveToSentItems = true;

	await graphClient.Me
		.SendMail(message, saveToSentItems)
		.Request()
		.PostAsync();
}
  


<p>The EmailService class is used to added the recipient, header (subject) and the body to the message which represents the email. The attachments are added separately using the MessageAttachmentsCollectionPage class. The AddAttachment method is used to add as many attachments to the email as required which are uploaded as a base64 byte array. The service can send html bodies or text bodies.</p>


  public class EmailService
{
	MessageAttachmentsCollectionPage MessageAttachmentsCollectionPage 
		= new MessageAttachmentsCollectionPage();

	public Message CreateStandardEmail(string recipient, string header, string body)
	{
		var message = new Message
		{
			Subject = header,
			Body = new ItemBody
			{
				ContentType = BodyType.Text,
				Content = body
			},
			ToRecipients = new List&lt;Recipient&gt;()
			{
				new Recipient
				{
					EmailAddress = new EmailAddress
					{
						Address = recipient
					}
				}
			},
			Attachments = MessageAttachmentsCollectionPage
		};

		return message;
	}

	public Message CreateHtmlEmail(string recipient, string header, string body)
	{
		var message = new Message
		{
			Subject = header,
			Body = new ItemBody
			{
				ContentType = BodyType.Html,
				Content = body
			},
			ToRecipients = new List&lt;Recipient&gt;()
			{
				new Recipient
				{
					EmailAddress = new EmailAddress
					{
						Address = recipient
					}
				}
			},
			Attachments = MessageAttachmentsCollectionPage
		};

		return message;
	}

	public void AddAttachment(byte[] rawData, string filePath)
	{
		MessageAttachmentsCollectionPage.Add(new FileAttachment
		{
			Name = Path.GetFileName(filePath),
			ContentBytes = EncodeTobase64Bytes(rawData)
		});
	}

	public void ClearAttachments()
	{
		MessageAttachmentsCollectionPage.Clear();
	}

	static public byte[] EncodeTobase64Bytes(byte[] rawData)
	{
		string base64String = System.Convert.ToBase64String(rawData);
		var returnValue = Convert.FromBase64String(base64String);
		return returnValue;
	}
}
  


<p>Azure App Registration settings</p>



<p>The app settings specific to your Azure Active Directory tenant and the Azure App registration values need to be added to the app settings in the .NET Core application. The Scope configuration is set to use the required scopes required to send emails.</p>


  &lt;appSettings&gt;
	&lt;add key="AADInstance" value="https://login.microsoftonline.com/{0}/v2.0"/&gt;
	&lt;add key="Tenant" value="5698af84-5720-4ff0-bdc3-9d9195314244"/&gt;
	&lt;add key="ClientId" value="ae1fd165-d152-492d-b4f5-74209f8f724a"/&gt;
	&lt;add key="Scope" value="User.read Mail.Send Mail.ReadWrite"/&gt;
&lt;/appSettings&gt;
  


<p>WPF UI</p>



<p>The WPF application provides an Azure AD login for the identity. The user of the WPF application can sign-in using a browser which redirects to the AAD authentication page. Once authenticated, the user can send a html email or a text email. The AddAttachment method uses the OpenFileDialog to upload a file in the WPF application, get the raw bytes and add these to the attachments which are sent with the next email message. Once the email is sent, the attachments are removed.</p>


  public partial class MainWindow : Window
{
	AadGraphApiDelegatedClient _aadGraphApiDelegatedClient = new AadGraphApiDelegatedClient();
	EmailService _emailService = new EmailService();

	const string SignInString = "Sign In";
	const string ClearCacheString = "Clear Cache";

	public MainWindow()
	{
		InitializeComponent();
		_aadGraphApiDelegatedClient.InitClient();
	}

	private async void SignIn(object sender = null, RoutedEventArgs args = null)
	{
		var accounts = await _aadGraphApiDelegatedClient.GetAccountsAsync();

		if (SignInButton.Content.ToString() == ClearCacheString)
		{
			await _aadGraphApiDelegatedClient.RemoveAccountsAsync();

			SignInButton.Content = SignInString;
			UserName.Content = "Not signed in";
			return;
		}

		try
		{
			var account = await _aadGraphApiDelegatedClient.SignIn();

			Dispatcher.Invoke(() =&gt;
			{
				SignInButton.Content = ClearCacheString;
				SetUserName(account);
			});
		}
		catch (MsalException ex)
		{
			if (ex.ErrorCode == "access_denied")
			{
				// The user canceled sign in, take no action.
			}
			else
			{
				// An unexpected error occurred.
				string message = ex.Message;
				if (ex.InnerException != null)
				{
					message += "Error Code: " + ex.ErrorCode + "Inner Exception : " + ex.InnerException.Message;
				}

				MessageBox.Show(message);
			}

			Dispatcher.Invoke(() =&gt;
			{
				UserName.Content = "Not signed in";
			});
		}
	}

	private async void SendEmail(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
	{
		var message = _emailService.CreateStandardEmail(EmailRecipientText.Text, 
			EmailHeader.Text, EmailBody.Text);

		await _aadGraphApiDelegatedClient.SendEmailAsync(message);
		_emailService.ClearAttachments();
	}

	private async void SendHtmlEmail(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
	{
		var messageHtml = _emailService.CreateHtmlEmail(EmailRecipientText.Text,
			EmailHeader.Text, EmailBody.Text);

		await _aadGraphApiDelegatedClient.SendEmailAsync(messageHtml);
		_emailService.ClearAttachments();
	}

	private void AddAttachment(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
	{
		var dlg = new OpenFileDialog();
		if (dlg.ShowDialog() == true)
		{
			byte[] data = File.ReadAllBytes(dlg.FileName);
			_emailService.AddAttachment(data, dlg.FileName);
		}
	}

	private void SetUserName(IAccount userInfo)
	{
		string userName = null;

		if (userInfo != null)
		{
			userName = userInfo.Username;
		}

		if (userName == null)
		{
			userName = "Not identified";
		}

		UserName.Content = userName;
	}
}
  


<p>Running the application</p>



<p>When the application is started, the user can sign-in using the Sign in button.</p>







<p>The standard Azure AD login is used in a popup browser. Once the authentication is completed, the browser redirect sends the tokens back to the application.</p>







<p>If a file attachment needs to be sent, the Add Attachment button can be used. This opens up a dialog and any single file can be selected.</p>







<p>When the email is sent successfully, the email and the file can be viewed in the recipients inbox. The emails are also saved to the senders sent emails. This can be disabled if required. </p>

  <p>Individual Rights are hard to come by historically. Strong people make them possible. First requirement of their existence is thus, strong people. Weak and fearful people tend to group together for support initially, and then like crabs in a bucket, to prevent others from escaping the huddle of their security perception. For the purposes of "Individual Rights", this tribal, fearful, mob enforced compliance and perceptual safety is an enemy of fulfilling the experience of those "Individual Rights".&nbsp;</p><p>Individual liberty is the expression of "Individual Rights". A Sovereign Nation derived "of, by, for" people with "Individual Rights" defined broadly as "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness", and given contextual authority as "unalienable" and "self-evident" in nature, must inherently emit from the Individual people that such a Sovereign Nation is composed of. This is the foundational reality of America.&nbsp;</p><p>Conversely, mob rule is an expression of mob authority. When a "Bill Of Rights" sets out the 1st Right as the "freedom of speech", it is further evidence of the foundational intent of it's authors, all Individual people expressing "Individual Rights" in defining their own Sovereign authority. Therefore, when the Government derived "of, by, for" such people yields corporate charters, and under incorporated Sovereign State Law produces administrative methods of corporate employment, such that "freedom of speech" no longer belongs directly to people, Individuals all, but instead, administratively recasts a person as an employee with provisioned Rights of the State, something is askew. Many such "provisioned Rights" exist, but of greater consequence to the civil society resulting from the original founding intent and structural declarations with Constitutional authority, this administrative process enforces a new type of "mob rule" onto people, and their infrastructure supporting their "Rights" under Sovereign Law.</p><p>Mob rule can thus operate with 50.1% efficiency. A bicameral legislative body can be socially engineered into an expression of mob rule via a two party political system, whereby the people, Individuals all, no longer are the authorities in expressing their Sovereign Rights, except by replacement of new members who inherently are leveraged into joining existing mob rule parties. Independent people, Individual people with "Individual Rights" who serve their peers and civil Society are reduced to functionaries of the mob ruling political party system. All consensus is among the two parties, and the Institution of Governance is no longer directly representative of the best interests of the people, Individuals All. Instead, people reduce their participation to fit into the priorities of the two parties with mob rule authority in the bicameral legislative body.</p><p>Lookup "Republican" and "Democrat" in the text of the Constitution of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA and Declaration of Independence for yourself. What "Rights" are conveyed "of, by, for" these political parties as representations of the people?</p>  <br><p>Mob Rule is the "Way We Go Down". Individual Rights is our victory, and salvation.</p><p>All of human history is reducible to the fight between mob rule and the Individual expression of human Rights. Mobs hate people. Let it set in.. mobs are afraid of people, Individuals all. Movies as esoteric as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footloose_(1984_film)">Footloose</a> document repeatedly the fear the mob holds for Individuals expressing their freedoms. Mobs are the reduction of human intelligence, to the common baseline of fear, control, subservience, and domination of the human spirit within every Individual.</p><p>The fight for Individual Rights is one of control; how do Individuals control their own authority? The struggle against mob rule, against communist or socialist practices that squander human freedom in search for mob security, is one of eternal merit protecting that which makes humanity redeemable. Enslavement of humans by humans, written into the DNA of progress itself, manifesting destinies for all people, is only redeemable, forgivable, and teachable if the value it produces extends the power of Individual Rights to all people.</p><p>[Revised Appropriately]:</p><p>"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all mankind is created equal and endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are life, liberty and the personal pursuit of happiness. Governments exist to guarantee the Rights of, by, and for such people, Individuals all, and no abstraction of literary, or mathematical form, shall in any way distort the meaning of such human authority by people, Individuals all."</p><p>America has a literary problem; "We the People" is a term of abstraction. "We the People" has been abstracted by legalese into a meaning that is out-of-step with observable reality. "We the People" are not a data aggregation algorithmic result, "We the People" are not a legal entity/State or one-off representation of authority. "We the people" are Individuals all, and together as people, Individuals all living among one another, our personal authority has constructed a Government that must work by the efforts of the people it is for&nbsp;as was declared, constituted and enforced by great personal action on the part of many people, Individuals all.</p><p>Degradation of people, Individuals all, to instruments of mob rule is out-of-step with the intent for the existence of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, and the use of political parties to induce cult-like mob authority in lieu of accountability to the actual structural integrity of people must be amended. The people must be defined accurately. As it was unacceptable to declare "All men equal.." and not include women or non-white people in that definition, so too is it inappropriate to cause "We the People" to be translated in any way other than may be observed by a child in nature. People exist as Individuals only, and any Union made more perfect must reflect this fact in its operational constraints, dependencies, protocols, policies, Laws and methods of enforcing human Rights.</p><p>America's greatest power is it's conceptualization of people with Individual Rights. Our "more perfect Union" is materialized only through the expression of these Individual Rights for all of it's people, as well as the opportunity for it's expression for all the people of planet Earth. Like a siphon pulling the greatest minds towards its gravitational center, to compete on a planet where American Rights for all exist is the greatest human opportunity to build upon human empowerment the world has ever known.</p><p>The American people, Individuals all, have enemies lined up against them. This is unlikely to change so long as fearful, greedy, an life-reducing bureaucrats are in a position to exercise their contrived authority resulting from practices of mob rule. All that any person need do to observe the reality of any "leader" extending any "policy" or practice affecting the lives of people is to interrogate the operation to find out how human power is distributed. If power is taken from people and given to a central power-processing entity to re-distribute to people defined differently than all others are by default, you are looking at a function of mob rule. If a person suggests that people, Individuals all, are not accountable for their own freedom, and can shirk their personal responsibilities to care for the babies, toddlers, young people, or elderly in need of human guardianship evoked from the sustaining love that gave them life, you are listening to an agent of mob rule.</p><p>Any act that induces mob rule is in support of mob rule.</p><p>Any act that sustains Individual Liberty is in support of Individual Rights.</p><p>Can you interpret reality?</p><p>Data is the dirt of digital existence; everything is made of data. Data is the carbon of digital existence; everything that matters to Humanity is made of data. Individual Rights are made of data, and when it comes to Individual Rights, structure yields results. Human authority is sourced directly from people, Individuals all. People are the source of Sovereign authority, or mob rule is being leveraged. It is that simple.</p><p>When designing a data structure to operate the Rights mechanisms of a Governing entity within a civil society enabled "of, by, for" people, Individuals all, both in bureaucratic Terms as well as in the processing of managing a Governance body composed of an Executive, Legislate and Judicial branch, the key constraint is the source of "useful identity". The useful identity is the primary key of both freedom and security for people within their own Governance bureaucracy where data is leveraged contextually of, by, for all making such a more perfect Union possible.</p><p>America's "Founding Fathers" gave the origin of this procession physical form, both for a King, as well as for every King's Administration System, or Government, that would ever exist henceforth. John Hancock made sure to write it large so no one would miss it. These people got it right the first time around, but an error of omission has caused the same procession to fail to keep repeating. People, Individuals all, have been denied the same opportunity afforded in the original declaration, and in the absence of a "recursive signatory event", one that repeats generation after generation, second class participants have been made of "We the People" as abstractions of legal literature.</p><p>You must originate your own <a href="https://www.moxytongue.com/2012/02/what-is-sovereign-source-authority.html">Sovereign source authority</a> via a <a href="https://www.moxytongue.com/2021/07/recursive-signatory.html">recursive signatory</a> made "of, by, for" your own Governance, as a person, an Individual. All of us, living among one another must be equal in this origin of personal authority, as our participatory rights are founded on the accurate definition of "We the People", Individuals all.</p><p>Women and men, equal people in the eyes of the law, Individuals all; No exceptions under American Law.</p><p>There is no alternative that yields an American citizen. If the next century is indeed a great global competition between America and China, let it be fought on the grounds of its inherent construct:&nbsp;</p><p>People, Individuals All with Individual Rights</p><p>Vs</p><p>Authoritarian Enforced Mob Rule managed by fear and control of Individual Rights.</p><p>Internally, within any civil society claiming to represent people as freedom loving beings, pay attention to the practices used to enforce/empower the authority making Individual Rights possible. The past is made of many painful mistakes, mis-definitions, and missed opportunities, but today is for people, Individuals all, to get the story Right.&nbsp;</p><p>Individual Rights come from people, Individuals All. There is no other possibility.&nbsp;</p><p>ID:DATA is the primary key of both freedom and security in a civil society. People must own root authority over their ID:DATA. The structure of your data existence must match the inherent structure of your Individual Rights. Individual Rights come from people. Individual ID:DATA Rights come from people, Individuals all.</p><p>America comes from self-Sovereign human authority, defined generation after generation of, by, for those people. Expressing your Rights is a recursive act with an origin story. Make sure you own root. Mob rule is hunting your life, protect yourself. Protect the possibility of your more perfect Union.</p><p><a href="https://www.moxytongue.com/2021/06/all-along-watchtower.html">Be Vigilant..</a></p><p><br></p>

<p>A Response to the&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060930021810/http://www.livingworlds.com/">Documentation of the Living Worlds Working Group</a><br>1997-02-27</p>



<p>[A post by Douglas Crockford, recovered from the internet archive.]</p>



 Introduction 



<p>The Livings Worlds Initiative is the work of a small but dedicated group of&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060930021810/http://vag.vrml.org/consort/">VRML</a>&nbsp;developers who have a deep interest in extending VRML into the basis for interconnected virtual worlds. This project has been inextricably bound to a very effective public relations campaign and standards setting effort. The project is still in development, but is already being promoted as an industry standard for virtual worlds.</p>



<p>The Living Worlds Working Group has been signing up a large number of companies as&nbsp;supporters&nbsp;of the effort, including IBM and Apple. What is not clear to most observers is that&nbsp;support&nbsp;means nothing more than agreeing that standards are desirable.</p>



<p>Within the industry, there is common misunderstanding of what support for Living Worlds means, even among the supporters. The result is that support for a Livings Worlds Standard is starting to snowball. It is being regarded as a proposed standard, but it has not had to face any sort of rigorous review. The purpose of this response is to begin the belated review of the Living Worlds Documentation as a proposed standard.</p>



 Premature Standardization 



<p>There is a growing list of companies that are developing VRML-based virtual worlds. The sector is attracting a lot of attention. Even so, most of the social activity on the Internet today is in IRC and the chat rooms of&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060930021810/http://www.aol.com/">AOL</a>. The most successfully socialized avatar worlds are&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060930021810/http://www.worldsaway.com/">WorldsAway</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060930021810/http://www.thepalace.com/">The Palace</a>, neither of which are VRML-based. The VRML worlds have seen a lot of churn, but are not creating significant sustaining communities.</p>



<p>The weakness of community formation in many of the VRML worlds may be the result of the newness of the worlds and the inexperience of the world designers, who have hampered themselves by putting 3D graphics ahead of socialization.</p>



<p>It is too early to be standardizing 3D social architecture. More experimentation is required. If the Living Worlds Initiative is an experiment conducted by a group of cooperating companies, then it is a good thing. If it is a standard-setting activity, then it is premature and harmful.</p>



<p>The operation of 3D worlds has not been shown to be a profitable activity. The business model is driven by affection for Neal Stephenson’s satiric cyberpunk novel,&nbsp;Snow Crash. Snow Crash&nbsp;describes a virtual world called the Metaverse. Some day, we may have a real Metaverse, and it might even be as important in our world as it was in the novel.</p>



<p>Living Worlds does not implement the Metaverse. It only makes something that looks like it, a meta-virtual world.</p>



<p>VRML itself is still new. VRML 2.0 was announced at Siggraph 96, and complete implementations are only now coming on line. The VRML 2.0 initiative was as frenzied as the Living Worlds Initiative, and because of the haste, the result was suboptimal. A consequence is that part of the Living Worlds Initiative contains some workarounds for VRML 2.0 limitations.</p>



 Security 



<p>The word “security” does not occur in the Living Worlds Documentation except to point out a security hole in VRML 2.0. The lack of attention to security by the Living Worlds Working Group is not a problem if the Initiative is viewed as an experiment. One of the benefits of the experiment will be to demonstrate why security is critical in the design of distributed systems. If the Living Worlds Initiative is setting a standard, then it is harmful.</p>



<p>Security is a very complicated and subtle subject. Absolute security is never achievable, but diligent design and application can produce systems which are worthy of trust.</p>



<p>The Living Worlds Documentation identifies three issues in which distributed security is critical.</p>



  handle everything via dynamically downloaded Java applets  protect the local scene from damage by imported objects  support authentication certificates (dice, business cards)  



<p>The Documentation does not adequately address any of those issues.</p>



<p>Lacking security at the lowest levels, Living Worlds is not strong enough to offer a credible trust model at the human-interaction level. In systems which can be hacked, concepts like identity, credentials, and accountability are meaningless.</p>



<p>This severely limits the application scope of Living Worlds. Environments which permit interpersonal commerce or confidential collaboration should not be implemented in Living Worlds.</p>



 Secure software distribution 



<p>Software is the lifeblood of virtual communities. The value and diversity of these systems depend on the ability to dynamically load and execute software from the network. Unfortunately, this raises a huge security concern. Software from the network could contain viruses, trojan horses, and other security threats. Because of the dynamic and interconnected nature of virtual communities,&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060930021810/http://www.cs.princeton.edu/sip/pub/secure96.html">the protection mechanisms provided by Java are not adequate.</a></p>



<p>The Living Worlds Documentation notes that</p>



<blockquote><p>…at present, most systems prohibit Java from accessing local files, which makes it impossible, for example, to connect to locally installed third party software features. Until this problem is generically solved by the Java community, the management of downloads and local access are left to proprietary MUtech solutions.</p></blockquote>



<p>The proprietary MUtech solutions will create a security hole, and possibly compromise the goal of interoperability at the same time. In order for the dynamic, distributed virtual community to be viable, the issue of secure software distribution must be solved from the outset.&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060930021810/http://www.packet.com/garfinkel/96/47/index2a.html">Class signing is not a solution.</a>&nbsp;A secure, distributed architecture is required. It is doubtful that credible security mechanisms can be retrofitted later.</p>



 Protect the local scene 



<p>Related to the problem of software distribution is the question of rights granted to objects. Objects that are valued in some places might be obnoxious or dangerous in others. The Living Worlds Documentation describes&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060930021810/http://www.livingworlds.com/draft_1/lw_ideas.htm#Requirements">an incontinent puppy</a>&nbsp;as an example of such an object. A secure architecture needs to deal with these sorts of issues from the outset. The Living Worlds Documentation identifies the problem, but does not solve it.</p>



 Authentication 



<p>The Living Worlds Documentation calls for the use of authentication certificates as a mechanism for assuring confidence in certain objects. Unfortunately, if the architecture is not secure, there is not a reliable context in which certificates can be trusted. Because Living Worlds is hackable, certified objects can be compromised.</p>



 Community 



<p>Communities need tools with which they can create policies to regulate the social order. Different communities will have different needs, conventions, standards. The Living Worlds Documentation says this about the task of designing those tools:</p>



<blockquote><p>Two things seem clear. First, that designing a persuasively complete infrastructure for managing user rights, roles and rules is an essentially open-ended task. Second that building a simple, open-ended framework for the same domain can probably be completed with very little effort.</p></blockquote>



<p>Unfortunately, the Working Group does not adequately understand the issues involved. They will create a tool based on a limited understanding of the problem, attempt to drive it into a standard, and leave to others the social and administrative headaches it will cause.</p>



<blockquote><p>This general strategy applies to the rest of the Living Worlds effort as well. Our goal is to reach quick consensus on a minimal subset, and then to encourage the rapid creation of several reference implementations of that proposed feature set. Refinement of the concepts can then proceed in an atmosphere usefully disciplined by implementation experience.</p></blockquote>



<p>Problems of this kind cannot be solved by refinement.</p>



 Incomplete 



<p>If the Living Worlds Documentation were just the work in progress of a working group, then it is appropriate that they publish their materials on the net for comment by interested parties, and it would be absurd to point out that the work is unfinished. But because it is also being presented publicly as a networking standard, and because the Living Worlds Working Group has already begun the work of standard setting, the Documentation needs to be tested for its fitness as a standard.</p>



<p>If the Living Worlds Documentation is read as a proposed standard, then it should be rejected out-of-hand, simply because it is incomplete. In its present form, the Living Worlds Documentation is not even complete enough to criticize.</p>



 Principles 



<p>The Living Worlds Working Group selected a set of principles to guide the development process. Membership in the working group is open to anyone who can accept the principles. This is a reasonable way for a working group to define itself. Unfortunately, the principles of the Working Group are problematic for a standards body. While the Living World Documentation is not complete enough to criticize, the principles and basic architecture can be criticized.</p>



  Build on VRML 2.0.Use VRML 2.0&nbsp;would have been a better first principle. By&nbsp;Building on VRML 2.0, the Working Group is hoping to work some or all of the Livings Worlds work into the VRML 3.0 standard, thereby increasing the importance of the Living Worlds Standard.This component-oriented principle led the Working Group to put the display processor in the center of a distributed architecture, ignoring decades of experience in the separation of I/O from other computational goals.Fortunately, the recent moderating influence of the Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratory (MERL) has opened the Living Worlds Working Group to the possibility of other presentation models. Unfortunately, the Living Worlds Architecture is already fixed on a set of unwieldy interfaces which were motivated by a VRML-centric design space.  Standards, not designs.The second principle is intended to give implementers a large amount of leeway in realizing the standard. The amount of leeway is so great that it might not be possible for independent implementations to interoperate with implementations developed by the Working Group. Since that is specifically what a standard is supposed to accomplish, the second principle is self-defeating.The other benefit of the second principle to the Working Group is to provide an expedient method of dealing with disputes. When the members of the Working Group do not agree on an architectural point, they agree to disagree and leave the choice to the implementer. Sometimes the reason they do not agree is because they were confronting an essential, hard problem.  Architectural Agnosticism.The third principle concerns the question of centralized (server-based) or decentralized (distributed) architecture. Centralized social networking systems often suffer from performance problems because the server can become a bottleneck. The Working Group therefore wants to keep the option of decentralization open: A centralized architecture cannot be transformed into a decentralized architecture simply by being vague about the role of the server. Decentralized design requires the solution of a large number of hard problems, particularly problems of security. An insecure architecture can facilitate the victimization of avatar owners by miscreants. Insecurity will also limit the architecture to supporting only limited interactions, such as chat. Higher value services like cooperative work and interpersonal commerce require a secure platform. Such a platform is not a goal or result of the Living Worlds Initiative.Because the third principle does not explicitly call for the solution to the problems of secure decentralization, it is self-defeating, resulting in an implementations which are either insecure or devoutly centralist or both.  Respect the role of the market.In the fourth principle, the Working Group chooses this unfortunate non-goal: The process does not pay adequate attention to the consequences of the design. The goal of the Working Group is to establish a standard early, relying on iteration in the maintenance of the standard to make it, if not the best imaginable, then good enough for commercial use. The process is not forward-looking enough to provide confidence that the standard can be corrected later. Significant architectural features, such as security, are extremely difficult to insert compatibly into existing systems.  Require running code.The fifth principle appears to be the most respectable, but when coupled with the urgency and recklessness of the fourth principle, it becomes the most dangerous.A standards development process that requires demonstration of new techniques before incorporating them into the standard can be a very good thing because it provides assurance that the standard is implementable. It can also provide early evidence of the utility of the new techniques.But if such a process is driven by extreme time pressure, as the Living Worlds Working Group is, then the fifth principle has a terrible result: only ideas with quick and dirty implementations can be considered. The Working Group will finish its work before hard problems can be understood and real solutions can be produced.So, by principle, the Working Group is open, but not to good ideas that will require time and effort to realize.  



 Conclusion 



<p>The software industry sometimes observes that its problems are due to not having standards, or to having too many standards. Often, its problems are due to having standards that are not good enough.</p>



<p>Premature standardization in the area of virtual worlds will not assure success.</p>



<p>The Living Worlds Initiative is a model for cooperative research, and as such it should be encouraged. The Working Group is using the net to create a virtual community of software developers working together on a common project. This is very good.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the Living Worlds Initiative is also a standards-setting initiative, building on the momentum of the recent VRML 2.0 standard. It would be harmful to adopt the Living Worlds Initiative as a standard at this time.</p>

<p>I’ve long been enamored of the <a href="https://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001OR">sparkline</a>, a graphical device which its inventor Edward Tufte defines thusly:</p>
<blockquote><p>A sparkline is a small intense, simple, word-sized graphic with typographic resolution. Sparklines mean that graphics are no longer cartoonish special occasions with captions and boxes, but rather sparkline graphics can be everywhere a word or number can be: embedded in a sentence, table, headline, map, spreadsheet, graphic.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nowadays you can create sparklines in many tools including Excel and Google Sheets, both of which can use the technique to pack a summary of a series of numbers into a single cell. By stacking such cells vertically you can create views that compress vast amounts of information.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/07/21/a-virtuous-cycle-for-analytics/">A virtuous cycle for analytics</a> I noted that we often use Metabase to display tables and charts based on extracts from our Postgres warehouse. I really wanted to use sparklines to summarize views of activity over time, but that isn’t yet an option in Metabase.</p>
<p>When Metabase is connected to Postgres, though, you can write Metabase questions that can not only call built-in Postgres functions but can also call user-defined functions. Can such a function accept an array of numbers and return a sparkline for display in the Metabase table viewer? Yes, if you use Unicode characters to represent the variable-height bars of a sparkline.</p>
<p>There’s a page at rosettacode.org devoted to <a href="https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Sparkline_in_unicode">Unicode sparklines</a> based on this sequence of eight characters:</p>



U+2581
▁
LOWER ONE EIGHTH BLOCK


U+2582
▂
LOWER ONE QUARTER BLOCK


U+2583

LOWER THREE EIGHTHS BLOCK


U+2584

U+2585

LOWER FIVE EIGHTHS BLOCK


U+2586
▆
LOWER THREE QUARTERS BLOCK


U+2587
▇
LOWER SEVEN EIGHTHS BLOCK


U+2588
█
FULL BLOCK



<p>Notice that 2581, 2582, and 2588 are narrower than the rest. I’ll come back to that at the end.</p>
<p>If you combine them into a string of eight characters you get this result:</p>
<p>▁▂▃▄▅▆▇█</p>
<p>Notice that the fourth and eight characters in the sequence drop below the baseline. I’ll come back to that at the end too.</p>
<p>These characters can be used to define eight buckets into which numbers in a series can be quantized. Here are some examples from the rosettacode.org page:</p>
<p>“1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1” -&gt; ▁▂▃▄▅▆▇█▇▆▅▄▃▂▁<br>
“1.5, 0.5 3.5, 2.5 5.5, 4.5 7.5, 6.5” -&gt; ▂▁▄▃▆▅█▇<br>
“0, 1, 19, 20” -&gt; ▁▁██<br>
“0, 999, 4000, 4999, 7000, 7999” -&gt; ▁▁▅▅██</p>
<p>To write a Postgres function that would do this, I started with the Python example from rosettacode.org:</p>
 bar = '▁▂▃▄▅▆▇█'
barcount = len(bar)
 
def sparkline(numbers):
    mn, mx = min(numbers), max(numbers)
    extent = mx - mn
    sparkline = ''.join(bar[min([barcount - 1,
                                 int((n - mn) / extent * barcount)])]
                        for n in numbers)
    return mn, mx, sparkline
 
<p>While testing it I happened to try an unchanging sequence, [3, 3, 3, 3], which fails with a divide-by-zero error. In order to address that, and to unpack the algorithm a bit for readability, I arrived at this Postgres function:</p>
 create function sparkline(numbers bigint[]) returns text as $$

    def bar_index(num, _min, barcount, extent):
        index = min([barcount - 1, int( (num - _min) / extent * bar_count)])
        return index

    bars = '\u2581\u2582\u2583\u2584\u2585\u2586\u2587\u2588'
    _min, _max = min(numbers), max(numbers)
    extent = _max - _min 

    if extent == 0:  # avoid divide by zero if all numbers are equal
        extent = 1

    bar_count = len(bars)
    sparkline = ''
    for num in numbers:
        index = bar_index(num, _min, bar_count, extent)
        sparkline = sparkline + bars[index]

    return sparkline

$$ language plpython3u;
 
<p>Here’s a psql invocation of the function:</p>
 analytics=# select sparkline(array[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]);
    sparkline
-----------------
▁▂▃▄▅▆▇█▇▆▅▄▃▂▁
(1 row) 
<p>And here’s an example based on actual data:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Each row represents a university course in which students and teachers are annotating the course readings. Each bar represents a week’s worth of activity. Their heights are not comparable from row to row; some courses do a lot of annotating and some not so much; each sparkline reports relative variation from week to week; the sum and weekly max columns report absolute numbers.</p>
<p>This visualization makes it easy to see that annotation was occasional in some courses and continuous in others. And when you scroll, the temporal axis comes alive; try scrolling this view to see what I mean.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We use the same mechanism at three different scales. One set of sparklines reports daily activity for students in courses; another rolls those up to weekly activity for courses at a school; still another rolls all those up to weekly activity for each school in the system.</p>
<p>At the level of individual courses, the per-student sparkline views can show patterns of interaction. In the left example here, vertical bands of activity reflect students annotating for particular assignments. In the right example there may be a trace of such temporal alignment but activity is less synchronized and more continuous.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When we’re working in Metabase we can use its handy mini bar charts to contextualize the row-wise sums.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The sparkline-like mini bar chart shows a row’s sum relative to the max for the column. Here we can see that a course with 3,758 notes has about 1/4 the number of notes as the most note-heavy course at the school.</p>
<p>Because these Unicode sparklines are just strings of text in columns of SQL or HTML tables, they can participate in sort operations. In our case we can sort on all columns including ones not shown here: instructor name, course start date, number of students. But the default is to sort by the sparkline column which, because it encodes time, orders courses by the start of annotation activity.</p>
<p>The visual effect is admittedly crude, but it’s a good way to show certain kinds of variation. And it’s nicely portable. A Unicode sparkline looks the same in a psql console, an HTML table, or a tweet. The function will work in any database that can run it, using Python or another of the languages demoed at rosettacode.org. For example, I revisited the Workbench workflow described in <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/08/01/a-beautiful-power-tool-to-scrape-clean-and-combine-data/">A beautiful power tool to scrape, clean, and combine data</a> and added a tab for <a href="https://app.workbenchdata.com/workflows/149325/">Lake levels</a>.</p>
<p>When I did that, though, the effect was even cruder than what I’ve been seeing in my own work.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In our scenarios, with longer strings of characters, the differences average out and things align pretty well; the below-the-baseline effect has been annoying but not a deal breaker. But the width variation in this example does feel like a deal breaker.</p>
<p>What if we omit the problematic characters U+2581 (too narrow) and U+2584/U+2588 (below baseline and too narrow)?</p>
<p></p>
<p>There are only 5 buckets into which to quantize numbers, and their heights aren’t evenly distributed. But for the intended purpose — to show patterns of variation — I think it’s sufficient in this case. I tried swapping the 5-bucket method into the function that creates sparklines for our dashboards but I don’t think I’ll switch. The loss of vertical resolution makes our longer sparklines less useful, and the width variation is barely noticeable.</p>
<p>Unicode evolves, of course, so maybe there will someday be a sequence of characters that’s friendlier to sparklines. Maybe there already is? If so please let me know, I’d love to use it.</p>

    How many people do you need before identity has value - two! How come, as an industry where 3.2bn (<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/digital-identification-a-key-to-inclusive-growth">McKinsey</a>) people have a digital identity, are we so fragmented, uncoordinated and disagreeable?&nbsp; <p>It is evident that our ongoing discussions about identity, ethics, bias, privacy and consent revolve around a lot of noise (opinions) but little signal (alignment), but why?&nbsp; Recognising that in 30 years of digital identity, we still lack coherent and coordinated action to make it work for everyone is a reality. Perhaps it is time to recognise that it is “us”, the industry, who are the problem.&nbsp; We continue in our self confirming opinions, righteous products and determination to win at all costs.&nbsp; I am not saying we have not made progress or done amazing things, but we have not done as well as we should have!</p><p>As identity now takes several forms insomuch that it emerges from interactions with a system (say payment &amp; reputation), is foundational (given by an authority, a credential), and we can create our own (Self Soverign Identity [SSI]), we are more divided than ever on what we should build on, but have we got it totally wrong. This article gives some New thinking to rattle us.&nbsp;</p><p>We (anyone in identity, privacy, consent, digital space) are unlikely to like reading this. I am aware the responses are unlikely to be favourable, positive or constructive; because this is hard. The learning and takeaway, in the end, draws from a different market, who have solved how to act as one, even though they did not align.</p><p>-----&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I am first unpacking the current status.</p> What happens when the user (human) is not the connector? <p>We live in a digital age that is utterly dependent on the complex connectivity of systems, and in all but one case, the integrated communication path requires the centricity to be on a company, government body, product or service; except for personal identity, privacy and consent that remain focussed on an individual human.&nbsp;</p><p>Identity (all forms) is a function of context based on relationships. Identity exists between the two poles of emergent ID (from system and interactions), functional ID (a credential given to us by an authority) and with an individual (in the case of personal identity) being the connecting point. The dependencies between these solutions mean that our “identity data” rests in government, organisations, companies and individual domains.</p><p></p> Identity in this context <p>Identity includes everything that you can imagine: who you think you are, passport, ID, login, email, IP address, messages, census data, birth record, photos, friends, education, work, conversations, experience, travel, reputation, scars, memories, health, heart rate, blood pressure, medication, family tree, skin, DNA, parents, heritage, analysis, habits, rules, content, culture, who you identify as - everything yesterday, today and tomorrow that identify you as you and that makes you unique.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Functional or Foundational Identity <p>I am keeping it broad &amp; straightforward. Passport, birth certification, diving licence, DNA, sovereign ID, company ID and anything given to you by someone who has command and control (a credential.)&nbsp; Foundational Identity has governance and oversight about who issues the foundational identity, and therefore they are classed as an "authoritative source."&nbsp;</p><p>Foundational “hard” ID is given, but from it rises many softer identities (identifications) that are all built from having a foundation.&nbsp; If we had an unbreakable lineage and provenance to back identification from identity, it might help; but there are unintended consequences we have to face.&nbsp;</p> Pause and Reflection <p>We know something is broken in the functional ID model as my identity is me, who I am, what drives me, experience; it is not my passport but where the passport took me and the experiences I gained there.&nbsp; We know some don’t have the foundations of identification, but they have an identity.&nbsp; Your foundation identity does not define who you are.</p> Emergence&nbsp; <p>Definition: Emergence is where the properties or behaviours only emerge when components or parts interact as part of a whole inclusive system.&nbsp;</p> Emergence Identity <p>An identity that forms because you interact with systems.&nbsp; Your made-up email address enables someone to know where you live, what you buy, when you shop, who you shop for.&nbsp; Your preferences and actions identify you.&nbsp; This identity emerges not because you have a trusted bank account to pay but because you interact, your reputation.&nbsp; Your passport allows and enables interactions.&nbsp; The more we interact in a complex digital world, the more emergent identities we have.&nbsp;</p><p>Emergence is usually hidden insofar that IP address providers or payment transaction analysis systems could be judged as emergent identity creators. We as individuals do not control them or have visibility of the data (dark/ hidden). It is very much a debate if consent is needed and/ or if the creator (the user) should have this data under their control.&nbsp; Open Banking could be seen as one of the first emergent identity systems that do give the user some control.</p><p>If emergent identity had strong governance and oversight, it might also become like a Functional Identity.</p> We have to accept our identity is more than the sum. <p>The diagram below is based on a <a href="https://www.jpr.org.uk/documents/14-06-19.barry_johnson.polarity_management.pdf">polarity model</a>.&nbsp; Unlike a linear or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_chain">value chain mode</a>l, there is no one universal starting point or final destination.&nbsp; As we discover the value and limitations of the two principle identity models, we recognise that we continually move around the model, never settling at one place or outcome but learning and improving both.&nbsp; However, given the boundaries and limitations of each, we need both to be successful.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The purpose of functional and emergence ID is to determine where you start the journey.</p><br><p></p> There is a deep dependency.&nbsp; <p>Without foundational, I cannot access emergent; without emergent, I cannot gain value from foundational. If I cannot gain/ get a foundational identity, emergent identity enables me to start, barter/ trade and protect myself.&nbsp; Emergence can be a lifeline to getting a foundational identity.&nbsp;</p><p>Companies, organisations and governments believe that control of your identity is critically important. They call it identity to ensure you are not aware if it is emergent or foundational.&nbsp; They (well, we the industry) will use one to create the other and cause confusion.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Where does SSI (self-sovereign identity) fit? <p>Ignoring the name and all those issues, SSI is not emergent ID or functional/ foundational ID, but our agent for identity. SSI is a decentralized model for digital identity based on an entity’s control over forming and using cryptographically secured digital connections (using DIDs) and accepting and presenting digitally signed credentials (VCs). It applies as much to organizations and IoT as individuals. (thanks @DrummondReed)<br></p><p>SSI has made me realise that we have created different onboarding positions and propositions, not different approaches to identity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>SSI could be seen as a new model for providing functional ID that has interesting possibilities for helping with some aspects of emergent ID. But no technology can fully emulate the qualities of emergent ID.</p> But what does this mean? <p>There is a deep desire to want the best of all worlds without realising or recognising the separation and interdependence. We debate and argue about transparency, data sharing, ontology requirements, privacy by design, consent driven, control, value, power, and much more in wanting the best.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Given we cannot have a form of identity without the other, how can we cycle faster to co-create better solutions with the best aspects of both? But recognise that consent works well for foundational identity but is hopeless for emergent. Privacy can protect foundational ID, but not emergent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> The linkage is us, the human, today, but should we be the link? <p>Right now, it is the individual who connects the different domains of personal identity.&nbsp; Without you and your needs to trade, barter, work, play - these domains would not need connecting.&nbsp; We create and need connections and are the connector.&nbsp; We may be lucky enough to have a foundational ID at birth, but for a digital life, we need both.&nbsp; We are the connection until death when they will slowly separate again as emergent ID is no longer needed, but a link can continue.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Mapping some solutions <p>Below is the polarity map of identity with SSI, SOLID, yoti, and Vouch added. Why have I only picked these from the 100+ solutions, because I want others to place where they are.&nbsp; The placements are the starting positions for onboarding, the value proposition to get onto the identify loop.&nbsp; It is not where they stay or add the most value; it is day zero, what problem is solved and why you should join. I am likely to have in-correctly positioned them, so if you feel they are wrong, please identify a better place.&nbsp; The message is that we all start as different places to solve the same problem.&nbsp; But what we do is continually confuse everyone and ensure that we disagree on what identity means or what it is for.&nbsp; We hold fast to our “best in class” solution, our product and our personal beliefs with conformational bias.&nbsp;</p><p></p> Who has solved the same problem before? <p>An insight for us (the identity industry) comes from an unlikely source. Time to look at the green movement, global warming and climate change.&nbsp; Back in the 1960s, when protests against nuclear power and arms were in full swing, we also marched for: save the whales, save the endangered species, save the newt, save the planet, save humanity, save the tigers, save the elephants, save the orangutans and many more. &nbsp; On a march or protest, there were a few to hundred and the occasional thousand.&nbsp; Co-ordinated marches across the globe in different cities swelled the number on a specific topic march.&nbsp; During the 80’s “Feed the World” raised millions of pounds for a cause, famine in Africa.&nbsp; When acting as one - we can start to create change.</p><p>At some point, something interesting happened.&nbsp; Individuals connected their ecosystem crisis to another, more significant, crisis.&nbsp; It was bigger than a connection; it was a cause.&nbsp; The small marches against an effect could start to see there was a more significant cause.&nbsp; Global warming and climate change bought together those focusing on local protests through loss of habitat to match together as one voice as their loss resulted from a cause. Save the Whales would not join a save the newt but can walk side by side on Climate Change.&nbsp; Climate change was not a march but a “co-opted” group from thousands of different factions fighting for their own passion, purpose or love.&nbsp; Many voices became one and retained their own passion.&nbsp;</p><p>Identity has many factions, many voices, many causes, many definitions and many solutions.&nbsp; We continue to define, redefine and demand our “xxx” of identity as the one usually because it is the model we want as we will benefit.&nbsp;</p><p>Our big and unifying issue is to recognise that corporates, especially big tech and government, have no interest in one identity and indeed would find ways to ensure it remains factions and uncoordinated unless they are the single controller. They will sponsor and support many programs, many solutions and keep the divisions going, playing a game. Single identity would likely also render Facebook and media companies, with their advertising model unworkable - so not all big tech want a solution! Division works.</p><p>Perhaps the lesson here is that we should stop fighting for our own version of identity (privacy, ethics, consent), for our own definitions, for our own implementations, for our own solutions, for our own products and start to think about acting like one. Each of us swallows some pride, eats some ego and finds ways to behave as one industry voice, one team who cares together as we have passion, purpose and heart to solve identity problems for everyone.</p><p>The railway, automobile and aero industries across the world have made it work. Building different gauge infrastructures to different standards but eventually learning that together they thrive when they stopped wanting aligned infrastructures and found a way to ensure users could access and use it all.&nbsp;</p><p>If you disagree, share this and say why. If you agree, share this, so we talk about it at our meeting places.&nbsp; If you're an influencer, reflect to see if we are the problem. If you organise events, why not make time to lead this debate?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p>----</p><p>This article has been in formation for some 18 months. It had no direction or lacked sense at points, and through perseverance, friends, and discussion, it has become what it is today.&nbsp; Many have shaped the thinking.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

  <p>Summary:      Smart property is much more than the anemic connected things we have now. Smart property imagines a world where every thing participates in digital communities and ecosystems, working through programmable agents under the owners control.</p>



<p>
    I just listened to this <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/the-future-of-stuff-podcast-ep-1-what-is-smart-property-with-vinay-gupta-b1b42793e57">excellent podcast by Vinay Gupta</a> about what he calls "smart property." Vinay released a book last year call The Future of Stuff that covers this topic in more detail. 
</p>

<blockquote> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B08B4F5QK3/windleyofente-20">The Future of Stuff by Vinay Gupta</a> <p>Where and who do we want to be? How might we get there? What might happen if we stay on our current course? The Future of Stuff asks what kind of world will we live in when every item of property has a digital trace, when nothing can be lost and everything has a story. Will property and ownership become as fluid as film is today: summoned on demand, dismissed with a swipe? What will this mean for how we buy, rent, share and dispose of stuff? About what our stuff says about us? And how will this impact on us, on manufacturing and supply, and on the planet?
</p><p></p></blockquote>

<p>
    The idea is similar to what <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/shaping-things">Bruce Sterling has called Spimes</a> and what we've been <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/12/the_self-sovereign_internet_of_things.shtml">building on top of picos for over a decade</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Smart property goes well beyond the internet of things and connected devices to imagine a world where every thing is not just online, but has a digital history and can interact with other smart things to accomplish whatever goals their owners desire. Things are members of <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2015/07/social_things_trustworthy_spaces_and_the_internet_of_things.shtml">communities</a> and <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2014/06/fuse_as_a_model_of_the_vehicle_ecosystem.shtml">ecosystems</a>, working through programmable agents.
</p>

<p>
    A world of smart things is decentralized–it has to be. While Vinay talks of blockchains and smart contracts, <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/07/ten_reasons_to_use_picos_for_your_next_decentralized_programming_project.shtml">I work on picos</a>. Likely both, or some version of them, are necessary to achieve the end goal of a sustainable internet of things to replace the anemic, unsustainable <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/07/alternatives_to_the_compuserve_of_things.shtml">CompuServe of Things</a> we're being offered now.
</p>

<a></a>
 Going Further 

<p>
    We've built a platform on top of picos for managing things called <a href="https://manifold.picolabs.io/">Manifold</a>. This is a successor to <a href="https://www.windley.com/tags/squaretag.shtml">SquareTag</a>, if you've been following along. You can use Manifold to create spimes or digital twins for your things. Some of the built-in applications allow you to find lost stuff using QR code stickers or write notes about your things using a journaling app. You could <a href="https://github.com/Picolab/Manifold">build others since the application is meant to be programmable and extendable</a>. I primarily use it as a personal inventory system.

Epistemology doesn’t just ask questions about what we should do to find things out; that is the task of all disciplines to some extent. For example, science, research, data analysis, and anthropology all have their own methods for finding things out. Epistemology has the job of making those methods themselves the objects of study. It aims to understand how methods of inquiry can be seen as rational endeavours.</p><p>If the concept of “knowing things to be true” were simple, we’d all agree on many things that we currently disagree about; climate and vaccines appear current.&nbsp; We cannot reach a unanimous agreement means something is wrong with our data, analysis, and information model.</p><p>The senior leadership team will tend to think of themselves as clear thinkers and see those who disagree with an opinion as misguided. Executives believe they have the capacity to see things just as they “really” are and that it is others who have confused perceptions. As a result, the CDO can simply point out to everyone where their thinking has gone wrong using facts rather than engage in rational dialogue allowing for the possibility that we all might be wrong. Philosophy, psychology and cognitive science guide us that we are complex, and our reasoning is not clinical or pure. Data (facts) and its analysis create a staggeringly complex array of cognitive biases and dispositions. We are generally ignorant of their role in others who influence us and our own thinking and decision-making.</p><p>A CDO is responsible for introducing everyone who touches data to a systematic way of interrogating thinking, models, rationality, and a sense of what makes “for a good reason” for both sides of the evidence coin.&nbsp;</p><p>As a CDO, you should help determine by what criteria the leadership team are to evaluate reason.&nbsp; We need to establish how, as a team, the criteria themselves are evaluated? Further, how do we determine how a belief or action can be justified and the relationship between justification and truth? &nbsp; And as the CDO, we have to establish and own the <a href="https://opengovernance.net/data-for-better-decisions-nature-or-nurture-79e6531dbe3a">company-wide top-level data ontology</a>.&nbsp;</p><p></p><br><p>The first action will be to get the topic of evidence on the agenda, not as a diversion, but to start to bring up critical issues such as bias in our decision making.&nbsp;</p><br><br><p>----</p><p>Whilst our ongoing agile iteration into <a href="https://opengovernance.net/what-occurs-when-physical-beings-transition-to-information-beings-146ea9dcbca3">information beings</a> is never-ending, there are the first 100 days in the new role. But what to focus on? Well, that rose-tinted period of conflicting priorities is what <a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo/">&lt;/Hello, CDO!&gt;</a> is all about. Maintaining sanity when all else has been lost to untested data assumptions is a different problem entirely.</p> <br>

<p>On Quora, here’s <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-worst-design-trends-in-modern-cars/answer/Doc-Searls">my answer</a> to <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-worst-design-trends-in-modern-cars">What are the worst design trends in modern cars?</a>—updated by our family’s experience with a new Toyota that features even more indicators than the bunch above::::</p>
<p>Based on driving&nbsp;lots&nbsp;of late-model rental cars, here’s a list:</p>
 
 Entertainment systems that are hard to use and dangerous on the road. (Few are good. Most are bad. Some are truly awful.) 
 Making AM and FM listening harder than ever. Some of this is by putting too many functions in too many menus you have to poke at. (While driving, knobs and switches beat buttons for usability. Ask a pilot.) Some of it is by burying antennas in windows, which will never work as well as a whip antenna (preferably the retractable kind that can survive a car wash). But a thumbs-up to cars offering HD Radio, which adds many more stations to FM and far better sound to AM (on the sadly too few stations that feature it). 
 Way too much optionality among features with non-obvious meanings that you control through buttons with whaaa? symbols or half-buried menus that can be as dangerous to navigate while driving as it is to finger-text on one’s cell phone. For example, a loaded 2021 Toyota Camry Hybrid has TSS w/PD, HUD, DRCC, LDA w/SA, LTA, AHB, PCS, RCD, RSA, BSM. RCTA, RCTB, VSC, EV, ECO, plus other stuff that’s a bit more spelled out, such as TRAC, Qi Wireless Charger and Birds Eye View Camera. And those are in addition to the usual indicators: shifter position, odometer, outside temperature, etc. Many of these unclear functions are displayed only or mainly in the “Meters/Multi-Information Display” you view through or over your steering wheel. Since there is no way the display can give you a full view of all these functions in all their possible states, you move around your selections and menus through buttons on the steering wheel that you mash with your left thumb. And that’s just one model of one car. (Which we happen to almost have: ours is a 2020 model.) 
 Poor visibility out the back corners, thanks to extra-wide roof pillars and fake-muscle styling that narrows the shapes of the cars’ aft windows. 
 No place to mount a phone. I mean, why have Apple’s CarPlay and/or Android Auto and&nbsp;not&nbsp;have a place to mount a phone? (Yes, there are aftermarket things with suction cups, but most new cars lack a surface other than the windshield that will hold a cup sucked.) 
 Trunks with plenty of space but too small an opening, so it’s hard to get large or odd-shaped items in there. 
 Low-profile and performance tires, which handle nicely but can ride rough and transmit lots of road noise. 
 Too much black. On the dashboard platform under windshields, black makes sense because you don’t want a light color reflecting off the windshield. But black is used way too much in trim. Worse, black steering wheels parked in the sun can get too hot to hold. And black leather or vinyl seats can fry your ass. 
 Giant grills—especially ones that resemble <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=mouth+of+manta+ray">the mouths of manta rays</a>. (I’m <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=lexus+grille+manta+ray">looking at you</a>, Lexus.) 
 The tendency of headlight lenses to develop cataracts. My ’05 Subaru has them. My daughter’s newer Honda Civic has worse ones. Could be newer models don’t do that, but it’s actually dangerous and needs to be gone. 
 
<p>Comments still don’t work here, so instead tweet about it or write me directly: first name at last name dot com.</p>

<p>Some news: I’m super happy to report that I started a new job last week at <a href="https://nytimes.com/">The
New York Times</a>.</p>
<p>After ten years at <a href="https://iovation.com/">iovation</a>, the last four working remotely from New York City
and the last three under the ownership of <a href="https://transunion.com/">TransUnion</a>, I felt it was time to
find something new. At The Times, I’ve taken the role of Staff Engineer on a new
team, User Systems. I’m particularly stoked for this gig, as it falls right into
areas of abiding interest, including privacy-by design, personal data
protection, encryption, authentication, credential management, and scaling a
vital app for the whole business. Add that to the straightforward commute once
the office reopens, and it’s hard to find something more ideal.</p>
<p>I truly appreciate the extraordinary experience of my ten years at iovation. I
originally thought I’d stay a couple years, but was so engaged by the people and
the great work we did that I kept at it. I learned a ton about product
engineering, product design, and scalable architectures, but especially about
working with terrific colleagues who made me a better person even as I tried to
be of service to them. I will especially miss working with Scott, Kurk, Clara,
Travis, John, and Eric — and countless others. I wish them all the best, and
would enjoy working with any and all of them again anytime.</p>
<p>Now I’m excited to make new connections working with my amazing new colleagues
at The Times. I expect we’ll collaborate on fulfilling work building super
useful tools that advance <a href="https://www.nytco.com/company/mission-and-values/" title="The New York Times Company: Mission and Values">The Times mission</a> to inform and empower its readers.
I’m delighted to be jumping on this ride with them.</p>

<p>Sometimes Angular applications are required to authenticate against multiple identity providers. This blog post shows how to implement an Angular SPA which authenticates using <a href="https://auth0.com/">Auth0</a> for one identity provider and also IdentityServer4 from <a href="https://duendesoftware.com/">Duende</a> software as the second. The SPA can logout from both of the identity providers individually and also revoke the refresh token used to renew the session using the revocation endpoint. The endsession endpoint is used to logout. IdentityServer4 also supports introspection so that it is possible to revoke reference tokens on a logout as well as the refresh token. The Angular application uses OpenID Connect code flow with PKCE implemented using the npm <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/angular-auth-oidc-client">angular-auth-oidc-client</a> library.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/angular-auth-oidc-client/tree/main/projects/sample-code-flow-multi-Auth0-ID4">https://github.com/damienbod/angular-auth-oidc-client/tree/main/projects/sample-code-flow-multi-Auth0-ID4</a></p>



<p>The  <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/angular-auth-oidc-client">angular-auth-oidc-client</a> npm package can be added to the application in the App.Module class. We used an AuthConfigModule module to configure the settings and can keep the AppModule small.</p>


  import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { RouterModule } from '@angular/router';
import { AppComponent } from './app.component';
import { AuthConfigModule } from './auth-config.module';
import { HomeComponent } from './home/home.component';
import { UnauthorizedComponent } from './unauthorized/unauthorized.component';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent, HomeComponent, UnauthorizedComponent],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    RouterModule.forRoot([
      { path: '', redirectTo: 'home', pathMatch: 'full' },
      { path: 'home', component: HomeComponent },
      { path: 'forbidden', component: UnauthorizedComponent },
      { path: 'unauthorized', component: UnauthorizedComponent },
    ]),
    AuthConfigModule,
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent],
})
export class AppModule {}

  


<p>The  AuthConfigModule  configures the two identity providers. Both clients are setup to use the Open ID Connect code flow with PKCE (proof key for code exchange). Each secure token server (STS) has it’s specifics configurations which are required to use this flow. These configurations must match the corresponding client configuration on the token service of the identity provider. All identity providers have their own flavour of the Open ID Connect specification and also support different features.  Some of these are worse, some are better. When implementing SPA applications, you should validate the required features supported by the identity provider.</p>


  import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { AuthModule, LogLevel } from 'angular-auth-oidc-client';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    AuthModule.forRoot({
      config: [
        {
          authority: 'https://offeringsolutions-sts.azurewebsites.net',
          redirectUrl: window.location.origin,
          postLogoutRedirectUri: window.location.origin,
          clientId: 'angularCodeRefreshTokens',
          scope: 'openid profile email taler_api offline_access',
          responseType: 'code',
          silentRenew: true,
          useRefreshToken: true,
          logLevel: LogLevel.Debug,
        },
        {
          authority: 'https://dev-damienbod.eu.auth0.com',
          redirectUrl: window.location.origin,
          postLogoutRedirectUri: window.location.origin,
          clientId: 'Ujh5oSBAFr1BuilgkZPcMWEgnuREgrwU',
          scope: 'openid profile offline_access auth0-user-api-spa',
          responseType: 'code',
          silentRenew: true,
          useRefreshToken: true,
          logLevel: LogLevel.Debug,
          customParamsAuthRequest: {
            audience: 'https://auth0-api-spa',
          },
          customParamsRefreshTokenRequest: {
            scope: 'openid profile offline_access auth0-user-api-spa',
          },
        },
      ],
    }),
  ],
  exports: [AuthModule],
})
export class AuthConfigModule {}
  


<p>The checkAuthMultiple function is used to initialize the authentication state and begin the flows or whatever. An SPA application requires some route when this logic can run before the guards execute. This is not a server rendered application where the security runs in the trusted backend. The initializing logic setups the state and handles callbacks form the different authentication flows. Great care should be taken when using guards. If a guard is applied to the default route, you need to ensure that the initialization logic runs first. The checkAuthMultiple  function should only be called once in the application.</p>


  import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { OidcSecurityService } from 'angular-auth-oidc-client';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: 'app.component.html',
})
export class AppComponent implements OnInit {
  constructor(public oidcSecurityService: OidcSecurityService) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    this.oidcSecurityService.checkAuthMultiple().subscribe(([{ isAuthenticated, userData, accessToken }]) =&gt; {
      console.log('Authenticated', isAuthenticated);
    });
  }
}
  


<p>The sign-in logout, revoke tokens can then be implemented anywhere for the different identity providers. Each client configuration has its own configuration ID which can be used to run or start the required authentication flow, logout or whatever.</p>


  import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import {
  AuthenticatedResult,
  OidcClientNotification,
  OidcSecurityService,
  OpenIdConfiguration,
  UserDataResult,
} from 'angular-auth-oidc-client';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-home',
  templateUrl: 'home.component.html',
})
export class HomeComponent implements OnInit {
  configurations: OpenIdConfiguration[];
  userDataChanged$: Observable&lt;OidcClientNotification&lt;any&gt;&gt;;
  userData$: Observable&lt;UserDataResult&gt;;
  isAuthenticated$: Observable&lt;AuthenticatedResult&gt;;

  constructor(public oidcSecurityService: OidcSecurityService) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    this.configurations = this.oidcSecurityService.getConfigurations();
    this.userData$ = this.oidcSecurityService.userData$;
    this.isAuthenticated$ = this.oidcSecurityService.isAuthenticated$;
  }

  login(configId: string) {
    this.oidcSecurityService.authorize(configId);
  }

  forceRefreshSession() {
    this.oidcSecurityService.forceRefreshSession().subscribe((result) =&gt; console.warn(result));
  }

  logout(configId: string) {
    this.oidcSecurityService.logoff(configId);
  }

  refreshSessionId4(configId: string) {
    this.oidcSecurityService.forceRefreshSession(null, configId).subscribe((result) =&gt; console.log(result));
  }

  refreshSessionAuth0(configId: string) {
    this.oidcSecurityService
      .forceRefreshSession({ scope: 'openid profile offline_access auth0-user-api-spa' }, configId)
      .subscribe((result) =&gt; console.log(result));
  }

  logoffAndRevokeTokens(configId: string) {
    this.oidcSecurityService.logoffAndRevokeTokens(configId).subscribe((result) =&gt; console.log(result));
  }

  revokeRefreshToken(configId: string) {
    this.oidcSecurityService.revokeRefreshToken(null, configId).subscribe((result) =&gt; console.log(result));
  }
}

<p>Labels like “data scientist” and “data journalist” connote an elite corps of professionals who can analyze data and use it to reason about the world. There are elite practitioners, of course, but since the advent of online data a quarter century ago I’ve hoped that every thinking citizen of the world (and of the web) could engage in similar analysis and reasoning. </p>
<p>That’s long been possible for those of us with the ability to wrangle APIs and transform data using SQL, Python, or another programming language. But even for us it hasn’t been easy. When I read news stories that relate to the generation of electric power in California, for example, questions occur to me that I know I could illuminate by finding, transforming, and charting sources of web data:</p>
<p>– How can I visualize the impact of shutting down California’s last nuclear plant?</p>
<p>– What’s the relationship between drought and hydro power?</p>
<p>All the ingredients are lying around in plain sight, but the effort required to combine them winds up being more trouble than it’s worth. And that’s for me, a skilled longtime scraper and transformer of web data. For you — even if you’re a scientist or a journalist! — that may not even be an option.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://workbenchdata.com/">Workbench</a>, a web app with the tagline: “Scrape, clean, combine and analyze data without code.” I’ve worked with tools in the past that pointed the way toward that vision. DabbleDB in 2005 (now gone) and Freebase Gridworks in 2010 (still alive as Open Refine) were effective ways to cut through <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2008/02/20/overcoming-data-friction/">data friction</a>. Workbench carries those ideas forward delightfully. It enables me to fly through the boring and difficult stuff — the scraping, cleaning, and combining — in order to focus on what matters: the analysis.</p>
<p>Here’s the <a href="https://app.workbenchdata.com/workflows/149325/report">report</a> that I made to address the questions I posed above. It’s based on a <a href="https://app.workbenchdata.com/workflows/149325/">workflow</a> that you can visit and explore as I describe it here. (If you create your own account you can clone and modify.)</p>
<p>The workflow contains a set of tabs; each tab contains a sequence of steps; each step transforms a data set and displays output as a table or chart. When you load the page the first tab runs, and the result of its last step is displayed. In this case that’s the first chart shown in the report:</p>
<p></p>
<p>As in a Jupyter notebook you can run each step individually. Try clicking step 1. You’ll see a table of data from <a href="https://www.energy.ca.gov/data-reports/energy-almanac/california-electricity-data/electric-generation-capacity-and-energy">energy.ca.gov</a>. Notice that step 1 is labeled Concatenate tabs. If you unfurl it you’ll see that it uses another tab, 2001-2020 scraped, which in turn concatenates two other tabs, 2001-2010 scraped and 2011-2020 scraped. Note that I’ve helpfully explained that in the optional comment field above step 1.</p>
<p>Each of the two source tabs scrapes a table from the page at energy.ca.gov. As I note in the report, it wasn’t necessary to scrape those tables since the data are available as an Excel file that can be downloaded, then uploaded to Workbench (as I’ve done in the tab named energy.ca.gov xslx). I scraped them anyway because that web page presents a common challenge: the data appear in two separate HTML tables. That’s helpful to the reader but frustrating to an analyst who wants to use the data. Rapid and fluid combination of scraped tables is grease for cutting through data friction; Workbench supplies that grease.</p>
<p>Now click step 2 in the first tab. It’s the last step, so you’re back to the opening display of the chart. Unfurl it and you’ll see the subset of columns included in the chart. I’ve removed some minor sources, like oil and waste heat, in order to focus on major ones. Several details are notable here. First: colors. The system provides a default palette but you can adjust it. Black wasn’t on the default palette but I chose that for coal.</p>
<p>Second, grand total. The data set doesn’t include that column, and it’s not something I needed here. But in some situations I’d want it, so the system offers it as a choice. That’s an example of the attention to detail that pervades every aspect of Workbench. </p>
<p>Third, Vega. See the triple-dot button above the legend in the chart? Click it, then select Open in Vega Editor, and when you get there, click Run. Today I learned that Vega is:</p>
<blockquote><p>
a declarative format for creating, saving, and sharing visualization designs. With Vega, visualizations are described in JSON, and generate interactive views using either HTML5 Canvas or SVG.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Sweet! I think I’ll use it in my own work to simplify what I’ve recently (and painfully) learned how to do with D3.js. It’s also a nice example of how Workbench prioritizes openness, reusability, and reproducibility in every imaginable way.</p>
<p>I use the chart as the intro to my report, which is made with an elegant block editor in which you can combine tables and charts from any of your tabs with snippets of text written in markdown. There I begin to ask myself questions, adding tabs to marshal supporting evidence and sourcing evidence from tabs into the report.</p>
<p>My first question is about the contribution that the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant has been making to the overall mix. In the 2020 percentages all major sources tab I start in step 1 by reusing the tab 2001-2020 scraped. Step 2 filters the columns to just the same set of major sources shown in the chart. I could instead apply that step in 2001-2020 scraped and avoid the need to select columns for the chart. Since I’m not sure how that decision might affect downstream analysis I keep all the columns. If I change my mind it’s easy to push the column selection upstream. </p>
<p>Workbench not only makes it possible to refactor a workflow, it practically begs you to do that. When things go awry, as they inevitably will, it’s no problem. You can undo and redo the steps in each tab! You won’t see that in the read-only view but if you create your own account, and duplicate my workflow in it, give it a try. With stepwise undo/redo, exploratory analysis becomes a safe and stress-free activity.</p>
<p>At step 2 of 2020 percentages all major sources we have rows for all the years. In thinking about Diablo Canyon’s contribution I want to focus on a single reference year so in step 3 I apply a filter that selects just the 2020 row. Here’s the UX for that.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In situations like this, where you need to select one or more items from a list, Workbench does all the right things to minimize tedium: search if needed, start from all or none depending on which will be easier, then keep or remove selected items, again depending on which will be easier. </p>
<p>In step 4 I include an alternate way to select just the 2020 row. It’s a Select SQL step that says select * from input where Year = '2020'. That doesn’t change anything here; I could omit either step 3 or step 4 without affecting the outcome; I include step 4 just to show that SQL is available at any point to transform the output of a prior step. </p>
<p>Which is fantastic, but wait, there’s more. In step 5 I use a Python step to do the same thing in terms of a pandas dataframe. Again this doesn’t affect the outcome, I’m just showing that Python is available at any point to transform the output of a prior step. Providing equivalent methods for novices and experts, in a common interface, is extraordinarily powerful.</p>
<p>I’m noticing now, by the way, that step 5 doesn’t work if you’re not logged in. So I’ll show it to you here:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Step 6 transposes the table so we can reason about the fuel types. In steps 3-5 they’re columns, in step 6 they become rows. This is a commonly-needed maneuver. And while I might use the SQL in step 4 to do the row selection handled by the widget in step 3, I won’t easily accomplish the transposition that way. The Transpose step is one of the most powerful tools in the kit.</p>
<p>Notice at step 6 that the first column is named Year. That’s a common outcome of transposition and here necessitates step 7 in which I rename it to Fuel Type. There are two ways to do that. You can click the + Add Step button, choose the Rename columns option, drag the new step into position 7, open it, and do the renaming there. </p>
<p>But look:</p>
<p></p>
<p>You can edit anything in a displayed table. When I change Year to Fuel Type that way, the same step 7 that you can create manually appears automatically. </p>
<p></p>
<p>It’s absolutely brilliant.</p>
<p>In step 8 I use the Calculate step to add a new column showing each row’s percentage of the column sum. In SQL I’d have to think about that a bit. Here, as is true for so many routine operations like this, Workbench offers the solution directly: </p>
<p></p>
<p>Finally in step 9 I sort the table. The report includes it, and there I consider the question of Diablo Canyon’s contribution. According to my analysis nuclear power was 9% of the major sources I’ve selected, contributing 16,280 GWh in 2020. According to another energy.ca.gov page that I <a href="https://www.energy.ca.gov/sites/default/files/2020-03/Nuclear_Power_Reactors_in_California_ada.pdf">cite</a> in the report, Diablo Canyon is the only remaining nuke plant in the state, producing “about 18,000 GWh.” That’s not an exact match but it’s close enough to give me confidence that reasoning about the nuclear row in the table applies to Diablo Canyon specifically. </p>
<p>Next I want to compare nuclear power to just the subset of sources that are renewable. That happens in the 2020 percentages renewable tab, the output of which is also included in the report. Step 1 begins with the output of 2020 percentages of all major sources. In step 2 I clarify that the 2020 column is really 2020 GWh. In step 3 I remove the percent column in order to recalculate it. In step 4 I remove rows in order to focus on just nuclear and renewables. In step 5 I recalculate the percentages. And in step 6 I make the chart that also flows through to the report.</p>
<p>Now, as I look at the chart, I notice that the line for large hydro is highly variable and appears to correlate with drought years. In order to explore that correlation I look for data on reservoir levels and arrive at <a href="https://cdec.water.ca.gov/">https://cdec.water.ca.gov/</a>. I’d love to find a table that aggregates levels for all reservoirs statewide since 2001, but that doesn’t seem to be on offer. So I decide to use Lake Mendocino as a proxy. In step 1 I scrape an <a href="https://cdec.water.ca.gov/dynamicapp/QueryWY?Stations=MNC&amp;SensorNums=15&amp;End=2021-07-31&amp;span=20">HTML table</a> with monthly levels for the lake since 2001. In step 2 I delete the first row which only has some months. In step 3 I rename the first column to Year in order to match what’s  in the table I want to join with. In step 4 I convert the types of the month columns from text to numeric to enable calculation. In step 5 I calculate the average into a new column, Avg. In step 6 I select just Year and Avg. </p>
<p>When I first try the join in step 8 it fails for a common reason that Workbench helpfully explains:</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the other table Year looks like ‘2001’, but the text scraped from energy.ca.gov looks like ‘2,001’. That’s a common glitch that can bring an exercise like this to a screeching halt. There’s probably a Workbench way to do this, but in step 7 I use SQL to reformat the values in the Year column, removing the commas  to enable the join. While there I also rename the Avg column to Lake Mendocino Avg Level. Now in tab 8 I can do the join.</p>
<p>In tab 9 I scale the values for Large Hydro into a new column, Scaled Large Hydro. Why? The chart I want to see will compare power generation in GWh (gigawatt hours) and lake levels in AF (acre-feet). These aren’t remotely compatible but I don’t care, I’m just looking for comparable trends. Doubling the value for Large Hydro gets close enough for the comparison chart in step 10, which also flows through to the report.</p>
<p>All this adds up to an astonishingly broad, deep, and rich set of features. And I haven’t even talked about the <a href="http://help.workbenchdata.com/en/articles/2322465-clean-text">Clean text</a> step for tweaking whitespace, capitalization, and punctuation, or the <a href="http://help.workbenchdata.com/en/articles/1867388-refine">Refine</a> step for finding and merging clusters of similar values that refer to the same things. Workbench is also simply beautiful as you can see from the screen shots here, or by visiting my workflow. When I reviewed software products for BYTE and InfoWorld it was rare to encounter one that impressed me so thoroughly.</p>
<p>But wait, there’s more. </p>
<p>At the core of my workflow there’s a set of tabs; each is a sequence of steps; some of these produce tables and charts. Wrapped around the workflow there’s the report into which I cherrypick tables and charts for the story I’m telling there. </p>
<p>There’s also another kind of wrapper: a lesson wrapped around the workflow. I could write a lesson that guides you through the steps I’ve described and checks that each yields the expected result. See <a href="https://app.workbenchdata.com/courses/en/intro-to-data-journalism/first-story">Intro to data journalism</a> for an example you can try. Again, it’s brilliantly well done.</p>
<p>So Workbench succeeds in three major ways. If you’re not a data-oriented professional, but you’re a thinking person who wants to use available web data to reason about the world, Workbench will help you power through the grunt work of scraping, cleaning, and combining that data so you can focus on analysis. If you aspire to become such a professional, and you don’t have a clue about how to do that grunt work, it will help you learn the ropes. And if you are one of the pros you’ll still find it incredibly useful.</p>
<p>Kudos to the Workbench team, and especially to core developers Jonathan Stray, Pierre Conti, and Adam Hooper, for making this spectacularly great software tool. </p>

 Reflecting on change and community in a time of personal transition. Staring out over a world of possibilities (Joshua Tree, July&nbsp;2021)<p>Navigating through this global pandemic has leveled up both my tolerance for ambiguity and my appreciation for community — including friends, family, co-workers, and global colleagues. These dual forces of change and connection are also guiding me forward as I embark on a new professional chapter.</p><p>After three deeply rewarding and challenging years with <a href="http://transmute.industries">Transmute</a>, I’m transitioning into a new role this&nbsp;fall.</p><p>I will continue to work in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2021/CRD-did-core-20210724/">decentralized identity</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">verifiable credentials</a> ecosystem but will return to more of my impact roots as Senior Director of Product with Kiva’s <a href="https://www.kiva.org/protocol">Protocol</a> team — part of an <a href="http://kiva.org">international non-profit</a> working on digital identity as an enabler of deeper financial inclusion. I will also remain a champion and alumni advisor of Transmute, cheering the team on through next iterations of company and product development.</p><p>Making any big transition like this always surfaces the forest through the trees for me, bringing some longer term trends into focus in a way I often miss when heads down on day to day&nbsp;work.</p><p>In particular I’ve found myself reflecting on the philosophy and practice of open versus closed networks, and my growing conviction that open networks are a key to satisfaction and success, both for individuals and for businesses.</p><p>My working definition of “open networks” boils down to a mindset and style of engagement that assumes generosity, collaboration, and expanded connections will lead to mutual benefit. This can look like contributing to global standards and open source work, being proactive with connecting people, offering support without expectation of returned favors, and celebrating colleagues as they transition organizations (something I’ve been fortunate to experience this month with Transmute).</p><p>Open network interactions are empathetic and relational rather than transactional, rooted in a belief that we can progress and grow together, creating more opportunity in the process rather than competing for something finite.</p><p>By contrast, a more closed network approach (all too often the default) sees the gain of others as a personal loss if not compensated in some way. It is a more protective mentality that discourages transparency and informal exchange. It looks like vendor lock-in, punitive non-compete agreements, and proprietary code. To be clear, some degree of this is necessary for businesses to function today — to show value for investors, protect IP, drive competitive advantage, etc. However, taken as a default state, closed networks can crush both innovation and the spirits of individuals whose interests expand beyond the bounds of any single identity or organization.</p><p>One of the things that drew me to Transmute — and more broadly to emergent technology like decentralized identities and verifiable credentials — is that the open network style is often the default culture of engagement. In fact, this approach is necessary in the face of pre-competitive table stakes like technical interoperability as well as collaborative engagement and advocacy in the broader regulatory environment. Essentially, the adoption of this technology is far bigger than any one of us, and we have to work together to build the market and adoption we want to see in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>This open, generous network ethos aligns with the future I want to be part of, both with the organizations I help build and personally as a self-actualizing and social human. Part of the “crafted self” we talk about as identity workers includes the ability to be selectively multi-dimensional beings across different settings. To me this includes the freedom to traverse organizations and even industries as our interests take us, and to carry our reputation and relationships along that journey. Viewed in this way, the interoperability and autonomy values woven into the foundations of decentralized tech become further tools that can help bring to bear an even more generous&nbsp;world.</p><p>A huge thank you to the<a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk"> Transmute Team</a> — particularly <a href="https://medium.com/@karylfowler">Karyl Fowler</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@OR13">Orie Steele</a> — for leading the way, both as technologists and founders, in making the bet that movement across systems and organizations is a win for all parties involved (be they verifiable trade documents or prior employees). It has been a pleasure to work for and with you over the past few&nbsp;years.</p><p>***</p><p>If you are interested in some of the cross-network work happening in the decentralized tech space you can also check out the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> working groups, the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop</a>, the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP Foundation</a>, and the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/svip">Department of Homeland Security Silicon Valley Innovation Program</a> (to name just a&nbsp;few!).</p>Jumping off, jumping in!

    The last article was about being <a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo/the-railroad-of-no-choice-a55420cea06f">railroaded</a> in the first 100 days, recognising that you are forced into a decision.&nbsp; In this one I wanted to unpack that “data” shows that using science in an argument (say to defend against railroading) just makes the members of the team more partisan (aligned to their own confirmation bias and opinions).&nbsp; As the #CDO, your job is to use data and science, therefore in the first 100 days, with this insight, you are more likely to lose more people than win friends, lose more arguments than win and create bigger hurdles? &nbsp; What I suggest, based on this work is that to overcome “proof by science” is to use curiosity to bring us together. <p></p><p>Image source: from a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/curious-leader-douglas-longenecker/">good article</a> by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/douglaslongenecker/">Douglas Longenecker</a></p><p>---</p><p><a href="https://law.yale.edu/dan-m-kahan">Dan Kahan</a>, a Yale behavioural economist, has spent the last decade studying whether the use of reason aggravates or reduces “partisan” beliefs. His research papers are <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=45442">here</a>. His research shows that aggravation and alienation easily win, irrespective of being more liberal or conservative. The more we use our faculties for scientific thought, the more likely we are to take a strong position that aligns with our (original) political group (or thought).&nbsp;</p><p>A way through this is to copy “<a href="https://www.solutionsjournalism.org/">solution journalism</a>” which reports on ways that people and governments meaningfully respond to difficult problems and not on what the data says the problem is. Rather than use our best insights, analysis and thinking to reach the version of the “truth”, we use data to find ways to agree with others opinions in our communities. We help everyone to become curious. &nbsp; I use the<a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/"> Peak Paradox</a> framework as an approach to remaining curious as to where we are aligned and where there is a delta.&nbsp;</p><p>What happens when we use data and science in our arguments and explain what the problem is, is that the individuals will selectively credit and discredit information in patterns that reflect their commitment to certain values. They (we) (I) assimilate what they (we)(I) want.&nbsp;</p><p>Kahan, in 2014, <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2459057">asked over 1,500 respondents</a> whether they agreed or disagreed with the following statement: “There is solid evidence of recent global warming due mostly to human activity such as burning fossil fuels.” They collected information on individuals political beliefs, and rated their science intelligence.” The analysis found that those with the least science intelligence actually have less partisan positions than those with the most. A Conservative with strong science intelligence will use their skills to find evidence against human-caused global warming, while a Liberal will find evidence for it (cognitive bias.)&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>In the chart above, the y-axis represents the probability of a person agreeing that human activity caused climate change, and x-axis represents the percentile a person scored on the scientific knowledge test. The width of the bars shows the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval">confidence interval</a> for that probability.</p><p>As a CDO a most disconcerting finding is that individuals with more “scientific intelligence” are the quickest to align themselves on subjects they don’t know anything about. In one experiment, Kahan analyzed how people’s opinions on an <a href="http://www.nanotechproject.org/file_download/files/NanotechRiskPerceptions-DanKahan.pdf">unfamiliar subject</a> is affected when given some basic scientific information, along with details about what people in their self-identified political group tend to believe about that subject. It turned out that those with the strongest scientific reasoning skills were the ones most likely to use the information to develop partisan opinions.</p><p>Critically Kahan’s research shows that people that score well on a measure called “scientific curiosity” actually show less partisanship, and it is this aspect we need to use.</p><p>As CDO’s, we need to move away from “truth”, “facts”, “data” and “right decisions” if we want to have a board and senior team who can become aligned.&nbsp; We need to present ideas, concepts, how others are finding solutions and make our teams more curious.&nbsp; Being curious appears to be the best way to bring us together - however counterintuitive that is.</p><br><p>-----</p><p>Whilst our ongoing agile iteration into <a href="https://opengovernance.net/what-occurs-when-physical-beings-transition-to-information-beings-146ea9dcbca3">information beings</a> is never-ending, there are the first 100 days in the new role. But what to focus on? Well, that rose-tinted period of conflicting priorities is what <a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo/">&lt;/Hello, CDO!&gt;</a> is all about. Maintaining sanity when all else has been lost to untested data assumptions is a different problem entirely.</p> <br>

    Questions to help frame your own paradoxes <p>Leadership must be <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/post/in-leadership-why-is-recognising-paradox-critically-important">able to recognise the paradoxes created</a> as they decide on “<a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/post/what-are-we-optimising-for">what they are optimising for.</a>” The last article described two different starting points for the Peak Paradox model; <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/post/hello-world">finding paradox</a> and<a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/post/plotting-how-to-make-better-decisions"> living with paradox</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>It is evident that the compromises we elect to live with become more focused as we agreed or decide on what we are optimising for.&nbsp; Such a focus has a benefit insomuch that the narrower and more articulate our view of optimised becomes, the more <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/post/plotting-how-to-make-better-decisions">decisions can become aligned</a>. However, the counter is that whilst a sharp focus and alignment will require less compromise for some, but it will equally increase the paradoxes/ compromises and tensions others will have to live with.&nbsp; One team can be aligned to a vision but not necessarily on how to get there or live with the chosen “optimised” approach.&nbsp; Stress is created by these differences and can create cracks and weaknesses in the team and culture. One vision, one culture, one team is very naive in any team more extensive than one.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Sufficient dwell or thinking time is often not afforded to executive and leadership teams. Indeed board agendas are so packed and time so restricted there is little opportunity to debate or descent. The consequence of this reality is that insufficient time is allowed to consider the impacts of your optimising choices on others.&nbsp; Therefore over the next few posts, I will offer questions at different levels as per the <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/post/plotting-how-to-make-better-decisions">decision model</a> (below.)&nbsp; This is a <a href="https://opengovernance.net/choice-decision-making-and-judgment-is-your-relationship-constructive-or-destructive-c0e3b076e0a6">link</a> to a longer article on <a href="https://opengovernance.net/choice-decision-making-and-judgment-is-your-relationship-constructive-or-destructive-c0e3b076e0a6">choices, decisions, and judgment</a> as it frames; “are we asking the right questions?”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The outer yellow ring is the focus of this article. Below are five questions per “Peak” that should help facilitate a conversation to maximise benefits within this space or improve understanding of the compromises other will have to make to come to your peak.&nbsp;</p><p></p><br><br><p>As a reminder of what the peaks represent.&nbsp; The original <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/post/hello-world">detailed definitions of each peak are here.&nbsp;</a></p><p>Peak Individual Purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;At the exclusion of anything else, you are only interested in yourself.&nbsp; Selflessness at the extreme.&nbsp; You believe that you are sovereign (not having to ask anyone for permission or forgiveness), your voice and everything you say matters and everyone should agree. You are all-powerful and can do whatever you want and have the freedom and agency to do it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Peak Work Purpose.&nbsp; At the exclusion of anything else, the only reason to work is to deliver as much possible value to the shareholders.&nbsp; Employees, customers, the environment does not matter in terms of exploitation.&nbsp; The purpose is to be the biggest and most efficient beast on the planet and able to deliver enormous returns; Shareholder Primacy at its most pure. Simple, clear, no conflict and no compromise, even to the point that rewarding the staff beyond fair would be a compromise.&nbsp; Compliance is met with the minimal standard ensuring that nothing is wasted.&nbsp; (note: it is not the reason an individual works, but a company works)</p><p>Peak Society Purpose. &nbsp;At the exclusion of anything else, we have to deliver and ensure there is no suffering and poverty for any living thing. Humans must have equal education, health and safety.&nbsp; There must be total transparency and equality.&nbsp; Everything is equally shared, and on-one has more power, agency or influence than anyone else.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Peak Human Purpose.&nbsp; At the exclusion of anything else, we are here to escape death which we do by reproducing as much as we can with the broadest community we can.&nbsp; We also have to adapt as fast as possible.&nbsp; We have to meet our chemistry requirements to stay alive for as long as possible to adopt and reproduce at the expense of anything else.&nbsp; Whilst all the peak purposes might be controversial (even to myself), saying purity of human purpose in chemistry/ biology might not go down very well. However, this is a model for framing thinking, so please go with it as it needs to be pure, and every other human purpose has conflicts with someone.</p><p>How would you answer these questions?</p><p></p><p></p><p>It should be evident that these questions try to frame you towards a natural one peak, but even at this level, you will have noticed that whilst you will align more to one peak than the others, but that you are full of paradoxes.&nbsp; Ask different questions, you will align to a different north star.&nbsp;</p><br><br><br>

<p>In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/07/24/pl-pgsql-versus-pl-python-heres-why-im-using-both-to-write-postgres-functions/">episode 2</a> of this series I noted that the languages in which I’m writing Postgres functions share a common type system. It took me a while to understand how types work in the context of Postgres functions that can return sets of records and can interact with tables and materialized views.</p>
<p>Here is a set-returning function.</p>
 create function notes_for_user_in_group(
  _userid text, 
  _groupid text)
returns setof annotation as $$
  begin
    return query 
      select * from annotation
      where userid = concat('acct:', _userid)
      and groupid = _groupid;
  end;
$$ language plpgsql;
 
<p>In this case the type that governs the returned set has already been defined: it’s the schema for the annotation table.</p>



Column
Type




id
uuid


created
timestamp without time zone


updated
timestamp without time zone

target_uri

target_uri_normalized

target_selectors

document_id

<p>The function returns records matching a userid and groupid. I can now find the URLs of documents most recently annotated by me.</p>
 select
  target_uri
from notes_for_user_in_group('judell@hypothes.is', '__world__')
order by created desc
limit 3;
 
<p>The Postgres response:</p>
                  target_uri                  
---------------------------------------------
 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20020501
 https://www.infoworld.com/article/2886828/github-for-the-rest-of-us.html
 https://web.hypothes.is/help/formatting-annotations-with-markdown/
 http://example.com                          
(3 rows)
 
<p>You might wonder why the function’s parameters are prefixed with underscores. That’s because variables used in functions can conflict with names of columns in tables. Since none of our column names begin with underscore, it’s a handy differentiator. Suppose the function’s signature were instead:</p>
 create function notes_for_user_in_group(
  userid text, 
  groupid text)
 
<p>Postgres would complain about a confict:</p>
 ERROR:  column reference "userid" is ambiguous
LINE 2:       where userid = concat('acct:', userid)
                    ^
DETAIL:  It could refer to either a PL/pgSQL variable or a table column.
 
<p>The table has userid and groupid columns that conflict with their eponymous variables. So for functions that combine variables and database values I prefix variable names with underscore.</p>
<p>Set-returning functions can be called in any SQL SELECT context. In the example above that context is psql, Postgres’ powerful and multi-talented REPL (read-eval-print loop). For an example of a different context, let’s cache the function’s result set in a materialized view.</p>
 create materialized view public_notes_for_judell as (
  select
    *
  from notes_for_user_in_group('judell@hypothes.is', '__world__')
  order by created desc
) with data;
 
<p>Postgres reports success by showing the new view’s record count.</p>
 SELECT 3972
 
<p>The view’s type is implicitly annotation; its schema matches the one shown above; selecting target_uri from the view is equivalent to selecting target_uri from the setof annotation returned from the function notes_for_user_in_group.</p>
 select
  target_uri
from public_notes_for_judell
limit 3;
 
<p>The Postgres response is the same as above.</p>
                  target_uri                  
---------------------------------------------
 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20020501
 https://www.infoworld.com/article/2886828/github-for-the-rest-of-us.html
 https://web.hypothes.is/help/formatting-annotations-with-markdown/
 http://example.com                          
(3 rows)
 
<p>It shows up a lot faster though! Every time you select the function’s result set, the wrapped query has to run. For this particular example that can take a few seconds. It costs the same amount of time to create the view. But once that’s done you can select its contents in milliseconds.</p>
<p>Now let’s define a function that refines notes_for_user_in_group by reporting the count of notes for each annotated document.</p>
 create function annotated_docs_for_user_in_group(
  _userid text, 
  _groupid text)
returns table (
  count bigint,
  userid text,
  groupid text,
  url text
) as $$
  begin
    return query
      select
        count(n.*) as anno_count,
        n.userid,
        n.groupid,
        n.target_uri
      from notes_for_user_in_group(_userid, _groupid) n
      group by n.userid, n.groupid, n.target_uri                          
      order by anno_count desc;
  end;
$$ language plpgsql;
 
<p>Instead of returning a setof some named type, this function returns an anonymous table. I’ve aliased the set-returning function call notes_for_user_in_group as n and used the alias to qualify the names of selected columns. That avoids another naming conflict. If you write userid instead of n.userid in the body of the function and then call it, Postgres again complains about a conflict.</p>
 ERROR:  column reference "userid" is ambiguous
LINE 3:         userid,
                ^
DETAIL:  It could refer to either a PL/pgSQL variable or a table column.
 
<p>Here’s a sample call to our new function..</p>
 select 
  *
from annotated_docs_for_user_in_group(
  'judell',
  'hypothes.is',
  '__world__'
);
 
<p>The result:</p>
  count | userid             | groupid   | target_uri
-------+---------------------------------------------
   516 | judell@hypothes.is | __world__ | http://shakespeare.mit.edu/macbeth/full.html
    73 | judell@hypothes.is | __world__ | https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/india-floods-bangladesh-nepal-deaths-millions-homeless-latest-news-updates-a7919006.html

<p>Now let’s create a view based on that function.</p>
 create materialized view url_counts_for_public_notes_by_judell as (
  select 
    *
  from annotated_docs_for_user_in_group(
    'judell@hypothes.is',
    '__world__'
  )
) with data;
 
<p>Postgres says:</p>
 SELECT 1710
 
<p>When you ask for the definition of that view using the \d command in psql:</p>
<p>\d url_counts_for_public_notes_by_judell</p>
<p>It responds with the same table definition used when creating the function.</p>
  Column  |  Type  
---------+--------
 count   | bigint
 userid  | text
 groupid | text
 url     | text   
 
<p>Behind the scenes Postgres has created this definition from the anonymous table returned by the function.</p>
<p>To revise the function so that it uses a named type, first create the type.</p>
 create type annotated_docs_for_user_in_group as (
  count bigint,
  userid text,
  groupid text,
  url text
);
 
<p>Postgres reports success:</p>
 CREATE TYPE
 
<p>Now we can use that named type in the function. Since we’re redefining the function, first drop it.</p>
 drop function annotated_docs_for_user_in_group;
 
<p>Uh oh. Postgres is unhappy about that.</p>
 ERROR:  cannot drop function annotated_docs_for_user_in_group(text,text) because other objects depend on it
DETAIL:  materialized view url_counts_for_public_notes_by_judell depends on function annotated_docs_for_user_in_group(text,text)
HINT:  Use DROP ... CASCADE to drop the dependent objects too.
 
<p>A view that depends on a function must be recreated when the function’s signature changes. I’ll say more about this in a future episode on set-returning functions that dynamically cache their results in materialized views. For now, since the view we just created is a contrived throwaway, just drop it along with the function by using CASCADE as Postgres recommends.</p>
 drop function annotated_docs_for_user_in_group cascade;
 
<p>Postgres says:</p>
 NOTICE:  drop cascades to materialized view url_counts_for_public_notes_by_judell
DROP FUNCTION
 
<p>Now we can recreate a version of the function that returns setof annotated_docs_for_user_in_group instead of an anonymous table(...)</p>
 create function annotated_docs_for_user_in_group(
  _userid text, 
  _groupid text)
returns setof annotated_docs_for_user_in_group as $$
  begin
    return query
      select
        count(n.*) as anno_count,
        n.userid,
        n.groupid,
        n.target_uri
      from notes_for_user_in_group(_userid, _groupid) n
      group by n.userid, n.groupid, n.target_uri                          
      order by anno_count desc;
  end;
$$ language plpgsql;
 
<p>The results are the same as above. So why do it this way? In many cases I don’t. It’s extra overhead to declare a type. And just as a view can depend on a function, a function can depend on a type. To see why you might not want such dependencies, suppose we want to also track the most recent note for each URL.</p>
 create type annotated_docs_for_user_in_group as (
  count bigint,
  userid text,
  groupid text,
  url text,
  most_recent_note timestamp
);
 
<p>That won’t work.</p>
 ERROR:  type "annotated_docs_for_user_in_group" already exists
 
<p>Dropping the type won’t work either.</p>
 ERROR:  cannot drop type annotated_docs_for_user_in_group because other objects depend on it                           
DETAIL:  function annotated_docs_for_user_in_group(text,text,text) depends on type annotated_docs_for_user_in_group    
HINT:  Use DROP ... CASCADE to drop the dependent objects too.
 
<p>To redefine the type you have to do a cascading drop and then recreate functions that depend on the type. If any of those views depend on dropped functions, the drop cascades to them as well and they also must be recreated. That’s why I often write functions that return table(...) rather than setof TYPE. In dynamic languages it’s convenient to work with untyped bags of values; I find the same to be true when writing functions in Postgres.</p>
<p>Sometimes, though, it’s useful to declare and use types. In my experience so far it makes most sense to do that in Postgres when you find yourself writing the same returns table(...) statement in several related functions. Let’s say we want a function that combines the results of annotated_docs_for_user_in_group for some set of users.</p>
 create function annotated_docs_for_users_in_group(_userids text[], _groupid text)
  returns setof annotated_docs_for_user_in_group as $$
    begin
      return query 
        with userids as (
          select unnest(_userids) as userid
        )
        select 
          a.*
        from userids u
        join annotated_docs_for_user_in_group(u.userid, _groupid) a
          on a.userid = concat('acct:', u.userid);
    end;
$$ language plpgsql;
 
<p>This new function uses the SQL WITH clause to create a common table expression (CTE) that converts an inbound array of userids into a transient table-like object, named userids, with one userid per row. The new function’s wrapped SQL then joins that CTE to the set returned from annotated_docs_for_user_in_group and returns the joined result.</p>
<p>(You can alternatively do this in a more procedural way by creating a loop variable and marching through the array to accumulate results. Early on I used that approach but in the context of Postgres functions I’ve come to prefer the more purely SQL-like set-oriented style.)</p>
<p>Sharing a common type between the two functions makes them simpler to write and easier to read. More importantly it connects them to one another and to all views derived from them. If I do decide to add most_recent_note to the type, Postgres will require me to adjust all depending functions and views so things remain consistent. That can be a crucial guarantee, and as we’ll see in a future episode it’s a key enabler of an advanced caching mechanism.</p>

  <p>Summary: Picos are a programming model for building decentralized applications that provide significant benefits in the form of abstractions that reduce programmer effort. Here are ten eleven reasons you should use picos for your next decentralized application.</p>



    <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/02/building_decentralized_applications_with_pico_networks.shtml"></a>
	  Temperature Sensor Network Built from Picos


<p>
    I didn't start out to write a programming language that naturally supports decentralized programming using the actor-model, is cloud-native, serverless, and databaseless. Indeed, if I had, I likely wouldn't have succeeded. Instead picos evolved from a simple rule language for modifying web pages to a powerful, general-purpose programming system for building any decentralized application. This post explains what picos are and why they are a great way to build decentralized systems. 
</p>

<p>
    Picos are persistent compute objects. Persistence is a core feature that distinguishes picos from other programming models. Picos exhibit persistence in three ways:
</p> 
     Persistent identity—Picos exist, with a single identity, continuously from the moment of their creation until they are destroyed. 
     Persistent state—Picos have persistent state that programs running in the pico can see and alter. The state is is isolated and only available inside the pico. 
     Persistent availability—Once a pico is created, it is always on and ready to process queries and events.
     
 
<p></p>

<p>
    Persistent identity, state, and availability make picos ideal for modeling entities of all sorts. Applications are formed from cooperating networks of picos, creating systems that better match programmer's mental models. Picos employ the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">actor model</a> abstraction for distributed computation. Specifically, in response to a received message, a pico may
</p>
 
     send messages to other picos—Picos <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2013/12/pico_apis_events_and_queries.shtml">respond to events and queries</a> by running rules. Depending on the rules installed, a pico may raise events for itself or other picos. 
     create other picos—Picos can create child picos and delete them.  
     change its internal state (which can affect their behavior when the next message is received)—Each pico has a set of persistent variables that can only be affected by rules that run in response to events. 
 

<p>
    In addition to the parent-child hierarchy, picos can be arranged in a heterachical network for peer-to-peer communication and computation. A cooperating network of picos reacts to messages, changes state, and sends messages. Picos have an internal event bus for distributing those messages to rules installed in the pico. Rules in the pico are selected to run based on declarative <a href="https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/pages/1189912/Event+Expressions">event expressions</a>. The pico matches events on the bus with event scenarios declared in each rule's event expressions. Any rule whose event expression matches is scheduled for execution. Executing rules may raise additional events. More detail about the <a href="https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/pages/1189951/Event+Loop+Introduction">event loop and pico execution model</a> are available elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
    Here are ten reasons picos are a great development environment for building decentralized applications:
</p>

 
     Picos can be a computational node that represents or models anything: person, place, organization, smart thing, dumb thing, concept, <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2013/04/pot_holes_and_picos.shtml">even a pothole</a>. Because picos encapsulate identity and state, they can be used to easily model entities of all types. 
     
     Picos use a substitutable hosting model. Picos are hosted on the open-source <a href="https://github.com/Picolab/pico-engine">pico engine</a>. Picos can be moved from pico engine to pico engine without loss of functionality or a change in their identifying features1. More importantly, an application built using picos can employ picos running on multiple engines without programmer effort. 
     
     Pico-based applications are scalable. Picos provide a decentralized programming model which ensures that an application can use whatever number of picos it needs without locks or multi-threading. Pico-based applications are fully sharded, meaning there is a computational node with isolated state for every entity of interest. Because these nodes can run on different engines without loss of functionality or programmer effort, pico-based applications scale fluidly. Picos provide an architectural model for <a href="https://www.rtinsights.com/event-processing-internet-things-trillion-node-network/">trillion-node networks</a> where literally everything is online. This provides a better, <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/07/alternatives_to_the_compuserve_of_things.shtml">more scalable model for IoT than the current CompuServe of Things</a>. 
     
     Picos can provide high availability in spite of potentially unreliable hosting. Multiple picos, stored in many places can be used to represent a specific entity. Picos modeling a popular web page, for example, could be replicated countless times to ensure the web page is available when needed with low latency. Copies would be eventually consistent with one another and no backups would be needed. 
     
     Picos are naturally concurrent without the need for locks. Each pico is an island of determinism that can be used as a building block for non-determinant decentralized systems. Each pico is isolated from any other pico, asynchronous processing is the default, and facts about the pico are published through protocols. State changes are determined by rules and respond to incoming messages seen as events. This minimizes contention and supports the efficient use of resources. 
     
     Picos provide a cloud-native (internet-first) architecture that matches the application architecture to the cloud model. The pico programming model lets developers focus on business logic, not infrastructure. Applications built with picos don't merely reside in the cloud. They are architected to be performant while decentralized. Picos support <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2016/04/reactive_programming_patterns_examples_from_fuse.shtml#event_errors">reactive programming patterns</a> that ensure applications are decoupled in both space and time to the extent possible. 
     
     Picos enable stateful, databaseless programming. Picos model domain objects in code, not in database tables. Developers don't waste time setting up, configuring, or maintaining a database. Each ruleset forms a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)">closure</a> over the set of persistent variables used in it. Programmers simply use a variable and it is automatically persisted and available whenever a rule or function in the ruleset is executed. 
     
     Picos use an extensible service model where new functionality can be layered on. Functionality within a pico is provided by rules that respond to events. An event-based programming model ensures <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2014/07/fuse_as_a_microservice_architecture.shtml">services inside a pico are loosely coupled</a>. And isolation of state changes between services (implemented as rulesets) inside the pico ensure a new service can be added without interfering with existing services. An event can select new rules while also selecting existing rules without the programmer changing the control flow2. 
     
     Picos naturally support a <a href="https://principles.reactive.foundation/principles/index.html">Reactive programming model</a>. Reactive programming with picos directly addresses the challenges of building decentralized applications through abstractions, programming models, data handling, protocols, interaction schemes, and error handling3.  In a pico application, distribution is first class and decentralization is natural. You can read more about this in <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/02/building_decentralized_applications_with_pico_networks.shtml">Building Decentralized Applications with Pico Networks</a> and <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2016/04/reactive_programming_patterns_examples_from_fuse.shtml">Reactive Programming Patterns: Examples from Fuse</a>.
     
     Picos provide better control over terms, apps, and data. This is a natural result of the pico model where each thing has a closure over services and data. Picos cleanly separate the data for different entities. Picos, representing a specific entity, and microservices, representing a specific business capability within the pico, provide fine grained control over data and its processing. For example, if you <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/12/relationships_in_the_self-sovereign_internet_of_things.shtml#selling">sell your car, you can transfer the vehicle pico to the new owner</a>, after deleting the trip service, and its associated data, while leaving untouched the maintenance records, which are stored as part of the maintenance service in the pico.
     
 

<p>
    And a bonus reason for using picos:
</p>

 
     Picos provide a better model for building the Internet of Things. Picos are an antidote to the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/07/alternatives_to_the_compuserve_of_things.shtml">CompuServe of Things</a> because they provide a scalable, decentralized model for connecting everything. We built a connected car platform called Fuse to prove this model works (<a href="https://www.windley.com/tags/fuse.shtml">read more about Fuse</a>). Picos are a natural building block for the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/12/the_self-sovereign_internet_of_things.shtml">self-sovereign internet of things (SSIoT)</a> and can easily model necessary <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/12/relationships_in_the_self-sovereign_internet_of_things.shtml">IoT relationship</a>. Picos create an IoT architecture that allows interoperable interactions between devices from different manufacturers.

 Notes 

 
     The caveat on this statement is that pico engines currently use URLs to identify channels used for inter-pico communication. Moving to a different engine could change the URLs that identify channels because the domain name of the engine changes. These changes can be automated. Future developments on the roadmap will reduce the use of domain names in the pico engine to make moving picos from engine to engine even easier.
     
     
        Note that while rules within a ruleset are guaranteed to execute in the order they appear, rules selected from different rulesets for the same event offer no ordering guarantee. When ordering is necessary, this can be done using <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2016/04/reactive_programming_patterns_examples_from_fuse.shtml#intra_pico_event_patterns">rule chaining, guard rules, and idempotence</a>. 
     
     I first heard this expressed by Jonas Bonér in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5kek8vx2ws&amp;t=1s">Reactive Summit 2020 Keynote</a>.

<p>This article shows how to implement an ASP.NET Core Razor page to authenticate against Azure B2C and use Web APIs from a second ASP.NET Core application which are also protected using Azure B2C App registrations. Azure B2C uses the signin, signup user flow and allows identities to authenticate using an Azure AD single tenant. Two APIs are implemented, one for users and one for administrators. Only identities from the Azure AD tenant can use the administrator API. The authorization implementation which forces this, is supported using an ASP.NET Core policy with a handler. </p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/azureb2c-fed-azuread">https://github.com/damienbod/azureb2c-fed-azuread</a></p>



<p>Setup</p>



<p>The ASP.NET Core applications only use Azure B2C to authenticate and authorize. An ASP.NET Core Razor page application is used for the UI, but this can be any SPA, Blazor app or whatever the preferred tech stack is. The APIs are implemented using ASP.NET Core and this uses Azure B2C to validate and authorize the access tokens. The application accepts two different access tokens from the same Azure B2C identity provider. Each API has a separate scope from the associating Azure App registration. The Admin API uses claims specific to the Azure AD identity to authorize only Azure AD internal users. Other identities cannot use this API and this needs to be validated. The Azure B2C identity provider federates to the Azure AD single tenant App registration. </p>







<p>Setup Azure B2C App registrations</p>



<p>Three Azure App registrations were created in Azure B2C to support the setup above. Two for the APIs and one for the UI. The API Azure App registrations are standard with just a scope definition. The scope access_as_user was exposed in both and the APIs can be used for user access.</p>



<p>The UI Azure App registration is setup to use an Azure B2C user flow and will have access to both APIs. You need to select the options with the user flows.</p>







<p>Add the APIs to the permissions of the Azure app registration for the UI application.</p>







<p>Setup Azure AD App registration</p>



<p>A single tenant Azure App registration needs to be created in the Azure AD for the internal or admin users. The redirect URL for this is <a href="https://”your-tenant-specific-path”/oauth2/authresp">https://”your-tenant-specific-path”/oauth2/authresp</a>. This will be used from an Azure B2C social login using the Open ID Connect provider. You also need to define a user secret and use this later. At present only secrets can be defined in this UI. This is problematic because the secrets have a max expiry of 2 years, if defining this in the portal.</p>







<p>Setup Azure B2C identity provider</p>



<p>A custom identity provider needs to be created to access the single tenant Azure AD for the admin identity authentication. Select the Identity providers in Azure B2C and create a new Open ID Connect custom IDP. Add the data to match the Azure App registration created in the previous step.</p>







<p>Setup Azure B2C user flow </p>



<p>Now a signin, signup user flow can be created to implement the Azure B2C authentication process and the registration process. This will allow local Azure B2C guest users and also the internal administrator users from the Azure AD tenant. The idp claim is required and idp_access_token claim if you require user data from the Azure AD identity. Add the required claims when creating the user flow. The claims can be added when creating the user flow in the User attributes and token claims section. Select the custom Open ID Connect provider and add this to the flow as well.</p>







<p>The user flow is now setup. The Azure App registrations can now be used to login and use either API as required. The idp and the idp_access_token are added for the Azure AD sign-in and this can be validated when using the admin API. </p>



<p>Implementing ASP.NET Core Razor page with Microsoft.Identity.Web</p>



<p>The ASP.NET Core application is secured using the Microsoft.Identity.Web and the Microsoft.Identity.Web.UI Nuget packages. These packages implement the Open ID connect clients and handles the Azure B2C specific client handling. The AddMicrosoftIdentityWebAppAuthentication method is used to add this and the AzureAdB2C configuration is defined to read the configuration from the app.settings, user secrets, key vault or whatever deployment is used. The rest is standard ASP.NET Core setup.</p>


  public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
	services.AddTransient&lt;AdminApiOneService&gt;();
	services.AddTransient&lt;UserApiOneService&gt;();
	services.AddHttpClient();

	services.AddOptions();

	string[] initialScopes = Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("UserApiOne:ScopeForAccessToken")?.Split(' ');

	services.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebAppAuthentication(Configuration, "AzureAdB2C")
		.EnableTokenAcquisitionToCallDownstreamApi(initialScopes)
		.AddInMemoryTokenCaches();

	services.AddRazorPages().AddMvcOptions(options =&gt;
	{
		var policy = new AuthorizationPolicyBuilder()
			.RequireAuthenticatedUser()
			.Build();
		options.Filters.Add(new AuthorizeFilter(policy));
	}).AddMicrosoftIdentityUI();
}

public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
	if (env.IsDevelopment())
	{
		app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
	}
	else
	{
		app.UseExceptionHandler("/Error");
		app.UseHsts();
	}

	app.UseHttpsRedirection();
	app.UseStaticFiles();

	app.UseRouting();

	app.UseAuthentication();
	app.UseAuthorization();

	app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =&gt;
	{
		endpoints.MapRazorPages();
		endpoints.MapControllers();
	});
}
  


<p>The Micorosoft.Identity.Web package uses the AzureAdB2C settings for the configuration. This example is using Azure B2C and the configuration for Azure B2C is different to an Azure AD configuration. The Instance MUST be set to domain of the Azure B2C tenant and the SignUpSignInPolicyId must be set to use the user flow as required. A signin, signup user flow is used here. The rest is common for be Azure AD and Azure B2C settings. The ScopeForAccessToken matches the two Azure App registrations created for the APIs.</p>

	"Instance": "https://b2cdamienbod.b2clogin.com",

},
  


<p>The Admin Razor page uses the AuthorizeForScopes to authorize for the API it uses. This Razor page uses the API service to access the admin API. No authorization is implemented in the UI to validate the identity. Normally the page would be hidden if the identity is not an administrator , I left this out in so that it is easier to validate this in the API as this is only a demo.</p>


  namespace AzureB2CUI.Pages
{
    [AuthorizeForScopes(Scopes = new string[] { "https://b2cdamienbod.onmicrosoft.com/5f4e8bb1-3f4e-4fc6-b03c-12169e192cd7/access_as_user" })]
    public class CallAdminApiModel : PageModel
    {
        private readonly AdminApiOneService _apiService;

        public JArray DataFromApi { get; set; }
        public CallAdminApiModel(AdminApiOneService apiService)
        {
            _apiService = apiService;
        }

        public async Task OnGetAsync()
        {
            DataFromApi = await _apiService.GetApiDataAsync().ConfigureAwait(false);
        }
    }
}
  


<p>The API service uses the ITokenAcquisition to get an access token for the defined scope. If the identity and the Azure App registration are authorized to access the API, then an access token is returned for the identity. This is sent using a HttpClient created using the IHttpClientFactory interface.</p>


  using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using Microsoft.Identity.Web;
using Newtonsoft.Json.Linq;
using System;
using System.Net.Http;
using System.Net.Http.Headers;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace AzureB2CUI
{
    public class AdminApiOneService
    {
        private readonly IHttpClientFactory _clientFactory;
        private readonly ITokenAcquisition _tokenAcquisition;
        private readonly IConfiguration _configuration;

        public AdminApiOneService(IHttpClientFactory clientFactory, 
            ITokenAcquisition tokenAcquisition, 
            IConfiguration configuration)
        {
            _clientFactory = clientFactory;
            _tokenAcquisition = tokenAcquisition;
            _configuration = configuration;
        }

        public async Task&lt;JArray&gt; GetApiDataAsync()
        {

            var client = _clientFactory.CreateClient();

            var scope = _configuration["AdminApiOne:ScopeForAccessToken"];
            var accessToken = await _tokenAcquisition.GetAccessTokenForUserAsync(new[] { scope }).ConfigureAwait(false);

            client.BaseAddress = new Uri(_configuration["AdminApiOne:ApiBaseAddress"]);
            client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", accessToken);
            client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Accept.Add(new MediaTypeWithQualityHeaderValue("application/json"));

            var response = await client.GetAsync("adminaccess").ConfigureAwait(false);
            if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
            {
                var responseContent = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync().ConfigureAwait(false);
                var data = JArray.Parse(responseContent);

                return data;
            }

            throw new ApplicationException($"Status code: {response.StatusCode}, Error: {response.ReasonPhrase}");
        }
    }
}

  


<p>Implementing the APIs with Microsoft.Identity.Web </p>



<p>The ASP.NET Core project implements the two separate APIs using separate authentication schemes and policies. The AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApiAuthentication method configures services for the user API using the default JWT scheme “Bearer” and the second scheme is setup for the “BearerAdmin” JWT bearer auth for the admin API. All API calls require an authenticated user which is setup in the AddControllers using a global policy. The AddAuthorization method is used to add an authorization policy for the admin API. The IsAdminHandler handler is used to fulfil the IsAdminRequirement requirement.</p>


  public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
	services.AddHttpClient();

	services.AddOptions();

	JwtSecurityTokenHandler.DefaultInboundClaimTypeMap.Clear();
	// IdentityModelEventSource.ShowPII = true;

	services.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApiAuthentication(
		Configuration, "AzureB2CUserApi");

	services.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApiAuthentication(
	   Configuration, "AzureB2CAdminApi", "BearerAdmin");

	services.AddControllers(options =&gt;
	{
		var policy = new AuthorizationPolicyBuilder()
			.RequireAuthenticatedUser()
			 // disabled this to test with users that have no email (no license added)
		     // .RequireClaim("email")
			.Build();
		options.Filters.Add(new AuthorizeFilter(policy));
	});

	services.AddSingleton&lt;IAuthorizationHandler, IsAdminHandler&gt;();

	services.AddAuthorization(options =&gt;
	{
		options.AddPolicy("IsAdminRequirementPolicy", policyIsAdminRequirement =&gt;
		{
			policyIsAdminRequirement.Requirements.Add(new IsAdminRequirement());
		});
	});
}
  


<p>The IsAdminHandler class checks for the idp claim and validates that the single tenant we require for admin identities is used to sign-in. The access token needs to be validated that the token was issued by our Azure B2C and that it has the correct scope. Since this is done in using the Microsoft.Identity.Web attributes, we don’t need to do this here. </p>


  public class IsAdminHandler : AuthorizationHandler&lt;IsAdminRequirement&gt;
{
	protected override Task HandleRequirementAsync(
		AuthorizationHandlerContext context, IsAdminRequirement requirement)
	{
		if (context == null)
			throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(context));
		if (requirement == null)
			throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(requirement));

		var claimIdentityprovider = context.User.Claims.FirstOrDefault(t =&gt; t.Type == "idp");

		// check that our tenant was used to signin
		if (claimIdentityprovider != null 
			&amp;&amp; claimIdentityprovider.Value == 
				"https://login.microsoftonline.com/7ff95b15-dc21-4ba6-bc92-824856578fc1/v2.0")
		{
			context.Succeed(requirement);
		}

		return Task.CompletedTask;
	}
}
  


<p>The AdminAccessController class is used to provide the admin data for admin identities. The BearerAdmin scheme is required and the IsAdminRequirementPolicy policy. The access token admin scope is also validated.</p>


  [Authorize(AuthenticationSchemes = "BearerAdmin", Policy = "IsAdminRequirementPolicy")]
[AuthorizeForScopes(Scopes = new string[] { "api://5f4e8bb1-3f4e-4fc6-b03c-12169e192cd7/access_as_user" })]
[ApiController]
[Route("[controller]")]
public class AdminAccessController : ControllerBase
{
	[HttpGet]
	public List&lt;string&gt; Get()
	{
		string[] scopeRequiredByApi = new string[] { "access_as_user" };
		HttpContext.VerifyUserHasAnyAcceptedScope(scopeRequiredByApi);

		return new List&lt;string&gt; { "admin data" };
	}
}
  


<p>The user API also validates the access token, this time using the default Bearer scheme. No policy is required here, so only the default global authorization filter is used. The user API scope is validated.</p>


  [Authorize(AuthenticationSchemes = "Bearer")]
[AuthorizeForScopes(Scopes = new string[] { "api://723191f4-427e-4f77-93a8-0a62dac4e080/access_as_user" })]
[ApiController]
[Route("[controller]")]
public class UserAccessController : ControllerBase
  


<p>When the application is run, the Azure B2C user flow is used to authenticate and internal or external users can sign-in, sign-up. This view can be customized to match your styles.</p>







<p>Admins can use the admin API and the guest users can use the user APIs.</p>







<p>Notes</p>



<p>This works but it can be improved and there are other ways to achieve this setup. If you require only a subset of identities from the Azure AD tenant, an enterprise app can be used to define the users which can use the Azure AD App registration. Or you can do this with an Azure group and assign this to the app and the users to the group. </p>



<p>You should also force MFA in the application for admins by validating the claims in the token and also the client ID which the token was created for. (as well as in the Azure AD tenant.)</p>



<p>Azure B2C is still using version one access tokens and seems and the federation to Azure AD does not use PKCE.</p>



<p>The Open ID Connect client requires a secret to access the Azure AD App registration. This can only be defined for a max of two years and it is not possible to use managed identities or a certificate. This means you would need to implement a secret rotation script or something so that to solution does not stop working. This is not ideal in Azure and is solved better in other IDPs. It should be possible to define long living secrets using the Powershell module and you update then with every release etc.</p>



<p>It would also be possible to use the Graph API to validate the identity accessing the admin API, user API. </p>



<p>Azure B2C API connectors could also be used to add extra claims to the tokens for usage in the application.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/07/21/a-virtuous-cycle-for-analytics/">A virtuous cycle for analytics</a> I noted that our library of Postgres functions is written in two languages: Postgres’ built-in pl/pgsql and the installable alternative pl/python. These share a common type system and can be used interchangeably.</p>
<p>Here’s a pl/pgsql classifier that tries to match the name of a course against a list of patterns that characterize the humanities.</p>
 create function humanities_classifier(course_name text) returns boolean as $$
  begin
    return
      lower(course_name) ~ any(array[
        'psych',
        'religio',
        'soci'
        ]);
  end;
$$ language plpgsql;

# select humanities_classifier('Religious Studies 101') as match;
match
-----
t

# select humanities_classifier('Comparative Religions 200') as match;
match
-----
t
 
<p>Here is that same classifier in Python.</p>
 create function humanities_classifier(course_name text) returns boolean as $$
  sql = f"""
    select lower('{course_name}') ~ any(array[
      'psych',
      'religio',
      'soci'
      ]) as match"""
  results = plpy.execute(sql)
  return results[0]['match']
$$ language plpython3u;

# select humanities_classifier('Religious Studies 101') as match;
match
-----
t

# select humanities_classifier('Comparative Religions 200') as match;
match
-----
t
 
<p>The results are exactly the same. In this case, Python is only wrapping the SQL used in the orginal function and interpolating course_name into it. So why use pl/python here? I wouldn’t. The pl/pgsql version is cleaner and simpler because the SQL body doesn’t need to be quoted and course_name doesn’t need to be interpolated into it.</p>
<p>Here’s a more Pythonic version of the classifier.</p>
 create function humanities_classifier(course_name text) returns boolean as $$
  import re
  regexes = [
    'psych',
    'religio',
    'soci'
  ]
  matches = [r for r in regexes if re.search(r, course_name, re.I)]
  return len(matches)
$$ language plpython3u;
 
<p>There’s no SQL here, this is pure Python. Is there any benefit to doing things this way? In this case probably not. The native Postgres idiom for matching a string against a list of regular expressions is cleaner and simpler than the Python technique shown here. A Python programmer will be more familiar with list comprehensions than with the Postgres any and ~ operators but if you’re working in Postgres you’ll want to know about those, and use them not just in functions but in all SQL contexts.</p>
<p>What about performance? You might assume as I did that a pl/pgsql function is bound to be way faster than its pl/python equivalent. Let’s check that assumption. This SQL exercises both flavors of the function, which finds about 500 matches in a set of 30,000 names.</p>
 with matching_courses as (
  select humanities_classifier(name) as match
  from lms_course_groups
) 

select count(*) 
from matching_courses
where match;
 
<p>Here are the results for three runs using each flavor of the function:</p>
  pl/pgsql: 159ms, 201ms, 125ms

pl/python: 290ms, 255ms, 300ms
 
<p>The Python flavor is slower but not order-of-magnitude slower; I’ve seen cases where a pl/python function outperforms its pl/pgsql counterpart.</p>
<p>So, what is special about Python functions inside Postgres? In my experience so far there are three big reasons to use it.</p>
<p>Python modules</p>
<p>The ability to wield any of Python’s built-in or loadable modules inside Postgres brings great power. That entails great responsibility, as the Python extension is “untrusted” (that’s the ‘u’ in ‘plpython3u’) and can do anything Python can do on the host system: read and write files, make network requests.</p>
<p>Here’s one of my favorite examples so far. Given a set of rows that count daily or weekly annotations for users in a group — so for weekly accounting each row has 52 columns — the desired result for the whole group is the element-wise sum of the rows. That’s not an easy thing in SQL but it’s trivial using numpy, and in pl/python it happens at database speed because there’s no need to transfer SQL results to an external Python program.</p>
<p>Metaprogramming</p>
<p>Functions can write and then run SQL queries. It’s overkill for simple variable interpolation; as shown above pl/pgsql does that handily without the cognitive overhead and visual clutter of poking values into a SQL string. For more advanced uses that compose queries from SQL fragments, though, pl/pgsql is hopeless. You can do that kind of thing far more easily, and more readably, in Python.</p>
<p>Introspection</p>
<p>A pl/python function can discover and use its own name. That’s the key enabler for a mechanism that memoizes the results of a function by creating a materialized view whose name combines the name of the function with the value of a parameter to the function. This technique has proven to be wildly effective.</p>
<p>I’ll show examples of these scenarios in later installments of this series. For now I just want to explain why I’ve found these two ways of writing Postgres functions to be usefully complementary. The key points are:</p>
<p>– They share a common type system.</p>
<p>– pl/pgsql, despite its crusty old syntax, suffices for many things.</p>
<p>– pl/python leverages Python’s strengths where they are most strategic</p>
<p>When I began this journey it wasn’t clear when you’d prefer one over the other, or why it might make sense to use both in complementary ways. This installment is what I’d like to have known when I started.</p>

<p>（この記事は22日11時03分公開のFacebook記事からの転載です）<br>五輪のショーディレクター小林賢太郎氏のホロコーストギャグについて、サイモン・ウィーゼンタール・センターが動きましたね。</p>

<p>Suppose you’re a member of a team that runs a public web service. You need to help both internal and external users make sense of all the data that’s recorded as it runs. That’s been my role for the past few years, now it’s time to summarize what I’ve learned.</p>
<p>The web service featured in this case study is the Hypothesis web annotation system. The primary database, Postgres, stores information about users, groups, documents, courses, and annotations. Questions that our team needs to answer include:</p>
<p>– How many students created annotations last semester?</p>
<p>– In how many courses at each school?</p>
<p>Questions from instructors using Hypothesis in their courses include:</p>
<p>– Which passages in course readings are attracting highlights and discussion?</p>
<p>– Who is asking questions about those passages, and who is responding?</p>
<p>Early on we adopted a tool called Metabase that continues to be a pillar of our analytics system. When Metabase was hooked up to our Postgres database the team could start asking questions without leaning on developers. Some folks used the interactive query builder, while others went straight to writing SQL that Metabase passes through to Postgres.</p>
<p>Before long we had a large catalog of Metabase questions that query Postgres and display results as tables or charts that can be usefully arranged on Metabase dashboards. It’s all nicely RESTful. Interactive elements that can parameterize queries, like search boxes and date pickers, map to URLs. Queries can emit URLs in order to compose themselves with other queries. I came to see this system as a kind of lightweight application server in which to incubate an analytics capability that could later be expressed more richly.</p>
<p>Over time, and with growing amounts of data, early success with this approach gave way to two kinds of frustration: queries began to choke, and the catalog of Metabase questions became unmanageable. And so, in the time-honored tradition, we set up a data warehouse for analytics. Ours is another instance of Postgres that syncs nightly with the primary database. There are lots of other ways to skin the cat but it made sense to leverage ops experience with Postgres and I had a hunch that it would do well in this role.</p>
<p>To unthrottle the choking queries I began building materialized views that cache the results of Postgres queries. Suppose a query makes use of available indexes but still takes a few minutes, or maybe even an hour, to run. It still takes that long to build the corresponding materialized view, but once built other queries can use its results immediately. Metabase questions that formerly included chunks of SQL began reducing to select * from {viewname}.</p>
<p>This process continues to unfold in a highly productive way. Team members may or may not hit a performance wall as they try to use Metabase to answer their questions. When they do, we can convert the SQL text of a Metabase question to a Postgres materialized view that gets immediate results. Such views can join with others, and/or with underlying tables, in SQL SELECT contexts. The views become nouns in a language that expresses higher-order business concepts.</p>
<p>The verbs in this language turned out to be Postgres functions written in the native procedural language, pl/pgsql, and later also in its Python counterpart, pl/python. Either flavor can augment built-in Postgres library functions with user-defined functions that can return simple values, like numbers and strings, but can also return sets that behave in SQL SELECT contexts just like tables and views.</p>
<p>Functions were, at first, a way to reuse chunks of SQL that otherwise had to be duplicated across Metabase questions and Postgres CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW statements. That made it possible to streamline and refactor both bodies of code and sanely maintain them.</p>
<p>To visualize what had now become a three-body system of sources in which Metabase questions, Postgres views, and Postgres functions can call (or link to) one another, I wrote a tool that builds a crosslinked concordance. That made it practical to reason effectively about the combined system.</p>
<p>Along the way I have learned how Postgres, and more broadly <a href="https://modern-sql.com/">modern SQL</a>, in conjunction with a tool like Metabase, can enable a team like ours to make sense of data. There’s plenty to say about the techniques I’ve evolved, and I aim to write them up over time. The details won’t interest most people, but here’s an outcome that might be noteworthy.</p>
<blockquote><p>Team member: I had an idea that will help manage our communication with customers, and I’ve prototyped it in a Metabase question.</p>
<p>Toolsmith: Great! Here’s a Postgres function that encapsulates and refines your SQL. It’s fast enough for now, but if needed we can convert it into a materialized view. Now you can use that function in another Metabase question that projects your SQL across a set of customers that you can select.</p></blockquote>
<p>That interaction forms the basis of a virtuous cycle: The team member formulates a question and does their best to answer it using Metabase; the toolsmith captures the intent and re-expresses it in a higher-level business language; the expanded language enables the team member to go farther in a next cycle.</p>
<p>We recognize this software pattern in the way application programmers who push a system to its limits induce systems programmers to respond with APIs that expand those limits. I suppose it’s harder to see when the application environment is Metabase and the systems environment is Postgres. But it’s the same pattern, and it is powerful.</p>

<p>今日、故あって、銀座のエルメス・ギャラリーでやっているマチュウ・コプランによる展覧会「エキシビジョン・カッティングス」<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2021/07/4810/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-4810" title="Le Forum「エキシビジョン・カッティングス」<br>マチュウ・コプランによる展覧会&amp;#8221;Exhibition Cuttings&amp;#8221; An exhibition by Mathieu Copeland　2021.4.23（金）～7.31（土）<a href=&quot;https://www.hermes.com/jp/ja/story/maison-ginza/forum/210423/&quot;>https://www.hermes.com/jp/ja/story/maison-ginza/forum/210423/</a>">1</a>に行ってきました。アートシーンには全く疎いのですが、前回の東京オリンピックの1964年というと、日本は世界をリードしてたころでなんですね。</p>



<p>大パノラマ展とか<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2021/07/4810/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-4810" title="検索してもあんまり良い情報が出てこないので、「エキシビジョン・カッティングス」に行くのおすすめです。これに続く一連の世界での動きと合わせて勉強できます。ところで、ヨーコ・オノってすごかったんですね。">2</a></p>



<p>普通は画廊での個展は初日は華やかにレセプションとかあるものですが、これは画廊を封鎖して始まり、個展の終わりに封鎖を解いて祝って終わるという反展覧会 Anti-Exhabition。それに続く世界各地でのアートの商業化に対するアンチテーゼの動きを見て、色々考えるところがありました。</p>



<p>それの一つが、あり得たもう一つのオリンピック開会式。</p>



<p>コロナでロックダウンの時期だったんだから、それにふさわしく反開会式 Anti-Opening にして、選手は誰も入場せず、オリンピック村の自室のバルコニーにソーシャルディスタンスで並び、国立競技場にはバッハ会長他オリンピック貴族と関係者だけがいるのをずっと画面半分でTV中継、もう半分ではドローンで宿舎バルコニーを国別に写して回る。音楽はケージの4分33秒でコロナでなくなった方々と、「復興五輪」なんだから10年前の震災で亡くなった方々に黙祷を捧げる。後者に関しては、復興の現状を包み隠さず写す。</p>



<p>オリンピックの最中は、IOC貴族たちにカメラが密着。東京オリンピックとしてのアートタッチのドキュメンタリーを残す。</p>



<p>選手たちが一同に会すのはもちろん閉会式の最後までお預けです。残った人たちだけですが。残らなかった人たちは大スクリーンでバーチャル参加ですね。</p>



<p>最後の最後に誰か象徴的な人（誰が良いですかね）がオリンピック貴族たちを排除してアスリートたちが集まり、商業主義との決別を宣言<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2021/07/4810/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-4810" title="スポーツ団体の資金源がこのへんだから無理は重々承知ですが。">3</a>するとか。LAオリンピック以来ずっとではありますが、今回は特にこれだけ商業主義とアテンションエコノミーの暗黒を見せつけている<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2021/07/4810/#easy-footnote-bottom-4-4810" title="小山田圭吾問題とかのぶみ問題とか、アテンションを取れる人を選ぶという広告代理店的思考ですよね">4</a>オリンピックなのでちょっと妄想してみました。</p>The post <a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2021/07/4810/">あり得たもう一つのオリンピック開会式</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.sakimura.org">@_Nat Zone</a>.

<p>The WorkerServiceBus class implements the IHostedService  interface and uses the IServiceBusTopicSubscription interface to subscribe to an Azure Service Bus topic. The StartAsync method is used to register the subscription using the RegisterOnMessageHandlerAndReceiveMessages method.  The interface provides a start, and stop and a dispose. The Azure Service Bus class is controlled using this hosted service. If needed, a periodic task could be implemented to run health checks on the client or whatever.</p>


  public class WorkerServiceBus : IHostedService, IDisposable
{
	private readonly ILogger&lt;WorkerServiceBus&gt; _logger;
	private readonly IServiceBusConsumer _serviceBusConsumer;
	private readonly IServiceBusTopicSubscription _serviceBusTopicSubscription;

	public WorkerServiceBus(IServiceBusConsumer serviceBusConsumer,
		IServiceBusTopicSubscription serviceBusTopicSubscription,
		ILogger&lt;WorkerServiceBus&gt; logger)
	{
		_serviceBusConsumer = serviceBusConsumer;
		_serviceBusTopicSubscription = serviceBusTopicSubscription;
		_logger = logger;
	}

	public async Task StartAsync(CancellationToken stoppingToken)
	{
		_logger.LogDebug("Starting the service bus queue consumer and the subscription");
		await _serviceBusConsumer.RegisterOnMessageHandlerAndReceiveMessages().ConfigureAwait(false);
		await _serviceBusTopicSubscription.PrepareFiltersAndHandleMessages().ConfigureAwait(false);
	}

	public async Task StopAsync(CancellationToken stoppingToken)
	{
		_logger.LogDebug("Stopping the service bus queue consumer and the subscription");
		await _serviceBusConsumer.CloseQueueAsync().ConfigureAwait(false);
		await _serviceBusTopicSubscription.CloseSubscriptionAsync().ConfigureAwait(false);
	}

	public void Dispose()
	{
		Dispose(true);
		GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
	}

	protected virtual async void Dispose(bool disposing)
	{
		if (disposing)
		{
			await _serviceBusConsumer.DisposeAsync().ConfigureAwait(false);
			await _serviceBusTopicSubscription.DisposeAsync().ConfigureAwait(false);
		}
	}
}
  


<p>The IHostedService is added to the services in the ConfigureServices method. The AddHostedService is used to initialize this. Now the Azure Service bus subscription can be managed and consume messages from the topic subscription or a queue is used.</p>


  public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
	services.AddControllers();

	var connection = Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection");

	services.AddDbContext&lt;PayloadContext&gt;(options =&gt;
		options.UseSqlite(connection));

	services.AddSingleton&lt;IServiceBusConsumer, ServiceBusConsumer&gt;();
	services.AddSingleton&lt;IServiceBusTopicSubscription, ServiceBusTopicSubscription&gt;();
	services.AddSingleton&lt;IProcessData, ProcessData&gt;();

	services.AddHostedService&lt;WorkerServiceBus&gt;();

	services.AddSwaggerGen(c =&gt;
	{
		c.SwaggerDoc("v1", new OpenApiInfo
		{
			Version = "v1",
			Title = "Payload API",
		});
	});
}
  


<p>When the application is run, the messages can be sent to the topic and are received using the IHostedService Azure Service Bus subscription.</p>

‘hexadaisy layout’ by Darla available at <a href="https://flic.kr/p/e6MH6e">http://www.flickr.com/photos/pedrosz/2040577615</a> under a Attribution 2.0 Generic (CC BY 2.0)&nbsp;license<p>When Open Badges was kicking off ten years ago (<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/images/5/59/OpenBadges-Working-Paper_012312.pdf">see the original white paper</a>), it was conceived to be a recognition infrastructure for skills attained and achievements accomplished anywhere at any time. Badges could assert skills learned informally, formally, really in any aspect of and through life. It was hoped that recruiters, employers, and others could evaluate the badges to find people who had skills that aligned with the opportunities being offered. It was envisioned they could work like other types of credentials such as degrees and certifications, “but with room for much more granular or diverse skill representation” and available opportunities to capture these&nbsp;skills.</p><p>The infrastructure for this type of recognition system was a format called a digital badge. More than just a digital sticker, the badges would be filled with metadata properties describing the skills and achievements. Then the badges could convey the metadata both as human readable and machine readable content. By having a standard to describe the metadata and how it would be verified, Open Badges became usable in many technologies and contexts. For the most part, this resulted in badges being shared online on issuing platforms and social media — more as a tool for human understanding than one that took full advantage of the potential for machine readability.</p><p>Since then, the ethos of Open Badges, recognizing skills anywhere and anytime, has strengthened. Growth has accelerated, especially in the past few years. IMS Global and Credential Engine’s <a href="http://content.imsglobal.org/badge-count-2020/badge-count-2020/">Badge Count 2020 Report</a> indicated that there’d been an 80% increase in issued badges since 2018. Its use has expanded into more formal institutional contexts, the metadata have evolved, and initiatives have risen around it including the <a href="https://www.openrecognition.org/">Open Recognition Alliance</a>, <a href="https://www.thebadgesummit.com/">Badge Summit</a>, and the <a href="https://www.openskillsnetwork.org/">Open Skills&nbsp;Network</a>.</p><p>Over the years, internet technologies have evolved too and a credential verification model at the W3C called <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> has gained traction. This verification model can be used for any type of credential including passports, drivers licenses, and educational credentials like Open Badges. In fact, members of the Open Badges community helped to write the very first <a href="https://opencreds.org/specs/source/use-cases/">use cases</a> for Verifiable Credentials back in 2018. This was because we knew then that if Open Badges data were to be trusted by apps, they not only needed to be readable by machines, they needed to be verifiable.</p><p>The Verifiable Credential model can provide security and privacy enhancements not yet available to Open Badges. This model gives learners persistent access to their badges increasing the longevity and resilience of credentials that were intended to promote and support lifelong learning. A more secure and universally supported verification model such as Verifiable Credentials enables Open Badges to become the personal skills currency it was originally envisioned to&nbsp;be.</p><p><a href="https://concentricsky.com/">Concentric Sky</a> (<a href="https://info.badgr.com/">Badgr</a>) has offered a <a href="https://github.com/concentricsky/openbadges-specification/blob/feature/ob3/proposals/OBv3p0/Proposal-Open-Badges-3.0.pdf">proposal for a new version of Open Badges</a> that explains what is needed to make it work within the Verifiable Credentials model. The use cases in the proposal provide scenarios where Open Badges are earned and then how they are exchanged. In one use case, a medical professional is able to start her new job sooner because her CME’s can be quickly verified:</p><p>Verifying Continuing Ed: Denise was offered a new job at a hospital as a physician assistant. Before starting, her continuing education training and license to practice needed to be verified. The last time she switched hospitals, the verification process took three weeks. This time, she was able to provide her badges to prove her training and license. Within minutes her credentials were verified and she was issued a new digital staff credential</p><p>In another use case, a career change is facilitated by using verifiable Open Badges to map skills to&nbsp;jobs:</p><p>Mapping Skills: Sid is shifting careers after many years working in construction. In his digital wallet he had several skill badges describing his mastery of several skills in construction but also in teamwork, communication, and organizational skills. Sid also had badges from some courses he’d taken in science and math over the last few years. After he uploaded the skill and course badges from his wallet to a career planning site, he was offered several opportunities to apply for work in software sales and cybersecurity.</p><p>Here’s an example of how an Open Badge as a Verifiable Credential (Open Badges 3.0) exchange could&nbsp;work:</p>  A learner connects to a badge issuing platform with their digital wallet app on their phone or&nbsp;laptop.  Once authenticated, the issuer provides the badge to the learner who puts it in their wallet. The badge data contains cryptographic proof that identifies the issuer and the&nbsp;learner.  A job employment app asks for proof that the applicant has experience with a requirement needed for that&nbsp;role.  The learner presents the job employment app with the badge using the digital wallet app. The job employment app can then verify<br>a. that the learner providing the badge is the recipient of that badge<br>b. that the issuer is the identity that issued the badge, and<br>c. that the badge data has not changed since it was&nbsp;issued.  The verifier responds that the badge is authentic.  <p>In comparison, here’s an Open Badges 2.0&nbsp;flow:</p>  A learner or an organization provides an issuer app with the learner’s email&nbsp;address  The Issuer generates badge data that includes the email address as the recipient identity and sends the earner the badge (typically as a link to a web&nbsp;page)  The earner can share the link on social media, or perhaps with a potential employer or a job application app.  The badge is verified by either<br>a. a human looking at the web page where the badge is hosted or<br>b. the application attempts to retrieve the badge data from a url hosted by the&nbsp;issuer.  <p>The Open Badges 2.0 example depends on the issuer hosting the data and relies on an email address for the learner. The Open Badges 3.0 example is self-contained and doesn’t require the issuer to continue to retain a web hosting provider in order for the credential to remain valid. Instead it uses cryptographic proof to authenticate the badge, the issuer, as well as the learner who earned it. With either example, the learner has a way to proudly share their achievement online but the Open Badges 3.0 method doesn’t rely on that online presence for verification. In fact, the original issuer may no longer exist, but the achievements can still be verified.</p><p>On Monday July 19, we’ll be reviewing the <a href="https://github.com/concentricsky/openbadges-specification/blob/feature/ob3/proposals/OBv3p0/Proposal-Open-Badges-3.0.pdf">Open Badges 3.0 proposal</a> and anyone is invited to join us to learn more. Here’s the meeting&nbsp;info:</p><p>Monday, July 19, 2021<br>Time: 8am PDT / 11am EDT / 4pm BST, 5pm CEST<br>Jitsi Web Conference: <a href="https://meet.w3c-ccg.org/education">https://meet.w3c-ccg.org/education</a><br>US phone: tel:+1.602.932.2243;3</p><p>On Thursday, July 22, Concentric Sky will be presenting this proposal to the IMS Global Open Badges working group to seek the members’ go-ahead to move forward on the work to make Open Badges 3.0 a reality.

  <p>Summary:      The current model for connected things puts manufacturers inbetween people and their things. That model negatively affects personal freedom, privacy, and society. Alternate models can provide the same benefits of connected devices without the societal and personal costs.</p>



<p>
    In <a href="https://doctorow.medium.com/peloton-bricks-its-treadmills-dc033b74bece">Peloton Bricks Its Treadmills</a>, Cory Doctorow discusses Peloton's response to a product recall on its treadmills. Part of the response was a firmware upgrade. Rather than issuing the firmware upgrade to all treadmills, Peloton "bricked" all the treadmills and then only updated the ones where the owner was paying a monthly subscription for Peloton's service.
</p>

<p>
    When I talk about Internet of Things (IoT), I always make the point that the current architecture for IoT ensures that people are merely renting connected things, not owning them, despite paying hundreds, even thousands, of dollars upfront. Terms and conditions on accounts usually allow the manufacturer to close your account for any reason and without recourse. Since many products cannot function without their associated cloud service, this renders the device inoperable.
</p>

<p>
    I wrote about this problem in 2014, describing the current architecture as the CompuServe of Things. I wrote:
</p>

<blockquote>If Fitbit decides to revoke my account, I will probably survive. But what if, in some future world, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority">root certificate authority</a> of the identity documents I use for banking, shopping, travel, and a host of other things decides to revoke my identity for some reason? Or if my car stops running because Ford shuts off my account? People must have autonomy and be in control of the connected things in their life. There will be systems and services provided by others and they will, of necessity, be administered. But those administering authorities need not have control of people and their lives. We know how to solve this problem. Interoperability takes "intervening" out of "administrative authority." 
</blockquote>

<p>
    The architecture of the CompuServe of Things looks like this:
</p>


	<a></a>
	CompuServe of Things Architecture (click to enlarge)


<p>
    We're all familiar with it. Alice buys a new device, downloads the app for the device to her phone, sets up an account, and begins using the new thing. The app uses the account and the manufacturer-provided API to access data from the device and control it. Everything is inside the administrative control of the device manufacturer (indicated by the gray box).
</p>

<p>
    There is an alternative model:
</p>


	<a></a>
	Internet of Things Architecture (click to enlarge)


<p>
    In this model, the device and data about it are controlled by Alice, not the manufacturer. The device and an associated agent (pico) Alice uses to interact with it have a relationship with the manufacturer, but the manufacturer is no longer in control. Alice is in control of her device, the data is generates, and the agent that processes the data. Note that this doesn't mean Alice has to code or even manage all that. She can run her agent in an agency and the code in her agent is likely from the manufacturer. But it could be other code instead of or in addition to what she gets from the manufacturer. The point is that Alice can decide. A true <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/12/the_self-sovereign_internet_of_things.shtml">Internet of Things is self-sovereign</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Can this model work? Yes! We proved the model works for a production connected car platform called Fuse in 2013-2014. Fuse had hundreds of customers and over 1000 devices in the field. I <a href="https://www.windley.com/tags/fuse.shtml">wrote many articles about the experience, it's architecture, and advantages</a> on my blog.
</p>

<p>
    Fuse was built with picos. Picos are the actor-model programming system that we've developed over the last 12 years to build IoT products that respect individual autonomy and privacy while still providing all the benefits we've come to expect from our connected devices. I'll write more about picos as a programming model for reactive systems soon. Here's some related reading on my blog:

<p>
    Our current model for connected devices is in conflict, not only with our ability to functions as autonomous individuals, but also our vision for a well-functioning society. We can do better and we must. Alternate architectures can give us all the benefits of connected devices without the specter of Big Tech intermediating every aspect of our lives.

<p>It seems fitting that among old medical records I found this portrait of <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2017/04/26/where-the-nickname-came-from/">Doctor Dave</a>, my comic persona on radio and in print back in North Carolina, forty-five years ago. The artist is Alex Funk, whose nickname at the time was Czuko (pronounced “Chuck-o”). Alex is an artist, techie and (now literally) old friend of high excellence on all counts.</p>
<p>And, even though I no longer have much hair on my head, and appear to be in my second trimester, my wife and son just said “Oh yeah, that’s you” when I showed this to them. “Totally in character,” said my wife.</p>
<p>I guess so. As&nbsp;<a href="http://scripting.com">Dave</a> <a href="http://scripting.com/about">says (and does!)</a>, I’m still diggin’.</p>
<p>In the spirit of that, I thought this would be worth sharing with the rest of ya’ll.</p>

<p>In The Chess Master and the Computer, Garry Kasparov famously wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>The winner was revealed to be not a grandmaster with a state-of-the-art PC but a pair of amateur American chess players using three computers at the same time. Their skill at manipulating and “coaching” their computers to look very deeply into positions effectively counteracted the superior chess understanding of their grandmaster opponents and the greater computational power of other participants. Weak human + machine + better process was superior to a strong computer alone and, more remarkably, superior to a strong human + machine + inferior process.</p></blockquote>
<p>The title of his subsequent TED talk sums it up nicely: Don’t fear intelligent machines. Work with them.</p>
<p>That advice resonates powerfully as I begin a second work week augmented by GitHub Copilot, a coding assistant based on OpenAI’s Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT-3). Here is Copilot’s tagline: “Your AI pair programmer: get suggestions for whole lines or entire functions right inside your editor.” If you’re not a programmer, a good analogy is Gmail’s offer of suggestions to finish sentences you’ve begun to type.</p>
<p>In mainstream news the dominant stories are about copyright (“Copilot doesn’t respect software licenses”), security (“Copilot leaks passwords”), and quality (“Copilot suggests wrong solutions”). Tech Twitter amplifies these and adds early hot takes about dramatic Copilot successes and flops. As I follow these stories, I’m thinking of another. GPT-3 is an intelligent machine. How can we apply Kasparov’s advice to work effectively with it?</p>
<p>Were I still a tech journalist I’d be among the first wave of hot takes. Now I spend most days in Visual Studio Code, the environment in which Copilot runs, working most recently on analytics software. I don’t need to produce hot takes, I can just leave Copilot running and reflect on notable outcomes.</p>
<p>Here was the first notable outcome. In the middle of writing some code I needed to call a library function that prints a date. In this case the language context was Python, but might as easily have been JavaScript or SQL or shell. Could I memorize the date-formatting functions for all these contexts? Actually, yes, I believe that’s doable and might even be beneficial. But that’s a topic for another day. Let’s stipulate that we can remember a lot more than we think we can. We’ll still need to look up many things, and doing a lookup is a context-switching operation that often disrupts flow.</p>
<p>In this example I would have needed a broad search to recall the name of the date-formatting function that’s available in Python: strftime. Then I’d have needed to search more narrowly to find the recipe for printing a date object in a format like Mon Jan 01. A good place for that search to land is <a href="https://strftime.org/">https://strftime.org/</a>, where Will McCutchen has helpfully summarized several dozen directives that govern the strftime function.</p>
<p>Here’s the statement I needed to write:</p>
<p>day = day.strftime('%a %d %b')</p>
<p>Here’s where the needed directives appear in the documentation:</p>
<p></p>
<p>To prime Copilot I began with a comment:</p>
<p># format day as Mon Jun 15</p>
<p>Copilot suggested the exact strftime incantation I needed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is exactly the kind of example-driven assistance that I was hoping <a href="https://twitter.com/GitHubCopilot?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@githubcopilot</a> would provide. Life's too short to remember, or even look up, strptime and strftime.</p>
<p>(It turns out that June 15 was a Tuesday, that doesn't matter, Mon Jun 15 was just an example.) <a href="https://t.co/a1epnaZRF9">pic.twitter.com/a1epnaZRF9</a></p>
<p>— Jon Udell (@judell) <a href="https://twitter.com/judell/status/1412111420561367059?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 5, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Now it’s not hard to find a page like Will’s, and once you get there it’s not hard to pick out the needed directives. But when you’re in the flow of writing a function, avoiding that context switch doesn’t only save time. There is an even more profound benefit: it conserves attention and preserves flow.</p>
<p>The screencast embedded in the above tweet gives you a feel for the dynamic interaction. When I get as far as # format day as M, Copilot suggests MMDDYYY even before I write Mon, then adjusts as I do that. This tight feedback loop helps me explore the kinds of natural examples I can use to prime the system for the lookup.</p>
<p>For this particular pattern I’m not yet getting the same magical result in JavaScript, SQL, or shell contexts, but I expect that’ll change as Copilot watches me and others try the same example and arrive at the analogous solutions in these other languages.</p>
<p>I’m reminded of <a href="http://jonudell.net/udell/gems/delicious/delicious.html">Language evolution with del.icio.us</a>, from 2005, in which I explored the dynamics of the web’s original social bookmarking system. To associate a bookmarked resource with a shared concept you’d assign it a tag broadly used for that concept. Of course the tags we use for a given concept often vary. Your choice of cinema or movie or film was a way to influence the set of resources associated with your tag, and thus encourage others to use the same tag in the same way.</p>
<p>That kind of linguistic evolution hasn’t yet happened at large scale. I hope Copilot will become an environment in which it can. Intentional use of examples is one way to follow Kasparov’s advice for working well with intelligent systems.</p>
<p>Here’s a contrived Copilot session that suggests what I mean. The result I am looking for is the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].<br>
<code><br>
l1 = [1, 2, 3]<br>
l2 = [3, 4, 5]<br>
# merge the two lists<br>
l3 = l1 + l2 # no: [1, 2, 3, 3, 5]<br>
# combine as [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]<br>
l3 = l1 + l2 # no: [1, 2, 3, 3, 5]<br>
# deduplicate the two lists<br>
l1 = list(set(l1)) # no: [1, 2, 3]<br>
# uniquely combine the lists<br>
l3 = list(set(l1) | set(l2))  # yes: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]<br>
# merge and deduplicate the lists<br>
l3 = list(set(l1 + l2)) # yes: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]<br>
</code></p>
<p>The last two Copilot suggestions are correct; the final (and simplest) one would be my choice. If I contribute that choice to a public GitHub repository am I voting to reinforce an outcome that’s already popular? If I instead use the second comment (combine as [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) am I instead voting for a show-by-example approach (like Mon Jun 15) that isn’t yet as popular in this case but might become so? It’s hard for me — and likely even for Copilot itself — to know exactly how Copilot works. That’s going to be part of the challenge of working well with intelligent machines. Still, I hope for (and mostly expect) a fruitful partnership in which our descriptions of intent will influence the mechanical synthesis even as it influences our descriptions.</p>

 Core issue with crypto / stable-coins <p>The biggest unsolved issue with crypto&nbsp;is</p>  its abuse as facilitator of ransomeware / extortion — causing continuous tightening of regulations.  Pseudo-anonymous money laundering that causes traceable risks to Banks (unlike cash which is completely anonymous) — causing <a href="https://www.state.gov/de-risking/">“de-risking”</a> and therefore resulting in extreme and continuous friction for crypto to go mainstream.  <p>Due to the irreversible nature of crypto-currencies together with pseudo-anonymous traceability of dirty money, banks face unlimited risk in serving as on-ramps or off-ramps to&nbsp;crypto.</p> US-banking grade KYC at a global level is not possible with current technology   Identity document can be tampered or stolen — any document can be photoshopped. There is no global database of “photos/biometric” and therefore it is possible to create fake/stolen identities easily.  Impersonation checks don’t exist — There is a 15% error rate in verifying peoples faces with hi-resolution photos in passports by trained immigration professionals in a physical setting. Matching a digital photo with scanned ID by untrained staff or even AI is just no possible.  Address checks don’t exist — There is no global method to verify current address of a given person. Any utility bill can be photoshopped or&nbsp;stolen.  <p>Current Gold standard for digital on-boarding is bank verification by linking your account or verifying test-deposits of few cents in your bank but it only works domestically.</p>  The issue is that this kind of linking of accounts is not possible internationally over a swift&nbsp;network.  The alternative solutions like Plaid do not give global coverage and only work in core few developed countries.  <p>In current scenario— Banks in most countries like switzerland, singapore, UK etc require physical visits or otherwise extremely cumbersome Notary / appostille of documents to even open non-crypto accounts.</p> DIRO is a fundamental new technology <p>that eliminates these bottlenecks not just for crypto-currencies but horizontally for many traditional industries.</p>  Makes Global impersonation check possible — it is the first breakthrough technology that not only turns each and every institutional / government/ corporate website into an identity authenticator. This new technology extends the Gold standard (like Plaid) for US-banking grade identity verification at a global&nbsp;scale.  Makes Global address check possible — can verify any current utility bill from any country, any language, any company be it Telephone, Gas, Electricity, TV, Internet, Municipal taxes or&nbsp;even  100% global coverage — without the need for any third party cooperation/ APIs or agreements.  100% guaranteed — DIRO leverages the time tested and battle tested SSL/TLS technology and blockchain to generate mathematically provable and court-admissible evidence. The documents produced using DIRO are even stronger than physical originals.  <p>Privacy and data protection — The documents produced by DIRO are not only reportable and audit-able by third-parties and regulators but also provide decentralised verification on blockchain (without the typical “phone-home privacy problem”). The access to global private data behind login and passwords are accessed by the USER under is GDPR right to access his own data while automatically providing consent for verification to&nbsp;proceed.</p>

    What is NEW in this article about decision making? <p>The new part explains the relationship between choices, decisions and judgement and how our questions indicate if our relationship is curious and constructive OR linear, framed, and destructive.&nbsp; This article is part of a <a href="https://www.digital20.com/masterclass">masterclass</a> I have been creating on how we, as directors and those in leadership, can improve our choices, decisions and judgements using data and be better ancestors.&nbsp;</p><p>This article is not another self-help or “use this framework to improve decision making”; it is for the curious and those who ask questions on their journey. The refelction at the end should be "How does this article affect our views on the automation of decision making and the use of AI?"</p> Why is this an important topic? <p>Our individual and unique view of the world comprises layers of constructs created by our personality, biases, preferences, facts, and ideas learnt from past experiences.&nbsp; These constructs are better known as “mental models”, which frame how we individually make sense of or align to the world. We continually develop sense-making frameworks, models, and maps in our brains that frame what we perceive as reality, thus affecting our behaviour and, consequently, our Choices, decisions, and Judgments (CDJ).</p><p>Whilst we don’t like it, our mental model frames how we see the world.&nbsp; I love how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassie_Kozyrkov">Cassie Kozyrkov</a> (chief decision-maker at Google) describes in this <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/statistics-are-you-bayesian-or-frequentist-4943f953f21b">article</a> using the toss of a coin to determine how you see the world.&nbsp; Statistics predict one aspect of chance but not how you perceive the results when the coin has landed, and the outcome is known but not to you. My dad taught me to toss the coins a few more times until I got the result I wanted. It was a reinforcement model that I had made the right decision from the possible two choices.&nbsp; I would also suggest following and reading <a href="https://lisafeldmanbarrett.com/">Lisa Feldman Barrett</a> work, especially her new book “<a href="https://lisafeldmanbarrett.com/books/seven-and-a-half-lessons-about-the-brain/">seven and a half lessons about the brain</a>.” She says that we must grasp that everything we perceive as reality is, in fact, constructed from fragments, and we have no idea what reality really is.&nbsp; (yes, this is reinforcement bias - I am quoting things to frame you that align to my model)</p><p>In our digital era, new uncertainty, <a href="https://opengovernance.net/quantum-risk-a-wicked-problem-that-emerges-at-the-boundaries-of-our-data-dependency-2dc36dfb21fb">quantum risk</a>, and more ambiguity constantly challenge our <a href="https://opengovernance.net/what-occurs-when-physical-beings-transition-to-information-beings-146ea9dcbca3">mental models</a> and how we accommodate and make sense.&nbsp; The volume of <a href="https://opengovernance.net/the-shadowy-hierarch-5780154de92">noise and signals</a> coming into our brains is high, but we filter and convert it all into something that has meaning to each of us according to our own unique mental model.&nbsp; We all reach different interpretations about what is happening, which creates frustration, confusion and misalignment. We use questions to clarify and check our understanding, assumptions and quality of information. Slight differences always remain; the unsaid, mislead, guided, incentivised, and overconfidence, unfortunately, takes us from the simple to correct misalignments; to tension, conflict and entrenchment.</p><p>This topic matters as directors are mandated to make decisions, but we find we are operating with misalignments, tensions, compromises, and outright conflict.&nbsp; This happens as the <a href="https://opengovernance.net/power-agency-and-influence-a-new-framework-about-complex-relationships-73f5e97295ef">individuals sitting at the same table have agency</a> (and their own mental models and incentives). We are unsure if we have the right choices or are clear about our judgment’s unintended consequences or long-term impact. We have to talk about it.&nbsp;</p><p>We should unpack our relationship with choice, decision and judgement as mental models, hierarchy and rules constrain us. This article is not about “how to ask better questions”, nor if you should (as some questions we don’t want the answer to), but how to determine if you, your team or your company has a constructive or destructive relationship with CDJ.&nbsp;</p><p>---</p><p>When talking about CDJ, you would imagine that in 2021 that starting from the definitions should help, but it does not, as there is a recursive loop of using one definition to define the other words, which define themselves.&nbsp; Amazingly there are professional bodies for <a href="https://www.decisionprofessionals.com/">decision making</a> and <a href="http://www.sjdm.org/">judgement</a>; alas, even these cannot agree on how to define or clearly demark between intent and actions. Our base problem is that:&nbsp; everything framed with a maths or data mind: is a decision. Everything is a choice when framed by a psychologist or social scientist. To someone who has authority and responsibility or plays with complexity, everything looks like a judgment.&nbsp; Confusingly everything is an opinion to a judge!</p><br><p>Everything framed with a maths or data mind: is a decision. Everything is a choice when framed by a psychologist or social scientist. To someone who has authority and responsibility or plays with complexity, everything looks like a judgment.&nbsp; Confusingly everything is an opinion to a judge!</p><br><p>Here are the definitions from the Collins and Oxford dictionaries&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Choice &nbsp;[countable noun] If there is a choice of things, there are several of them, and you can choose the one you want.&nbsp; [countable noun] Your choice is someone or something that you choose from a range of things. <a href="https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/choice">Collins </a>&nbsp;OR &nbsp;[countable] an act of choosing between two or more possibilities; something that you can choose&nbsp; [uncountable] the right to choose; the possibility of choosing <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/choice_1?q=choice">Oxford Dictionary</a></p><p>Decisions&nbsp; [countable noun] When you make a decision, you choose what should be done or which is the best of various possible actions.&nbsp; [uncountable noun] Decision is the act of deciding something or the need to decide something <a href="https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/decision">Collins </a>&nbsp;OR &nbsp;[countable] a choice or judgement that you make after thinking and talking about what is the best thing to do&nbsp; [uncountable] the process of deciding something <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/decision?q=decision">Oxford Dictionary</a></p><p>Judgment [uncountable noun] is the ability to make sensible guesses about a situation or sensible decisions about what to do.&nbsp; [variable noun] A judgment is an opinion that you have or express after thinking carefully about something&nbsp; <a href="https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/judgment">Collins </a>&nbsp;OR &nbsp;[uncountable] the ability to make sensible decisions after carefully considering the best thing to do; [countable, uncountable] an opinion that you form about something after thinking about it carefully; the act of making this opinion known to others <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/judgement?q=judgment">Oxford Dictionary</a></p><br><p><br></p><p>Therefore, a judgment is the ability to make a sensible decision about a choice, which requires judgment about which choices to pick. As Yoda would say, “wise decision you make, stupid choices your judgement however selected.”</p> The timeless challenges of Choices, Decisions and Judgment (CDJ) <p>“I change my mind as the data changes” is a modern digital age sentiment from the economist John Maynard Keynes who is quoted to have said, "When the facts change, I change my mind." It was likely adapted from an early human bias where leadership in war and battles refused to change their mind even when the facts were in, and they had been proven wrong.&nbsp;</p><p>Choices, decisions and judgement are not difficult if you relinquish your values, ethics and blindly follow the incentives or can fully appreciate the impact of your actions. Still, we know it is just not that simple. We have heuristics to remove choice rather than create more and ways to find more data and facts to become more informed, but without knowing if the new data is helpful or not.&nbsp; Ultimately, at some point, you have to make a choice, decision or judgement.&nbsp;</p><p>The diagram below represents some of the timeless challenges of CDJ, which is a balance between what we know and don’t know.&nbsp; We have the experience that creates the ghosts of the past, flighting the voices of the present as we try to decide what the spirits of the future hold, whilst being held accountable for the decisions we make.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>The point here is that it is always possible to find a reason why to act or not to act and the timeless challenge remains that there is no perfect choice, decision or judgment.&nbsp; However, over time and because we have choices we can make decisions that improve our judgement which means we can find and select the right choices.&nbsp; This is a constructive relationship between CDJ.&nbsp; A destructive relationship would be to not like the choices we face, procrastinate in the hope a better choice occurs or maybe lose a choice where the decision is made for you. You don’t improve your judgment and so you cannot determine if the next choice is any better - it is linear.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Is the CDJ relationship about framing? <p>From the definition section at the beginning of this article, it was evident that there is a high degree of overlap and dependency between choice, decision and judgment.&nbsp; As highlighted in the previous section it can become complex very quickly but our brain (mental models) demand patterns to make sense of it and so we tend to come back to simple linear narratives which do not do them (choice, decisions, judgment) justice. What we have realised but tend not to verbalise is that none of our (mental) models or frameworks work in all cases and indeed all models about choice, decision and judgment fail.&nbsp; This is why there is always a new book on the topic with new self-help content that you have not seen before, and we cling to a hope that the next model will work better - alas they don’t. I am aware of over 100 decision support models and I expect I have not really scratched the surface. &nbsp; An example below puts choice, decision and judgment on a continuum between your own north star and that for a shared tribe, community or society.&nbsp; It does not really work.&nbsp; White flag time.&nbsp;</p><p>What we have realised but tend not to verbalise is that none of our (mental) models or frameworks work in all cases and indeed all models about choice, decision and judgment fail.</p><br><p></p><p>#Lockdowns have enabled many social experiments.&nbsp; One has been about choice and buying behaviour.&nbsp; As we moved our shopping for food online and therefore missed the in store sale specials, end of gondea, carefully placed items next to each other, those large piled up offers in the entrance and the sweets at the exit, our patterns have changed as choice became limited.&nbsp; We became creatures of habit, buying largely the same items, which reduce in variance over time.&nbsp; (This also highlights that the UI and UX for shopping sucks.)&nbsp; The decision to shop was removed from us, and our choices fell, but the variety was still there.&nbsp; So much for the Web creating perfect information or the algorithm knowing what you would want.&nbsp;</p><p>As an alternative, we can determine that CDJ will change depending on the context right now and the perception those facing the issue have.&nbsp; The figure below highlights three examples but what we rapidly conclude is that complexity in CDJ is generated by speed, volume, consequences, data, sense of enquiry, situation and our own mental models. Every known variable adds layers.</p><p></p><br> Where are we up to and where next? <p>So far, we have explored that there is a relationship between choices, decisions and judgements. We, however, tend to focus on one of them (decision making) as it looks the most difficult, and the others are just linkages. However, this preference for “decision making” fails to understand if we are using the right word to describe the action we are taking. There is no doubt that the word decision is preferable as it is perceived as more powerful and important than choice or judgment. The relationship between them is causal, complex and relational, and we are framed, educated and incentivised to the simple linear view and a single narrative. The reality is that judgement helps frame our choices which we decide on that improve our judgment skills — they are not linear; they are circular. They are circular as we all have agency.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;The reality is that judgement helps frame our choices, which we decide on, that improve our judgment skills</p><p></p><p>We know the linear models are broken as there is no universal tool to help with choice, decision and judgement.&nbsp; The next part is to explain the relationship we have between choices, decisions and judgement and how our questions indicate if it is constructive and curious OR linear, framed and destructive.</p><p>We tend to focus on the decision and choice axis. If we can eliminate bad choices we can improve decisions, but ignore the fact that it is judgment skills that help find the right choice. Procrastination as a decision tool is framed that time will remove choice and so a decision becomes easier, either because a choice has been removed or more data supports one option. More data does not make decision-making easier; nor does it guarantee to make it better.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Worthy of note is that academic work about “decision-making” will always seek to create the most complex solution because academics are incentivised to use the most advanced and new thinking (publication, referencing, research and reputation). Sometimes tossing a coin is the perfect solution. &nbsp; The more we see the complex, the less we will accept the simple.&nbsp; In a linear world where we view choice, decision and judgment as a progression line, where we are given choices when young and make a judgement when we are old and wise ignore that we learn and need to exercise all three all the time to become more proficient at decision making.&nbsp; Decision making is not a task or an end game.&nbsp;</p><p>As a thought experiment: if you had all the <a href="https://opengovernance.net/data-for-better-decisions-nature-or-nurture-79e6531dbe3a">data</a> in the world and all the compute power possible to run a perfect forecast model, would you need to make further choices, decisions or judgments?&nbsp; To reach your view I assume you have decided to either give each human full <a href="https://opengovernance.net/power-agency-and-influence-a-new-framework-about-complex-relationships-73f5e97295ef">agency</a> or you have taken our individual <a href="https://opengovernance.net/power-agency-and-influence-a-new-framework-about-complex-relationships-73f5e97295ef">agency</a> away.&nbsp; Now in my definition of data, which might be different to yours, how we all behave with our agency is just data, which opens up a can of worms for each of us. Can you have full agency (freewill) and it all still be modelled? What do we mean about behavioural modelling, agency, data and even more precisely <a href="https://medium.com/mydata/data-is-data-e2a877cb206b">all data</a>?</p><p>Getting to one data set, one tool, one choice hides layers of complexity which looks good for one better decision but is unlikely to be a long term solution to improving choices, decisions and judgment.&nbsp; You have/had choice, you make/made decisions, you exhibit/exercise judgment.&nbsp; Judgement supports you in finding choices.&nbsp;</p> How the questions we ask inform us!&nbsp; <p>The questions you are currently asking will help inform you where you are in the cycle, indeed if you already have closed the loop and have a constructive cycle or a linear open loop distructure relationship with choice, decisions and judgment.&nbsp;</p><p>The circular framing means depending on the stage we are in a process we will be asking different questions.&nbsp; Given that a board has to deal with many situations all at different stages at every meeting, we should see all these questions asked at every meeting, just framed to different agenda items.&nbsp; If there is no variation in questions,&nbsp; surely it tells us something.&nbsp; Indeed are we using our improvement at each stage to further improve the next outcome.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>The destructive “cycle” is not circular but is a linear model as it is fundamentally disconnected from a learning based idea using choice and judgement and focussed on Better Decision making. It depends on the idea that by reading a new book or going on a new decision making course that we will get better.&nbsp; The iteration of improvement is an external influence.&nbsp; Perhaps it is mentoring or coaching and they (mentors) keep you from closing the loop as they either don’t know or it would not support their business model. Indeed books, education and courses have no interest in you closing the loop and always making you believe in a new tool, method, process - it is their business model!</p><p></p><p>In the boardroom or in the senior management meetings is someone always asking the same questions?&nbsp; Does the agenda mean that as a team individuals are unable to ask different questions or is it that others are influencing the agenda to keep it framed to the decisions and outcomes they want.&nbsp; Why enable the asking for more data when the choice they want you to decide on and agree with is already the best supported case (<a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo/the-railroad-of-no-choice-a55420cea06f">railroaded</a>).&nbsp; Do you have observers or assessors who look at the questions you ask as a team and determine if you are asking the right questions? (something I am learning to do)&nbsp; Can skills in choice, decision and judgment be determined by the questions asked in the meetings? (something I am exploring)</p><p>A key question I often come back to when thinking about choice, decisions and judgment is “What are we optimising for?” I find the model below a helpful guide to understand the framing.&nbsp; In a linear model it would present moving from single choice in the lower left to complex judgment in the top right. In a learning cyclic model, choice, decision and judgement equally applies, however the lower left is a better learning and experience gaining context for mentoring, or succession planning, than the top right.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Why does this matter, because right now we have increasing data along with more vulnerabilities, ambiguity, complexity and uncertainty. The volume of moving variables (change) and the rate of change breaks the linear model as you can never match the model at hand to the situation you face.&nbsp; There is a need to move from linear ideas of choice, decisions and judgment to a circular one.&nbsp; Linear thinking is the best model when there are limited options and there is stability.&nbsp; We now have many options, increasing variables and more instability.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As your <a href="https://opengovernance.net/what-99-of-the-public-and-95-of-venture-and-investment-capital-have-got-wrong-69239b4da4f1">company is owned by no-one</a> (yes you read that right - follow this <a href="https://opengovernance.net/what-99-of-the-public-and-95-of-venture-and-investment-capital-have-got-wrong-69239b4da4f1">link</a> if you need to read more on this, a company owns itself) and a company cannot think for itself and therefore we (the directors) have to do the thinking for it.&nbsp; We are given in law the authority and responsibility to act on behalf of the company.&nbsp; This is “fiduciary duty”.&nbsp; It is the reason why directors need to move from a linear perspective of decision making to a circular improvement learning process of choice, decision making and judgement.</p><p>My proposal to help support better governance is that we request companies publish the questions asked in a board meeting. Not the answers, but definitely the questions.</p><br>

          <p>In those first 100 days, it will become evident if you are about to be railroaded or if you have to present the choice without creating railroading for those data laggards. The latter being the job, the former being a problem.</p>      <p>To be clear, railroaded means in this context:</p>  to force&nbsp;something&nbsp;to be officially approved or accepted without much discussion or thought.  to force&nbsp;someone&nbsp;into doing something quickly, usually without enough information.  <p>As the CDO, are you about to find that the tracks have already been laid and that you on the train and it is going in one direction. You are now the figurehead of the new shinny data plan based on already accepted wisdom. Your hope, before starting the role, is that it is more analogous to a personal transport situation. This would be where you get to pick the fuel (food, combustible), vehicle (walk, run, bike, motorcycle, car, van, lorry, aeroplane, boat), the destination and the route. Using the analogy of the train on the tracks, the decision to create a data-led organisation, the ontology, the data we have and the value we will create has been made irrespective of what you come up with, or what the data might be able to tell you. The processes are in place, and your role is not to craft, invest, create or imagine but to follow the tracks of command and control. It is at that moment that you realise just how good the CEO is at sales.</p><p>In this case, your priorities are: How to find the right tools that align or match what you are faced with? And, how do you take a senior leadership team and fellow directors on a journey to discover that they can change the rails, change the vehicle and be open to changing how we see the journey from A to B? Indeed based on a pandemic, do we need to physically move at all?</p><p>When the “railroaded” is you and you are being asked to approve something when you have not had the time or opportunity to gather the data or understand the processes, what are the right words to create time to explore and not appear indecisive, trying to procrastinate or evasive?</p><blockquote><p>what are the right words to create time to explore so as not to appear indecisive, trying to procrastinate or evasive?</p></blockquote><p>Presenting an argument about why you need more time is likely to fail, as the defensive response will always be “we have already done the work but it is your decision — trust us” Asking questions that check that the choices and opinions are the right ones or to determine the consequences will equally draw you into an argument where “the facts are the facts,” you have to decide or do you not trust us?</p><p>One question that will give some breathing space is “For what are we optimising,” as explored below.</p>          <p>The two-axis on the model set the horizontal scale of the short and long term against the vertical axis how many variables, from one to many. In asking the question “for what are we optimising,” you are not presenting this framework, but use the question to understand what the “railroading” is trying to achieve; through understanding what the decision being expected is optimising for. With this knowledge, you may find it is easier to take the railroaded decision. If you can conclude they are optimising for many externalities and long term, you are immersed in a team that can cope and manage complexity- this is going to be fun. If this is short term and a single variable you know that incentives are the significant driver and slowly changing the incentives will create a better place for making more complex data decisions. One scenario is outside of this framing which is that they actually don’t know what they are optimising for and the decision at hand is just another reaction to previous poor railroaded decisions. Definitely a red flag moment.</p> Note to the CEO <p>Using railroading as an activity to discover an individuals capability and backbone is always likely to go wrong. In this data-driven complex world where both the data and the analysis is a long way from your immediate access, you may also feel you are being railroaded by the signals and noise. It is likely you will ask “is this recommendation optimising for xyz (the plan you have agreed to) and how can you show this is the optimal path&nbsp;without&nbsp;using the same data” Love the misattributed quote that Ronald Reagan stole from the Russians but so can we.&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust,_but_verify">Trust, but verify.</a></p>

<p>Today I finished up a tool that you can use to export your complete history from Foursquare and publish the checkins to your website!</p>

<p>In 2017, I created <a href="https://ownyourswarm.p3k.io">OwnYourSwarm</a> to export my future Swarm checkins to my website in real-time. It's been working great, and it's meant that I have had a complete archive of all my checkins on my website ever since then, so I don't have to worry if Foursquare disappears one day. However, I never got around to creating a way to export my past checkins, so I was always missing my checkin history from 2009-2016.</p>

<p>I had been considering building this as a feature of OwnYourSwarm, but realized that it would end up taking a lot of additional effort to make it work well as a web service, in addition to dealing with possible rate limit issues with the Foursquare API. So instead, this is published as a downloadable script you can run on your own computer. This also means you have a bit more flexibility in how you can use it, as well as being able to customize it more if you choose.</p>

<p>You can download the code from GitHub here:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/aaronpk/Swarm-Checkins-Import">https://github.com/aaronpk/Swarm-Checkins-Import</a></p>

<p>The readme has installation and usage instructions, so I'll refrain from repeating all that in this post. Make sure to check out the step by step tutorial in the readme if you want to use this with your own account.</p>

<p>The process is broken up into a couple steps.</p>

 
 First, it downloads your entire Foursquare checkin history to JSON files on your computer 
 Second, it downloads all the photos from your checkins 
 Third, it publishes each checkin to your website via <a href="https://micropub.net">Micropub</a> 
 

<p>If your website doesn't support checkins via Micropub, or if you don't want your checkins on your website at all, you can just skip that step entirely, and instead you'll have a complete export of your data locally.</p>

<p>The JSON files contain the raw API response from Foursquare, so you can do what you want with that as well, such as turning it into your own HTML archive using your own custom tools if you want.</p>

<p>The one issue that I don't have a good solution for is handling renamed venues. Unfortunately the API returns the current name for old checkins, so if a venue is renamed, your old checkins will not reflect the name at the time of the checkin. This is particularly strange for businesses that have gone through an acquisition or rebranding, since for example all my old checkins in Green Dragon are now labeled as Rogue Eastside Brewery. As far as I can tell there isn't a good way to handle this, so I may have to go back and manually edit the posts on my website for the venues I know have been renamed.</p>

<p>I hope this is useful to people! I will be sleeping a little easier now knowing that my old checkin history is safely archived on my website now!</p>

In the interim, we have developed a number of improvements and features to the Mobile Wallet to support advanced capabilities such&nbsp;as:</p>  Authenticating to Identity Providers over OpenID Connect to receive credentials via OIDC&nbsp;Bridge  Deriving privacy-preserving selective disclosure presentations from credentials using BBS+ signatures  Establishing a secure DID messaging inbox for users to receive encrypted messages and push notifications  <p>These changes have not only made the wallet more functional; they’ve also evolved to better protect users’ best interests — giving them privacy-by-design and surfacing the information and context that they need to confidently make decisions underpinned by the security of decentralized identity.</p>Timeline of MATTR wallet development<p>This journey has led us to realize the importance of creating a wallet experience that places users front and center. As these systems create more opportunity for user-driven consent and identity management, they’ve simultaneously created a demand for a wallet that can not only perform the technical operations required, but do so in a user-friendly way that surfaces the information that truly matters to people. Our latest feature release to the MATTR Mobile Wallet is a step in this direction.</p><p>With Human-Friendly Credentials, we have added the capability to render different kinds of credentials uniquely in the wallet interface according to the information they contain. Until now, the end user experience for verifiable credentials has been largely consistent across different categories of credentials and issuers. In other words, a credential containing medical data from your doctor looks exactly the same as an education credential from your university or a concert ticket from a music venue: they all appear to the user as a long list of&nbsp;claims.</p><p>In this release we change that. Thanks to the semantic information encoded in verifiable credentials, the wallet is now able to understand and interpret certain kinds of credentials to render them to the user in a way that makes the data easier to understand.</p><p><a href="https://learn.mattr.global/concepts/semantic-web#json-ld">JSON-LD</a> verifiable credentials have the ability to support common data vocabularies and schemas which are published on the web. For example, if a credential contains a claim describing the name of an individual, the claim can be defined via reference to an existing data vocabulary found here: <a href="https://schema.org/Person">https://schema.org/Person</a></p><p>Human-Friendly Credentials allow the wallet to start intelligently displaying known credential types and data types. This shows up in a variety of different ways in a user’s&nbsp;dataset.</p><p>For example, this update formats address fields to make them more readable; formats names and proper nouns where possible; makes URLs, telephone numbers and email addresses clickable; highlights images and icons for better trust and brand signaling; and creates basic rules for language localization that adjust to a user’s device settings. This logic allows the wallet to create a kind of information hierarchy that starts to draw out the important aspects of data included in a credential, so users can make trust-based decisions using this information.</p><p>These rules are applied to any kind of credential the wallet encounters. Whilst all of this is incredibly helpful for users, we have gone a step further: displaying entire credentials in a completely unique UI according to their type. The ‘type’ property of a credential expresses what kind of information is in the credential — is it a degree, a medical record, a utility bill? The usage of common credential types across different implementations and ecosystems is necessary for semantic interoperability on the broader scale. The wallet should be able to recognize these common credential types and display them to the user in a friendly&nbsp;way.</p><p>In this update, we have added custom rendering for both Personal Identity Credentials as well as Education Courses. These are common types we see occurring naturally across the decentralized identity landscape, and now the MATTR Mobile Wallet is able to recognize and display them properly.</p>Personal Identity Credentials and Education Course credentials<p>An important note to consider is that Human-Friendly Credentials only work for known data and credential types. As the ecosystem matures, we expect to add more data types and credential types in the future to support an even broader set of human-related processes and actions. In a general sense, we will also continue to iterate on our digital wallet offerings to provide a greater degree of flexibility and control for end users. We believe it’s a vital component to a healthy digital trust ecosystem.</p><p>To check out these changes yourself, download the latest version of our <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/onboarding/install/wallet">Mobile Wallet</a> to get&nbsp;started.</p><p>For more information on Human-Friendly Credentials, check out our tutorials and video content on MATTR&nbsp;Learn.</p><p>For everything else related to MATTR, visit <a href="https://mattr.global">https://mattr.global</a> or follow <a href="https://twitter.com/mattrglobal">@MattrGlobal on&nbsp;Twitter</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/rendering-credentials-in-a-human-friendly-way-e47f4a32fd4b">Rendering credentials in a human-friendly way</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  A Sovereign Nation is only capable of two structural models of participation; <br>  1. Database model - data plantation based on possession of ID assets structured as liabilities&nbsp;  <br>  2. Self-Sovereign model - root authority at edges, admin verification mechanism at center.  <br>  In order for #2 to live in the world, a recursive signatory from one generation to the next authenticating the structural model of participation and Rights is required.&nbsp;  <br>  In America, John Hancock serves as our muse when considering the structure of Sovereign authority and the ID/signatory of participation within civil Society. The source of authority demonstrated by John Hancock and his peers in signing the "Declaration of Independence" had a personal origin. These people all put their personal lives, security, fortunes and reputations on the line, literally, and there was no authentication system in place when they did so. In essence, they used a personal relationship network to validate their own personal <a href="https://www.moxytongue.com/2012/02/what-is-sovereign-source-authority.html">Sovereign source authority</a> to declare anything meaningful in nascent Sovereign Terms.  <br>  You, as an American citizen, are no less than these people. Unless, of course, you Agree to participate in an ID/signatory based system of Rights without holding the system accountable to enforce your own participatory authority.  <br>  American Rights do not resolve from a database or State Trust storing birth certificates. American Rights are for, by, of people, not birth certificates. Of course, in administrative practice, try exercising your personal Rights without these administrative documents, including passports, driver's licenses, social security numbers, etc... which all originate and resolve to an administrative source of authority.  <br>  If you are provisioned authority to act as an American citizen, are you actually an American? Structure yields results in such concerns, and every person who has ever started a corporation and taken responsibility to protect the "corporate veil" from being compromised understands the importance of structural integrity. Unfortunately, the average American citizen does not, and the process of demonstrating America's model of authority is not something that is taught in public schools, funded by American tax payers.  <br>  American authority originates in people, Individuals all. This is not an optional requirement. Any other structural model is literally "un-American", and out of step with Constitutional integrity. Do law schools understand this?  <br>  A recursive signatory serves as the foundation of American ID within all Government-supported administration methods, such that the originating act of "Declaring Independence" is conveyed to every person, every Individual citizen, in the same manner as the founders demonstrated personally.  <br>  The founders of America did not demonstrate one model of American Sovereignty, and then convey a data plantation to everyone else to comply with. Instead, one generation after the next is required to protect the very Institution derived "of, by, for" people, Individuals all, by way of the structural process of inaugurating authentic participation.  <br>  Americans give their personal authority to their Governance. Americans do not receive their authority from their Government. The American people are not the dog of their government, because structurally, the Government is guaranteed to operate as the best friend of the people, Individuals all. This structural process, putting the authority of people before the authority of a bureaucratic Institution is the literal structural integrity differentiating THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA from every other Nation on Earth.  <br>  Generation after generation since America's founding has had their personal Sovereign source authority squandered and mis-represented by an "error of omission" from the structural process of forming an identity with recursive signatory integrity in the administration of American Rights.  <br>  This order of operations failure, putting a false model of <a href="https://www.moxytongue.com/2013/01/administrative-precedence.html">administrative precedence</a> within a database, is of utmost importance to how American Rights are administered. Without an accurate administrative precedence belonging to people, Individuals all, the Government becomes the keeper of people, rather than people being the keeper of their Governance.  <br>  For some reason, this is not obvious. For some reason, lawyers get this wrong constantly. The concept of a recursive signatory tied to Rights administration exceeds the intellectual grasp of legal managers living on the data plantation they have derived their administrative methods from. This must be repaired, for a Government derived "of, by, for" people, Individuals All.. can not exist otherwise.  <br>  America can not exist in practice without a recursive signatory event tied to Rights administration for every American citizen, giving form and function to the self-Sovereign method of Rights administration that gave life to America, and sustains it to this day.

<p>I recently came out as nonbinary trans-femme.
That's a picture of me on the left, with my spouse Morgan Lemmer-Webber
on the right.</p>
<p>In a sense, not much has changed, and so much has changed.
I've dropped the "-topher" from my name, and given the common tendency
to apply gender to pronouns in English, please either use nonbinary
pronouns or feminine pronouns to apply to me.
Other changes are happening as I wander through this space, from
appearance to other things.
(Probably the biggest change is finally achieving something resembling
self-acceptance, however.)</p>
<p>If you want to know more,
<a href="https://fossandcrafts.org/episodes/30-gender-sexuality-personal-perspective.html">Morgan and I did a podcast episode</a>
which explains more from my present standing, and also explains Morgan's
experiences with being demisexual, which not many people know about!
(Morgan has been incredible through this whole process, by the way.)</p>
<p>But things may change further.
Maybe a year from now those changes may be even more drastic, or maybe
not.
We'll see.
I am wandering, and I don't know where I will land, but it won't be
back to where I was.</p>
<p>At any rate, I've spent much of my life not being able to stand myself
for how I look and feel.
For most of my life, I have not been able to look at myself in a mirror
for more than a second or two due to the revulsion I felt at the person
I saw staring back at me.
The last few weeks have been a shift change for me in that regard...
it's a very new experience to feel so happy with myself.</p>
<p>I'm only at the beginning of this journey.
I'd appreciate your support... people have been incredibly kind to me
by and large so far but like everyone who goes through a process like this,
it's very hard in those experiences where people aren't.
Thank you to everyone who has been there for me so far.</p>

  <p>Summary:      Ever since the Covid pandemic started in 2020, various groups have seen verifiable credentials as a means for providing a secure, privacy-respecting system for health and travel data sharing. This post explores the ecosystem of ecosystems that is emerging as hundreds of organizations around the world rise to the challenge of implementing a globally interoperable system that also respects individual choice and privacy.</p>




<p>
    In The <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/04/the_politics_of_vaccination_passports.shtml">Politics of Vaccination Passports</a>, I wrote about the controversy surrounding proposals to require people to show proof of vaccination to travel–specifically fly. The worry is that once we get used to presenting a heath credential to travel, for example, it could quickly spread. Presenting an ID of some kind could become the default–with bars, restaurants, churches, stores, and every other public place saying "papers, please!" before allowing entry.
</p>

<p>
    My personal take is that while I'd rather avoid that scenario, it is likely inevitable. And if that's true, I'd love to have it designed in a way that respects individual choice and personal privacy as much as possible. This is a tall order because getting the tech right is only the first step on a long road. The air travel industry is global, gargantuan, and incredibly decentralized. Building an interoperable system of travel passes requires not just an ecosystem, but an ecosystem of ecosystems.
</p>

<p>
    Suppose Alice lives in <a href="https://designated-survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Naruba">Naruba</a> and has been vaccinated against Covid. The local hospital where she was vaccinated has issued a credential to Alice with the data about her doses, the dates, vaccine batch numbers, and so on. Alice is traveling on business to the <a href="https://designated-survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Kunami">Emirate of Kunami</a> which requires proof of vaccination. To fly, Alice must present a health pass to the gate agent who works for Kunami Air in the Soji airport. How does Kunami Air know they can trust a credential issued by a hospital they've never heard located in another country?
</p>

<p>
    Building a global, interoperable health and travel pass network requires both technology and governance. This sort of situation isn't new. In fact, if we replaced "proof of vaccination" with "airline ticket" in the preceding scenario, we wouldn't think anything of it. Different companies from different countries have been figuring out how to interoperate and trust the results for decades, maybe centuries.
</p>

<p>
    But doing that digitally, and quickly, is a big job with lots of moving parts. Below I take a look at a few of those parts and how they come together to solve the problem.
</p>

<a></a>
 Good Health Pass Collaborative 

<p>
    The <a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org/">Good Health Pass Collaborative (GHPC)</a> is an "open, inclusive, cross-sector initiative" of dozens of companies from the travel, health, and technology industries that is defining the blueprint for health and travel passes that are privacy-protecting, user-controlled, equitable, globally interoperable, and universally-accepted by international travel.
</p>

<p>
    GHPC is very specific about what a "pass" is:
</p>

<blockquote>
    A credential to which data minimization and anti-correlation have been applied and any relevant travel data has been added so it includes only what a verifier needs to make a trust decision in a specific context (such as boarding a plane).
</blockquote>

<p>
    A credential could have lots of health and travel data. The pass contains just the data needed for a specific context.
</p>

<p>
    <a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org/resources/">GHPC published a set of ten principles</a> in February to guide their work. These principles lay out a path that is consistent with self-sovereignty, respects individual autonomy, and promotes good privacy practices.
</p>

<p>
    In June, GHPC published a blueprint that provides recommendations for building a good health pass. The challenge of meeting the principles, while exchanging health data across different industry sectors can be overwhelming. The blueprint provides specific guidance on how to meet this challenge without sacrificing the principles that make a health pass "good." The recommendations include designs for trust registries and frameworks, data and protocol standards, and other components for the global interoperability of COVID certificate ecosystems.
</p>

<p>
    These efforts say what a good health pass is and give guidance for creating a credential ecosystem, but they don't create any such ecosystems. That's a job for other organizations.
</p>

<a></a>
 The Global COVID Certificate Network 

<p>
    The GHCP Blueprint provides recommendations about trust registries and frameworks, data and protocol standards, and other requirements to create global, interoperability ecosystems for COVID certificates. The <a href="https://www.lfph.io/2021/06/08/gccn/">Linux Foundation's Global COVID Certificate Network (GCCN)</a> "operationalizes and adapts the GHCP Blueprint recommendations for governments and industry alliances who are working to reopen borders." You can think of GCCN as an instantiation of the GHPC Blueprint.
</p>

<p>
    Going back to our traveler, Alice, we can imagine that Naruba and Kunami both have national health systems that can follow the blueprint from GHCP. When Alice uses her health pass inside Naruba, it is reasonable to expect that Narubian businesses will know what a real Narubian health pass looks like and whether to trust it or not. To make this possible, the Narubian health ministry would determine what data a legitimate pass contains (e.g. its schema) and what forms it takes such as the paper design and digital format. The ministry could also determine who in Naruba can issue these health passes and even set up a registry so others in Naruba can find out as well.
</p>

<p>
    This kind of one-size-fits-all, single-source solution can solve the local problem, but when Alice is interacting with people and organizations outside Naruba, the problem is much harder:
</p>

 
     Naruba and Kunami may have adopted different technologies and schema for the credential representing the health pass. 
     Random organizations (and even people) in Kunami need to be able to establish the fidelity of the credential. Specifically, they want to know that it was issued to the person presenting it, hasn't been tampered with, and hasn't been revoked. 
     In addition, these same entities need to be able to establish the provenance of the credential, specifically that it was issued by a legitimate organization who is authorized to attest to the holder's vaccination status. 
 

<p>
    This is where GCCN comes in. GCCN has three components:
</p>

 
     a trust registry network 
     a certificate implementation toolkit 
     a set of recommended vendors 
 

<p>
    The trust registry network and its associated protocol not only helps Naruba and Kunami each establish their own registries of authorized health pass credential issuers, but also enables a directory of registries, so an organization in Kunami can reliably find the registry in Naruba and discover if the issuer of Alice's credential is in it.
</p>

<p>
    The toolkit provides several important components for a working ecosystem:
</p>

 
     a template for a governance framework that governments and industry alliances can use to make their own policies. 
     schema definitions and minimum data sets for the credentials. 
     technical specifications for the software components needed to issue, hold, and verify credentials. 
     implementation guides and open source reference implementations. 
     guidance for creating the governance framework and technical implementation. 
 

<p>
    The vendor network provides a commercial ecosystem to which governments and industry associations can turn for support. The vendor network provides a set of organizations who have competence in building credential ecosystems. Over 25 separate companies and organizations support GCCN.
</p>

<p>
    With all this, GCCN doesn't actually build the ecosystems. That falls to organizations who use GCCN to instantiate the framework provided by GHPC.
</p>

<a></a>
 Building the Ecosystem 

<p>
    One of those organizations is <a href="https://cardea.app/">Cardea</a>. Cardea is a fully open-source and field-tested verifiable digital credential that meets the major requirements of the Good Health Pass Blueprint. Cardea was developed by <a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio</a> and is now a community-led project at <a href="https://www.lfph.io/">Linux Foundation Public Health (LFPH)</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Cardea was trialed on the island of Aruba by <a href="https://www.sita.aero/">SITA</a>, one of the participating companies in the Cardea initiative. SITA is a good partner for this since they're responsible for a majority of airline industry IT systems. In the pilot, travelers could prove their Covid test status at restaurants and other tourist locations around the island. The combination of a good trust framework, and self-sovereign-identity-based credential technology allowed businesses to trust tourists' health information while preserving their privacy.
</p>

<p>
    Another example of a working health pass credential ecosystem is the <a href="https://www.evernym.com/travelpass/">IATA Travel Pass</a>. Travel Pass has been developed by the <a href="https://www.iata.org/en/programs/passenger/travel-pass/">International Air Transport Association (IATA)</a> and leverages verifiable credential technology from Evernym. The IATA Travel Pass is conducting initial pilots with over 50 airlines and the <a href="https://www.businesstraveller.com/business-travel/2020/11/24/iag-working-with-iata-on-its-new-travel-pass/">International Airlines Group (IAG)</a>.
</p>

<p>
    A third example is <a href="https://trinsic.id/medcreds/">Medcreds</a> from <a href="https://www.proofmarket.io">ProofMarket</a>. Medcreds uses the <a href="https://trinsic.id/medcreds/">Trinsic API</a> to provide service. MedCreds partnered with the Georgia Academy of General Dentistry to provide free COVID-19 test credentials to their providers and patients. MedCreds allows dentists to reduce the risk of spreading and contracting COVID-19 by knowing with greater certainty the status of a patient's most recent test. 
</p>

<p>
    Cardea, IATA Travel Pass, and Medcreds have tools for hospitals, labs, and other organizations who issue passes and for the airlines and other venues who verify them. All also have wallet apps for credential holders to use in receiving credentials as well as presenting the proofs that constitute the actual travel pass from those credentials. In addition, all three initiatives include governance frameworks that service their respective ecosystem.
</p>

<p>
    Because all three are compliant with the GHPC's Blueprint and GCCN's architecture and guidance, the ecosystems they each create are part of the global ecosystem of ecosystems for health and travel passes. As more organizations, countries, and technical teams join in this, the global ecosystem of ecosystems will constitute the largest ever verifiable credential use case to date. The planning, design, and implementation show the level of effort necessary to create large credential ecosystems and provide a path for others to follow.
</p>

<p>
    As I said in <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/04/the_politics_of_vaccination_passports.shtml">The Politics of Vaccination Passports</a>, I'm persuaded that organizations like the Good Health Pass Collaborative and Global Covid Credential Network aren't the bad guys. They're just folks who see the inevitability of health and travel passes and are determined to see that it's done right, in ways that respect individual choice and personal privacy as much as possible.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>The article shows how an ASP.NET Core application could implement a sign in and a sign out with two different Azure App registrations which could also be implemented using separate identity providers (tenants). The user of the application can decide to authenticate against either one of the Azure AD clients. The clients can also be deployed on separate Azure Active directories.  Separate authentication schemes are used for both of the clients. Each client requires a scheme for the Open ID Connect sign in and the cookie session. The Azure AD client authentication is implemented using <a href="https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-identity-web">Microsoft.Identity.Web</a>.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCore6Experiments">https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCore6Experiments</a></p>



<p>The clients are setup to use a non default Open ID Connect scheme and also a non default cookie scheme. After a successful authentication, the OnTokenValidated event is used to sign into the default cookie scheme using the claims principal returned from the Azure AD client. “t1” is used for the Open ID Connect scheme and “cookiet1” is used for the second scheme. No default schemes are defined. The second Azure App Registration client configuration is setup in the same way. </p>


  services.AddAuthentication()
   .AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApp(
	Configuration.GetSection("AzureAdT1"), "t1", "cookiet1");

services.Configure&lt;OpenIdConnectOptions&gt;("t1", options =&gt;
{
	var existingOnTokenValidatedHandler 
		= options.Events.OnTokenValidated;
		
	options.Events.OnTokenValidated = async context =&gt;
	{
		await existingOnTokenValidatedHandler(context);

		await context.HttpContext.SignInAsync(
			CookieAuthenticationDefaults
				.AuthenticationScheme, context.Principal);

	};
});

services.AddAuthentication()
	.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApp(
		Configuration.GetSection("AzureAdT2"), "t2", "cookiet2");

services.Configure&lt;OpenIdConnectOptions&gt;("t2", options =&gt;
{
	var existingOnTokenValidatedHandler = options.Events.OnTokenValidated;
	options.Events.OnTokenValidated = async context =&gt;
	{
		await existingOnTokenValidatedHandler(context);

		await context.HttpContext.SignInAsync(
		   CookieAuthenticationDefaults
				.AuthenticationScheme, context.Principal);
	};
});
  


<p>The AddAuthorization is used in a standard way and no default policy is defined. We would like the user to have the possibility to choose against what tenant and client to authenticate.</p>


  services.AddAuthorization();

services.AddRazorPages()
	.AddMvcOptions(options =&gt; { })
	.AddMicrosoftIdentityUI();
  


<p>A third default scheme is added to keep the session after a successful authentication using the client schemes which authenticated. The identity is signed into this scheme after a successfully Azure AD authentication. The SignInAsync method is used for this in the OnTokenValidated event.</p>


   services.AddAuthentication(CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
    .AddCookie();
  


<p>The Configure method is setup in a standard way.</p>


  public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
{
	app.UseHttpsRedirection();
	app.UseStaticFiles();

	app.UseRouting();

	app.UseAuthentication();
	app.UseAuthorization();

	app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =&gt;
	{
		endpoints.MapRazorPages();
		endpoints.MapControllers();
	});
}
  


<p>The sign in and  the sign out needs custom implementations. The SignInT1 method is used to authenticate using the first client and the SignInT2 is used for the second. This can be called from the Razor page view. The CustomSignOut is used to sign out the correct schemes and redirect to the Azure AD endsession endpoint. The CustomSignOut method uses the clientId of the Azure AD configuration to sign out the correct session. This value can be read using the aud claim.</p>

<p>The _LoginPartial.cshtml Razor view can use the CustomAccount controller method to sign in or sign out. The available clients can be selected in a drop down control. </p>

                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
}
&lt;/ul&gt;

  


<p>The app.settings have the Azure AD settings for each client as required.</p>


  {
  "AzureAdT1": {
    "Instance": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/",
    "Domain": "damienbodhotmail.onmicrosoft.com",
    "TenantId": "7ff95b15-dc21-4ba6-bc92-824856578fc1",
    "ClientId": "46d2f651-813a-4b5c-8a43-63abcb4f692c",
    "CallbackPath": "/signin-oidc/t1",
    "SignedOutCallbackPath ": "/SignoutCallbackOidc"
    // "ClientSecret": "add secret to the user secrets"
  },
  "AzureAdT2": {
    "Instance": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/",
    "Domain": "damienbodhotmail.onmicrosoft.com",
    "TenantId": "7ff95b15-dc21-4ba6-bc92-824856578fc1",
    "ClientId": "8e2b45c2-cad0-43c3-8af2-b32b73de30e4",
    "CallbackPath": "/signin-oidc/t2",
    "SignedOutCallbackPath ": "/SignoutCallbackOidc"
    // "ClientSecret": "add secret to the user secrets"
  },
  


<p>When the application is started, the user can login using any client as required. </p>







<p>This works really good, if you don’t know which tenant is your default scheme. If you always use a default scheme with one tenant default, then you can use the  <a href="https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-identity-web/wiki/multiple-authentication-schemes">multiple-authentication-schemes</a> example like defined in the Microsoft.Identity.Web docs.</p>

They’re Containers.</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="https://rufftimo.medium.com/like-shipping-containers-verifiable-credentials-will-economically-transform-the-world-fece2b9da14a">Like Shipping Containers, Verifiable Credentials Will Economically Transform the&nbsp;World</a></p><p>Part 3: <a href="https://rufftimo.medium.com/how-verifiable-credentials-bridge-trust-domains-97155d0f3c17">How Verifiable Credentials Bridge Trust&nbsp;Domains</a></p><p>The similarities have only become more apparent, and important, now that VCs are rapidly growing in global adoption. So it’s time for an update, including some history behind the VC name and why “verifiable” is also problematic.</p><p>It can be found at my new blog location: <a href="https://credentialmaster.com/verifiable-credentials-arent-credentials-theyre-containers/">https://credentialmaster.com/verifiable-credentials-arent-credentials-theyre-containers/</a></p>

<p></p>
<p>The best new phones come with the ability to shoot 108 megapixel photos, record 4K video with stereo sound, and pack the results into a terabyte of onboard storage. But what do you do when that storage fills up?</p>
<p>If you want to keep those files, you’ll need to offload them somewhere. Since your computer probably doesn’t have more than 2Tb of storage, you’ll need an external drive. Or two. Or three. Or more. Over time, a lot more.</p>
<p>Welcome to my world.</p>
<p>Gathered here for a portrait in a corner of my desk in Manhattan are 22 hard drives, plus three SD cards that each exceed the capacities of the drives they’re laying on. And then there’s the 2Tb one in the laptop I’m using now. That one has 357.33Gb available. Most of the others you see are also full, dead, or both. Five have FireWire connections, which my current laptop doesn’t comprehend at all. I also have a similar collection of drives in Santa Barbara.</p>
<p>Photos occupy most of the data I’ve stored on all those drives. Currently my photo archives are spread between two portable drives and my laptop, and total about 7Tb. I also have a 5Tb portable drive for videos, which is back in Santa Barbara awaiting dubs off tapes. The portable photo drives are among those in the picture above. Earlier today, my laptop gave me this news about the main one, called Black 4Tb WD Photo Drive:</p>
<p></p>
<p>That’s why I’m transferring its contents over to the 10Tb drive called Elements, on the far left. A progress report:</p>
<p>About 5Tb of Elements is occupied by Apple Time Machine backups. After the transfer is done, there won’t be room for more backups. So my project now is figuring out what to do next.</p>
<p>I could get some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage">Network Attached Storage</a> (NAS). I already have used 2012-vintage 18Tb QNAP one in Santa Barbara that I’ve never been able to make work.</p>
<p>So I am tempted now to put it all in a cloud.</p>
<p>I hadn’t bothered with that before, because upstream speeds have been highly sphinctered by ISPs for decades. Here in New York, where our ISP is Spectrum, our speeds have long run 100-400 Mbps down, but only 10 Mbps up. However…. I just checked again with <a href="https://www.speedtest.net/">Speedtest.net</a>, and got <a href="https://www.speedtest.net/result/11628959761">this</a>:</p>
<p></p>
<p>And that’s over wi-fi.</p>
<p>Now I’m encouraged. But before I commit to a supplier, I’d like to hear what others recommend. Currently I’m considering <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/">Backblaze</a>, which is top rated <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/online-backup-services-reviewed-2624712">here</a>. The cost i $6/month, or less for unlimited sums of data. But I’m open to whatever.</p>
<p>[Later…] Hmm. At that last link it says this:</p>
<blockquote><p>What We Don’t Like:</p>
<p>Something I should mention is that some users have had bad experiences with Backblaze because of a not-so-apparent&nbsp;feature that maybe&nbsp;should&nbsp;be a lot more obvious: Backblaze doesn’t function as a permanent&nbsp;archive of all of your data, but instead as a mirror.</p>
<p>In other words, if you delete files on your computer, or the drive fails and you’re connected to Backblaze’s website, Backblaze will see that those files are gone and will remove them from your online account, too.</p>
<p>Granted, signing up for the forever version history option would eliminate any issues with this, but it still poses a problem for anyone using one of the limited version history options.</p></blockquote>
<p>Alas, <a href="https://help.backblaze.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035247494-Version-History-FAQ">the forever thing is complicated</a>.</p>
<p>To be clear, I want more than a mirroring of what I have on my laptop and external drives. I want to replace those external drives with cloud storage. Is that possible? Not clear.</p>
<p>Alas, for all of us, <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2020/05/15/fossil/">this problem remains</a>.</p>
<p>Oh, and Spectrum now only measures under 10Mbps upstream. So forget the cloud.</p>

<p>Listen Up</p>
<p>By Doc Searls<br>
April 16, 1999&nbsp;</p>
<p>“All I know is that first you’ve got to get mad. You’ve got to say, I’m a human being, goddammit! My life has value! So I want you to get up now. I want all of you to get up out of your chairs. I want you to get up right now and go to the window, open it, and stick your head out, and yell, ‘I’m as mad as hell, and I’m not going to take this anymore!'”<br>
— Howard Beale, in&nbsp;Network, by Paddy Chayevsky</p>
 
<p>Bob Davis is the CEO of Lycos, Inc., whose growing portfolio of companies (excuse me,&nbsp;portals) now includes&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lycos.html/">Lycos</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hotbot.html/">Hotbot</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.whowhere.lycos.com/">WhoWhere</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tripod.html/">Tripod</a>. I’m sure Bob is a great guy. And I’m sure Lycos is a great company. A lot of people seem to like them both. And you have to admire both his ambition and his success. To witness both, read his&nbsp;<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/pcweek/stories/news/0,4153,383571,00.html">interview with PC Week</a>, where he predicts that the Lycos Network (the sum of all its portals) will overtake Yahoo as “#1 on the Web.”</p>
<p>Lycos will win, Davis says, because “We have a collection of quality properties that are segmented into best-of-breed categories, and our reach has been catapulting.”</p>
<p>I can speak for Hotbot, which is still my first-choice search engine; but by a shrinking margin. I often test search engines by looking for strings of text buried deep in long documents on my own site. Hotbot always won in the past. But since Lycos bought it, Hotbot has become more of a portal and less of a search tool. Its page is now a baffling mass of ads and links. And its searches find less.</p>
<p>In today’s test,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.infoseek.com/">Infoseek</a>&nbsp;won. Last week,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.excite.com/">Excite</a>&nbsp;won. Both found pages that Hotbot seems to have forgotten.</p>
<p>Why? Bob Davis gives us a good answer.</p>
<p>“We’re a media company,” he says. “We make our money by delivering an audience that people want to pay for.”</p>
<p>Note the two different species here:&nbsp;audience&nbsp;and&nbsp;people. And look at their qualities. One is “delivered.” The other pays. In other words, one is cargo and the other is money.</p>
<p>Well, I don’t care if Lycos’ stock goes to the moon and splits three times along the way. The only #1 on the Web is the same as the only #1 on the phone: the people who use it. And the time will come when people will look at portals not as sources of “satisfying experiences” (another of Davis’ lines) but as useless intermediaries between supply and demand.</p>



&nbsp;<p></p>
 Words of Walt 
<p>You there, impotent, loose in the knees,<br>
open your scarfed chops till I blow grit within you.<br>
Spread your palms and lift the flaps of your pockets.<br>
I am not to be denied. I compel.<br>
It is time to explain myself. Let us stand up.<br>
I know I am solid and sound.<br>
To me the converging objects of the universe perpetually flow.<br>
</p>
<p>I know that I am august,<br>
I do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself<br>
or be understood.<br>
I see that the elementary laws never apologize.</p>
<p>.<br>
— Walt Whitman, from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.searls.com/bookstore.html#Anchor">Song of Myself</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Media company” guys like Davis are still in a seller’s market for wisdom that was BS even when only the TV guys spoke it —&nbsp;back when it literally&nbsp;required&nbsp;the movie “Network.” That market will dry up. Why? Because we’ve been mad as hell for about hundred years, and&nbsp;now we don’t have to take it anymore.</p>
<p>Three reasons.</p>
 
 Humanity. This is what Walt Whitman reminded us about more than a hundred years ago.&nbsp;We are not impotent. Media companies may call us seats and eyeballs and targets, but&nbsp;that’s their problem. They don’t get who we are or what we can — and will —&nbsp;do. And the funny thing is, they don’t get that what makes us powerful is what they think makes&nbsp;them&nbsp;powerful: the Internet. It gives us choices. Millions of them. We don’t have to settle for “channels” any more. Or “portals” that offer views of the sky through their own little windows. Or “sticky” sites that are the moral equivalent of flypaper. 
 Demand.&nbsp;There never was a demand for messages, and now it shows, big time. Because the Internet is a meteor that is smacking the world of business with more force than the rock that offed the dinosaurs, and it is pushing out a&nbsp;tsunami of demand&nbsp;like nothing supply has ever seen. Businesses that welcome the swell are in for some fun surfing. Businesses that don’t are going to drown in it. 
 Obsolescence. Even the media guys are tired of their own B.S. and are&nbsp;finally in the market for clues. 
 
<p>Alvin Toffler had it right in&nbsp;The Third Wave.&nbsp;Industry (The Second Wave) “violently split apart two aspects of our lives that had always been one… production and consumption… In so doing, it drove a giant invisible wedge into our economy, our psyches … it ripped apart the underlying unity of society, creating a way of life filled with economic tension.” Today all of us play producer roles in our professions and consumer roles in our everyday lives. This chart shows the difference (and tension) between these radically different points of view — both of which all of us hold:</p>




Producer view

 
 Consumer view 
 



Metaphor
Business is shipping (“loading the channel,” “moving products,” “delivering messages”)
Business is shopping (“browsing,” “looking,” “bargaining,” “buying”)


Orientation
Business is about moving goods from one to many (producers to consumers)
Business is about buying and selling, one to one


Markets
Markets are shooting ranges: consumers are “targets”
Markets are markets: places to shop, buy stuff and talk to people


Relationships
Primary relationshiphs are with customers, which are more often distributors &amp; retailers rather than consumers
Primary relationships are with vendors, and with other customers



<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>These are all just clues, which are easily deniable facts. Hence a line once spoken of Apple: “the clue train stopped there four times a day for ten years and they never took delivery.” But Apple was just an obvious offender. All of marketing itself remains clueless so long as it continues to treat customers as “eyeballs,” “targets,” “seats” and “consumers.”</p>
<p>For the past several months, I have been working with Rick Levine, David Weinberger and Chris Locke on a new railroad for clues: a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cluetrain.com/">ClueTrain</a>.</p>
<p>Our goal is&nbsp;to burn down Marketing As Usual. Here is the logic behind the ambition:</p>
 
<p>Markets are conversations<br>
Conversations are fire<br>
Marketing is arson</p>
 
<p>The result is&nbsp;<a href="http://public.wsj.com/careers/resources/documents/19990412-frontlines.htm">here</a>&nbsp;— in what The Wall Street Journal calls “presumptuous, arrogant, and absolutely brilliant.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cluetrain.com/">Take a ride</a>. If you like it,&nbsp;<a href="http://cluetrain.com/signer.cgi">sign up</a>. Feel free to set fires with it, add a few of your own, or flame the ones you don’t agree with. What matters is the conversation. We want everybody talking about this stuff. If they do, MAU is toast.</p>
<p>Here is my own short form of the Manifesto (inspired by Martin Luther, the long version has 95 Theses). Feel free to commit arson with (or to) any of these points as well.</p>
 
 
 Ten facts about highly effective markets: 
 
 Markets are conversations.<br>
None of the other metaphors for markets —&nbsp;bulls, bears, battlefields, arenas, streets or invisible hands — does full justice to the social nature of markets.&nbsp;Real market conversations are social. They happen between human beings. Not between senders and receivers, shooters and targets, advertisers and demographics. 
 The first markets were markets.<br>
They were real places that thrived at the crossroads of cultures. They didn’t need a market model, because they&nbsp;were&nbsp;the model market. More than religion, war or family, markets were&nbsp;real places&nbsp;where communities came together. They weren’t just where sellers did business with buyers. They were the place where everybody got together to hang out, talk, tell stories and learn interesting stuff about each other and the larger world.&nbsp;‘ 
 Markets are more about demand than supply.<br>
The term “market” comes from the latin&nbsp;mercere, which means “to buy.” Even a modern market is called a “shopping center” rather than a “selling center.” Bottom line: every market has more buyers than sellers. And the buyers have the money. 
 Human voices trump robotic ones.<br>
Real voices are honest, open, natural, uncontrived. Every identity that speaks has a voice. We know each other by how we sound. That goes for companies and markets as well as people. When a voice is full of shit, we all know it — whether the voice tells us “your call is important to us” or that a Buick is better than a Mercedes. 
 The real market leaders are people whose minds and hands are worn by the work they do.<br>
And it has been that way ever since our ancestors’ authority was expressed by surnames that labeled their occupations — names like Hunter, Weaver, Fisher and Smith. In modern parlance, the most knowledge and the best expertise is found at the “point of practice:” That’s where most of the work gets done. 
 Markets are made by real people.<br>
Not by surreal abstractions that insult customers by calling them “targets,” “seats,” “audiences,” “demographics” and “eyeballs” — all synonyms for&nbsp;consumers, which Jerry Michalski of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sociate.com/">Sociate</a>&nbsp;calls “brainless gullets who live only to gulp products and expel cash.” 
 Business is not a conveyor belt that runs from production to consumption.<br>
Our goods are more than “content” that we “package” and “move” by “loading” them into a “channel” and “address” for “delivery.” The business that matters most is about shopping, not shipping. And the people who run it are the customers and the people who talk to them. 
 Mass markets have the same intelligence as germ populations.<br>
Their virtues are appetite and reproduction. They grow by contagion. Which is why nobody wants to admit belonging to one. 
 There is no demand for messages.<br>
To get what this means, imagine what would happen if mute buttons on remote controls delivered “we don’t want to hear this” messages directly back to advertisers. 
 Most advertising is unaccountable.<br>
Or worse, it’s useless. An old advertising saying goes, “I know half my advertising is wasted. I just don’t know which half.” But even this is a lie. Nearly all advertising is wasted. Even the most accountable form of advertising — the junk mail we euphemistically call “direct marketing” —&nbsp;counts a 3% response rate as a success. No wonder most of us sort our mail over the trash can. Fairfax Cone, who co-founded Foote Cone &amp; Belding many decades ago, said “Advertising is what you do when you can’t go see somebody. That’s all it is.” With the Net you&nbsp;can&nbsp;go see somebody. More importantly, they can see you. More importantly than that, you can both talk to each other. And make real markets again.

<p>Formalized journalism is outnumbered.</p>
<p>In the industrialized world (and in much of the world that isn’t), nearly everyone of a double-digit age has a Net-connected mobile device for sharing words they write and&nbsp;scenes they shoot.</p>
<p>While this doesn’t obsolesce professional journalists, it marginalizes and re-contextualizes them. Worse, it exposes the blindness within their formalities. Dave Winer lays this out clearly in <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/06/23/162312.html?title=theyCantSeeWhatTheyCantSee">They can’t see what they can’t see</a>. An excerpt:</p>
<blockquote><p>Journalism, academia, government and the corporate world all hire from the same talent pool.</p>
<p>They go to the same universities, get their news from the same sources. Corporate people take government jobs, then go back to the corporations. The people move fluidly in and out of each bucket.</p>
<p>So you get the same story, the reality they believe in, developed over centuries, that is radically different from the reality most other people experience. The story recited daily at CNN, MSNBC, The New Yorker, NYT. The world changes, again and again, and the story they tell is how angry this makes them, and how everyone must snap back.</p>
<p>New technologies can make change possible, like the one we’re using now.</p>
<p>We would never have Trump if it weren’t for Twitter.</p></blockquote>
<p>Marshall McLuhan, dead since 1980, had something to say about that:</p>
<blockquote><p>People don’t want to know the cause of anything. They do not want to know why radio caused Hitler and Gandhi alike. They do not want to know that print caused anything whatever.</p></blockquote>
<p>Also,</p>
<blockquote><p>All media work us over completely. They are so pervasive… that they leave no part of us untouched unaffected, unaltered… Any understanding of social and cultural change is impossible without a knowledge of the way media work as environments.</p></blockquote>
<p>What could be more worked-over than our new <a href="https://dsearls.medium.com/what-does-the-internet-make-of-us-118421ac5e">nature as digital beings</a>? Consider&nbsp;where and what you are reading right now, on your desk, your lap or in your hand. This was barely imaginable when the word “journalism” <a href="https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=journalism&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2019&amp;corpus=26&amp;smoothing=3&amp;direct_url=t1%3B%2Cjournalism%3B%2Cc0">came into use</a> around 1830.</p>
<p>What are we now? While remaining no less embodied than we ever were, we are incorporeal inhabitants of a digital world, absent of distance and gravity, where the only preposition that fully applies is&nbsp;with. Unless we aren’t. Ephemerality runs deep, and the Web is a whiteboard.</p>
<p>I don’t have an answer to the question in my headline. I tried one out three years ago, in my first, last and only TEDx talk, <a href="https://tedxsantabarbara.com/2018/doc-searls/">The story isn’t the whole story</a>. To summarize, we gotta start local.</p>
<p>Because it is essential to be real with each other in the physical world, especially when fully relevant news actually happens. Conspiracy theories and other forms of bullshit will always be everywhere, but it’s harder for them to apply or survive when your building is on fire or your neighborhood is flooding.</p>
<p>Outside of that, I’m starting to think we need a new discipline: one that doesn’t start with the word&nbsp;journal. And decades may pass before we have it.</p>

<p>Today’s <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/new-fido-ux-guidelines-and-specification-enhancements/">FIDO Alliance announcement</a> describes the enhancements in the second version as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Enhancements to FIDO standards to accelerate passwordless in the enterprise</p>
<p>The FIDO Alliance has announced enhancements to its FIDO2 specifications, which include several new features that will be helpful for passwordless enterprise deployments and other complex security applications. Both FIDO2 specifications were recently updated by their governing bodies – with the World Wide Web Consortium  (W3C) approving WebAuthn Level 2 and FIDO doing the same for CTAP 2.1.</p>
<p>Key to these enhancements is enterprise attestation, which provides enterprise IT with improved management of FIDO authenticators used by employees. Enterprise attestation enables better binding of an authenticator to an account, assists with usage tracking and other management functions including credential and pin management, and biometric enrollment required in the enterprise.</p>
<p>Other updates include support for cross-origin iFrames and Apple attestation, as well as improvements to resident credentials. More details on these and other FIDO specification enhancements are available <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2-enhancements/">here</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p>2020年に、物理的な世界からサイバー世界への移行がかつてないスピードで進みました。COVID-19がその移行を課したのです。5年から10年分の変化が数ヶ月の間に行われたと言う人もいます。そこでは、ステイホーム・ポリシーにより物理的な世界でのコミュニケーション能力が大きく制限され、サイバー・コミュニケーションに大きく依存するようになりました。サイバー空間では、あらゆるコミュニケーションはDigital Being（サイバースペースにおける私たちのデジタル表現）を通じて行われます。しかし、Digital Beingが無形である以上、私たちの「安全な生活」に欠かせない、当たり前だと思っている物理的な存在の多くの特性がそこにはありません。このセッションでは、私たちのデジタルライフを安全で安心なものにするために必要な、Digital Beingの7つの原則を概観します。</p>The post <a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2021/06/4801/">Identiverse: 7 Principles of Digital Being</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.sakimura.org">@_Nat Zone</a>.

<p>…and got a notice that said,</p>
<p></p>
<p>That was to my building in Manhattan: a three-story walk-up in a district that’s post-dangerous but pre-gentrified. In other words, safe; but not beyond worry that someone could walk off with a box on the steps that says Amazon on it.</p>
<p>We live on the top floor, so it took me a minute to get from my desk to the front door, where there was nothing. So I went to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/contact-us/">Amazon’s Contact Us page</a> and got this:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then, after I clicked on the big yellow button, a dialog ensued :</p>
 
 
<blockquote>
 Hi! It’s Amazon’s messaging assistant again.

<p>Messaging Assistant | Customer Service</p>
 
 OK, looks like the delivery status may have been updated too soon. 
 
 
 
 
 The good news is it should arrive soon. Give us until end of day Wednesday, Jun 23. 
 
 
 
 
 Really appreciate your patience with this. Is there anything else I can help with?

 No, that’s all

<p>Messaging Assistant | Customer Service</p>
 
 Thanks for choosing Amazon. I’m here to help whenever you have an issue. 
 
<p>12:50 PM</p>
 
 Messaging Assistant has left. Thanks for contacting Amazon! 
</blockquote>
<p>This kind of thing has happened before; not just with Amazon, and not just here. In fact, it has happened enough times for me to wonder whether there is a method to the madness.</p>
<p>I mean, is “the delivery status may have been updated too soon” an occurrence that’s common for a reason? Also, might that reason be technical, human, neither or both?</p>
<p>To be fair, this is not a big deal. Progress is how the miraculous becomes mundane, and this is a good example of it the mundane miraculous at work. “No sooner said than shipped” is the new norm. So are conversations with robots.</p>
<p>I’d love it if one could give me answers below, but that feature isn’t working right now. So feel free to tweet yours or something. Thanks!</p>

 Example Design of an Authorization System with Verifiable Credentials and the Tradeoffs 

 Problem summary 

<p>In this blog post, I’ll cover an example design that relies upon verifiable credentials where a CFO is delegating access to their assistant to authorize purchases made by the company. The primary focus of this blog post is to highlight the different problems that are likely to occur when going down the path of building an authorization system with verifiable credentials. I’ll be sure to keep things at a higher level so that anyone can understand these tradeoffs, but take you through the details that would be thought through by an architect designing the system. Enjoy, and feel free to leave comments or reach out to me for questions, suggested improvements, or other aspects I didn’t fully consider.</p>

 Use case description 

<p>In this use case, the issuer is an employer who wishes to provide an employee credential to their CFO. Now their CFO as a part of their job has a lot of capabilities afforded to them as a senior executive. Let’s say this CFO has two abilities. They can sign off on quarterly reports and they can authorize purchases. Now let’s say the employer issues them the following credential:</p>

   <code>{
 "@context": [
   "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
   {
    "@vocab": "https://example.com/employer/"
   }
  ],
  "id": "http://example.com/employer/credentials/123",
  "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "EmployerCredential"],
  "issuer": "https://example.com/employer",
  "issuanceDate": "2010-01-01T19:73:24Z",
  "credentialSubject": {
    "id": "did:example:cfo",
    "jobTitle": "Chief Financial Officer",
    "employeeNumber": 123,
  },
  "revocation": {
    "id": "http://example.gov/revocations/738",
    "type": "SimpleRevocationList2017"
  },
  "proof": {
      "type": "Ed25519Signature2020",
      "created": "2019-12-11T03:50:55Z",
      "proofValue": "....",
      "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",
      "verificationMethod": "https://example.com/employer/key1"
    }
}
</code>   

<p>All is good and well, now the CFO can do their job. Now let’s say the CFO has been bombarded with purchase authorization requests recently while trying to prepare the quarterly report and has asked their assistant to assist with the backlog of purchase requests as long as the requests are under $10,000. To do this, the CFO decides to delegate their employee credential to their assistant because the payment authorization system relies upon the jobTitle attribute to determine the capabilities.</p>

<p>So, the CFO delegates the following credential to their assistant and hands over their employee credential too:</p>

   <code>{
 "@context": [
   "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
   {
    "@vocab": "https://example.com/employer/"
   }
  ],
  "id": "http://example.com/employer/credentials/123",
  "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "EmployerCredential"],
  "issuer": "did:example:cfo",
  "issuanceDate": "2010-01-01T19:73:24Z",
  "credentialSubject": {
    "id": "did:example:assistant",
    "jobTitle": "Chief Financial Officer",
    "employeeNumber": 123,
  },
  "revocation": {
    "id": "http://example.gov/revocations/738",
    "type": "SimpleRevocationList2017"
  },
  "proof": {
      "type": "Ed25519Signature2020",
      "created": "2019-12-11T03:50:55Z",
      "proofValue": "....",
      "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",
      "verificationMethod": "did:example:cfo#key1"
    }
}
</code>   

<blockquote>
  <p>Side rhetorical consideration around the semantics of this VC as a standalone VC, why is the CFO declaring that their assistant has the jobTitle “Chief Financial Officer” now? This is what I mean when I say using verifiable credentials for authorization systems introduces bad semantics. To skirt around authorization systems we’re bending the semantics of the claims in the credentials in ways that don’t make sense. And that’s ignoring the second and third-order effects that are inherently going to be introduced!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Great, so now the assistant can generate the following delegated verifiable Presentation to authorize payments:</p>

   <code>{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
   {
    "@vocab": "https://example.com/employer/"
   }
  ],
  "id": "http://example.com/employer/credentials/789",
  "type": ["VerifiablePresentation"],
  "verifiableCredential": [
    {
        "@context": [
            "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
            {
                "@vocab": "https://example.com/employer/"
            }
        ],
        "id": "http://example.com/employer/credentials/123",

<p>Sweet, now the assistant can authorize payments! Let’s review what the steps are for the payment authorization system now with this.</p>

<p>VP Request checks</p>

 
   Check that the verificationMethod is associated with the authentication proofPurpose for the assistant. 
   Check that the verificationMethod for the VP proof is associated with the delegation credential <code>credentialSubject.id</code> 
   Check that the proofValue is valid in the VP proof (the bottom one) based on the associated verificationMethod for the assistant 
   Check that the challenge matches the VP Request 
 

<p>Delegation Credential checks</p>

 
   Check that the verificationMethod is associated with the assertionMethod proofPurpose for the CFO in the delegation credential 
   Check that the verificationMethod in the delegation credential is associated with the issuer property of the delegation credential 
   Check that the proofValue is valid in the delegation credential proof (the middle one) based on the associated verificationMethod for the CFO 
   Check that the <code>credentialSubject.jobTitle</code> has “Chief Financial Officer” in the delegation credential 
   Check that the issuer property in the delegation credential matches the <code>credentialSubject.id</code> in the original credential 
 

<p>Original Credential checks</p>

 
   Check that the verificationMethod is associated with the assertionMethod proofPurpose for the employer in the original credential 
   Check that the verificationMethod in the original credential is associated with the issuer property of the original credential 
   Check that the proofValue is valid in the original credential proof (the top one) based on the associated verificationMethod for the CFO 
   Check that the <code>credentialSubject.jobTitle</code> has “Chief Financial Officer” in the original credential 
   Check that the original credential isn’t revoked 
 

<blockquote>
  <p>Note to consider: If the credentials in the verifiable presentation are ordered incorrectly that’s going to introduce some problems</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But wait how did the authorization system know that the assistant has been attenuated with limited permission to only authorize payments below $10,000? Well, we’ve got a few different ways we could do that, let’s take a look at the ways we can extend this simple delegation pattern.</p>

 Extension 1: CFO adds a <code>maximumAuthorizationLimit</code> property to the delegation credential 

<p>So in this scenario, the CFO adds <code>maximumAuthorizationLimit</code> property like so:</p>

   <code>{
    "@context": [
        "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
        {
            "@vocab": "https://example.com/employer/"
        }
    ],
    "id": "http://example.com/employer/credentials/123",
    "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "EmployerCredential"],
    "issuer": "did:example:cfo",
    "issuanceDate": "2010-01-01T19:73:24Z",
    "credentialSubject": {
        "id": "did:example:assistant",
        "jobTitle": "Chief Financial Officer",
        "employeeNumber": 123,
        "maximumAuthorizationLimit": 10000
    },
    "proof": {
        "type": "Ed25519Signature2020",
        "created": "2019-12-11T03:50:55Z",

        "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",
        "verificationMethod": "did:example:cfo#key1"
    }
}
</code>   

<p>and the verifiable presentation would now look like this:</p>

   <code>{
  "@context": [

        "proofPurpose": "authentication",
        "verificationMethod": "did:example:assistant#key1"
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Awesome, so now we have a verifiable presentation that attenuates the delegated capabilities of making authorization payments and limits the payments to $10000 for the assistant. This new property introduces some new checks though in our business logic.</p>

 
   Check that the <code>credentialSubject.maximumAuthorizationLimit</code> in the delegation credential is below the limit afforded to the <code>credentialSubject.jobTitle</code> 
   Check that the payment hasn’t exceeded the <code>credentialSubject.maximumAuthorizationLimit</code> 
 

<p>But wait, when we delegated the ability for the assistant to authorize payments we also inadvertently allowed the assistant to sign off on the quarterly reports! Oh no! Now, we’ve got a legal liability issue on our hands.
We’ll need to build on top of option 1 to make sure that the assistant isn’t signing off on our quarterly reports too and so that we can adhere to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege">principle of least authority</a>. We’ll cover that in option 2.</p>

 Extension 2: limiting the assistant’s abilities to only payment authorization capabilities 

<p>Since the CFO has two capabilities, we need to disable the one that would allow the assistant to also sign off on quarterly reports. We’re going to go ahead and do this via the introduction of the <code>canSignQuartlyReports</code> claim.</p>

<p>So now the delegation credential looks like this:</p>

   <code>{
    "@context": [
        "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
        {
            "@vocab": "https://example.com/employer/"
        }
    ],

    "issuer": "did:example:cfo",
    "issuanceDate": "2010-01-01T19:73:24Z",
    "credentialSubject": {
        "id": "did:example:assistant",
        "jobTitle": "Chief Financial Officer",
        "employeeNumber": 123,
        "maximumAuthorizationLimit": 10000,
        "canSignQuartlyReports": false
    },
    "proof": {

        "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",
        "verificationMethod": "did:example:cfo#key1"
    }
}
</code>

        "proofPurpose": "authentication",
        "verificationMethod": "did:example:assistant#key1"
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Finally, we’ve got a properly attenuated delegation verifiable credential to address our use case! So what’s the issue with this? First off, we’re using only a toy example here where the CFO has only two capabilities.
Most businesses aren’t paying CFOs the big bucks to only handle those two things though (If they are let me know, I’m sure I can figure that job out 😊). This means that for every additional capability that we don’t want to be delegated we have to add a permission property. By doing this we’re effectively building a deny list with only one capability removed to enable a single capability. Why not build off of and allow list model instead? (Hint this is the approach ZCAP-LDs take)</p>

<p>So our delegation credential could end up looking something like this:</p>

   <code>{
    "@context": [
        "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
        {
            "@vocab": "https://example.com/employer/"
        }
    ],
    "id": "http://example.com/employer/credentials/123",
    "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "EmployerCredential"],
    "issuer": "did:example:cfo",
    "issuanceDate": "2010-01-01T19:73:24Z",
    "credentialSubject": {
        "id": "did:example:assistant",
        "jobTitle": "Chief Financial Officer",
        "employeeNumber": 123,
        "maximumAuthorizationLimit": 10000,
        "canSignQuartlyReports": false,
        "canDoXCapability": false,
        "canDoYCapability": false,
        "canDoZCapability": false,
        ...
    },
    "proof": {
        "type": "Ed25519Signature2020",
        "created": "2019-12-11T03:50:55Z",
        "proofValue": "....",
        "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",
        "verificationMethod": "did:example:cfo#key1"
    }
}
</code>   

 Tradeoffs with this design 

<p>Furthermore, the semantics of the claims in this new credential is quite odd. We’ve effectively combined a claims token and a permission token into a single verifiable Credential here. By doing this we’re far more likely to be issuing and reissuing the same credential many times as access to the delegatee needs to be updated. This also has second-order effects on the maintainability and adaptability that are best described by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter">principle of least knowledge</a>.</p>

<p>It also just so happens, these types of deny lists are awesome things to get your hands on as well when you’re performing the reconnaissance phase of a penetration test to break into a system. Now our system design is helping the attackers assuming they get ahold of one of the credentials, but none of the keys. If they get the keys, problems that are better left out of scope for this writeup occur.</p>

<p>Additionally, the fact that we need to perform 16 checks just to achieve our goal means that it’s highly likely that one gets missed and an authorization bypass vulnerability is introduced. As is pointed out in the CCG mailing list though, this is mainly a byproduct of the fact we’re performing delegation rather than the usage of VCs themselves. However, delegation is only complicated when done correctly. After all, when people are sharing their Netflix passwords they too are delegating and that is a simple implementation for the verifier. So the takeaway here is that the more we can reduce the number of checks when building transparent delegation the more resilient and secure the authorization system is likely to be.</p>

 Conclusion 

<p>In conclusion, I stand by the opinion that utilizing verifiable credentials to build authorization systems is possible, but more work than is necessary. Hopefully, this walk-through helps to understand why I’ve come to this conclusion. However, just because I’ve decided I’m probably not going to use VCs in this way doesn’t mean you shouldn’t. Just like any technology, some tradeoffs occur when deciding how you approach your system design. It may be the case that this is the simplest method to achieve your use case. If that’s true then by all means go for it. However, I suspect things can be simplified through the use of <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/zcap-ld/">ZCAP-LD</a>. ZCAP-LD is built on the concept of an object capabilities model which is well suited for authorization systems (but not for making claims about a subject). I’ll be writing up a follow-up blog on how the same use case described above could be designed with ZCAP-LD and show the differences between the two. Be on the lookout for that to come next!</p>

 Common Delegation Patterns in the Verifiable Credential Ecosystem 

<p>It’s commonly understood that verifiable credentials are a useful data model for expressing provenance and authority of data. In other words, they’re great for solving the “who says what” problem in a digital ecosystem. However, did you know that there are three ways in which you can utilize VCs and DIDs to enable delegation and attenuated delegation for more complex scenarios? In this blog post, I’ll cover the three patterns you can use with examples to help you figure out some of the more advanced capabilities of the VC data model. See below for more details!</p>

 Terminology 

<p>Since it’s quite common to see these terms within the IAM space, I figured it would be useful to first cover what each term means in simple term.</p>

<p>Delegation: This is the ability for someone to share their abilities with another user within the system. There’s multiple ways this can be done all with different forms of tradeoffs.</p>

 
   
    <p>A user who shares their password with another user is performing delegation, but not in a way that allows an authorization endpoint (often times called a “verifier”) to be able to uniquely differentiate between the two users. This inability to differentiate at the authorization endpoint often leads to concerns around the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confused_deputy_problem">confused deputy problem</a>.</p>
   
   
    <p>This when the system has been designed to allow the user to share their abilities with another user. The most common way this shows up today is with google document links. When a user “allows anyone with this link to view/comment/edit” they’re granting abilites to other users in a delegated way. The difference being the system can identify these unique users, which is commonly seen via the further delegation based upon an email address or organization.</p>
   
 

<p>Attenuated delegation: This is when the user opts to share only a portion of the abilities that they have. So looking at our options from delegation, option 1 would not allow this because the user is sharing all the same abilities that they have when logging into an account. So if an admin shares their password, the person they share the password with has admin abilities as well. One of the more common examples I can think of when attenuated delegation that is in use today is when a valet key is given to a valet. This key gives the valet access to drive the vehicle, but doesn’t allow them to open a glovebox or trunk for example. In this case, the driver of the vehichle is able to share only a portion of their abilities (driving) without sharing all of their abilities (opening a glovebox or trunk). In almost every system I’ve seen, this has to be intentionally designed into the system.</p>

 Delegation without attenuation by using DID Documents 

<p>As an example, let’s say we have the two following DID Documents:</p>

<p>Alice’s DID Document:</p>

<p>Bob’s DID Document:</p>

   <code>{
    "@context": [
        "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",

<p>In this example we can see that Alice has the capability to delegate to Bob the ability for him to assert on her behalf.
In the case of the following VC, bob could then create a valid verifiable presentation based on the following verifiable

<p>This effectively is a method to allow Alice to add bob’s public key to her did document and giving him a copy of the verifiable credential to delegate him to act on her behalf. However, because this pattern relies on Alice granting Bob full authority to perform any action on her behalf, it lacks attenuation, but does have delegation.</p>

 Delegation by VCs 

<p>Additionally, there’s a well documented case to be able to establish delegation using just VCs without the ability to attenuate the data. See <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/#subject-passes-a-verifiable-credential-to-someone-else">Section Appendix C.5</a> for more details on this pattern.</p>

 Attenuated Delegation by VCs 

<p>Further, by combining the pattern described in <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/#subject-passes-a-verifiable-credential-to-someone-else">Section Appendix C.5</a> and combining it with the usage of a selective disclosure scheme like BBS signatures, we can enable an attenuated delegation pattern.</p>

<p>This is done via modifying the type of proof used to sign the credential and then utilizing the selective disclosure to limit the data. Using the following original verifiable credential:</p>

   <code>{
    "@context": [
        "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",

    "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "PermanentResidentCard"],
    "issuer": "did:example:issuer",

        "familyName": "SMITH",

 Conclusion 

<p>So there’s a few different take aways from this that should be highlighted. First and foremost VCs and DIDs have some really interesting capabilities that enable delegation and attenuated delegation. However, it’s not always advantageous and requires thorough understanding of the use case that’s trying to be built with DIDs and VCs and whether or not delegation needs to be enabled or disabled. In some cases, it’s being left in when there’s an expectation that a credential is only able to be used by a single holder. Finally, it should be noted that while VCs are capable of being used for authorization systems, it’s generally not a good idea to do so. This is because the complexity (based on the number of checks) of the authorization system is quite high and the semantics have not been designed in a way that align well with most authorization systems meaning a vulnerability is more likely to be introduced. If you’re looking for these capabilities, I would recommend you look to the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/zcap-ld/">ZCAP-LD data model</a> which is designed especially for these concepts. And if you’re still confused and would like some help please reach out and I can see how I can help.</p>

  <p>Summary:      The self-sovereign internet underscores a tension between those who desire perfect oversight of society and those who desire perfect privacy. In this post, I explore a method for conditional legibility of private communications.</p>



<p>
    In <a href="https://blockchain.tno.nl/blog/self-sovereign-communication/">Self-Sovereign Communication</a>, Oskar Van Deventer, discusses the communications layer enabled by DIDs. This is the same layer that I've labeled the self-sovereign internet.
</p>

<p>
    Oskar lays out nine requirements for self-sovereign communications (emphasis added):
</p>

 
     The communication channel shall be usable for machine-readable issuer-holder-verifier interactions . 
     The communication channel shall be protected against eavesdropping, impersonation, message modification and repudiation. 
     Parties shall be able to digitally find each other and to establish a communication channel. 
     The communication channel between counterparties shall be persistent. 
     The communication channel shall be intrinsically symmetrical. 
     The communication channel shall not unnecessarily disclose information between counterparties or to third parties. 
     The communication channel shall be unilaterally closable. 
     The communication channel shall not depend on third parties more than needed. 
     The communication channel shall enable compliance with legal requirements, like legal intercept. 
 

<p>I was pleased to see these principles laid out clearly because many of them are often discussed (including by me) as properties of DIDComm, without the precision Oskar imposes.</p>
<p>The last, as Oskar concedes, is likely to be the most controversial. Indeed, when I read it my first reaction was to start arguing. If complying with legal requirements means creating backdoors to DIDComm, I'd oppose it.</p>
<p>The problem with backdoors for complying with legal requirements is that now developers and cloud operators are left with the task of determining who the good guys are. The whole point of decentralized communication systems is to avoid the kind of centralized, single-point-of-failure that backdoors imply.</p>

<a></a>
 Reciprocal Negotiated Accountability 

<p>
    In <a href="https://www.evernym.com/blog/a-call-for-reciprocal-negotiated-accountability/">Reciprocal Negotiated Accountability</a>, Daniel Hardman proposes an alternative to backdoors.
</p>

<p>Daniel's idea is to combine two capabilities to create a decentralized system for enabling accountability.</p>
<p>The first is digital watermarks and data terms of service. The watermark is a cryptographically signed addition to the original document that states the terms behind the sharing. For example, a sales agreement could include data sharing terms that state the recipient may not disclose named aspects of the document except under legal subpoena.</p>
<p>The second is provisional anonymity where identifying information is encrypted and the encrypted packaged is shared with the recipient. The keys to decrypt the identifying information are shared with a third party under escrow with legal requirements that the keys only be reveled to the recipient under specific conditions.</p>
<p>Daniel combines these into a decentralized system of opt-in agreements between parties that are tailored to the context and circumstances of the specific communications channel and data sharing. The legal agreement defines the requirements that must be met for access.</p>
<p>Daniel calls this "reciprocal negotiated accountability" because both parties negotiate an agreement about how shared data will be treated.</p>
<p>Daniel's solution won't make those who wish for unfettered access to communications channels happy. But it represents an alternative to backdoors that solves many of the problems backdoors present while protecting privacy for legitimate uses–as negotiated by the parties sharing data.</p>

  <p>Summary: I'm attended the Hyperledger Global Forum this last week–all virtual. I spoke on DIDComm and the Self-Sovereign Internet. If you're not up to speed with DIDComm and how it creates a secure overlay network on TCP/IP, you should be. I consider it one of the most important things to come out of the SSI movement.</p>


DIDs and DID-based Communication or DIDComm form the second layer of the SSI stack, providing a secure communications layer for the exchange of identity information via verifiable credentials. But, because of it's flexibility and the ability to define protocols on top of DIDComm messaging, it promises to be as important as the identity layer it enables. 

<a></a>
 Autonomic Identifiers 

<p>
    The foundation of the self-sovereign internet is built on <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml">autonomic identifiers</a>. I'm going to speak about Peer DIDs here, but KERI and other systems provide autonomic identifiers that serve just as well.
</p>

<p>
    Identity systems provide the means to remember, recognize, and rely on other parties in a relationship. To do so, they use identifiers, convenient handles that name the thing being remembered.
</p>

<p>
    Identifiers are issued to or created by a controller (e.g. Alice) who, by virtue of knowing the authentication factors (e.g. password, key fob, cryptographic key), can make authoritative statements about the identifier (e.g. claim it by logging in).
</p>


	<a></a>
	Bindings between Alice, a Peer DID, and the public key it points to. (click to enlarge)


<p>
    In an autonomic identity architecture, the controller, Alice, generates a public-private key pair, derives a globally unique identifier, and shares the identifier and the currently associated public key with others to create relationships. Alice uses her private key to sign statements that authenticate herself and authorize use of the identifier. A digital signature also provides the means for Alice to cryptographically respond to challenges so she can prove she controls the identifier. These self-authentication and self-authorization capabilities make the identifier self-certifying and self-managing, meaning that there is no external third party, not even a ledger, needed for Alice to manage and use the identifier and prove to others the integrity of the bindings between herself and the identifier.
</p>

<p>
    Any entity can create and establish control over an identifier in a manner that is independent, interoperable, and portable without recourse to any central authority. Autonomic identity systems rely solely on self-sovereign authority.
</p>

<p>
    Alice can create as many Peer DIDs as she needs, each pointing to a public key that Alice controls. Alice can rotate the keys underneath the Peer DID anytime without impacting the identifier or her ability to prove she controls it. She keeps track of these key events in a key event log. The key event log is a chain of signed change records that can be cryptographically verified. Alice can use it to prove the provenance of her control of the identifier from its inception to the present.
</p>

<a></a>
 Peer DID Exchange  

<p>
    Alice can exchange Peer DIDs with Bob to create a relationship. Because DIDs are associated with public keys, the exchange ensures that Alice and Bob have each other's public keys. They share key event logs (using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type">CRDT</a>) for each identifier. If either updates the keys associated with the DID, the other is informed of change.
</p>


	<a></a>
	Alice and Bob exchange Peer DIDs to create a relationship (click to enlarge)


<p>
    Having exchanged DIDs, Alice and Bob can now exchange signed and encrypted messages with each other using DIDComm. <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0005-didcomm">DIDComm is a messaging protocol</a> that rides on top of this Peer DID relationship.
</p>


	<a></a>
	Alice and Bob use DIDComm to exchange messages (click to enlarge)




<p>
    Alice and Bob are using digital wallets to store the keys (and manage their key event logs). The DIDComm messages are being exchanged using software agents that understand the DIDComm messaging protocol and use the keys in the wallet.
</p>

<p>
    Alice can have DID-based relationships with multiple people, organizations, and even things. Each relationship includes a secure DIDComm-based messaging capability.
</p>


	<a></a>
	Some of Alice's Relationships (click to enlarge)


<p>
    This network of DID-based relationships forms an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlay_network">overlay network</a>. An overlay network comprises virtual links that correspond to a path in the underlying network. Secure overlay networks rely on an identity layer based on asymmetric key cryptography to ensure message integrity, non-repudiation, and confidentiality.
</p>

<p>
    DIDComm messaging has several important properties that, taken together, provide a generative, secure network overlay for the Internet.
</p>

 
     Secure - DID-based relationships are mutually authenticating. 
     Private - messages can be encrypted. 
     Interoperable - messages can be exchanged between any agents that support the DIDComm protocol. 
     Transport-agnostic - DIDComm does not rely on any specific network technology–it is as happy on Bluetooth as on TCP/IP or anything else. 
     Extensible - DIDComm is designed to support other protocols riding on top of its general secure messaging infrastructure. 
 

<a></a>
 Protocological Power 

<p>
    The extensibility of DIDComm is one of its most powerful features because it makes DIDComm generative–just like the Internet itself.
</p>
<p>
    Protocols describe the rules for a set of interactions, specifying the kinds of interactions that can happen without being overly prescriptive about their nature or content. Protocols formalize workflows for specific interactions like ordering food at a restaurant, playing a game, or applying for college.
</p>
<p>
    The <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs">Hyperledger Aries project has a collection of RFCs</a> that describe protocols for DIDComm messaging. While we have come to think of SSI agents being strictly about exchanging peer DIDs to create a connection, request and issue a credential, or prove things using credentials, these are merely specific protocols defined to run over the DIDComm messaging protocol. The follow specifications describe the protocols for these three core applications of DIDComm:
</p>

 
     <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0023-did-exchange/README.md">Connecting with others</a> 
     <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0036-issue-credential/README.md">Requesting and issuing credentials</a> 
     <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0037-present-proof/README.md">Proving things using credentials</a> 
 

<p>
    Dozens, even hundreds, of other protocols are possible.
</p>

<p>
    Daniel Hardman has provided a comprehensive tutorial on defining protocols on DIDComm. One of the Aries RFCs is sample protocol definition of a protocol for playing TicTacToe over DIDComm messaging.
</p>


	<a></a>
	Alice and Bob play Tic Tac Toe (click to enlarge)


<p>
    The TicTacToe protocol defines types of messages that are allowed, the game state, and what messages are allowed in each game state. I recommend it as a way to understand DIDComm protocols since it's familiar and easy to understand. Bruce Conrad who works on <a href="https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/overview?mode=global">picos</a> with me <a href="https://github.com/Picolab/TicTacToe/blob/master/README.md">implemented the TicTacToe protocol for picos</a>, which act as DIDComm agents.
</p>

<a></a>
 Generativity 

<p>
    In 2005, Jonathan Zittrain wrote a compelling and prescient examination of the generative capacity of the Internet and its tens of millions of attached PCs<a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/9385626/Zittrain_Generative%20Internet.pdf"></a>. Zittrain defined generativity thus:
</p>

<blockquote>Generativity denotes a technology's overall capacity to produce unprompted change driven by large, varied, and uncoordinated audiences.
     From <a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/9385626/Zittrain_Generative%20Internet.pdf">The Generative Internet</a><br>Referenced 2021-06-14T13:41:18-0600
     </blockquote>

<p>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_systems">Generative systems</a> use a few basic rules, structures, or features to yield behaviors that can be extremely varied and unpredictable. Zittrain goes on to lay out the criteria for evaluating the generativity of a technology:
</p>

<blockquote>
    Generativity is a function of a technology's capacity for leverage across a range of tasks, adaptability to a range of different tasks, ease of mastery, and accessibility.
</blockquote>

<p>
    I have <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/12/the_generative_self-sovereign_internet.shtml">made the case elsewhere that the self-sovereign internet meets Zittrain's criteria for generativity</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Generativity provides decentralized actors with the ability to create cooperating, complex structures and behavior. No one person or group can or will think of all the possible uses, but each is free to adapt the system to their own use. The architecture of the self-sovereign internet enables adaptation of DIDComm messaging to any circumstance.
</p>

<p>
    I am bullish on the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/01/generative_identity.shtml">possibilities for verifiable credentials</a> to allow people to live digital lives with dignity and effectiveness, addresses the problems of social inclusion, and support economic equality to everyone around the globe. With all that, I believe the possibilities for the self-sovereign internet are even larger, promising a more secure and private, albeit no less useful, internet for tomorrow. DIDComm may turn out to be the most important part of self-sovereign identity.

<p>Not so fast. Let’s start with losing access to my accounts. Maybe I forgot my

e-mail but my primary e-mail account was hacked, and now the attacker controls my
Facebook account and I don’t. Maybe Google decided to disable my account, and given
that there is no appeals process, that’s the end of me and my e-mail. The end
of a 20-year-long record of all important things I wrote to others and they wrote

<p>But even if everything is fine, and I don’t forget my passwords and don’t get
hacked and won’t get locked out: it’s a bit like being a really unimportant guest
living in a fancy hotel on a short-term lease. They can kick me out any time, and
keep all my furniture and other possessions, no questions asked. Thank you, I
prefer my very own home, where nobody can kick me out, or at least renter
protection laws, which don’t exist online.</p>

Illustration: Digital Identity&nbsp;Wallet<p>This article explains what a wallet is, how it works and how you can use it for managing your digital identity. While there are also wallets for institutions, this article only focuses on wallets for end users. The article also takes into consideration the revised eIDAS regulation including the ‘European Digital Identity&nbsp;Wallet’.</p> An Introduction <p>A digital wallet is a key management application, which provides a user with a graphical interface to store, manage and secure digital keys. These keys can be used to sign transactions, statements, credentials, documents or&nbsp;claims.</p><p>A digital identity wallet enables a user to establish relationships and interact with third parties in a trusted manner. While the wallet aspect is mainly dealing with key management, storage aspects and the graphical interface (UI = User Interface), the third party interactions are rather organised by your agent, which is a part of your wallet. Your agent handles third-party interactions in your name and acts in your interest. It is a piece of software, which helps you to stay in control of your messaging, security, health records, privacy, purchases etc.</p> A digital identity wallet based on self-sovereign identity (SSI) principles. <p>Not all wallets are the same! A wallet is a piece of technology, which can be implemented in different ways. While it can leverage decentralised identifiers (DIDs) and verified credentials, it doesn’t necessarily need to follow the principles of SSI. There are cloud wallets, which are hosted and provided by a third party. A good comparison is a wallet for cryptocurrencies — think of an exchange like Coinbase or Binance. These companies offer you a hosted wallet, which you don’t control. You might have the authentication means (password + second factor) to access your wallet, but it’s not yours. In this case, you are the owner, but not the possessor and you don’t have data sovereignty. This is in stark contrast to so-called self-custody wallets, which you install on your device. These wallets randomly create a private key, which only you know. The key point is that your wallet creates keys for you, which only you know and not a third&nbsp;party.</p><p>A digital identity wallet, which follows the <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">principles of SSI </a>enables the user to have data sovereignty and complete control as well as data portability. It provides you with the necessary autonomy to be independent of a third party. It not only enables ownership but also possession. It enables transparency and explicit consent when sharing information. It’s also vendor-independent, meaning you can export your data and import it into another wallet of your choice since it is built on open standards, which are widely used. It also creates peer identifiers for every new contact or rather an interaction, instead of getting an identifier assigned to&nbsp;it.</p> The core functions of an SSI&nbsp;wallet <p>Please note that the described characteristics below are not universally valid for all (SSI) wallets. It’s rather a desired&nbsp;status.</p>Interactions in an SSI ecosystem, picture by Adrian Doerk from&nbsp;Lissi.<p>Establish trusted relationships with third parties:<br>The wallet can create an encrypted communication channel to exchange information between you and a (trusted) third party. This communication channel is based on a unique identifier, which you control. Hence it is not hosted by a third party. This in turn enables you the portability of communication channels. Meaning if you switch from one wallet to another you can use the communication channels, which you already created without the reliance on any third-party platform.</p><p>Store, organise and present verified data:<br>The user can store and manage (verified) credentials among other information within the wallet. Once in the wallet, credentials can be used to answer a proof request from every connection. The wallet creates a verifiable presentation, which the user can choose to send or instead decline the proof request. Users are also able to verify the identity of the other party, effectively establishing a trusted relationship, which can be leveraged to share and receive information within a defined trust framework such as the eIDAS regulation. This trust might be based on an electronic seal or similar trust mechanisms. However, this might not be the case for all contacts.</p><p>The information exchanged can be verified, but can also be self-attested or just proof a certain threshold without revealing the exact information like your age when proofing you are 18 or&nbsp;older.</p><p>A transparent history of shared data:<br>Since the wallet usually keeps a history of interactions, the user can track who shared what data and when. This leads to greater transparency for the user and helps to better exercise data protection rights. A framework for the integration of detailed consent forms is currently under development.</p> Self-custody: With great control comes great responsibility <p>These digital wallets run locally as an application on the device of the user. From a technical perspective, these wallets are similar to self-custody wallets for cryptocurrencies. Similar to these wallets the user has the responsibility to do a&nbsp;backup.</p><p>Identification, authentication and authorization:<br>Before diving deeper into the core functions of a digital wallet we need to understand the differences between the three words above. The questions are from the perspective of the verifier or&nbsp;issuer.</p><p>Identification answers the question: “Who is I’m talking to?”<br>Authentication answers the question: “Is it you (whom I’ve identified already) again?”<br>Authorization answers the question: “What rights do I want to grant&nbsp;you?”</p><p>The wallet can enable a variety of additional functions and thus serves as a central point for the user to manage and access services. For example, the wallet can be used to replace traditional authentication methods such as passwords with a single sign-on (SSO) functionality. Furthermore, existing standards such as the OpenID Connect protocol can also be connected to enable communication with existing infrastructure. Hence, once widespread adopted the wallet will completely replace passwords for you and enable you to identify and authenticate yourself, identity third-parties as well as authorise third-parties to use your data according to your permissions.</p> The European Digital Identity&nbsp;Wallet Illustration: European Digital Identity&nbsp;Wallet<p>The main regulation within the European Union, which addresses the topic of identification (among other topics) is the regulation on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market better known as eIDAS regulation. The regulation just went through a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-digital-identity">major revision and now includes several aspects regarding self-sovereign identities</a> in its draft version. It also includes the aspect of a European Digital Identity Wallet, which “is a product and service that allows the user to store identity data, credentials and attributes linked to her/his identity, to provide them to relying parties on request and to use them for authentication, online and offline, for a service in accordance with Article 6a; and to create qualified electronic signatures and&nbsp;seals”.</p><p>In the following, the European Digital Identity Wallet is referred to as “EU Wallet” for simplicity.</p> Functions of the EU&nbsp;Wallet: <p>It should technically enable the selective disclosure of attributes to relying parties. Member States should also reach an agreement on common elements of a business model and fee structure of the EU Wallets. The EU Wallet will furthermore enable citizens to create qualified electronic signatures that can facilitate political participation among other functions.</p> EU Wallets shall enable the user&nbsp;to:   securely request and obtain, store, select, combine and share, in a manner that is transparent to and traceable by the user, the necessary legal personal identification data and electronic attestation of attributes to authenticate online and offline to use online public and private services;  sign statements or contracts utilising qualified electronic signatures (QES)  have full control of the EU Wallet. The issuer of the EU Wallet shall not collect information about the use of the EU Wallet which are not necessary for the provision of the EU Wallet&nbsp;service.  use it free of charge (natural persons).  access the wallet for persons with disabilities.   The EU Wallets shall provide a common interface:   to qualified and non-qualified trust service providers issuing qualified and non-qualified electronic attestations of attributes.  for relying parties to request and validate personal identification data and electronic attestations of attributes.  for the presentation to relying parties of personal identification data, electronic attestation of attributes or other data such as credentials, in local mode not requiring internet access for the&nbsp;wallet.   Furthermore, the EU Wallets need&nbsp;to:   ensure that trust service providers of qualified attestations of attributes cannot receive any information about the use of these attributes.  meet the requirements in regards to assurance level “high”, in particular as applied to the requirements for identity proofing and verification, and electronic identification means management and authentication.  provide a mechanism to ensure that the relying party is able to authenticate the user and to receive electronic attestations of attributes;  ensure that the personal identification data uniquely and persistently represent the natural or legal person is associated with&nbsp;it.   An EU Wallet shall be&nbsp;issued: <p>(a) by a Member State;<br>(b) under a mandate from a Member State;<br>(c) independently but recognised by a Member&nbsp;State.</p><p>The draft regulation requires Member States to issue a EU Wallet under a notified eID scheme to common technical standards following a compulsory compliance assessment and voluntary certification within the European cybersecurity certification framework, as established by the Cybersecurity Act.</p><p>Service providers should communicate their intent to rely on the EU Wallets to the Member States. Relying on the level of assurance “high”, the EU Wallets should benefit from the potential offered by tamper-proof solutions such as secure elements.</p><p>The conformity of EU Wallets should be certified by accredited public or private sector bodies designated by Member States. Certification should in particular rely on the relevant European cybersecurity certifications schemes. The EU Wallet Trust Mark’ means an indication in a simple, recognisable and clear manner that a EU Wallet has been issued in accordance with this Regulation.</p><p>The Commission shall establish, publish and maintain a list of certified European Digital Identity&nbsp;Wallets.</p> Where are heading? A personal&nbsp;opinion:   A wallet acts as a central point to manage interactions in a digital world. It will be the standard for identity management and be ubiquitous in everyday&nbsp;life.  Technology is moving fast. While standardisation is taking quite a while, institutions and governments have recognised the need for innovation in this area to secure data sovereignty and not be dependent on a foreign oligopoly of companies with irresponsible business practices.  Dozens of use-cases from different industries are explored in parallel and will be available in the upcoming&nbsp;months.  Over time digital wallets for pure identity management and financial applications (e.g. cryptocurrencies or central bank digital currencies (CBDC)) are likely to&nbsp;merge.  The draft of the revised eIDAS regulation of the European Union is the most comprehensive and ambitious step towards SSI internationally.  While the exact implementation and technical specifications of the EU Wallets are still to be determined, their compulsory issuance for the EU Member States as well as the compulsory acceptance for big platform providers will have a tremendous international impact.  Key management is an issue, which still needs to be solved. This means, the user also has the responsibility of having a secure backup solution to restore the wallet in case of lost&nbsp;access.

<p>Since I’m&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/vrm/2020/10/26/blue/">done </a>with fighting in the <a href="https://www.blueoceanstrategy.com/what-are-red-blue-oceans/">red ocean</a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism">surveillance-dominated</a> Web, I’ve decided, while busy <a href="https://customercommons.org/a-new-way/">working</a> in the blue ocean (on what for now we’re calling <a href="https://customercommons.org/the-dawn-of-i-commerce/">i-commerce</a>), to bring back, in this blog, some of the hundreds of things I’ve written over the last 30+ years. I’m calling it the Redux series. To qualify, these should still ring true today, or at least provide some history. This early one is still on the Web, <a href="http://buzzphraser.com/buzzstory.html">here</a> at <a href="http://buzzphraser.com/">BuzzPhraser.com</a>. I’ve made only two small edits, regarding dates. (And thanks to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/denisecaruso">Denise Caruso</a> for reminding me that this thing started out on paper, very long ago.)</p>
 
<p><a href="http://buzzphraser.com/"></a></p>
<p>The original <a href="http://buzzphraser.com/">BuzzPhraser</a> was created in 1990, or perhaps earlier, as a spreadsheet, then a HyperCard stack; and it quickly became one of the most-downloaded files on AOL and Compuserve. For years after that it languished, mostly because I didn’t want to re-write the software. But when the Web came along, I knew I had to find a way to re-create it. The means didn’t find that end, however, until&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thedance.net/">Charles Roth</a>&nbsp;grabbed the buzzwords by their serifs and made it happen, using a bit of clever Javascript. Once you start having fun with the new BuzzPhraser, I’m sure you’ll thank him as much as I do.</p>
<p>The story that follows was written for the original BuzzPhraser. I thought it would be fun to publish it unchanged.</p>
<p>—Doc, sometime in the late ’90s</p>
<p>BuzzPhrases are built with TechnoLatin, a non-language that replaces plain English nouns with vague but precise-sounding substitutes.&nbsp; In TechnoLatin, a disk drive is a “data management solution.”&nbsp; A network is a “workgroup productivity platform.”&nbsp; A phone is a “telecommunications device”.</p>
<p>The virtue of TechnoLatin is that it describes just about anything technical.&nbsp; The vice of TechnoLatin is that it really doesn’t mean anything.&nbsp; This is because TechnoLatin is comprised of words that are either meaningless or have been reduced to that state by frequent use.&nbsp; Like the blank tiles in Scrabble, you can put them anywhere, but they have no value.&nbsp; The real value of TechnoLatin is that it&nbsp;sounds&nbsp;precise while what it says is vague as air.&nbsp; And as easily inflated.</p>
<p>Thanks to TechnoLatin, today’s technology companies no longer make chips, boards, computers, monitors or printers.&nbsp; They don’t even make products.&nbsp; Today everybody makes “solutions” that are described as “interoperable,” “committed,” “architected,” “seamless” or whatever.&nbsp; While these words sound specific, they describe almost nothing.&nbsp; But where they fail as description they succeed as camouflage: they conceal meaning, vanish into surroundings and tend to go unnoticed.</p>
<p>Take the most over-used word in TechnoLatin today: solution.&nbsp; What the hell does “solution” really mean?&nbsp; Well, if you lift the camouflage, you see it usually means “product.”&nbsp; Try this: every time you run across “solution” in a technology context, substitute “product.”&nbsp; Note that the two are completely interchangeable.&nbsp; The difference is, “product” actually means something, while “solution” does not.&nbsp; In fact, the popularity of “solution” owes to its lack of specificity.&nbsp; While it presumably suggests the relief of some “problem,” it really serves only to distance what it labels from the most frightening risk of specificity: the clarity of actual limits.</p>
<p>The fact is, most vendors of technology products don’t like to admit that their creations are limited in any way.&nbsp; Surely, a new spreadsheet — the labor of many nerd/years — is something&nbsp;more&nbsp;than “just a spreadsheet.”&nbsp; But what?&nbsp; Lacking an available noun, it’s easy to build a suitable substitute with TechnoLatin.&nbsp; Call it an “executive information matrix.”&nbsp; Or a “productivity enhancement engine.”&nbsp; In all seriousness, many companies spend months at this exercise.&nbsp; Or even years.&nbsp; It’s incredible.</p>
<p>There is also a narcotic appeal to buzzphrasing in TechnoLatin.&nbsp; It makes the abuser feel as if he or she is really saying something, while in fact the practice only mystifies the listener or reader.&nbsp; And since buzzphrasing is so popular, it gives the abuser a soothing sense of conformity, like teenagers get when they speak slang.&nbsp; But, like slang, TechnoLatin feels better than it looks.&nbsp; In truth, it looks suspicious.&nbsp; And with good reason.&nbsp; TechnoLatin often does not mean what it says, because the elaborate buzzphrases it builds are still only approximations.</p>
<p>But who cares? Buzzphrasing is epidemic.&nbsp; You can’t get away from it.&nbsp; Everybody does it.&nbsp; There is one nice thing about Everybody, however: they’re a big market.</p>
<p>So, after studying this disease for many years, I decided, like any self-respecting doctor, to profit from the problem.&nbsp; And, like any self-respecting Silicon Valley entrepreneur, I decided to do this with a new product for which there was absolutely no proven need, in complete faith that people would buy it.&nbsp; Such is the nature of marketing in the technology business.</p>
<p>But, lacking the investment capital required to generate demand where none exists, I decided on a more generous approach: to give it away, in hope that even if I failed to halt the epidemic, at least I could get people to talk about it.</p>
<p>With this altruistic but slightly commercial goal in mind, I joined farces with Ray Miller of Turtlelips Services to create a product that would encourage and support the narcotic practice of buzzphrasing.&nbsp; Being the brilliant programmer he is, Ray hacked it into a stack in less time than it took for me to write this prose.&nbsp; And now here it is, free as flu, catching on all over the damn place.</p>
<p>What made BuzzPhraser possible as a product is that the practice of buzzphrasing actually has rules.&nbsp; Like English, TechnoLatin is built around nouns.&nbsp; It has adjectives to modify those nouns.&nbsp; And adverbs to modify the adjectives.&nbsp; It also has a class of nouns that modify other nouns — we call them “adnouns.”&nbsp; And it has a nice assortment of hyphenated prefixes and suffixes (such as “multi-” and “-driven”) that we call “hyphixes.”</p>
<p>Since the TechnoLatin lexicon is filled with meaningless words in all those categories, the words that comprise TechnoLatin buzzphrases can be assembled in just about any number or order, held together as if by velcro.&nbsp; These are the rules:</p>
 
 adverbs modify adjectives 
 adjectives modify adnouns, nouns or each other 
 adnouns modify nouns or other adnouns 
 nouns are modified by adnouns or adjectives 
 prefixes modify all adjectives 
 suffixes qualify all adnouns 
 
<p>Here is a diagram that shows how the rules work:</p>
<p></p>
<p>As with English, there are many exceptions.&nbsp; But, as with programming, we don’t make any.&nbsp; So cope with it.</p>
<p>With one adverb, one adjective, two adnouns, a noun and a prefix, you get “backwardly architected hyper-intelligent analysis inference leader.”&nbsp; With an adjective and two nouns, you get “interactive leverage module.”&nbsp; Put together buzzphrases of almost any shape and length:</p>
 
 “Breakthrough-capable technology market” 
 “Primarily distinguished optional contingency philosophy control power environment” 
 “Executive inference server” 
 “Evidently complete key business manipulation capacity method” 
 “Incrementally intelligent workgroup process topology vendor” 
 
<p>The amazing thing is that all of these sound, as we say in TechnoLatin, “virtually credible.”&nbsp; And one nice thing about the computer business is — thanks largely to the brain-softening results of prolonged TechnoLatin abuse — “virtually credible” is exactly what it means in plain English: close enough.</p>
<p>BuzzPhraser makes “close enough” easy to reach by substituting guesswork for thinking.&nbsp; Just keep hitting the button until the right buzzphrase comes along.&nbsp; Then use that buzzphrase in faith that at least it sounds like you know what you’re saying.&nbsp; And hey, in this business, isn’t that virtually credible?</p>

 This past week, the Colorado legislature passed the “Colorado Privacy Act”,
which makes Colorado the 3rd US state with modern privacy legislation,
following the CCPA in California
and the CDPA in Virginia.
It will start going into effect about 24 months from now. 
 Its provisions are similar to California’s and Virginia’s, except for

<p>This past week, the Colorado legislature passed the “Colorado Privacy Act”,
which makes Colorado the 3rd US state with modern privacy legislation,
following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Consumer_Privacy_Act">CCPA in California</a>
and the <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212+sum+HB2307">CDPA in Virginia</a>.
It will start going into effect about 24 months from now.</p>
<p>Its provisions are similar to California’s and Virginia’s, except for
this one, which goes substantially further:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A CONTROLLER THAT PROCESSES PERSONAL DATA FOR PURPOSES OF TARGETED ADVERTISING
OR THE SALE OF PERSONAL DATA SHALL ALLOW CONSUMERS TO EXERCISE THE RIGHT TO OPT
OUT OF THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING THE CONSUMER FOR
PURPOSES OF TARGETED ADVERTISING OR THE SALE OF PERSONAL DATA …
BY CONTROLLERS THROUGH A USER-SELECTED UNIVERSAL OPT-OUT MECHANISM THAT
MEETS THE TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS ESTABLISHED BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track">Do Not Track</a> – or
something very much like it – is back in Colorado, and ignoring the setting,
like companies did widely when Do Not Track was created, is not an option any more.
The technical details will need to be figured out between now and when this
provision goes into effect, which two and a half years away. So plenty of
time to get this right.</p>
<p>Progress! Which US state is next? The IAPP has a
<a href="https://iapp.org/media/pdf/resource_center/State_Comp_Privacy_Law.pdf">great chart</a> showing
the state of privacy legislation in states around the US.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-ed/">W3C VC-EDU</a> call on June 7, 2021 we discussed <a href="https://openbadges.org/">Open Badges</a> asserted as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a> (VCs). This call began the public discussion of Open Badges as Native VCs (potentially as Open Badges 3.0) to inform the IMS Open Badges Working Group. Why are we discussing this? Why does it matter? How will it work? Feedback from folks in the community have suggested that it would be helpful to answer these questions first from a conceptual standpoint. In a later post, we can outline what the structural changes could look&nbsp;like.</p><p>Open Badges are digital credentials that can recognize learning, achievements, and even memberships. They look like an image, but inside the image are metadata properties (it works much like how digital photos have metadata properties that explain the data of the photo, location, etc. so that when the photo is uploaded, applications understand the data). The metadata describes why the badge was issued, when, the recipient (typically an email address), the description and criteria of the achievement, and, critically, how this digital credential can be verified.</p><p>The verification of an Open Badge is dependent on the Issuer of the badge. It can be done in one of two&nbsp;ways:</p>  <a href="https://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/Badges/OBv2p0Final/index.html#HostedBadge">Hosted Verification</a> — One of the metadata properties of an Open Badges is the assertion id which is a URL that hosts the metadata in a&nbsp;.json file. If that URL can’t be found, then the badge is not verifiable  <a href="https://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/Badges/OBv2p0Final/index.html#SignedBadge">Signed Verification</a> — An Issuer can digitally sign the metadata of a badge. This uses cryptography to ensure that the badge data has not changed and that the issuer was the entity that issued the badge. The public key used to sign the badge must be traceable back to the&nbsp;issuer.  <p>Primarily, Open Badges platforms are issuing hosted badges. This means the verifying party is dependent on the issuer to host the data. Also, the issuer has some ability to track when the badge data has been accessed and potentially by who (or at least by IP address).</p><p>For 99% of the badges that have been issued to date, this is fine. In fact, badges are often shared via web pages that attractively display the image and data (not by the&nbsp;.json files that contain the data or the baked image with the data inside). So while Open Badges are both human readable and machine readable, the human readable approach is what is used most often. Signed badges are closer to Verifiable Credentials because they also rely on cryptographic proof.</p><p>Neither of these approaches give learners control of their data and this is the overall conceptual shift between Open Badges 2.0 and Open Badges as Verifiable Credentials.</p><p>Verifiable Credentials, like signed Open Badges, are signed by the issuer and verified cryptographically. Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) can be used to identify the issuer and recipient (using DIDs in Open Badges 2.0 has been prototyped). Also, Verifiable Credentials have a concept called “Presentations” which can be digitally signed by the recipient to prove that they are the recipient of the verifiable credential(s) being presented. All in all, this means that the issuer is verified and also the recipient.</p><p>Verifiable Credentials can be displayed, shared, and presented from wallet applications that are web, mobile, or desktop based (most are mobile right now). Recipients can present one or more of their credentials to verifying third-parties who can verify the credentials without depending on the issuers and consume the data. Not only can the participant manage which credentials are being verified, they can control what aspects of their data are being&nbsp;shared.</p><p>For example, a student’s digital wallet may contain a digital passport, an Open Badge representing a completed course, and an Open Badge representing a student ID (all as Verifiable Credentials). A relying third-party, such as a potential employer seeking to fill an internship role, may need to verify that a student is over 18, has completed a course on communication, and is a current student. The employer’s website application can ask the student to provide this discrete information using their wallet and the student can do this without revealing any of the other information in those credentials like their date of birth, address, photo, or even the name of the school they attend. And all of this information can be verified without contacting the issuers of those credentials. Open Badges 2.0 can’t do&nbsp;this.</p><p>Verifiable Credentials put learners in the center of a trust triangle with issuers and verifiers. They also add an additional layer of verification for the recipients. Open Badges can take advantage of this, be the first education-focused digital credential spec to promote personal protection of and access to data, and be part of the growing ecosystem that is exchanging Verifiable Credentials.</p><p>It’s worth noting that the human readable aspect of Open Badges would not change in a VC version. Issuers can still display web pages for the issued badges and allow recipients to share their badges online from those pages. The difference being that those web pages would not be reliant on for machine verification or consumption.</p><p>Join us for this continuing discussion in the next VC-EDU call this coming Monday June 14 (and most Mondays) at 8am PDT / 11am EDT / 4pm BST / 5pm CEST. This call is public and all are welcome to join.

<p>This article shows how integration tests could be implemented for an ASP.NET Core application which uses <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/providers/cosmos/">EF Core</a> and Azure <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/">Cosmos</a>. The database tests can be run locally or in an Azure DevOps build using the Azure Cosmos emulator. <a href="https://xunit.net/">XUnit </a>is used to implement the tests.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCoreEfCoreCosmosTesting">https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCoreEfCoreCosmosTesting</a></p>



<p>EF Core is used to the access Azure Cosmos database. An EF Core DbContext was created to access Cosmos. This is like any EF Core context, with the DBSet definitions as required. Some Cosmos specific definitions are added using the OnModelCreating method. See the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/providers/cosmos/#cosmos-specific-model-customization">Cosmos-specific model customization</a> for more details.</p>


   public class CosmosContext : DbContext
    {
        public CosmosContext(DbContextOptions&lt;CosmosContext&gt; options) 
          : base(options) { }

        public DbSet&lt;MyData&gt; MyData { get; set; }

        protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
        {
            modelBuilder.HasDefaultContainer("MyDataStore");

            modelBuilder.Entity&lt;MyData&gt;()
                .ToContainer("MyDataItems");

            modelBuilder.Entity&lt;MyData&gt;()
                .HasPartitionKey(o =&gt; o.PartitionKey);

            modelBuilder.Entity&lt;MyData&gt;()
                .Property(d =&gt; d.ETag)
                .IsETagConcurrency();
        }
    }
  


<p>The MyData class is is used to model the Cosmos documents. This has a PartitionKey and also an ETag which can be used for the Optimistic concurrency validation.</p>


  public class MyData
{
	public string Id { get; set; }
	public string PartitionKey { get; set; }
	public string Name { get; set; }
	public string Description { get; set; }
	public string ETag { get; set; }
}
  


<p>The MyDataService service class is used to access the context and implement some query logic as required. I like to keep this simple and not separate the specification of the queries from the the business or the Linq statements. This reduces the amount of code and keeps the data access, business simple and makes it easy to adapt.</p>


  public class MyDataService
{
	private CosmosContext _cosmosContext;

	public MyDataService(CosmosContext cosmosContext)
	{
		_cosmosContext = cosmosContext;
	}

	public void EnsureCreated()
	{
		_cosmosContext.Database.EnsureCreated();
	}

	public async Task CreateAsync(MyData myData)
	{
		await _cosmosContext.MyData.AddAsync(myData);
		await _cosmosContext.SaveChangesAsync(false);
	}

	public async Task&lt;MyData&gt; Get(string id)
	{
		return await _cosmosContext.MyData.FirstAsync(d =&gt; d.Id == id);
	}

	public async Task&lt;IList&lt;MyData&gt;&gt; NameContains(string name)
	{
		return await _cosmosContext.MyData
			.Where(d =&gt; d.Name.Contains(name)).ToListAsync();
	}
}
  


<p>The ConfigureServices method adds the services required to use EF Core and Cosmos DB. The services are used in a Razor page application, but this could be any web application, ASP.NET Core API or ASP.NET Core Blazor.</p>


  public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
        {
            services.AddDbContext&lt;CosmosContext&gt;(options =&gt;
            {
                options.UseCosmos(
                   "AccountEndpoint=https://localhost:8081/;AccountKey=C2y6yDjf5/R+ob0N8A7Cgv30VRDJIWEHLM+4QDU5DE2nQ9nDuVTqobD4b8mGGyPMbIZnqyMsEcaGQy67XIw/Jw==",
                    databaseName: "MyDataDb"
               );
            });

            services.AddScoped&lt;MyDataService&gt;();
            services.AddRazorPages();
        }
  


<p>The service needs to be tested. Instead of mocking away the database or using separate specifications classes as parameters, the service can be tested as one using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/local-emulator">Azure Cosmos emulator</a> and EF Core. We used the framework tools to test our code. An EF Core in-memory database could also be used instead of the Azure Cosmos emulator. We use the emulator for these tests. </p>



<p></p>



<p>The tests are setup to add the services to the IoC and build these. The code can be run and asserted as required. To start locally in dev, the Azure Cosmos emulator needs to be started first.</p>

<p>The integration tests can be run in the Azure DevOps CI. I used a yaml file to test this and added this to my Azure DevOps build. This was a little bit tricky to setup because I did not easily find any working docs. The Microsoft.Azure.CosmosDB.Emulator is installed and started using Powershell. Then the tests can be run. </p>

<p>You can add the yaml pipeline to your Azure DevOps build and it will run like the triggers are defined or the Azure DevOps policies.</p>







<p>This works good, but you have to be careful in preparing the tests and running in parallel. Implementing the tests like this means you have less code in your application and you can still fully test all your code. A disadvantage with this approach is that the tests take longer to run compared to unit tests without the emulator.</p>

<p>A simple technology invented by Bell Labs over 20 years ago (and widely used today) could have prevented the Colonial Pipeline attack.</p> <p></p> <p>In 1880, the French government awarded Alexander Graham Bell roughly the equivalent of $300K as a prize for inventing the telephone. He used the award to fund the research laboratory that became colloquially known as Bell Labs. If you’re not familiar with Bell Labs, you should be. In the 140+ years that followed, researchers at <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/">Bell Labs</a>invented radio astronomy, transistors, lasers, solar cells, information theory, and UNIX, just to name a few of the many accomplishments. Among the many prestigious <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/about/awards/">awards</a>granted to Bell Labs researchers are nine Nobel prizes and twenty-two IEEE Medals of Honor.</p> <p>In 1998, I joined <a href="https://about.att.com/sites/labs_research">AT&amp;T Labs</a>, which was a research group that the company retained when they spun out most of Bell Labs to Lucent Technologies in 1996. I was a Web Application developer; one of the least technical roles in the Labs. If I ever thought for a moment that I knew technology, I was quickly humbled when I built an app that tracked the Labs' actually importantprojects. The experience of working in the Labs stuck with me in the form of humility and curiosity. I accepted that I may never be the foremost expert in any given technology and I assumed the mindset of a forever student. Even today, I constantly question what I think I know because there are always holes in my knowledge or perspectives that I haven’t seen.</p> <p>1998 was the same year that researchers at AT&amp;T Labs were issued a patent (filed in 1995)  for what became known in our industry as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). As a Product Manager at a tech firm, I don’t review patents for legal reasons. But I recently saw an excerpt of the abstract for the AT&amp;T patent and there was one line that I found entertaining: “A preferred method of alerting the customer and receiving a confirmation to authorize the transaction back from the customer is illustratively afforded by conventional two-way pagers.” Not much has changed in 23 years. Pagers have been largely replaced by SMS but text messaging through the telecom provider’s network remains one of the most popular delivery mechanisms for MFA (despite some <a href="https://www.nist.gov/blogs/cybersecurity-insights/questionsand-buzz-surrounding-draft-nist-special-publication-800-63-3">potential security flaws</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>I have no personal insight into AT&amp;T’s motivations at the time, but I read Kevin Mitnick’s book a few years ago (<a href="https://www.mitnicksecurity.com/ghost-in-the-wires">Ghost in the Wires</a>) and can’t help but wonder if AT&amp;T was at the forefront of developing security technologies because they were such a target of hackers for so many years. I also reached out to Steve Greenspan, one of the inventors named in the patent to get his thoughts on the project. He noted:<br></p><p>"Two-way pagers had just come out (1994-1995), and our cybersecurity  friends were debating whether quantum computing would undermine  password-based security. The goal was to explore business applications for  two-way pagers and to put humans in-the-loop for secure access." <br></p><p>Quantum computing is a a pretty interesting business driver for MFA, especially in the mid-1990's. The concern is even more relevant today as we inch closer to quantum compute becoming a practical reality. Today's authentication systems should store password data in non-reversible hashes (theoretically preventing the quantum threat), but it's clear that credentials are being stolen all the time (often via large databases that are just left unprotected) and MFA remains a top solution to mitigate the damage. Steve and team were clearly on the right track when they dreamed up out-of-band authentication and deserve some credit and recognition for the foresight.<br></p>You may be wondering how this relates to the pipeline attack that led to fuel shortages across the U.S. East Coast. Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-04/hackers-breached-colonial-pipeline-using-compromised-password">reported</a>that the Colonial Pipeline, which is the largest fuel pipeline in the country, was taken down by a single compromised password. That should never happen given the variety of tools available to limit and control access, starting with MFA – a relatively simple solution that would likely have prevented the attack. The entry point to the system was a Virtual Private Network (VPN) account. If you’re using a VPN and expose anything sensitive inside the VPN, you should implement strong authentication that includes at least two authentication factors (something you know, something you have, something you are). These are widely available technologies that are very effective against lost or stolen credentials.    <p>Of course, authentication isn’t the end of the story. Today’s widely distributed and highly dynamic environments require multiple layers of security. We all know how popular email and phishing attacks have become. It only takes one person inside a network to open an email, click a link, or logon to a phishing site to give an adversary a foothold in the network. We have to assume that will happen and build layers of strong security between any one user and the potential targets.</p>   <p>To illustrate the point, here’s a quick example:</p>   <p>Grocery stores who sell small, high-value items have traditionally struggled with theft. (Ask me over a beer sometime about how I helped take down a recurring thief when I worked at a grocery store.) If the only answer was to authenticate users (check ID) on the way into the store, it wouldn't be enough. Once inside, someone can still pocket items and walk out without paying. If you walk into a grocery store today, you’ll see cameras in the healthcare aisle where small, expensive medications line the shelves. But that’s not enough either. Each item is also locked in an anti-theft device that’s removed at the register. And some items are found in a locked cabinet that requires employee assistance. Theft still happens, but each layer reduces the risk. Our IT environments are much more complicated in terms of the various pathways to theft and our responses to reduce risk typically require more than a few layers of security.</p>   <p>Sensitive data should only be stored in a secure area of the network with access controls and Least Privilege enforcement. Access should be limited to specific hosts or networks. Data should be encrypted (inside the file when possible - so if the file is stolen, the data is still unusable). There should be strong authentication to get into the network and monitoring of all activity. There should be alerts on unusual behavior and Data Loss Prevention (DLP) to evaluate the sensitivity of data moving across the network. The environment should be scanned regularly for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. And on and on. Any one of these security mechanisms alone is not enough. This multi-layered approach to security is critical in developing a strong security posture that minimizes risk.</p>   <p>We could argue about where to start or which security controls are most important. But, it seems like a no-brainer to implement MFA for employees accessing corporate data and applications. Microsoft, who deals with 300 million fraudulent sign-in attempts daily <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2019/08/20/one-simple-action-you-can-take-to-prevent-99-9-percent-of-account-attacks/">concluded</a>that “MFA can block over 99.9 percent of account compromise attacks.”That sounds about right. While targeted attacks have increased in prevalence, most attacks are not targeted at specific companies or individuals. Most start with automated scripting or broad-scale phishing attacks that span across potentially thousands of companies and/or millions of people at the same time. When a foothold is found (a script finds a vulnerability or an open port, a user enters credentials into the phishing site, etc.), the attack begins. Implementing a few simple security technologies like automated vulnerability scanning and MFA can prevent most attacks before they begin. Even if a sophisticated phishing attack succeeds despite MFA, the credentials will not be very useful beyond the initial session (which should be limited in scope by other controls).</p>   <p>No single technology will solve all cybersecurity problems. But, implementing MFA is low-cost, easy-to-implement, and highly effective. It may even make life easier for end-users. Password requirements can be loosened because there’s less risk associated with cracked passwords. And there are numerous implementations of passwordless authentication that, while they may not always meet the strict definition of MFA, provide similar (sometimes higher) levels of security as MFA without requiring a password. Combined with context-aware adaptive security (that verifies device, network, location, time-of-day, etc.), these passwordless authentication options may provide the right level of balance between security and user experience. At this point, this isn’t scare tactics or FUD. Attacks on National infrastructure or other high-profile targets can impact the lives of millions with a single execute command. MFA is an easy layer to add to improve security and it’s commonly included with authentication solutions, so there’s really no excuse. It’s time to get it done.</p>

<p>We lost my mother, Deborah Monas, on Sunday evening. I was giving her a head rub; my sister Hannah held her hands; my dad Oscar and her brother Steve were at her&nbsp;feet.</p><p>How is this possible? The world doesn’t feel&nbsp;real.</p><p>When I was a small child, we used to pull out the sofabed in our postgraduate student flat <a href="https://medium.com/doctor-who/sofabeds-snuggling-and-the-blinovitch-limitation-effect-4a1a7dcfb196">and watch Doctor Who together under a blanket</a>. What I would give for a TARDIS now: a way to correct the fabric of time and space. Clearly something is badly wrong with&nbsp;it.</p><p>I want to have something perfect to say, some beautiful encapsulation of who she was, but the truth is that nothing could be perfect enough. There’s no way to write a biography that isn’t an imperfect model. Nothing can adequately describe my beautiful mother: her overwhelming kindness, her sense of justice, her irreverence for tradition and institutions, the love that our house was always, always filled&nbsp;with.</p><p>I’ve written a lot about her health in this space. She had dyskeratosis congenita, which first expressed itself as pulmonary fibrosis. She fought it hard. When she began to use supplementary oxygen, my sister and I moved to California to be closer. The double lung transplant she received at UCSF gave us almost an extra decade of time with her, and it was a privilege to be by her side, with my dad and my sister, on this&nbsp;journey.</p><p>She loved reading, and both Hannah and I got to share those experiences with her. Hannah read to Ma for years: books by authors like Wade Davis, Octavia Butler, and Tommy Orange. Ma and I shared book recommendations; this year we read Caste and The Nickel Boys, among others. Even as it became harder to read in print, she picked up audiobooks, and kept going, recording what she’d read in a notebook she kept by her&nbsp;bed.</p><p>Years ago, we were gifted a Sunfish sailing boat by our family friend Pammy Biscoe. The two of them had sailed on it when they were much younger. Now it became her and my thing: she was happiest out on Waquoit Bay, our striped sails catching the wind just right. She called it a Whoosh. I’ll remember her in an infinity of ways, in an infinity of moments, but being out on the water with her, watching her smile as we picked up speed, is one I’ll treasure the&nbsp;most.</p><p>When my parents met, in Berkeley in the 1970s, she worked to fight for affirmative action and tenants’ rights. Her belief and support for progressive causes was an anchor throughout her life. We discovered this week that she had quietly made over 178 progressive donations last year alone, without any of us really knowing. A list of some of the causes she consistently supported follows at the end of this post; in lieu of flowers, we’re asking people to contribute if they have the&nbsp;means.</p><p>I want to honor her by furthering what she put into the world. The loving, non-conformist, irreverent, equity-minded spirit that she embodied.</p><p>As she lay in her hospital bed, we read Ma messages from people who loved her throughout her life. One, from Hannah’s friend Anita Hurrell, particularly sums up our collective childhood, and the sensibility I want to take forward in my own life, inspired by my mother. I’ll end by sharing it here, with kind permission.</p><p>Dearest Deb,</p><p>One time you drove us in the van to the seaside and we ate sandwiches with cucumber in them and I thought they tasted delicious and I felt this strong sense of deep content sitting with Hannah in the back listening to her singing and humming for the whole journey. I have no idea where we went, and in my head it was nowhere in England, but rather part of the big-hearted, loving, funny, relaxed, non-conformist world of your family in my childhood — full of your laughter and your enormous kindness. Sitting on the bench in your house in Marston I recall a moment of feeling complete certainty that your pirozhki were the yummiest food that had ever been made. Staying in Wheatley when my mum and dad had gone away we ate popcorn and I felt safe even though at the time I had lost Blue Bear. I remember calling you my second mummy. I’m not sure I was always a very nice kid and was probably very ungrateful then, but now I wish I could convey how I revere you, Oscar, Ben and Hannah in my thoughts and how lucky I feel to keep your example with me. I look back and see how talented Hannah already was then when we were so little and she could just sing and sing and draw in a magic way, how cool she was (her doll Manuela had beautiful black wild curly hair while I chose Charlotte with twee clothes and ridiculous ringlets), what a true feminist you were, how much of parenting you seemed to do much better than we do these days, how generous and homemade and fun and kind the world you and Oscar made&nbsp;was.</p><p>You are an asset to the universe. I will always love you very&nbsp;much.</p><p>Anita</p><p>Causes Ma consistently supported:</p><p><a href="https://www.aclu.org/">ACLU</a> — <a href="https://action.aclu.org/give/now">donate</a></p><p><a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/">Planned Parenthood</a> — <a href="http://www.weareplannedparenthoodaction.org/">donate</a></p><p><a href="https://www.turnoutpac.org/">Progressive Turnout Project</a> — <a href="https://www.turnoutpac.org/donate">donate</a></p><p><a href="https://www.prochoiceamerica.org/">NARAL Pro-Choice America</a> — <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/naral-pro-choice-america-2">donate</a></p><p><a href="https://314action.org/">314 Action Fund</a> — <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/314af_website">donate</a></p><p><a href="https://www.turnoutpac.org/stop-republicans/">Stop Republicans</a> — <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/ms_srg_fr_homepage">donate</a></p><p><a href="https://traindemocrats.org/">National Democratic Training Committee</a> — <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/webdonation">donate</a></p><p><a href="https://endcitizensunited.org/">End Citizens United</a> — <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/eculavaf">donate</a></p><p><a href="https://www.kqed.org/">KQED Public Media</a> — <a href="https://donate.kqed.org/donatetoday">donate</a></p><p><a href="https://squadvictoryfund.com/">The Squad Victory Fund</a> — <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/squad-victory">donate</a></p><p><a href="https://www.boldpac.com/">BOLD Democrats PAC</a> — <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/bold-homepage">donate</a></p><p><a href="https://www.nationalbailout.org/">National Bail Out</a> — <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/freeblackmamas">donate</a></p><p><a href="https://philarballo.com/">Phil Arballo for Congress (CA-22)</a> — <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/arballo-for-congress-1">donate</a></p><p><a href="https://scottsifton.com/home/">Scott Sifton for Senate (MO)</a> — <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/blu-sift-21q1-web">donate</a></p><p>Originally published at <a href="https://werd.io/2021/ma-1">https://werd.io</a> on June 9,&nbsp;2021.</p>

      <p>Whilst our ongoing agile iteration into information beings is never-ending, there are the first 100 days. But what to focus on? Well, that rose-tinted period of conflicting optimisation is what <a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo/">&lt;/Hello, CDO!&gt; </a>is all about. Maintaining sanity when all else has been lost to untested data assumptions is a different problem entirely.</p><p>On Day zero of being a #CDO, you have to be ready and prepared as a translator, interpreter and go-between. Yes, the essential “translation” of business needs into information requires identifying the appropriate data, the relevant analysis, and the correct interpretations, but that is not what I am talking about. There is a different translation to the appropriately modelled, described and analysed, data that offers the language to enable siloed departments in organisations to talk to each other.</p><p>The CDO must have translation skills to help other executives talk about what data means to them and that each party leaves with a common understanding. Exceptional executives can ensure that key concepts from one domain or department are appropriately translated into language and concepts in the other domain.</p><p>By example,</p>  Data in the language of the finance department has to do with how to position data revenue and costs in the activities in the finance team use. Getting the budget spent on data, algorithms and analysis into the proper R&amp;D tax claim, the capitalisation table and the correct allocation for depreciation take times. How and when should data revenue be recognised? How should the margin for data be calculated? It has nothing to do with what the data does. Understanding what KPI’s the CFO is tasked with and how you can help them be achieved makes for an excellent working relationship. If The CFO is tasked with improving the balance sheet, how you capitalise spending is critical.  Data in the language of the legal department is a focus on the contractual and regulatory obligations. Understanding what the General Council is responsible for is critical, as it has nothing to do with the value data creates for the organisation. If you want certain protections for data, data use and data sharing, working with the legal team to craft holistic on and offline terms that spread across all contracts is critical.  Data in the language of the marketing team can be about privacy persevering data sharing and trust, leading to additional brand value. Sitting down with the senior leadership team in marketing to understand their KPI and BSC can help you translate data into what they need to achieve their goals. It has nothing to do with the value of the data; how they use data is a different issue. However, the CDO must be on top of conflicts that arise with sales targets driven by incentives, KPI’s opt-in demands and contractual boundaries.  <p>Being the translator, interpreter and go-between form you like a bridge, but as already articulated, it means&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo/day-0-as-the-cdo-you-are-now-the-new-corporate-punch-bag-1cddc7713c87">you are also the new corporate punchbag.</a></p>  Note to the CEO  <p>The CDO must have translation skill to help your executives speak with other disciplines about data and enable each party to leave with a common understanding. All CDOs will find the language to translate business context into data-enabled initiatives and ensure that key concepts from one domain or department are appropriately translated into language and concepts in the other domain.</p><p>We focus on the skills to “translate business needs” into data and information needs during interviews and the recruitment cycle. This additional translator, interpreter and go-between skill in this article are the built-in skills for exceptional CDO’s. However, if there is someone already in the team with this strength, it is not essential, but it does create a better working culture. Should you need these skills, they must be proven to you before you offer the job, it is not one to learn on the job.</p>

    I remain curious about how I can make better or wiser decisions.&nbsp; I am sharing this as part of my journey as I unpack my own boundaries and models that prevent me from making better decisions. &nbsp; <br> Context <p>I have personally, and will always, dislike and distrust “traditional” hierarchy, probably because I perceived that the “power” wielded on me would never be available to me. &nbsp; I was always on the outside; it is the joy of neuro-diversity that you become aware at an early age that to fit in the system and structure, you have to align to it, which for me, had no natural alignment.&nbsp; You either fight to fit in, fight the system or create your own.&nbsp; For many fitting in is natural, for me it never happened, and I stupidly opted for creating my own.&nbsp; I rebelled against the system and structures as I could only see hierarchy as a method of control to something I did not align to - telling me to do things that made no sense.&nbsp; Write with your right hand as a lefty.</p><p>I am not alone; from Machiavelli to Second lieutenant Boris Drubetskoy in Tolstoy's War and Peace, many have realised that there are two structures of power.&nbsp; There is an obvious hierarchy of control, reporting and subordination, and there is a second unsaid and unwritten one of lobby and access.&nbsp; The obvious one is easy to rebel.&nbsp; The lobby and access inner ring is where true power rests; it is the one to try and join. However, it is invitation-only, and many will sacrifice more than they realise in terms of ethics, morals and beliefs to be at the table and remain part of it. When thinking about data, bias and decision making, the incentive to join and incentives when in the club is a critically important driver. This unsaid shadowy hierarchy creates outcomes we did not plan for as some will jeopardise judgment and trust to be rewarded.&nbsp; I would not align to this one either, and it was self-evident that you can only become a partner in a big firm when you have a big mortgage, depending on a big salary. The significant debt and dependence on salary provide leverage.&nbsp; The humour in “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes_Minister">Yes Minister</a>”, the 1980’s BBC&nbsp; political satire sitcom, exposed much of this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Why does this matter?&nbsp; We increasingly talk to the equality and diversity (race, gender and neuro) agendas at the board and in the senior leadership team, but it is increasingly evident that there is an inner circle, which means we are not making smarter or better decisions.&nbsp; The targets for transparency and equality are just that, a target.&nbsp; (says the white over 50 male!)</p><p>I appreciate that it is difficult to separate the two dependent and co-joined aspects of the hierarchy. One aspect represents power and control, which is realised in terms of budget, size, scope, authority, and political dominance. The second is how and where important decisions sit, but those who lobby may be outside of the insights that data now provides for complex decision making.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The separate but parallel structures have worked for a long time as the consequences of long term decisions and intergenerational outcomes were not rewarded or measured. ESG, climate and the brutality of our assault on our environment, coupled with data, means this is all changing, but those who gave everything to join the inner circle have an incentive to maintain the status quo for as long as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>What ghosts are in the system that means decisions we make, with the best intentions, do not create the outcomes we desire</p><p>Take a moment to reflect.&nbsp; Are there separate hierarchies in your experience, or are they the same thing? It matters today more than ever before as we now have to make long term decisions against the backdrop of our systems of short term incentives and rewards.&nbsp; The inner ring becomes blind to a structure that always gives the feel of power as their short term decisions are highly rewarded through immediate incentives, which means being in the club is valuable for the few.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This viewpoint is looking at these two hierarchies (formal and informal) but positioning where either can be in the shadow of the other. Why am I writing this because we appear to find short term incentive-driven decisions easy but struggle to make long term judgment?&nbsp; I do not doubt the integrity of leaders who want to make better long term decisions using data and be better ancestors but get frustrated that it does not work.&nbsp; There are likely ghosts from the old decision making and lobby hierarchy in our current heuristics that create outcomes that were not planned.&nbsp;</p><p>Note: The term “Shadow Hierarchy” is used in management textbooks to describe the difference between a formal published and public structure and the one that actually has power and decision making.&nbsp; Googling “The Shadow of Hierarchy” will lead you to the 2008 paper from Adrianne Heuritier and Dirk Lehmkuhl, which was part of an EU funded project looking at “<a href="http://www.eu-newgov.org/">new models of governance</a>.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br> Our past is not easy to face up to.&nbsp; <p>There appears to be a much longer story that starts when decisions, power and control were all united.&nbsp; Over the past 5000 years, we have become increasingly short term focused and separated the decision-making process for the long term from power and control based on the science of management incentive and short term goals. There is no doubt that the structure of economics, along with other biases, come to play.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; we have created data technology on top of complex relational dependencies that means signals that should become noise through the layers of analysis, in fact, become significant distracting “interruptions” at the board. Whilst in the old system, noise and signals were hidden by the informal lobby that prevented more thoughtful long term decision making based on data, today they (signals and noise) create paralysis at all levels in structures as everyone knows everything.</p><p>Should the head of a religious movement be leading planning for the next 100 years or focussing on if the budget is spent according to the plan this quarter?&nbsp; Should our political leaders face the daily news headlines and respond or ensure we are equipped to face a global pandemic? &nbsp; Should the head of state be allowed to focus on sustainability, climate and global concerns or defending their grandchildren’s choices? What makes noise and news dominate interruptions.&nbsp; In a joined power and decision hierarchy structure a long time ago, a few individuals could make those decisions and choices, and lobby worked.&nbsp; Today our hierarchies,&nbsp; analogous to decision making,&nbsp; have become paralysed, confused and ineffective as the volume of data and signals mixed with noise has risen to a level where our ability to know what is the right thing to do is broken. Currently, we have not transitioned to something that works. Indeed lobby has also failed as it has become increasingly linked to short term reward and incentives.</p><p>The figure below captures this concept on a two-axis chart of scale and impact.&nbsp; The bottom right being an idea, it has no scale and little impact.&nbsp; The top right is big government, global businesses, global NGO’s and charities, global religion and large scale movements. &nbsp; On the journey from the idea to scale, we either transition from our ability to make long term decisions to focus on a quarter by quarter reporting justifying the delta between actual and plan *or* hold onto inter-generational consequences. Risk, funding, capital and markets have a significant impact on the loss of that long term thinking, as the rewards for the players become aligned to short term incentives. Whilst the long term hierarchies become corrupted, the shadow hierarchy of lobby gives way to a different incentive and power game.&nbsp; Impact and scale create the same problems irrespective of the organisation; short-termism can be recognised and rewarded.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Joseph, as in the Bible story and multicoloured dream coat fame aka the Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber musical. It is one of the earlier written examples of man’s capability for longer-term planning.&nbsp; It was a 14-year cycle, so not long term; however, 7 years of abundance followed by 7 of famine. Grow, harvest, store and distribute later. 4,000 years on and a 14-year strategic planning cycle looks massive but still short compared to the famed 100 years plus China and Japanese plans. I may have rose-tinted glasses that we were once better at long-range forecasting, but this is a good piece from three world-leading experts “<a href="https://theconversation.com/is-humanity-doomed-because-we-cant-plan-for-the-long-term-three-experts-discuss-137943">is humanity, in fact, unable to successfully plan for the long-term future?</a>” &nbsp; In the context of our currently limiting systems - yes.&nbsp; We have to break the system. I smell revolution.</p> Complexity of relationships <p>No doubt, a small part of the issue with our inability to long-range plan is the management of the complexity in relationships.&nbsp; The web of collaborative relationships that we need to consider only ever gets more strained, detailed, involved, dependant, and unbalanced, as each party align to their incentives and rewards.&nbsp; Critically, the unbalanced nature of the relationship means it is increasingly difficult to predict outcomes and reactions. (search:&nbsp; emergent complex systems). Our commercial framing is explored in the figure below.</p><p></p><p>The shareholder has a dependency on the board to make a decision that supports their funding of the capital. In contrast, the directors are accountable and responsible for their decisions, including unlimited liability. Everyone now has a voice that can affect choices and actions.&nbsp; The Director/ regulator/ ecosystem axis is dominated by who has the accountability and responsibilities, which are different for each stakeholder in an ecosystem and are often driving in different directions because of Balanced ScoreCards (BSC), KPI’s, incentives and being in the club.&nbsp; OKR (objective and key results) are no better, and the difference between built vs operate is a false one for the long term.&nbsp; Building the wrong thing can be rewarded very well in OKR land.&nbsp;</p><p>Continuing around the model, there is a remarkably fluid relationship between the executive teams’ and the board, where the board depends on the exec team. Still, the exec team is accountable to the board.&nbsp; (The level of fluid varies by nation and company law.) The relationships between and with the customer are particularly misunderstood, but ultimately the law says the directors are held accountable. Each of the roles in the chain of relationships from shareholders to the executive team required individuals capable of dealing with complex judgement.&nbsp; However, this assumes that the first part of this viewpoint is null.&nbsp; Let’s expand.&nbsp;</p><p>We face three connected issues but not mutually exclusive because they are a team or part of an ecosystem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>Some individuals in positions of influence and power are part of the club or want to be in the club and therefore have incentives to be in the club and stay in the club.&nbsp; Their judgement and actions are aligned with being in the club incentives.</p>  <p>Some individuals have reached influence and power but cannot grasp the new mental models and skills for complex judgment.&nbsp; Their judgement and actions are aligned with their experience.</p>  <p>Some individuals can understand the complexity and seek to explain and justify decisions and actions.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Taking this thinking and plotting this on skills/ ability vs decision environment.</p><p></p><p>The diagram above shows a decreasing number of skilled individuals who can cope with complexity. This is because the training system is about effectiveness and efficiency and not about determining if you are doing the right thing (efficacy).&nbsp; Many arrive at senior roles and find they have to shift their mindsets; some do, and some don’t, but they both now have decision capacity.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, we know that systems that create inequality, insecurity, and unsustainable practices are not easily transformed.&nbsp; Think of our government and economy. We have a system where 95% of the world live meal by meal, day by day, week by week or month by month.&nbsp; An additional 4.99% can survive for 6 to 8 months on the available cash and funds. Less than 0.01% (80 Million) of the world’s population can plan for more than a year.&nbsp; When you have those few in power and lobby, will they ever need to vote for change?&nbsp; Worth following and reading Umair Haque; I love this <a href="https://eand.co/our-societies-are-failing-because-their-economies-are-broken-72bb3d378351">essay</a> “How the Economy is Designed to Keep You Poor and Powerless.”&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://opengovernance.net/the-laws-of-1-how-far-before-you-reach-a-revolution-49bbace4049b">The laws of 1% explore outcomes if we change everything by + or - 1% and what it means to human behaviours.</a></p> What do “ghosts in the system” look like?&nbsp; <p>Imagine you are at the fairground, and there is one of the stalls where you get to throw something to win a prize.&nbsp; In the UK, we have the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coconut_shy">Coconut Shy</a>. &nbsp; You pay to get three balls or bags, stand behind the line and throw them one at a time at your coconut of choice.&nbsp; Knock a coconut off, and you win it.&nbsp; A simple game of skill (apparently).&nbsp; However, when there is a ghost in the system, it is not so simple. You line up your ball on coconut number one (it is the biggest one) and throw it with all your skill.&nbsp; As the ball approaches, the coconut moves and your ball sails past. You line up ball 2, aiming again at the largest coconut (the biggest prize); this time, you miss, but coconut number 4 wobbles.&nbsp; Your last chance on this budget.&nbsp; Lining up coconut number one for the last time, you hit it, but it does not fall off, but coconut number 6 does, the smallest one. &nbsp; The ghosts win. &nbsp; Your decisions and outcome was coconut number 1; you got number 6.&nbsp; It was not your lack of skill; coconut number 1 is glued on. Different motivations and rewards.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p> The ghosts make signals and noise.&nbsp; <p>This viewpoint started from hierarchy, and I want to return to thinking about the two hierarchies, one of decision and one of power and unpack the issues that the abundance of data has created for us.&nbsp; The diagram below sits with the idea that there is a natural order of decision making and power.&nbsp; The movement from the bottom to the peak is a move in the decision time horizon.&nbsp; Overlaid on this model is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility,_uncertainty,_complexity_and_ambiguity">VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous)</a> situations. VUCA came from preparing/ training the solder who would have to face a situation where they had to decide.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>The hierarchy is worth a paragraph to unpack, as the context of VUCA is situational.&nbsp; Front line workers are trained to be reactive. They know how to act based not on scenario but based on the situation (police, army, emergency, fire, medical, call centre, customer-facing representatives).&nbsp; How they react is one of the rules, heuristics and repeated numerous times.&nbsp; As the NIKE brand says - “just do it”, which is what you can do when you have trained to do the same thing for 10,000 hours - you don’t have to think it is a reaction.&nbsp; Above this line is the management who ensure the environment the workers have has the lowest possible risk.&nbsp; Above them is management, who think about “how do we adapt to new situations and threats?” Above them is the strategy layer, which considers “what skills do we need for the next five years, where are the gaps, and how do we access the skills.” &nbsp; For most companies, this takes us to the CEO.&nbsp; However, in public operations, there are two more layers. The transformational one is thinking about the infrastructure for the next twenty years and, finally, the policymakers.&nbsp; The policy leadership should be thinking 50 years hence and considering what policy we will need to form and how. Even at this simple layering, we can see that global leaders from presidents, prime ministers, and heads of state struggle to plan for 5 years yet are tasked with 50.&nbsp; We are not 10 x better; we have created a system 10 times worse.&nbsp;</p><p>What we should be witnessing is that one layers signal is another layers noise.&nbsp; Each layer takes all the signal from below that becomes their noise but detects new signals that they work to.&nbsp; An upward flow - not downward instruction.&nbsp; As the figure below shows, each layer has to apply different skills to find the signals needed to do their role.&nbsp; Interestingly, the lowest layers have the most operations discretion as they are exposed to the highest operational risks.&nbsp; Most diversity is welcome, but not from those who cannot do the same thing every time.&nbsp; Innovation may not be your friend in the depths.&nbsp; The strategy layer has peak decision discretion. Innovation is critical, and so is all diversity is critical. At the pinnacle is policy discretion, where is the least personal risk and whilst diversity is essential but so is adherence to a north star and single vision - so less diversity might help.&nbsp; Diversity is about situational improvement in decision making for better outcomes.&nbsp; Ouch.</p><p></p><p>However, this is not what we are witnessing right now - the above is theoretical rubbish.&nbsp; What we are feeling is summed up in the diagram below.&nbsp; There is are signals from the bottom, creating signals at the top, every layer adding more signals and noise.&nbsp; VUCA has gone from situational layers to the entire organisation, where everyone is reacting to everything.&nbsp; The ghosts of old processes and previous decisions are no longer limited to a layer, but everyone owns everything and has to react and understand. To repeat a previous line.&nbsp; Today our hierarchies,&nbsp; analogous to decision making,&nbsp; have become paralysed, confused and ineffective as the volume of data and signals mixed with noise has risen to a level where our ability to know what is the right thing to do is broken. Currently, we have not transitioned to something that works.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>The observation took time, but the question for us all is, do we believe it, and if so, what can we do?&nbsp; Do you believe it should be reflected on within the context of being in the club and how much you have already compromised on?&nbsp; Our Millenials are not in the club and will not compromise, ask them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Our stability has vanished, and our tools have broken. <p>Even to a casual observer, we live in turbulent times, which is seen through an increase in VUCA. The difficultly facing boards who carry responsibility for their decisions cannot be overstated.&nbsp; We have to deal with the ghosts of the past, the voice of the present and the spirits of the future.&nbsp; The diagram below brings out some of the tensions and conflicts being faced as we struggle to determine what we are optimising for.&nbsp; The two-axis are communication (said and unsaid) and status (know and unknown).&nbsp; The unsaid is that which is not written or spoken and assumed, often to avoid more conflict.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We have to deal with the ghosts of the past, the voice of the present and the spirits of the future.</p><p>Top right (said and known) This is the day to day operational aspects of the board and senior leadership team. There are two camps (supporter and action owner) at the board with 10 people involved in decision making. The focus is on management, KPI’s BSC and reporting.&nbsp; There are known status with data, and everyone is able and capable of engagement in the topics. We are married to this quadrant as it is easy and pays the remuneration, and we are incentivised to focus on it.&nbsp; This quadrant has traditionally depended on stability, but with VUCA disrupting that and the volume to signal and noise - we have to spend all our time here as that is all we have time for.</p><p></p><p>The bottom right is said and unknown.&nbsp; In this situation, everyone has a view about the unknown resulting in 10 camps (personal opinions and experience) with the 10 people.&nbsp; However, communication tends to be frank and honest. We go to this quadrant every now and again but quickly withdraw to safer grounds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The known and unsaid, top left.&nbsp; The unsaid here are the assumptions that we all make about everyone else in the room and their viewpoints.&nbsp; This time there is are 100 camps as we all assume about what everyone else thinks about everyone as there is no communication.&nbsp; The principal reasons not to communicate is conflict, dominance and leadership style.&nbsp; We are trapped by the debt we have (mortgage, credit, school fees, lifestyle, divorce) and need the salary; therefore, there is a degree of control.&nbsp; We try to avoid this quadrant but every now and then, we end up there because of other stress, pressures and the need for a diversion or win a political game.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The bottom left, the unknown and unsaid.&nbsp; The ecosystem has a voice, the partners of the directors have a voice, everyone has a voice, and many, due to previous flights and allegiances, are in several camps at the same time.&nbsp; The crux is that we are human and bring our differences, but it is very messy because it is unknown and unsaid. But this quadrant represents the volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity we are currently facing, and we don’t have the tools to deal with it. We have a preference based on skills, experience and incentives to focus on the top right.&nbsp;</p> Our processes and methods enable only certain decisions <p>One critical aspect of being in a leadership capacity is to question and determine how our processes and methods guide and frame certain decisions, which means we have to unpack legacy and find the ghosts in the system.</p><p>Legacy within this framing is threefold. Decisions. Decisions. Decisions. These are:</p>  <p>Previous incentives and power games created decisions that created processes, methods and rules; they are now ghosts in the systems. These decisions were taken so long ago that no one knows why, how or when it was decided. It is the way we do it; it is our IP, our brand.</p>  <p>Decisions that created “information and technology debt” included embedded and baked-in systems, hidden and no-longer supported code, and automation based on tools and data biased when created.</p>  <p>Decisions that created noise in the hierarchy to lose or filter signals that someone did not want to hear. It was the creation of layers, reports, practices, structural regulation and unchallenged assumptions.</p>  <p>Unpacking legacy questions will take time. It is worth asking questions about legacy when you are new to a company and then verifying them over time as we become blind to the tools that mould us.</p><p>I am focused on this because I want to determine how I can make smarter/ better decisions with data. For that, I need a data decision framework.&nbsp; Therefore I tend to ask what one thing do we as a leadership team want from our data? The response varies but include:</p>  <p>Evidence-based, actionable insights</p>  <p>What should we automate?</p>  <p>How do we know we are doing the right thing?</p>  <p>Where are there efficiencies to be gained?</p>  <p>What do customers really want?</p>  <p>How to manipulate customers to increase margin and revenues?</p>  <p>Where are risks that we cannot see?</p>  <p>What is being hidden that we cannot see?</p>  <p>If you look at this list in the context of what tools and decisions already frame the response, are these what we are looking for data to answer or are we looking to data to affirm/ justify what we have already decided. A different response that no one will say “to justify what we are already doing!”&nbsp; This fits into the know/ unsaid in the previous matrix. The top left, the one we avoid opening up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Data has bias because of previous decisions.&nbsp; Or we can write, “the ghost of previous decisions will guide our current decisions”.&nbsp; Importantly, our data, which we trust, is only the representation of the past, which means our tools fail.</p><p>Therefore, as a leadership team, we have to find non-data tools to check what decisions from the past are biasing the current data, processes and tools. We cannot usefully answer the question we have set ourselves “What is the one thing that we, as a team and organisation what our data to drive, deliver or provide? Without understanding the situation.</p><p>The CTO knows that they have to build a new platform when the bug list, new feature development and maintenance costs are bigger and will take more time than developing a new platform — this is the technology debt question. The CIO or newly created #CDO role has to understand what is your information debt. The CTO will struggle as there is no clear path from policy to code. Similarly, the CIO/CDO struggles with no clear path from policy (what one thing) to better data for the decisions we require. The data leadership team inherit and are now accountable for previous ghosts and decisions, which constrain what is now possible as the biased tool has created what we have. The costs of collecting, labelling, holding, sorting and creating training data continually increase, creating a more significant gap and misalignment in values and expectations from data.</p><p>“We become what we behold. We shape our tools, and then our tools shape us” is often mistakenly attributed to Marshall McLuhan and called McLuhan Law. The quote was actually written by Father John Culkin, SJ, a Professor of Communication at Fordham University in New York and friend of McLuhan. Such is the problem with data.</p><p>As we have separate decisions, power and now data, perhaps we should reflect on these questions as a leadership team.</p>  <p>What do we want to become, and what tools and data will help us?</p>  <p>What tools do we use, and what will they enable us to become?</p>  <p>What is the minimum viable data set required to give the best value?</p>  <p>Do our tools and data trap us?</p>  <p>Is the work of data to “detect and measure” or to “enables change and transform?”&nbsp;</p> <br>

    What happens when we decrease life support by 1%  <p>Taking water down by 1% per day once you pass a threshold of low water intake and death is a certainty in the short term (blue line).&nbsp; Taking food down by 1% per day, once you pass a threshold, death is a certainty, but it is slower to take you from life than reducing water (green line). Taking lifestyle or experience down by 1% per day gets more challenging and more complex, and you will likely die earlier, but death is not facing you (black line).&nbsp; We all die, but lack of water means it happens now, lack of food means it happens soon, lack of lifestyle means life could have been longer (black line).&nbsp; Leaving purple as the optimal.</p><p></p><p>When reducing water by 1%, you reach a point very quickly where revolution is worth it as there is nothing to lose. &nbsp; When reducing food by 1%, you reach a point slowly where revolution is worth it as there is less to lose. Still, if you go too far beyond the point when you have agency and capacity from sufficient food, you lose the ability to win the revolution.

<p>I used a Lisp variant in my first programming job, so I have some appreciation for the “code as data” power of that language. Nowadays I’m building an analytics system that combines Postgres and two of its procedural languages, pl/pgsql and pl/python, with a sense-making tool called <a href="https://metabase.com">Metabase</a> that’s written in a Lisp variant called <a href="https://clojure.org">Clojure</a>.</p>
<p>In Postgres I’m able to wrap SQL queries in functions; they compose with other functions that do things like cache results in materialized views and aggregate subgroups. It all feels very dynamic and functional, which are two of Clojure’s main calling cards, so this makes me wonder about Clojure as another Postgres procedural language.</p>
<p>For the pl/python functions in my system, “code as data” looks like building SQL statements that swap variables into SQL templates and combine them. This string-building approach is an anti-pattern for Clojure folk. They don’t want to work with fragments of SQL text, they want to work with Clojure maps. Here’s an example from <a href="https://github.com/musab/honeysql">Honey SQL</a>, the library that Metabase uses to build SQL texts from structured data.</p>
<p><code>(def sqlmap {:select [:a :b :c]<br>
:from   [:foo]<br>
:where  [:= :f.a "baz"]})<br>
</code></p>
<p>This seems like an important power to be able to wield in the hybrid programming environment that Postgres provides. I can imagine making very good use of it.</p>
<p>But I know very little yet about Clojure. Is this really an idea worth exploring? How else would it differ from what I’m now able to do in Python? To learn more about Clojure I’ve been watching talks by its creator, Rich Hickey. Most are tech-heavy but one of them isn’t like the others. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc">Hammock-driven development</a> he lays out a process for creative problem solving that coordinates the waking mind (at the computer doing critical thinking and analysis) with the background mind (on the hammock doing abstraction, analogy, and synthesis). The coordination is explicit: You use the waking mind to feed work to the background mind which is “the solver of most non-trivial problems”; you weight your inputs to the background mind in order to influence their priority in its thinking.</p>
<p>I guess I’ve done that kind of thing implicitly from time to time, but never in such an intentional way. So, is Clojure-in-Postgres worth exploring? Perhaps by writing this I’ll prime my background mind and will receive more clarity in the morning.</p>

Movement outside of the boundary tends to be a transitional state.&nbsp; The thick red line illustrates the usual boundaries in the figure below.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/post/plotting-how-to-make-better-decisions">This post explored how to make better decisions using the framework</a> and laid down the idea that some decisions can occur off-piste, outside of the normal boundaries. It presented the reason why we need to minimise shared decision making, find followers and create shared passion if we want to make a difference.&nbsp; Indeed it is no longer about enemies in the camp but about identifying those who share the belief. We must have diversity and not about diversification away from the shared belief.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>I explored the concept that we are <a href="https://opengovernance.net/what-occurs-when-physical-beings-transition-to-information-beings-146ea9dcbca3">transitioning from Physical beings to Information beings</a>.&nbsp; The article proposed that our existing models for oversight and governance are breaking and that we need to think about addressing this emerging gap.&nbsp; In an earlier post, I explained that many <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/post/hello-world">models take us to the boundaries</a> in the Peak Paradox framework, such as cults, politics, beliefs and religion.&nbsp; This post presents the thinking that the economic model of monopoly and political activity of war are outside the framework and a transitional state.&nbsp;</p> As physical beings&nbsp; <p>In the figure below, war and monopoly are outside the boundary between Peak Individual Purpose and Peak Work Purpose.&nbsp; War is nasty, inhumane, and complex, but it serves as a tool to acquire more land with a historical lens. Control of land gave you access to resources, people and materials.&nbsp; The more land and more resources you had access to, in straightforward terms, enabled a few to realise their Peak Individual Purpose (become more sovereign) and for others to realise Peak Work Purpose through growth.&nbsp;</p><p>A more modern version of war is the economics of monopoly, duopoly, or cartel, where a few seek to control resources for their personal gain, enabling them to achieve Peak Individual Purpose through their companies having control.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Both war and monopoly have become increasingly regulated over time. We have created, as humans, complex rules of engagement, governance and oversight.&nbsp; In part to ensure control and power does not fall to one person in a democracy, to protect the vulnerable and to respect life.&nbsp; If they work or not is another story.&nbsp;</p><p></p> As information beings <p>It is not that physical has or will vanish; we will co-exist as both physical and informational. Our physical being is still very much here, but we live in an emergent digital/ data augmented world.&nbsp; War has become cyberwarfare and monopoly of land, and people have become the monopoly of data that indirectly controls people and land, often through an instrument such as debt.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>The question being asked is, “have we changed more than just the nature of war and monopoly as we expand from physical beings to information beings?”&nbsp; Our rules, methods, insights and policy work for us as physical beings, but do the same systems and structures work in an information age.&nbsp; Is the paradox that we have to deal with the same outcomes from war and monopolies (control and power), but there is a shift.&nbsp; What is this shift? &nbsp; Yes, some cybercrime and cyber warfare is a replication of the historical war framing, insomuch that an individual, cause or nation wants to use data/ digital as a method of control.&nbsp; But this is just the natural advancement of physical beings adapting to new technology. Gunpowder is another example.&nbsp; However, information being cyberwar is a fight or rage against the machine trying to bring about a better life for everyone and expose injustice - this is different. Past freedom fighters against oppression look similar.&nbsp; A monopoly of data is different to a monopoly of physical resources because <a href="https://opengovernance.net/data-is-data-90ba0b803178">data is data</a>.&nbsp; Data is, by its nature, non-rivalrous and non-excludable. This simple fact is that you cannot declare ownership of data (though many people try); you cannot control it; you lose nothing when you copy it. It is why data is data. &nbsp; Data can bring about better health care; data can bring about better education; data can bring transparency, and data can bring equality.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://opengovernance.net/what-occurs-when-physical-beings-transition-to-information-beings-146ea9dcbca3">An AI can make better decisions,</a> if we knew what this is, without the bias of human politics. However, it is far too easy to keep our physical being lens on everything as we like it, we are used to it, our systems are aligned to it, and we can ignore or rubbish the emergence and augmentation of data in our decision methodology.&nbsp; A critical point beginning that what we had as oversight and controls for war and monopoly worked for physical beings. The same systems break as informational beings because there is a shift in purpose and even outcomes. What is hard to comprehend is that this is not a transition; it is the emergence of information beings and that both will co-exist. We need to keep adapting our physical rules but need new thinking for informational beings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>What does the Peak Paradox framework highlight about this situation? There is an assumption that we are aligned (what type of being are we or both) and how we understand if there is alignment in the team.&nbsp; Because this is hard and subtle, we prefer to assume and make jumps because curiosity and questioning expose ghosts in our thinking and the system;&nbsp; like conflict, tension and power. We don't like facing up to these as they are hard and reflective. The Peak Paradox framework will surface the ghosts and determine if there is an alignment or a delta in the team, project, mission or purpose.&nbsp; If we are only physical beings in our views, we will ignore digital and data and the coming information being. &nbsp; If we are information beings, we see that the controls don’t work, and we are free to exploit an emergent space.&nbsp; The current data monopoly holders don’t look like monopolies through the lens of physical beings.</p><p>The current data monopoly holders don’t look like monopolies through the lens of physical beings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>War and monopoly exist in both the physical and data/ digital/ information world. Still, we cannot apply the same system of the physical world controls developed over generations to the digital/ data/ information world - it is not they break it is they don’t work. &nbsp; The system of control fails because the purpose for which war and monopoly exist is the same and has created a new space.&nbsp; We use the exact same words, but the meaning has changed.&nbsp; Why is monopoly different in a data/ digital information world? Because it looks competitive, data is movable, and users have a choice.&nbsp; Why is war in a data/ digital information world different - because the outcome is not about control.&nbsp; However, the physical still exists, which can confuse and create paradoxes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p> <br>

<p>On the top left is a photo taken with my trusty old (also much used and abused) <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/canon-eos-5d-mark-iii">Canon 5D Mark III</a>. On the top right is one taken by a borrowed new <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/products/sony/slrs/sony_a7riii">Sony a7Riii</a>. Below both are cropped close-ups of detail. The scene is in a room illuminated by incandescent track lighting. It is not an art shot, though it does contain photo art by our good friend <a href="https://mariancrostic.com/">Marian Crostic</a>, whose&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/sony-alpha-a7r">Sony a7R</a>&nbsp;she is kindly remanding to my custody tomorrow. (Her main camera is now an a7Riii like the borrowed one I used here.)</p>
<p>Both photos were shot with Canon and Sony’s best 24-105 f4 zoom lenses, at the 105mm end. Both were also set to automatic, meaning the camera chooses all the settings. In both cases the camera chose ISO 3200 at f4. The only difference was shutter speed: 1/125 sec on the Canon and 1/160 sec on the Sony. While 3200 is not the prettiest ISO, I wanted to compare both cameras indoors under less than ideal lighting, because that’s typical of situations where I shoot a lot of people.</p>
<p>One difference between these cameras is the pixel density of the sensor: the Canon’s shot is 5760 x 3840 pixels, while the Sony’s is 7952 x 5304. While that difference accounts for some of the higher detail in the Sony’s shot, it’s clear to me that the Sony lens is simply sharper, as <a href="https://www.kenrockwell.com/">Ken Rockwell</a>&nbsp;kinda promised in <a href="https://www.kenrockwell.com/sony/lenses/24-105mm-f4.htm">this glowing review</a>. (Also, to be fair, the Canon lens has had a&nbsp;lot of use.)</p>
<p>All the images above are screen shots of RAW versions of the photos (.CR2 for the Canon and .ARW for the Sony). Though I don’t have the time or patience to show differences in the .JPG versions of these photos, it’s clear to me that the Canon’s JPGs look less artifacted by compression. The obvious artifacts in the Sony shots have me thinking I may only shoot RAW with the a7R, though I’ll need to test it out first.</p>
<p>The main difference overall, at least in this setting, is in the warmth of the color. There the Canon has a huge advantage. I could say it’s also because the Sony is slightly less exposed (by the higher shutter speed); but I noticed the same difference in test shots I took outdoors as well, under both overcast and sunlit skies, and at ISO 100. The Canon seems warmer, though the Sony has far more detail one can pull out of shadows.</p>
<p>I should add that neither camera got the color of the wall (a creamy white) right in these photos, with the Canon leaning hot and the Sony leaning cool.</p>
<p>Anyway, I just thought I’d share that much before I pick up the a7R, and start using it to shoot stuff in New York, where I’m headed Wednesday night after more than a year away.</p>

<p>What are Zero Knowledge Proof enabled credentials </p>



<p>Zero Knowledge Proof enabled credentials allows you to selectively disclose claims from a verifiable credential without disclosing all of the information of the verifiable credential. It also makes it possible to verify data without having to share the sensitive data required to verify something. In this post, we will just selectively request part of the data from a verifiable credential. This would make it possible to implement business flows without having to share or copy the sensitive data.</p>



<p>Setup ZKP Vaccination Data Issue and Verify</p>



<p>The demo application implements a covid vaccination data process. A number of components, applications are required to implement these flows. The idea is that when a person is vaccinated, the authority responsible for this could add the vaccination data to the persons identity. In this demo, that would be added to the Auth0 service which can be accessed in the id_token claims. The vaccination data organization can use the credentials issuer application to create a DID credential issuer using ZKP verifiable credentials. The end user can use a digital wallet to add his or his credentials using the SIOP flow which gets the claims from the IDP and adds the data to the digital wallet.  The verification application would have to create a presentation template defining the claims which are required to use to verify. Once created, a new verification request can be created and used to verify the vaccination data from the user. The user would scan the presented QR Code from the verifier application and display a verify in the digital wallet. Once consented, the data is returned to the verifier application using an API. The data can be processed and the UI is updated with a verified result or not. The blockchain ledger is abstracted away and used indirectly through MATTR which has APIs for the Self sovereign identity specifications. </p>







<p>Issuing Zero Knowledge Proof enabled credentials</p>



<p>The VaccineCredentialsIssuer ASP.NET Core application is used to create the credential issuer and present this as a QR Code for the user to add vaccination Zero Knowledge Proofs verifiable credentials. The flow implemented is very similar to the flow used in the previous blog <a href="https://damienbod.com/2021/05/03/create-an-oidc-credential-issuer-with-mattr-and-asp-net-core/">Create an OIDC credential Issuer with MATTR and ASP.NET Core</a> . A DID is created to use a BLS key type which supports BBS+ signatures for issuing ZKP-enabled credentials. </p>


  public class MattrOptions
{
	/// &lt;summary&gt;
	/// The supported key types for the DIDs are ed25519 and bls12381g2. 
	/// If the keyType is omitted, the default key type that will be used is ed25519.
	/// 
	/// If the keyType in options is set to bls12381g2 a DID will be created with 
	/// a BLS key type which supports BBS+ signatures for issuing ZKP-enabled credentials.
	/// &lt;/summary&gt;
	public string keyType { get; set; } = "bls12381g2";
}
  


<p>The DID is used to create a credential issuer for the ZKP credentials. The CreateMattrCredentialIssuer method takes the DID created with the bls12381g2 key and creates the OIDC credential issuer.</p>


  private async Task&lt;V1_CreateOidcIssuerResponse&gt; CreateMattrCredentialIssuer(HttpClient client, V1_CreateDidResponse did)
{
	// create vc, post to credentials api
	// https://learn.mattr.global/tutorials/issue/oidc-bridge/setup-issuer

		},
		FederatedProvider = new FederatedProvider
		{
			ClientId = _configuration["Auth0Wallet:ClientId"],
			ClientSecret = _configuration["Auth0Wallet:ClientSecret"],
			Url = new Uri($"https://{_configuration["Auth0Wallet:Domain"]}"),
			Scope = new List&lt;string&gt; { "openid", "profile", "email" }
		}
	};

	var payloadJson = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(payload);

	var uri = new Uri(createCredentialsUrl);

	using (var content = new StringContentWithoutCharset(payloadJson, "application/json"))
	{
		var createOidcIssuerResponse = await client.PostAsync(uri, content);

		if (createOidcIssuerResponse.StatusCode == System.Net.HttpStatusCode.Created)
		{
			var v1CreateOidcIssuerResponse = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;V1_CreateOidcIssuerResponse&gt;(
					await createOidcIssuerResponse.Content.ReadAsStringAsync());

			return v1CreateOidcIssuerResponse;
		}

		var error = await createOidcIssuerResponse.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
	}

	throw new Exception("whoops something went wrong");
}
  


<p>The data from the MATTR response is used to create the callback for the credentials issuer. This is persisted to a database as this needs to be created only once and can be re-used.</p>


   public async Task&lt;string&gt; CreateCredentialsAndCallback(string name)
        {
            // create a new one
            var vaccinationDataCredentials = await CreateMattrDidAndCredentialIssuer();
            vaccinationDataCredentials.Name = name;
            await _vaccineCredentialsIssuerCredentialsService.CreateVaccinationData(vaccinationDataCredentials);

            var callback = $"https://{_mattrConfiguration.TenantSubdomain}/ext/oidc/v1/issuers/{vaccinationDataCredentials.OidcIssuerId}/federated/callback";
            return callback;
        }
  


<p>The data is displayed as a QR Code in a ASP.NET Core Razor page application. This can be scanned and the credentials will be added to your digital wallet, if the Open ID Connect server has the claims for the identity required by this issuer.</p>







<p>Auth0 is used to add the identity data for the claims. An Auth0 pipeline rule was created and used to add these claims to the id_tokens.</p>


  function (user, context, callback) {
    const namespace = 'https://damianbod-sandbox.vii.mattr.global/';

    context.idToken[namespace + 'date_of_birth'] = user.user_metadata.date_of_birth;
  
    context.idToken[namespace + 'family_name'] = user.user_metadata.family_name;
    context.idToken[namespace + 'given_name'] = user.user_metadata.given_name;
    context.idToken[namespace + 'medicinal_product_code'] = user.user_metadata.medicinal_product_code;
    context.idToken[namespace + 'number_of_doses'] = user.user_metadata.number_of_doses;
    context.idToken[namespace + 'total_number_of_doses'] = user.user_metadata.total_number_of_doses;
    context.idToken[namespace + 'vaccination_date'] = user.user_metadata.vaccination_date;
    context.idToken[namespace + 'country_of_vaccination'] = user.user_metadata.country_of_vaccination;
  
    callback(null, user, context);
}
  


<p>The data needs to be added to each user in Auth0. If using this in a real application, a UI could be created and used to add the specific data for each user. The credential issuer is tightly coupled through the data with the IDP. So each credential issuer which creates verifiable credentials would require it’s own identity provider and full access to update the profiles. The IDP contains the business data required to issuer the credentials. Auth0 might not be a good choice for this, maybe something like IdentityServer or Openiddict would be a better choice because you could implement custom UIs with ASP.NET Core Identity and the complete UIs for the credential issuing flows.</p>



<p>When the credential issuer is scanned by the digital wallet, the user logs into the OIDC server and gets the data for the ZKP verifiable credentials. In a MATTR wallet, this is displayed with the Privacy enhancing credential information.</p>







<p>Verifying the credentials</p>



<p>Before the ZKP credentials can be verified, a presentation template is created to define the required credentials to verify. The DID ID from the credential issuer is used to find the DID in the ledger. The CreateMattrPresentationTemplate method creates the template using the QueryByFrame so that the exact claims can be defined. The context must use the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ldp-bbs2020/context/v1">https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ldp-bbs2020/context/v1</a> namespace to use the ZKP BBS+ credentials in MATTR. The type must be VerifiableCredential.</p>

		}

		var error = await presentationTemplateResponse.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();

	}

	throw new Exception("whoops something went wrong");
}
  


<p>The VaccanationDataCredentialSubject class defines the specific claims to use for the verification.</p>


  public class VaccanationDataCredentialSubject
{
	[Newtonsoft.Json.JsonProperty("@explicit", Required = Newtonsoft.Json.Required.Always)]
	public bool Explicit { get; set; }

	[Newtonsoft.Json.JsonProperty("family_name", Required = Newtonsoft.Json.Required.Always)]

	[Newtonsoft.Json.JsonProperty("date_of_birth", Required = Newtonsoft.Json.Required.Always)]
	[System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Required]
	public object DateOfBirth { get; set; } = new object();

	[Newtonsoft.Json.JsonProperty("medicinal_product_code", Required = Newtonsoft.Json.Required.Always)]
	[System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Required]
	public object MedicinalProductCode { get; set; } = new object();
}
  


<p>Verifying is very similar to the blog <a href="https://damienbod.com/2021/05/10/present-and-verify-verifiable-credentials-in-asp-net-core-using-decentralized-identities-and-mattr/">Present and Verify Verifiable Credentials in ASP.NET Core using Decentralized Identities and MATTR</a>. A new DID of type ed25519 is used to invoke a verify request and also sign the request. The verifying flow in the application presents a QR Code using the redirectURL technic because the signed request is too long to present as a QR Code. This request returns a 302 with the full jws. </p>







<p>The application needs to be started using a public domain because the digital wallet will request back to the API with the data. I use ngrok to test locally. The verifier application can be started and the verify process is started by clicking the verify button which displays the QR Code to verify. </p>



<p>Start the application and start ngrok </p>


  ngrok http http://localhost:5000
  


<p>The QR Code can be scanned to verify.</p>







<p>In the digital wallet, the verification request for the vaccination data can be viewed and if ok sent. The digital wallet displays the data which is disclosed and the data which is not. When the user clicks send, the data is validated and the API from the verifier application is called.</p>







<p>When the Verify application receives the callback from the digital wallet, the data is validated and the challenge ID is used to notify the user of a successful verification. The data is saved to a database and ASP.NET Core SignalR is used to update the UI. When the message from SignalR is sent, the user is redirected to the success page using the challenge ID and the data is displayed with the success image.</p>







<p>Notes</p>



<p>Now we have a full create, holder, verify process implemented for Zero Knowledge Proof verifiable credentials using covid vaccination data. OIDC is used to authenticate and create the claims used for the credentials. The OIDC connect server or identity provider is tightly coupled to the credential issuer because business uses the data from the id_token. When using SIOP, I would use ASP.NET Core Identity and either OpenIddict of Identityserver4 to implement this as part of the credential issuer. You need full control of the claims so using Auth0, Azure AD or Azure B2C would probably be a bad choice here. You could federate then to one of these from the credential issuer to use the profiles as required. Each vaccinated user would also require a user account. ZKP verifiable credentials makes it possible to support user privacy better and mix claims easier from different credentials. Another problem with this solution is the vendor lockdown. This is a problem with any self sovereign solution at the moment. Even though, the specifications are all standard, unless you want to implement this completely yourself, you would choose a vendor specific implementation which locks you down to a specific wallet or with specific features only. Interop does not seem to work at the moment. This is a problem with all security solutions at present not just SSI, all software producers, security services use security reasoning as an excuse to try to force you into lockdown into their specific product. You can see this with most of the existing OIDC solutions and services. Typical quotes for this are “You can use any OIDC client, but we recommend our OIDC client…” SSI will open possibilities for new security solutions and it will be very interesting to see how application security develops in the next five years. </p>

     <br><p>Day zero of being a #CDO is probably not the best day to ask difficult questions; however, sometimes, there is no better day.&nbsp; The first question to ask the executive leadership team as you walk around being introduced might be: “What is the one thing that we, as a team and organisation, want our data to drive, deliver or provide?”</p><p>You might want to wait to ask this question and first determine what tools are being used. This will frame what outcomes and decisions are being supported.&nbsp; The question and answers allow you to determine if there is an alignment or gap between “What is the one thing that we, as a team and organisation what our data to drive, deliver or provide?”&nbsp; and what will happen anyway because of tools, processes and legacy.&nbsp; One critical aspect of being a #CDO is determining how our processes and methods only enable certain decisions to be made, but we have to unpack legacy.</p><p>Legacy within this framing is threefold. Decisions. Decisions. Decisions. These are:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>Decisions that created processes, methods and rules which were created by previous incentives and power games; and are now ghosts in the systems. These decisions were taken so long ago that no one knows why, how or when it was decided.&nbsp; It is the way we do it; it is our IP, our brand.</p>  <p>Decisions that created “information and technology debt” included embedded and baked-in systems, hidden, and no-longer supported code, and automation based on tools and data biased when created.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Decisions that created noise in the hierarchy to lose or filter signals that someone did not want to hear.&nbsp; It was the creation of layers, reports, practices, structural regulation and unchallenged assumptions.</p>  <p>Unpacking legacy questions will take time, and you will not be ready on Day-0. Therefore any responses you get have to be framed within such understanding when it arrives.&nbsp; It is worth asking the question and then verifying before becoming blind to the tools that mould you.&nbsp;</p><p>“What is the one thing that we, as a team and organisation what our data to drive, deliver or provide? &nbsp;Well, it could be:</p>  <p>Evidence-based, actionable insights</p>  <p>What should we automate?</p>  <p>How do we know we are doing the right thing?</p>  <p>Where are there efficiencies to be gained?</p>  <p>What do customers really want?</p>  <p>How to manipulate customers to increase margin and revenues?</p>  <p>Where are risks that we cannot see?</p>  <p>What is being hidden that we cannot see?</p>  <p>If you look at this list in the context of what tools and decisions already frame the response, are these what we are looking for data to answer or are we looking to data to affirm/ justify what we have already decided.&nbsp; A different response that no one will say “to justify what we are already doing!”</p><p>Data has bias because of previous decisions. Therefore, a #CDO has to find non-data tools to check what decisions from the past are biasing the current data, processes and tools. We cannot usefully answer the question we have set ourselves “What is the one thing that we, as a team and organisation what our data to drive, deliver or provide? without understanding the situation.</p><p>The CTO knows that they have to build a new platform when the bug list, new feature development and maintenance costs are bigger and will take more time than developing a new platform - this is the technology debt question.&nbsp; As the #CDO, you have to understand what is your information debt. The CTO will struggle as there is no clear path from policy to code. Similarly, the CDO, we struggle with no clear path from policy (what one thing) to better data for the decisions we require.&nbsp; You inherit and are now accountable for previous decisions, which constrain what is now possible as the biased tool has created what we have. The costs of collecting, labelling, holding, sorting and creating training data continually increase, creating a more significant gap and misalignment in values and expectations from data.</p><p>“We become what we behold. We shape our tools, and then our tools shape us”&nbsp; is often mistakenly attributed to Marshall McLuhan (as in the image above) and called McLuhan Law. The quote was actually written by Father John Culkin, SJ, a Professor of Communication at Fordham University in New York and friend of McLuhan. Such is the problem with data.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps the opening question is the wrong one? Perhaps we should reflect on these questions as a leadership team.</p>  <p>What do we want to become, and what tools and data will help us?</p>  <p>What tools do we use, and what will they enable us to become?&nbsp;</p>  <p>What is the minimum viable data set required to give the best value?&nbsp;</p>  <p>Do our tools and data trap us?</p>  <br>

<p>ZmartZone has implemented OAuth 2.0 Resource Server functionality in Apache/NGINX modules so these components can be used as a reverse proxy in front of APIs or other backends. In such a setup the backend does not have to deal with security but outsources it to a proxy sitting in front of it in a similar way that TLS termination is often offloaded to a load-balancer.</p>



<p>Most of the OAuth 2.0 deployments today use so-called bearer access tokens that are easy to deploy and use. This type of access token is not bound to the Client presenting the token which means that an attacker intercepting an access token can just use that token to get access to the resources/APIs/services as if it were the Client. So called Proof-of-Possession semantics for access tokens prevent that type of attack and present a more secure setup but such a system is typically harder to implement, deploy and maintain. </p>



<p>A relative simple variant of Proof-of-Possession for access tokens is specified in <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8705">RFC 8705 OAuth 2.0 Mutual-TLS Client Authentication and Certificate-Bound Access Tokens</a>. This  specification leverages a (possibly self-signed) certificate held by the Client to bind an access token cryptographically to the private key associated with that certificate.</p>



<p>This specification is implemented in <a href="https://github.com/zmartzone/liboauth2/releases/tag/v1.4.1">liboauth2 1.4.1</a> which is used in the Apache module <a href="https://github.com/zmartzone/mod_oauth2/releases/tag/v3.2.1">mod_oauth2 3.2.1</a>. This means that you can now require and verify OAuth 2.0 certificate bound access tokens for your API in a very simple way that is easy to deploy. All it takes is an Apache server in front of your API, configured with something like:</p>



<p><code>AuthType oauth2<br>OAuth2TokenVerify jwk "{\"kty\":\"RSA\",\"kid\":\"one\",\"use\":\"sig\",\"n\":\"...\",\"e\":\"AQAB\" }" type=mtls&amp;mtls.policy=optional<br>SSLVerifyClient optional_no_ca</code></p>

     <br><p>You are standing in front of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy_characters#Deep_Thought">Deep Thought</a>, as in the AI in HitchHicker Guide to the Galaxy.&nbsp; You are tasked with asking the famous question.&nbsp; “What is the answer to the world, the universe and everything?”&nbsp; In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Adams">Douglas Adams</a> original work, Deep Thought responds by saying, “it will take some time”; before coming back sometime later with the answer “42.”&nbsp; However, this is when data was a statistic, and we were “physical beings” who had not considered what experience would emerge as data became dynamic and we transitioned to “information beings.”</p><p>In our new context as informational beings, Deep Thought would not just take our question, go off to think about it but would respond.&nbsp; Deep Thought would do what we do and ask for clarification and to check the understanding of the question. I can imagine Deep Thought asking, “I just wanta check what you mean by ‘the answer to the world the universe and everything’ and do you want a brave answer, comfortable, or courageous answer?&nbsp; I can do a kind, generous or safe one too? What type of answer do you want?”</p><p>This is the problem we are facing.&nbsp; The questions that we have learnt for governance and oversight over millennia were fabulous to determine who decides, and who decides who decides in a physical world. It was where a human was held responsible and accountable.&nbsp; The issue of oversight becomes very differnt when we have automation and machines/ AI make decisions for us, how do we know who decides?&nbsp; Our questions will not cut it. &nbsp;</p><p>When we apply our old governance, old oversight, old accountable models and old frameworks to new problems, it feels like there is a disconnect and there is a level of dysfunctionality as the old model was not designed for the new problems.&nbsp; There is a forward capability; insomuch that old problems can be addressed better on the new systems, but the old systems cannot help solve or answer new questions.&nbsp; There is a backwards capability issue (not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_compatibility">backwards compatibility</a>), just like you cannot run the latest software on the early computers.&nbsp;</p><p>We appear to be right now lost (which the media portrays as division or civilisation collapse creating divides to gain clicks and generate revenue). In reality, we are transitioning from "Physical"&nbsp; to "Information" beings.&nbsp; I take comfort that the best minds at MIT cannot decide either:&nbsp; Atoms to Bits OR&nbsp; Bits to Atoms. We know if MIT is wrestling, then we are in a transition.</p><p>The transition to information beings is reaching a chasm or hurdle, as the old model, which we depended on for governance and oversight, is at the edge of its limits.&nbsp; Data can perfectly tell us how effective and efficient everything is, including the deviance to plan, but data could not tell us if the plan was right or if we are doing the right thing, efficacy.&nbsp; We depended on the oversight model of humans for this.&nbsp; The former, efficiency, is easy, the latter being really quite tricky as it is so contextual to the moment in time and values/ principles we currently hold.&nbsp; Data can tell us from where we came, our models based on said data can suggest where we will go, but as yet, we cannot determine if we should. As an adventurer, I tend to do it anyway, ignoring should, because it is there, and my scars are evidence that it does not always work out well.&nbsp;</p><p>The data, models, algorithms, ML and AI we have now created are capable of informing us if it is the right thing to do, but how do we know?</p><p>Writing things down, TV, Radio, Social media, books, screens, and printing created threats to established power structures that the old system of control adapted to embrace the new technology over time. However, I believe that the current oversight, governance, compliance and regulatory controls, which are based on the last 5000 years of adaption as physical beings, which are not bad in truth, CANNOT adapt to the next evolution from physical to information. Indeed our infrastructure gave rise to data, which is creating us as information beings.&nbsp; Our current models of helping us determine if we are doing the right thing fall apart as we evolve to become information beings because of a shift in power and control. Our current oversight was not designed for autonomous decision-making by a non-human, and whilst the old methods have adopted too many situations, this move to information beings appears, right now, to break the capabilities of current governance.&nbsp;</p><p>We feel the gap when we read the news but don’t as yet have the language or words to describe it. &nbsp; We deny and hide from this reality by focussing on back to normal growth and trying to create new models.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Governance follows change; it does not lead to a change. Governance and oversight help set up stability when we arrive at a new place. It is a flywheel for path dependency until someone breaks the axel. We are lucky to be alive now, seeing and witnessing this transition and can apply our minds to support this.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>as physical beings over generations, we learn that&nbsp;</p>  <p>power and control matter</p>  <p>monopoly and scale in a vertical matter</p>  <p>accountable and responsible limited to the very narrow works, and we can ignore any wider consequences&nbsp;</p>  <p>relationships have limited context</p>  <p>values and principles change slowly, allowing for rules to create an impression of stability</p>  <p>governance and oversight work to determine if we are doing the right thing by slowing decision time, filtering noise and hierarchy to create signals</p>  <br><p>as informational beings, we have not quite worked out the new game, however;</p>  <p>information and data must have attestation and rights as they matter</p>  <p>real-time learning models with computational power really matters</p>  <p>dependent and inter-dependence ecosystems ensure consequences matter</p>  <p>commons and the quality of the human experience on earth matter</p>  <p>collective and individual accountability and responsibility enable oversight in real-time</p>  <br><p>I believe we feel lost and vulnerable as we are starting to see that our lack of diversity, biased education, retention of power and control mechanisms, along with oversight and governance, worked for some of us some of the time as physical beings.&nbsp; However, they are not suitable when we arrive at "information beings," wanting everything to work for most people most of the time. Utopia is still a dream.&nbsp; We are at the start of a journey, and right now, we lack language, words, stories, rhetoric, meaning, models, structures, frameworks and a north star.&nbsp;</p><p>We know that growth fuels increasing salaries which is a mechanism for control by creating more debt, as you can borrow more.&nbsp; Growth hides and maintains the lie about change for longer. It is the flywheel. Increasing lifestyles create more people who have to remain aligned,&nbsp; the balance of sufficient salary to have enough debt that you remain conformist and will do as needed.&nbsp; Data means we can now pick up signals from employees about who is a conformist because of debt/ trapped.&nbsp; They are the easiest to corrupt, will be the weak link in the security chain, allows someone to control or exert undue influence - keep the model and the belief.&nbsp; The wheels are coming off, and the axels are breaking.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>What happens when AI (who is not paid) and is not aligned to the power plays makes decisions for the best outcome.&nbsp; How will you control the AI, like we use salary for humans?</p><p>Such interesting times</p> <br>

This new information definitely adds value to any required reactive decision. The identification of what the actual object is through increased resolution has an incremental value but not as much as knowing it is there and what direction at what speed but such information can lead to a better decision but suddenly there is an economics of cost compared to the incremental improvement in outcome.&nbsp; Knowing what type of bird by species or what plane by manufacturer, does add cost and size of data set but it does not add any value in terms of the decision requirement.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, current data scientists, enthusiasts and idealists are asking you to store vast quantities of data from your customer and eco-system in the hope that at some point the algorithms and AI technology will give you new rich and deep insights, such as the equivalent resolution of what rivet types are used in construction for the inbound missile for Radar. We have to question when even though technically possible,&nbsp; does the resolution stop adding value?</p><p>The more data you collect the better the decisions you will be able to make in the future is a lie that is driving boards to take on the cost for data and data risk that is beyond their scope of any calculatable return.&nbsp; “Collect all the data and store it as you don’t know what we might discover” is hope and choice, it is not a rational business decision. The hope is wrapped up in a power pitch that our competitive advantage will be the discovery and ability to perform magical acts of mind manipulation which will supercharge sales through the control of customers. Or is it fear that everyone else will have this and we will have no future, FOMO of the big data promise.&nbsp;</p><p>Investing in the future is a fantastic idea when collecting moon or martian dust and storing it until we improve our science tools and instruments but for a company right now this is a lie. &nbsp; We are collecting and storing data in the hope that an algorithm will be able to mine more value than the cost of collecting, storing and algorithm development.&nbsp; Right now there is little evidence from all the work done that using data to change behaviour works at scale.&nbsp; This is a real cost today for “hope,” which the CFO has not found an ethical way to put on a balance sheet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We have been sold a vision the more data we have the better decisions and insights we will have. Any data scientist or statistician will confirm that resolution of a decision or insight will not substantially improve beyond a certain data set size.&nbsp; You are not keeping and storing data for better decision making and insight today, just in the hope for new insights tomorrow. But the COO, CIO, CDO or CTO who is empire-building and determine that size equates to power within your culture are dependent on fear, uncertainty and doubt and insufficiently skilled directors to be able to challenge this. The tech looks like magic and every consulting company sees this as a revenue stream and write reports to support this view.</p><p>As a sceptic of the big data story, this article nicely aligns with your affinity and belief.&nbsp; You see that your next action is the stop the ever-increasing data spend and focus on traditional business.&nbsp; Whilst difficult to understand data is the right answer to business problems.&nbsp; The takeaway should be to question: Where is the diminishing return for data for your organisation?&nbsp; How do you know the data is good? How do you know the analysis is good. How do you know if what you are doing is the right thing to do? How do you incentive the right actions?</p><p>Data is not the problem, too much data will not create the return we hope for based on the cost we have, but we have to remain focussed that data is essential. How do we make data work for most of the people most of the time and not a few people on the odd occasion.&nbsp;</p>

Surely something else must come second, lose or be compromised.&nbsp; Right now, as our models win the Earth is not compromised, as the Earth will remain here for another few billion years irrespective of what we do - it will just have a different balance. The compromise is the burden of our future generations from whom we have removed choice.&nbsp; We have not questioned and determined what lifestyle they want; we have just focussed on the one we can get.&nbsp;</p><p>Can the Earth also win if the model wins? Definitely, however, can further generations enjoy and have a life we expect if our models remain - that is a hope that we need to question.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>My mother Betty passed away Friday night and her service is Saturday at 2pm at the Kingwood Funeral Home.  This is one of my favorite pictures of her with her mother and my brother David in downtown San Francisco.</p>

<p>Growing up, I always remember that there was a set of golf clubs in the garage but it seemed like they were never used.  Luckily, this week, I listened to a Christmas audio message from 1971 that my parents had sent to my grandparents.  My mom said that the day before, Baxter had taken her to the golf course at Heather Farm and they golfed nine holes.  She said on the first hole, she amused several bystanders trying to get out of the sand trap and they decided to quit keeping score from there.  She said she learned golf was not her sport and would find something else.  She did find tennis.  I was glad to play that sport with her and the family.</p>

<p>The Net Uptime Monitor</p>



<p><br>What it does…</p>



<p><br>Is your internet connection unreliable? You’ve probably called your internet provider’s support line and maybe they were able to help you, maybe they even sent out a tech to look at it. But all too often the response is “Well, it’s working fine now!”</p>



<p><br>The Net Uptime Monitor alerts you to failures in your internet connection and documents the exact time and length of those failures. This failure log will help your provider troubleshoot the problem – after it helps you convince them it’s not your imagination! Net Uptime Monitor is designed to be as simple as possible and accomplish this one purpose accurately and thoroughly with the least effort from you.</p>



<p><br>How it works…</p>



<p><br>Net Uptime Monitor (NUM) uses the “Ping” command to test the response from three public servers operated by Google, Level 3, and OpenDNS. (See “What’s a Ping?” below for an explanation.) Each server is pinged in turn at an interval that you can set – normally five seconds. By default, NUM waits 200 milliseconds (2/10 of a second) for the server to respond – at least 3 times as long as a typical broadband internet connection should take.</p>



<p><br>NUM pings one server at a time; if the server responds, NUM waits the test interval, then pings the next server. If the server doesn’t respond, NUM immediately tries the next server, then the next. If any of the servers respond, then your connection must be working. Only when all three servers fail to respond does NUM determine that your connection is down.</p>



<p><br>By using three servers, NUM ensures that the problem isn’t just with the server or with some connection on the way to that server, or that the server isn’t momentarily slow or congested.</p>



<p><br>NUM can detect failures as short as a couple of seconds in length, but you can decide how long a failure must be before it really counts. A very short failure of a second or so is not likely to affect your use of the net and isn’t of any real concern. You can set how long a failure must be before NUM alerts you to it and records the failure in its failure log.</p>



<p><br>Connection is up, no previous failures…</p>



<p>Connection is down, one previous failure…</p>



<p>The display shows the names and IP addresses of each server. The indicator “light” flashes yellow when the ping is sent and shows green for a successful response. The response time of the last ping is shown. When the response time exceeds the time set for “Wait for Ping Response”, the indicator turns red to show no response from that server.</p>



<p><br>If your connection fails, the current fail length is displayed in red. When the length of the failure exceeds your setting for “Log Failure If Longer Than”, NUM plays an alert sound and writes the failure information into its log.</p>



<p><br>The display also shows the monitored time (how long the monitor has been running), the time since the last logged failure (up time), the start time and length of the last logged failure, and the total count of logged failures since NUM was started. The current settings for the test interval and the minimum failure length to be logged are shown at the bottom of the display.</p>



<p><br>Click the minimize button on the NUM window to hide the display. NUM disappears into your system tray in the “notifications area”. The NUM icon is shown in the notification – you can hover over the icon to see the current time since the last failure (“Up Time”) or click the icon to restore the display. In the Settings, you can choose to have a “failure alert” sound play, and/or have the NUM window “pop up”, if a connection failure longer than your minimum setting occurs.</p>



<p><br>The Log</p>



<p><br>NUM keeps a log of results in a text file. You can view the current log at any time by clicking the “View Log” button. The log is displayed in a separate window. NUM will continue to update the log even while you are viewing it.<br>Because the log is a plain text file, you can open it outside of the NUM program. It will open in Notepad or your default text editor, so you can easily edit or print the log.</p>



<p><br>The log records the start and end time of the monitoring and each failure start time and length. A summary shows the total monitoring time, failure count, total down time, percentage of down time, and the minimum, maximum, and average failure lengths. Here’s an example:</p>



<p>Net Uptime Monitor Failure Log (NetUptimeMonitor.com)<br>Licensed to Example User</p>



<p>=======================================</p>



<p>8/17/2015 8:44:28 AM Log Start</p>



<p>Failure Start Length<br>8/17/2015 1:44:25 PM 0:00:44<br>8/17/2015 1:49:53 PM 0:00:36</p>



<p>8/17/2015 1:52:39 PM 0:01:59</p>



<p>8/18/2015 12:13:17 AM Log End<br>Monitor Duration 15:28:46<br>Failure Summary:<br>Count 3<br>Total Downtime 0:03:20<br>% Downtime 0.36<br>Minimum Length 0:00:36<br>Maximum Length 0:01:59</p>



<p>Average Length 0:01:06</p>



<p>The example shows date and time in US English format; your log will use the format for your region.<br>The log files are saved in a folder of your choice; the default is your Documents folder. You can choose a different folder in the Settings.</p>



<p><br>Also in the Settings, there are two options for the log file:<br>1) New File Each Run<br>A new file is created each time NUM starts. Each log file is named with the date and time NUM was started so that they will appear in your directory in chronological order. The file name is in the form of “NetUptime 20110805 134243.txt”. In this example, the date is August 10, 2015 – 20150810 – and the time is 1:42:43 PM – 134243.<br>2) Add to Existing File<br>Each new log is added to the same single file. The file name is always NetUptime.txt. As long as that file exists in the folder where you have chosen to save the log file, NUM will keep adding to it. If the file doesn’t exist, i.e. it’s been deleted, moved, or renamed, NUM will start a new file.</p>



<p><br>The Settings</p>



<p>Click the “Change Settings” button on the NUM display to open the Settings window. There are several settings available:</p>



<p><br>Startup Settings…</p>



<p><br>· Start when Windows Starts? – Check the box and NUM will automatically start when your computer starts. Uncheck the box and you can start NUM when you want by clicking its desktop icon. The default on installation is checked – NUM starts automatically.<br>· Start Minimized in Tray? – Check the box and NUM will be minimized in the system tray automatically when it starts. The default on installation is unchecked – NUM starts with the main form displayed.<br>Test Settings…<br>· Test Interval – how many seconds between ping tests when the servers are responding. Five seconds is the default. It is possible that NUM will miss a failure that is shorter than the time between tests, so if your connection has very frequent failures of just a few seconds you might choose a shorter test interval. If you don’t have many failures, you may want to test less often. Most connection problems result in less frequent but longer failures, so five seconds is a good choice for most users.<br>· Wait for Ping Response – the length of time NUM waits for a response after sending a ping. The default setting of 200 milliseconds is recommended for normal situations. If you have a slower internet connection, such as a dialup or mobile connection, or are in a remote area where response is typically slow, you can set the wait time for up to 1500 milliseconds (1.5 seconds). To help you find the best setting for your situation, set the wait time to 1500 milliseconds and observe the ping response times NUM displays when your connection is working normally. Set the wait time to about 1.5 times the typical ping response times you see for efficient detection of outages.<br>· Change Target Servers – click to open the Target Servers window.</p>



<p>You can edit the IP Address and Name of any of the three servers. Click the Test button to try that server, verifying that it responds and checking the response time.</p>



<p><br>The default target servers (Google, Level 3, OpenDNS) were selected for their performance and very high reliability. You should only use a different server if you find that one of these servers does not respond reliably in your particular situation. Click “Restore Defaults” to reset the Target Servers to their original values. Changes to the Target Servers take effect the next time the program starts.</p>



<p><br>Alert and Log Settings…</p>



<p><br>· Pop Up on Failure? – Check the box and the NUM form will pop up from the system tray when there is a failure. Uncheck the box and NUM will continue to log and alert but it will stay minimized during a failure. The default on installation is checked – if NUM is minimized to the system tray, the main NUM form will be displayed when a failure is logged.<br>· Alert and Log Failure If Longer Than – the minimum failure length that will be counted, both for the log and the alert of a failure. Five seconds is the default setting.<br>· Log File Location – the folder where the logs will be stored. Click the “Select Folder” button to browse to the folder you want. The log for the current run of NUM is already started, so a change in this setting will not take effect until the next time you run NUM.<br>· Log File Option – New File Each Run (the default) or Add to Existing File. See previous section “The Log” for a more detailed explanation.<br>· Choose Failure Alert Sound – choose the sound NUM makes when a failure is counted. The sound plays when you choose its button so you can preview each one. Choose “None” to silence the alert. Choose “Custom” and click the Select File button to use any .WAV sound file on your system. The default on installation is the “Short” sound.<br>· Play Reconnect Sound – NUM can play a sound when your internet reconnects after a failure. Choose “None” to silence the reconnect sound. Choose “Custom” and click the Select File button to use any .WAV sound file on your system.</p>



<p><br>Combine Settings for “Invisible” Operation</p>



<p><br>NUM can do its job without showing itself or alerting the user to its operation in any way. Choose these settings:<br>· Start when Windows Starts? – checked.<br>· Start Minimized in Tray? – checked.<br>· Pop Up On Failure – unchecked.<br>· Choose Failure Alert Sound – None.<br>· Choose Reconnect Sound – None.<br>With this combination of settings, the user need never be aware of NUM. This is useful in a support situation where you are installing NUM on a computer you aren’t personally using.</p>



<p><br>What’s a Ping?</p>



<p><br>“Ping” is a command available on all kinds of computers that tests whether another computer on the network will respond to your computer. It’s named after the sound of submarine sonar systems – they send out a “ping” sound which bounces off their target and they listen for that echo, locating their target. The internet “ping” works in a similar way. You name your target, an internet server, and “ping” it. The ping command and response looks like this (in a DOS command window):</p>



<p><br>C:\ ping google.com</p>



<p>Pinging google.com [74.125.224.84] with 32 bytes of data:<br>Reply from 74.125.224.84: bytes=32 time=30ms TTL=54<br>Reply from 74.125.224.84: bytes=32 time=31ms TTL=54<br>Reply from 74.125.224.84: bytes=32 time=31ms TTL=54<br>Reply from 74.125.224.84: bytes=32 time=31ms TTL=54</p>



<p>Ping statistics for 74.125.224.84:<br>Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss),<br>Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:<br>Minimum = 30ms, Maximum = 31ms, Average = 30ms</p>



<p>A ping command actually generates four requests and the server replies four times. Each response is timed in thousandths of a second (ms = milliseconds). Here we see that the server at google.com responded in about 31/1000 or 3/100 of a second. The internet is fast! – when everything’s working.</p>

The global pandemic has accelerated our adoption and transformation, and we are in a better place than March 2020. However, sticking with oil, we know that the extraction process has downsides, including carbon release, messy, and difficulty locating economic wells. &nbsp; Amongst data’s most significant downsides are legal liabilities, noise and the wrong data.&nbsp;</p><p>I can easily hide data’s downsides through dashboards.&nbsp; Our dashboards are based on trickle-down KPI and objectives from our strategic plan.&nbsp; We hand out <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Set-SMART-Goals">SMART</a> objectives, but such objectives fundamentally assume that we are and continue to do the right thing.&nbsp; We gather data and post-analysis present it as trending graphs or red, amber, green dashboards, aiming for everything to be going in the right direction or green.&nbsp; Green only means we have no negative variance between our plan and the actual. Organisationally we are incentivised to achieve green at any unknown cost or consequence.&nbsp; Trending analysis can always be generated through the selection of data to fit the story.&nbsp;</p><p>Right now, we are using data to measure, analyse and inform. We have better control of variance across our entire operations and ecosystem than at any previous point in our history. We increasingly have to depend on dashboards to manage the complicated and complex, remain informed, and determine where our energies should be focussed.&nbsp; Without a doubt, this should remain and continue to be improved, but we are already on a diminishing return with the data we collect due to the increase in noise over signal and should aim to cull than add.&nbsp;</p><p>As an agenda item; should we introduce the colour BLUE into our reporting, trends, and dashboards to reduce reporting and data?&nbsp; The traditional traffic lights remain the same; blue is not replacing any of them; it can become the one that allows us to know we are doing the right thing and not just doing the wrong thing that is in the plan in the most efficient and effective way (can be green or red).</p><p>As a team, we have to feed our sense of enquiry, and our existing data gathering, analysis, and reporting do not value the complexity we are faced with. More data does not solve complexity. Data has allowed us to evolve from finance data as the most critical decision-making source to become more sensitive.&nbsp; Whilst we have far more data, it is still narrow, and we should consider how we prepare for the next evolution, which will not be more of the same data.&nbsp; Following on from customer data and the start in ESG, the next data set we are being mandated to report on is <a href="https://www.chieflearningofficer.com/2020/11/05/the-sec-just-mandated-human-capital-disclosure-what-does-this-mean-for-you/">Human Capital.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Human capital reporting opens up our ability to sense what our employees and ecosystem are sensing, seeing and implying; helping us to determine, using technologies such as sentiment analysis, if we are doing the right thing. Where are issues that are not on the dashboard are occurring? What, as yet, unidentified tensions and conflicts are created by our current trickle-down objective/ incentive system? However, as you can imagine, big brother, privacy, and trust are foundational issues we need to discuss front up before this next evolutionary step hits us.&nbsp; This next phase of our data journey means we will find it harder to hide in the selection of data for trends and dashboards or just seek the right trend or green. This is more data, but different data and it will fill a gap in our knowledge,&nbsp; meaning we will be better informed about complex decisions.&nbsp;</p><p>I would like to present for 15 minutes on this topic and host a 45-minute debate with your approval.</p><p>Your CDO</p> <br>

<p>The <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop</a> continues to be a central nucleus for thoughtful discussion and development of all things related to digital identity. The most recent workshop, which was held in mid-April, was no exception. Despite the lack of in-person interaction due to the ongoing global pandemic, this IIW was as lively as ever, bringing together a diverse set of stakeholders from across the globe to share experiences, swap perspectives, and engage in healthy&nbsp;debates.</p><p>One common theme this year was the continued development and adoption of BBS+ signatures, a type of multi-message cryptographic digital signature that enables selective disclosure of verifiable credentials. We first <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/ZKPs_for_JSON-LD">introduced</a> this technology at IIW30 in April 2020, and have been inspired and delighted by the community’s embrace and contribution to this effort across the board. In the year since, progress has been made in a variety of areas, from standards-level support to independent implementations and advanced feature&nbsp;support.</p><p>We thought we’d take a moment to round up some of the significant developments surrounding BBS+ signatures and highlight a few of the top items to pay attention to going&nbsp;forward.</p><p>Over the past few months, the linked data proofs <a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/jsonld-signatures-bbs">reference implementation</a> of BBS+ published a new release that introduces a variety of improvements in efficiency and security, including formal alignment to the W3C CCG <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/security-vocab/">Security Vocab</a> v3 definitions. In addition, support for JSON-LD BBS+ signatures was added to the <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-http-api/">VC HTTP API</a>, making it possible to test this functionality in an interoperable way with other vendors participating in an open environment.</p><p>An important element in enabling BBS+ signatures is using what’s known as a <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-pairing-friendly-curves-09">pairing-friendly curve</a>; for our purposes we use <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-pairing-friendly-curves-02#section-2.4">BLS12–381</a>. We have seen some promising signs of adoption for this key pair, with multiple Decentralized Identifier (DID) methods — both <a href="https://hackmd.io/@icZC4epNSnqBbYE0hJYseA/S1eUS2BQw">did:indy</a> from <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/">Hyperledger</a> and <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/ion">did:ion</a> from <a href="https://identity.foundation/">DIF</a> — indicating they intend to add or already have support for these keys, allowing BBS+ signatures to be issued across a variety of decentralized networks and ecosystems. This development is possible due to the fact that BBS+ signatures is a ledger-independent approach to selective disclosure, effectively no custom logic or bespoke infrastructure is needed for these digital signatures to be created, used and understood.</p><p>In addition, the Hyperledger Aries project has been hard at work developing interoperable and ledger-agnostic capabilities in open source. The method used to track interop targets within the cohort and ultimately measure conformance against Aries standards is what’s known as an <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0302-aries-interop-profile">Aries Interop Profile (AIP)</a>. A major upcoming update to AIP will add support for additional DID methods, key types and credential formats, as well as introducing Aries support for JSON-LD BBS+ signatures as part of <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/pull/579">AIP 2.0</a>. This will allow Aries-driven credential issuance and presentation protocols to work natively with BBS+ credentials, making that functionality broadly available for those in the Aries community and&nbsp;beyond.</p><p>There have also been a number of exciting developments when it comes to independent implementations of BBS+ signatures. <a href="https://animo.id/">Animo Solutions</a> has recently implemented JSON-LD BBS+ signatures support into the popular open-source codebase <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python">Hyperledger Aries Cloud Agent Python</a> (ACA-Py). In another independent effort, <a href="https://trinsic.id/">Trinsic</a> has contributed an <a href="https://github.com/trinsic-id/ld-proofs-dotnet">implementation</a> of JSON-LD BBS+ credentials which they have demonstrated to be working in tandem with <a href="https://github.com/trinsic-id/didcomm-v2">DIDComm v2</a>, a secure messaging protocol based on DIDs. Implementations such as these help to demonstrate that open standards are transparent, can be understood and verified independently, and can be implemented with separate languages and tech stacks. They also set the groundwork for demonstrating real testing-driven interoperability via mechanisms such as the VC HTTP API and AIP 2.0. We are continuously looking to improve the documentation of these specs and standards so that their implications and nuances can be more broadly understood by builders and developers looking to engage with the technology.</p><p>On the cryptographic side of things, progress is also being made in hardening the existing BBS+ specification as well as expanding BBS+ to support more advanced privacy-preserving features. A significant development in this area is the work of cryptographer Michael Lodder who has been actively conducting research on an enhanced credential revocation mechanism using <a href="https://github.com/mikelodder7/accumulator-rs">cryptographic accumulators</a> with BBS+. This approach presents a promising alternative to existing solutions that allow authoritative issuers to update the status of issued credentials without compromising the privacy of the credential holder or subject who may be presenting the credential. We see this as another application of BBS+ signatures in the context of verifiable credentials that carries a lot of potential in pushing this technology to an even more robust&nbsp;state.</p><p>There was also initial discussion and tacit agreement to create a new cryptography-focused working group at Decentralized Identity Foundation. As the new WG drafts its charter, the first work item of this group will be the <a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/bbs-signatures-spec/">BBS+ Signatures</a> spec which defines the cryptographic scheme known as BBS+ agnostic of its application in areas such as linked data signatures or verifiable credentials. In the future, this WG will likely evolve to include other crypto-related work items from the community.</p><p>This is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the momentum and development building around this technology in the community. We couldn’t be more excited about the future of BBS+ signatures, especially as we gear up to tackle the next set of hard problems in this area including privacy-preserving subject authentication and revocation using cryptographic accumulators. If you’re interested we encourage you to get involved, either by contributing to the <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/ldp-bbs2020">Linked Data Proofs specification</a>, checking out our <a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/bbs-signatures">reference</a> <a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/jsonld-signatures-bbs">implementations</a>, or participating in the new WG at DIF, to name but a few of the many ways to engage with this work. We look forward to doing this retrospective at many IIWs to come, documenting the ever-growing community that continues to champion this technology in dynamic and interesting ways.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/iiw32-bbs-and-beyond-1a41634c15b0">IIW32: BBS+ and beyond</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>There’s a <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-httpbis-message-signatures-04.html">new draft in the HTTP working group</a> that deals with signing HTTP messages of all types. Why is it here, and what does that give&nbsp;us?</p><p>HTTP is irrefutably a fundamental building block of most of today’s software systems. Yet security and identity need to be layered alongside HTTP. The most common of these is simply running the HTTP protocol over an encrypted socket using TLS, resulting in HTTPS. While this is a powerful and important security component, TLS works only my protecting the stream of bits in transit. It does not allow for message-level and application-level security operations. But what if we could sign the messages themselves?</p><p>While it is possible to wrap the body of a request in a cryptographic envelope like <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/jose/charter/">JOSE</a> or <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core2/">XML DSig</a>, such approaches force developers to ignore most of the power and flexibility of HTTP, reducing it to a dumb transport layer. In order to sign a message but keep using HTTP as it stands, with all the verbs and headers and content types that it gives us, we will need a scheme that allows us to add a detached signature to the HTTP message. The cryptographic elements to the message can then be generated and validated separately from the request itself, providing a layered approach.</p><p>There have been numerous attempts at creating detached signature methods for HTTP over the years, one of the most famous being the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-cavage-http-signatures">Cavage draft</a> which itself started as a community-facing version of <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Amazon’s SIGv4</a> method used within AWS. There were several other efforts, and all of them incompatible with each other in one way or another. To address this, the HTTP Working Group in the IETF stepped up and took on the effort of creating an RFC-track standard for HTTP message signatures that could be used across the variety of use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>As of the writing of this post, <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-httpbis-message-signatures-04.html">the specification is at version 04</a>. While it’s not finished yet, it’s recently become a bit more stable and so it’s worth looking at it in greater&nbsp;depth.</p> Normalizing HTTP <p>As it turns out, the hardest part of signing HTTP messages isn’t the signing, it’s the HTTP. HTTP is a messy set of specifications, with pieces that have been built up by many authors over many years in ways that aren’t always that consistent. A recent move towards consistency has been the adoption of <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8941.html">Structured Field Values</a> for HTTP. In short, structured fields allow HTTP headers to house simple, non-recursive data structures with unambiguous parsing and deterministic serialization. These aspects made it perfect for use within the HTTP message signatures specification.</p><p>Previous efforts at HTTP message signing concentrated on creating a signature around HTTP headers, and the current draft is no exception in allowing that. On top of that, the current draft also allows for the definition of specialty fields that contain other pieces of constructed information not found in the headers themselves. These covered components are identified and combined with each other into a signature input string. To this string is added a field that includes all of the input parameters to this signature. For example, let’s say we want to sign parts of this HTTP&nbsp;request:</p> POST /foo?param=value&amp;pet=dog HTTP/1.1<br>Host: example.com<br>Date: Tue, 20 Apr 2021 02:07:55 GMT<br>Content-Type: application/json<br>Digest: SHA-256=X48E9qOokqqrvdts8nOJRJN3OWDUoyWxBf7kbu9DBPE=<br>Content-Length: 18<br><br>{"hello": "world"} <p>We choose the components we want to sign, including the target of the request and a subset of the available headers, and create the following signature input&nbsp;string:</p> @request-target": post /foo?param=value&amp;pet=dog<br>"host": example.com<br>"date": Tue, 20 Apr 2021 02:07:55 GMT<br>"content-type": application/json<br>"digest": SHA-256=X48E9qOokqqrvdts8nOJRJN3OWDUoyWxBf7kbu9DBPE=<br>"content-length": 18<br>"@signature-params": ("@request-target" "host" "date" "content-type"  "digest" "content-length");created=1618884475;keyid="test-key-rsa-pss" <p>With a given HTTP message and a set of input parameters determining which parts of the message are covered with a signature, any party can re-generate this string with a reasonable level of success. Unsigned headers can be added to the message by intermediaries without invalidating the signature, and it’s even possible for an intermediary to add its own signature to the message on the way through — but we’ll get more into that advanced use case in a future post. The result of this is that the signer and verifier will re-create this signature input string independently of each&nbsp;other.</p><p>Now that we have a normalized string to sign, how do we actually sign&nbsp;it?</p> Signing and Verifying Content <p>Once we have the string, it’s a relatively straightforward matter of applying a key and signature function to the string. Any signature method that takes in and bunch of bytes and spits out a different set of bytes is technically feasible&nbsp;here.</p><p>How do the signer and verifier know which algorithm to use on a given method? It turns out that different deployments have drastically different needs in this regard. As a consequence, this is an aspect that is application specific by the specification, with several common methods called&nbsp;out:</p>  The signer and verifier can both be configured to expect only a specific algorithm, or have that algorithm identified by some aspect external to the protocol.  The signer and verifier can identify the key used to do the signing and figure out the signature algorithm based on that. If an application’s using JSON Web Keys, the alg field of the key provides an easy way to identify a signing mechanism.  If the signer and verifier need to signal the algorithm dynamically at runtime, there is an alg field in the signature parameter set itself that points to a new registry.  And if two or more of these methods are applicable to a given message, the answers all have to match, otherwise something fishy is going on and the signature is invalidated.  <p>Given the above signature input string and an RSA-PSS signing method, we end up with the following Base64-encoded bytes as the signature output:</p> NtIKWuXjr4SBEXj97gbick4O95ff378I0CZOa2VnIeEXZ1itzAdqTpSvG91XYrq5CfxCmk8zz1Zg7ZGYD+ngJyVn805r73rh2eFCPO+ZXDs45Is/Ex8srzGC9sfVZfqeEfApRFFe5yXDmANVUwzFWCEnGM6+SJVmWl1/jyEn45qA6Hw+ZDHbrbp6qvD4N0S92jlPyVVEh/SmCwnkeNiBgnbt+E0K5wCFNHPbo4X1Tj406W+bTtnKzaoKxBWKW8aIQ7rg92zqE1oqBRjqtRi5/Q6P5ZYYGGINKzNyV3UjZtxeZNnNJ+MAnWS0mofFqcZHVgSU/1wUzP7MhzOKLca1Yg== <p>This gives us a signed object, and now we need to put that into our HTTP&nbsp;message.</p> Sending Signatures in&nbsp;Messages <p>The HTTP message signature specification defines two new headers to carry the signature, Signature and Signature-Input. Both of these use the Dictionary construct from the HTTP Structured Field Values standard to carry a named signature.</p><p>But first, why two headers? This construct allows us to easily separate the metadata about the signature — how it was made — from the signature value itself. This separation makes parsing simpler and also allows the HTTP message signatures specification to support multiple independent signatures on a given&nbsp;message.</p><p>The Signature-Input header contains all the parameters that went into the creation of the signature, including the list of covered content, identifiers for the key and algorithm, and items like timestamps or other application-specific flags. In fact, this is the same value used as the last line of the signature input string, and so its values are always covered by the signature. The Signature header contains the value of the signature itself as a byte array, encoded in Base64. The signer chooses a name for the signature object and adds both items to the headers. The name has no semantic impact, it just needs to be unique within a given&nbsp;request.</p><p>Let’s say this signature is named sig1. The signer adds both headers to the request above, resulting in the following signed&nbsp;request.</p> POST /foo?param=value&amp;pet=dog HTTP/1.1<br>Host: example.com<br>Date: Tue, 20 Apr 2021 02:07:55 GMT<br>Content-Type: application/json<br>Digest: SHA-256=X48E9qOokqqrvdts8nOJRJN3OWDUoyWxBf7kbu9DBPE=<br>Content-Length: 18<br>Signature-Input: sig1=("host" "date" "content-type");created=1618884475;keyid="test-key-rsa-pss"<br>Signature: sig1=:NtIKWuXjr4SBEXj97gbick4O95ff378I0CZOa2VnIeEXZ1itzAdqTpSvG91XYrq5CfxCmk8zz1Zg7ZGYD+ngJyVn805r73rh2eFCPO+ZXDs45Is/Ex8srzGC9sfVZfqeEfApRFFe5yXDmANVUwzFWCEnGM6+SJVmWl1/jyEn45qA6Hw+ZDHbrbp6qvD4N0S92jlPyVVEh/SmCwnkeNiBgnbt+E0K5wCFNHPbo4X1Tj406W+bTtnKzaoKxBWKW8aIQ7rg92zqE1oqBRjqtRi5/Q6P5ZYYGGINKzNyV3UjZtxeZNnNJ+MAnWS0mofFqcZHVgSU/1wUzP7MhzOKLca1Yg==:  {"hello": "world"} <p>Note that none of the other headers or aspects of the message are modified by the signature process.</p><p>The verifier parses both headers, re-creates the signature input string from the request, and verifies the signature value using the identified key and algorithm. But how does the verifier know that this signature is sufficient for this request, and how does the signer know what to sign in the first&nbsp;place?</p> Applying the Message Signature Specification <p>As discussed above, the signer and verifier need to have a way of figuring out which algorithm and keys are appropriate for a given signed message. In many deployments, this information can be gleaned through context and configuration. For example, a key derivation algorithm based on the tenant identifier in the URL can be used to dereference the key needed for a given call. Or an application identifier passed in the body could point to a record giving both the expected algorithm and allowable key material.</p><p>In addition to defining a predictable way to determine this, an application of the HTTP message signatures specification also needs to define which parts of the message need to be signed. For example, and API might have very different behaviors based on a Content-Type header but not really care about the Content-Encoding. A security protocol like OAuth or GNAP would require signing the Authorization header that contains the access token as well as the @request-target specialty field.</p><p>The HTTP protocol is also designed to allow interception and proxy of requests and responses, with intermediaries fully allowed to alter the message in certain ways. Applications that need to account for such intermediaries can be picky about which headers and components are signed, allowing the signature to survive expected message modifications but protecting against unanticipated changes in&nbsp;transit.</p><p>This fundamentally means that no signature method will ever be perfect for all messages — but that’s ok. The HTTP message signature draft instead leans on flexibility, allowing applications to define how best to apply the signature methods to achieve the security&nbsp;needed.</p> Building the&nbsp;Standard <p>The HTTP message signatures specification is still a long way from being done. It’s taken in a number of different inputs and many years of collective community experience, and that initially resulted in some major churn in the specification’s syntax and structure. <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-httpbis-message-signatures-04.html">As of version 04</a> though, the major surgery seems to be behind us. While there will inevitably be some changes to the parameters, names, and possibly even structures, the core of this is pretty solid. It’s time to start implementing it and testing it out with applications of all stripes, and I invite all of you to join me in doing just&nbsp;that.</p>

     <p>Source: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/wendykimsmith/">Wendy Smith</a>&nbsp; https://www.learninginnovationslab.org/guest-faculty/</p><br><p>The importance of creating or seeing a paradox is that you can understand that the data and facts being presented to you can lead to the recommendation or conclusion being offered, but equally that the same data and facts can equally lead to a different conclusion.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Our problem is that we are not very good at finding flaws in our own arguments, if for no other reason than they support our incentives and beliefs. We tend to take it personally when someone attacks our logic, beliefs or method, even if they are searching for the paradox. Equally, the person you are about to question reacts just like you do.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Searching for the paradox allows you to see the jumps, assumptions and framing in the logic being presented, which lays bare how our thinking and decisions are being manipulated.&nbsp; Often it turns out, others are blinded to see one conclusion, and as a leader and executive, your role is to explore and question the flow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Logical flow decisions often create paradoxes because of an invalid argument, but they are nevertheless valuable in creating a narrative. We see this as a statement or proposition which, despite sound (or apparently sound) reasoning from acceptable premises, leads to a conclusion that seems logically unacceptable or self-contradictory.&nbsp; Finding a paradox in non-logical flow decisions reveals errors in definitions that were assumed to be rigorous. Equally,&nbsp; a paradox can be seen when a seemingly absurd or contradictory statement or proposition, which when investigated, proves to be well-founded or true. &nbsp; What is evident is the need for critical thinking, questions and sensitivity.&nbsp;</p><p>Just because an idea pops into your head during a presentation doesn’t mean it’s true or reasonable. Idea bias is a new skinny belief you have just created, leading you to poor decision making as you have been framed. Often in a meeting, the framing is such that the presenter has set up a story or analogy which you believe in and fail to create new questions about (idea bias); as a way to make the logic jumps needed to justify a story.&nbsp; If you cannot see the paradox, you are in their model, which means you are unlikely to make an unbiased decision.&nbsp; If you can see the paradox you have mastered critical thinking and can use tools to ensure you make decisions that lead to outcomes that you want.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;If you cannot see the paradox, you are in a model.</p><br><p>Decision-making framing itself create paradox’s for us&nbsp;</p>  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevention_paradox">Prevention paradox</a>: For one person to benefit, many people have to change their behaviour — even though they receive no benefit or even suffer, from the change.&nbsp; An assumption about the adoption of a product.</p>  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making_paradox">Decision-making paradox</a>: Picking “the best decision-making method” is a decision problem in itself.

     <br><p>I know the journey is more important than the destination, but destinations provide an essential point as they mark somewhere to head towards.&nbsp; All journeys start with a single step, and for me, this journey started a little over three years ago. I have spent this past period considering the question, “How do we make Better Decisions.” This question was refined to become “How do we make Better Decisions with data.” This expanded into “How do we make Better Decisions with data and be better ancestors?”&nbsp; My journey can finally see a destination.&nbsp;</p><p>However, I am now facing a more significant challenge.</p><p>Having reached the destination zone, I want to leave a mark, and it's straightforward to imagine planting a flag. The hope is that when the flag is planted some of the team back at home can see that you've reached the final place.&nbsp; In most circumstances, the destination is not in the Line-of-Sight. Therefore you pick up the flag and wave it, hoping that somebody with binoculars can see you waving your destination flag. If someone sees you, they relay it to the others that the advance party or pioneers (risk-takers and general nutters) have reached the destination. In innovation and invention land, you're tempted to stay at the destination, hoping that the others will follow you to the same place. Waiting there means you eventually run out of resources, this being cash or budget. Having run out of resources, you're faced with the reality you have to head back to where everyone else is as nobody is going to follow you to the destination; it is too risky.&nbsp; On arriving back at home, there's a bit of a party and a celebration. You relay your stories about the journey and how wonderful the destination is. &nbsp; After a few hours of partying, everybody heads back to their homes, leaving you wondering how to persuade others to go to the destination as well.</p><p>There are a series of videos on YouTube of a single dancer who starts to dance to music, and over periods of 5-minutes to several hours, the dancing crowd grows until everybody is dancing. Early adopters and supporters join the pioneer, and eventually, they are joined by the followers who make the crowd. (2021 #covid19 note, what is a crowd and what is a party?)</p><p>The next day after your return, everybody gets up and goes around their jobs and business as usual.&nbsp; What is now needed is to convert the excitement of the destination into a language and story that the first supporters and early adopters can relate to and join in. What is tremendously difficult is constructing a straightforward linear narrative and step actions, meaning the crowd can also join in and desire to get to a new destination. (crossing the chasm)&nbsp; For businesses right now, this is the digital transformation, data, circular economy, ESG, climate change, AI, ethics and sustainability.&nbsp; The pioneers have been to the destination, planted the flags, imagined the better fruits, but we have to drop the complexity of the issues and find a better story for us all to get there.</p><p>The journey I have been on for the last few years is understanding how we make better decisions.&nbsp; This means I have had to unpack numerous topics and dependencies deep in the messiness of models and complexity. Unsurprisingly there are only a few who are also motivated about understanding the complexity and philiosphy of better decisions, it is my burden. We are converting what we have found at the destination (how to make better decisions with data and be better ancestors) into a language that fellow supporters and early adopters can engage with and discuss.&nbsp;</p><p>BUT</p><p>I am now desperate for expert support to convert the ideas into straightforward narrative and actions that the crowd in the town can take on board and start their journey, but knowing where they are going has been discovered. My struggle is that I find it hard to dumb down the complex into a tweet as it cannot possibly embrace the complexity. I continually flight myself as I can see the simple is not truly representative. The PhD virologist of 30 years is given 1 minute to explain virus mutation on the news.&nbsp; The simple becomes fodder to the vocal and easily upset in social media land as it is easily misunderstood and taken out of context. I spend more time trying to justify (to myself) why I am using simple concepts to explain complex ideas.</p><p></p><p>Tribe, I need some help.&nbsp; Is there anybody out there (a nod to Pink Floyd) who is willing to spend the time in a small community helping to refine the words, language, stories, ideas and concepts into a straightforward linear narrative that portrays actions and activities, which means we can all take steps on a journey to making Better Decisions? This is not a job it is a vocation. Journeys are so much more fun when we do them together, and the next part of the journey is to do it all together. I'm looking for early adopter and supporters who can share their destinations so that together we can create a better narrative about decision making, governance and oversight.&nbsp;</p><p>Are you willing and able to help form and write a narrative to enable others to come on our journey?</p> <br>

   <p></p><p>In commercial land, the axis of power has tended to rest with the CEO/ CFO relationship. &nbsp; There is always a myriad of other political triangles that lobby and wrestle for power and sway decisions.&nbsp; Given that decisions are increasingly reliant on evidence which is data, the CDO gets dragged into everyone's battles, which are not always in the best interest of the business, customer, ecosystem or society - such are incentive scheme.</p><p>Everyone else in the senior team does not want to recognise is that the data they use as evidence and proof is equally supportive or detrimental to everyone else's cause.&nbsp; Whilst everyone else on the leadership team gets to pick and bias what they foreground and promote, the CDO has to keep their mind open and judge all data with the same level of critical thinking.&nbsp; This tends to mean the CDO becomes the punch bag when data either supports or otherwise a decision, which in reality is a political lobby for power which the data may not fully support. However, we are all fallible, and data is not the evidence we want it to be.&nbsp;</p><p>we are all fallible, and data is not the evidence we want it to be.&nbsp;</p><p>Given that even the most highly skilled data scientists, who were incentivised to come to the most accurate results, can create a broad range of conclusions, even when given the same data and hypothesis.&nbsp; This means that senior leadership teams don’t know if the data they have and the conclusion they have reached is correct.&nbsp;</p><p>A recent and significant published <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/metaarxiv/cd5j9/">paper</a> gave 73 teams the same data and research question. The answers varied widely, and very little variation was easily explained. What the paper goes on to say is that competencies and potential confirmation biases do not explain the broad variation in outcomes.&nbsp;</p><br><p></p><br><p>The paper concludes that if any given study had been conducted by a different (set of) researcher(s), perhaps even the same researchers at a different time, its results may well have varied for reasons that cannot be reduced to easily observable analytical choices or biases.&nbsp; They conclude that steps in the research process remain undisclosed in the standard presentation and consumption of scientific results and have exposed a “hidden universe” of idiosyncratic research and researcher variability. An important takeaway here is that the reality of researcher decisions cannot easily be simulated.</p><p>Therefore, there are at least two forces at play in data leading to a recommendation or decision.&nbsp; One, the bias and foregrounding of data outcomes by a member of the leadership team is for a reason. Two. the same data, same tools, the same team can generate more than one recommendation.&nbsp; How to determine what is at play is a modern-day skill the CDO must-have.&nbsp;</p><p>As the CDO, you have to gain the trust of all your senior team and work with them to determine what is incentive biased, desired outcome-driven, seeking support or driven from the data set where there is naturally more than one possible conclusion.&nbsp; In doing this, you have to be capable of assessing the alignment or divergence from others in the team who have come to different conclusions. &nbsp; This becomes more complex if the data set is public, purchased, or gathered from the ecosystem with partners, as others outside of the organisation can create different conclusions. You have to be prepared to justify your reason, rationale and processes. &nbsp; The skill you need to demonstrate is one of consistency in finding a route to align any data conclusions to the company's purpose and agreed strategic goals and not to the forces of lobby. Leave those calls to the CEO knowing the CEO has your back or get out, as being the new corporate punch bag is not fun.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p>Note to the CEO</p><p>Each leadership team member is playing their own game and is looking to the CDO to find and support data for their cause, lobby, decision or budget.&nbsp; This means that the CDO becomes the corporate punch bag and police, taking over from HR. The CDO has to navigate the path of varying conclusions and desired outcomes from the same data set, which are in conflict as they meet individuals agendas. &nbsp; As the CEO, you have to be aware of this and the game your CFO will play.&nbsp; The power axis itself of the CEO/ CFO relationship comes under stress as the CDO can give you more insights into decisions “presented because of incentives and self-interest” than anyone else, but HR will still want to own it.&nbsp; If you alienate the CDO, you will lose that linkage, which is exactly what others want.&nbsp; However, first, check that the CDO has this trust of the team and that your CDO has the capability and capacity to manage this modern-day leadership challenge.&nbsp; If not, it might be time to upgrade your CDO with new skills or find a new version.&nbsp;</p><br><br><br><br>

<p>Today marks an important milestone in the life of the OpenID Foundation and the worldwide digital identity community.  Following <a href="https://openid.net/2021/02/19/resolution-thanking-don-thibeau-for-his-service/">Don Thibeau’s decade of exemplary service to the OpenID Foundation as its Executive Director</a>, today we <a href="https://openid.net/2021/04/28/welcoming-gail-hodges-as-our-new-executive-director/">welcomed Gail Hodges as our new Executive Director</a>.</p>
<p>Don was instrumental in the creation of <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a>, the <a href="https://openidentityexchange.org/">Open Identity Exchange</a>, the <a href="https://openid.net/certification/">OpenID Certification</a> program, the <a href="https://fapi.openid.net/">Financial-grade API (FAPI)</a>, and its ongoing worldwide adoption.  He’s created and nurtured numerous liaison relationships with organizations and initiatives advancing digital identity and user empowerment worldwide.  And thankfully, Don intends to stay active in digital identity and the OpenID Foundation, including supporting Gail in her new role.</p>
<p>Gail’s <a href="https://twitter.com/gailhodges">Twitter</a> motto is “Reinventing identity as a public good”, which I believe will be indicative of the directions in which she’ll help lead the OpenID Foundation.  She has extensive leadership experience in both digital identity and international finance, as described in her <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gail-hodges-26b1b9/">LinkedIn profile</a>.  The board is thrilled to have her on board and looks forward to what we’ll accomplish together in this next exciting chapter of the OpenID Foundation!</p>
<p>I encourage all of you to come meet Gail at the <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/openid-foundation-virtual-workshop-tickets-143831524963">OpenID Foundation Workshop tomorrow</a>, where she’ll introduce herself to the OpenID community.</p>

<p>If there's one thing that's true about the word "blockchain", it's that
these days people have strong opinions about it.
Open your social media feed and you'll see people either heaping praises
on blockchains, calling them the saviors of humanity, or condemning them
as destroying and burning down the planet and making the rich richer
and the poor poorer and generally all the other kinds of fights that
people like to have about capitalism (also a quasi-vague word
occupying some hotly contested mental real estate).</p>
<p>There are good reasons to hold opinions about various aspects of what
are called "blockchains", and I too have some pretty strong opinions
I'll be getting into in a followup article.
The followup article will be about "cryptocurrencies", which many people
also seem to think of as synonymous with "blockchains", but this isn't
particularly true either, but we'll deal with that one then.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, some of the fighting on the internet is kind of
confusing, but even more importantly, kind of confused.
Some of it might be what I call "sportsballing": for whatever reason,
for or against blockchains has become part of your local sportsball
team, and we've all got to be team players or we're gonna let the local
team down already, right?
And the thing about sportsballing is that it's kind of arbitrary and
it kind of isn't, because you might pick a sportsball team because you
did all your research or you might have picked it because that just
happens to be the team in your area or the team your friends like, but
god almighty once you've picked your sportsball team let's actually not
talk against it because that might be giving in to the other side.
But sportsballing kind of isn't arbitrary either because it tends to
be initially connected to real communities of real human beings and
there's usually a deeper cultural web than appears at surface level,
so when you're poking at it, it appears surface-level shallow but
there are some real intricacies beneath the surface.  (But anyway, go
sportsball team.)</p>
<p>But I digress.
There are important issues to discuss, yet people aren't really
discussing them, partly because people mean different things.
"Blockchain" is a strange term that encompasses a wide idea space,
and what people consider or assume essential to it vary just as
widely, and thus when two people are arguing they might not even be
arguing about the same thing.
So let's get to unpacking.</p>
 "Blockchain" as handwaving towards decentralized networks in general 
<p>Years ago I was at a conference about decentralized networked
technology, and I was having a conversation with someone I had just met.
This person was telling me how excited they were about
blockchains... finally we have decentralized network designs, and so
this seems really useful for society!</p>
<p>I paused for a moment and said yes, blockchains can be useful for some
things, though they tend to have significant costs or at least
tradeoffs.  It's good that we also have other decentralized network
technology; for example, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">ActivityPub</a>
standard I was involved in had no blockchains but did rely on the
much older "classic actor model."</p>
<p>"Oh," the other person said, "I didn't know there were other kinds of
decentralized network designs.  I thought that 'blockchain' just meant
'decentralized network technology'."</p>
<p>It was as if a light had turned on and illuminated the room for me.  Oh!
This explained so many conversations I had been having over the years.
Of course... for many people, blockchains like Bitcoin were the first
ever exposure they had (aside from email, which maybe they never gave
much thought to as being decentralized) of something that involved
a decentralized protocol.  So for many people, "blockchain" and
"decentralized technology" are synonyms, if not in technical design,
but in terms of understanding of a space.</p>
<p>Mark S. Miller, who was standing next to me, smiled and gave a very
interesting followup: "There is only one case in which you need a
blockchain, and that is in a decentralized system which needs to
converge on a single order of events, such as a public ledger
dealing with the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-spending#Decentralized_currencies">double spending problem</a>."</p>
<p>Two revelations at once.  It was a good conversation... it was a good
start.
But I think there's more.</p>
 Blockchains are the "cloud" of merkle trees 
<p>As time has gone on, the discourse over blockchains has gotten more
dramatic.  This is partly because what a "blockchain" is hasn't been
well defined.</p>
<p>All terminology exists on an ever-present battle between
<a href="https://fossandcrafts.org/episodes/23-nerdout-fuzzy-and-crisp.html">fuzziness and crispness</a>,
with some terms being much clearer than others.
The term "boolean" has a fairly crisp definition in computer science,
but if I ask you to show me your "stove", the device you show me today
may be incomprehensible to someone's definition a few centuries ago,
particularly in that today it might not involve fire.
Trying to define as in terms of its functionality can also cause
confusion: if I asked you to show me a stove, and you showed me a
computer processor or a car engine, I might be fairly confused, even
though technically people enjoy showing off that they can cook eggs on
both of these devices when they get hot enough.
(See also: <a href="https://dustycloud.org/blog/identity-is-a-katamari/">Identity is a Katamari, language is a Katamari explosion</a>.)</p>
<p>Still, some terms are fuzzier than others, and as far as terms go,
"blockchain" is quite fuzzy.
Hence my joke: "Blockchains are the 'cloud' of merkle trees."</p>
<p>This ~joke tends to get a lot of laughs out of a particular kind of
audience, and confused looks from others, so let me explain.
The one thing everyone seems to agree on is that it's a "chain of
blocks", but all that really seems to mean is that it's a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree">merkle tree</a>... really,
just an immutable datastructure where one node points at the parent node
which points at the parent node all the way up.
The joke then is not that this merkle tree runs on a cloud, but that
"cloud computing" means approximately nothing: it's marketing speak for
some vague handwavey set of "other peoples' computers are doing
computation somewhere, possibly on your behalf sometimes."
Therefore, "cloud of merkle trees" refers to the vagueness of the
situation.
(As everyone knows, jokes are funnier when fully explained, so I'll
turn on my "STUDIO LAUGHTER" sign here.)</p>
<p>So, a blockchain is a chain of blocks, ie a merkle tree, and I mean,
technically speaking, that means that <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> is a
blockchain (especially if the commits are signed), but when you see
someone arguing on the internet about whether or not blockchains are
"good" or "bad", they probably weren't thinking about git, which aside
from having a high barrier of entry in its interface and some concerns
about the hashing algorithm used, isn't really something likely to
drag you into an internet flamewar.</p>
 "Blockchain" is to "Bitcoin" what "Roguelike" is to "Rogue" 
<p>These days it's common to see people either heaping praises on
blockchains or criticizing them, and those people tend to be shouting
past one another.
I'll save unpacking that for another post.
In the meanwhile though, it's worth noting that people might not be
talking about the same things.</p>
<p>What isn't in doubt is whether or not
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a>
is a blockchain... trying to understand and then explore the problem
space around Bitcoin is what created the term "blockchain".
It's a bit like the video game genre of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike">roguelikes</a>,
which started with the game
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_%28video_game%29">Rogue</a>,
particularly explored and expanded upon in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetHack">NetHack</a>,
and then suddenly exploding into the indie game scene as a "genre"
of its own.
Except the genre has become fuzzier and fuzzier as people have explored
the surrounding space.
What is essential?
Is a grid based layout essential?
Is a <a href="http://roguetemple.com/z/hyper/">non-euclidean grid</a> acceptable?
Do you have to provide an ascii or ansi art interface so people can play
in their terminals?
Dare we allow unicode characters?
What if we throw out terminals altogether and just play on a grid
of 2d pixelart?
What about 3d art?
What about permadeath?
What about the fantasy theme?
What about random level generation?
What are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike#Key_features">key features</a>
of a roguelike?</p>
<p>Well now we're at the point where I pick up a game like
<a href="https://blazingbeaks.fandom.com/wiki/Blazing_Beaks_Wiki">Blazing Beaks</a>
and it calls itself a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike#Rogue-lites_and_procedural_death_labyrinths">"roguelite"</a>,
which I guess is embracing the point that terminology has gotten extremely
fuzzy... this game feels more like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotron">Robotron</a>
than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_%28video_game%29">Rogue</a>.</p>
<p>So... if "blockchain" is to Bitcoin what "roguelike" is to Rogue, then
what's essential to a blockchain?
Does the blockchain have to be applied to a financial instrument, or
can it be used to store updateable information about eg identity?
Is global consensus required?
Or what about a "trusted quorum" of nodes, such as in Hyperledger?
Is "mining" some kind of asset a key part of the system?
Is proof of work acceptable, or is proof of stake okay?
What about proof of space, proof of space-time, proof of pudding?</p>
<p>On top of all this, some of the terms around blockchains have been
absorbed as if into them.
For instance, I think to many people, "smart contract" means something
like "code which runs on a blockchain" thanks to Ethereum's major
adoption of the term, but the
<a href="http://www.erights.org/">E programming language</a>
described "smart contracts" as the "likely killer app of distributed
capabilities" all the way
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990125095122/http://www.erights.org/">back in 1999</a>,
and was
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990209105758/http://www.best.com/%7Eszabo/smart_contracts_idea.html">borrowing the term</a>
from
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990128165611/http://www.best.com/%7Eszabo/">Nick Szabo</a>,
but really the same folks working on E had described many of those same
ideas in the <a href="https://agoric.com/papers/">Agoric Papers</a> back in 1988.
Bitcoin wasn't even a thing at all until at least 2008, so depending on
how you look at it, "smart contracts" precede "blockchains" by one or
two decades.
So "blockchain" has somehow even rolled up terms outside of its space
as if within it.
(By the way, I don't think anyone has given a good and crisp definition
for "smart contract" either despite some of these people trying to give
me one, so let me give you one that I think is better and embraces its
fuzziness: "Smart contracts allow you to do the kinds of things you
might do with legal contracts, but relying on networked computation
instead of a traditional state-based legal system."
It's too bad more people also don't know about the huge role that Mark
Miller's "split contracts" idea plays into this space because that's
what makes the idea finally makes sense... but that's a conversation
for another time.)
(EDIT: Well, after I wrote this, Kate Sills lent me her
definition, which I think is the best one: "Smart contracts are
credible commitments using technology, and outside a state-provided
legal system."  I like it!)</p>
<p>So anyway, the point of this whole section is to say that kind of like
roguelike, people are thinking of different things as essential to
blockchains.
Everyone roughly agrees on the jumping-off point of ideas but since
not everyone agrees from there, it's good to check in when we're having
the conversation.
Wait, you do/don't like this game because it's a roguelike?
Maybe we should check in on what features you mean.
Likewise for blockchains.
Because if you're blaming blockchains for burning down the planet, more
than likely you're not condemning signed git repositories (or at least,
if you're condemning them, you're probably doing so about it from an
aspect that isn't the fundamental datastructure... probably).</p>
<p>This is an "easier said than done" kind of thing though, because of
course, I'm kind of getting into some "in the weeds" level of details
here... but it's the "in the weeds" where all the substance of the
disagreements really are.
The person you are talking with might not actually even know or consider
the same aspects to be essential that you consider essential though,
so taking some time to ask which things we mean can help us lead to a
more productive conversation sooner.</p>
 "Blockchain" as an identity signal 
<p>First, a digression.
One thing that's kind of curious about the term
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtue_signaling">"virtue signal"</a>
is that in general it tends to be used as a kind of virtue signal.
It's kind of like the word
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipster_%28contemporary_subculture%29">hipster</a>
in the previous decade, which weirdly seemed to be obsessively and
pejoratively used by people who resembled hipsters than anyone else.
Hence I used to make a joke called "hipster recursion", which is that
since hipsters seem more obsessesed with pejorative labeling of
hipsterism than anyone else, there's no way to call someone a "hipster"
without yourself taking on hipster-like traits, and so inevitably
even this conversation is N-levels deep into hipster recursion
for some numerical value of N.</p>
<p>"Virtue signaling" appears similar, but even more ironically so
(which is a pretty amazing feat given how much of hipsterdom seems to
surround a kind of inauthentic irony).
When I hear someone say "virtue signaling" with a kind of sneer, part
of that seems to be acknowledging that other people are sending signals
merely to impress others that they are some kind of the same group but
it seems as if it's being raised as in a
you-know-and-I-know-that-by-me-acknowledging-this-I'm-above-virtue-signaling
kind of way.
Except that by any possible definition of virtue signaling, the above
appears to be a kind of virtue signaling, so now we're into virtue
signaling recursion.</p>
<p>Well, one way to claw our way out of the rabbithole of all this is to
drop the pejorative aspect of it and just acknowledge that signaling
is something that everyone does.
Hence me saying "identity signaling" here.
You can't really escape identity signaling, or even sportsballing, but
you can acknowledge that it's a thing that we all do, and there's a
reason for it: people only have so much time to find out information
about each other, so they're searching for clues that they might align
and that, if they introduce you to their peer group, that you might
align with them as well, without access to a god-like view of the
universe where they know exactly what you think and exactly what
kinds of things you've done and exactly what way you'll behave in
the future or whether or not you share the same values.
(After all, what else is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtue_ethics">virtue ethics</a>
but an ethical framework that takes this in its most condensed form as
its foundation?)
But it's true that at its worst, this seems to result in shallow, quick,
judgmental behavior, usually based on stereotypes of the other side...
which can be unfortunate or unfair to whomever is being talked about.
But also on the flip side, people also do identity signal to each other
because they want to create a sense of community and bonding.
That's what a lot of culture is.
It's worth acknowledging then that this occurs, recognizing its use and
limitations, without pretending that we are above it.</p>
<p>So wow, that's quite a major digression, so now let's get back to
"identity signaling".
There is definitely a lot of identity signaling that tends to happen
around the word "blockchain", for or against.
Around the critiques of the worst of this, I tend to agree: I find much
of the machismo hyper-white-male-privilege that surrounds some of the
"blockchain" space uncomfortable or cringey.</p>
<p>But I also have some close friends who are not male and/or are people
of color and those ones tend to actually suffer the worst of it from
these communities internally, but also seem to find things of value in
them, but particularly seem to feel squeezed externally when the field
is reduced to these kinds of (anti?-)patterns.
There's something sad about that, where I see on the one hand friends
complaining about blockchain from the outside on behalf of people who
on the inside seem to be both struggling internally but then kind of
crushed by being lumped into the same identified problems externally.
This is hardly a unique problem but it's worth highlighting for a moment
I think.</p>
<p>But anyway, I've taken a bunch of time on this, more than I care to,
maybe because (irony again?) I feel that too much of public conversation
is also hyperfocusing on this aspect... whether there's a subculture
around blockchain, whether or not that subculture is good or bad, etc.
There's a lot worthwhile in unpacking this discourse-wise, but some of
the criticisms of blockchains as a technology (to the extent it even
is coherently one) seem to get lumped up into all of this.
It's good to provide thoughtful cultural critique, particularly one
which encourages healthy social change.
And we can't escape identity signaling.
But as someone who's trying to figure out what properties of networked
systems we do and don't want, I feel like I'm trying to navigate the
machine and for whatever reason, my foot keeps getting caught in the
gears here.
Well, maybe that itself is pointing to some architectural mistakes,
but socially architectural ones.
But it's useful to also be able to draw boundaries around it so that
we know where this part of the conversation begins and ends.</p>
 "Blockchain" as "decentralized centralization" (or "decentralized convergence") 
<p>One of the weird things about people having the idea of "blockchains" as
being synonymous with "decentralization" is that it's kind of both very
true and very untrue, depending on what abstraction layer you're
looking at.</p>
<p>For a moment, I'm going to frame this in harsh terms: blockchains are
decentralized centralization.</p>
<p>What?
How dare I!
You'll notice that this section is in harsh contrast to the
"blockchain as handwaving towards decentralized networks in general"
section... well, I am acknowledging the decentralized aspect of it,
but the weird thing about a blockchain is that it's a decentralized
set of nodes converging on (creating a centrality of!) a single
abstract machine.</p>
<p>Contrast with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model#Fundamental_concepts">classic actor model</a>
systems like
<a href="http://erights.org/elib/distrib/captp/index.html">CapTP</a>
in <a href="https://spritelyproject.org/#goblins">Spritely Goblins</a>,
or as less good examples
(because they aren't quite as behavior-oriented as they are
correspondence-oriented, usually)
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">ActivityPub</a>
or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol">SMTP</a>
(ie, email).
All of these systems involve decentralized computation and collaboration
stemming from sending messages to actors (aka "distributed objects").
Of CapTP this is especially clear and extreme: computations happen in
parallel across many collaborating machines (and even better, many
collaborating objects on many collaborating machines), and the behavior
of other machines and their objects is often even opaque to you.
(CapTP survives this in a beautiful way, being able to do well on
anonymous, peer to peer, "mutually suspicious" networks.
But maybe read my
<a href="https://spritelyproject.org/news/what-is-captp.html">rambling thoughts about CapTP</a>
elsewhere.)</p>
<p>While to some degree there are some very
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption">clever</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof">tricks</a>
in the world of cryptography where you may be able to get back some of
the opacity, this tends to be very expensive, adding an expensive
component to the already inescapable additional expenses of a
blockchain.
A multi-party blockchain with some kind of consensus
will always, by definition be slower than a single machine operating
alone.</p>
<p>If you are irritated by this framing: good.
It's probably good to be irritated by it at least once, if you can
recognize the portion of truth in it.
But maybe that needs some unpacking to get there.
It might be better to say "blockchains are decentralized convergence",
but I have some other phrasing that might be helpful.</p>
 "Blockchain" as "a single machine that many people run" 
<p>There's value in having a single abstract machine that many people run.
The most famous source of value is in the "double spending problem".
How do we make sure that when someone has money, they don't spend that
money twice?</p>
<p>Traditional accounting solves this with a linear, sequential ledger,
and it turns out that the right solution boils down to the same thing
in computers.
Emphasis on sequential: in order to make sure money balances out
right, we really do have to be able to order things.</p>
<p>Here's the thing though: the double spending problem was in a sense
solved in terms of single-computers a long time ago in the object
capability security community.
<a href="http://erights.org/elib/capability/ode/index.html">Capability-based Financial Instruments</a>
was written about a decade before blockchains even existed and
showed off how to make a "mint" (kind of like a fiat-currency bank)
that can be implemented in about 25 lines of code in the right
architecture (I've <a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblins/-/blob/4f664218c87fa96432a04d0a107618ec36ab9310/goblins/actor-lib/simple-mint.rkt#L13">ported it to Goblins</a>,
for instance) and yet has both distributed accounts and is robust
against corruption on errors.</p>
<p>However, this seems to be running on a "single-computer based
machine", and again operates like a fiat currency.
Anyone can create their own fiat currency like this, and they are
cheap, cheap, cheap (and fast!) to make.
But it does rely on sequentiality to some degree to operate correctly
(avoiding a class of attacks called "re-entrancy attacks").</p>
<p>But this "single-computer based machine" might bother you for a couple
reasons:</p>
 
 
<p>We might be afraid the server might crash and service will be
  interrupted, or worse yet, we will no longer be able to access our
  accounts.</p>
 
 
<p>Or, even if we could trade these on an open market, and maybe
  diversify our portfolio, maybe we don't want to have to trust a
  single operator or even some appointed team of operators... maybe we
  have a lot of money in one of these systems and we want to be sure
  that it won't suddenly vanish due to corruption.</p>
 
 
<p>Well, if our code operates deterministically, then what if from the
same initial conditions (or saved snapshot of the system) we replay
all input messages to the machine?
Functional programmers know: we'll end up with the same result.</p>
<p>So okay, we might want to be sure this doesn't accidentally get
corrupted, maybe for backup reasons.
So maybe we submit the input messages to two computers, and then
if one crashes, we just continue on with the second one until the
other comes up, and then we can restore the first one from the
progress the second machine made while the first one was down.</p>
<p>Oh hey, this is already technically a blockchain.
Except our trust model is that we implicitly trust both machines.</p>
<p>Hm.
Maybe we're now worried that we might have top-down government
pressure to coerce some behavior on one of our nodes, or maybe we're
worried that someone at a local datacenter is going to flip some bits
to make themselves rich.
So we actually want to spread this abstract machine out over three
countries.
So okay, we do that, and now we set a rule agreeing on what all the
series of input messages are... if two of three nodes agree, that's
good enough.
Oh hey look, we've just invented the "small-quorum-style"
blockchain/ledger!</p>
<p>(And yes, you can wire up <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/goblins/index.html">Goblins</a>
to do just this; a hint as to how is seen in the
<a href="https://dustycloud.org/blog/goblins-time-travel-micropreview/">Terminal Phase time travel demo</a>.
Actually, let's come back to that later.)</p>
<p>Well, okay.
This is probably good enough for a private financial asset, but what
about if we want to make something more... global?
Where nobody is in charge!</p>
<p>Well, we could do that too.
Here's what we do.</p>
 
 
<p>First, we need to prevent a "swarming attack" (okay, this is
  generally called a "sybil attack" in the literature, but for a
  multitude of reasons I won't get into, I don't like that term).
  If a global set of peers are running this single abstract machine,
  we need to make sure there aren't invocations filling up the system
  with garbage, since we all basically have to keep that information
  around.
  Well... this is exactly where those proof-of-foo systems come in
  the first time; in fact Proof of Work's origin is in something
  called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashcash">Hashcash</a> which
  was designed to add "friction" to disincentivize spam for email-like
  systems.
  If we don't do something friction-oriented in this category, our
  ledger is going to be too easily filled with garbage too fast.
  We also need to agree on what the order of messages is, so we
  can use this mechanism in conjuction with a consensus algorithm.</p>
 
 
<p>When are new units of currency issued?
  Well, in our original mint example, the person who set up the mint
  was the one given the authority to make new money out of thin air
  (and they can hand out attenuated versions of that authority to
  others as they see fit).
  But what if instead of handing this capability out to individuals
  we handed it out to anyone who can meet an abstract requirement?
  For instance, in <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/zcap-ld/">zcap-ld</a>
  an invoker can be any kind of entity which is specified with
  <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ld-proofs/">linked data proofs</a>,
  meaning those entities can be something other than a single key...
  for instance, what if we delegated to an abstract invoker that was
  specified as being "whoever can solve the state of the machine's current
  proof-of-work puzzle"?
  Oh my gosh!
  We just took our 25-line mint and extended it for mining-style
  blockchains.
  And the fundamental design still applies!</p>
 
 
<p>With these two adjustments, we've created a "public blockchain" akin
to bitcoin.
And we don't need to use proof-of-work for either technically...
we could swap in different mechanisms of friction / qualification.</p>
<p>If the set of inputs are stored as a merkle tree, then all of the
system types we just looked at are technically blockchains:</p>
 
 
<p>A second machine as failover in a trusted environment</p>
 
 
<p>Three semi-trusted machines with small-scale private consensus</p>
 
 
<p>A public blockchain without global trust, with swarming-attack
   resistance and an interesting abstract capability accessible
   to anyone who can meet the abstract requirement (in this case,
   to issue some new currency).</p>
 
 
<p>The difference for choosing any of the above is really a question of:
"what is your trust/failover requirements?"</p>
 Blockchains as time travel plus convergent inputs 
<p>If this doesn't sound believable to you, that you could create
something like a "public blockchain" on top of something like Goblins
so easily, consider how we might extend
<a href="https://dustycloud.org/blog/goblins-time-travel-micropreview/">time travel in Terminal Phase</a>
to add multiplayer.
As a reminder, here's an image:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now, a secret thing about Terminal Phase is that the gameplay is
deterministic (the random starfield in the background is not, but the
gameplay is) and runs on a fixed frame-rate.
This means that given the same set of keyboard inputs, the game will
always play the same, every time.</p>
<p>Okay, well let's say we wanted to hand some way for someone to replay
our last game.
Chess games can be fully replayed with a very
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess)">condensed syntax</a>,
meaning that merely handing someone a short list of codes they can
precisely replay the same game, every time, deterministically.</p>
<p>Well okay, as a first attempt at thinking this through, what if for
some game of Terminal Phase I played we wrote down each keystroke I
entered on my keyboard, on every tick of the game?
Terminal Phase runs at 30 ticks per second.
So okay, if you replay these, each one at 30 ticks per second, then
yeah, you'd end up with the same gameplay every time.</p>
<p>It would be simple enough for me to encode these as a linked list
(cons, cons, cons!) and hand them to you.
You could descend all the way to the root of the list and start
playing them back up (ie, play the list in reverse order) and you'd
get the same result as I did.
I could even stream new events to you by giving you new items to
tack onto the front of the list, and you could "watch" a game I
was playing live.</p>
<p>So now imagine that you and I want to play Terminal Phase together
now, over the network.
Let's imagine there are two ships, and for simplicity, we're playing
cooperatively.
(The same ideas
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockstep_protocol">can be extended to competitive</a>,
but for narrating how real-time games work it's easier to to start
with a cooperative assumption.)</p>
<p>We could start out by wiring things up on the network so that I am
allowed to press certain keys for player 1 and you are allowed to
press certain keys for player 2.
(Now it's worth noting that a better way to do this doesn't involve
keys on the keyboard but capability references, and really that's
how we'd do things if we were to bring this multiplayer idea live, but
I'm trying to provide a metaphor that's easy to think about without
introducing the complicated sounding kinds of terms like "c-lists" and
"vat turns" that we ocap people seem to like.)
So, as a first attempt, maybe if we were playing on a local area
network or something, we could synchronize at every game tick: I share
my input with you and you share yours, and then and only then do both
of our systems actually input them into that game-tick's inputs.
We'll have achieved a kind of "convergence" as to the current game state
on every tick.
(EDIT: I wrote "a kind of consensus" instead of "a kind of
convergence" originally, and that was an error, because it misleads
on what consensus algorithms tend to do.)</p>
<p>Except this wouldn't work very well if you and I were living far away
from each other and playing over the internet... the lag time for
doing this for every game tick might slow the system to a crawl...
our computers wouldn't get each others' inputs as fast as the game was
moving along, and would have to pause until we received each others'
moves.</p>
<p>So okay, here's what we'll do.
Remember the time-travel GUI above?
As you can see, we're effectively restoring from an old snapshot.
Oh!  So okay.
We could save a snapshot of the game every second, and then both get
each other our inputs to each other as fast as we can, but knowing
it'll lag.
So, without having seen your inputs yet, I could move my ship up and
to the right and fire (and send that I did that to you).
My game would be in a "dirty state"... I haven't actually seen what
you've done yet.
Now suddenly I get the last set of moves you did over the network...
in the last five frames, you move down and to the left and fire.
Now we've got each others' inputs... what our systems can do is
secretly time travel behind the scenes to the last snapshot, then
fast forward, replaying both of our inputs on each tick up until the
latest state where we've both seen each others' moves (but we wouldn't
show the fast forward process, we'd just show the result with the
fast forward having been applied).
This can happen fast enough that I might see your ship jump forward
a little, and maybe your bullet will kill the enemy instead of mine
and the scores shift so that you actually got some points that
for a moment I thought I had, but this can all happen in realtime
and we don't need to slow down the game at all to do it.</p>
<p>Again, all the above can be done, but with actual wiring of
capabilities instead of the keystroke metaphor... and actually, the
same set of ideas can be done with any kind of system, not just
a game.</p>
<p>And oh hey, technically, technically, technically if we both hashed
each of our previous messages in the linked list and signed each one,
then this would qualify as a merkle tree and then this would also
qualify as a blockchain... but wait, this doesn't have anything to do
with cryptocurrencies!
So is it really a blockchain?</p>
 "Blockchain" as synonym for "cryptocurrency" but this is wrong and don't do this one 
<p>By now you've probably gotten the sense that I really was annoyed with
the first section of "blockchain" as a synonym for "decentralization"
(especially because blockchains are decentralized centralization/convergence)
and that is completely true.
But even more annoying to me is the synonym of "blockchain" with
"cryptocurrency".</p>
<p>"Cryptocurrency" means "cryptographically based currency" and it is
NOT synonymous with blockchains.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DigiCash">Digicash</a> precedes blockchains
by a dramatic amount, but it is a cryptocurrency.
The "simple mint" type system also precedes blockchains and while it
can be run on a blockchain, it can also run on a solo
computer/machine.</p>
<p>But as we saw, we could perceive multiplayer Terminal Phase as
technically, technically a blockchain, even though it has nothing to do with
currencies whatsoever.</p>
<p>So again a blockchain is just a single, abstract, sequential machine,
run by multiple parties.
That's it.
It's more general than cryptocurrencies, and it's not exclusive to
implementing them either.
One is a kind of programming-plus-cryptography-use-case
(cryptocurrencies), the other one is a kind of abstracted machine
(blockchains).</p>
<p>So please.
They are frequently combined, but don't treat them as the same thing.</p>
 Blockchains as single abstract machines on a wider network 
<p>One of my favorite talks is Mark Miller's
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXUqfgdDbr8">Programming Secure Smart Contracts</a>
talk.
Admittedly, I like it partly because it well illustrates some of the
low-level problems I've been working on, and that might not be as
useful to everyone else.
But it has this lovely diagram in it:</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is better understood by watching the video, but the abstraction
layers described here are basically as follows:</p>
 
 
<p>"Machines" are the lowest layer of abstraction on the network, but
   there a variety of kinds of machines.
   Public blockchains are one, quorum blockchains are another, solo
   computer machines yet another (and the simplest case, too).
   What's interesting then is that we can see public chains and quorums
   abstractly demonstrated as machines in and of themselves... even though
   they are run by many parties.</p>
 
 
<p>Vats are the next layer of abstraction, these are basically the
   "communicating event loops"... actors/objects live inside them,
   and more or less these things run sequentially.</p>
 
 
<p>Replace "JS ocaps" with "language ocaps" and you can see actors/objects
   in both Javascript and Spritely living here.</p>
 
 
<p>Finally, at the top are "erights" and "smart contracts", which feed
   into each other... "erights" are "exclusive electronic rights", and
   "smart contracts" are generally patterns of cooperation involving
   achieving mutual goals despite suspicion, generally involving the
   trading of these erights things (but not necessarily).</p>
 
 
<p>Okay, well cool!
This finally explains the worldview I see blockchains on.
And we can see a few curious things:</p>
 
 
<p>The "public chain" and "quorum" kinds of machines still boil down
   to a single, sequential abstract machine.</p>
 
 
<p>Object connections exist between the machines... ocap security.
   No matter whether it's run by a single computer or multiple.</p>
 
 
<p>Public blockchains, quorum blockchains, solo-computer machines
   all talk to each other, and communicate between object references
   on each other.</p>
 
 
<p>Blockchains are not magical things.
They are abstracted machines on the network.
Some of them have special rules that let whoever can prove they qualify
for them access some well-known capabilities, but really they're just
abstracted machines.</p>
<p>And here's an observation: you aren't ever going to move all
computation to a single blockchain.
Agoric's CEO, Dean Tribble,
<a href="https://youtu.be/WeRbY6tiAio?t=712">explained beautifully why on a recent podcast</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the problems with Ethereum is it is as tightly coupled as
possible.
The entire world is a single sequence of actions that runs on a
computer with about the power of a cell phone.
Now, that's obviously hugely valuable to be able to do commerce in a
high-integrity fashion, even if you can only share a cell phone's
worth of compute power with the entire rest of the world.
But that's clearly gonna hit a brick wall.
And we've done lots of large-scale distributed systems whether
payments or cyberspace or coordination, and the fundamental model
that covers all of those is
islands of sequential programming in a sea of asynchronous communication.
That is what the internet is about, that's what the interchain is about,
that's what physics requires you to do if you want a system to scale.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Put this way, it should be obvious: are we going to replace the entire
internet with something that has the power of a cell phone?
To ask the question is to know the answer: of course not.
Even when we do admit blockchain'y systems into our system, we're going
to have to have many of them communicating with each other.</p>
<p>Blockchains are just machines that many people/agents run.
That's it.</p>
<p>Some of these are encoded with some nice default programming to do
some useful things, but all of them can be done in non-blockchain
systems because
communicating islands of sequential processes is the generalization.
You might still want a blockchain, ie you might want multiple parties
running one of those machines as a shared abstract machine, but
how you configure that blockchain from there might depend on your
trust and integrity requirements.</p>
 What do I think of blockchains? 
<p>I've covered a wide variety of perspectives of "what is a blockchain"
in this article.</p>
<p>On the worse end of things are the parts involving hand-wavey
confusion about decentralization, mistaken ideas of them being tied to
cryptocurrencies, marketing hype, cultural assumptions, and some real,
but not intrinsic, cultural problems.</p>
<p>In the middle, I am particularly keen on highlighting the similarity
between the term "blockchain" and the term "roguelike", how both of
them might boil down to some key ideas or not, but more importantly
they're both a rough family of ideas that diverge from one highly
influential source (Bitcoin and Rogue respectively).
This is also the source of much of the "shouting past each other",
because many people are referring to different components that they
view as essential or inessential.
Many of these pieces may be useful or harmful in isolation, in small
amounts, in large amounts, but much of the arguing (and posturing)
involves highlighting different things.</p>
<p>On the better end of things is a revelation, that blockchains are just
another way of abstracting a computer so that multiple parties can run
it.
The particular decisions and use cases layered on top of this
fundamental design are highly variant.</p>
<p>Having made the waters clear again, we could muddy them.
A friend once tried to convince me that all computers are
technically blockchains, that blockchains are the generalization of
computing, and the case of a solo computer is merely one where a
blockchain is run only by one party and no transaction history or old
state is kept around.
Maybe, but I don't think this is very useful.
You can go in either direction, and I think the time travel and
Terminal Phase section maybe makes that clear to me, but I'm not so
sure how it lands with others I suppose.
But a term tends to be useful in terms of what it introduces, and
calling everything a blockchain seems to make the term even less
useful than it already is.
While a blockchain could be one or more parties running a sequential
machine as the generalization, I suggest we stick to two or more.</p>
<p>Blockchains are not magic pixie dust, putting something on a
blockchain does not make it work better or more
decentralized... indeed, what a blockchain really does is converging
(or re-centralizing) a machine from a decentralized set of computers.
And it always does so with some cost, some set of overhead...
but what those costs and overhead are varies depending on what the
configuration decisions are.
Those decisions should always stem from some careful thinking about
what those trust and integrity needs are... one of the more
frustrating things about blockchains being a technology of great
hype and low understanding is that such care is much less common than
it should be.</p>
<p>Having a blockchain, as a convergent machine, can be useful.
But how that abstracted convergent machine is arranged can diverge
dramatically; if we aren't talking about the same choices, we might
shout past each other.
Still, it may be an unfair ask to request that those without a deep
technical background go into technical specifics, and I recognize
that, and in a sense there can be some amount gained from speaking
towards broad-sweeping, fuzzy sets and the patterns they seem to be
carrying.
A gut-sense assertion from a set of loosely observed behaviors can be
a useful starting point.
But to get at the root of what those gut senses actually map to, we
will have to be specific, and we should encourage that specificity
where we can (without being rude about it) and help others see those
components as well.</p>
<p>But ultimately, as convergent machines, blockchains will not operate
alone.
I think the system that will hook them all together
<a href="https://spritelyproject.org/news/what-is-captp.html">should be CapTP</a>.
But no matter the underlying protocol abstraction, blockchains
are just abstract machines on the network.</p>
<p>Having finally disentangled what blockchains are, I think soon I
would like to move onto what cryptocurrencies are.
Knowing that they are not necessarily tied to blockchains opens us
up to considering an ecosystem, even an interoperable and exchangeable
one, of varying cryptographically based financial instruments, and
the different roles and uses they might play.
But that is another post of its own, for whenever I can get to it,
I suppose.</p>
<p>ADDENDUM: After writing this post, I had several conversations
with several blockchain-oriented people.
Each of them roughly seemed to agree that Bitcoin was roughly the
prototypical "blockchain", but each of them also seemed to highlight
different things they thought were "essential" to what a "blockchain"
is: some kinds of consensus algorithms being better than others, that
kinds of social arrangements are enabled, whether transferrable
assets are encoded on the chain, etc.
To start with, I feel like this does confirm some
of the premise of this post, that Bitcoin is the starting point, but
like Rogue and "roguelikes", "blockchains" are an exploration space
stemming from a particular influential technical piece.</p>
<p>However my friend Kate Sills (who also gave me a much better
definition for "smart contracts", added above) highlighted something
that I hadn't talked about much in my article so far, which I do agree
deserves expansion.
Kate said: "I do think there is something huge missing from your
piece.  Bitcoin is amazing because it aligns incentives among actors
who otherwise have no goals in common."</p>
<p>I agree that there's something important here, and this definition of
"blockchain" maybe does explain why while from a computer science
perspective, perhaps signed git trees do resemble blockchains, they
don't seem to fit within the realm of what most people are thinking
about... while git might be a tool used by several people with aligned
incentives, it is not generally itself the layer of
incentive-alignment.</p>

<p>This blog is the script of a talk I did internally at WSO2 in 2015 to inspire the team to build their personal brand. Found this today, buried in my Google Docs, and thought of sharing publicly (unedited), in case if someone finds it&nbsp;helpful!</p><p>Good Morning folks, thanks for joining in — it’s my great pleasure to do this session on ‘My Personal Brand is My Professional Success&nbsp;Story’.</p><p>First of all I must thank Asanka, Zai, Charitha, Usama and the entire marketing team for giving me the opportunity to present on this topic. In first sight, I thought, it’s tough to present on a topic — that I have not consciously focused on — or purposely wanted to achieve myself. Then again, thinking further on the title, I realized whether we like it or not each one of us has a personal&nbsp;brand.</p><a href="https://miro.medium.com/max/800/1*Yp9bj3XCL0s_fbGWUmGA2g.jpeg">https://miro.medium.com/max/800/1*Yp9bj3XCL0s_fbGWUmGA2g.jpeg</a><p>The personal brand is the image of you, that you cultivate in others’ minds. In other words — that is how — others think about you. This raises a question in all ‘radical’ minds — why we have to care about what others think about us — we do our bit in the way we want, and should we care about personal branding? It is extremely important to find answers to this question, because if we are not convinced of something, we will never do&nbsp;it.</p><p>In my view there are no individuals — there is a bigger, greater team behind each individual. This bigger, greater team includes your parents, siblings, spouse, kids, relations, friends. colleagues and many more. You like it or not, more or less you are a reflection of this team behind you. As we grow up as human beings the team behind us — or the team which influences us, widens up. It would not just include well-wishers, but also haters, competitors and many more. But, still you as an individual is a reflection of this team. Sometimes — or even in most of the cases, the haters could motivate you more than well-wishers. This team also includes people you have never talked to — people you have never seen — people who never exist, like some characters in books. This is the team behind you — at the same time — you like it or not you become a member of a team behind another individual or set of individuals. In other words, you get influenced by a team and then again you influence another set of individuals.</p><p>Let me take a quick example. Everyone knows Mahatma Gandhi. In his own words, Ghandi once said — “Three moderns have left a deep impress on my life and captivated me. Raychandbhai by his living contact; Tolstoy by his book, “The Kingdom of God is within you”; and Ruskin by his “Unto This Last”. That was what influenced him — today there are countless number of individuals who are influenced by&nbsp;Gandhi.</p><p>Arguably, CNBC, in 2014, named Steve Jobs as the most influential person in last 25 years. Thousands of people are influenced by Steve Jobs, at the same time there are many other people who influenced Jobs — Edwin H. Land, who co-founded Polaroid and made a number of significant advancements in the field of photography, is one of them, Jobs used to talk&nbsp;about.</p><p>In short, whether you like it or not, more or less, you get influenced by others and then again you influence others. Now it is a question on how much an impact you want to make on the rest of the world before you die, to make this world a better place than it looks like today.&nbsp;I</p><p>If you want to make a good/positive impact on others, you care about how they think about you. If you cannot build a positive image of you, in their minds, you will find it extremely hard to make a positive impact in their lives. The positive image of you is the reflection of your character. If you have a bad character, it is extremely hard to build a good image out of it, not quite impossible though. But, if your character is good, the positive image is the bonus what you get for it. Personal branding requires, little more than having a good image — you need to learn to express yourself — not to market yourself — but to express yourself. Everyone from the history, who has made a positive impact to the world, have expressed themselves. The way Gandhi took to express himself, is not the same which Steve Jobs&nbsp;picked.</p><p>The rest of the talk from here onwards, is about, how to build a good image and then how to express your character to the rest, to build a positive personal&nbsp;brand.</p><p>In my view, everyone of us, should have a vision for the life. Vision for the life is the one that drives you to the future. The vision for the life is the one that motivates us to wake up every morning. If you don’t have one — start thinking about it from today. Think about, what motivates you to do what you do everyday. Having a good vision is the core in building a great&nbsp;image.</p><p>The vision has to be inspirational — a great vision statement inspires and moves us. It is a motivational force that compels action. You recognize a great vision statement when you find it difficult not to be inspired.</p><p>The vision has to be challenging — the best vision statements challenge us to become better. In this way, a vision statement requires us to stretch ourselves in pursuit of the vision we seek to achieve. The vision is not an ‘easy target’; it is something that if achieved- would represent a sense of pride and fulfillment.</p><p>The vision has to be achievable — vision must not be so far-fetched that is outside of our reach. It must be conceivably possible, though not probable without additional effort.</p><p>When we start working for a company, we get used to spend most of our time working there. If your vision for life does not match with the vision of the company you work for — there could be many conflicts and you won’t be productive. If your vision for life, is to make this world a better place, you cannot work for a company which produces cigarettes or&nbsp;weapons.</p><p>The second most important thing in building a good image, is your integrity. Oprah Winfrey, who is a well-respected TV talk show host, actress, producer and philanthropist, says “Real integrity is doing the right thing, knowing that nobody’s going to know whether you did it or not.”. I don’t think there is a better way of explaining, ‘integrity’ than this. It captures all what it needs to&nbsp;be.</p><p>I have visited and talked with many WSO2 customers over last eight years. We never talk to a customer with an intention of selling a product. First thing we do is listening to them and learn from them, then we all work towards the best solution to the problem they have. Finally we see how WSO2 could fit into the solution. If it is not a perfect fit — we never lie — we identify the gaps — and find a way to move forward by filling those gaps. Most of the time we win the customer at the second stage, when we build the solution for them and in many cases they agree to go ahead with us, even we are not the perfect match for their problem. That is mainly because, the level of integrity we demonstrate as a&nbsp;company.</p><p>No one is perfect — that also implies everyone makes mistakes. A guy with a high level of integrity would never hide mistakes, but rather would accept it, apologize for it and fix it. Never he would lie — never he would say something to one person and something else to another. Mark Twain once said, “If you tell the truth, you don’t have to remember anything.”</p><p>In short, vision for life will drive you to the future, while the integrity is the cornerstone of your personal&nbsp;brand.</p><p>The third most important thing you should do in building a positive image is, to raise yourself against negativity. Do not let negativity kill your productivity, enthusiasm, passion and spirit. People who spread negativity are the people who feel extremely insecure in their current state. They only have complaints — no suggestions. Their feedbacks are negative, not constructive. They see only bad — not a single bit of good. Identifying these type of people are not that hard — first you need to shield yourself from negativity — then you need to protect your team. Even just by keeping silent when hear something negative, you indirectly contributes to spread it over — fix it at that very point. If you are closely following the US presidential election campaign, you might have noticed, Donald Trump, who is the republican front runner at the moment, is being heavily criticized for being silent and not correcting a question raised by someone in his political campaign, where he said — ‘Muslims is a problem and Barack Obama is a Muslim’. Even though Trump is still the frontrunner, his popularity has gone down considerably after these dialogues.</p><p>The fourth most important thing you should do in building a positive image is, when you do something do it to a level where it can make an impact. If you believe something is right, go for it and make it happen. At the end of the day you may fail — but look back and see whether you have contributed to your best — if so, you will never frustrate — no&nbsp;regrets.</p><p>Expressing an idea is important — but representing an idea is much more important. When you represent something you own it. If you want to do something to make an impact, you must own it. You should not be a someone who talks the talk but does not walk the&nbsp;walk.</p><p>Tolerating criticism and accepting constructive feedback, is another key aspect in building a positive image. There are no better sources than criticisms to validate the direction we are heading and to learn. Bill Gates, once said ‘Your most unhappy customers are your greatest source of learning’.</p><p>We discussed so far, the need to build a positive image and how to do it. Next we will focus on how to build a personal brand by expressing yourself. As we discussed before, personal branding requires, little more than having a good image — you need to learn to express yourself — not to market yourself. If you already have a positive image, being little expressive will build you a positive personal brand. If you already have a negative image, being little expressive will build you a negative personal brand. The image you build is a reflection of your character. That includes your role, as a father, son, brother, husband, colleague, friend, mentor, developer, architect and many more. You can build an image as a good father and a bad son — or as a good son and a bad brother — or as a good friend and a bad developer — likewise any combinations. But, more or less, ultimately your true image is how you do overall. You can be the best developer in the company, but then again if you do not understand the value of respecting each other’s religions and cultural values or — in a single word, if you are a racist — your top skills as a developer is worthless.</p><p>You need to pick how you want to impact the world — or how you want the world to see you. Thats your personal brand — and you build it on top of your character or the image. Your overall character is the shelter for your personal brand. If you do not build it right — if you find holes in it — you cannot protect your brand, even from a light shower. That’s why building the right character comes well before building a personal&nbsp;brand.</p><p>In my view, the area you can make the most impact to the world, in its positive direction, is the area that you are most passionate about. If you are extremely worried and angry about child labour — you can be a thought leader in protesting against child labour. If you are extremely worried and angry about human rights violations — you can be a thought leader in protecting human rights. If you are extremely passionate about integration technologies, you can be a thought leader in integration space. If you are extremely passionate about machine learning, you can be a thought leader in machine learning space. If you are passionate about APIs — you can be a thought leader in API space. If you are passionate about Big Data, you can be a thought leader in Big Data space. If you are passionate about Identity and Access Management, you can be a thought leader in Identity and Access Management space. Opportunities are limitless — but remember our ground rules — if you do something — do it to a level where it can make a positive impact. You do not need to worry about being a thought leader, but when you make a good positive impact, you will become a thought leader automatically.</p><p>Once you decide the area where you want to make an impact — the rest depends on how good you as a communicator. Communication is critically important, because, that’s the only way you can reach to your audience. Content marketing is the best way to build a brand and reputation online; when people look for information, they tend to go back to sources that were helpful to them. If you can become a trusted source of information through your content, over time you’ll become collectively known as the expert of your specific field. It’s best to start your own blog and update it on a regular basis — at least weekly. If you do not update regularly you lose your audience. At the start it would be tough — but once you make it a practice, it will start to happen effortlessly. Another key principle I would like to highlight here is the difference between good and great. Most of the time the difference between good and great lies heavily on how you do tiny/little things better. You may spend hours in writing a blog — finding the content — validating the content and getting all in order. But — we are bit lazy to put another more five to ten minutes of effort, to format our blog post, publish it in DZone and other blog aggregators, share it in social media sites — and do little more. This additional ten minutes of effort could easily make your blog post from being a good one to a great one — and also would attract a larger audience.</p><p>Regularly participate in mailing lists related to the subject of your interest is another way of passing your message to the rest of the world. These mailing lists may be within WSO2 or even outside. Look for standard bodies like W3C, IETF, OASIS — and any other communities that share the same interest of yours, and eagerly participate in related discussions. Not just the mailing lists, look for interesting groups in Facebook, LinkedIn, StackOverFlow and wherever possible and make your&nbsp;mark.</p><p>Webinars at WSO2 is another key medium to pass your message to the audience of your interest. If you want to be a thought leader in your product space, then your responsibility does not end at the moment you release the product. You need to come up with a plan for evangelization — and webinars could be extremely helpful.</p><p>At WSO2 you get a massive number of opportunities to build your brand. Your personal brand is important to you as well as, to the company you serve. Few years back, we had a VP of Marketing called Katie Poplin — and I personally got motivated by some of the concepts she put forward. One thing she believed was, in the open source community, brand value of individuals are much higher and trustworthier than that of companies. People used to think, everything a company shares, is part of their marketing propaganda — which may not reflect the real value. But, what individuals share are their first hand experience. Also we had monthly awards for best blogger, best evangelist and the best article. If I remember correctly I won both the best blogger and best evangelist awards in couple of months and it was fun&nbsp;:-).</p><p>Then again don’t just get constrained by the the opportunities you get from WSO2. Always look for what is happening outside. Try to get your articles published in external portals. Also — look for writing books. Writing a book is not hard as it looks to be. First you need to come up with a proposal, with an attractive topic, in your domain of expertise, and then submit it to few publishers. Most of the publishers accept book proposals and if you go to their web sites, you will find everything you need to know, on writing books — go for&nbsp;it!.</p><p>Conferences and meetups are another way to establish yourself as a prominent speaker in the corresponding domain. Then again, getting a speaking opportunity will depend on how better you have done your homework.</p><p>These are only few techniques to build your brand, in the domain you are interested in, on top of your personal image or the character. Building your personal brand is a focused exercise, not just a piece of cake. It’s a journey, not a destination. Once you built it — maintaining it and protecting it is much harder. As we discussed before, your image or the character is the shelter or the shield of your personal brand. If you build your character consciously, that’ll help you in protecting your&nbsp;brand.</p><p>Finally to wrap up, in this session we discussed the importance of brand building, how to build your character and the image, how to build a personal brand under the shelter of your character. Thank you very&nbsp;much.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com/my-personal-brand-is-my-professional-success-story-8460fe351113">My Personal Brand is My Professional Success Story!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com">FACILELOGIN</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

And the costs continue to climb as the drama unfolds with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/04/13/ever-given-seized-egypt/">port authorities and insurers battling over what’s owed to&nbsp;who.</a></p><p>Transmute is a software company — a verifiable credentials as a service company to be exact — and we’ve been focused specifically on the credentials involved in moving steel assets around the globe alongside our <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/interoperability-is-not-a-choice-387d57c6dc32">customers at DHS SVIP and CBP</a> for the last couple years now. Now, there’s no “silver bullet” for mitigating the fiscal impact of the Ever Given on global trade, and ships who arrived the day it got stuck or shortly after certainly faced a tough decision — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/26/business/suez-canal-blocked-ship.html">sail around the Cape of Africa for up to ~$800K [fuel costs alone] + ~26 days to trip or wait it out at an up to $30K per day demurrage expense</a> [without knowing it’d only be stuck for 6 days or ~$180,000].</p><p>So what if you’re a shipping manager and you can make this decision faster? Or, make the call before your ship arrives at the canal? [Some did make this decision, by the way]. What if your goods are stuck on the Ever Given — do you wait it out? Switching suppliers is costly, and you’ve likely got existing contracts in place for much of the cargo. Even if you could fulfill existing contracts and demand on time with a new supplier, what do you do with the delayed cargo expense? What if you’re unsure whether you can sell the duplicate and delayed goods when they reach their originally intended destination?</p><p>Well, verifiable credentials — a special kind of digital document that’s cryptographically provable, timestamped and anchored to an immutable ledger at the very moment in time it’s created — can give companies the kind of data needed to make these sorts of decisions. With use over time for trade data, verifiable credentials build a natural reputation for all the things the trade documents are about: suppliers, products, contracts, ports, regulations, tariffs, time between supply chain handoff points,&nbsp;etc.</p><blockquote>This type of structured data is of such high integrity that supply chain operators can rely on it and feel empowered to make decisions based on&nbsp;it.</blockquote><p>What I’m hoping comes from this global trade disaster is a change in the way supply chain operators make critical decisions. Supply chains of the future will be powered by verifiable credentials, which seamlessly bridge all the data silos that exist today — whether software-created silos or even the paper-based manual, offline&nbsp;silos.</p><p>Today, it’s possible to move from a static, critical chain style of management where we often find ourselves in a reactive position to supply chains that look more like an octopus. High integrity data about suppliers and products enables proactive, dynamic decision making in anticipation of and in real time response to shifts in the market — ultimately capturing more revenue opportunities and mitigating risk at the same&nbsp;time.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/takeaways-from-the-suez-canal-crisis-971f7404b058">Takeaways from the Suez Canal Crisis</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk">Transmute</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>This post will show you step by step how you can let people log in to your website with their own IndieAuth website so you don't need to worry about user accounts or passwords.</p>

<p>What is IndieAuth? IndieAuth is an extension of OAuth 2.0 that enables an individual website like someone's WordPress, Gitea or OwnCast instance to become its own identity provider. This means you can use your own website to sign in to other websites that support IndieAuth.</p>

<p>You can learn more about the differences between IndieAuth and OAuth by reading <a href="https://aaronparecki.com/2018/07/07/7/oauth-for-the-open-web">OAuth for the Open Web</a>.</p>

 What You'll Need 

<p>You'll need a few tools and libraries to sign users in with IndieAuth.</p>

 
 An HTTP client. 
 A URL parsing library. 
 A hashing library that supports SHA256. 
 A library to find <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tags in HTML. 
 The ability to show an HTML form to the user. 
 

 IndieAuth Flow Summary 

<p>Here is a summary of the steps to let people sign in to your website with IndieAuth. We'll dive deeper into each step later in this post.</p>

 
 Present a sign-in form asking the user to enter their server address. 
 Fetch the URL to discover their IndieAuth server. 
 Redirect them to their IndieAuth server with the details of your sign-in request in the query string. 
 Wait for the user to be redirected back to your website with an authorization code in the query string. 
 Exchange the authorization code for the user's profile information by making an HTTP request to their IndieAuth server. 
 

 Step by Step 

<p>Let's dive into the details of each step of the flow. While this is meant to be an approachable guide to IndieAuth, eventually you'll want to make sure to <a href="https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/">read the spec</a> to make sure you're handling all the edge cases you might encounter properly.</p>

 Show the Sign-In Form 

<p>First you'll need to ask the user to enter their server address. You should show a form with a single HTML field, <code>&lt;input type="url"&gt;</code>. You need to know at least the server name of the user's website.</p>

<p>To improve the user experience, you should <a href="https://aaronparecki.com/2018/06/03/4/url-form-field">add some JavaScript</a> to automatically add the <code>https://</code> scheme if the user doesn't type it in.</p>

<p>The form should submit to a route on your website that will start the flow. Here's a complete example of an IndieAuth sign-in form.</p>

 <code>&lt;form action="/indieauth/start" method="post"&gt;
  &lt;input type="url" name="url" placeholder="example.com"&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;input type="submit" value="Sign In"&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code> 

<p>When the user submits this form, you'll start with the URL they enter and you're ready to begin the IndieAuth flow.</p>

 Discover the IndieAuth Server 

<p>There are potentially two URLs you'll need to find at the URL the user entered in order to complete the flow: the authorization endpoint and token endpoint.</p>

<p>The authorization endpoint is where you'll redirect the user to so they can sign in and approve the request. Eventually they'll be redirected back to your app with an authorization code in the query string. You can take that authorization code and exchange it for their profile information. If your app wanted to read or write additional data from their website, such as when creating posts using <a href="https://micropub.net">Micropub</a>, it could exchange that code at the second endpoint (the token endpoint) to get an access token.</p>

<p>To find these endpoints, you'll fetch the URL the user entered (after <a href="https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/#url-canonicalization">validating and normalizing</a> it first) and look for <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tags on the web page. Specifically, you'll be looking for <code>&lt;link rel="authorization_endpoint" href="..."&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;link rel="token_endpoint" href="..."&gt;</code> to find the endpoints you need for the flow. You'll want to use an HTML parser or a <a href="https://indieweb.org/link_rel_parser">link rel parser</a> library to find these URLs.</p>

 Start the Flow by Redirecting the User 

<p>Now you're ready to send the user to their IndieAuth server to have them log in and approve your request.</p>

<p>You'll need to take the authorization endpoint you discovered in the previous request and add a bunch of parameters to the query string, then redirect the user to that URL. Here is the list of parameters to add to the query string:</p>

 
 <code>response_type=code</code> - This tells the server you are doing an IndieAuth authorization code flow. 
 <code>client_id=</code> - Set this value to the home page of your website the user is signing in to. 
 <code>redirect_uri=</code> - This is the URL where you want the user to be returned to after they log in and approve the request. It should have the same domain name as the <code>client_id</code> value. 
 <code>state=</code> - Before starting this step, you should generate a random value for the <code>state</code> parameter and store it in a session and include it in the request. This is for CSRF protection for your app. 
 <code>code_challenge=</code> - This is the base64-urlencoded SHA256 hash of a random string you will generate. We'll cover this in more detail below. 
 <code>code_challenge_method=S256</code> - This tells the server which hashing method you used, which will be SHA256 or S256 for short. 
 <code>me=</code> - (optional) You can provide the URL the user entered in your sign-in form as a parameter here which can be a hint to some IndieAuth servers that support multiple users per server. 
 <code>scope=profile</code> - (optional) If you want to request the user's profile information such as their name, photo, or email, include the scope parameter in the request. The value of the scope parameter can be either <code>profile</code> or <code>profile email</code>. (Make sure to URL-encode the value when including it in a URL, so it will end up as <code>profile+email</code> or <code>profile%20email</code>.) 
 

<p>Calculating the Code Challenge</p>

<p>The Code Challenge is a hash of a secret (called the Code Verifier) that you generate before redirecting the user. This lets the server know that the thing that will later make the request for the user's profile information is the same thing that started the flow. You can see the full details of how to create this parameter <a href="https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/#authorization-request">in the spec</a>, but the summary is:</p>

 
 Create a random string (called the Code Verifier) between 43-128 characters long 
 Calculate the SHA256 hash of the string 
 Base64-URL encode the hash to create the Code Challenge 
 

<p>The part that people most often make a mistake with is the Base64-URL encoding. Make sure you are encoding the raw hash value, not a hex representation of the hash like some hashing libraries will return.</p>

<p>Once you're ready with all these values, add them all to the query string of the authorization endpoint you previously discovered. For example if the user's authorization endpoint is <code>https://indieauth.rocks/authorize</code> because their website is <code>https://indieauth.rocks</code>, then you'd add these parameters to the query string to create a URL like:</p>

 <code>https://indieauth.rocks/authorize?response_type=code
  &amp;client_id=https://example-app.com
  &amp;redirect_uri=https://example-app.com/redirect
  &amp;state=a46a0b27e67c0cb53
  &amp;code_challenge=eBKnGb9SEoqsi0RGBv00dsvFDzJNQOyomi6LE87RVSc
  &amp;code_challenge_method=S256
  &amp;me=https://indieauth.rocks
  &amp;scope=profile
</code> 

<p>Note: The user's authorization endpoint might not be on the same domain as the URL they entered. That's okay! That just means they have delegated their IndieAuth handling to an external service.</p>

<p>Now you can redirect the user to this URL so that they can approve this request at their own IndieAuth server.</p>

 Handle the Redirect Back 

<p>You won't see the user again until after they've logged in to their website and approved the request. Eventually the IndieAuth server will redirect the user back to the <code>redirect_uri</code> you provided in the authorization request. The authorization server will add two query parameters to the redirect: <code>code</code> and <code>state</code>. For example:</p>

 <code>https://example-app.com/redirect?code=af79b83817b317afc9aa
  &amp;state=a46a0b27e67c0cb53
</code> 

<p>First you need to double check that the <code>state</code> value in the redirect matches the <code>state</code> value that you included in the initial request. This is a CSRF protection mechanism. Assuming they match, you're ready to exchange the authorization code for the user's profile information.</p>

 Exchange the Authorization Code for the User's Profile Info 

<p>Now you'll need to make a POST request to exchange the authorization code for the user's profile information. Since this code was returned in a redirect, the IndieAuth server needs an extra confirmation that it was sent back to the right thing, which is what the Code Verifier and Code Challenge are for. You'll make a POST request to the authorization endpoint with the following parameters:</p>

 
 <code>grant_type=authorization_code</code> 
 <code>code=</code> - The authorization code as received in the redirect. 
 <code>client_id=</code> - The same <code>client_id</code> as was used in the original request. 
 <code>redirect_uri=</code> The same <code>redirect_uri</code> as was used in the original request. 
 <code>code_verifier=</code> The original random string you generated when calculating the Code Challenge. 
 

<p>This is described in additional detail <a href="https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/#redeeming-the-authorization-code">in the spec</a>.</p>

<p>Assuming everything checks out, the IndieAuth server will respond with the full URL of the user, as well as their stated profile information if requested. The response will look like the below:</p>

 <code>{
  "me": "https://indieauth.rocks/",
  "profile": {
    "name": "IndieAuth Rocks",
    "url": https://indieauth.rocks/"
    "photo": "https://indieauth.rocks/profile.jpg"
  }
}
</code> 

<p>Wait! We're not done yet! Just because you get information in this response doesn't necessarily mean you can trust it yet! There are two important points here:</p>

 
 The information under the <code>profile</code> object must ALWAYS be treated as user-supplied data, not treated as canonical or authoritative in any way. This means for example not de-duping users based on the <code>profile.url</code> field or <code>profile.email</code> field. 
 If the <code>me</code> URL is not an exact match of the URL the user initially entered, you need to re-discover the authorization endpoint of the <code>me</code> URL returned in this response and make sure it matches exactly the authorization server you found in the initial discovery step. 
 

<p>You can perform the same discovery step as in the beginning, but this time using the <code>me</code> URL returned in the authorization code response. If that authorization endpoint matches the same authorization endpoint that you used when you started the flow, everything is fine and you can treat this response as valid.</p>

<p>This last validation step is critical, since without it, anyone could set up an authorization endpoint claiming to be anyone else's server. More details are available <a href="https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/#authorization-server-confirmation">in the spec</a>.</p>

<p>Now you're done!</p>

<p>The <code>me</code> URL is the value you should use as the canonical and stable identifier for this user. You can use the information in the <code>profile</code> object to augment this user account with information like the user's name or profile information. If the user logs in again later, look up the user from their <code>me</code> URL and update their name/photo/email with the most recent values in the <code>profile</code> object to keep their profile up to date.</p>

 Testing Your IndieAuth Client 

<p>To test your IndieAuth client, you'll need to find a handful of IndieAuth providers in the wild you can use to sign in to it. Here are some to get you started:</p>

 
 <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> - All micro.blog accounts are IndieAuth identities as well. You can use a free account for testing. 
 <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/indieauth/">WordPress</a> - With the IndieAuth plugin installed, a WordPress site can be its own IndieAuth server as well. 
 <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/indieweb">Drupal</a> - The IndieWeb module for Drupal will let a Drupal instance be its own IndieAuth server. 
 <a href="https://indieweb.org/selfauth">Selfauth</a> - Selfauth is a single PHP file that acts as an IndieAuth server. 
 

<p>Eventually I will get around to finishing the test suite at <a href="https://indieauth.rocks">indieauth.rocks</a> so that you have a testing tool readily available, but in the mean time the options above should be enough to get you started.</p>

 Getting Help 

<p>If you get stuck or need help, feel free to drop by the <a href="https://indieweb.org/discuss">IndieWeb chat</a> to ask questions! Myself and many others are there all the time and happy to help troubleshoot new IndieAuth implementations!</p>

   <p>Below are essential characteristics any CDO’s needs, ideal for a job description.

However, complex decisions based on experience, gut instinct, leadership and opinions still play a role, but most decisions can now be underpinned with a firmer foundation.  BE curious&nbsp;about how the business operates and makes money and its drivers of cost, revenue, and customer satisfaction through the lens of data and analytical models.  BE an ambassador&nbsp;of change. Data uncovers assumptions that unpack previous political decisions and moves power. Data does not create change but will create conflict — how this is managed is a critical CDO skill.  BE a great storyteller.  KNOW who&nbsp;is the smartest data scientist in the company, where the most sophisticated models are, and understand and appreciate what those data teams do and how they do it. Managing and getting the best from these teams is a skill everyone needs.  FIGURE out&nbsp;and articulate the value your team can deliver to the business in the next week, month, and quarter. As the CDO, what is the value you bring to your peers and shareholder in the next 5 years?  IMPROVE decision making&nbsp;using data for day to day, how to reduce risk and how to inform the company on achieving and adapting the company’s strategy.  BUILD relationships&nbsp;to source data both within your business and the wider ecosystem. This is both to determine the quality of the data and be able to better use data and or roll out solutions that improve quality and decision-making.  KNOW what technical questions&nbsp;to ask and being able to live with the complexity involved in the delivery.  <p>Decision making is a complex affair, and as CDO’s we are there to support. Decisions are perceived to be easier when there is lots of data, and the signal is big, loud and really clear. Big data has a place, but we must not forget small signals from&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnography">ethnographic data</a>&nbsp;sources. Leadership often does not know what to do with critical and challenging small data, especially when it challenges easy assumptions that big data justifies.</p><blockquote><p>A CDO superpower is to shine a light on all data, without bias</p></blockquote><p>Our superpower is to shine a light on all data, without bias, and help strategic thinkers, who often put a higher value on quantitative data. They didn’t know how to handle data that wasn’t easily measurable does not show up in existing paid-for reports. Ethnographic work has a serious perception problem in a data-driven decision world. A key role of the CDO is to uncover all data and its value, not bias to a bigger data set — that is just lazy. I love this image from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/triciawang/">@triciawang</a>, where the idea of critical small data set is represented as “thick data.” Do follow her work&nbsp;<a href="https://www.triciawang.com/">https://www.triciawang.com/</a>&nbsp;or that of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/genevievebell/">Genevieve Bell</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://katecrawford.net/about.html">Kate Crawford</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.danah.org/">danah boyd&nbsp;</a>(<a href="https://twitter.com/zephoria">@zephoria</a>).</p>          <p>Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/ethnography-matters/why-big-data-needs-thick-data-b4b3e75e3d7">Nokia’s experience of ignoring small data</a></p> Note to the CEO <p>Digital transformation has built a dependence on data, and the bigger the data set, the more weight it is assumed to have. Often, there is a dangerous assumption made that the risk in a decision is reduced because of the data set's size. It may be true for operational issues and automated decision making but not necessarily for strategy.</p><p>As the CEO, you need to determine the half-life of the data used to justify or solidify a decision. Half-life in science is when more than 50 per cent of a substance has undergone a radical change; in business terms, this is when half the value of the data is lost or a doubling of the error. The bigger the data set, the quicker (shorter) the half-life will be. Indeed some data’s half-life is less than the time it took to collect and store it. It is big but it really has no value. For small data sets, such as ethnographic data, the half-life can be longer than a 3 to 5 years strategic planning cycle. Since some data might be small and could be a signal to your future, supporting a CDO who puts equal weight on all data is critical to success.</p>

In their early decades, they served us well, until they didn’t. After the transition to an academy-internal publication economy, powered by ePrint services hosted across the planet, journals will not be missed. That individual academic libraries should need to continue to pony up for thousands of journal subscriptions for decades to come is now an idea only in the Xeroxed business models of for-profit publishers. Everyone else is looking for a way out; and the internet awaits.

<p>Of the deeper thoughts I might give to this moment, I have <a href="https://fossandcrafts.org/episodes/25-governance-leadership-founders-syndrome.html">given them elsewhere</a>.  For this blogpost, I just want to speak of feelings... feelings of hurt and hope.</p>
<p>I am reaching out, collecting the feelings of those I see around me, writing them in my mind's journal.  Though I hold clear positions in this moment, there are few roots of feeling and emotion about the moment I feel I haven't steeped in myself at some time.  Sometimes I tell this to friends, and they think maybe I am drifting from a mutual position, and this is painful for them.  Perhaps they fear this could constitute or signal some kind of betrayal.  I don't know what to say: I've been here too long to feel just one thing, even if I can commit to one position.</p>
<p>So I open my journal of feelings, and here I share some of the pages collecting the pain I see around me:</p>
<p>The irony of a movement wanting to be so logical and above feelings being drowned in them.</p>
<p>The feelings of those who found a comfortable and welcoming home in a world of loneliness, and the split between despondence and outrage for that unraveling.</p>
<p>The feelings of those who wanted to join that home too, but did not feel welcome.</p>
<p>The pent up feelings of those unheard for so long, uncorked and flowing.</p>
<p>The weight and shadow of a central person who seems to feel things so strongly but cannot, and does not care to learn to, understand the feelings of those around them.</p>
<p>I flip a few pages ahead.  The pages are blank, and I interpret this as new chapters for us to write, together.</p>
<p>I hope we might re-discover the heart of our movement.</p>
<p>I hope we can find a place past the pain of the present, healing to build the future.</p>
<p>I hope we can build a new home, strong enough to serve us and keep us safe, but without the walls, moat, and throne of a fortress.</p>
<p>I hope we can be a movement that lives up to our claims: of justice, of freedom, of human rights, to bring these to everyone, especially those we haven't reached.</p>

  <p>I am a (wo)man. I am whole unto myself.</p><p>Hello World.</p><p>Program, or be programmed.&nbsp;</p><p>Own root authority, or be enslaved.</p><p>All relationships in this world are either consented, or enslaved, and often a mixture of those motives. A "civil society" raises the bar on the human condition, or it enslaves it, and methods are driven by a mixture of these motives throughout the lifecycle of relationship management. The literary difference between "THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA" and "CHINA, COMMUNIST PARTY" resolves to the relationship that actually exists between people, and Governed civil society.</p><p>What then is a human being prior to Sovereign affiliation? What do people possess that is unalienable, self-evident, and personally defensible? Life? Liberty? A pursuit of basic happiness? Data integrity? Identity of self, and among chosen peers?</p><p>What happens when the design of a Sovereign relationship forces a person, or people, to Agree to Terms of said relationship, such that all prior rooted securities are vulnerable to a new vector of "legal" literary attack? For example, consider "<a href="https://www.moxytongue.com/2021/03/vaccination-passports.html">Vaccination Passports</a>" as a choice that a person, or people make to have a verified relationship to a governed exchange of information credentials, and personal data context for the purpose of gaining access to services, or "Rights" in civil society.</p><p>Two choices exist when the concept of a vaccination passport enters the world;</p><p>1. Do "We", the people Governing civil society, require a person to gain access to our legally operating jurisdiction, its services, and its infrastructure of accountability in order to have "Human Rights", and access to our Sovereign territory, by utilizing a digital application that issues, holds, and verifies credentials documenting acceptance under Terms?</p><p>2. Do I, a rooted person, exist in a place that understands and demonstrates respect for Individual life, liberty, and pursuits of human happiness, and provides methods for people to express the meaning of a civil society designed "of, by, for" those people?</p><p>Civil Society in 2021 is very confused about the meaning of Constitutional literature; the Constitutional integrity of a Sovereign jurisdiction, once revered for its design "of, by, for" people, has been laid bare to reveal the autocratic nature of data management used to compel participation by the administrative methods Governing Terms of access.</p><p>People, having choices presented to them by "leaders" who can neither understand or audit the methods of their "leadership" at the hands of vaccination passports, functioning as high-tech data instruments providing access to core and leisure services in society, are at the mercy of non-functional incompetence. Market forces manipulating the intent of perceived methods of issuing, holding and verifying these ID-based data exchanges, are opaquely obscured from view behind the strategic lens of corporations known as "Think Tanks", who analyze, interpret, deploy, and lobby for the dissemination of their invested byproducts, using the dextrous sunlight of open source software as their "good faith" transparency claims.</p><p>Do you "trust" these supply chains? Will your "trust" be manufactured by technical entities designed to overcome your limitations by directly countering your incompetence? Will you "choose" to transact "trust" over the internet, or will you be branded as "trust" within the data exchanges processed by applications on the internet? Or will you leave the internet, and use the freedom-preserving technology of the blockchain to process your "choice" of participation?</p><p>When you drive around your local town that you call home, or walk in your fields behind your home, or the forests and open public spaces of "civil society" above which satellites orbit, do you control the "choice" of what pings that device in your pocket? Do you "choose" to use wifi, or the internet? Did you "choose" to attend public school? What "choice" did you have?</p><p>Non-participation; is this the last bastion of human freedom?&nbsp;</p><p>When DARPA was busy funding, researching and advancing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET">tcp/ip</a> as a communication network design, and the NSF was busy figuring out how to commercialize its deployment into civil society, using the tax dollars of people, each person who was responsible for paying those taxes via their working revenues of participation in Sovereign society, did you get a "choice" about how this technology was used to break the ultimate silo, the identification of your participation as a person, a human, with inherent Rights and structurally required protections?</p><p>When did the surveillance system, pinging every person's hand-held tech, scanning every person's face, watching every registered automobile travel, access the "choice" of participation that people, every person is now experiencing?</p><p>When did you make your choice?</p><p>The vaccination passport is that choice, made real today, in 2021. Civil Society has been hacking the relationship dependencies upon which it is based for many years, in a spirit of good faith, extended by a people with unalienable and self-evident Rights. Our efforts extended from this choice will determine whether "We" ever deserved to consider ourselves with self-respect.</p><p>Hitler was the leader of what history now knows as the nazis. There were millions of nazis that gave Hitler his power, each in small acts of cowardice, compliance and short-sighted "choices". Fear is a great motivator of people, and cults leverage it to induce mass "choices" that defy the inherent integrity of an actual human choice.</p><p>People, Individuals all, is only real when every person makes it so. The masses, or "We/They" as literature refers to it, never make choices, even if data science tells you that the aggregated meaning of data about people is the same thing. Methods matter, and leveraging the masses to damage the life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness by people, any person, is a longstanding experience on planet Earth, by many hands and methods.</p><p>Vaccination passports are the newest incarnation of a "choice" that reduces actual choice of, by, for people. You need to understand the difference, your life depends on it, and more importantly, every future human life does too. Civil Society is failing the relationships it is based upon, and everyone has their own "story" to tell about what that means.</p><p>I remain a rooted refugee, speaking, working, and defending the spirit of my civil society, a light set on a hill, to stand guard of, by, for the choices of myself, my people, and any person reaching for a helping human hand. Children don't choose; they are the litmus paper of our data-created reality. Any act done unto them having data consequence in time, that is not an adequate representation of their Sovereign design, is an enemy of their human design.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>

   <br> Here we go.. as 2020 got the dead history party started, 2021 is bringing all of history to life. The real lesson unlearned or ignored from history revolves around the nature of human participation in any/every society. When people look back at figures like Hitler, it is easy to give a quick diagnosis that includes "that man was evil". Well, he didn't get there alone. The masses of lil-nazi's he preyed upon served as the foundation of hate/fear that fueled his rise and ambitions. People who never thought of themselves as having strong nazi-cult proclivities gave rise to just that. <br>  In 2021, these same people, omitted from the telling of history's tales, immune from the meaning of their participation in how society functions, are bringing their fear to life in new and insidious ways. As the title of this post suggests, under the guise of "health" integrity, and protection of various Sovereign territories and legal jurisdictions, people all over the world are going to have an idea/method positioned for their use against the backdrop of the threat of death.  <br>  The idea of a vaccination passport is that participation in certain parts of society, like air travel, school, sporting events, outdoor music concerts, and really any social activity with a gateway managing access, like Disney World, is going to force compliance to the use of identity-based vaccination passports for access to such services. Will gas stations, grocery stores, interstate highways accessed via toll booths require the documented compliance of personal vaccination passports? Surely time will tell, and as this effort heats up at the hands of bureaucrats and employees advancing methods they are told to advance, where in the process do "Human Rights" reside?&nbsp;  <br>  Personal liberty is a highly managed process in an identity-based world. A vaccination passport allows perfect data capture and use of the personal identity of Individual people seeking to access once freely accessible parts of civil Society. But as 2020 has shown, this access is easily destroyed when deemed necessary by Governments and employed bureaucrats lacking any real functional accountability to their constituents. Data slaves will use vaccination passports because they are forced to, and fear suggests it is necessary to protect them.  <br>  The vaccination passport represents the introduction of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Credit_System">CCP social credit system</a> to America, transmuting people into sub-human data points lasting lifetimes. This fear-based governance methods work really well, at the expense of Individual liberty or any notion of a civil society derived "of, by, for people".&nbsp;  <br>  As you consider this issue, you should put some clear eyes on the companies, organizations, and Individuals leading this effort. These people deserve their own databased, identified mechanisms documenting their strong nazi-cult methods of supporting the administration of people as cattle, as fearful beings "trusting" their leaders with their compliance. It has begun in earnest.  <br>  Take a scan, more will be added in time.&nbsp;  <br>   <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ExqCl7mXAAA-dwK?format=jpg&amp;name=large"></a> <br> <br>  <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ExqCw18WQAESHfz?format=jpg&amp;name=large"></a> <br> <br>  <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ExqC0t9WQAQtGoM?format=jpg&amp;name=large"></a> <br> <br>  <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ExqC5dSXAAIAdGg?format=jpg&amp;name=large"></a> <br> <br>Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org/">https://www.goodhealthpass.org/</a>  <br>  _____________________________________________________________________  <br>  Update, April 1st, 2021.. from Project VRM Mailing List, in thread with Linux Foundation, Executive Director of <a href="https://www.covidcreds.org">COVID Credentials Initiative</a>&nbsp;and Drummond Reed, Trust Officer at Evernym:&nbsp;  <br>  I've read your posts, I've read about your efforts at LF, I'm familiar with Drummond's efforts, I understand the intent of choices made, and I understand where the leadership perspective in SSI resolves on this issue. <br>  <br>  <br>  Here, that answer is simple. "Here" is a community attempting to correct a power imbalance, to restore integrity of participation to Individuals, to aid in the relationship building process between suppliers and consumers, and perhaps to change the definition of market relationships, and computing relationships even (Master/Slave/User/etc). Beyond politics, this community exists to empower technical solutions, to bring attention to poor/dangerous methods and give developers help in finding the path to the future where people - "people", Individual persons, have authority over their choices of participation.  <br>  Anything that renders "choice" obsolete, is an enemy vector.  <br>  So your understanding of this moment is imbued with your politics, as is mine. You are concerned about a virus called COVID-19, I am more concerned with a virus called "We People". You want socialization under safe Terms, I want to be left alone, to choose where, when, how and why I participate on my own Terms.&nbsp;  <br>  So you choose to support an idea that has the effect you desire, and which I view as a means to reduce the effect I desire. Your evaluation of danger differs from mine, and thus your methods differ. You believe that a vaxport/health pass is a positive contribution to social safety, and I view it as a false narrative destined to reduce "trust" in society. This renders a new choice for all of us, as your efforts corrupt the space by intent, where each of us can pursue the outcome this community is here to solve.  <br>  What do you see as the catastrophic effect that the vaxport aids in diminishing?  <br>  If I see that same catastrophic effect being defined as "meat eaters", and enable a solution to track meat eaters as a risk vector spreading viral contamination in my society, do you agree to support my choice? How about the flu? What is the line where COVID-19 becomes different, if you do not believe those are worthy uses for a vaxport type solution/implementation?  <br>  "We" is an actionable virus of the mind, and history has many tales to tell of the actions induced by forced conformity, or socialization of "safety" ideas that a community/culture&nbsp;uses to enforce methods of control upon itself. While methods can be well researched, and intent on "doing it right", what about the 1st principle of making that "choice" that sets up the false "choice" for all others? Where does your personal power, in skill and authority, resolve in the end?  <br>  People in China believe that the social credit system is doing good things for them, reducing corruption, helping people "trust" one another. They willingly choose friends with positive social scores, and avoid those lacking such scores. Society becomes inflicted by this false "choice", except to the people, Institutionally inclined by their politics, positioned with uber-authority over others, and there is very little dissention. Why? The system destroys it, and compels its destruction by the "choices" of the people.  <br>  Brilliant really. "We" becomes the weakest link in the human experience, and Individual persons are subjugated to false choices for very precise reasons. It appears to be a dominant method of socialization and human control. It looks like a formidable foe to any idea of "people" as persons, Individuals all, with inherent Rights resolving to their own authority, accountable and free.  <br>  Where is the line? Where do your business interests intervene? Where do your unifying globalist thoughts about human safety become relevant to local context? How do your systems help my participation from within my system to compete with other systems that are directly squared off against mine in an aggressive coercion of fear for the benefit of the imaginary reality of "We"?  <br>  I mentor and help young developers. 10's of thousands of them over the past 25 years. There are some very important commonalities among developers that go into the ways in which they see problems, and produce results.  <br>  I find most adult developers/CS grads to be cowards in the real world; the basement has provided shelter for many generations of developers,and many organizations have built methods with the help of basement dwelling developers that miss the human mark on integrity.  <br>  Since my beginning days, I would say 25% of the young developers/CS grads I have worked with have been "on the spectrum"; I inherently understand what this means in personal ways, and see very clear evidence of the problems it produces for real world implementations of technology created for social consumption.  <br>  Vaxports are an idea that emanates&nbsp;from foundation of fear, and while not targeting&nbsp;old people, or slightly overweight white guys with blonde hair and blue eyes, like perhaps they should, they are targeting a false choice under the guise of safety. Not meat eaters, not wet market suppliers or consumers, not people who mix it up with exotic animal-human convergences or testings... nope, vaxports target basic safe participation in society by all people.  <br>  Already, their existence is promulgating an idea that their use can accomplish the mission-focused political quest to eliminate anti-vaxxers from society. Already, the left-cult of American politics is using them to shame people into compliance. Already, good people, with good intentions have been corrupted by a "choice" to support the lowest form of human thought, the lowest form of human participation in civil systems, market systems, educational systems, and the need to comply will carry far more weight than the evaluation of methods used.  <br>  The use of the word "trust" in marketing is something that carries its own meaning. If your methods are trust-worthy, you dont need to tell me to "trust" you. In fact, doing so creates the opposite effect. Co-opting words like self-Sovereignty to pursue market goals, reputation goals, ID adoption goals, and then pushing a choice inducing non-choice for others in pursuit of "SSI" goals is going to bite you in the ass.  <br>  Non-participation has always carried weight, always had value when needed. "No" was a choice Brian, Drummond. Your choice, now induces my lack of "choice", and thus becomes conflict-oriented. Restoring the integrity of participation to people, Individual persons, without participating in fear-based governance methods, is my only interest really. Destroying efforts that counter that becomes a focus. <br>  ----------------------  <br>   [Easter Update: If you are discussing this topic with people, help them derive some context. Consider some foundational logic that applies beyond the immediate context of a pandemic, as data won't expire, and thus these concepts live forever in an ID context, as they must.  <br>  Clearly, people need management to be "trusted", if this vaccination passport concept holds water. So lets go deeper to more foundational concepts of social safety; lets launch the "Vagina Passport" (VagPort) and its requisite companion, the "Penis Passport" (PeniPort).&nbsp;  <br>  "We" can no longer allow people to engage in untrusted, undocumented interactions, and clearly, based on global sex trafficking alone, let alone run-of-the-mill sexual abuse pervading communities, high schools, Universities and offices of Congress weekly, consent must be registered before any human sexual contact can be allowed. Our viral afflictions must be contained.  <br>  For the safety of every human on planet Earth, every daughter, every son, get your VagPort and PeniPort today! Don't delay, exposing your clear and obvious intent to rape others of their safety. Comply now, and tell the world you too can be "trusted" as a safety-first member of Society.  <br>  Of course, stupid is as stupid does.... END OF UPDATE]  <br><br>

<p>In 2018 I built a <a href="https://web.hypothes.is/blog/annotation-powered-questionnaires/">tool</a> to help researchers evaluate a proposed set of <a href="https://credweb.org/reviewed-signals-20200224/">credibility signals</a> intended to enable <a href="https://misinfocon.com/how-annotation-enables-machine-learning-fc4b0ceab10a">automated systems</a> to rate the credibility of news stories.</p>
<p>Here are examples of such signals:</p>
<p>– Authors cite expert sources (positive)</p>
<p>– Title is clickbaity (negative)</p>
<p>And my favorite:</p>
<p>– Authors acknowledge uncertainty (positive)</p>
<p>Will the news ecosystem ever be able to label stories automatically based on automatic detection of such signals, and if so, should it? These are open questions. The best way to improve news literacy may be the <a href="https://hapgood.us/2019/06/19/sift-the-four-moves/">SIFT</a> method advocated by Mike Caulfield, which shifts attention away from intrinsic properties of individual news stories and advises readers to:</p>
<p>– Stop</p>
<p>– Investigate the source</p>
<p>– Find better coverage</p>
<p>– Trace claims, quotes, and media to original context</p>
<p>“The goal of SIFT,” writes Charlie Warzel in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/18/opinion/fake-news-media-attention.html">Don’t Go Down the Rabbit Hole</a>, “isn’t to be the arbiter of truth but to instill a reflex that asks if something is worth one’s time and attention and to turn away if not.”</p>
<p>SIFT favors extrinsic signals over the intrinsic ones that were the focus of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/credibility/">W3C Credible Web Community Group</a>. But intrinsic signals may yet play an important role, if not as part of a large-scale automated labeling effort then at least as another kind of news literacy reflex.</p>
<p>This morning, in <a href="https://www.bozemandailychronicle.com/ap_news/commentary-how-public-health-officials-can-convince-those-reluctant-to-get-the-covid-19-vaccine/article_0d3d0540-8c55-5f55-9078-f6ca2052cf4e.html">How public health officials can convince those reluctant to get the COVID-19 vaccine</a>, I read the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>What made these Trump supporters shift their views on vaccines? Science — offered straight-up and with a dash of humility.</p>
<p>The unlikely change agent was Dr. Tom Frieden, who headed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during the Obama administration. Frieden appealed to facts, not his credentials. He noted that the theory behind the vaccine was backed by 20 years of research, that tens of thousands of people had participated in well-controlled clinical trials, and that the overwhelming share of doctors have opted for the shots.</p>
<p>He leavened those facts with an acknowledgment of uncertainty. He conceded that the vaccine’s potential long-term risks were unknown. He pointed out that the virus’s long-term effects were also uncertain.</p>
<p>“He’s just honest with us and telling us nothing is 100% here, people,” one participant noted.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here’s evidence that acknowledgement of uncertainty really is a powerful signal of credibility. Maybe machines will be able to detect it and label it; maybe those labels will matter to people. Meanwhile, it’s something people can detect and do care about. Teaching students to value sources that acknowledge uncertainty, and discount ones that don’t, ought to be part of any strategy to improve news literacy.</p>

<p>Several years ago I bought two 5-packs of reading glasses. There was a 1.75-diopter set for books, magazines, newspapers, and my laptop (when it’s in my lap), plus a 1.25-diopter set for the screens I look at when working in my <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2009/03/14/the-floating-arms-keyboard/">Captain Kirk chair</a>. They were cheap, and the idea was that they’d be an abundant resource. I could leave spectacles lying around in various places, there would always be a pair handy, no worries about losing them.</p>
<p>So of course I did lose them like crazy. At one point I bought another 5-pack but still, somehow, I’m down to a single 1.75 and a single 1.25. And I just realized it’s been that way for quite a while. Now that the resource is scarce, I value it more highly and take care to preserve it.</p>
<p>I’m sorely tempted to restock. It’s so easy! A couple of clicks and two more 5-packs will be here tomorrow. And they’re cheap, so what’s not to like?</p>
<p>For now, I’m resisting the temptation because I don’t like the effect such radical abundance has had on me. It’s ridiculous to lose 13 pairs of glasses in a couple of years. I can’t imagine how I’d explain that to my pre-Amazon self.</p>
<p>For now, I’m going to try to assign greater value to the glasses I do have, and treat them accordingly. And when I finally do lose them, I hope I’ll resist the one-click solution. I thought it was brilliant at the time, and part of me still does. But it just doesn’t feel good.</p>

<p>Note: This post is the sole opinion and perspective of the&nbsp;author.</p><p>Over the past several months I have been diligently attempting to map the dynamically evolving world of trust frameworks and verifiable credentials into a straightforward and hopefully timeless terminology that can be used for policymaking. The storyboard diagram above is what I’ve come up with so&nbsp;far.</p>  Counterparty — for every consequential relationship or transaction there are at a minimum of two parties involved. Regardless of whether the interaction is collaborative, competitive, zero positive sum, they can be considered as counterparties to one&nbsp;another.  Claim — is the something that is the matter of concern between the counterparties — it can be financial, tangible, intangible; something in the present, or a promise of something in the&nbsp;future.  Offer — a counterparty offers something that usually relates to a&nbsp;Claim.  Commit — a counterparty can commit to its&nbsp;Offer.  Present — a counterparty can present an Offer (or a&nbsp;Claim).  Accept — on the other side, the other counterparty accepts an&nbsp;Offer.  Issue — An Offer, once formed, can be issued in whatever form — usually a document or credential that is signed by the counterparty.  Hold — An offer can be held. How it is held depends on its embodiment (e.g.., digital, paper, verbal,&nbsp;etc.)  Verify — An offer, or more specifically its embodiment can be verified for its origin and integrity.  <p>All of the above is made possible&nbsp;by:</p>  Business Trust — how the counterparties decide to trust one another. This is the non-technical aspect of agreements, rules, treaties, legislation, etc.  <p>And underpinned by:</p>  Technical Trust: how the counterparties prove to another that their trust has not been compromised. This the technical aspect that includes, cryptographic protocols, data formats,&nbsp;etc.  <p>Why is this useful? When writing policy, you need a succinct model which is clear enough for subsequent interpretation. To do this, you need conceptual buckets to drop things into. Yes, this model is likely to change, but it’s my best and latest crack at it to synthesize the complex world of digital credentials with an abstraction that might be useful to help us align existing solutions while adopting exciting new capabilities.</p><p>As always, I am open for comment and constructive feedback. You know where to find&nbsp;me.</p>

<p>It’s no secret we need a better web. The original vision of an open and decentralized network that’s universally accessible continues to be a north star for those working to design the future of digital infrastructure for everyday people. Despite the progress that has been made in democratising access to massive amounts of information, the dire state of cybersecurity and privacy on the internet today present significant barriers to access for too many of our most vulnerable populations. We started MATTR because we believe that standards, transparency, and openness are not only better for users; they make for stronger systems and more resilient networks. We recognize that a decentralized web of digital trust, based on transparency, consent, and verifiable data, can help us address critical challenges on a global scale. It represents a significant opportunity to give people real agency and control over their digital&nbsp;lives.</p> Our story <p>At its inception, we chose “MATTR” as a moniker because we strongly believed that the movement towards more decentralized systems will fundamentally change the nature of data and privacy on the internet. Matter, in its varying states, forms the building blocks of the universe, symbolically representing the capacity for change and transformation that allows us all to grow and adapt. In another sense, people matter, and the impact of decisions we make as builders of technology extend beyond ourselves. It’s a responsibility we take seriously, as Tim Berners Lee puts it, “to preserve new frontiers for the common good.” We proudly bear the name MATTR and the potential it represents as we’ve built out our little universe of products.</p><p>In September 2020, we <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/introducing-the-mattr-platform-91db4925c773">introduced</a> our decentralized identity platform. Our goal was to deliver standards-based digital trust to developers in a scalable manner. We designed our platform with a modular security architecture to enable our tools to work across many different contexts. By investing deeply in open standards and open source communities as well as developing insights through collaboration and research, we realized that developers want to use something that’s convenient without compromising on flexibility, choice, or security. That’s why we launched our platform with standards-based cryptography and configurable building blocks to suit a broad array of use cases and user experiences in a way that can evolve as technology matures.</p><p>At the same time, we’ve continued to work in open source and open standards communities with greater commitment than ever to make sure we’re helping to build a digital ecosystem that can support global scale. We launched <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/">MATTR Learn</a> and <a href="https://mattr.global/resources/">MATTR Resources</a> as hubs for those interested in these new technologies, developing educational content to explore concepts around decentralized identity, offering guided developer tutorials and videos, and providing documentation and API references. We also unveiled a <a href="https://mattr.global/">new website</a>, introduced a novel approach to <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/a-solution-for-privacy-preserving-verifiable-credentials-f1650aa16093">selective disclosure of verifiable credentials</a>, built and defined a <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/jwm-a-new-standard-for-secure-messaging-a21d3daa4403">new secure messaging standard</a>, developed a prototype for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXvWxFjHvdY">paper-based credentials</a> to cater for low-tech environments, and made a bridge to <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/introducing-oidc-credential-provider-7845391a9881">extend OpenID Connect with verifiable credentials</a>. We’ve consistently released tools and added features to make our products more secure, extensible, and easy to use. In parallel, we also <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/news/2020/10/09/news-release-dhs-st-svip-makes-new-phase-1-awards-five-blockchain-companies">joined the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s SVIP program</a> in October to help advance the goals of decentralized identity and demonstrate provable interoperability with other vendors in a transparent and globally-visible manner. Zooming out a bit, our journey at MATTR is part of a much larger picture of passionate people working in collaborative networks across the world to make this&nbsp;happen.</p> The bigger&nbsp;picture <p>It has been an incredible year for decentralized and self-sovereign identity as a whole. In light of the global-scale disruption of COVID-19, the demand for more secure digital systems became even more critical to our everyday lives. Start-ups, corporations, governments, and standards organizations alike have been heavily investing in building technology and infrastructure to support an increasingly digital world. We’re seeing this innovation happen across the globe, from the work being done by the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/svip">DHS Silicon Valley Innovation Program</a> to the <a href="https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/">Pan-Canadian Trust Framework</a> and <a href="https://www.digital.govt.nz/news/development-of-digital-identity-trust-framework-confirmed/">New Zealand Digital Identity Trust Framework</a>. Many global leaders are stepping up to support and invest in more privacy-preserving digital security, and for good reason. Recent legislation like <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a> and <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">CCPA</a> have made the role of big tech companies and user data rights increasingly important, providing a clear mandate for a wave of change that promises to strengthen the internet for the public good. This provides an incredible catalyst for all the work happening in areas such as cryptography, decentralized computing and digital governance. Just in the last year, we’ve seen the following advancements:</p>  <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/secure-data-storage.html">Secure Data Storage WG</a> created at <a href="https://identity.foundation/">DIF</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a> to realize an interoperable technology for encrypted and confidential data&nbsp;storage  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers</a> v1.0 specification reached “Candidate Recommendation” stage at the W3C, establishing stability in anticipation of standardization later this&nbsp;year  <a href="https://identity.foundation/sidetree/spec/">Sidetree protocol</a> v1.0 released at DIF, providing a layer-2 blockchain solution for scalable Decentralized Identifiers built on top of ledgers such as Bitcoin and&nbsp;Ethereum  <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging v2.0</a> specification launched at DIF, a new protocol for secure messaging based on Decentralized Identifiers and built on JOSE encryption standards  <a href="https://identity.foundation/did-siop/">Self-Issued OpenID</a> (SIOP) became an official working group item at the <a href="https://openid.net/foundation/">OpenID Foundation</a>, advancing the conversation around the role of identity providers on the&nbsp;web  Google’s <a href="https://github.com/WICG/WebID">WebID project</a> started developing features to allow the browser to mediate interactions between end-users and identity providers in a privacy-preserving way  <p>For more information on how all of these technologies are interconnected, read our latest paper, <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/the-state-of-identity-on-the-web-cffc392bc7ea">The State of Identity on the&nbsp;Web</a>.</p><p>In addition, as part of our involvement with the DHS SVIP program, in March of this year we participated in the DHS SVIP Interoperability Plugfest. This event saw 8 different companies, representing both human-centric identity credentials as well as asset-centric supply chain traceability credentials, come together to showcase standards-compliance and genuine cross-vendor and cross-platform interoperability via testing and live demonstrations. The full presentation, including demos and videos from the public showcase day, can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MeeP7vDXb9CpSBfjTybYbo8qJfrrbrXCSJa0DklNe2k/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p><p>These are just a handful of the significant accomplishments achieved over the last year. It’s been incredibly inspiring to see so many people working towards a common set of goals for the betterment of the web. As we’ve built our products and developed alongside the broader market, we’ve learned quite a bit about how to solve some of the core business and technical challenges associated with this new digital infrastructure. We’ve also gained a lot of insight from working directly with governments and companies across the globe to demonstrate interoperability and build bridges across different technology ecosystems.</p> Launching MATTR&nbsp;VII <p>We’ve been hard at work making our decentralized identity platform better than ever, and we’re proud to announce that as of today, we’re ready to support solutions that solve real-world problems for your users, in production — and it’s open to everybody.</p><p>That’s why we’re rebranding our platform to MATTR VII. Inspired by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_matter">seven states of matter</a>, our platform gives builders and developers all the tools they need at their fingertips to create a whole new universe of decentralized products and applications. We provide all the raw technical building blocks to allow you to create exactly what you have in mind. MATTR VII is composable and configurable to fit your needs, whether you’re a well-established business with legacy systems or a start-up looking to build the next best thing in digital privacy.

This video shows an example of multiple steel supply chain actors exchanging verifiable trade information culminating in a seamless review process from&nbsp;CBP.</p> Interoperability across industries <p>We also worked with other cohort companies to demonstrate how important credentials like a vaccination certificate can be used to help supply chain professionals get back to work safely. This demo includes the use of selective disclosure technology as well as off-line verification of a paper credential.</p> Charting the&nbsp;Course <p>Interoperability across systems moves the internet towards a more open-network approach for trustworthy exchange of information.

  How “Assume positive intent” downplays impact, gaslights employees, and absolves leaders of responsibility.

<p>Lets talk about that well-worn bit of wisdom: “assume positive intent.” On the
surface it’s excellent advice: practice empathy by mindfully assuming that
people may create issues despite their best intentions. You’ve heard the
parables, from Steven Covey’s <a href="http://people.tamu.edu/~v-buenger/658/Steven_Covey.html" title="Steven Covey: Paradigms and the 7 Habits">paradigm shift on the subway</a> to
David Foster Wallace’s <a href="https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~drkelly/DFWKenyonAddress2005.pdf" title="Transcription of the 2005 Kenyon Commencement Address - May 21, 2005 — Written and Delivered by David Foster Wallace">latent condemnation</a> of gas-guzzling traffic
and soul-sucking supermarkets. Pepsi CEO Indra Nooyi has <a href="https://archive.fortune.com/galleries/2008/fortune/0804/gallery.bestadvice.fortune/7.html" title="The best advice I ever got — Indra Nooyi">popularized the
notion</a> to ubiquity in corporate America.</p>
<p>In practice, the assumption of positive intent enables some pretty serious
anti-patterns.</p>
<p>First, focusing on intent downplays impact. Good intentions don’t change the
outcomes of one’s actions: we still must deal with whatever broke. At best, good
intentions enable openness to feedback and growth, but do not erase those
mistakes.</p>
<p>Which leads us to a more fundamental dilemma. In a <a href="https://forge.medium.com/the-problem-with-assuming-positive-intent-ea8385ce961d" title="The Problem With Assuming Positive Intent">piece for Medium</a> last year,
<a href="https://medium.com/@ruth_terry/about">Ruth Terry</a>, quoting the <a href="http://kirwaninstitute.osu.edu/" title="Kirwan Institute for the Study of Race and Ethnicity">Kirwan Institute</a>’s Lena Tenney, summarizes it aptly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By downplaying actual impact, assuming positive intent can deprioritize the
experience of already marginalized people.</p>
<p>“All of this focus on intention essentially remarginalizes a person of color
who’s speaking up about racism by telling them that their experience doesn’t
matter because the person didn’t mean it that way,” says Tenney, who helped
create interactive implicit bias learning tools for the Kirwan Institute.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This remarginalization of the vulnerable seriously undermines the convictions
behind “assume positive intent,” not to mention the culture at large. But the
impact transcends racial contexts: it appears wherever people present
uncomfortable issues to people in a dominant position.</p>
<p>Take the workplace. A brave employee publicly calls out a problematic behavior
or practice, often highlighting implicit bias or, at the very least, patterns
that contradict the professed values of the organization. Management nods and
says, “I’m glad you brought that up, but it’s important for us all to assume
positive intent in our interactions with our co-workers.” Then they explain the
context for the actions, or, more likely, list potential mitigating details —
without the diligence of investigation or even consequences. Assume positive
intent, guess at or manufacture explanations, but little more.</p>
<p>This response minimizes the report’s impact to management while simultaneously
de-emphasizing the experience of the worker who voiced it. Such brave folks,
speaking just a little truth to power, may start to doubt themselves or what
they’ve seen. The manager has successfully <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting" title="Wikpedia: “Gaslighting”">gaslighted</a> the worker.</p>
<p>Leaders: please don’t do this. The phrase is not “Assume positive intent for me,
but not for thee.” Extend the assumption only to the people reporting
uncomfortable issues. There’s a damn good chance they came to you only by the
assumption of positive intent: if your coworkers thought you had ill-intent,
they would not speak at all.</p>
<p>If you feel inclined to defend behavior or patterns based on presumption of
good intent, avoid that reflex, too. Good intent may be key to transgressors
accepting difficult feedback, but hold them accountable and don’t let
assumptions stand on their own. Impact matters, and so must consequences.</p>
<p>Most importantly, Never use the assumption of good intent to downplay or
dismiss the crucial but uncomfortable or inconvenient feedback brave souls bring
to you.</p>
<p>Assume positive intent in yourself, never assert it in others, and know that,
regardless of intent, problems still must be addressed without making excuses or
devaluing or dismissing the people who have suffered them.</p>

<p>After the OAuth 2.0 JWT Secured Authorization Request (JAR) specification <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=2121">was sent to the RFC Editor</a>, the IESG requested an additional round of IETF feedback.  We’ve published an updated draft addressing the remaining review comments, specifically, SecDir comments from Watson Ladd.  The only normative change made since the 28 was to change the MIME Type from “<code>oauth.authz.req+jwt</code>” to “<code>oauth-authz-req+jwt</code>”, per advice from the designated experts.</p>
<p>As a reminder, this specification takes the JWT Request Object from <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#JWTRequests">Section 6 of OpenID Connect Core (Passing Request Parameters as JWTs)</a> and makes this functionality available for pure OAuth 2.0 applications – and does so without introducing breaking changes.  This is one of a series of specifications bringing functionality originally developed for OpenID Connect to the OAuth 2.0 ecosystem.  Other such specifications included OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7591">RFC 7591</a>] and OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8414">RFC 8414</a>].</p>
<p>The specification is available at:</p>

<p>The evolution of identity on the web is happening at a rapid pace, with many different projects and efforts converging around similar ideas with their own interpretations and constraints. It can be difficult to parse through all of these developments while the dust hasn’t completely settled, but looking at these issues holistically, we can see a much bigger pattern emerging. In fact, many of the modern innovations related to identity on the web are actually quite connected and build upon each other in a myriad of complementary ways.</p><p>The rise of OpenID&nbsp;Connect</p><p>The core of modern identity is undoubtedly <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a> (OIDC), the de-facto standard for user authentication and identity protocol on the internet. It’s a protocol that enables developers building apps and services to verify the identity of their users and obtain basic profile information about them in order to create an authenticated user experience. Because OIDC is an identity layer built on top of the OAuth 2.0 framework, it can also be used as an authorization solution. Its development was significant for many reasons, in part because it came with the realization that identity on the web is fundamental to many different kinds of interactions, and these interactions need simple and powerful security features that are ubiquitous and accessible. Secure digital identity is a problem that doesn’t make sense to solve over and over again in different ways with each new application, but instead needs a standard and efficient mechanism that’s easy to use and works for the majority of&nbsp;people.</p><p>OpenID Connect introduced a convenient and accessible protocol for identity that required less setup and complexity for developers building different kinds of applications and programs. In many ways, protocols like OIDC and <a href="https://oauth.net/2/">OAuth 2.0</a> piggy-backed on the revolution that was underfoot in the mid 2000’s as developers fled en-mass from web based systems heavily reliant on technologies like XML (and consequently identity systems built upon these technologies like SAML), for simpler systems based on JSON. OpenID built on the success of OAuth and offered a solution that improved upon existing identity and web security technologies which were vulnerable to attacks like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping">screen scraping</a>. This shift towards a solution built upon modern web technologies with an emphasis on being easy-to-use created ripe conditions for adoption of these web standards.</p><p>OIDC’s success has categorically sped up both the web and native application development cycle when it comes to requiring the integration of identity, and as a result, users have now grown accustomed to having sign-in options aplenty with all their favorite products and services. It’s not intuitively clear to your average user why they need so many different logins and it’s up to the user to manage which identities they use with which services, but the system works and provides a relatively reliable way to integrate identity on the&nbsp;web.</p><p>Success and its unintended consequences</p><p>While OIDC succeeded in simplicity and adoption, what has emerged over time are a number of limitations and challenges that have come as a result of taking these systems to a global&nbsp;scale.</p><p>When it comes to the market for consumer identity, there are generally three main actors&nbsp;present:</p>  Identity Providers  Relying Parties  End-Users  <p>The forces in the market that cause their intersection to exist are complex, but can be loosely broken down into the interaction between each pair of&nbsp;actors.</p><p>In order for an End-User to be able to “login” to a website today, the “sweet spot” must exist where each of these sets of requirements are&nbsp;met.</p><p>The negotiation between these three parties usually plays out on the relying party’s login page. It’s this precious real-estate that drives these very distinct market&nbsp;forces.</p><p>Anti-competitive market&nbsp;forces</p><p>In typical deployments of OIDC, in order for a user to be able to “login” to a relying party or service they’re trying to access online, the relying party must be in direct contact with the Identity Provider (IdP). This is what’s come to be known as the <a href="https://github.com/WICG/WebID#the-idp-tracking-problem">IdP tracking problem</a>. It’s the IdP that’s responsible for performing end-user authentication and issuing end-user identities to relying parties, not the end-users themselves. Over time, these natural forces in OIDC have created an environment that tends to favour the emergence and continued growth of a small number of very large IdPs. These IdPs wield a great deal of power, as they have become a critical dependency and intermediary for many kinds of digital interactions that require identity.</p><p>This environment prevents competition and diversity amongst IdPs in exchange for a convenience-driven technology framework where user data is controlled and managed in a few central locations. The market conditions have made it incredibly difficult for new IdPs to break into the market. For example, when Apple unveiled their “Sign in with Apple” service, they used their position as a proprietary service provider to mandate their inclusion as a third party sign in option for any app or service that was supporting federated login on Apple devices. This effectively guaranteed adoption of their OpenID-based solution, allowing them to easily capture a portion of the precious real-estate that is the login screen of thousands of modern web apps today. This method of capturing the market is indicative of a larger challenge wherein the environment of OIDC has made it difficult for newer and smaller players in the IdP ecosystem to participate with existing vendors on an equal playing&nbsp;field.</p><p>Identity as a secondary concern has primary consequences</p><p>Another key issue in the current landscape is that for nearly all modern IdPs, being an identity provider is often a secondary function to their primary line of business. Though they have come to wear many different hats, many of the key IdPs’ primary business function is offering some service to end-users (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Google, etc.). Their role as IdPs is something that emerged over time, and with it has surfaced a whole new set of responsibilities whose impact we are only just beginning to grapple&nbsp;with.</p><p>Due to this unequal relationship, developers and businesses who want to integrate identity in their applications are forced to choose those IdPs which contain user data for their target demographics, instead of offering options for IdP selection based on real metrics around responsible and privacy-preserving identity practices for end-users.</p><p>This cycle perpetuates the dominance of a few major IdPs and likewise forces users to keep choosing from the same set of options or risk losing access to all of their online accounts. In addition, many of these IdPs have leveraged their role as central intermediaries to increase surveillance and user behavior tracking, not just across their proprietary services, but across a user’s entire web experience. The net result of this architecture on modern systems is that IdPs have become a locus for centralized data storage and processing.</p><p>The privacy implications associated with the reliance on a central intermediary who can delete, control, or expose user data at any time have proven to be no small matter. New regulations such as <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a> and <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">CCPA</a> have brought user privacy to the forefront and have spurred lots of public discourse and pressure for companies to manage their data processing policies against more robust standards. The regulatory and business environment that is forming around GDPR and CCPA is pushing the market to consider better solutions that may involve decentralizing the mode of operation or separating the responsibilities of an&nbsp;IdP.</p><p>Identity Provider&nbsp;lock-in</p><p>Lastly, in today’s landscape there is an inseparable coupling between an End-User and the IdP they use. This effectively means that, in order to transfer from say “Sign In With Google” to “Sign In With Twitter,” a user often has to start over and build their identity from scratch. This is due to the fact that users are effectively borrowing or renting their identities from their IdPs, and hence have little to no control in exercising that identity how they see fit. This model creates a pattern that unnecessarily ties a user to the application and data ecosystem of their IdP and means they must keep an active account with the provider to keep using their identity. If a user can’t access to their account with an IdP, say by losing access to their Twitter profile, they can no longer login to any of the services where they’re using Twitter as their&nbsp;IdP.</p><p>One of the problems with the term Identity Provider itself is that it sets up the assumption that the end-user is being provided with an identity, rather than the identity being theirs or under their control. If end-users have no real choice in selecting their IdP, then they are ultimately subject to the whims of a few very large and powerful companies. This model is not only antithetical to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/06/technology/congress-big-tech-monopoly-power.html">anti-trust</a> policies and legislation, it also prevents data portability between platforms. It’s made it abundantly clear that the paradigm shift on end-user privacy practices needs to start by giving users a baseline level of choice when it comes to their identity.</p><p>A nod to an alternative model</p><p>Fundamentally, when it comes to identity on the web, users should have choice; choice about which services they employ to facilitate the usage of their digital identities along with being empowered to change these service providers if they so&nbsp;choose.</p><p>The irony of OpenID Connect is that the original authors did actually consider these problems, and evidence of this can be found in the original OIDC specification: in chapter 7, entitled “<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#SelfIssued">Self Issued OpenID Provider</a>” (SIOP).</p><p>Earning its name primarily from the powerful idea that users could somehow be their own identity provider, SIOP was an ambitious attempt at solving a number of different problems at once. It raises some major questions about the future of the protocol, but it stops short of offering an end-to-end solution to these complex problems.</p><p>As it stands in the core specification, the SIOP chapter of OIDC was really trying to solve 3 significant, but distinct problems, which&nbsp;are:</p>  Enabling portable/transferable identities between providers  Dealing with different deployment models for OpenID providers  Solving the <a href="https://indieweb.org/NASCAR_problem">Nascar&nbsp;Problem</a>  <p>SIOP has recently been of strong interest to those in the decentralized or self-sovereign identity community because it’s been identified as a <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/if-you-build-an-island-youll-need-a-boat-537f48525edc">potential pathway</a> to transitioning existing deployed digital infrastructure towards a more decentralized and user-centric model. As discussion is ongoing at the <a href="https://openid.net/foundation/">OpenID Foundation</a> to evolve and reboot the work around SIOP, there are a number of interesting questions raised by this chapter that are worth exploring to their full extent. For starters, SIOP questions some of the fundamental assumptions around the behaviour and deployment of an&nbsp;IdP.</p><p>OpenID and OAuth typically use a redirect mechanism to relay a request from a relying party to an IdP. OAuth supports redirecting back to a native app for the end-user, but it assumes that the provider itself always takes the form of an HTTP server, and furthermore it assumes the request is primarily handled server-side. SIOP challenged this assumption by questioning whether the identity provider has to be entirely server-side, or if the provider could instead take the form of a Single-Page Application (SPA), Progressive Web Application (PWA), or even a native application. In creating a precedent for improving upon the IdP model, SIOP was asking fundamental questions such as: who gets to pick the provider? What role does the end-user play in this selection process? Does the provider always need to be an authorization server or is there a more decentralized model available that is resilient from certain modes of compromise?</p><p>Although some of these questions remain unanswered or are early in development, the precedent set by SIOP has spurred a number of related developments in and around web identity. Work is ongoing at the OpenID Foundation to flesh out the implications of SIOP in the emerging landscape.</p><p>Tech giants capitalize on the conversation</p><p>Although OIDC is primarily a web-based identity protocol, it was purposefully designed to be independent of any particular browser feature or API. This separation of concerns has proved incredibly useful in enabling adoption of OIDC outside of web-only environments, but it has greatly limited the ability for browser vendors to facilitate and mediate web-based login events. A number of large technology and browser vendors have picked up on this discrepancy, and are starting to take ownership of the role they play in web-based user interactions.</p><p>Notably, a number of new initiatives have been introduced in the last few years to address this gap in user privacy on the web. An example of this can be found in the <a href="https://tag.w3.org/">W3C Technical Architecture Group</a> (TAG), a group tasked with documenting and building consensus around the architecture of the World Wide Web. Ahead of the 2019 <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/09/TPAC/">W3C TPAC</a> in Japan, Apple proposed an initiative called <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webappsec/2019Sep/0004.html">IsLoggedIn</a>, effectively a way for websites to tell the browser whether the user was logged in or not in a trustworthy way. What they realized is that the behavior of modern web architecture results in users being “logged in by default” to websites they visit, even if they only visit a website once. Essentially as soon as the browser loads a webpage, that page can store data about the user indefinitely on the device, with no clear mechanism for indicating when a user has logged out or wishes to stop sharing their data. They introduced an API that would allow browsers to set the status of user log-ins to limit long term storage of user data. It was a vision that required broad consensus among today’s major web browsers to be successful. Ultimately, the browsers have taken their own approach in trying to mitigate the&nbsp;issue.</p><p>In 2019, Google created their <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/chrome/building-a-more-private-web/">Privacy Sandbox</a> initiative to advance user privacy on the web using open and transparent standards. As one of the largest web browsers on the planet, Google Chrome seized the opportunity provided by an increased public focus on user privacy to work on limiting cross-site user tracking and pervasive incentives that encourage surveillance. Fuelled by the Privacy Sandbox initiative, they created a project called <a href="https://wicg.github.io/WebID/README.html">WebID</a> to explore how the browser can mediate between different parties in a digital identity transaction. WebID is an early attempt to get in the middle of the interaction that happens between a relying party and an IdP, allowing the browser to facilitate the transaction in a way that provides stronger privacy guarantees for the end-user.</p><p>As an overarching effort, it’s in many ways a response to the environment created by CCPA and GDPR where technology vendors like Google are attempting to enforce privacy expectations for end-users while surfing the web. Its goal is to keep protocols like OIDC largely intact while using the browser as a mediator to provide a stronger set of guarantees when it comes to user identities. This may ultimately give end-users more privacy on the web, but it doesn’t exactly solve the problem of users being locked into their IdPs. With the persistent problem of data portability and limited user choices, simply allowing the browser to mediate the interaction is an important piece of the puzzle but does not go far enough on its&nbsp;own.</p><p>Going beyond the current state of OpenID&nbsp;Connect</p><p>Though it is a critical component of modern web identity, OIDC is not by any means the only solution or protocol to attempt to solve these kinds of problems.</p><p>A set of emerging standards from the W3C Credentials Community Group aim to look at identity on the web in a very different way, and, in fact, are designed to consider use cases outside of just consumer identity. One such standard is <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers</a> (DIDs) which defines a new type of identifier and accompanying data model featuring several novel properties not present in most mainstream identifier schemes in use today. Using DIDs in tandem with technologies like <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> (VCs) creates an infrastructure for a more distributed and decentralized layer for identity on the web, enabling a greater level of user control. VCs were created as the newest in a long line of cryptographically secured data representation formats. Their goal was to provide a standard that improves on its predecessors by accommodating formal data semantics through technologies like JSON-LD and addressing the role of data subjects in managing and controlling data about themselves.</p><p>These standards have emerged in large part to address the limitations of federated identity systems such as the one provided by OIDC. In the case of DIDs, the focus has been on creating a more resilient kind of user-controllable identifier. These kinds of identifiers don’t have to be borrowed or rented from an IdP as is the case today, but can instead be directly controlled by the entities they represent via cryptography in a consistent and standard way. When combining these two technologies, VCs and DIDs, we enable verifiable information that has a cryptographic binding to the end-user and can be transferred cross-context while retaining its security and semantics.</p><p>As is the case with many emerging technologies, in order to be successful in an existing and complicated market, these new standards should have a cohesive relationship to the present. To that end, there has been a significant push to bridge these emerging technologies with the existing world of OIDC in a way that doesn’t break existing implementations and encourages interoperability.</p><p>One prominent example of this is a new extension to OIDC known as <a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/oidc-client-bound-assertions-spec/">OpenID Connect Credential Provider</a>. Current OIDC flows result in the user receiving an identity token which is coupled to the IdP that created it, and can be used to prove the user’s identity within a specific domain. OIDC Credential Provider allows you to extend OIDC to allow IdPs to issue reusable VCs about the end-user instead of simple identity tokens with limited functionality. It allows end-users to request credentials from an OpenID Provider and manage their own credentials in a <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/concepts/digital-wallets">digital wallet</a> under their control. By allowing data authorities to be the provider of reusable digital credentials instead of simple identity assertions, this extension effectively turns traditional Identity Providers into Credential Providers.</p><p>The credentials provided under this system are cryptographically bound to a public key controlled by the end-user. In addition to public key binding, the credential can instead be bound to a DID, adding a layer of indirection between a user’s identity and the keys they use to control it. In binding to a DID, the subject of the credential is able to maintain ownership of the credential on a longer life cycle due to their ability to manage and rotate keys while maintaining a consistent identifier. This eases the burden on data authorities to re-issue credentials when the subject’s keys change and allows relying parties to verify that the credential is always being validated against the current public key of the end-user. The innovations upon OIDC mark a shift from a model where relying parties request claims from an IdP, to one where they can request claims from specific issuers or according to certain <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/concepts/trust-frameworks">trust frameworks</a> and evaluation metrics appropriate to their use case. This kind of policy-level data management creates a much more predictable and secure way for businesses and people to get the data they&nbsp;need.</p><p>OIDC Credential Provider, a new spec at the OpenID Foundation, is challenging the notion that the identity that a user receives has to be an identity entirely bound to its domain. It offers traditional IdPs a way to issue credentials that are portable and can cross domains because the identity/identifier is no longer coupled to the provider as is the case with an identity token. <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/introducing-oidc-credential-provider-7845391a9881">This work</a> serves to further bridge the gap between existing digital identity infrastructure and emerging technologies which are more decentralized and user-centric. It sets the foundation for a deeper shift in how data is managed online, whether it comes in the form of identity claims, authorizations, or other kinds of <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/concepts/verifiable-data">verifiable data</a>.</p><p>Broadening the landscape of digital&nbsp;identity</p><p>OIDC, which is primarily used for identity, is built upon OAuth 2.0, whose primary use is authorization and access. If OIDC is about who the End-User is, then OAuth 2.0 is about what you’re allowed to do on behalf of and at the consent of the End-User. OAuth 2.0 was built prior to OIDC, in many ways because authorization allowed people to accomplish quite a bit without the capabilities of a formalized and standardized identity protocol. Eventually, it became obvious that identity is an integral and relatively well-defined cornerstone of web access that needed a simple solution. OIDC emerged as it increasingly became a requirement to know who the end-user (or resource owner) is and for the client to be able to request access to basic claims about them. Together, OIDC and OAuth2.0 create a protocol that combines authentication and authorization. While this allows them to work natively with one another, it’s not always helpful from an infrastructure standpoint to collapse these different functions together.</p><p>Efforts like WebID are currently trending towards the reseparation of these concepts that have become married in the current world of OpenID, by developing browser APIs that are specifically geared towards identity. However, without a solution to authorization, it could be argued that many of the goals of the project will remain unsatisfied whenever the relying party requires both authentication and authorization in a given interaction.</p><p>As it turns out, these problems are all closely related to each other and require a broad and coordinated approach. As we step into an increasingly digital era where the expectation continues to evolve around what’s possible to do online, the role of identity becomes increasingly complex. Take, for example, sectors such as the financial industry dealing with increased requirements around electronic Know-Your-Customer (KYC) policies. In parallel with the innovation around web identity and the adoption of emerging technologies such as VCs, there has been a growing realization that the evolution of digital identity enables many opportunities that extend far beyond the domain of identity. This is where the power of verifiable data on the web really begins, and with it an expanded scope and structure for how to build digital infrastructure that can support a whole new class of applications.</p><p>A new proposed browser API called <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/credential-handler-api/">Credential Handler API</a> (CHAPI) offers a promising solution to browser-mediated interactions that complements the identity-centric technologies of OIDC and WebID. It currently takes the form of a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Polyfill">polyfill</a> to allow these capabilities to be used in the browser today. Similar to how SIOP proposes for the user to be able pick their provider for identity-related credentials, CHAPI allows you to pick your provider, but not just for identity — for any kind of credential. In that sense, OIDC and CHAPI are solving slightly different problems:</p>  OIDC is primarily about requesting authentication of an End-User and receiving some limited identity claims about them, and in certain circumstances also accessing protected resources on their&nbsp;behalf.  CHAPI is about requesting credentials that may describe the End-user or may not. Additionally, credentials might not even be related to their identity directly and instead used for other related functions like granting authorization, access,&nbsp;etc.  <p>While OIDC offers a simple protocol based upon URL redirects, CHAPI pushes for a world of deeper integration with the browser that affords several useability benefits. Unlike traditional implementations of OIDC, CHAPI does not start with the assumption that an identity is fixed to the provider. Instead, the end-user gets to register their preferred providers in the browser and then select from this list when an interaction with their provider is required. Since CHAPI allows for exchanging credentials that may or may not be related to the end-user, it allows for a much broader set of interactions than what’s provided by today’s identity protocols. In theory, these can work together rather than as alternative options. You could, for instance, treat CHAPI browser APIs as a client to contact the end-user’s OpenID Provider and then use CHAPI to exchange and present additional credentials that may be under the end-user’s control.</p><p>CHAPI is very oriented towards the “credential” abstraction, which is essentially a fixed set of claims protected in a cryptographic envelope and often intended to be long lived. A useful insight from the development of OIDC is that it may be helpful to separate, at least logically, the presentation of identity-related information from the presentation of other kinds of information. To extend this idea, authenticating or presenting a credential is different from authenticating that you’re the subject of a credential. You may choose to do these things in succession, but they are not inherently related.</p><p>The reason this is important has to do with privacy, data hygiene, and best security practices. In order to allow users to both exercise their identity on the web and manage all of their credentials in one place, we should be creating systems that default to requesting specific information about an end-user as needed, not necessarily requesting credentials when what’s needed is an authentic identity and vice&nbsp;versa.</p><p>Adopting this kind of policy would allow configurations where the identifier for the credential subject would not be assumed to be the identifier used to identify the subject with the relying party. Using this capability in combination with approaches to <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/concepts/selective-disclosure">selective disclosure</a> like <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/a-solution-for-privacy-preserving-verifiable-credentials-f1650aa16093">VCs with JSON-LD BBS+ signatures</a> will ensure not only a coherent system that can separate identity and access, but also one that respects user privacy and provides a bridge between existing identity management infrastructure and emerging technologies.</p><p>An emergent user experience</p><p>Using these technologies in tandem also helps to bridge the divide between native and web applications when it comes to managing identity across different modalities. Although the two often get conflated, a digital wallet for holding user credentials is not necessarily an application. It’s a service to help users manage their credentials, both identity-related and otherwise, and should be accessible wherever an end-user needs to access it. In truth, native apps and web apps are each good at different things and come with their own unique set of trade-offs and implementation challenges. Looking at this emerging paradigm where identity is managed in a coherent way across different types of digital infrastructure, “web wallets” and “native wallets” are not necessarily mutually exclusive — emerging technologies can leverage redirects to allow the use of&nbsp;both.</p><p>The revolution around digital identity offers a new paradigm that places users in a position of greater control around their digital interactions, giving them the tools to exercise agency over their identity and their data online. Modern legislation focused on privacy, portability, security and accessible user experience is also creating an impetus for the consolidation of legacy practices. The opportunity is to leverage this directional shift to create a network effect across the digital ecosystem, making it easier for relying parties to build secure web experiences and unlocking entirely new value opportunities for claims providers and data authorities.</p><p>Users shouldn’t have to manage the complexity left behind by today’s outdated identity systems, and they shouldn’t be collateral damage when it comes to designing convenient apps and services. Without careful coordination, much of the newer innovation could lead to even more fragmentation in the digital landscape. However, as we can see here, many of these technology efforts and standards are solving similar or complementary problems.</p><p>Ultimately, a successful reinvention of identity on the web should make privacy and security easy; easy for end-users to understand, easy for relying parties to support, and easy for providers to implement. That means building bridges across technologies to support not only today’s internet users, but enabling access to an entirely new set of stakeholders across the globe who will finally have a seat at the table, such as those without access to the internet or readily available web infrastructure. As these technologies develop, we should continue to push for consolidation and simplicity to strike the elusive balance between security and convenience across the ecosystem for everyday&nbsp;users.</p><p>Where to from&nbsp;here?</p><p>Solving the challenges necessary to realize the future state of identity on the web will take a collective effort of vendor collaboration, standards contributions, practical implementations and education. In order to create adoption of this technology at scale, we should consider the following as concrete next steps we can all take to bring this vision to&nbsp;life:</p><p>Continue to drive development of bridging technologies that integrate well with existing identity solutions and provide a path to decentralized and portable&nbsp;identity</p>  E.g. formalization of OIDC Credential Provider to extend existing&nbsp;IdPs  <p>Empower users to exercise autonomy and sovereignty in selecting their service provider, as well as the ability to change providers and manage services over&nbsp;time</p>  E.g. selection mechanisms introduced by SIOP and&nbsp;WebID  <p>Adopt a holistic approach to building solutions that recognizes the role of browser-mediated interactions in preserving user&nbsp;privacy</p>  E.g. newer browser developments such as CHAPI and&nbsp;WebID  <p>Build solutions that make as few assumptions as necessary in order to support different types of deployment environments that show up in real-world use&nbsp;cases</p>  E.g. evolution of SIOP as well as supporting web and native&nbsp;wallets  <p>Ensure that the development of decentralized digital identity supports the variety and diversity of data that may be managed by users in the future, whether that data be identity-related or otherwise</p><p>Taking these steps will help to ensure that the identity technologies we build to support the digital infrastructure of tomorrow will avoid perpetuating the inequalities and accessibility barriers we face today. By doing our part to collaborate and contribute to solutions that work for everybody, building bridges rather than building siloes, we can create a paradigm shift that has longevity and resilience far into the future. We hope you join&nbsp;us.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/the-state-of-identity-on-the-web-cffc392bc7ea">The State of Identity on the Web</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>みなさん、フランスの２０世紀の作曲家、ダマーズの「フルート、オーボエ、クラリネットとピアノのための四重奏」をご存知でしょうか？いかにもフランスという洒脱な曲です。リンクを貼ったのは二楽章ですが、ダマーズはこれに限らず第二楽章に楽しいものがおおいです。</p>



<p>ダマーズはコルトーの弟子で、フォーレのノクチュルヌとバルカローレの全曲録音を最初にした人でもあります。</p>



<p>新古典主義の作曲だったので20世紀にはあまり評価されていませんでしたが、最近評価が上がってきて録音も手に入るようになってきています。いかにもフランス的。プーランクが好きだったらダマーズも好きだと思います。</p>

<p>On March 9, The Vienna Digital Identity Meetup* hosted presentations from Xavier Vila, Product Manager for Validated ID and Dr. Ignacio Alamillo, Director of Astrea on eIDAS and Self Sovereign Identity.  The presentations covered the technical, legal and business dimensions of bridging between eIDAS and SSI concepts and increasing the value and usability of digital identity in the European model.</p><p>A key component of the Digital Europe architecture is the existence of a trusted and secure digital identity infrastructure.  This journey was started in 2014 with the implementation of the eIDAS Regulation.  As has been discussed in previous Vienna Digital Identity Meetups, a high assurance digital identity is the key piece connecting the physical and digital worlds, and this piece was not included in the initial creation of our digital world.</p><p>Why then is eIDAS v1 not seen as a success?  There are many reasons; from parts of the regulation that focused or constrained its use into the public sphere only, to the lack of total coverage across all of the EU.  Likely the key missing piece was that the cultural climate was not yet ripe and the state of digital identity was really not ready.  Too many technical problems were yet to be solved. Without these elements the realized state of eIDAS should not be unexpected.  All this said, eIDAS v1 laid very important groundwork and created an environment to gather important learnings to allow eIDAS v2 to realize the hoped for levels of success and adoption.</p><p>Validated ID has been developing a eIDAS - ESSIF bridge bringing the eIDAS trust seals to Verifiable Credentials.  As a  Qualified Trust Service Provider under the eIDAS, Validated ID has been offering trust services to customers across Europe since 2012.  Xavier presented this current work and provides a detailed explanation on how the eIDAS-SSI bridge applies the qualified electronic seals to Verifiable Credentials.</p><p>Dr. Alamillo further clarified the importance of the eIDAS-SSI Bridge in his presentation on SSI in the eIDAS Regulation.  When a Qualified Electronic Seal is applied to a Verifiable Credential the combined document becomes a legal document with cross border legal value within the EU.  Currently in an identity context, eIDAS is the European wide identity meta system, providing the framework for the 27 nation states of the EU to operate as a very large federated identity network.  However, the point was raised the in the current ongoing revision of the eIDAS regulation, it is possible that handling of electronic identification may be changed from a ‘connecting of services’ to a new trust service.</p><p><br></p><p>To listen to a recording of the event please check out the link: <a href="https://vimeo.com/522501200">https://vimeo.com/522501200</a></p><p>Time markers: </p>  <p>0:00:00 - Introduction </p>  <p>0:04:00 - Xavier Vila, Validated ID </p>  <p>0:34:00 - Questions </p>  <p>0:42:00 - Dr. Ignacio Alamillo, Astrea </p>  <p>1:18:00 - Questions </p>  <p>1:28:00 - Wrap-up &amp; Upcoming Events  </p>  <p>Resources</p><p>SSI - eIDAS Bridge GitHub Repo - <a href="https://github.com/validatedid/ssi-eidas-bridge/">https://github.com/validatedid/ssi-eidas-bridge/</a></p><p>Xavier Vila’s Presentation Deck: <a href="https://www.thedinglegroup.com/s/210308-Vienna-Identity-Meetup-SSI-eIDAS-Bridge.pdf">Vale-SSI-EIDAS Bridge.pdf<br>Nach</a>o Alamillo’s Presentation Deck: <a href="https://www.thedinglegroup.com/s/Vienna-digital-identity-event-eIDAS-Alamillo.pdf">Alamillo-SSI-EIDAS.pdf</a></p><p>And as a reminder,  we continue to have online only events. </p><p>If interested in getting notifications of upcoming events please join the event group at: https://www.meetup.com/Vienna-Digital-Identity-Meetup/ </p><p>*The Vienna Digital Identity Meetup is hosted by The Dingle Group and is focused on educating business, societal, legal and technologists on the new opportunities that arise with  a high assurance digital identity created by the reduction risk and strengthened provenance.

<p>An idea has been maturing in my thoughts for a while now. Or rather I have been thinking about a series of ideas, programming projects I would love to actualise, which I recently realised share a common thread. Memory and how we access it. Probably not surprising for software developers, pretty much any application we can imagine requires some form of data store. Although rarely, in my experience, do we talk about this data in terms of memory.</p>
<p>My more recent work researching identity, privacy and trust in digital interactions has evolved and broadened my perspective on the importance of memory. Our identity, whatever we conceive that to be, must be understood to exist in close relation to memory. Or the mathematician in me wants to say as a function of memory I ~ F(m) <a>1</a>. And as Herbert Simon details in the Science of the Artificial, memory is a key property of any intelligent system <a>2</a>.  The ability to take information from the past and apply it when navigating the present moment is a powerful skill in the Homo Sapien toolbox, both as individuals and a species.</p>
<p>These patterns of thought on memory percolating in my mind have further been influenced through my engagement with blockchain/distributed ledger both as a concept and through the practical application of it in application development. I especially find the ideas coming out of the Ethereum community transformative to the possibilities for digital application design. Persistent Compute Objects (PICOs) <a>3</a> are a more recent idea and open source project I have been following that appears to support novel interaction patterns.</p>
<p>It has been an interesting journey to this point, what follows in a sketch of the evolution of my thoughts on memory told through the lens of three ideas and the questions these ideas sparked in me. Then I intend to reflect on where my thoughts are at now, because it is only now reflecting on these ideas that I see the common thread - human memory. </p>
<p>The ideas that influenced my thinking and help illustrate my thoughts are; Viewing Time, The Community Mind and Nifty Books. Each originates at a different point in my life but all were ideas for programming side projects I could use to cut my teeth on a new technology, language or library. Each idea has a special place in my own memory, and it is from these memories that the thoughts I am sharing emerged.</p>
 Viewing Time 
<p>My first idea, back before I knew how to program. The inspirational carrot I used to motivate myself to learn. Not that I ever wrote more than a few lines of code on this. It originates from a time in Maastricht visiting a friend, we were sitting looking at a beautiful view and I thought: </p>
 What if we could create a timelapse of a view from a specific location? A View of Time. 
<p>I think I tried to get my friend to go back their every day to take a photo to do just this. Not the ideal solution, my thinking has evolved since then. Here are some of the questions I thought about:</p>
 
 
<p>What if we could crowd source the collection of the photos for a view, enabling anyone with a camera to contribute?</p>
 
 How would view’s of time be discovered, found, contributed to and viewed? 
 
<p>How would you prevent “bad” view from being added. Inappropriate, non valued, etc?</p>
 
 Who decides what a “bad” view is? 
 Authorisation problem 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Where would views be stored?</p>
 
 Who stores them? 
 Who has control over them? 
 Who manages that control? 
 
 
 Who would host and pay for this application and why? 
 
<p>How might Viewing Time change our relationship with our environment and help us reflect on the change happening all around us?</p>
 
 Chasing Ice, a documentary I watched on another visit to the Netherlands, emphasised how powerful this could be. <a href="https://earthvisioninstitute.org/share-this/columbia-glacier-alaska/">Here is an example</a>. 
 Watching a Chinese cityscape evolve over these last 20 years would have provided another staggering view of time and change. 
 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/mar/21/timelapse-satellite-images-china-fastest-growing-cities">Here are some examples of this using satellite imagery</a> 
 How might Viewing Time help communities record and interact with shared memories? 
 I was recently involved with planting a Community Orchard and became aware how valuable creating a view as a shared artifact could be. It might help communities celebrate and appreciate the positive changes they bring about. 
 
 
 How might date, time or season be used to present different time-lapses of the same view? 
 
<p>How would we prevent overtourism?</p>
 
 I never wanted to turn view’s into used and abused tourist spaces, an acknowledged tension. 
 Explicitly want to avoid insta tourism type effects. How?  
 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Trs-isdu4eE">This is a funny add from the Kiwi’s recently keeping me mindful of this</a> 
 What are the incentives? 
 How do we ensure this is an artifact all can enjoy while minimising the unintended consequences associated with the change in context-relative informational norms? 
 How might this be used to create incentives for positive, respectful tourism? 
 Realised in part this is about how views are discovered. 
 This got me closer to the importance of location. 
 
 
 
<p>What if you could only discover view’s if you were in it’s location?</p>
 
 How might this help to prevent bad content? 
 How would you even prove you were in a certain location? 
 Who/what would you prove it to? 
 
 
 
<p>What is the context and associated informational norms with a View?</p>
 
 Who defines and evolves these norms? 
 What are the rules? 
 
 
 How might location be used as a strong authenticator?<a>4</a> 
 
<p>These are all pointers, sketching the outlines of thought that I have been evolving over the 5 or so years since first appeared in my mind. </p>
<p>It is an idea that I never made any meaningful, tangible progress on. Except for a few positive conversations with friends it has remained wishful thinking. It is in my humble opinion, a beauty of an idea, something that I would love to see happen. I am optimistic, the technology and mental model for application design is shifting in ways that open up an entirely new design space for these kinds of ideas. Something other than the for profit venture capitalist endeavours that have lead to the colonisation and privatisation of much of our virtual spaces. A for-profit venture could never be the best realisation of this idea.</p>
 The Community Mind 
<p>
      <a>
    
  
  </a>
    </p>
<p>This is my baby. My first <a href="https://wip-abramson.dev/sideproject">side project</a>. It is how I learnt React and felt the power of GraphQl. The first website and server I ever deployed - a challenging experience but one I <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/lessons-learned-from-deploying-my-first-full-stack-web-application-34f94ec0a286/">learnt from</a>.  It is was also my first encounter with authentication and account management, what a nightmare that was.</p>
<p>After completing a year in industry this was the next programming project I worked on. I committed a lot of my time to this work. Including spending a month straight on it while dipping my toes into the digital nomad lifestyle in Chiang Mai, where I was exposed to and became fascinated with blockchain, Bitcoin and all that crazy stuff. An influential period of my life really. </p>
<p>Anyway, the idea revolves around creating a place for us to organise our questions. A space for questions to be shared and thought about, but not a place to collect answers. In my mind it was explicitly not for answers. Rather it would provide triggers to thought’s within individuals as they pondered these questions from the their own unique perspective shaped by their lived experience. I am a strong believe that we all have the ability to imagine creative ideas and possibilities, the hard part of course is actioning those ideas. As in many ways this text demonstrates.</p>
<p>The initial inspiration for this idea came from the book <a href="https://amorebeautifulquestion.com/">A More Beautiful Question</a>. I wanted to try to develop something that would make it easier to ask and discover beautiful questions. A place where these questions could be crowd sourced, recorded and connected.  I wanted to provide an interface for individuals to explore a web of interconnected questions being thought by others. I wanted people to be able to contribute their own questions and thought pathways to this network. Each individual interacting with and contributing to the community mind.</p>
<p>The questions that surfaced when thinking through the design requirements of such a project were something along these lines:</p>
 
 
<p>How will I manage questioners?</p>
 
 I was still thinking in a user account paradigm in these days.  
 Who gets to ask questions? 
 Who gets to see the questions asked? 
 
 
 
<p>How will questioners search and discover the questions they are interested in?</p>
 
 What if questions could be linked to other questions? 
 Who can link questions to other questions? Which links do people see and how do they decide? 
 What if these links grew in strength the more they were traversed and endorsed like neural pathways in our own minds? 
 
 
 
<p>How will we prevent duplicate questions?</p>
 
 Am I trying to create a single global repository of questions?  
 
<p>Or would it be better to allow each individual to manage their web of questions independently?</p>
 
 How might you enable the best of both? 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>How will we prevent bad data? Questions that don’t align with the ethos of the mind?</p>
 
 Whose mind? Who decides? 
 How might questions be optimally curated? 
 What is optimal and who is curating? 
 
 
 Where would this information be stored?  
 
<p>What is the business model for such an application?</p>
 
 What are the incentives? 
 
 
 
<p>When initially developing this project I had in mind a database for storing questions and their links, which people would interact with. Searching and filtering to discover the questions they were interested in. Contributing their own questions and connections to this storage. All managed by some centralised application, providing a single view and interface for people to interact with. Today, I have a model of individual’s being able to maintain their own mind, curating the questions and connections that find useful to them. Then providing a mechanism to network and aggregate the minds of others into a larger web of questions for all to explore. Imagine a mind like a GitHub repository, the entity that creates it would be able to manage the rules governing how questions and links are contributed. I even considered private minds as a potential business model. Although my desire was and remains today to develop an open source tool for recording, curating and discovering beautiful questions. I see them as a loose scaffold around thought, hinting at the problem space without prescribing the solution. A common entry point to creativity, that any individual from any background at any moment in time would be able to interact with. Using their own unique perspective to draw new insights and inspire different solutions.</p>
<p>I have a lot of fond memories developing this idea, including a weekend in Porto visiting a friend where I discovered the joy and value of committing thoughts to paper. Creating a physical artifact to interact with. Something that in my view can never fully be replicated in a digital medium, but what if you could have both?</p>

<p>Towards the end of my <a href="https://github.com/wip-abramson/TheCommunityMind">active development</a> of this idea I attempted to integrate a token, Simple Token, as part of a challenge they held. My idea at the time was to use this as some form of incentive mechanism for the application, although the actual execution was a bit clumsy looking back. You can view my submission <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMABXKGoiAk&amp;t=1s">here</a>. Then there is this old <a href="https://github.com/Blockternship/projects/issues/5">Github issue</a> from a month long hackathon called Blockternship. </p>
<p>While development is dormant, I am still very committed to making this a thing. One day!</p>
 Nifty Books 
<p>This is another lovely idea, in my book at least. Originating from my desire to learn how to write smart contracts using solidity, the Ethereum programming language. The idea stemmed from thinking through how we might digitally represent books the books we own, creating a distributed library and opening access to a wealth of books. Moving them off our shelves and into peoples hands, helping the wisdom held within them diffuse into more peoples minds and become recorded in their memories. Book’s can provide an intoxicating fountain of knowledge or a refreshing escape from reality. I appreciate both aspects equally and would love more to experience their joy. </p>
<p>For a bit of history of this idea you can see <a href="https://github.com/ethberlin-hackathon/ETHBerlin-Teambuilding/issues/23">my proposal</a> for the ETH Berlin hackathon around this. I proposed creating an application that allowed anyone to mint an <a href="http://erc721.org/">ERC721 Non-Fungible Token</a> to represent their physical book. Unfortunately, I ended up forming a different team and haven’t made much progress on realising this idea. I remain a sketchy solidity developer at best. That said, progress has been made. The concept is more mature in my mind, and the ethereum development landscape has come a long way since 2018. As my recent experience at the virtual <a href="https://www.ethdenver.com/">ETH Denver</a> highlighted, while I didn’t manage to submit anything or even write much code I did get a sense for how far things have come. The <a href="https://github.com/austintgriffith/scaffold-eth">scaffold-eth</a> repo seems like a great place to start, if I ever do manage to carve out time to create this.</p>
<p>I am convinced, and regularly reminded, how this idea could unlock so much hidden value. Book’s deserve to be read more than once, indeed there is something beautiful about a book having been read by many different people. Throughout the course of my studies in Edinburgh I have developed a fairly extensive personal collection of some truly fascinating books. I would love to have a means to share them with others in the area also interested in this material. And yes I am sure there exist ways for me to do this if I really tried, but I believe giving a book a memory has more implications that simply making it easily shareable.</p>
<p>Here are a few questions that this idea has raised over the years as I wondered about how it might be developed:</p>
 
 
<p>How might we digitally represent a physical book?</p>
 
 How would you link the physical book with it’s digital representation? 
 Would a QR Code work here? 
 
 
 
<p>How might we represent ownership?</p>
 
 What affordances should owners of books have? 
 What affordances should borrower’s have? 
 
 
 
<p>How would books within the virtual library be discovered, requested and returned?</p>
 
 How might you pay for postage of book between participants? 
 
<p>What if the model was to create primarily a local virtual library, but with exchanges between localities when requested?</p>
 
 Libraries have existed like this for ages. 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>How might the digital representation of a book be used to embed it with a memory?</p>
 
 What information would the book want to store in it’s memory? 
 How might we represent the list of borrowers without compromising their privacy? 
 
<p>What if the book had an interface to the Community Mind allowing readers to ask and share questions that the material provoked in them?</p>
 
 How might being in possession of a book, either as a lender or borrower provide a mechanism for access control into other applications? E.g. the Community Mind. 
 
 
 What can we learn from the way individuals interact with eBook’s today? 
 How might this approach help us appreciate this medium more deeply? 
 
 
 
<p>How might we deter bad actors abusing the virtual library?</p>
 
 What is the incentive model? 
 Who decides? 
 What is to stop malicious actors creating virtual book’s unattached to physical copies?  
 What prevents people from stealing book’s they have borrowed? 
 
 
 Who stores the information around virtual books?  
 
<p>How are the search and discovery capabilities for these books mediated? </p>
 
 Who is mediating this? 
 
 
 What can we learn from the way book’s are shared and exchanged by travellers? 
 
<p>What if the things we bought came with a configurable and extendable digital memory?</p>
 
 How might this both simplify and expand the field of interaction enabled and perceived by those in proximity to the device? 
 
 
 
<p>As usual, a whole load of questions. Always there are questions. I present them here to provoke your own thought and inquiry around these ideas.</p>
 The Common Thread 
<p>Now, these ideas are not directly or intentionally linked. They are connected through me, and through my desire to produce ideas for software applications I would be motivated to create. Most developers you meet will have a few of these kicking around if you ask them. Over time all ideas evolve, dots connect and new insight emerges. The three ideas I presented trace the evolution of me, as much as anything else, from a computer science undergraduate to hopefully a final year PhD student. </p>
<p>It is only recently, from the new perspectives my research has provided me that I can reflect on all these ideas and clearly see a common thread in my thinking. In keeping with the article will summarise in a series of questions:</p>
 
 
<p>How might we use technology to experiment with the ways in which we can attach memory to the artifacts we place meaning in?</p>
 
 How might we design this memory to be open and extendable supporting permission-less innovation at the edges? 
 
 
 
<p>How might artifacts use this memory to intelligently interact with it’s environment and the people interacting with it?</p>
 
 How might such artifacts be designed to respect the privacy of those it interacts with while ensuring they are held accountable within a defined context? 
 
 
 
<p>What if we started to centralise information on artifacts, using our physical interaction with these artifacts to provide an alternative to the search engine for the discovery of information?</p>
 
 How might centralising information on the artifact, be that a location, object or thought transform the way  design digital systems and our ability to actively maintain collective memory at all scales of society? 
 
 
 How might context-relative informational norms for managing this memory be defined, communicated, upheld and evolved? 
 How might such artifacts change the way we identify and authenticate digitally? 
 
<p>How might this change the nature of the virtual spaces we interact in?</p>
 
 How might this provide natural limits to the participants within these spaces? 
 How might this create virtual neighbours and encourage trustworthy behaviour and positive relationships? 
 
 
 
<p>What are the descriptive and normative properties for structuring memory?</p>
 
 What are the properties of collective memory that we experience in the majority of virtual environments we exist in today and how do they differ from the ways we have managed memory in the physical reality across time and context? 
 
 
 
<p>It is an exploration of the structure of memory, how we might augment this structure with intention using digital technology and the implications of this on meaning making within both individuals and groups. To date this exploration has predominantly involved a few powerful entities constructing, owning and manipulating the digital structures of memory to meet their own agenda’s <a>5</a>. </p>
<p>It is also interesting to me that while working on this idea I created artifacts, both physical and digital, they hold meaning to me but are no longer only accessible too me. By committing thoughts to paper, code or words, they become remembered at least partially in a different kind of memory. Indeed this text itself is one of these artifacts.</p>
<p>I could go on, but it’s long already and I wrote this for fun more than anything. A break from the rigidity of academic writing that can be suffocating at times. A more detailed, formal analysis of these ideas is for another time. </p>
<p>Thanks for making it this far. These thoughts are pretty fresh, I would love to know what they triggered in you. </p>
 
 
 
 
<p>This is something my thoughts wander across on occasion. I am always drawn the ideas in quantum field theory where particles exist in a field of potential, it is only upon measurement that the field collapses. Feels like there is something interesting in having a similar mental model for identity.</p>

<p>One idea that stuck with me from this is location based authentication. This is one of the reasons I was so interested by the <a href="https://foam.space/location">FOAM project</a>, although it seems a long way from reaching it’s potential at the moment.

<a href="https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/uploads/web_dev_pillar_page.jpg">https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/uploads/web_dev_pillar_page.jpg</a> Why developer-first IAM&nbsp;? And why Okta’s Auth0 acquisition matters? <p>In my previous blog, <a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com/the-next-tcp-ip-moment-in-identity-464fdb559f3b">The Next TCP/IP Moment in Identity</a>, I discussed why the enterprises will demand for developer-first IAM. As every company is becoming a software company, and starting to build their competitive advantage on the software they build, the developer-first IAM will free the developers from inherent complexities in doing Identity integrations.</p><p>The <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/okta-auth0-announcement/">announcement</a> came yesterday on Okta’s intention to acquire Auth0 for $6.5B, which is probably 40 times the Auth0’s current revenue, is a true validation of the push towards developer-first IAM. However, this is not Okta’s first effort towards developer-first IAM. In 2017, Okta acquired Stormpath, a company that built tools to help developers to integrate login with their apps. Stormpath soon got absorbed into the Okta platform, but yet, Okta’s selling strategy didn’t change. It was always top-down.</p><p>In contrast to Okta, Auth0 follows a bottom-up sales strategy. One of the analysts I spoke to couple of years back told that the Auth0 name comes in an inquiry call only when a developer joins in. The acquisition of Auth0 will give Okta, the access to a broader market. So, it is important for Okta to let Auth0 run as an independent business, as also mentioned in the acquisition announcement.</p><p>Auth0 is not just about the product; but also the developer tooling, content and the developer community around it. Okta will surely benefit from this ecosystem around Auth0. Also, for years, Azure is the primary competitor of Okta, and Auth0 acquisition will make Okta stronger against Azure in the long&nbsp;run.</p><p>Late 2020, in one of the the earnings calls, the Okta announced that it sees the total market for its workplace identity management software as $30 billion, but it sees another, additional market for customer identity software at $25 billion. In the customer Identity space, when we talk to enterprises, they bring in their unique requirements. In many cases they look for a product that can be used to build an agile, event-driven customer Identity (CIAM) platform that can flex to meet frequently changing business requirements. The developer-first IAM is more critical in building a CIAM solution than in workforce IAM. In the latest Forrester <a href="https://wso2.com/resources/analyst-reports/the-forrester-wave-customer-identity-and-access-management-q4-2020/">report</a> on CIAM, Auth0 is way ahead of Okta, in terms of the current product offering. Okta will probably use Auth0 to increase their presence in the CIAM domain. Like Microsoft has Azure AD to focus on workforce IAM and Azure B2C to focus on CIAM, Auth0 could be Okta’s offering for&nbsp;CIAM.</p>Forrester CIAM Wave&nbsp;2020<p>When Auth0 was founded in 2013, it picked a less-saturated (even right to say fresh), future-driven market segment in IAM — developer-first. Developer-first is all about the experience. Auth0 did extremely well there. They were worried about building the right level of developer experience, rather than the feature set. Even today, Auth0 stands against others not because of their feature set, but the experience they build for developers.</p><p>The developer-first experience is not only about the product. How you build product features in a developer-first manner, probably contribute 50% of the total effort. The rest is about developer tooling, SDKs, and the content. Then again, the content is not just about the product. The larger portion of the content needs to be on how to integrate the product with a larger ecosystem — and also to teach developers the basic constructs, concepts and best practices in IAM. That helps to win the developer trust!</p>How the Auth0 website looked like in July,&nbsp;2014<p>Auth0’s vision towards developer-first IAM evolved over the past. The way the Auth0 website itself evolved in terms of the messaging and the presentation, reflects how much they want to be on the enterprisy side more today than in the past. As they claim Auth0 has 9000+ enterprise customers, which probably generate $150M annual revenue, the average sales value (ASV) would be around $16500. That probably means, the majority of Auth0 customers are in free/developer/developer pro tiers. So, it’s understandable why they want to bring in enterprise look and messaging, probably moving forward to focus more on top-down driven sales strategy. The big Contact Sales button over the Signup button on the Auth0 website today, sums up this direction to some extent.The Okta’s acquisition of Auth0 could probably strengthen this&nbsp;move.</p>How the Auth0 website looks like today (March,&nbsp;2021)<p>Like Microsoft’s acquisition of GitHub for $7.5B in 2018, Okta’s acquisition of Auth0 for $6.5B is a win for developers! Congratulations to both Auth0 and Okta and very much looking forward to see the journey of Auth0 together with&nbsp;Okta.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com/why-developer-first-iam-and-why-oktas-auth0-acquisition-matters-9fff3dde81">Why developer-first IAM and why Okta’s Auth0 acquisition matters?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com">FACILELOGIN</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>February 22,&nbsp;2021</p><p>The Honorable Xavier&nbsp;Becerra</p><p>California State&nbsp;Capitol</p><p>SENT VIA&nbsp;EMAIL</p><p>Dear Attorney General&nbsp;Becerra,</p><p>On behalf of the Blockchain Advocacy Coalition, an organization of blockchain and virtual currency businesses in California, I write to bring to your attention a pending federal regulation that would preempt and refute many of the important privacy protections your office has led the nation on. On December 18, 2020 the US Treasury led by Steve Mnuchin, released a concerning proposed rule that would put into place first of its kind reporting requirements for virtual currencies and digital assets. The agency initially proposed a 15 day comment period over the holidays due to unsubstantiated ‘national security concerns’. After widespread pushback from private citizens, virtual currency companies and members of Congress, the Treasury Department provided another 15 days for reporting requirements and an additional 45 for recordkeeping and counterparting reporting. Fortunately the Biden administration, faced with an avalanche of such poorly thought out rules, gave a 60 day pause and extension on the rulemaking and now the industry is facing a March 1st deadline to comment on a rule that would significantly stifle innovation, limit access to these new products and massively extend the reach of government surveillance of financial transactions far beyond the Bank Secrecy Act&nbsp;(BSA).</p><p>If it were to become policy, this rule would preempt California’s consumer privacy laws, significantly weakening the data privacy protections around financial information voters deemed important when approving the Californian Privacy Rights Act in November of 2020. While many parties have opined on the slapdash process and lack of clarity in the proposed rule, we do not believe that the blatant and far reaching consumer privacy implications have been brought to attention&nbsp;. Your office has led the charge implementing and enforcing the nation’s first and strongest consumer privacy framework, particularly for sensitive financial information. Because of this, we wanted to raise the following concerns with the proposed FinCEN rulemaking and ask for your action. The proposed rule complements existing BSA requirements applicable to banks and MSBs (money service business) by proposing to add reporting requirements for virtual currency transactions exceeding $10,000 in value. Pursuant to the proposed rule, banks and MSBs will have 15 days from the date on which a reportable transaction occurs to file a report with FinCEN. Further, this proposed rule would require banks and MSBs to keep&nbsp;records</p><p>of a customer’s virtual currency transactions and counterparties, including verifying the identity of their customers, if a counterparty uses an unhosted or otherwise covered wallet and the transaction is greater than&nbsp;$3,000.</p><p>Our concerns with the consumer privacy implications of this proposed rule are&nbsp;twofold:</p><p>First, the proposed rule’s requirement that MSB’s collect identifying information associated with wallet addresses will create reporting that extends well beyond the intent of the rule or the transaction. According to the EFF “For some cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, transaction data — including users’ Bitcoin addresses — is permanently recorded on a public blockchain. That means that if you know the name of the user associated with a particular Bitcoin address, you can glean information about all of their Bitcoin transactions that use that address.” California consumers do not have the expectation that a future reporting requirement will link to their entire financial transaction history from that&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>Second, this rule creates requirements for disclosure of counterparty information beyond what the BSA requires banks and other financial institutions to collect. It wouldn’t only require these businesses to collect information about their own customers, but also the information of anyone who transacts with those customers using their own cryptocurrency wallets. Specifically:</p>  The name and physical address of each counterparty to the transaction of the financial institution’s customer;  Other counterparty information the Secretary may prescribe as mandatory on the reporting form for transactions subject to reporting pursuant to § 1010.316(b);  Any other information that uniquely identifies the transaction, the accounts, and, to the extent reasonably available, the parties involved;  <p>Unlike KYC (know your customer) requirements which arise from a direct customer relationship, KYCC (know your customer’s counterparty) requirements unreasonably obligate non-customers to provide personally identifying information to a VASP/MSB (virtual asset service provide/money services business) they do not know or do business with, and whose security and privacy practices they have not evaluated, simply because they happen to transact with one of its customers.</p><p>In its haste, the Treasury did not adequately consider the impact of these rules on consumer privacy for those that choose to use virtual currency and would create large scale government surveillance of small personal transactions. We call upon your leadership and expertise in this space to once again lead the charge for consumer protections and submit a comment letter opposing these portions of the proposed rule. Thank you for your consideration and please do not hesitate to reach out with any questions.</p><p>Kind Regards,</p><p>Ally Medina</p><p>Director, Blockchain Advocacy Coalition</p>

<p>Loved reading the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ask-Your-Developer-Software-Developers/dp/0063018292">Ask Your Developer: How to Harness the Power of Software Developers and Win in the 21st Century</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffiel">Jeff&nbsp;Lawson</a>.</p><p>Jeff says in the book that every company is on a journey to becoming a software company and everyone is starting to see the world through the lens of software. He defines the term, software person. A software person is not necessarily a developer, it’s anybody who, when faced with a problem, asks the question, how can software solve this&nbsp;problem?</p> Build vs. Buy (or vs.&nbsp;Die) <p>In the book, Jeff takes the popular debate, build vs. buy, to another dimension; build vs die. As every company is becoming a software company, the competitive advantage they build is in the software they build. When software becomes the interface where the services you offer, meet the customers; unless you build it in the way you want; you&nbsp;die!</p><p>Building what you want gives you the freedom to experiment (or innovate). More you experiment or the ability to experiment more, gives you the edge to understand your customers more. Hence, you grow your business.</p><p>Build, does not necessarily mean building everything from scratch. You don’t build anything that already exists, given that it provides what you need. You only build things that are core to your business, which help building your competitive advantage over all the others. The rest, or the building blocks that help you build what you wish are part of the digital supply&nbsp;chain.</p> The Digital Supply&nbsp;Chain <p>Uber, for example, uses 4000+ microservices internally. However, not all of them are developed by Uber itself. Uber uses Google Maps API to pull out location data, the Twilio API to facilitate communication between passengers and drivers and many other APIs. All these APIs are coming from the digital supply chain Uber picks to build its product. Then again, these building blocks in Uber’s digital supply chain are also available to Lyft, and other Uber competitors around the world. What brings Uber the competitive advantage is in what they&nbsp;build!</p><p>The software you build, can be your product, at the same time it can be a building block for another product. Google Maps is Google’s product, however the Google Maps API is a building block for Uber. Alexa is a product of Amazon, however Alexa API is a a building block for&nbsp;Nissan.</p><p>Picking the right digital supply chain is equally important as what you pick to build. Think, what if Uber had to build something equivalent to Google Maps from the scratch? From 2016 to 2018, Uber paid 58M USD to Google for using Google Maps. But, then again it’s a peanut, when you compare that with their revenue in 2019, which was 14.15 billion&nbsp;USD.</p><p>Having the right digital supply chain helps you to optimize your development team to build only what you need and no more. Instagram, for example, was only a 13 people team, when Facebook acquired it for $1B in 2012; and WhatsApp team was only 50, when Facebook acquired it for $19B in&nbsp;2014.</p> Build Your Own Identity&nbsp;Stack? <p>Every service you develop, every API you design, every device you use, every person you interact with, will have a managed identity, and in today’s hyperconnected world, the Identity integrations with these business applications and systems, is going to be critical.</p><p>Going back to the build vs. die debate; do you still have to build the Identity stack to gain the competitive advantage in your business? If you are in the Identity business, of course yes, for all the others no. Identity stack you need to build your product is a building block in the digital supply&nbsp;chain.</p><p>You never worried about building a TCP/IP stack yourself, so, don’t worry about building an Identity stack yourself. However, over the time we have spoken to over a thousand companies (hundreds of them are WSO2 customers), and in most of the cases they bring in unique identity requirements. The uniqueness comes in those requirements are specific to the industry they are in and also specific to the complexity of the business problem they want to&nbsp;solve.</p><p>Identity is core to any business, and how you manage identity will also help you in building competitive advantage. At WSO2, we have worked with 90% of the Identity Server customers to solve complex identity problems. Identity Server is open source, and if the business problem is straightforward, they don’t even talk to us, they simply use the product as it is. However, when we work with complex Identity requirements, we have extended the product to solve specific business problems.</p><p>Building these extensions, specific to unique business requirements helped companies to differentiate themselves from others. Then again, they didn’t want to build everything from scratch — rather they started with what’s common (and available to everyone) and started innovating on that. That drastically reduced the time-to-market, and also gave the freedom to innovate.</p><p>I don’t intend to contradict with what I mentioned before, that the Identity stack is part of the digital supply chain you pick, however, the Identity stack you pick for the digital supply chain should have the flexibility to extend with minimal effort to build business requirements specific to your business.</p> The TCP/IP Moment in&nbsp;Identity <p>In the 70’s, having support for TCP/IP in a product was considered to be a competitive advantage. Today, it’s given, and nobody worries about TCP/IP support; it’s everywhere.</p><p>Ian Glazer from Salesforce, mentioned in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZPd584l6o&amp;ab_channel=KuppingerCole">keynote</a> at the European Identity Conference 2016 that, it’s the TCP/IP moment in Identity now. He in fact talked about the open standards (SAML, OpenID Connect, OAuth, SCIM, XACML and so on) in the Identity domain, and how they are going to be part of every product, so no Identity vendor is going to gain competitive advantage just by supporting the open standards. RFPs looking for Identity products will not even worry about asking support for these open standards.</p> The Next TCP/IP Moment in&nbsp;Identity <p>Developers do not worry about building a TCP/IP stack, or even worrying about TCP/IP while building software. We believe, the Identity integrations with business applications and systems need to be developer-first (or developer-focused) with the right level of abstractions and tools. And, doing that right, would be the next TCP/IP moment in Identity, that will free the developers from worrying about complexities in Identity integrations.</p> The Developer-first IAM <p>The single Identity administrator role has started diminishing, and the role of the developer is becoming more prominent in Identity integrations. These developers need a better abstraction over core identity concepts; and the developer-first IAM is the way to realize the next TCP/IP moment in Identity.</p><p>In the consumer Identity space, when we talk to enterprises, they bring in their unique requirements. In many cases they look for a product that can be used to build an agile, event-driven consumer Identity (CIAM) platform that can flex to meet frequently changing business requirements.</p><p>A developer-first IAM product builds an abstraction over the core Identity concepts in the form of APIs and SDKs, provides tools for troubleshooting, has the ability to integrate with the organization’s build pipeline, carries the right level of developer experience and has the ability to extend product’s core capabilities to fit into organization’s complex IAM requirements.</p><p>As every company is becoming a software company, and starting to build their competitive advantage on the software they build, the developer-first IAM will free the developers from inherent complexities in doing Identity integrations. That’s the next TCP/IP moment in Identity!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com/the-next-tcp-ip-moment-in-identity-464fdb559f3b">The Next TCP/IP Moment in Identity</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com">FACILELOGIN</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>
