  <p><a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-49">Datasette 0.49</a> is out. Some notes on what's new.</p>
 API for writable canned queries 
<blockquote>
<p>Writable canned queries now expose a JSON API, see <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/sql_queries.html#canned-queries-json-api">JSON API for writable canned queries</a>. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/880">#880</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wrote <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Jun/12/annotated-release-notes/">about writable canned queries</a> when they were introduced in Datasette 0.44 back in June. They provide a mechanism for defining a canned SQL query which can make writes (inserts, updates or deletes) to the underlying SQLite database. They can be protected by <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/authentication.html">Datasette authentication</a> or you can leave them open - for example if you want unauthenticated users to be able to post comments or leave feedback messages.</p>
<p>The missing feature was API support. Datasette 0.49 adds that, so now you can define a canned query that writes to the database and then call it as a JSON API - either without authentication or protected by a mechanism such as that provided by the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-auth-tokens">datasette-auth-tokens</a> plugin.</p>
<p>This feature works with <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Jul/1/datasette-045/">magic parameters</a>, so you can define an API that accepts API traffic and automatically logs things like the incoming IP address. Here's a canned query defined in a <code>metadata.yml</code> file that logs user agent and IP addresses:</p>
  databases:
  logs:
    queries:
      log:
        sql: |-
          INSERT INTO logs (
            user_agent, datetime
          ) VALUES (
            :_header_user_agent, :_now_datetime_utc
          )
        write: true  
<p>Create a SQLite database file called <code>logs.db</code> with the correct table like this:</p>
 <code>$ sqlite-utils create-table logs.db logs id integer user_agent text datetime text --pk=id
</code> 
<p>Confirm the created schema with:</p>
 <code>$ sqlite3 logs.db .schema
CREATE TABLE [logs] (
   [id] INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
   [user_agent] TEXT,
   [datetime] TEXT
);
</code> 
<p>Now start Datasette like so:</p>
 <code>$ datasette logs.db -m metadata.yml
</code> 
<p>And visit <code>http://127.0.0.1:8001/logs/log</code>. You can click the "Run SQL" button there to insert a new log row, which you can then view at <code>http://127.0.0.1:8001/logs/logs</code>.</p>
<p>Next, the API. You can request a JSON response by adding <code>?_json=1</code> to the URL, so try this with <code>curl</code>:</p>
 <code>$ curl -XPOST 'http://127.0.0.1:8001/logs/log?_json=1'
{"ok": true, "message": "Query executed, 1 row affected", "redirect": null}
</code> 
<p>You can also set the <code>Accept: application/json</code> header on your request, like so:</p>
 <code>$ curl -XPOST 'http://127.0.0.1:8001/logs/log' -H 'Accept: application/json'
{"ok": true, "message": "Query executed, 1 row affected", "redirect": null}                                                             ~ % 
</code> 
<p>Or by passing <code>_json=1</code> as part of a POST submission. Let's try that using <code>requests</code>:</p>
 <code>$ ipython
In [1]: import requests
In [2]: requests.post("http://127.0.0.1:8001/logs/log", data={"_json": "1"}).json()
Out[2]: {'ok': True, 'message': 'Query executed, 1 row affected', 'redirect': None}
</code> 
 Path parameters for custom page templates 
<blockquote>
<p>New mechanism for defining page templates with custom path parameters - a template file called <code>pages/about/{slug}.html</code> will be used to render any requests to <code>/about/something</code>. See <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/custom_templates.html#custom-pages-parameters">Path parameters for pages</a>. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/944">#944</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I added custom page support in <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html?highlight=pages#v0-41">Datasette 0.41</a> back in May, based on the needs of my <a href="https://www.niche-museums.com/">Niche Museums</a> site. I wanted an easy way to create things like an <code>/about</code> page that returned content from a custom template.</p>
<p>Custom page templates work as a fallback for Datasette 404s. If <code>/about</code> fails to resolve and Datasette was provided a <code>--template-dir</code> on startup, Datasette will check to see if a template exists called <code>templates/pages/about.html</code>.</p>
<p>Datasette 0.49 adds support for <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/custom_templates.html#path-parameters-for-pages">path parameters</a>, partially inspired by cookiecutter (which showed me that it's OK to create files with curly braces in their name). You can now create templates with <code>{slug}</code> style wildcards as part of their filenames, and Datasette will route matching requests to that template.</p>
<p>I shipped a new release of Niche Museums today that takes advantage of that feature. I wanted neater URLs for museum pages - to shift from <a href="https://www.niche-museums.com/browse/museums/101">https://www.niche-museums.com/browse/museums/101</a> to <a href="https://www.niche-museums.com/101">https://www.niche-museums.com/101</a>.</p>
<p>Here's how it works. I have a template file called <a href="https://github.com/simonw/museums/blob/master/templates/pages/%7Bid%7D.html">templates/pages/{id}.html</a>. That template takes advantage of the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-template-sql">datasette-template-sql</a> plugin, which adds a <code>sql()</code> function that can be called within the template. It starts like this:</p>
  &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
{% set rows = sql("select * from museums where id = :id", {"id": id}) %}
{% if not rows %}
    {{ raise_404("Museum not found") }}
{% endif %}
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
    {% set museum = rows[0] %}
    ... rest of the template here ...  
<p>Datasette made the variable <code>id</code> available to the context having captured it from the <code>{id}.html</code> template matching the incoming URL.</p>
<p>I then use the <code>sql()</code> function to execute a query, passing in <code>id</code> as a query parameter.</p>
<p>If there are no matches, I call the brand new <code>raise_404()</code> template function which cancels the rendering of this template and falls back to Datasette's default 404 handling.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I set the <code>museum</code> variable to <code>rows[0]</code> and continue rendering the page.</p>
<p>I've basically reinvented PHP and ColdFusion in my custom 404 handler. Hooray!</p>
 A few other notable changes 
<blockquote>
<p><code>register_output_renderer()</code> render functions can now return a <code>Response</code>. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/953">#953</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/plugin_hooks.html#register-output-renderer-datasette">register_output_renderer() plugin hook</a> was designed before Datasette had a <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/internals.html#response-class">documented Response class</a>. It asked your plugin to return a custom <code>{"content_type": "...", "body": "...", "status_code": 200, "headers": {}}</code> dictionary.</p>
<p>You can now return a <code>Response</code> instead, and I plan to remove the dictionary version before Datasette 1.0. I released new versions of <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-ics">datasette-ics</a>, <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-atom">datasette-atom</a>, <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-copyable">datasette-copyable</a> and the new <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-yaml">datasette-yaml</a> that use the new return format.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>New <code>--upgrade</code> option for <code>datasette install</code>. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/945">#945</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I added the <code>datasette install datasette-cluster-map</code> command as a thin wrapper around <code>pip install</code>.</p>
<p>This means you can install new plugins without first figuring out which virtual environment your Datasette is running out - particularly useful if you install Datasette <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/installation.html#using-homebrew">using Homebrew</a>.</p>
<p>I then realized that this could be used to upgrade Datasette itself - but only if you could run <code>pip install -U</code>. So now <code>datasette install -U datasette</code> will upgrade Datasette in place.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>New <code>datasette --pdb</code> option. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/962">#962</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is useful if you are working on Datasette itself, or a Datasette plugin. Pass the <code>--pdb</code> option and Datasette will start an interactive Python debugger session any time it hits an exception.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>datasette --get</code> exit code now reflects the internal HTTP status code. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/947">#947</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm excited about the pattern of using <code>datasette --get</code> for running simple soundness checks, e.g. as part of a CI suite. Now that the exit code reflects the status code for the page you can write test scripts that look like this:</p>
 <code># Fail if homepage returns 404 or 500
datasette . --get /
</code> 
<blockquote>
<p>New <code>raise_404()</code> template function for returning 404 errors. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/964">#964</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Demonstrated in the Niche Museums example above.</p>
<p>And the rest:</p>
<blockquote>
 
 
<code>datasette publish heroku</code> now deploys using Python 3.8.5 
 Upgraded <a href="https://codemirror.net/">CodeMirror</a> to 5.57.0. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/948">#948</a>) 
 Upgraded code style to Black 20.8b1. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/958">#958</a>) 
 Fixed bug where selected facets were not correctly persisted in hidden form fields on the table page. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/963">#963</a>) 
 Renamed the default error template from <code>500.html</code> to <code>error.html</code>. 
 Custom error pages are now documented, see <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/custom_templates.html#custom-pages-errors">Custom error pages</a>. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/965">#965</a>) 
 
</blockquote>
<p>In writing up these annotated release notes I spotted <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/967">a bug</a> with writable canned queries, which I have now fixed in <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-49-1">Datasette 0.49.1</a>.</p>

<p>Sophie Zhang worked as the data scientist for the Facebook Site Integrity fake engagement team. She gave up her severance package in order to speak out internally about what she saw there, and someone leaked her memo to BuzzFeed News. It's a hell of a story: she saw bots and coordinated manual accounts used to influence politics in countries all around the world, and found herself constantly making moderation decisions that had lasting political impact. “With no oversight whatsoever, I was left in a situation where I was trusted with immense influence in my spare time". This sounds like a nightmare - imagine taking on responsibility for protecting democracy in so many different places.</p>

<p>Every startup goes through the trough of sorrow. I've found it to be a useful way to describe the period that comes after initial enthusiasm and before things start to work out. It turns out it's quite a useful metaphor for non-startup life, too.</p><p>There are lots of drawings of it out there on the internet. Here's my interpretation:</p><p></p><p>Every new big endeavor comes with an initial rush of enthusiasm. You're elated by the possibilities. This is going to be amazing!</p><p>Then reality sets in, and the deep slide. "Oh fuck," you'll ask yourself. "What do I do now?"</p><p>And that's when you start to experiment. You have to. The thing you thought would work probably won't. Your initial ideas are probably wrong. The story you told yourself during that initial rush of enthusiasm was just that: a story.</p><p>You could stay in this trough of sorrow. Many startups, and many people embarking on creative projects, do just that. They cling too needily to their initial idea, or are ineffective in their experimentation. They run out of steam. Sometimes, when more than one person is involved, they start to fight with each other. (65% of early-stage startups fail because of preventable human dynamics. I would bet that more fail because they run out of hope.)</p><p>You've got to be willing to experiment more rapidly than you're probably comfortable with, using real people (not aggregate statistics or sales figures) as the arbiter of what will work. You've got to be willing to make decisions based on horribly imperfect, qualitative data. You've got to be willing to take a leap of faith. And you've got to be more invested in the journey than in the end product.</p><p>Then maybe - just maybe - you'll make it.</p><p>I've been through the trough of sorrow for virtually every startup I've ever worked at: the two I founded, the two where I was first employee, and the one with a hundred million dollars in the bank. Some made it; some didn't.</p><p>I've also been through the trough of sorrow for every creative project I've ever made. For some of them, I was able to persevere and make it work; others, I abandoned.</p><p>It's about experimentation, it's about luck, it's about treating yourself and your team well, and it's about being able to let go of your precious ideas. If you treat the endeavor as a fait accompli, or go about it as you might in a large organization where you've already found your feet, you will certainly fail. On the other hand, if you embrace a spirit of creative curiosity, there's everything to play for.</p>

  The idea of giving out prizes is not itself obsolete; yet all award practices need to be refactored occasionally to capture the heart of the process of doing science, as this expands and changes in the coming decades. And, if it’s time to refactor the Nobel Prize, what does that suggest for the prizes your learned society hands out? Adding an ecosystem of badges (to show off skills and accomplishments) to the recognition landscape helps to replace prizes as a central feature of open science. Since prizes celebrate brilliant work, and as celebrations as a whole add positive affect to your culture, let the prizes continue. But give them some new thought. What is your idea for Nobel 2.0?

   I'm delighted to say that
Spritely Goblins
v0.7
has been released!
This is the first release featuring
CapTP support
(ie, "capability-secure distributed/networked programming support"),

<p>I'm delighted to say that
<a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/goblins/">Spritely Goblins</a>
<a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblins/-/tree/v0.7">v0.7</a>
has been released!
This is the first release featuring
<a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/goblins/captp.html">CapTP support</a>
(ie, "capability-secure distributed/networked programming support"),
which is a huge milestone for the project!</p>
<p>Okay, caveat... there are still some things missing from the CapTP
stuff so far; you can only set up a bidirectional connection between
two machines, and can't "introduce" capabilities to other machines
on the network.
Also setting up connections is an extremely manual process.
Both of those should be improved in the next release.</p>
<p>But still!
Goblins can now be used to easily write distributed programs!
And Goblins' CapTP code even includes such wild features as
distributed garbage collection!</p>
<p>As an example
(also mentioned in a <a>recent blogpost</a>),
I recently wrote a short
<a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblin-chat">chat program demo</a>.
Both the client and server "protocol" code were
<a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblin-chat/-/blob/master/chat-backend.rkt">less than 250 lines of code</a>,
despite having such features as authenticating users during
subscription to the chatroom and verifying that messages claimed by
the chatroom came from the users it said it did.
(The <a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblin-chat/-/blob/master/goblin-chat-gui.rkt">GUI code</a>,
by contrast, was a little less than 300 lines.)
I wrote this up without writing any network code at all and then
tested hooking together two clients over Tor Onion Services using
Goblins' CapTP support, and it Just Worked (TM):</p>
<p></p>
<p>What's interesting here is that
not a single line of code was added to the backend or GUI to accomodate networking;
the <a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblin-chat/-/blob/master/onion-gui-server.rkt">host</a>
and <a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblin-chat/-/blob/master/onion-gui-client.rkt">guest</a>
modules merely imported the backend and GUI files completely unchanged and
did the network wiring there.
Yes, that's what it sounds like: in Goblins you can write distributed
asynchronous programs </p>
<p>This is the really significant part of Goblins that's starting to
become apparent, and it's all thanks to the brilliant design of
<a href="http://erights.org/elib/distrib/captp/index.html">CapTP</a>.
Goblins continues to stand on the shoulders of giants; thank you to
everyone in the ocap community, but especially in this case
Michael FIG, Mark S. Miller, Kevin Reid, and Baldur Jóhannsson, all of
whom answered an enormous amount of questions (some of them very
silly) about CapTP.</p>
<p>There are more people to thank too (too many to list here), and you
can see some of them in this
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/cap-talk/xWv2-J62g-I">monster thread on the captp mailing list</a>
which started on May 18th (!!!) as I went through my journey of trying
to understand and eventually implement CapTP.
I actually started preparing a few weeks before which really means that
this journey took me about four and a half months to understand and
implement.
As it turns out, CapTP is a surprisingly simple protocol protocol
in its coneptualization once you understand what it's doing (though
implementing it is a bit more complex).
I do hope to try to build a guide for others to understand and
implement on their own systems... but that will probably wait until
Goblins is ported to another language (due to the realative simplicity
of the task due to the language similarities, the current plan is to
port to Guile next).</p>
<p>Anyway.
This is a big deal, a truly exciting moment for goblinkind.
If you're excited yourself, maybe join the
<a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=fossandcrafts">#spritely channel on irc.freenode.net</a>.</p>
<p>OH!
And also, I can't believe I nearly forgot to say this, but if you want
to hear more about Spritely in general (not just Goblins), we just
<a href="https://fossandcrafts.org/episodes/9-what-is-spritely.html">released a Spritely-centric episode of FOSS and Crafts</a>.
Maybe take a listen!</p>

  <p>I spent some time this week digging into Python's sqlite3 internals. I also gave two talks and recorded a third, due to air at PyGotham in October.</p>
 sqlite-dump and datasette-backup 
<p>I'm running an increasing number of Datasette instances with mutable database files - databases that are updated through a variety of different mechanisms. So I need to start thinking about backups.</p>
<p>Prior to this most of my database files had been relatively disposable: they're built from other sources of data (often by scheduled GitHub Actions) so backups weren't necessary since I could always rebuild them from their point of truth.</p>
<p>Creating a straight copy of a SQLite database file isn't enough for robust backups, because the file may be accepting writes while you are creating the copy.</p>
<p>SQLite has various mechanisms for backups. There's an <a href="https://sqlite.org/backup.html">online backup API</a> and more recent SQLite versions support a <a href="https://sqlite.org/lang_vacuum.html#vacuuminto">VACUUM INTO</a> command which also optimizes the backed up database.</p>
<p>I figured it would be useful to expose this functionality by a Datasette plugin - one that could allow automated backups to be directly fetched from Datasette over HTTPS. So I started work on <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-backup">datasette-backup</a>.</p>
<p>For the first backup mode, I decided to take advantage of the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.Connection.iterdump">connection.iterdump()</a> method that's built into Python's sqlite3 module. This method is an iterator that outputs plain text SQL that can recreate a database. Crucially it's a streaming-compatible mechanism - unlike <code>VACUUM INTO</code> which would require me to create a temporary file the same as the database I was backing up.</p>
<p>I started experimenting with it, and ran into <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-backup/issues/5">a big problem</a>. I make extensive use of SQLite full-text search, but the <code>.sql</code> dumps generated by <code>.iterdump()</code> break with constraint errors if they include any FTS tables.</p>
<p>After a bit of digging I came across <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blame/v3.8.5/Lib/sqlite3/dump.py#L38-L45">a 13 year old comment about this</a> in the cPython source code itself!</p>
<p>The implementation for <code>.iterdump()</code> turns out to be entirely in Python, and way less complicated than I had expected. So I decided to see if I could get FTS table exports working.</p>
<p>In a classic case of yak shaving, I decided to create a Python library called <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-dump">sqlite-dump</a> to solve this problem. And since my existing cookiecutter templates only cover <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-plugin">Datasette Plugins</a> or <a href="https://github.com/simonw/click-app">Click apps</a> I first needed to create a new <a href="https://github.com/simonw/python-lib">python-lib</a> template in order to create the library I needed for my plugin.</p>
<p>I got it working! Install the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-backup">datasette-backup</a> plugin on any Datasette instance to get a <code>/-/backup/name-of-database.sql</code> URL that will produce a streaming SQL dump of any attached database.</p>
 A weird bug with SQLite FTS and triggers 
<p>While working on <code>datasette-backup</code> I noticed a weird issue with some of my SQLite full-text search enabled databases: they kept getting bigger. Way bigger than I would expect them to.</p>
<p>I eventually noticed that the <code>licenses_fts</code> table in my <a href="https://github-to-sqlite.dogsheep.net/">github-to-sqlite demo database</a> had 7 rows in it, but the accompanying <code>licenses_fts_docsize</code> table had 9,141. I would expect it to only have 7 as well.</p>
<p>I was stumped as to what was going on, so I <a href="https://sqlite.org/forum/forumpost/e05a261524">turned to the official SQLite forum</a>. I only recently discovered how useful this is as a resource. Dan Kennedy, one of the three core SQLite maintainers, replied within an hour and gave me some useful hints. The root cause turned out to be the way SQLite triggers work: by default, SQLite runs in <code>recursive_triggers=off</code> mode (for backwards compatibility with older databases). This means that an <code>INSERT OR REPLACE</code> update to a table that is backed by full-text search may not correctly trigger the updates needed on the FTS table itself.</p>
<p>Since there doesn't appear to be any disadvantage to running with <code>recursive_triggers=on</code> I've now set that as the default for <code>sqlite-utils</code>, as-of <a href="https://sqlite-utils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v2-17">version 2.17</a>.</p>
<p>I then added a <code>sqlite-utils rebuild-fts data.db</code> command in <a href="https://sqlite-utils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v2-18">version 2.18</a> which can rebuild the FTS tables in a database and fix the <code>_fts_docsize</code> problem.</p>
 Talks 
<p>I presented Build your own data warehouse for personal analytics with SQLite and Datasette at PyCon AU last week. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPQCD3Qxxik">video is here</a> and includes my first public demo of <a href="https://github.com/dogsheep/beta">Dogsheep Beta</a>, my new combined search engine for personal analytics data imported using my <a href="https://dogsheep.github.io/">Dogsheep</a> family of tools. I took questions in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q0sH954Iv83sctmB_sfHJg2zZMYZGhY_n2s38yOCpOU/edit#heading=h.b1b8d2228j9">this Google Doc</a>, and filled out more detailed answers after the talk.</p>
<p>I gave a talk at PyRVA a couple of days called Rapid data analysis with SQLite and Datasette. Here's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5U3RyzxTKtQ">the video</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1clxqE0xCqPw5baFLGKOr29iur1sV9ruMj8MNW-Xlzpo/edit">Google Doc</a> for that one.</p>
<p>I also pre-recorded my talk for PyGotham: <a href="https://2020.pygotham.tv/talks/datasette-an-ecosystem-of-tools-for-working-with-small-data/">Datasette - an ecosystem of tools for working with Small Data</a>. The conference is in the first week of October and I'll be hanging out there during the talk answering questions and chatting about the project, safe from the stress of also having to present it live!</p>

<p>The white mess in the image above is the <a href="https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/7152/">Bobcat Fire</a>, spreading now in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Gabriel_Mountains">San Gabriel Mountains</a>, against which Los Angeles’ suburban sprawl (that’s it, on the right) reaches its limits of advance to the north. It makes no sense to build very far up or into these mountains, for two good reasons. One is fire, which happens often and awfully. The other is that the mountains are geologically new, and falling down almost as fast as they are rising up. At the mouths of valleys emptying into the sprawl are vast empty reservoirs—catch basins—ready to be filled with rocks, soil and mud “downwasting,” as geologists say, from a range as big as the Smokies, twice as high, ready to burn and shed.</p>
<p>Outside of its northern rain forests and snow-capped mountains, California has just two seasons: fire and rain. Right now we’re in the midst of fire season. Rain is called Winter, and it has been dry since the last one. If the Bobcat fire burns down to the edge of Monrovia, or Altadena, or any of the towns at the base of the mountains, heavy winter rains will cause downwasting in a form&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McPhee">John McPhee</a> describes in <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1988/09/26/los-angeles-against-the-mountains-i">Los Angeles Against the Mountains</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The water was now spreading over the street. It descended in heavy sheets. As the young Genofiles and their mother glimpsed it in the all but total darkness, the scene was suddenly illuminated by a blue electrical flash. In the blue light they saw a massive blackness, moving. It was not a landslide, not a mudslide, not a rock avalanche; nor by any means was it the front of a conventional flood. In Jackie’s words, “It was just one big black thing coming at us, rolling, rolling with a lot of water in front of it, pushing the water, this big black thing. It was just one big black hill coming toward us.</p>
<p>In geology, it would be known as a debris flow. Debris flows amass in stream valleys and more or less resemble fresh concrete. They consist of water mixed with a good deal of solid material, most of which is above sand size. Some of it is Chevrolet size. Boulders bigger than cars ride long distances in debris flows. Boulders grouped like fish eggs pour downhill in debris flows. The dark material coming toward the Genofiles was not only full of boulders; it was so full of automobiles it was like bread dough mixed with raisins. On its way down Pine Cone Road, it plucked up cars from driveways and the street. When it crashed into the Genofiles’ house, the shattering of safety glass made terrific explosive sounds. A door burst open. Mud and boulders poured into the hall. We’re going to go, Jackie thought. Oh, my God, what a hell of a way for the four of us to die together.</p></blockquote>
<p>Three rains ago we had debris flows in Montecito, the next zip code over from our home in Santa Barbara. I wrote about it in&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2018/01/15/montecito/">Making sense of what happened to Montecito</a>. The flows, which destroyed much of the town and killed about two dozen people, were caused by heavy rains following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Fire">Thomas Fire</a>, which at 281,893 acres was biggest fire in California history at the time. The&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Fire_(2018)">Camp Fire</a>, a few months later, burned a bit less land but killed 85 people and destroyed more than 18,000 buildings, including whole towns. This year we already have two fires bigger than the Thomas, and at least three more growing fast enough to take the lead. You can see the whole updated list on the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/wildfires-map/">Los Angeles Times California Wildfires Map</a>.</p>
<p>For a good high-altitude picture of what’s going on, I recommend NASA’s&nbsp;<a href="https://firms2.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/map/">FIRMS (Fire Information for Resource Management System)</a>. It’s a highly interactive map that lets you mix input from satellite photographs and fire detection by orbiting&nbsp;<a href="https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/">MODIS</a> and <a href="https://ncc.nesdis.noaa.gov/VIIRS/">VIIRS</a>&nbsp;systems. MODIS is onboard the <a href="https://terra.nasa.gov/">Terra</a> and <a href="https://aqua.nasa.gov/">Aqua</a> satellites; and VIIRS is onboard the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/NPP/main/index.html">Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP)</a> spacecraft. (It’s actually more complicated than that. If you’re interested, dig into those links.) Here’s how the FIRMS map shows the active West Coast fires and the smoke they’re producing:</p>
<p></p>
<p>That’s a lot of cremated forest and wildlife right there.</p>
<p>I just put those two images and a bunch of others up on Flickr,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/albums/72157715920586418">here</a>. Most are of MODIS fire detections superimposed on 3-D Google Earth maps. The main thing I want to get across with these is how large and anomalous these fires are.</p>
<p>True: fire is essential to many of the West’s wild ecosystems. It’s no accident that the California state tree, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequoia_sempervirens">Coast Redwood</a>, grows so tall and lives so long: it’s&nbsp;adapted to fire. (One can also make a case that the state flower, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschscholzia_californica">California Poppy</a>, which thrives amidst fresh rocks and soil, is adapted to earthquakes.) But what’s going on here is something much bigger. Explain it any way you like, including strange luck.</p>
<p>Whatever you conclude, it’s a hell of a show. And vice versa.</p>

   15 rules for blogging, and my current streak 
 Matt Webb is on a 24 week streak of blogging multiple posts a week and shares his rules on how he's doing this. These are really good rules. A rule of thumb that has helped me a lot is to fight back against the temptation to make a post as good as I can before I publish it -  because that way lies a giant drafts folder and no actual published content.

<p>I just got this email today:<br>
</p>
<p>Which tells me, from a sample of one (after another, after another) that Zoom is to video conferencing in 2020 what Microsoft Windows was to personal computing in 1999. Back then one business after another said they would only work with Windows and what was left of DOS: Microsoft’s two operating systems for PCs.</p>
<p>What saved the personal computing world from being absorbed into Microsoft was the Internet—and the Web, running on the Internet. The Internet, based on a profoundly generative protocol, supported all kinds of hardware and software at an infinitude of end points. And the Web, based on an equally generative protocol, manifested on browsers that ran on Mac and Linux computers, as well as Windows ones.</p>
<p>But video conferencing is different. Yes, all the popular video conferencing systems run in apps that work on multiple operating systems, and on the two main mobile device OSes as well. And yes, they are substitutable. You don’t have to use Zoom (unless, in cases like mine, where talking to my doctors requires it). There’s still Skype, Webex, Microsoft Teams, Google Hangouts and the rest.</p>
<p>But all of them have a critical dependency through their&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codec">codecs</a>. Those are the ways they code and decode audio and video.&nbsp;While there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_open-source_codecs">some open source codecs</a>, all the systems I just named use&nbsp;proprietary (patent-based) codecs. The big winner among those is&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Video_Coding">H.264, aka AVC-1</a>, which Wikipedia says “is by far the most commonly used format for the recording, compression, and distribution of video content, used by 91% of video industry developers as of September 2019.” Also,</p>
<blockquote><p>H.264 is perhaps best known as being the most commonly used video encoding format on&nbsp;<a title="Blu-ray Disc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blu-ray_Disc">Blu-ray Discs</a>. It is also widely used by streaming Internet sources, such as videos from&nbsp;<a title="Netflix" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix">Netflix</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Hulu" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu">Hulu</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Prime Video" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Video">Prime Video</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Vimeo" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vimeo">Vimeo</a>,&nbsp;<a title="YouTube" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube">YouTube</a>, and the&nbsp;<a title="ITunes Store" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes_Store">iTunes Store</a>, Web software such as the&nbsp;<a title="Adobe Flash Player" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash_Player">Adobe Flash Player</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Microsoft Silverlight" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Silverlight">Microsoft Silverlight</a>, and also various&nbsp;<a title="HDTV" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDTV">HDTV</a>&nbsp;broadcasts over terrestrial (<a title="Advanced Television Systems Committee standards" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Television_Systems_Committee_standards">ATSC</a>,&nbsp;<a title="ISDB-T" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISDB-T">ISDB-T</a>,&nbsp;<a title="DVB-T" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVB-T">DVB-T</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a title="DVB-T2" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVB-T2">DVB-T2</a>), cable (<a title="DVB-C" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVB-C">DVB-C</a>), and satellite (<a title="DVB-S" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVB-S">DVB-S</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="DVB-S2" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVB-S2">DVB-S2</a>) systems.</p>
<p>H.264 is protected by&nbsp;<a title="Patent" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent">patents</a>&nbsp;owned by various parties. A license covering most (but not all) patents essential to H.264 is administered by a&nbsp;<a title="Patent pool" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_pool">patent pool</a>&nbsp;administered by&nbsp;<a title="MPEG LA" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG_LA">MPEG LA</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Video_Coding#cite_note-9">[9]</a></p>
<p>The commercial use of patented H.264 technologies requires the payment of royalties to MPEG LA and other patent owners. MPEG LA has allowed the free use of H.264 technologies for streaming Internet video that is free to end users, and&nbsp;<a title="Cisco Systems" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_Systems">Cisco Systems</a>&nbsp;pays royalties to MPEG LA on behalf of the users of binaries for its&nbsp;<a title="Open-source software" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">open source</a>&nbsp;H.264 encoder.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generativity">generative</a>, clearly, but <a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/9385626/Zittrain_Generative%20Internet.pdf?sequence=1">not as generative</a> as the Internet and the Web, which are both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_principle">end-to-end</a>&nbsp;by design. .</p>
<p>More importantly, AVC-1 in effect slides the Internet and the Web into the orbit of companies that have taken over what used to be telephony and television, which are now mooshed together. In the Columbia Doctors example, Zoom the new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_telephone_system">PBX</a>. The new classroom is every teacher and kid on her or his own rectangle, “zooming” with each other through the new telephony. The new TV is Netflix, Disney, Comcast, Spectrum, Apple, Amazon and many others, all competing for wedges our Internet access and entertainment budgets.</p>
<p>In this new ecosystem, you are less the producer than you were, or would have been, in the early days of the Net and the Web. You are the end user, the consumer, the audience, the customer. Not the producer, the performer. Sure, you can audition for those roles, and play them on YouTube and TikTok, but those are somebody else’s walled gardens. You operate within them at their grace. You are not truly free.</p>
<p>And maybe none of us ever were, in those early days of the Net and the Web. But it sure seemed that way. And it&nbsp;does seem that we have lost something.</p>
<p>Or maybe just that we are slowly losing it, in the manner of boiling frogs.</p>
<p>Do we have to? I mean, it’s still early.</p>
<p>The digital world is how old? Decades, at most.</p>
<p>And how long will it last? At the very least, more than that. Centuries or millennia, probably.</p>
<p>So there’s hope.</p>
<p>[Later…] For some of that, dig OBS—Open Broadcaster Software’s <a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS Studio</a>:&nbsp;Free and open source software for video recording and live streaming. <a href="https://twitter.com/jgro/status/1303519607236460544">HT</a>: Joel Grossman (<a href="https://twitter.com/jgro/">@jgro</a>).</p>

<p>This past July, we replaced our roof and at the same time updated our <a href="https://altmode.org/2009/06/14/photovoltaic-part-3-results/">solar panels and inverter</a> (I’ll write about the new solar equipment in the near future). I was monitoring the new equipment somewhat more closely than usual, and noticed on one warm August day that the inverter had shut down due to low line voltage. Having home solar generation shut down on a warm day with a high air conditioning load is the opposite of what the utility, <a href="https://www.pge.com">Pacific Gas &amp; Electric</a> (PG&amp;E), should want to happen. In addition to shutting down solar power inverters, low line voltage can be hard on power equipment, such as motors.</p>



<p>At a time when our voltage was particularly low, I opened a low line voltage case with PG&amp;E. This resulted in a call from a field technician that told me several things:</p>



  PG&amp;E has been aware of the voltage regulation problem in my neighborhood for some time  The problem is likely to be due to the older 4-kilovolt service in my part of town. Newer areas have 12-kilovolt service that would be expected to have about 1/9 the voltage drop with an equivalent load.  Another possible cause is the pole transformer that feeds our house and nearby neighbors that the technician told me is overloaded. [Other neighbors that aren’t as close are reporting these problems as well, so they would have to have similarly overloaded transformers.]  Line voltage at my home is supposed to be between 114 and 126 VAC.  



<p>Another technician from PG&amp;E came out a couple of days later to install a voltage monitor on the line. But it occurred to me that I have been collecting data since 2007 from my solar inverter that includes voltage data. A total of about 3.2 million data points. So I thought I’d check to see what I can find out from that.</p>



<p>My data are in a MySQL database that I can query easily. So asked it how many days there have been where the line voltage went below 110 VAC (giving PG&amp;E some margin here) and the solar inverter was fully operating. There were 37 such days, including very brief voltage dips (&lt;10 minutes) up to over 5 hours undervoltage on September 2, 2017. The line voltage that day looked like this:</p>







<p>A more recent representative sample is this:</p>







<p>Part of my concern is that this problem seems to be getting worse. Here is a table of the number days where &lt;110 VAC lasted for more than 10 minutes:</p>



YearDays with<br>UndervoltageUndervoltage<br>Minutes2007002008002009114201000201100201200201300201400201511920161102017141386201800201975612020 (to June 30)2160



<p>And as I mentioned above, the problem seems to occur on particularly hot days (which is when others run their air conditioners; we don’t have air conditioning). Fortunately, the <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/">NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information</a> provide good historical data on high and low temperatures. I was able to download the data for Los Altos and relate it to the days with the outages. Indeed, the days with the most serious voltage problems are very warm (high of 110 on 9/2/2017 and 100 degrees on 6/3/2020 shown above).</p>



<p>Does that mean we’re seeing purely a temperature effect that is happening more often due to global warming? It doesn’t seem likely because there have been very warm days in past years with little voltage drop. Here’s a day with a recorded high temperature of 108 in 2009:</p>







<p>My street, and the <a href="https://losaltosca.gov">City of Los Altos</a> more generally, has seen a lot of extensive home renovations and tear-down/rebuilds the past few years. The section of the street I live on, which has about 50 homes, currently has three homes being completely rebuilt and currently unoccupied. So this is only going to get worse.</p>



<p>The ongoing renovations and rebuilds in Los Altos are all considerably larger than the homes (built in the 1950s) that they replace, and I expect nearly all have air conditioning while the original homes didn’t. This is resulting in a considerably higher electrical load on infrastructure that wasn’t designed for this. While this is mitigated somewhat by the prevalence of solar panels in our area, the City needs to require that PG&amp;E upgrade its infrastructure before issuing new building permits that will exacerbate this problem.</p>

<p>In this tutorial we'll use a Raspberry Pi to build an RTMP server that plays out any video stream it receives over the Raspberry Pi's HDMI port automatically. This effectively turns a Raspberry Pi into a Blackmagic Streaming Bridge.</p>

<p>You can use this to stream from OBS or an ATEM Mini across your local network or the internet, and convert that to an HDMI signal in your studio to mix with other HDMI sources locally.</p>



 Parts 

<p>Here's a list of all the parts you'll need for this.</p>

<p>Of course, you'll need a <a href="https://geni.us/APX4YZa">Raspberry Pi</a>. It doesn't need a ton of RAM, I got one with 4GB but it would probably work fine with 2GB as well. I prefer to buy the parts individually rather than the full kits, but either way is fine. If you get the bare Raspberry Pi you'll need to make sure to get a good quality power supply like <a href="https://geni.us/qDB8E">this one</a>.</p>

<p>I have tested this on a Raspberry Pi 3, and it does work, but there's much more of a delay, so I definitely recommend doing this with a Raspberry Pi 4 instead.</p>

<p>Get a good quality SD card for the Pi. We won't be doing anything super disk intensive, but it will generally perform a lot better with an SD Card with an "A1" or "A2" rating. You don't need much disk space, 16gb, 32gb or 64gb cards are all good options. The "A1" or "A2" ratings mean the card is optimized for running applications rather than storing photos or videos. I like the Sandisk cards, either the <a href="https://geni.us/d3F5G4n">32gb A1</a> or the slightly faster <a href="https://geni.us/LOabG">64gb A2</a>.</p>

<p>You'll need a case for the Pi as well. I like <a href="https://geni.us/yu4Y">this one</a> which is also a giant heat sink so that it's completely silent.</p>

<p>The Raspberry Pi 4 has a Micro HDMI port rather than a full size, so you'll need a cable to plug that in to a regular size HDMI port like <a href="https://geni.us/s3rIb2">this one</a>.</p>

<p>Make sure you have your Raspberry Pi and whatever device you're streaming from connected via a wired network. While this will probably work over wifi, I wouldn't count on wifi to be reliable or fast for this.</p>

 Prepare the Raspberry Pi SD Card 

<p>First, head over to <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/">raspberrypi.org/downloads</a> to download the Raspberry Pi Imager app. This app makes it super easy to create an SD card with the Raspberry Pi OS.</p>

<p></p>

<p>When you choose the operating system to install, select "Other"</p>

<p></p>

<p>then choose "Lite"</p>

<p></p>

<p>We don't need a desktop environment for this so it will be easier to use the command line.</p>

<p>Go ahead and write this to the SD card, then take out the SD card and put it into the Raspberry Pi.</p>

 Configure the OS 

<p>The first time you boot it up it will take a few seconds and then it will prompt you to log in.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Log in using the default username and password. Enter the username "pi", and then type the password "raspberry". You won't see the password as you're typing it.</p>

<p>It's a good idea to change the password to something else, so go ahead and do that now. Type:</p>

 <code>sudo raspi-config
</code> 

<p>and choose the first option in the menu by pressing "Enter". When you type the new password, you won't see it on the screen, but it will ask you to type it twice to confirm. Press "tab" twice to select "Finish" to close out of this menu.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next we need to configure the video mode so we know what kind of signal the Raspberry Pi will be sending on the HDMI port. You'll need to edit a text file to make these changes.</p>

 <code>sudo nano /boot/config.txt
</code> 

<p>This will launch a text editor to edit this file. We need to change the following things in the file. These may be commented out with a <code>#</code> so you can delete that character to uncomment the line and make the necessary changes. These options are documented <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/config-txt/video.md">here</a>.</p>

 <code># Make sure the image fits the whole screen
disable_overscan=1

# Set HDMI output mode to Consumer Electronics Association mode
hdmi_group=1

# Enable audio over HDMI
hdmi_drive=2

# Set the output resolution and frame rate to your desired option

# 1920x1080 60fps
hdmi_mode=16 

# 1920x1080 25fps
hdmi_mode=33

# 1920x1080 30fps
hdmi_mode=34
</code> 

<p>To save your changes, press Ctrl+X and then "Y" to confirm, then "Enter". At this point we need to reboot to make the changes take effect, so type:</p>

 <code>sudo reboot
</code> 

<p>and wait a few seconds for it to reboot.</p>

 Install and Configure Software 

<p>We'll be using nginx with the RTMP module as the RTMP server, and then connect omxplayer to play out the stream over the HDMI port.</p>

<p>Install the necessary software by typing:</p>

 <code>sudo apt update
sudo apt install omxplayer nginx libnginx-mod-rtmp
</code> 

<p>We need to give nginx permission to use the video port, so do that with the following command:</p>

 <code>sudo usermod -aG video www-data
</code> 

<p>Now we need to set up an RTMP server in nginx. Edit the main nginx config file:</p>

 <code>sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
</code> 

<p>Scroll all the way to the bottom and copy the below text into the config file:</p>

 <code>rtmp {
  server {
    listen 1935;

    application live {
      # Enable livestreaming
      live on;

      # Disable recording
      record off;

      # Allow only this machine to play back the stream
      allow play 127.0.0.1;
      deny play all;

      # Start omxplayer and play the stream out over HDMI
      exec omxplayer -o hdmi rtmp://127.0.0.1:1935/live/$name;
    }
  }
}
</code> 

<p>The magic sauce here is the <code>exec</code> line that starts omxplayer. omxplayer is an application that can play an RTMP stream out over the Raspberry Pi's HDMI port. The <code>exec</code> line will run this command whenever a new RTMP stream is received. The stream key will be set to the <code>$name</code> variable. Note that this means any stream key will work, there is no access control the way we have it configured here. You can read up on the <a href="https://github.com/arut/nginx-rtmp-module/wiki/Directives">RTMP module</a> if you'd like to learn how to lock down access to only specific stream keys or if you want to enable recording the stream.</p>

<p>Save this file by pressing ctrl+X, then Y, then enter.</p>

<p>To test the config file for errors, type:</p>

 <code>sudo nginx -t
</code> 

<p>If that worked, you can reload nginx to make your changes take effect:</p>

 <code>sudo nginx -s reload
</code> 

<p>At this point the Raspberry Pi is ready! You can now stream to this box and it will output the received stream over HDMI! Any stream key will work, and you can stream using any sort of device or software like OBS. You'll need to find the IP address of the Raspberry Pi which you can do by typing</p>

 <code>hostname -I
</code> 

<p>To stream to the Raspberry Pi, use the RTMP URL: <code>rtmp://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS/live</code> and anything as the stream key.</p>

 Setting up the ATEM Mini 

<p>We'll now walk through setting up an ATEM Mini Pro to stream to the Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>If you're familiar with customizing your ATEM Software's <code>Streaming.xml</code> file, you can add a new entry with the Raspberry Pi's IP address. But there is another way which I like better, which is to create a custom streaming file that you can send to a remote guest and they can add it in their Software Control app without needing to edit any XML.</p>

<p>Create a new XML file with the following contents. This is the contents of one of the <code>&lt;service&gt;</code> blocks from the <code>Streaming.xml</code> file, wrapped with a <code>&lt;streaming&gt;</code> element.</p>

 <code>&lt;streaming&gt;
    &lt;service&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;Raspberry Pi&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;servers&gt;
            &lt;server&gt;
                &lt;name&gt;Primary&lt;/name&gt;
                &lt;url&gt;rtmp://RASPBERRY_PI_IP/live&lt;/url&gt;
            &lt;/server&gt;
        &lt;/servers&gt;
        &lt;profiles&gt;
            &lt;profile&gt;
                &lt;name&gt;Streaming High&lt;/name&gt;
                &lt;config resolution="1080p" fps="60"&gt;
                    &lt;bitrate&gt;9000000&lt;/bitrate&gt;
                    &lt;audio-bitrate&gt;128000&lt;/audio-bitrate&gt;
                    &lt;keyframe-interval&gt;2&lt;/keyframe-interval&gt;
                &lt;/config&gt;
                &lt;config resolution="1080p" fps="30"&gt;
                    &lt;bitrate&gt;6000000&lt;/bitrate&gt;
                    &lt;audio-bitrate&gt;128000&lt;/audio-bitrate&gt;
                    &lt;keyframe-interval&gt;2&lt;/keyframe-interval&gt;
                &lt;/config&gt;
            &lt;/profile&gt;
            &lt;profile&gt;
                &lt;name&gt;Streaming Low&lt;/name&gt;
                &lt;config resolution="1080p" fps="60"&gt;
                    &lt;bitrate&gt;4500000&lt;/bitrate&gt;
                    &lt;audio-bitrate&gt;128000&lt;/audio-bitrate&gt;
                    &lt;keyframe-interval&gt;2&lt;/keyframe-interval&gt;
                &lt;/config&gt;
                &lt;config resolution="1080p" fps="30"&gt;
                    &lt;bitrate&gt;3000000&lt;/bitrate&gt;
                    &lt;audio-bitrate&gt;128000&lt;/audio-bitrate&gt;
                    &lt;keyframe-interval&gt;2&lt;/keyframe-interval&gt;
                &lt;/config&gt;
            &lt;/profile&gt;
        &lt;/profiles&gt;
    &lt;/service&gt;      
&lt;/streaming&gt;
</code> 

<p>Replace the IP address with your own, and you can customize the <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> as well which will show up in the ATEM Software Control. Save this file with an <code>.xml</code> extension.</p>

<p>In the ATEM Software Control app, click "Stream" from the menu bar, choose "Load Streaming Settings", and select the XML file you created.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This will create a new option in the "Live Stream" section where you can stream to the Raspberry Pi instead of YouTube!</p>

<p></p>

<p>Go ahead and enter a streaming key now, it doesn't matter what you enter since there is no access control on the Raspberry Pi. Click "On Air" and in a few seconds you should see the image pop up on the Raspberry Pi!</p>

<p></p><p>Happy Labor Day. While the rest of the world celebrates its labor movements on May Day, America chose its date <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/01/opinion/kohn-labor-day/index.html">to disassociate with a massacre of labor protesters by police</a> in 1886. A further protest in Chicago's Haymarket Square devolved two days later: a bomb was exploded by an unknown person and killed a police officer, and the cops again indiscriminately opened fire. Ultimately, socialists were blamed, as they always are, and the country succumbed to martial law.</p><p>The one country to have not chosen May Day to commemorate what became known as the Haymarket Affair is the one it happened in. The reason we drink beer and eat summer picnic food on Labor Day instead of considering its meaning is not an accident: it was a deliberate choice to bury the past and redirect our energy towards a holiday that celebrates "the dignity of work".</p><p>What insane, radical, unworkable idea were the protesters taking to the streets to advocate? <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/views/2020/05/01/may-day-2020-worker-unity-age-pandemic">It turns out it was the eight hour workday</a> - something we think of as more or less normal today. In the cold light of 2020, it's hard to imagine guns being drawn over a 40-hour workweek.</p><p>Of course, that's how it works: what seemed radical then is normal now. What seems radical now will be completely normal in the future. While Labor Day itself is less a celebration of the labor movement and more a commemoration of an attempt to diffuse it, history shows that it tends to resist that diffusion. The march towards equality is not inevitable, but it has been unstoppable.</p><p>Unions are an important part of that struggle: a counter-balancing force to corporate power that allows workers to organize together and meaningfully negotiate for better working conditions. While not every union is good, the idea of unions is very good. <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/318980/approval-labor-unions-remains-high.aspx">65% of Americans continue to support unions</a>, but <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/265958/percentage-workers-union-members.aspx">only 10% are actually a member of one</a>. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/union-decline-lowers-wages-of-nonunion-workers-the-overlooked-reason-why-wages-are-stuck-and-inequality-is-growing/">the stagnation of worker wages is directly connected to the decline of unions</a>.</p><p>I have no doubt that unions have been intentionally scuppered since at least 1974, when <a href="https://psmag.com/economics/what-caused-the-decline-of-unions-in-america">the Taft-Hartley Act banned sympathy boycotts and made "right to work" laws possible</a>. But they've also been in need of the kind of change and innovation we've seen in other organizations over the last few decades. What does it mean to have a union for a remote workforce? Or for gig workers? And how does the idea of a union change when everyone is connected by the internet and can communicate instantly with one another?</p><p>Kati Sipp's excellent site <a href="http://www.hacktheunion.org/">Hack the Union</a> has been expertly covering these kinds of changes for years. I think it's also time for technologists - particularly open source and decentralization advocates - to think about how their skills could be brought to bear in order to create new kinds of transparent unions.</p><p>Movements like Occupy Wall Street and modern anti-fascists use a headless, non-hierarchical leadership structure rooted in transparency and consensus, making them harder to infiltrate or eradicate. What if unions learned from them and used tools inspired by <a href="https://opencollective.com/">Open Collective</a> to organize dues in the open?</p><p><a href="https://blockchainhub.net/dao-decentralized-autonomous-organization/">Decentralized Autonomous Organizations</a> (DAOs) were created to take this leaderless approach and apply it to new kinds of businesses. Here, a blockchain is used to keep track of "who" is a member (using pseudonymous tokens instead of real-world identities), who can vote, and items put to a vote. Resources can be allocated based on what the organization decides. Instead of leaders, rules are maintained by code.</p><p>While DAOs were built to support a kind of libertarian ideal for business, what if they could be harnessed to support modern unions? The privacy and anonymity of individual members could be maintained while allowing any member to vote. Available resources could be inspected by anybody. There would be little potential for embezzlement and corruption, because of the unbreakable rules governing resource allocation, and membership could be spread organically.</p><p>I'm not a blockchain zealot, and there's no hard need for a potential solution for unions to be decentralized in this way. (Crypto-unions are just one suggestion.) What I think is needed is a conversation about how best to organize in the 21st century, so that the labor movement can continue its good work, so that worker rights can improve, and wages can break free of their stagnation. What's needed is a stronger opposite force to corporate power that allows ordinary working people to once again have a voice. The result will be to break more people out of poverty and create a more equal society for all.</p><p>In the meantime, enjoy your lobster rolls.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Photo from <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/kheelcenter/5278847529">the Kheel Center archive</a>.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

  <p>This week I figured out how to populate Datasette from Airtable, wrote code to generate social media preview card page screenshots using Puppeteer, and made a big breakthrough with my Dogsheep project.</p>
 airtable-export 
<p>I wrote about <a href="https://www.rockybeaches.com/">Rocky Beaches</a> in my weeknotes <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Aug/21/weeknotes-rocky-beaches/">two weeks ago</a>. It's a new website built by Natalie Downe that showcases great places to go rockpooling (tidepooling in American English), mixing in tide data from NOAA and species sighting data from iNaturalist.</p>
<p>Rocky Beaches is powered by Datasette, using a GitHub Actions workflow that builds the site's underlying SQLite database using API calls and YAML data stored in the GitHub repository.</p>
<p>Natalie wanted to use Airtable to maintain the structured data for the site, rather than hand-editing a YAML file. So I built <a href="https://github.com/simonw/airtable-export">airtable-export</a>, a command-line script for sucking down all of the data from an Airtable instance and writing it to disk as YAML or JSON.</p>
<p>You run it like this:</p>
 <code>airtable-export out/ mybaseid table1 table2 --key=key
</code> 
<p>This will create a folder called <code>out/</code> with a <code>.yml</code> file for each of the tables.</p>
<p>Sadly the Airtable API doesn't yet provide a mechanism to list all of the tables in a database (a <a href="https://community.airtable.com/t/list-tables-given-api-key-and-baseid/1173">long-running feature request</a>) so you have to list the tables yourself.</p>
<p>We're now <a href="https://github.com/natbat/rockybeaches/blob/32a010292e7c1ba47db1a86523a61c666d977074/.github/workflows/deploy.yml#L31-L44">running that command</a> as part of the Rocky Beaches build script, and committing the latest version of the YAML file back to the GitHub repo (thus gaining a <a href="https://github.com/natbat/rockybeaches/commits/main/airtable">full change history</a> for that data).</p>
 Social media cards for my TILs 
<p>I really like social media cards - <code>og:image</code> HTML meta attributes for Facebook and <code>twitter:image</code> for Twitter. I wanted them for articles on my <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/">TIL website</a> since I often share those via Twitter.</p>
<p>One catch: my TILs aren't very image heavy. So I decided to generate screenshots of the pages and use those as the 2x1 social media card images.</p>
<p>The best way I know of programatically generating screenshots is to use <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/puppeteer">Puppeteer</a>, a Node.js library for automating a headless instance of the Chrome browser that is maintained by the Chrome DevTools team.</p>
<p>My first attempt was to run Puppeteer in an AWS Lambda function on <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>. I remembered seeing an example of how to do this in the Vercel documentation a few years ago. The example isn't there any more, but I found the <a href="https://github.com/vercel/now-examples/pull/207">original pull request</a> that introduced it.</p>
<p>Since the example was MIT licensed I created my own fork at <a href="https://github.com/simonw/puppeteer-screenshot">simonw/puppeteer-screenshot</a> and updated it to work with the latest Chrome.</p>
<p>It's pretty resource intensive, so I also added a secret <code>?key=</code> mechanism so only my own automation code could call my instance running on Vercel.</p>
<p>I needed to store the generated screenshots somewhere. They're pretty small - on the order of 60KB each - so I decided to store them in my SQLite database itself and use my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-media">datasette-media</a> plugin (see <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Jul/30/fun-binary-data-and-sqlite/">Fun with binary data and SQLite</a>) to serve them up.</p>
<p>This worked! Until it didn't... I ran into a showstopper bug when I realized that the screenshot process relies on the page being live on the site... but when a new article is added it's not live when the build process works, so the generated screenshot <a href="https://github.com/simonw/til/issues/23">is of the 404 page</a>.</p>
<p>So I reworked it to generate the screenshots inside the GitHub Action as part of the build script, using <a href="https://github.com/JarvusInnovations/puppeteer-cli">puppeteer-cli</a>.</p>
<p>My <a href="https://github.com/simonw/til/blob/3fca996228ad54ee433b25840fcd3682e9f7bbfd/generate_screenshots.py">generate_screenshots.py</a> script handles this, by first shelling out to <code>datasette --get</code> to render the HTML for the page, then running <code>puppeteer</code> to generate the screenshot. Relevant code:</p>
 def png_for_path(path):
    # Path is e.g. /til/til/python_debug-click-with-pdb.md
    page_html = str(TMP_PATH / "generate-screenshots-page.html")
    # Use datasette to generate HTML
    proc = subprocess.run(["datasette", ".", "--get", path], capture_output=True)
    open(page_html, "wb").write(proc.stdout)
    # Now use puppeteer screenshot to generate a PNG
    proc2 = subprocess.run(
        [
            "puppeteer",
            "screenshot",
            page_html,
            "--viewport",
            "800x400",
            "--full-page=false",
        ],
        capture_output=True,
    )
    png_bytes = proc2.stdout
    return png_bytes 
<p>This worked great! Except for one thing... the site is hosted on Vercel, and Vercel has a 5MB <a href="https://vercel.com/docs/platform/limits#serverless-function-payload-size-limit">response size limit</a>.</p>
<p>Every time my GitHub build script runs it downloads the previous SQLite database file, so it can avoid regenerating screenshots and HTML for pages that haven't changed.</p>
<p>The addition of the binary screenshots drove the size of the SQLite database over 5MB, so the part of my script that retrieved the previous database <a href="https://github.com/simonw/til/issues/25">no longer worked</a>.</p>
<p>I needed a reliable way to store that 5MB (and probably eventually 10-50MB) database file in between runs of my action.</p>
<p>The best place to put this would be an S3 bucket, but I ind the process of setting up IAM permissions for access to a new bucket so infuriating that I couldn't bring myself to do it.</p>
<p>So... I created a new dedicated GitHub repository, <a href="https://github.com/simonw/til-db">simonw/til-db</a>, and updated my action to store the binary file in that repo - using <a href="https://github.com/simonw/til/blob/1e29c3fe5e90c29b0e71d87dba805484ceb4393c/.github/workflows/build.yml#L80-L86">a force push</a> so the repo doesn't need to maintain unnecessary version history of the binary asset.</p>
<p>This is an abomination of a hack, and it made me cackle a lot. I <a href="https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1301029346614718465">tweeted about it</a> and got the suggestion to try <a href="https://git-lfs.github.com/">Git LFS</a> instead, which would definitely be a more appropriate way to solve this problem.</p>
 Rendering Markdown 
<p>I write my blog entries in Markdown and transform them into HTML before I post them on my blog. Some day I'll teach my blog to render Markdown itself, but so far I've got by through copying and pasting into Markdown tools.</p>
<p>My favourite Markdown flavour is GitHub's, which adds a bunch of useful capabilities - most notably the ability to apply syntax highlighting. GitHub <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/markdown">expose an API</a> that applies their Markdown formatter and returns the resulting HTML.</p>
<p>I built myself <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/tools/render-markdown">a quick and scrappy tool</a> in JavaScript that sends Markdown through their API and then applies a few DOM manipulations to clean up what comes back. It was a nice opportunity to write some modern vanilla JavaScript using <code>fetch()</code>:</p>
  async function render(markdown) {
    return (await fetch('https://api.github.com/markdown', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({'mode': 'markdown', 'text': markdown})
    })).text();
}

const button = document.getElementsByTagName('button')[0];
const output = document.getElementById('output');
const preview = document.getElementById('preview');

button.addEventListener('click', async function() {
    const rendered = await render(input.value);
    output.value = rendered;
    preview.innerHTML = rendered;
});  
 Dogsheep Beta 
<p>My most exciting project this week was getting out the first working version of <a href="https://github.com/dogsheep/beta">Dogsheep Beta</a> - the search engine that ties together results from my <a href="https://dogsheep.github.io/">Dogsheep</a> family of tools for personal analytics.</p>
<p>I'm giving a talk about this tonight at PyCon Australia: <a href="https://2020.pycon.org.au/program/73uk8x/">Build your own data warehouse for personal analytics with SQLite and Datasette</a>. I'll be writing up detailed notes in the next few days, so watch this space.</p>

<p>I've noticed more blog posts on my feeds talking about mental health, and more tweets talking about anxiety in the face of this year's challenges. I'm certainly feeling it too. This week I've been building a contingency plan for what happens if I have to take a leave of absence from work because of my mother's health, which has been an emotionally difficult task on top of an already emotionally challenging context.</p><p>2020 as a whole is a collective trauma. The thing about serious trauma is that it ripples. Its effects are felt in the lives of the people who lived through it; not just as they live through it, but forever. And then it's felt in their children. And finally, in their children.</p><p>My father is one of the youngest survivors of the Japanese concentration camps in Indonesia. He and his older siblings were kept alive by my grandmother. As a 12 year old, my aunt snuck out of the camp and swam through the sewers to find food for them to eat. My grandmother would gather snails and secretly cook them. Around them all - my grandmother, my aunts, my toddler father - was death and brutality. People in the camp were routinely tortured and murdered.</p><p>My grandmother wailed in her sleep every night until the day she died. The trauma certainly affected her children; my father has suffered from its effects in ways that he only became consciously aware of later in life. In turn, his anxieties affected his children - partially through the effect of his actions, but there is also significant evidence that <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/07/parents-emotional-trauma-may-change-their-children-s-biology-studies-mice-show-how">trauma can be passed down epigenetically</a>. My dad is both younger than most of his siblings and had children later in life, but I've seen the effects of this trauma spread to the fourth and fifth generations in my aunts' branches of the family.</p><p>The implications for families that have been split up through draconian immigration policies, or suffered at the hands of trigger-happy police, or been caught by a racist criminal justice system are obvious. The trauma of poverty, too, <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/poverty-linked-to-epigenetic-changes-and-mental-illness-1.19972">creates epigenetic changes that span generations</a>. But during this terrible year, more of us than ever before have seen our relatives die or had our homes destroyed at the hands of natural disasters. We've lived under a kind of fear we thought was a thing of the past.</p><p>So, no wonder we're all feeling kind of terrible. The thing is, it won't just be for the moment. The impact of 2020 - and, yes, I'm afraid to say, 2021 too - is likely to be with many of us for the rest of our lives. If we're not careful, it'll be with our children, too, and their children.</p><p>The good news is that these traumatic effects can be reversed. <a href="https://www.icaad.com/blog/shadows-of-the-past-epigenetics-and-patterns-of-inherited-trauma">Exercise, intense learning, and anti-depressants can help</a>. But that implies that we'll all need systemic help: mental wellness support and a far stronger social safety net. Without this support, the hidden effects of the pandemic (and everything else that's happened this year) may be with us for a very long time to come.</p>

<p>Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) over the time has become a bit of an overloaded term. There are multiple articles, blogs, analyst reports explaining what CIAM is and defining it in different ways. The objective of this blog is to provide my perspective of CIAM in one-line definition.</p><p>Before defining what it is, let’s be clear on why we need to worry about&nbsp;CIAM.</p> Why CIAM? <p>Transforming the customer experience is at the heart of digital transformation. Digital technologies are changing the game of customer interactions, with new rules and possibilities that were unimaginable only a few years back. CIAM is a whole emerging area in the IAM, which is essentially an ingredient for digital customer experience.</p><p>The rest of the blog is based on the above statement. I believe that’s fair enough, and haven’t seen that been questioned much. We can safely assume that’s a well-accepted definition of the objective of CIAM. It might not be in the same words, but still, many who talk about CIAM, share a similar/closer view.</p> Gartner Definition <p>In one of it’s reports Gartner defines CIAM in a lighter way&nbsp;as,</p><p>In my view it’s not strong enough and does not carry enough depth to reach the objective of CIAM. CIAM is more than managing customer identities in a traditional way. It needs to be the facilitator to leverage identity data to catalyze business&nbsp;growth.</p> More CIAM Definitions <p>If you Google, you can find more definitions of CIAM. Not that all of them are wrong, but none of them IMO put enough weight on the objective of CIAM. Here I list few of them. Then again, these are different view points, and none of them are wrong or&nbsp;bad.</p> Customer-focused IAM <p>Rather calling CIAM, managing customer identities, I would like to call it customer-focused IAM. IAM is a well-defined term. As per&nbsp;Gartner,</p><p>The customer-focused IAM adds a lot of depth into the definition of IAM. For example, unlike traditional IAM, when you focus on customers, you probably start working with millions of impatient users, who get annoyed by filling lengthy forms, and cannot wait at least 2 seconds to log into a system. Even a small glitch in your system, they will take it to the social media and will make a big buzz. The slightest of leaked customer information could take a big slice of your share price&nbsp;down.</p><p>Yahoo!, for example, was in the middle of a series of data breaches a few years back, that exposed the PII data of more than 1 billion users. That did cost the company $350 million. They had to lower the sales price of its email and other digital services, which they sold to Verizon from $4.83 billion to $4.48 billion to account for the potential backlash from the data breaches.</p> Beyond Customer-focused IAM <p>Calling CIAM, the customer-focused IAM, still does not add enough weight on the emphasis that it should catalyze business growth. Unlike traditional IAM, a CIAM system should have the capability to integrate with customer relationship management (CRM) systems, marketing platforms, e-commerce platforms, content management systems (CMS), data management platforms and many more. A customer-focused IAM system, with no business integrations adds little value in terms of the business growth that we expect from having a CIAM solution.</p> What CIAM&nbsp;is? <p>Customer-focused IAM does not necessarily mean you only manage customer identities. That’s why I preferred customer-focused IAM instead of managing customer identities. In a typical CIAM solution in addition to direct customers, you also need to manage identities of employees who have direct access to the CIAM solution, or should integrate with an IAM system that manages employee identities. The latter is the preferred option. Also, not all the CIAM solutions are just B2C (business-to-consumer), it can also be B2B (business-to-business) or B2B2C (business-to-business-consumer) as&nbsp;well.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com/what-is-customer-iam-ciam-9f3d74c9632a">What is Customer IAM (CIAM)?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com">FACILELOGIN</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>I always work across multiple machines and operating systems. I wrote up my <a href="https://blog.bmannconsulting.com/laptop-choices/">laptop choices</a> back in Feb 2020, and I ended up dipping my toes back into Windows with a laptop. Before that, I had bought two Chromebooks in a row, and I still think they are some of the best value.</p>

<p>Ryan recently asked me a question about Chromebooks:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’m thinking of getting my 12 year old a Chromebook for back to school and wanted your input. For context, most of what they’ll be doing is google docs driven and she’s not a gamer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, the Chromebooks are solid. And now that you can put Linux on them as a built in feature, there’s lots more that can be done with it.</p>

<p>You can also game on it: with streaming services like Stadia or Geforce Now, or Steam and some Linux games.</p>

<p>I usually follow the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-chromebook/">Wirecutter recommendations</a> – I have personal experience with buying two ASUS Chromebooks and have been very impressed.</p>

<p>Looks like the <a href="https://www.londondrugs.com/asus-chromebook-flip-c434---touchscreen---14-inch---intel-m3---c434ta-dsm4t/L0568795.html">ASUS Flip C434 is available at London Drugs for $700CAD</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Lenovo-Chromebook-i3-10110U-Processor-82B80006UX/dp/B086383HC7">Lenovo model that is current WireCutter top rating</a> looks to be good and available for about $560CAD.</p>

<p>If you see Chromebooks for less than $500CAD – they are usually way too underpowered.</p>

 

<p>And then Greg emailed me, so I’m turning this whole thing into a little Chromebook FAQ:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We’re wanting/needing to get something for my kids to use for school, and since they use the GSuite at school a Chromebook seems like a good idea. However, they still want to be able to play Minecraft.</p>

<p>Is there a site you would recommend for me to go to, in order to figure out what Chromebook to order? What Chromebook are you running?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Today, you don’t need to “dual boot” into Linux any more. Like WSL for Windows, you run any flavour of Linux that you want and you can run graphical apps like Minecraft no problem. <a href="https://beebom.com/how-install-play-minecraft-chromebook/">This site on installing Minecraft for Chromebooks</a> has too many ads on it, but basically – Linux stuff installs directly on Chromebooks these days.</p>

<p>Having a really solid browser environment, plus basic apps you can install, makes for a good stable system that is very inexpensive for what you get. You need to pay more for a Windows or Mac laptop – approximately 2-4 times the price of a solid Chromebook – to get equivalent performance.</p>

<p>My current Chromebook is the <a href="https://www.asus.com/us/Commercial-Laptops/ASUS-Chromebook-Flip-C434TA/Tech-Specs/">ASUS C434</a>, but as I said at the top, I’m also switching between an ASUS Windows laptop and a Mac desktop.</p>

<p>I still wouldn’t pay more than $1000CAD for a Chromebook (and even that is pretty high).</p>

   I've identified a pattern for handling potentially-asynchronous callback functions in Python which I'm calling the "await me maybe" pattern. It works by letting you return a value, a callable function that returns a value OR an awaitable function that returns that value.

 Datasette has been built on top of Python 3 asyncio from the very start - initiall using Sanic, and as-of Dataset

  <p>I've identified a pattern for handling potentially-asynchronous callback functions in Python which I'm calling the "await me maybe" pattern. It works by letting you return a value, a callable function that returns a value OR an awaitable function that returns that value.</p>
 Background 
<p><a href="https://docs.datasette.io/">Datasette</a> has been built on top of Python 3 <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html">asyncio</a> from the very start - initiall using <a href="https://sanic.readthedocs.io/">Sanic</a>, and as-of <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-29">Datasette 0.29</a> using a custom mini-framework on top of ASGI 3, usually running under Uvicorn.</p>
<p>Datasette also has a plugin system, built on top of <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pluggy/">Pluggy</a>.</p>
<p>Pluggy is a beautifully designed mechanism for plugins. It works based on decorated functions, which are called at various points by Datasette itself.</p>
<p>A simple plugin that injects a new JavaScript file into a page coud look like this:</p>

 from datasette import hookimpl

@hookimpl
def extra_js_urls():
    return [
        "https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.min.js"
    ] 
<p>Datasette can then gather together all of the extra JavaScript URLs that should be injected into a page by running this code:</p>

 urls = []
for url in pm.hook.extra_js_urls(
    template=template.name,
    datasette=datasette,
):
    urls.extend(url) 
<p>What's up with the <code>template=</code> and <code>datasette=</code> parameters that are passed here?</p>
<p>Pluggy implements a form of dependency injection, where plugin hook functions can optionally list additional parameters that they would like to have access to.</p>
<p>The above simple example didn't need any extra information. But imagine a plugin that only wants to inject jQuery on the <code>table.html</code> template page:</p>

 @hookimpl
def extra_js_urls(template):
    if template == "table.html":
        return [
            "https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.min.js"
        ] 
<p>Datasette actually provides several more optional argument for these plugin functions - see <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/plugin_hooks.html#extra-template-vars-template-database-table-columns-view-name-request-datasette">the plugin hooks documentation</a> for full details.</p>
 What if we need to await something? 
<p>The <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/internals.html#datasette-class">datasette object</a> that can be passed to plugin hooks is special: it provides an object that can be used for the following:</p>
 
 Executing SQL against databases connected to Datasette 
 Looking up Datasette metadata and configuration settings, including plugin configuration 
 Rendering templates using the template environment configured by Datasette 
 Performing checks against the Datasette <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/authentication.html#permissions">permissions system</a> 
 
<p>Here's the problem: many of those methods on Datasette are awaitable - <code>await datasette.render_template(...)</code> for example. But Pluggy is built around regular non-awaitable Python functions.</p>
<p>If my <code>def extra_js_urls()</code> plugin function needs to execute a SQL query to decide what JavaScript to include, it won't be able to - because you can't use <code>await</code> inside a regular Python function.</p>
<p>That's where the "await me maybe" pattern comes in.</p>
<p>The basic idea is that a function can return a value, OR a function-that-returns-a-value, OR an awaitable-function-that-returns-a-value.</p>
<p>If we want our <code>extra_js_urls(datasette)</code> hook to execute a SQL query in order to decide what URLs to return, it can look like this:</p>

 @hookimpl
def extra_js_urls(datasette):
    async def inner():
        db = datasette.get_database()
        results = await db.execute("select url from js_files")
        return [r[0] for r in results]

    return inner 
<p>Note that Python lets you define an <code>async def inner()</code> function inside the body of a regular function, which is what we're doing here.</p>
<p>The code that calls the plugin hook in Datasette can then look like this:</p>

 urls = []
for url in pm.hook.extra_js_urls(
    template=template.name,
    datasette=datasette,
):
    if callable(url):
        url = url()
    if asyncio.iscoroutine(url):
        url = await url
    urls.append(url) 
<p>I use this pattern in a bunch of different places in Datasette, so today I refactored that into <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/blob/26b2922f177caa4e147aaee28be0cff37a457802/datasette/utils/__init__.py#L55-L60">a utility function</a>:</p>

 import asyncio

async def await_me_maybe(value):
    if callable(value):
        value = value()
    if asyncio.iscoroutine(value):
        value = await value
    return value 
<p><a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/commit/26b2922f177caa4e147aaee28be0cff37a457802">This commit</a> includes a bunch of examples where this function is called, for example <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/blob/26b2922f177caa4e147aaee28be0cff37a457802/datasette/app.py#L702-L714">this code</a> which gathers extra body scripts to be included at the bottom of the page:</p>

 body_scripts = []
for extra_script in pm.hook.extra_body_script(
    template=template.name,
    database=context.get("database"),
    table=context.get("table"),
    columns=context.get("columns"),
    view_name=view_name,
    request=request,
    datasette=self,
):
    extra_script = await await_me_maybe(extra_script)
    body_scripts.append(Markup(extra_script))

Just like the product, all these connectors too, are released under the open source Apache 2.0&nbsp;license.</p><p>Identity Server supports passwordless authentication with FIDO 2.0 — and mobile push based authentication with Duo and mePin. Also, we have partnered with Veridium and Aware biometrics to support biometric authentication. In addition to that Identity Server also supports RSA SecurID, TOTP, which you can use with the Google Authenticator mobile app, and then OTP over SMS and&nbsp;Email.</p><p>During a login flow, you can orchestrate between these authenticators by writing an adaptive authentication script in JavaScript. With that you can define how you want to authenticate a user based on environmental attributes (e.g: any HTTP header, geo-location), user attributes / roles (e.g: admins always log with MFA), user behaviors (e.g.: number of failed login attempts, geo-velocity), a risk score and&nbsp;more.</p><p>In the above video, I discuss a set of use cases and show you how you can apply adaptive authentication policies to address advanced authentication requirements.

    Simply put, if you’re in a position of power at work, you’re unlikely to see workplace harassment in front of you. That’s because harassment and bullying are attempts to exert power over people with less of it. People who behave improperly don’t tend to do so with people they perceive as having power already.   — Sarah Milstein

White straight married couples with children who go to church regularly are no longer the American mainstream. An entire way of life, one in which their values were dominant, could be headed for extinction.

   I’ve just ordered myself a custom Timbuk2 messenger bag. 

 Custom? Yes, custom: you pick and choose fabrics and colours and various other options. This is mine. 

 I have had a great red/gray reversible messenger bag for many years that my sister Gaby gave me. First one of the inside clips broke so it needed to stay gray, now the outside closing clip broke.

  <p>I’ve just ordered myself a custom Timbuk2 messenger bag.</p>

<p>Custom? Yes, custom: you pick and choose fabrics and colours and various other options. <a href="https://www.timbuk2.com/pages/customizer#/bag/5009927">This is mine</a>.</p>

<p>I have had a great red/gray reversible messenger bag for many years that my sister Gaby gave me. First one of the inside clips broke so it needed to stay gray, now the outside closing clip broke.</p>

<p>I still use it while walking, but open bag flaps and biking don’t mix.</p>

<p>Asking the Internet about bags is hard, so I went to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/our-favorite-messenger-bags/">Wirecutter and they said Timbuk2</a>.</p>

<p>When I was looking earlier the custom options weren’t as obvious, and I kind of wandered off. Did I want a bag the same as everybody else, especially in drab colours?</p>

<p>Which led me over to <a href="https://www.freitag.ch/en/shop/bags/messenger">Freitag</a>, which my current bag is sometimes confused for.</p>

<p>Colourful, unique, up-cycled bags? Yes! Well, except for two things.
1. Fashion is pricey — about $350CAD before shipping
2. Did I really want to ship up-cycled bags across the ocean?</p>

<p>For a well-made, relatively unique bag that I intend to keep for a decade, price isn’t the barrier.</p>

<p>But (2) got me thinking: can we ship IP rather than products?</p>

<p>Especially as the pandemic has people thinking about supply chains and supporting the local economy, what would it take to collaborate with someone locally in Vancouver and make a bag?</p>

<p>Vancouver has lots of apparel, outer wear, and other gear designers, so that’s a plus.</p>

<p>And in fact, when I asked around and shared the idea a bit, both of the people I talked to had a 1-degree connection to people who had made bags. And then I even found a 1-degree connection of my own who had made his own bag and was making more.</p>

<p>So let’s say I budget $400-$500 for a customer one of a kind bag. Could I find 10 or 12 other people locally who would be interested?</p>

<p>And once I did this, could I make the design (and sourcing of materials and manufacturing/sewing, etc) available for others to do in their local areas?</p>

<p>Yes, I could. And we might just have a little network of locally made goods. Never mind connected links of makers and supporters interested in this sort of thing.</p>

<p>Are you interested in the Vancouver custom bag experiment? Is there another custom thing you’d like to see created locally? Let me know!</p>

<p>More on co-op models and small business peers and shipping IP another time.</p>

  <p>Starting from the north end of Commercial Drive where we live, we did a grand loop and various adventures on the e-bike today.</p>

<p>We started at Woodland and Venables, going up Woodland to the 10th Ave bike route and headed west.</p>

 Federal Store, Quebec at 10th 

<p></p>

<p>First stop was at <a href="https://federalstore.ca/">The Federal Store</a>, on 10th just before Ontario.</p>

<p>Rachael’s tea latte cup had a lovely little stamp. My cappuccino just had “The Federal Store” stamp. Note: The Federal Store has <a href="https://allthebest.recipes/t/johnnys-pops-handmade-popsicles/455">Johnny’s Pops</a> and is open most days until 6pm.</p>

<p>Then headed south on Ontario Street.</p>

 Main at 28th 

<p></p>

<p>Rachael went across the street to <a href="https://allthebest.recipes/t/jasmine-mediterranean-foods-halal-meats/328/2">Jasmine Mediterranean Foods</a> for fresh limit (Turkish bagel) and picked up a few other things.</p>

 Riley Park (Ontario at 30th) 

<p></p>

<p>We lay in the grass at Riley Park. It was a gloriously sunny day, but with a bit of a breeze blowing. We had our coffee &amp; tea drinks with limit and hung out for a bit.</p>

<p>Looking at the map, it seemed like a pretty straight forward route south on Ontario and then east on Kent to the River District, which is a <a href="https://vanmuralfest.ca/festival/riverdistrict">new Van Mural Fest neighbourhood</a>.</p>

<p>Rachael and I have never been down in that area at all, so seemed like a good adventure destination.</p>

 East Kent Avenue 

<p>We drove down Ontario until we hit Marine Drive. We passed by <a href="https://coupland.com/infinite-tire/">Coupland’s Infinite Tire</a> and continued on a couple of blocks into an industrial area and a set of east - west train tracks. There’s a great bike path all along Kent Avenue.</p>

<p>It’s a bit confusing at times which side of the tracks you need to be on. Both are East Kent Avenue, labeled S or N. In some places there is a clearly marked and dedicated bike path, in others you’re going along the road.</p>

 Gladstone-Riverside Park 

<p></p>

<p>We stopped at <a href="https://covapp.vancouver.ca/ParkFinder/ParkDetail.aspx?inparkid=193">Gladstone-Riverside Park</a> – we made it to the Fraser River! Across the river is Richmond, so this is the southern edge of City of Vancouver.</p>

<p>There are a variety of both bike paths and walking paths, again on either a northern “road” path (which had bike paths, too), or a mixed pedestrian - bike path walk ways on parks and green space that is right next to the river. Several other bikers and e-scooters were stopping and looking at maps.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You can see in the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/azNyHaAbyGoNq94w5">map</a> the dotted green paths along the river, as well as East Kent N and S. We stayed on the road (which had a separated two way bike path), as the park paths had a lot of pedestrians.</p>

<p>It was very interesting to see the mix of single family homes but really quite a lot of condos and townhouses either newly built or under construction. This is an area that I know nothing about. It was nice to have bike paths, but it seemed like where we were there was no transit at all, and no retail either. I guess all of that runs along Marine Way.</p>

 River District Murals 

<p>Here’s a <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/euMn3uFswqrU5qAWA">custom Map label for roughly where the murals are</a> (you can see it in the screenshot above on the right hand edge).</p>

<p>It’s in the middle of a ton of construction, and there are detours and fences that will guide you in a loop through the construction. If you’re following audio map directions, they will be very confused and insist that you u-turn :)</p>

<p><a href="https://rachaelashe.com">Rachael</a> did a much better job capturing the murals and artists, so I’ll embed her Instagram here:</p>

<p></p><blockquote>  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CEh-FW8hF4v/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading">                    View this post on Instagram                            </a> <p> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CEh-FW8hF4v/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading">@bmann and I did an epic ride to the River District to see @vanmuralfest murals. A few are finished but most are still works in progress. They are all fantastic. It’s an area we’d never explored before along the Fraser River… . #getoutside #vancouvermuralfestival #vancouvermural #publicart #streetart #vancouverart #yvrart #vanmuralfest #explorevmf</a></p> <p>A post shared by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rachael_ashe/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading"> Rachael Ashe - Paper Artist</a> (@rachael_ashe) on Aug 30, 2020 at 3:48pm PDT</p> </blockquote> <p></p>

<p>The murals are great and many of the artists are at the end of their epic week or so of painting. Apparently they will be up in this temporary space for about a year or so – installed along fencing and the path that detours through the construction site.</p>

<p>The photos I captured below really were about me thinking about this construction and neighbourhood and some of the contrasts.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I asked this artist how they got here, and they said Uber. I continue to have questions about how we’re still building car oriented dense housing in Vancouver.</p>

<p>This and the next murals were along an east-west path, fencing off a construction site with a few abandoned industrial buildings still remaining.</p>

<p>The sketched out design looked super cute!</p>

 Overhead Power and Construction 

<p></p>

<p>You see old, original poles, skinny and weathered brown, and the new, larger, treated greenish poles. And this ridiculous jumble of overhead wires that we have all throughout Vancouver. Even in this new area, I guess they’re not burying lines and laying fibre for Internet?!?!?</p>

<p>Lists all the artists. More discarded building materials and some sort of hangar or industrial building in the fenced off area.</p>

 Looking west, Rachael looks at a mural 

<p></p>

<p>The fence to the north (right in this photo) blocks off rail tracks, then East Kent Ave N, with condos, townhouses going up on the north side of that avenue.</p>

 Blackberries, Barbed Wire, Power, and Construction 

<p></p>

 Kerr Avenue 

<p>After seeing all the murals, it was time to head home. There are a couple of different south / east routes, the most straightforward looked to be heading back along East Kent, and then going north on Kerr Avenue.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Well, it turns out Kerr is an incredibly steep climb from East Kent to Marine Drive, and then keeps going up with Fraserview Golf Course on one side and Everett Crowley Park on the other. The area at the top is called Champlain Heights :)</p>

<p>Anyway, got off the bike and walked it up a good chunk of this. Not enough power for getting both of us up here. There are a couple of epic hills in Vancouver, where a slightly more powerful motor would really help.</p>

<p>We stayed on Kerr until it turns into Rupert next to Killarney Park, then west on East 45th which is a bike route.</p>

<p>Then right and north on Earles Street, crossing Kingsway at the Purdy’s Chocolate factory.</p>

<p>Left and west on Vanness, which turns into BC Parkway path, and a little left along the edge of Slocan Park.</p>

<p>Right and north on Slocan, which is a long down slope. You’ll pass <a href="https://allthebest.recipes/t/banana-grove-market-deli/441">Banana Grove Market</a> at 22nd, and keep going down and north until you hit South Grandview Highway.</p>

<p>Cross that, and you’ll hang a left and be heading west on North Grandview Highway, which is the Central Valley Greenway.</p>

<p>The CVG has been another common route for us, we’ll often head out to Burnaby Lake. But heading home and west we go to Lakewood, and then head right and south until we hit Adanac, and then turn left and west until we’re back at Commercial Drive and home.</p>

<p>We were at one bar of power by the time we made it home, so one of the longest trips we’ve made. Doing a rough map calculation shows about 30km. There are a couple of mega hills in there as well as just long continuous slopes that are rough with two of us on the bike.</p>

 Wesgroup 

<p>At home now, I’m doing a little research on this River District. This is a “planned community” being built by Wesgroup. Here’s <a href="https://wesgroup.ca/news/river-district-is-the-last-waterfront-neighbourhood/">one article</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The River District is located along the Fraser River, just off Marine Way, west of Boundary. It is a brand new, award-winning, master-planned community created by Wesgroup – a Vancouver based builder that has been building in the Lower Mainland for over 50 years. Wesgroup has spent the last decade carefully planning River District, the last waterfront development in the city.
Spanning 130 acres, it is three times the size of Granville Island and will soon become a vibrant destination for living and shopping when complete in 2017…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s now 2020, and there are lots of new homes completed, but as you can see from my photos, lots of new buildings still going up.</p>

<p>Transforming the customer experience is at the heart of digital transformation. Digital technologies are changing the game of customer interactions, with new rules and possibilities that were unimaginable only a few years back. Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) is a whole emerging area in the IAM, which is essentially an ingredient for digital customer experience.</p><p>Today’s increasingly sophisticated consumers now view digital interactions as the primary mechanism for interacting with brands and, consequently, expect deeper online relationships delivered simply and unobtrusively. CIAM turns customer data into Gold! Scalability, Security &amp; Privacy, Usability, Extensibility, and APIs &amp; Integration are the five pillars of CIAM. The following video talks about these five pillars in&nbsp;detail.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com/five-pillars-of-ciam-d5657a9e375b">Five Pillars of CIAM</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com">FACILELOGIN</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>The other day I made a
<a href="https://octodon.social/@cwebber/104746037303599668">sadpost on the fediverse</a>
that said: "simultaneously regularly feel like people don't take the
directions I'm trying to push seriously enough and that I'm not worth
taking seriously".
(Similarly, I've also joked that "imposter syndrome and a Cassandra
complex are a hell of a combo" before.)
I got a number of replies from people, both publicly and privately, and
the general summary of most of them are, "We do care!  The stuff you're
working on seems really cool and valuable!  I'll admit that I don't
really know what it is you're talking about but it sounds important!"
(Okay, and I just re-read, and it was only a portion of it that even said
the latter part, but of course, what do I emphasize in my brain?)
That was nice to hear that people care and are enthusiastic, and I did
feel much better, but it did also kind of feel like confirmation that
I'm not getting through to people completely either.</p>
<p>But then <a href="https://mastodon.sdf.org/@jfred">jfred</a> made an
<a href="https://mastodon.sdf.org/@jfred/104747234928467298">interesting reply</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yeah, that feels familiar. Impostor syndrome hits hard. You're
definitely worth taking seriously though, and the projects you're
working on are the most exciting ones I've been following.</p>
<p>As for people not taking the directions you're pushing
seriously... I've felt the same at work, and I think part of it is
that there's only so much one person can do. But also part of it is:
<a href="http://habitatchronicles.com/2004/04/you-cant-tell-people-anything/">http://habitatchronicles.com/2004/04/you-cant-tell-people-anything/</a></p>
<p>...it's hard to get ideas across to someone until they can interact
with it themselves</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So first of all, what a nice post!
Second of all, it's kind of funny that jfred replied with this because
out of everyone, jfred is one of the people who's picked up and
understood what's happening in
<a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblins">Spritely Goblins</a>
in particular the most, often running or creating demos of things on
top of it using things I haven't even documented yet (so definitely
not a person I would say isn't taking me seriously or getting what the
work is doing).</p>
<p>But third, that link to <a href="http://habitatchronicles.com/">Habitat Chronicles</a>
is right on point for a few reasons: first of all, Spritely is hugely
influenced by the various generations of Habitat, from the original
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVpulhO3jyc">first-ever-graphical-virtual-worlds Habitat</a>
(premiering on the Commodore 64 in the mid 1980s, of all things!)
to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNiePoNiyvE">Electric Communities Habitat</a>,
especially because that's where the <a href="http://erights.org/">E programming language</a>
came from, which I think it's safe to say has had a bigger influence on
<a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblins">Spritely Goblins</a> than anything
(except maybe
<a href="http://mumble.net/~jar/pubs/secureos/secureos.html">this paper by Jonathan Rees</a>,
which is the first time I realized that "oh, object capability security
is just normal programming flow").
But also, that blogpost in particular was so perfect about this subject:
<a href="http://habitatchronicles.com/2004/04/you-cant-tell-people-anything/">You can't tell people anything</a>...!</p>
<p>In summary, the blogpost isn't saying that people aren't foolishly
incapable of understanding things, but that people in general don't
understand well by "being explained to".
What helps people understand is experiences:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Eventually people can be educated, but what you have to do is find a
way give them the experience, to put them in the
situation. Sometimes this can only happen by making real the thing
you are describing, but sometimes by dint of clever artifice you can
simulate it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This really congealed for me and helped me feel justified in an
approach I've been taking in the Spritely project.
In general, up until now I've spent most of my time between two
states: coding the backend super-engineering stuff, and coding
demos on top of it.
You might in the meanwhile see me post technobabble onto
<a href="https://octodon.social/@cwebber/">my fediverse</a> or
<a href="https://twitter.com/dustyweb">birdsite</a> accounts, but I'm not in
general trying too hard to write about the structurally interesting
things going on until it comes time to write documentation
(whether it be for <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/goblins/index.html">Goblins</a>,
or the <a href="https://gitlab.com/dustyweb/magenc/blob/master/magenc/scribblings/intro.org">immutable storage</a>
and <a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/crystal/blob/master/crystal/scribblings/intro.org">mutable storage</a> writeups).
But in general, the way that I'm convinced people will get it is not
by talk but by first, demonstration, and second, use.</p>
<p>Aside from the few people that have picked up and played with Goblins
yet, I don't think I've hit a sufficient amount of "use" yet in Spritely.
That's ok, I'm not at that stage yet, and when I am, it'll be fairly clear.
(ETA: one year from now.)
So let's talk about demonstration.</p>
<p>The first demo I wrote was the
<a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/golem/blob/master/README.org">Golem demo</a>,
that showed roughly that distributed but encrypted storage could be
applied to the fediverse.
Cute and cool, and that turned the heads of a few fediverse
implementers.</p>
<p>But let's face it, the best demo I've done yet was the
<a href="https://dustycloud.org/blog/goblins-time-travel-micropreview/">Terminal Phase time travel demo</a>.
And it didn't hurt that it had a cool looking animated GIF to go
with it:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Prior to this demo, people would ask me, "What's this Goblins thing?"
And I'd try to say a number of things to them... "oh, its a
distributed, transactional, quasi-functional distributed programming
system safe to run in mutually suspicious networks that follows object
capability security and the classic actor model in the style of the E
programming language but written in Scheme!"
And I'd watch as their eyes glaze over because
why wouldn't their eyes glaze over after a statement like that, and
then I'd try to explain the individual pieces but I could tell
that the person would be losing interest by then and
why wouldn't they lose interest but even realizing that I'd kind of
feel despair settling in... </p>
<p>But when you show them a pew pew space lasers game and oh wow why
is there time travel, how did you add time travel, is it using
functional reactive programming or something?
(Usually FRP systems are the only other ones where people have
seen these kinds of time travel demos.)
And I'd say nope!
It doesn't require that.
Mostly it looks like writing just straightahead code but you get
this kind of thing for free.
And the person would say, wow!
Sounds really cool!  How much work does it take to add the time
travel into the game?
And I just say: no extra work at all.
I wrote the whole game without testing anything about time travel or
even thinking about it, then later I just threw a few extra lines to
write the UI to expose the time travel part and it just worked.  And
that's when I see peoples' heads explode with wonder and the
connections start to be made about what Goblins might be able to do.</p>
<p>But of course, that's only a partial connection for two reasons.
One is that the time travel demo above only shows off a small,
minute part of the features of Goblins.
And actually, the least interesting of them!
It doesn't show off the distributed programming or asynchronous
programming parts, it doesn't show off the cool object capability
security that's safe to run in mutually suspicious networks.
But still: it gave a taste that something cool is happening here.
Maybe Chris hasn't just been blowing a bunch of time since
finishing the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">ActivityPub</a>
standardization process
<a href="https://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/6785">about two and a half years ago</a>.
(Yikes, two and a half years ago!?!)</p>
<p>To complete the rest of that demonstration of the other things
in the system requires a different kind of demo.
Terminal Phase was a demo to show off the synchronous half of Goblins,
but where Goblins really shines is in the asynchronous, distributed
programming stuff.
That's not ready to show off yet, but I'll give you the first taste
of what's in progress:</p>
<p></p>
<p>(Actually a bit more has progressed since I've recorded that GIF,
multiple chatrooms and etc, but not really worth bothering to show
off quite yet.)</p>
<p>Hmm, that's not really all that thrilling.  A chatroom that looks about
the same level of featureful, maybe less, than IRC?
Well, it could be more exciting if you hear that the
<a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblin-chat/-/blob/94207fd0f3290f8ec6b087cde167bc78a6329560/chat-backend.rkt">full chat protocol implementation</a>
is only about 250 lines of code, including authenticating users and
posts by users.
That's smaller even than its
<a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblin-chat/-/blob/94207fd0f3290f8ec6b087cde167bc78a6329560/goblin-chat-gui.rkt">corresponding GUI code</a>,
which is less than 300 lines of code.
So the exciting thing there is how much heavy lifting Goblins takes
care of for you.</p>
<p>But that's hardly razzle-dazzle exciting.
In order for me to hint at the rest of what's happening here, we need
to put out an asynchronous programming demo that's as or more
interesting than the time travel demo.
And I expect to do that.
I hope soon enough to show off stuff that will make people go,
"Oh, what's going on here?"</p>
<p>But even that doesn't complete the connection for people,
because showing is one thing but to complete the loop, we need
people to use things.
We need to get this stuff in the hands of users to play with and
experiment themselves.
I have plans to do that... and not only that, make this stuff
not intimidating for newcomers.
When Spritely guides everyday people towards extending Spritely from
inside of Spritely as it runs, that's when it'll really click.</p>
<p>And once it clicks sufficiently, it'll no longer become exciting,
because people will just come to expect it.
A good example of that comes from the aforementioned
<a href="http://habitatchronicles.com/2004/04/you-cant-tell-people-anything/">You can't tell people anything</a> article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Years ago, before Lucasfilm, I worked for <a href="http://xanadu.com/">Project Xanadu</a>
(the original hypertext project, way before this newfangled World
Wide Web thing). One of the things I did was travel around the
country trying to evangelize the idea of hypertext. People loved it,
but nobody got it. Nobody. We provided lots of explanation. We had
pictures. We had scenarios, little stories that told what it would
be like. People would ask astonishing questions, like “who’s going
to pay to make all those links?” or “why would anyone want to put
documents online?” Alas, many things really must be experienced to
be understood. We didn’t have much of an experience to deliver to
them though — after all, the whole point of all this evangelizing
was to get people to give us money to pay for developing the
software in the first place! But someone who’s spent even 10 minutes
using the Web would never think to ask some of the questions we got
asked.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eventually, if we succeed, the ideas in Spritely will no longer seem
exciting... because people will have internalized and come to expect
them.
Just like hyperlinks on the web today.</p>
<p>But to get there, in the meanwhile, we have to get people interested.
To become so successful as to be mundane, we have to first be
razzle-dazzle exciting.
And to that end, that's why I take the demo approach to Spritely.
Because it's hard to tell someone something... but showing them,
that's another matter.</p>
<p>PS: It's also not true that people don't get what I'm doing, and
that's even been reflected materially.
I've been lucky to be supported over the last few years from a
combination of
<a href="https://dustycloud.org/blog/samsung-stack-zero-grant/">a grant from Samsung's Stack Zero</a>
and
<a href="https://dustycloud.org/blog/spritely-nlnet-grant/">one from NLNet</a>,
not to mention quite a few <a href="https://www.patreon.com/cwebber">donors on Patreon</a>.
I do recognize and appreciate that people are supporting me.
In some ways receiving this support makes me feel more seriously about the
need to demonstrate and prove that what I'm doing is real.
I hope I am doing and will continue to do a sufficient job, and hope that
the upcoming demos contribute to that more materially!</p>
<p>PPS: If, in the meanwhile, you're already excited, check out
the <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/goblins/index.html">Goblins documentation</a>.
The most exciting stuff is coming in the next major release
(which will be out soon), which is when the distributed programming
tools will be made available to users of the system for the first time.
But if you want to get a head start, the code you'll be writing will
mostly work the same between the distributed and non-distributed
(as in, distributed across computers/processes) asynchronous stuff,
so if you start reading the docs today, most of your code will already
just work on the new stuff once released.
And if you do start playing around, maybe drop by the
<a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=spritely">#spritely channel on freenode</a>
and say hello!</p>

 The App Store is a problem.  As bought into the Apple ecosystem as I am - to be clear, its devices and operating systems are by far the best I've ever used - the way it polices its software ecosystem has become a barrier to innovation.

<p>The App Store is a problem.</p><p>As bought into the Apple ecosystem as I am - to be clear, its devices and operating systems are by far the best I've ever used - the way it polices its software ecosystem has become a barrier to innovation.</p><p>I don't really care about Fortnight, and I'm on the fence about whether allowing effectively another App Store inside an App Store is a good idea. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/28/apple-terminates-epic-games-developer-account/">But removing a developer's ability to publish anything on a platform</a>, regardless of whether it breaks the rules or not, seems like a big problem to me. And the rules around payments are worse.</p><p>If your app uses in-app payments of any kind, Apple takes a 30% cut. These payments can only be for virtual goods: you'll notice that if you take a Lyft ride or order a pizza, you'll be redirected to either enter your credit card or use Apple Pay for payment. (Apple takes a 0.15% cut of Apple Pay payments, regardless of the card you use.) The trick is that you can't use this latter method of payment if you could have used in-app payments: if you ask for a credit card for a digital good, but still allow the user to pay in-app, Apple still wants its 30%.</p><p>This is unequivocally digital <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent-seeking">rent-seeking</a>. There's literally no reason for Apple to do this, except to bolster <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/07/apple-app-store-had-estimated-gross-sales-of-50-billion-in-2019.html">the estimated $50B it made last year from the App store</a>. It's one major reason why it's the most valuable company in the world, with a $2.13 trillion market cap as of Friday.</p><p>It's a gatekeeper rather than a driver of innovation. As Francisco Tolmasky pointed out, Apple's App Store rules <a href="https://twitter.com/tolmasky/status/1297199788316692480">wouldn't have allowed for the invention of the web browser</a>. There are likely many other inventions that would have been amazing on mobile and tablet devices that will never see the light of day because they fall afoul of some rule or other.</p><p>Similarly, it's been disheartening to see these rules start to bleed over into macOS. That OS contains a technology - <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491">literally called Gatekeeper</a> - that prevents apps from running unless they're associated with an authorized developer ID. By default, the latest version will only open apps that have been notarized by Apple, which involves some extra software-driven checks in XCode. The only way to run an app that doesn't at least have a developer ID is to open up system preferences and reassure Gatekeeper that it's all going to be okay, on an individual basis - but macOS deliberately doesn't make it clear that you can do this.</p><p>Getting a developer ID costs a flat $99 a year. This heavily excludes developers from less wealthy regions of the world, as well as open source projects. And I strongly suspect that the rules will tighten up again - either formally or through interface changes - in the next version of macOS.</p><p>These are our devices; we bought them. We should be able to run the software we want on them. Anything else is heavily disempowering at best, and a barrier to trade and innovation at worst. And developers like Epic are experiencing firsthand where the chips fall.</p>

That’s where we see the need for a carefully designed integrated supply chain for&nbsp;CIAM.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/supplychain.asp">general</a>, a supply chain is a system of organizations, people, activities, information, and other resources involved in supplying a product or service to a consumer, from the inception to delivery.

In doing that, you will also find out the suppliers that you need to work with.

You need not to build everything from&nbsp;scratch.</p><p>Uber for example, uses Google Maps, for navigation. It’s one of the most critical parts of Uber to build a smooth experience for its riders. From 2016 to 2018, Uber <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2019/04/12/uber-ipo-google-maps-goog-investment.html">paid</a> 58M USD to Google for using Google Maps.

For each of these systems, you would need to pick a supplier or vendor. Once again, one of the McKinsey <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/advanced-electronics/our-insights/reimagining-industrial-supply-chains#">reports</a> claims — technology companies have an average of 125 suppliers in their tier-one&nbsp;group.</p><p>Then again you need not to pick everything at once. You can go for a phased approach.</p><p>In the development phase, you start building your CIAM solution, by integrating multiple systems together, which should finally result in the right-level of user experience that would help you to drive the revenue growth by leveraging identity data to acquire and retain customers.</p><p>Then during the deployment phase you need to come up with a model to address some of your non-functional requirements such as scalability, security and so on. Once the system is up and running — you start on-boarding customers. Now you need to start monitoring the customer experience — you need to see how the customers use your product, their pain points, and so on — and then the digital supply chain will continue.</p><p>Then, you go to the next phase, do the discovery based on the services you need, and keep&nbsp;going.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com/the-integrated-supply-chain-for-ciam-de06df281958">The Integrated Supply Chain for CIAM</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com">FACILELOGIN</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>The first time I ever tried a shakshuka I cooked it from <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/09/shakshuka-north-african-shirred-eggs-tomato-pepper-recipe.html">this recipe</a> by J. Kenji López-Alt. It quickly became my favourite breakfast.</p>
<p>The only good thing about this pandemic is that I've got to spend more time cooking. I've developed a variant on Kenji's shakshuka that I'm calling a Mexican bean shakshuka. It's delicious. Here's how to make it.</p>

<p></p>

 Ingredients 
 
 Red bell pepper, chopped small 
 Medium-sized red onion, chopped small 
 Olive oil (3 tablespoons) 
 4 eggs 
 3 cloves garlic, minced 
 2 cans tomatoes (I use <a href="https://www.muirglen.com/products/fire-roasted-diced-tomatoes/">Muir Glen fire roasted diced tomatoes</a>) 
 Half a can of black beans 
 2 teaspoons cumin 
 1.5 tablespoons paprika 
 Some salt 
 A chipotle pepper in adobo sauce (or half a pepper depending on your spiciness tolerance) - finely chopped 
 
<p>The crucial ingredient here is the chipotle pepper in adobo sauce (I use <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Morena-LA-MOR-CH-24/dp/B0000GGQD4">this La Morena one</a>). If you've never encountered these before they are absolute magic: a total explosion of flavour, and I keep on finding new uses for them (most recently spaghetti bolognese). The can contains 6-8 peppers and I only use one for this recipe (finely chopped) - thankfully once opened it lasts in the fridge for a couple of months.</p>
 Directions 
<p>There are three phases: charring the peppers and onions, cooking the sauce and poaching the eggs. It takes 25-30 minutes total.</p>
 
 Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large frying pan (or cast iron pan) 
 Add the chopped bell pepper and onion 
 Cook without stirring for 6 minutes - the idea is to get the ingredients to char a little 
 Stir once, then cook for another 4 minutes 
 Stir in the minced garlic and cook for 30 seconds 
 Stir in the cumin and paprika 
 Add the two cans of diced tomatoes, half can of black beans and the finely chopped chipotle-in-adobo. Mix well. 
 Simmer for ten minutes, stirring occasionally. 
 Make four equally spaced indentations in the sauce using a large spoon, place an egg in each one, then sprinkle the yolk with some salt 
 Cover with a lid and allow the eggs to poach for six minutes. 
 Serve! 
 
<p><a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/09/shakshuka-north-african-shirred-eggs-tomato-pepper-recipe.html">Kenji's recipe</a> includes photos illustrating how the egg poaching step works.</p>
<p>The great thing about a shakshuka is that it's an incredibly flexible dish. Once you've mastered the basic form it's easy to come up with new tasty variants based around the key idea of poaching eggs directly in the sauce. I sometimes make breakfast "shakshukas" out of leftovers from the night before - bean chiles and Indian curries have worked particularly well for that.</p>

  <p>This week I built a geospatial search engine for protected areas in California, shipped datasette-graphql 1.0 and started working towards the next milestone for Datasette Cloud.</p>

 California Protected Areas in Datasette 

<p>This weekend I learned about CPAD - the <a href="https://www.calands.org/cpad/">California Protected Areas Database</a>. It's a remarkable GIS dataset maintained by <a href="https://www.greeninfo.org/">GreenInfo Network</a>, an Oakland non-profit and released under a Creative Commons Attribution license.</p>

<p>CPAD is released twice annually as a shapefile. <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Feb/19/shapefile-to-sqlite/">Back in February</a> I built a tool called <a href="https://github.com/simonw/shapefile-to-sqlite">shapefile-to-sqlite</a>  that imports shapefiles into a SQLite or SpatiaLite database, so CPAD represented a great opportunity to put that tool to use.</p>

<p>Here's the result: <a href="https://calands.datasettes.com/">calands.datasettes.com</a></p>

<p>It provides faceted search over the records from CPAD, and uses my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-leaflet-geojson">datasette-leaflet-geojson</a> plugin to render the resulting geometry records on embedded maps.</p>

<p><a href="https://calands.datasettes.com/calands/superunits_with_maps?_search=golden+gate"></a></p>

<p>I'm building and deploying the site using <a href="https://github.com/simonw/calands-datasette/blob/main/.github/workflows/build-and-deploy.yml">this GitHub Actions workflow</a>. It <a href="https://github.com/simonw/calands-datasette/blob/99de39dd80a906f5c1f16724467b0cd55ba4ef36/download.sh#L1">uses conditional-get</a> (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/conditional-get">see here</a>) combined with the GitHub Actions cache to download the shapefiles as part of the workflow run only if the downloadable file has changed.</p>

<p>This project inspired some improvements to the underlying tools:</p>

 
 <code>datasette-leaflet-geojson</code> now <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-leaflet-geojson/issues/12">handles larger polygons</a> and is smarter about <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-leaflet-geojson/issues/14">knowing when to load additional JavaScript and CSS</a> 

 <code>shapefile-to-sqlite</code> can now <a href="https://github.com/simonw/shapefile-to-sqlite/issues/7]">create spatial indexes</a> and has a <a href="https://github.com/simonw/shapefile-to-sqlite/issues/9">new -c option</a> (inspired by <code>csvs-to-sqlite</code>) for extracting specified columns into separate lookup tables 
 

 datasette-graphql 1.0 

<p>I'm trying to get better at releasing 1.0 versions of my software.</p>

<p>For me, the most significant thing about a 1.0 is that it represents a promise to avoid making backwards incompatible releases until a 2.0. And ideally I'd like to avoid ever releasing 2.0s - my perfect project would keep incrementing 1.x dot-releases forever.</p>

<p>Datasette is currently at version 0.48, nearly three years after its first release. I'm actively working towards <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/milestone/7">the 1.0 milestone</a> for it but it may be a while before I get there.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql">datasette-graphql</a> is less than a month old, but I've decided to break my habits and have some conviction in where I've got to. I shipped <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/releases/tag/1.0">datasette-graphql 1.0</a> a few days ago, closely followed by a <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/releases/tag/1.0.1">1.0.1 release</a> with improved documentation.</p>

<p>I'm actually pretty confident that the functionality baked into 1.0 is stable enough to make a commitment to supporting it. It's a <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/blob/1.0.1/README.md">relatively tight feature set</a> which directly maps database tables, filter operations and individual rows to GraphQL. If you want to quickly start trying out GraphQL against data that you can represent in SQLite I think it's a very compelling option.</p>

<p>New <code>datasette-graphql</code> features this week:</p>

 
 Support for multiple reverse foreign key relationships to a single table, e.g. a <code>article</code> table that has <code>created_by</code> and <code>updated_by</code> columns that both reference <code>users</code>. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/blob/main/examples/related_multiple.md">Example</a>. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/issues/32">#32</a> 

 The <code>{% set data = graphql(...) %}</code> template function now accepts an optional <code>variables=</code> parameter. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/issues/54">#54</a> 

 The <code>search:</code> argument is now available for tables that are configured using Datasette's <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/full_text_search.html#configuring-full-text-search-for-a-table-or-view">fts_table mechanism</a>. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/issues/56">#56</a> 

 New example <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/blob/main/examples/fragments.md">demonstrating GraphQL fragments</a>. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/issues/57">#57</a> 

 Added GraphQL execution limits, controlled by the <code>time_limit_ms</code> and <code>num_queries_limit</code> plugin configuration settings. These default to 1000ms total execution time and 100 total SQL queries per GraphQL execution. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/blob/main/README.md#execution-limits">Limits documentation</a>. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/issues/33">#33</a> 
 

 Improvements to my TILs 

<p>My <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/">til.simonwillison.net</a> site provides a search engine and browse engine over the TIL notes I've been accumulating in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/til">simonw/til</a> on GitHub.</p>

<p>The site used to link directly to rendered Markdown in GitHub, but that has some disadvantages: most notably, I can't control the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> tag on that page so it has poor implications for SEO.</p>

<p>This week I switched it over to hosting each TIL as a page directly on the site itself.</p>

<p>The tricky thing to solve here was Markdown rendering. GitHub's Markdown flavour incorporates a bunch of useful extensions for things like embedded tables and code syntax highlighting, and my attempts at recreating the same exact rendering flow using Python's Markdown libraries fell a bit short.</p>

<p>Then I realized that GitHub provide <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/markdown/">an API</a> for rendering Markdown using the same pipeline they use on their own site.</p>

<p>So now the build script for the SQLite database that powers my TILs site <a href="https://github.com/simonw/til/blob/72036ade39616f5551f289e533162ebe726840b0/build_database.py#L46-L90">runs each document through that API</a>, but only if it has changed since the last time the site was built.</p>

<p>I wrote some notes on using their Markdown API in this TIL: <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/til/til/markdown_github-markdown-api.md">Rendering Markdown with the GitHub Markdown API</a>.</p>

<p>Storing the rendered HTML in my database also meant I could finally fix <a href="https://github.com/simonw/til/issues/12">a bug</a> with <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/til/feed.atom">the Atom feed</a> for that site, where advanced Markdown syntax wasn't being correctly rendered in the feed.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-atom">datasette-atom</a> plugin I use to generate the feed applies Mozilla's <a href="https://bleach.readthedocs.io/">Bleach</a> HTML sanitization library to avoid dynamically generated feeds accidentally becoming a vector for XSS. To support the full range of GitHub's Markdown in my feeds I released <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-atom/releases/tag/0.7">version 0.7</a> of the plugin with a deliberately verbose <code>allow_unsafe_html_in_canned_queries</code> plugin setting which can opt canned queries out of the escaping - which should be safe because a <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/sql_queries.html#canned-queries">canned query</a> running against trusted data gives the site author total control over what might make it into the feed.</p>

 Datasette Cloud 

<p>I'm spinning up work again on Datasette Cloud again, after several months running it as a private alpha. My next key milestone is to be able to charge subscribers money - I know from experience that until you're charging people actual money it's very difficult to be confident that you're working on the right things.</p>

  <p>Summary:      If your identity system doesn't use DIDs and verifiable credentials in a way that gives participants autonomy and freedom from intervening administrative authorities, then it's not SSI.</p>


<a></a>
 

A few days ago I was in a conversation with a couple of my <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/who-are-the-identerati">identerati</a> friends. When one used the term "SSI", the other asked him to define it since there were so many systems that were claiming to be SSI and yet were seemingly different. That's a fair question. So I thought I'd write down my definition in hopes of stimulating some conversation around the topic. 
<p></p>

<p>
    I think we've arrived at a place where it's possible to define SSI and get broad consensus about it. SSI stands for self-sovereign identity, but that's not really helpful since people have different ideas about what "sovereign" means and what "identity" means. So, rather than try to go down those rabbit holes, let's just stick with "SSI."1
</p>

<p>
    SSI has the following properties:
</p>
 
     SSI systems use <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/02/decentralized_identifiers.shtml">decentralized identifiers</a> (DIDs) to identify people, organizations, and things. Decentralized identifiers provide a cryptograhic basis for the system and can be employed so that they don't require a central administrative system to manage and control the identifiers. Exchanging DIDs is how participants in SSI create <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/authentic_digital_relationships.shtml">relationships</a>, a critical feature. 
     

     SSI participants use <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/12/verifiable_credential_exchange.shtml">verifiable credentials exchange</a> to share information (attributes) with each other to strengthen or enrich relationships. The system provides the means of establishing <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/10/fidelity_provenance_and_trust.shtml">credential fidelity</a>. 
     

     SSI supports <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/cogito_ergo_sum.shtml">autonomy for participants</a>. The real value proposition of SSI is autonomy—not being inside someone else's administrative system where they make the rules in a one sided way. Autonomy implies that participants interact as peers in the system. You can build systems that use DIDs and verifiable credentials without giving participants autonomy. 
     
 

<p>
    Beyond these there are lots of choices system architects are making. Debates rage about how specifically credential exchange should work, whether distributed ledgers are necessary, and, if so, how should they be employed. But if you don't use DIDs and verifiable credentials in a way that gives participants autonomy and freedom from intervening administrative authorities, then you're not doing SSI.
</p>

<p>
    As a consequence of these properties, participants in SSI systems use some kind of software agent (typically called a wallet for individuals) to create relationships and exchange credentials. They don't typically see or manage keys or passwords. And there's no artifact called an "identity." The primary artifacts are relationships and credentials. The user experience involves managing these artifacts to share attributes within relationships via credential exchange. This user experience should be common to all SSI systems, although the user interface and what happens under the covers might be different between SSI systems or vendors on those systems.
</p>

<p>
    I'm hopeful that, as we work more on interoperability, the implementation differences will fade away so that we have a single identity metasystem where participants have <a>choice about tools and vendors</a>. An identity metasystem is <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/08/youve_had_an_automobile_accident_multi-source_identity_to_the_rescue.shtml">flexible enough to support the various ad hoc scenarios that the world presents us</a> and will support <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/08/life-like_identity_why_the_internet_needs_an_identity_metasystem.shtml">digital interactions that are life-like</a>.

     This is not to say I don't have opinions on what those words mean in this context.

<p>I host a <a href="https://forum.dgov.foundation/c/weekly-dgov-calls">weekly call on distributed governance</a>. This blog provides my personal opinions but by all means view the <a href="https://youtu.be/Rb_HzFjBj4A">entire discussion here</a>&nbsp;.</p><p>One of the big debates in the Genesis DAO started by DAOstack was the question of anonymity. Should people be able to make proposals and ask for budgets without providing a real identity?</p><p>Part of the problem was a structural problem with DAOstack at the time: there was no escrow system. You could allocate funds to a project, but you could not hold the funds until the project was complete. In other words, everyone was paid up front for their project as soon as the group approved&nbsp;it.</p><p>Another aspect of the problem was human: we all feel a little weird chatting with someone faceless. On the discussion boards, one person could potentially have multiple pseudonyms. If we were discussing something controversial, it would be fairly easy for someone to pretend to be multiple people arguing for or against the proposal. It was also fairly easy to troll the system anonymously. It wasn’t as easy to game the voting, though it was certainly possible.</p> It Ain’t&nbsp;Real <p>The example of the Genesis DAO was somewhat trivial, because it was a small number of people who actually did know one another. None of the anonymous people seriously asked for budget (though there was an anonymous troll), the amounts of money in question weren’t huge, and it was a small enough community that everyone pretty much knew one&nbsp;another.</p><p>In real life, identity is fundamental to democracy. It amazes me how many people cherish their anonymity so much that this is under debate. <a href="https://forum.dgov.foundation/c/weekly-dgov-calls">Our weekly chat</a> about anonymity was wide-ranging, and as usual, we came to the conclusion that “it depends.”</p> Does It Really&nbsp;Depend? <p>Personally, I think it doesn’t depend on the situation at all. At almost all stages of governance, you need to know some information about the person. You almost never need to know their actual name, but you almost always need to know, at a minimum, whether they have the right to influence a particular situation.</p><p>My minimum viable values statement about governance is: If the decision will impact you, you should have the ability to influence the decision. How much influence you should have is a different question. For example, if you are not an expert on hydroelectric dams, maybe you don’t get to decide where to build the dam, but if you live near the river, your perspective should be taken into&nbsp;account.</p><p>This isn’t the way democracy runs today. Corporations make decisions that impact their workers, customers and the environment with no regard for their opinions. Governments determine foreign policy without having any responsibility for the citizens of foreign countries who will be impacted by those policies. Lawmakers in one state make laws that influence neighboring states. We call that democracy. I digress but it’s important. We are completely normalized to a situation in which, as long as we feel fairly treated inside our organization, the external people’s feelings are irrelevant to what we call fair&nbsp;process.</p> What’s in a&nbsp;Name? <p>Throughout most of the decision-making process, therefore, full anonymity is not appropriate. Knowing people’s name isn’t particularly important, but in each stage of the process, some identifying information is helpful to democracy.</p>  In discussions and sentiment signalling, you need to know a person’s affiliation and expertise. Are they a resident? Do they work for the solar panel company? Are they an expert in urban planning? Is the electric company going to make a bid to buy up their land if this project is approved? Did they educate themselves and read multiple perspectives on the issue at hand? In the best of cases, you would also show an indicator of their reputation in the domains being discussed.  In problem definition, you need to know the person’s sentiment and perspective on the issue as well as something about their cognitive abilities. Are they good at detail or systems-wide analysis? Can they integrate multiple perspectives and listen well to others? Does the makeup of the problem-definition team appropriately represent enough different perspectives on the problem? Are they good at asking deeper questions, or do you use a highly-facilitated problem-definition process?  For proposal-making, while it is often optimal to let everyone propose ideas, it’s equally important to have the right experts in the room. Is this person an electrician or architect? Have they done other successful projects in this specific area? Again, the best ideas might come from someone who doesn’t have the proper background, but the process of solidifying the proposal needs to be grounded in&nbsp;reality.  For voting you need to know that this is the individual they said they were, and that they are voting in accordance with the rules of the voting&nbsp;system.  For execution of the decision, you need to know the qualifications of the people carrying out the&nbsp;work.  For accountability, oversight and assessment of the process, you need to know the qualifications and the vested interests of the&nbsp;people.  Finally, for whistle-blowing, you need some level of anonymity but you may also need verifiable evidence. Throughout the entire process, there needs to be some mechanism for people to give feedback safely when their own self-interest might be endangered. Scientists at a chemical company are the best qualified to expose if there might be unpublished side-effects to some new product. If there are good enough privacy and anonymity controls, such information could be leaked more transparently while verifying the reliability of the&nbsp;sources.   Collapsing reality and&nbsp;desire <p>One of the reasons people clamor for anonymity is that the tech collapses our identity and name and private data. Identity isn’t just your name. All of your data doesn’t have to be identified in every transaction — collapsing these concepts is sloppy and leads people to think there are only two possibilities: complete anonymity and complete exposure.</p><p>Identifying yourself by your name is the easiest way for people to eliminate anonymity, but it exposes more information than is necessary. I think that most of the debate over anonymity is due to the fact that we haven’t found creative ways to de-couple someone’s actual name from other attributes about&nbsp;them.</p><p>Technically, it would be possible to create a system where someone has a different name to different people. I would look at all of Alice’s posts and develop an opinion of her. You might be looking at Andrea’s posts — not knowing that Andrea and Alice were actually the same person, but anonymized so that when we met this person in real life, let’s say it’s really Alexa, we wouldn’t be able to attribute that information to her unless she wanted us to. She might appear differently on different forums, because she’s more of an expert in oceanography than in architecture. That’s an extreme implementation, but it’s just one example of how technology can be used to provide us the information we need to form opinions online without compromising someone’s identity.</p><p>As soon as we recognize that we can develop solutions for allowing different levels of participation and providing the data we need without exposing something sensitive, we can start to have a conversation about the need for anonymity in specific situations.</p><p>Enjoy our <a href="https://youtu.be/Rb_HzFjBj4A">talk about anonymity and democracy</a>. Most people don’t agree with me on the call! Feel free to join us. We have new topics every week, and <a href="https://forum.dgov.foundation/c/weekly-dgov-calls">the call is open to&nbsp;all</a>.</p>

<p>Any other paid shipping options will still display – and be selectable by the customer! – but obviously they can just pick free shipping and there won’t be a charge.</p>

<p>So to give a “free” item to someone, make a dollar value discount code of the price of the item, so that the cost is zero, and then this free shipping rate will appear. Note: if you are dealing with multiple currencies, sometimes the conversion means that your dollar value discount code makes it not quite $0. You’ll need to experiment and set a discount $ value appropriately.</p>

<p>Cloud security is about much more than security functionality. The top cloud providers all seem to have a capable suite of security features and most surveyed organizations report that they see all the top cloud platforms as generally secure. So, why do 92% of surveyed organizations still <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/cloud-threat-report/">report</a> a cloud security readiness gap? They’re not comfortable with the security implications of moving workloads to cloud even if they believe it’s a secure environment and even if the platform offers a robust set of security features.&nbsp;</p><p>Two contributing factors to that gap include:</p>  78% reported that cloud requires different security than on-prem. With security skills at a shortage, the ability to quickly ramp up on a new architecture and a new set of security capabilities can certainly slow progress.<br>  Only 8% of respondents claimed to fully understand the cloud security shared responsibilities model; they don’t even know what they’re responsible for; never mind how to implement the right policies and procedures, hire the right people, or find the right security technologies.  <p>I recently posted about how Oracle is addressing the gap  on the <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/cloudsecurity/dao-research-examines-how-oracle-is-addressing-the-cloud-security-readiness-gap">Oracle Cloud Security blog</a>. There's a link in the post to a new whitepaper from Dao Research that evaluates the cloud security capabilities offered by Amazon AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.</p><p>Oracle took some criticism for arriving late to the game with our cloud infrastructure offering. But, several years of significant investments are paying off. Dao's research concludes that “Oracle has an edge over Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, as it provides a more centralized security configuration and posture management, as well as more automated enforcement of security practices at no additional cost. This allows OCI customers to enhance overall security without requiring additional manual effort, as is the case with AWS, Azure, and GCP.”<br></p><p>A key take-away for me is that sometimes, the competitive edge in security in delivered through simplicity and ease of use. We've <a href="https://www.schneier.com/news/archives/2012/12/complexity_the_worst.html">heard</a> over and over for several years that complexity is the enemy of security. If we can remove human error, bake-in security by default, and automate security wherever possible, then the system will be more secure than if we're relying on human effort to properly configure and maintain the system and its security.<br></p><p><a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/cloudsecurity/dao-research-examines-how-oracle-is-addressing-the-cloud-security-readiness-gap">Click here to check out the post and the Dao Research whitepaper</a>.<br></p>

<p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://shorensteincenter.org/new-digital-realities/">New Digital Realities; New Oversight Solutions</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Wheeler">Tom Wheeler</a>, <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=Phil+Verveer">Phil Verveer</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Kimmelman">Gene Kimmelman</a>&nbsp;suggest that “the problems in dealing with digital platform companies” strip the gears of antitrust and other industrial era regulatory machines, and that what we need instead is “a new approach to regulation that replaces industrial era regulation with a new more agile regulatory model better suited for the dynamism of the digital era.” For that they suggest “a new Digital Platform Agency should be created with a new, agile approach to oversight built on risk management rather than micromanagement.” They provide lots of good reasons for this, which you can read in depth <a href="https://shorensteincenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/New-Digital-Realities_Aug-2020.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>I’m on a list where this is being argued. One of those participating is Richard Shockey, who often cites his eponymous law, which says, “The answer is money. What is the question?” I bring that up as background for my own post on the list, which I’ll share here:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Digital Platform Agency proposal seems to obey a law like Shockey’s that instead says, “The answer is policy. What is the question?”</p>
<p>I think it will help, before we apply that law, to look at modern platforms as something newer than new. Nascent. Larval. Embryonic. Primitive. Epiphenomenal.</p>
<p>It’s not hard to think of them that way if we take a long view on digital life.</p>
<p>Start with this question: is digital tech ever going away?</p>
<p>Whether yes or no, how long will digital tech be with us, mothering boundless inventions and necessities? Centuries? Millenia?</p>
<p>And how long have we had it so far? A few decades? Hell, Facebook and Twitter have only been with us since the late ’00s.</p>
<p>So why start to regulate what can be done with those companies from now on, right now?</p>
<p>I mean, what if platforms are just castles—headquarters of modern duchies and principalities?</p>
<p>Remember when we thought IBM, AT&amp;T and the PTTs in Europe would own and run the world forever?</p>
<p>Remember when the BUNCH was around, and we called IBM “the environment?” Remember EBCDIC?</p>
<p>Remember when Microsoft ruled the world, and we thought they had to be broken up?</p>
<p>Remember when Kodak owned photography, and thought their enemy was Fuji?</p>
<p>Remember when recorded music had to be played by rolls of paper, lengths of tape, or on spinning discs and disks?</p>
<p>Remember when “social media” was a thing, and all the world’s gossip happened on Facebook and Twitter?</p>
<p>Then consider the possibility that all the dominant platforms of today are mortally vulnerable to obsolescence, to collapse under their own weight, or both.</p>
<p>Nay, the certainty.</p>
<p>Every now is a future then, every is a was. And trees don’t grow to the sky.</p>
<p>It’s an easy bet that every platform today is as sure to be succeeded as were stone tablets by paper, scribes by movable type, letterpress by offset, and all of it by xerography, ink jet, laser printing and whatever comes next.</p>
<p>Sure, we do need regulation. But we also need faith in the mortality of every technology that dominates the world at any moment in history, and in the march of progress and obsolescence.</p>
<p>Another thought: if the only answer is policy, the problem is the question.</p></blockquote>
<p>This suggests yet another another law (really an aphorism, but whatever): “The answer is obsolescence. What is the question?”</p>
<p>As it happens, I wrote about Facebook’s odds for obsolescence two years ago <a href="https://medium.com/@dsearls/the-human-solution-to-facebooks-machine-produced-problems-also-won-t-work-3364656bc257">here</a>. An excerpt:</p>
<blockquote><p>How easy do you think it is for Facebook to change: to respond positively to market and regulatory pressures?</p>
<p>Consider this possibility:&nbsp;it can’t.</p>
<p>One reason is structural. Facebook is comprised of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.quora.com/How-many-data-centers-does-Facebook-have-and-where-are-they-located">many data centers</a>, each the size of a Walmart or few, scattered around the world and costing many $billions to build and maintain. Those data centers maintain a vast and closed habitat where more than two billion human beings share all kinds of revealing personal shit about themselves and each other, while providing countless ways for anybody on Earth, at any budget level, to micro-target ads at highly characterized human targets, using up to millions of different combinations of targeting characteristics (including ones provided by parties outside Facebook, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Analytica">Cambridge Analytica</a>, which have deep psychological profiles of millions of Facebook members). Hey, what could go wrong?</p>
<p>In three words,&nbsp;the whole thing.</p>
<p>The other reason is operational. We can see that in how Facebook has handed fixing what’s wrong with it over to thousands of human beings, all hired to do&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-worst-job-in-technology-staring-at-human-depravity-to-keep-it-off-facebook-1514398398">what&nbsp;The Wall Street Journal&nbsp;calls</a>&nbsp;“The Worst Job in Technology: Staring at Human Depravity to Keep It Off Facebook.” Note that this is not the job of robots, AI, ML or any of the other forms of computing magic you’d like to think Facebook would be good at. Alas, even Facebook is still a long way from teaching machines to know what’s unconscionable. And can’t in the long run, because machines don’t have a conscience, much less an able one.</p>
<p>You know Goethe’s (or hell, Disney’s) story of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sorcerer%27s_Apprentice">The Sorceror’s Apprentice</a>? Look it up. It’ll help. Because Mark Zuckerberg is both the the sorcerer&nbsp;and&nbsp;the apprentice in the Facebook version of the story. Worse, Zuck doesn’t have the mastery level of either one.</p>
<p>Nobody,&nbsp;not even Zuck, has enough power to control the evil spirits released by giant machines designed to violate personal privacy, produce echo chambers beyond counting, amplify tribal prejudices (including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/world/asia/myanmar-government-facebook-rohingya.html">genocidal ones</a>) and produce many $billions for itself in an advertising business that depends on all of that—while also trying to correct, while they are doing what they were designed to do, the massively complex and settled infrastructural systems that make all if it work.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m not saying regulators should do nothing. I am saying that gravity still works, the mighty still fall, and these are facts of nature it will help regulators to take into account.</p>

   California Protected Areas Database in Datasette 
 I built this yesterday: it's a Datasette interface on top of the CPAD 2020 GIS database of protected areas in California maintained by GreenInfo Network. This was a useful excuse to build a GitHub Actions flow that builds a SpatiaLite database using my shapefile-to-sqlite tool, and I fixed a few bugs in my datasette-leaflet-geojson plugin as well.

  <p>This week I helped Natalie launch <a href="https://www.rockybeaches.com/">Rocky Beaches</a>, shipped Datasette 0.48 and several releases of <code>datasette-graphql</code>, upgraded the CSRF protection for <code>datasette-upload-csvs</code> and figured out how to get a commit log of changes to my blog by backing up its database to a GitHub repository.</p>
 Rocky Beaches 
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/natbat">Natalie</a> released the first version of <a href="https://www.rockybeaches.com/">rockybeaches.com</a> this week. It's a site that helps you find places to go tidepooling (known as rockpooling in the UK) and figure out the best times to go based on low tide times.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I helped out with the backend for the site, mainly as an excuse to further explore the idea of using Datasette to power full websites (previously explored with <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2019/Nov/25/niche-museums/">Niche Museums</a> and <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Apr/20/self-rewriting-readme/">my TILs</a>).</p>
<p>The site uses a pattern I've been really enjoying: it's essentially a static dynamic site. Pages are dynamically rendered by Datasette using Jinja templates and a SQLite database, but the database itself is treated as a static asset: it's built at deploy time by <a href="https://github.com/natbat/rockybeaches/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml">this GitHub Actions workflow</a> and deployed (currently to <a href="https://www.vercel.com/">Vercel</a>) as a binary asset along with the code.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/natbat/rockybeaches/blob/main/scripts/build.sh">build script</a> uses <a href="https://github.com/simonw/yaml-to-sqlite">yaml-to-sqlite</a> to load two YAML files - <a href="https://github.com/natbat/rockybeaches/blob/4127c0f0539178664cefed4aca00db2b5c00c855/data/places.yml">places.yml</a> and <a href="https://github.com/natbat/rockybeaches/blob/4127c0f0539178664cefed4aca00db2b5c00c855/data/stations.yml">stations.yml</a> - and create the <code>stations</code> and <code>places</code> database tables.</p>
<p>It then runs two custom Python scripts to fetch relevant data for those places from <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/">iNaturalist</a> and the <a href="https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/web_services_info.html">NOAA Tides &amp; Currents API</a>.</p>
<p>The data all ends up in the Datasette instance that powers the site - you can browse it at <a href="http://www.rockybeaches.com/data">www.rockybeaches.com/data</a> or interact with it using GraphQL API at <a href="http://www.rockybeaches.com/graphql">www.rockybeaches.com/graphql</a></p>
<p>The code is a little convoluted at the moment - I'm still iterating towards the best patterns for building websites like this using Datasette - but I'm very pleased with the productivity and performance that this approach produced.</p>
 Datasette 0.48 
<p>Highlights from <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-48">Datasette 0.48</a> release notes:</p>
 
 Datasette documentation now lives at <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/">docs.datasette.io</a> 
 The <code>extra_template_vars</code>, <code>extra_css_urls</code>, <code>extra_js_urls</code> and <code>extra_body_script</code> plugin hooks now all accept the same arguments. See <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/plugin_hooks.html#plugin-hook-extra-template-vars">extra_template_vars(template, database, table, columns, view_name, request, datasette)</a> for details. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/939">#939</a>) 
 Those hooks now accept a new <code>columns</code> argument detailing the table columns that will be rendered on that page. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/938">#938</a>) 
 
<p>I released a new version of <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-cluster-map">datasette-cluster-map</a> that takes advantage of the new <code>columns</code> argument to only inject Leaflet maps JavaScript onto the page if the table being rendered includes latitude and longitude columns - previously the plugin would load extra code on pages that weren't going to render a map at all. That's now running on <a href="https://global-power-plants.datasettes.com/">https://global-power-plants.datasettes.com/</a>.</p>
 datasette-graphql 
<p>Using <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql">datasette-graphql</a> for Rocky Beaches inspired me to add two new features:</p>
 
 A new <code>graphql()</code> Jinja custom template function that lets you execute custom GraphQL queries inside a Datasette template page - which turns out to be a pretty elegant way for the template to load exactly the data that it needs in order to render the page. Here's <a href="https://github.com/natbat/rockybeaches/blob/70039f18b3d3823a4f069deca513e950a3aaba4f/templates/row-data-places.html#L29-L46">how Rocky Beaches uses that</a>. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/issues/50">Issue 50</a>. 
 Some of the iNaturalist data that Rocky Beaches uses is stored as JSON data in text columns in SQLite - mainly because I was too lazy to model it out as tables. This was coming out of the GraphQL API as strings-containing-JSON, so I added a <code>json_columns</code> plugin configuration mechanism for turning those into Graphene <code>GenericScalar</code> fields - see <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/issues/53">issue 53</a> for details. 
 
<p>I also landed a big performance improvement. The plugin works by introspecting the database and generating a GraphQL schema that represents those tables, columns and views. For tables with a lot of tables this can get expensive, and the introspection was being run on every request.</p>
<p>I didn't want to require a server restart any time the schema changed, so I didn't want to cache the schema in-memory. Ideally it would be cached but the cache would become invalid any time the schema itself changed.</p>
<p>It turns out SQLite has a mechanism for this: the <code>PRAGMA schema_version</code> statement, which returns an integer version number that changes any time the underlying schema is changed (e.g. a table is added or modified).</p>
<p>I built a quick <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-schema-versions">datasette-schema-versions</a> plugin to try this feature out (in less than twenty minutes thanks to my <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Jun/20/cookiecutter-plugins/">datasette-plugin cookiecutter template</a>) and prove to myself that it works. Then I built a caching mechanism for <code>datasette-graphql</code> that uses the current <code>schema_version</code> as the cache key. See <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/issues/51">issue 51</a> for details.</p>
 asgi-csrf and datasette-upload-csvs 
<p><a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-upload-csvs">datasette-upload-csvs</a> is a Datasette plugin that adds a form for uploading CSV files and converting them to SQLite tables.</p>
<p>Datasette 0.44 <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/changelog.html#csrf-protection">added CSRF protection</a>, which broke the plugin. I fixed that this week, but it took some extra work because file uploads use the <code>multipart/form-data</code> HTTP mechanism and my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/asgi-csrf">asgi-csrf</a> library didn't support that.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://github.com/simonw/asgi-csrf/issues/1">fixed that</a> this week, but the code was quite complicated. Since <code>asgi-csrf</code> is a security library I decided to aim for 100% code coverage, the first time I've done that for one of my projects.</p>
<p>I got there with the help of codecov.io and <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pytest-cov/">pytest-cov</a>. I wrote up what I learned about those tools in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/til/blob/main/pytest/pytest-code-coverage.md">a TIL</a>.</p>
 Backing up my blog database to a GitHub repository 
<p>I really like keeping content in a git repository (see Rocky Beaches and Niche Museums). Every content management system I've ever been has eventually desired revision control, and modeling that in a database and adding it to an existing project is always a huge pain.</p>
<p>I have 18 years of content on this blog. I want that backed up to git - and this week I realized I have the tools to do that already.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/simonw/db-to-sqlite">db-to-sqlite</a> is my tool for taking any SQL Alchemy supported database (so far tested with MySQL and PostgreSQL) and exporting it into a SQLite database.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-diffable">sqlite-diffable</a> is a very early stage tool I built last year. The idea is to dump a SQLite database out to disk in a way that is designed to work well with git diffs. Each table is dumped out as newline-delimited JSON, one row per line.</p>
<p>So... how about converting my blog's PostgreSQL database to SQLite, then dumping it to disk with <code>sqlite-diffable</code> and committing the result to a git repository? And then running that in a GitHub Action?</p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog-backup/blob/main/.github/workflows/backup.yml">the workflow</a>. It does exactly that, with a few extra steps: it only grabs a subset of my tables, and it redacts the <code>password</code> column from my <code>auth_user</code> table so that my hashed password isn't exposed in the backup.</p>
<p>I now have <a href="https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog-backup/commits/main">a commit log</a> of changes to my blog's database!</p>
<p>I've set it to run nightly, but I can trigger it manually by clicking a button too.</p>

<p>What you see there is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flammagenitus_(cloud)">flammagenitus cloud</a> rising to the north above <a href="https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/6961/">Ranch 2</a>, a wildfire about fifteen miles east of here in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Gabriel_Mountains">San Gabriel Mountains</a>, just north of Asuza (one of too many towns to remember, in greater Los Angeles). If the video works, you’ll see how how the clouds give shape to the heat from the fire, even as smoke (darker and with a gray/magenta color) stopping at a lower elevation, spreads northward in the same direction.</p>
<p>The fire was caused by arson, <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/person-of-interest-possibly-connected-to-1500-acre-blaze-in-azusa/2413265/">says the guy</a> who confessed to starting it.</p>
<p>It’s interesting to see how much reporting on fires has changed in the time I’ve been <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=doc+searls+%23fire+inciweb&amp;ia=web">following stories like this</a> in Southern California. <a href="https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/">Inciweb</a>, the canonical close-to-live running catalog of wildfires in the U.S. has moved from the .org where it started to <a href="https://www.nwcg.gov/">NCWG.gov</a>, the National Coordinating Wildfire Group. When I <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/lets-do-news-what-we-did-software">first wrote about</a> Inciweb, back in ’06, I didn’t mention that it was entirely the heroic work of one Linux hacker at the Forest Service who didn’t wish to be identified.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you want to catch up on the Ranch2, one of <a href="https://fsapps.nwcg.gov/afm/data/activefiremaps/cgb2020230_1700.jpg">too many wildfires</a> clouding the western skies right now, <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=ranch2&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live">here’s the Twitter search for the latest</a>.</p>

 Introducing Self-Sovereign Student&nbsp;ID <blockquote>Part 2 of 2: ID Is Only the Beginning.</blockquote> Achievements, Skills, &amp; Competencies <p>For many working with SSI and VCs, exchanging achievements is the top-of-mind use case. By achievements, I mean any kind: diplomas, degrees, certificates, skills, <a href="https://www.stradaeducation.org/report/the-new-geography-of-skills/">skill shapes</a>, competencies, badges, milestones, grades, awards, commendations, micro-credentials, incremental achievements, and&nbsp;others.</p><p>Students will eventually share their achievements in pursuit of a job, but they also may want to transfer between schools, or <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeltnietzel/2019/02/19/reverse-transfer-a-second-chance-at-a-first-degree/#3ecc67bc7bea">reverse transfer</a> credits from their current school to a former one. SSI and VCs are the ideal means of receiving achievements in a form where they can be readily shared again, and instantly trustable without a manual verification process.</p><p>But unlike student ID, broadly useful achievements exchange among schools and employers not only requires them to become capable of issuing, holding, and verifying VCs, it also requires them to come to agreement about how the data payload should be arranged. This will happen, but it’s gonna take awhile. Thankfully, there is significant and growing momentum toward precisely that.</p><p>For example, serious efforts are underway at the <a href="https://www.uschamberfoundation.org/t3-innovation">T3 Innovation Network</a>, within the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, in developing <a href="https://lerhub.org/g/bqCgme2fQxDbgJ6D7">Learning and Employment Records</a>, or LERs. LERs are powered by the same VC standards and technologies that enable self-sovereign student ID, with the same issue, hold, verify model to/from an SSI wallet, which they call a “<a href="https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/preview/FeqEJI3S5KelmLv8XJss">learner wallet</a>” for simplicity. A learner wallet is the same as an SSI wallet, with one important addition: a learner wallet includes in its scope the capability for a student to store some VCs in a cloud-based container with a custodian, in place of or in addition to a personally held wallet, and retain self-sovereign control over them. This is useful with large data sets, infrequently used credentials, and as a backup, and is offered by the likes of ASU’s <a href="https://trust.asu.edu/">Trusted Learner Network</a> and the <a href="https://www.velocitynetwork.foundation/">Velocity Network Foundation</a>.</p><p>An impressive piece was recently released that everyone interested in interoperable achievements should read, whether in the U.S. or abroad: <a href="https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/preview/9g21loK6RriHFkPRE4zJ">Applying Self-sovereign Identity Principles To Interoperable Learning Records</a>. The lead author of that piece, <a href="https://twitter.com/kimdhamilton">Kim Hamilton Duffy</a>, also leads a group called the <a href="https://openlearning.mit.edu/news/university-led-digital-credentials-consortium-explores-technology-digital-academic-credentials">Digital Credentials Consortium</a> (DCC). DCC includes 14 intrepid schools, including the likes of MIT and Harvard, developing interoperability of achievements that are literally carried by the achievers. They also <a href="https://digitalcredentials.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/white-paper-building-digital-credential-infrastructure-future.pdf">see VCs</a> as the basis for this interoperability, and are making exciting progress.</p><p>My conclusion: VCs are where “the puck is headed” for broad, even global academic interoperability, they are the containers referred to in these documents that can securely transport the achievement or LER “payload” between issuers and verifiers, via the achiever&nbsp;herself.</p><p>By using this same VC technology for student ID, a school does three critical things to lay the foundation for later exchanging achievements:</p>  It puts the tools necessary for exchanging achievements into schools’ and students’ hands.  It gets schools familiar with working with VCs: issuing, verifying, and managing.  It gets students familiar with using an SSI wallet: making connections, receiving VCs, sharing VCs, communicating, giving consent,&nbsp;etc.  <p>After self-sovereign student ID is in place, issuing an achievement or LER to a student means simply clicking a different button (or&nbsp;two).</p> The “Digital Experience” <p>Education is increasingly engaged in digital transformation, from enrollment to instruction to achievement and employment. Through all the schools, programs and other experiences you might have, there is one thing that’s constant: you. You are the ideal courier of your own data whenever it’s useful to prove or qualify for something, if only you could receive your data, have a way to hold it and present it, and it was verifiable when presented. That is precisely what this technology does.</p><p>When you realize that self-sovereign student ID is simply a school-issued digital VC held inside a secure wallet capable of also storing verifiable achievements, and that wallet ideally belongs to the student and not the school, it becomes clear how it can become foundational to a lifetime digital learning experience for that learner. In this context, the “Digital Student ID” becomes a part of the digital experience rather than the whole of&nbsp;it.</p><p>This also ties into the <a href="https://www.stradaeducation.org/network/institute-for-the-future-of-work/">future of work</a>, where lifelong achievements can be accumulated by the student and later used to prove skills and competencies to prospective employers at a granular level, with the power of selective disclosure enabling strong privacy to avoid oversharing.</p><p>Taken together, this is direct application of the “Internet of Education” from the <a href="https://www.learningeconomy.io/">Learning Economy Foundation</a>, a vision that is now feasible and with which self-sovereign student ID is&nbsp;aligned.</p> Privileges, Perks, &amp;&nbsp;Freebies <p>Unlike typical digital credentials or even digital student ID, with self-sovereign student ID students can prove their ID and status anywhere, not just in school-approved or school-connected systems. This independence opens up the entire internet and the world itself, to embrace your school’s students as verifiably what they claim to be, and give them whatever benefits and privileges that status might conceivably afford. This could mean, at any non-school organization, online or&nbsp;off:</p>  Formless onboarding &amp; passwordless authentication at&nbsp;websites  Freebies, discounts and special deals&nbsp;anywhere  Access to students-only facilities and events from multiple&nbsp;schools  Access to special loans, grants, scholarships and&nbsp;more  <p>Intuitively, the more benefits you can arrange for your students, the more they will want to become your students; with self-sovereign student ID, you can unlock more benefits than ever&nbsp;before.</p> Communication &amp; Interaction <p>This category of capabilities is often overlooked in SSI, but I believe it could become the most used and beneficial class of capabilities that self-sovereign student ID enables. If you think about how much time we spend communicating versus how much time we spend authenticating, you’ll get where I’m coming&nbsp;from.</p><p>Before issuing a VC to a student, a direct connection must be established between the student’s chosen wallet and the school. This connection is unlike other connections the school may have with the student, and unlike the connections people have with each other; it is peer-to-peer, private, and encrypted end-to-end.</p><p>This connection between school and student isn’t ephemeral; it persists until either side breaks it, even for alumni who’ve long since left the school (useful for helping keep track of grads for annual IPEDS and other accreditation reporting), It is a new, private, digital relationship between school and student that enables interactions of many forms: messages, phone calls, video calls, file exchange, playing games, taking polls, voting, gathering permission or consent (digitally signed by the student), granting the school’s consent (digitally signed by the school), and&nbsp;more.</p><p>A bit like email, both your school and the student can use different services to help with your/their end of the connection. And these services are substitutable; there is no single vendor in the middle that is connecting both sides, as there is with popular messaging services today. If there were, then self-sovereign independence is lost and most of the benefits listed in this article along with it, replaced with dependence on that intermediary.</p><p>Using this capability, schools could do away with proprietary messaging systems they’ve installed to ensure <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html">FERPA</a>-protected data, for example, is not shared incorrectly, and instead use a standards-based system that comes for free with self-sovereign student&nbsp;ID.</p><p>This communication channel must be respected and not overused, because either side can choose to break it; it’s not like email or a phone number where the other party can simply resume sending messages from another address or device. Reconnection can happen at any time, but both parties must opt in. I particularly love this aspect of SSI, because it is the beginning of the end to spam and phishing, and encourages considerate communications behavior on all&nbsp;sides.</p> Preventing Fraud &amp;&nbsp;Phishing <p>Once issued to the student by the school, self-sovereign student ID helps prevent <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/college-identity-theft-a-growing-problem-1947515">student-related fraud</a>, including with student AID programs the student may apply for with outside organizations, such as government, scholarship programs, and others. Once these organizations realize they can receive cryptographic proof directly from the student, they can lessen their reliance on passwords, social security numbers, and other personal information, bringing us closer to a world devoid of identity theft, where having someone’s personal information — even their passwords — is no longer sufficient to impersonate them.</p><p>When a student applies and presents their VCs for verification, the benefits offeror, such as FAFSA in the U.S., can instantly and digitally verify, either remotely or in person, the student’s ID and status as a student, even when the organization isn’t connected to the school’s systems. Eventually, as VCs become more prevalent and the student acquires more VCs as they progress in their learner journey, they’ll be able to prove things like their citizenship or visitor status, high school diploma, GED, academic progress, and more, further preventing fraud and accelerating the process of applying for student&nbsp;aid.</p><p>Of course this use case requires the benefits offeror to gain the ability to verify VCs, which they could do tomorrow, but in reality may take&nbsp;awhile.</p><p>Phishing attempts to impersonate the school in communications with the student can also be detected and prevented, by sending school communications through the private SSI connection or by using it to validate communications sent via other means. And the school isn’t the only one fraudsters may try to impersonate: faculty, staff, tutors, proctors, authorized partners, service providers and more can be strongly and mutually authenticated by using this same capability.</p> Why Not Embed An SSI Wallet Into Your School’s Existing&nbsp;App? <p>We hear questions about “embedded wallets” a lot, and for good reason: your school has worked hard to get your official app into as many hands as possible, so adding functionality to it makes sense, whereas asking students to get another ‘app’ — even though an SSI wallet isn’t really an app — seems almost a non-starter.</p><p>Well, if a self-sovereign ‘wallet’ were just another app, and intended solely for interacting with your school, this sentiment would make perfect sense. But it isn’t, so it doesn’t, at least in the longer term. But it might in the short&nbsp;term.</p><p>We should unpack that a&nbsp;bit.</p><p>‘Wallet’ is a woefully inadequate term for what SSI is and does for a person; it is useful because it is an <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/when-explaining-ssi-start-with-the-wallet-bee5d2af6696">easy to understand</a> metaphor for the most basic building blocks of SSI, but it is ultimately misleading, like mistaking the trunk of an elephant <a href="http://www.simoncamilleri.com/the_truth_of_the_elephant/">for a snake</a>. SSI is more like a self-sovereign cockpit for consolidating all your relationships, not just your academic ones, and certainly not just one school. SSI consolidates, under your ultimate control, your connections, communications, interactions, agreements, preferences and data, even data not in your physical possession like medical data, which might be best physically stored with a healthcare provider or other custodian. Leaving all that in bespoke, embedded wallets from each provider brings you right back to the status quo, with your relationships, interactions, and data spread out and under the ultimate control of third parties, with all that entails: vendor lock-in; privacy, security, and compliance issues; ID theft; surveillance capitalism; duplicate relationships and data;&nbsp;etc.</p><p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity/own-your-identity">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2018/12/03/mastercard-microsoft-join-forces-to-advance-digital-identity-innovations/">Mastercard</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/solutions/identity/networks">IBM</a>, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/samsung-telcos-banks-to-collaborate-on-blockchain-mobile-authentication/">Samsung</a>, the <a href="https://www.culedger.com/">US Credit Union industry</a> and hundreds of others globally are now developing SSI/VC tech for use in many industries, so your school will soon not be the only entity offering SSI-powered benefits to your students, faculty and staff. Imagine if every organization embedded wallets into their own apps rather than working with an external one, or if every payment, ID, and loyalty card you carried required its own separate physical wallet… people would begin to get annoyed, to say the least, and prefer schools and organizations that made life easier, not&nbsp;harder.</p><p>All that said, an embedded wallet could be a reasonable tradeoff early on, when SSI is new and its first uses for your students may be limited to your school. So if you jump on self-sovereign student ID quickly as an early adopter, you could embed SSI/VC/wallet tech into your existing app, foregoing self-sovereignty for now without too much of a tradeoff, and still gain several of the key benefits mentioned. Then, as students, faculty, and staff begin to receive SSI connection requests and VC offers from their other relationships in life, and they start wanting to consolidate things, you can make moves toward greater self-sovereignty with less of a dilemma, counting on SSI’s standards-enabled portability.</p> What’s Ready&nbsp;Now?  What’s Ready   Code, Products, &amp; Services — Open source <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">code</a>; VC-oriented products from <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/identity-standards-blog/ion-booting-up-the-network/ba-p/1441552">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://credentials.workday.com/docs/overview/">Workday</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/solutions/identity">IBM</a>, and dozens of startups.  Compatibility With Existing Federated ID — CAS, Okta, Ping, ForgeRock, etc. for connecting with SAML, OAuth, OIDC and other federation protocols for passwordless login, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2018/01/22/everybody-knows-how-knowledge-based-authentication-died/">KBA</a>-free call-in, and cardless walk-in authentication.  Standards Work — <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/vc/participants">W3C</a>, <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust over IP Foundation</a>, <a href="https://identity.foundation/">DIF</a>  Custodial Solutions — <a href="https://trust.asu.edu/">Trusted Learner Network</a>, <a href="https://www.velocitynetwork.foundation/">Velocity Network Foundation</a>  Broad Consensus About VCs — The Verifiable Credential is the only <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/verifiable-credentials-arent-credentials-they-re-containers-fab5b3ae5c0">container</a> I’m consistently seeing under consideration for <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/how-verifiable-credentials-bridge-trust-domains-97155d0f3c17">transporting verifiable data between trust domains</a>, which self-sovereign control and trust require, from academia to healthcare to finance and&nbsp;beyond.  Broad Consensus About Individual Control of Data — From academia to healthcare to Europe’s GDPR and the current disdain for big tech and surveillance capitalism, I see broad consensus that control over data must move more and more into the hands of individuals, even data not in their physical possession.  Momentum — Years of global open-source development and standards work for SSI; orgs large and small in many industries are actively participating in developing VC code, standards, use cases and business models; strong support from the T3 Innovation Network in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.   What’s Not Ready&nbsp;(Yet)   User Experience — The SSI space knows the basics — issue, hold, and verify VCs — but does not yet have the UX figured out. Honestly, the existing SSI wallets I’ve seen are all still a bit clunky and confusing (even though it’s still a much better experience than passwords or answering personal questions), but they do work. Usability must be smoothed and complexity hidden, and access for the disabled, older devices, and more, has yet to be addressed.  Interoperability — Today, standards are ahead of implementations. All the players know the importance of interop but haven’t gotten there yet, though there are serious multi-org testing and development efforts underway to get it resolved. I like the alignment of incentives here: any vendor not interoperable with others will be left on its own technology island.  Communications — While these private, peer-to-peer connections can support any kind of communication, so far I’ve not seen anything other than simple messaging.  Passive Authentication — I look forward to the day when I can be authenticated by those I know and trust passively, by policy, by automatically sharing the appropriate proofs when prompted, without touching my device. As far as I know, only active authentication is now&nbsp;offered.  Embedded Agents in Door Access Readers — Another missing element is embedded SSI agents into NFC (or other tap technology) readers, to make door access compatible and performant.  Ancillary &amp; Rainy Day Use Cases — Most new tech must first nail sunny day scenarios before tackling the rainy day ones. For example, VCs could be used for guardian relationships, children, pets, things, and complex organizational hierarchies, but those haven’t been done anywhere that I’m aware of. VCs could work off-line or from a QR code on a card or piece of paper, but no one has gone there yet either, to my knowledge.  <p>Considering what’s ready today, what’s not ready, the long list of benefits for both schools and students, the fraud with existing credentials, and the possibility of eliminating existing costs (see next section), I think it adds up to a compelling case that self-sovereign student ID is ready for piloting.</p><p>That said, the pieces that enable self-sovereign student ID are nascent and only recently available; it is a new application of SSI that itself has only been around for about four years, and mostly in the lab and not much in production, though that is changing. Schools considering this in 2020 would be the first, which for those that prefer to lead rather than follow makes for a wonderful opportunity, especially during a pandemic.</p><p>Cue the <a href="https://ondigitalmarketing.com/learn/odm/foundations/5-customer-segments-technology-adoption/">Technology Adoption Lifecycle</a>… welcome, Innovators!</p> Where to&nbsp;Begin <p>To get started with self-sovereign student ID, a school needs capabilities to issue and verify VCs, and students need wallets to hold&nbsp;them.</p><p>Code for simple issuance tools is available open source, more advanced tools are offered by various SSI service providers, and standards-compliant SSI wallets are available for free in both Apple and Google app stores. Verification is the tricky part, as it requires existing school systems to be adapted to accept VCs for authentication, and later for other purposes¹. Thankfully, some IAM systems commonly found in higher ed are adaptable now:</p><p>For schools running <a href="https://www.apereo.org/projects/cas">CAS</a>, <a href="https://www.okta.com/">Okta</a>, or any IAM system that facilitates an external Identity Provider, self-sovereign student ID can be integrated relatively painlessly, enabling students to immediately use it in place of passwords, and potentially eliminating the need for a dedicated 2FA provider. For contact centers running Salesforce Service Cloud, the StudentPass product that <a href="https://www.credentialmaster.com/">Credential Master</a> is developing will integrate natively, enabling students to use their VCs to authenticate when calling in, without answering personal questions.</p><p>Of course, integrations can be made with any existing system.

 Introducing Self-Sovereign Student&nbsp;ID <blockquote>Part 1 of <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/introducing-self-sovereign-student-id-part-2-of-2-a566ed414d75">2</a>: Strong, flexible, digital student ID that’s not bound to your campus, network, or&nbsp;vendor.</blockquote><p>Full Disclosure: The benefits discussed here apply to self-sovereign student ID generally and are not specific to any vendor or product, and do not result in vendor lock-in; any standards-compliant SSI tools for issuance, holding, and verification could deliver these results. As a partner of venture studio <a href="https://digitaltrust.vc/">Digital Trust Ventures</a>, I am a co-founder of <a href="https://www.credentialmaster.com/">Credential Master</a>, a startup now developing a self-sovereign student ID&nbsp;product.</p> TL;DR:   Digital student ID: doesn’t exist yet for most students.  Self-sovereign student ID: students independently store verifiable data, and strongly prove things about themselves anywhere, online or&nbsp;off.  Many uses: strong, passwordless login, KBA-free call in, &amp; cardless walk in; secure, keyless facility and systems access; prove skills, competencies and achievements; secure peer-to-peer communication and interaction; breakthrough fraud prevention; student-controlled privacy; digitally signed consent; and&nbsp;more.  Open standards: not tied to a specific vendor, usable outside the school’s&nbsp;network.  Schools can start with self-sovereign student ID today, without waiting for collaboration with or agreement from other institutions, and without fear of vendor&nbsp;lock-in.  <p>Note: This article assumes a basic understanding of the concepts of <a href="https://sovrin.org/faq/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity (SSI)</a>, especially <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a> (VCs). The technical specifics of how VCs are issued, revoked, held, verified, and trustworthy are covered extensively across the SSI industry. Basic VC mechanics can be found in my other post: <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/how-verifiable-credentials-bridge-trust-domains-97155d0f3c17">How Verifiable Credentials Bridge Trust&nbsp;Domains</a>.</p> Digital Student&nbsp;ID <p>For most students, digital student ID still doesn’t&nbsp;exist.</p><p>I’ve been asking experts in academia what comes to mind when I say “digital student ID,” and here is what I learned: other than login credentials for a student portal — which don’t count — a digital student ID still doesn’t exist, at least not for most students in most&nbsp;schools.</p><p>The first, still obscure attempts at what I would call real digital student ID have cropped up fairly recently, enabling students to prove their identity in multiple environments and granting them access to electronic systems, software, and even physical facilities. Apple has introduced <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/08/apple-brings-contactless-student-ids-on-iphone-and-apple-watch-to-more-universities/">their version</a> of digital student ID that works exclusively with Apple software and devices, and various smaller companies have launched similarly proprietary software platforms with corresponding apps. Search “student ID” in the Apple or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/search?q=%22student%20ID%22&amp;c=apps">Google app stores</a> and you’ll find dozens of similar offerings.</p><p>So why hasn’t digital student ID caught on? I think it’s because available offerings are tied to a single vendor, usable only in systems and facilities where that vendor is installed, and verifiable only by that vendor’s app. In Apple’s case it’s tied to their hardware, too. Even a homegrown digital student ID solution can be verified only by an associated homegrown app. It is vendor lock-in to the extreme, even if that ‘vendor’ is the school&nbsp;itself.</p><p>For a school to confidently roll out a more broadly useful digital student ID, it must be with technology that can traverse boundaries between vendors, both within the school’s network and external to it, such as when a student applies for aid. Such technology now exists, and it can do a heckuva lot more than&nbsp;ID.</p><p>Introducing a powerful new model for student ID: “self-sovereign” student&nbsp;ID.</p> Self-Sovereign Student&nbsp;ID <p>You may have heard of self-sovereign identity, or SSI¹. In this article I’ll explore how self-sovereign student ID can apply SSI capabilities and principles for students, faculty, and staff in an educational environment, primarily higher education.</p><p>I recognize that the term “self-sovereign” may not resonate as well with some in academia, which is often dominated by institutions preferring to expand their scope of control and influence, and perceiving self-sovereignty as a threat. However, it is the very act of giving greater control and independence to students that yields most of the benefits listed in this article, and counter intuitively, a closer, richer relationship with those students.</p><p>I’ll discuss this more in “Why Self-Sovereign” below.</p> What Is&nbsp;It? <p>The term “self-sovereign” is unfortunately not self-explanatory, but when properly understood should feel like a familiar analog to physical identity and credentials, which we already use in a self-sovereign manner well beyond the physical and digital bounds of the organization that issued them to&nbsp;us.</p><p>In short, self-sovereign student ID gives students the ability to independently and securely store tamper-resistant, verifiable data related to themselves, and to prove things wherever they want by privately sharing cryptographic (mathematical) proofs from that data, online or off. Importantly, it also enables students to securely, directly, and privately communicate and interact with the&nbsp;school.</p><p>Technically, the student has self-sovereign control over three²&nbsp;things:</p>  A standardized digital container, for holding verifiable data;  Peer-to-peer connections between their container and the containers of other people, organizations, and&nbsp;things³;  Verifiable Credentials (VCs) that the student accepts into their wallet, and shares proofs of with others when&nbsp;desired.  <p>Today, that self-sovereign container is typically a standardized digital SSI “wallet”⁴ within a compliant app that the student can see and interact with on a smart device; eventually, wallets will be found anywhere digital things are stored and become part of the everyday life of people, organizations, and things, hidden and integrated into our devices and experiences in a way where we no longer notice or think of&nbsp;them.</p><p>One important point that will help readers better understand VCs, both in this document and generally: I believe VCs are misnamed, they are not credentials, they are verifiable containers capable of transporting any data payload, which may or may not be typically considered a “credential.” This means that VCs held in a wallet are containers within a larger container, but this is a feature, not a bug; it is how physical goods are transported in <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=meatspace">meatspace</a> and is very useful. I’ve written about these points in greater detail&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/verifiable-credentials-arent-credentials-they-re-containers-fab5b3ae5c0">here</a>.</p> Why Self-Sovereign? <p>Self-sovereignty implies giving students control over their data and how it’s shared. That may seem counter intuitive to the traditional academic notion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_loco_parentis">in loco parentis</a>, but the truth is that it not only mirrors how physical student IDs work, it simplifies the IT integration work while expanding the possible use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>Importantly, an SSI-based student ID binds the school-issued (and verifiable) information in the ID to a student’s right to use it. Through this binding, students can prove, at their own discretion, that they are enrolled, taking classes, receiving or received grades (and what they are), received a degree, and so on. Giving these facts to students in digital form can make their lives easier, reducing friction and fraud for both students and the school. ID is only one of many VCs that will be issued to the student by the school for various&nbsp;uses.</p><p>And once the student has an SSI wallet, it’s not just the school that can now exchange VCs with them. The student might want to connect and exchange VCs with multiple schools, their church, their gym club, their favorite sandwich shop or other entities they interact with. You might think that sounds like an Apple or Samsung wallet, and it kinda does,&nbsp;except:</p>  SSI wallets are portable between vendors, devices, and device types (ie, move from iPhone to Samsung and back&nbsp;again)  VCs are portable between&nbsp;wallets  VCs can hold any kind of data (ie, identity, location, degree, favorite&nbsp;pizza)  VCs are cryptographically verifiable  Holders can share only part of a VC, metadata about a VC, or just proof that they have one, without revealing anything&nbsp;else  The protocols that make wallets and VCs portable and interoperable are open and standardized  <p>And of course, Apple and Android wallets don’t enable persistent, encrypted connections with other people, organizations and things for secure peer-to-peer communication and interaction, but I’m getting ahead of&nbsp;myself…</p> A Thousand&nbsp;Uses <p>By “useful” I mean it can be used for many important, new, relevant purposes and also make expected and ordinary uses&nbsp;better.</p><p>I’ll organize the usefulness of self-sovereign student ID into six categories:</p>  Identity &amp;&nbsp;Access  Achievements, Skills, &amp; Competencies  The “Digital Experience”  Privileges, Perks &amp;&nbsp;Freebies  Communication &amp; Interaction  Preventing Fraud &amp;&nbsp;Phishing  <p>The first category, Identity &amp; Access, will be covered within this Part 1 and is where I’ll delve the most deeply. I’ll touch on the remaining categories in <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/introducing-self-sovereign-student-id-part-2-of-2-a566ed414d75">Part&nbsp;2</a>.</p><p>Note: As mentioned above, it is outside the scope of this article to explain the basic mechanics of SSI and VC exchange, such as how the initial encrypted connections are offered and accepted, how VCs are offered and accepted using those connections, how VC presentation and verification occurs, or how those verifications can be trustworthy. Those subjects are covered amply by many other documents, papers, and websites throughout the SSI industry, and are the reason for the industry’s abundant standards activity. Refer to links at the beginning of this article for more information.</p> Identity &amp;&nbsp;Access <p>The primary use of self-sovereign student ID — and the gateway to limitless other uses — is as a digital, and therefore more powerful, version of a student ID card, enabling students to instantly and strongly prove their identity and status as a student, online or off, without passwords.</p> Password Replacement <p>Perhaps the simplest starting point for self-sovereign student ID is to replace passwords. Passwords have many known problems with both security and UX, and can be replaced with a quick ping to a student’s smartphone. The student responds with a tap, which cryptographically shares their school-issued ID, which is instantly verifiable by the&nbsp;school.</p><p>This is a big step-up in both security and user experience over passwords, and social login, and can be used in conjunction with or as a substitute for&nbsp;2FA.</p><p>For schools running CAS, Okta, or any ID system supportive of a “custom IDP” or “external authentication handler,” password replacement can be implemented quickly.</p> Identity+ <p>Self-sovereign student ID starts with a student-controlled wallet into which the school can issue VCs containing any kind of data, identity or otherwise. So typical student ID data — name, photo, ID number, etc. — can be supplemented with any other desired information: classes registered for or taken, status and authority as a student leader, entitlements, permissions, preferences, allergies, relationships to other students, contact information, family information, achievements (more on that below), and on and&nbsp;on.</p> Multi-Factor Authentication+ (MFA+) <p>The plus in MFA+ means the ability to exchange more factors than is feasible with current tech, while not impairing the user experience, and likely improving it.</p><p>Because shared secrets (something the student knows, like a username or password) are replaced with cryptographically secure, digitally signed VCs (something the student has, like a unique key), you can exchange much stronger credentials than passwords. Because they’re digital and easily shared, you can exchange more of them, even dozens. Biometrics, location and more can also be incorporated, either as payloads within VCs or in conjunction with&nbsp;them.</p><p>Because VCs can be exchanged actively or passively behind the scenes, they are useful within <a href="https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cyberpedia/what-is-a-zero-trust-architecture">Zero Trust Architecture</a> (ZTA). For higher-risk applications, multiple signatures can be required from multiple devices and/or multiple individuals. Combining MFA+, ZTA, and multi-device and multi-signature capabilities results in a formidable approach to protecting sensitive systems and facilities.</p> Vendor Independence <p>SSI is based on standards, so tools from different vendors can be interoperable. This means that your school isn’t locked into a single vendor and can replace a vendor without reissuing IDs (try that with a traditional ID system). Students, faculty, and staff can choose from multiple wallets to store their credentials, which are portable if they later decide to switch. You might use one vendor to help issue student IDs, another to integrate with the student information system for registration and transcript data, and a third to verify student or staff status at the campus bookstore POS. You don’t have to worry that any vendor selected for digital student IDs can’t support your diverse campus needs, or that you’re stuck with lousy quality or&nbsp;service.</p><p>Use of student ID becomes no longer constrained digitally or physically by the boundaries of the school’s trust domain, or the presence of any particular vendor, removing what I believe is the #1 barrier for digital student ID adoption&nbsp;today.</p> Digital First, Then&nbsp;Physical <p>Self-sovereign student ID is digital first, but not digital only. With self-sovereign student ID you can have both digital and physical forms in several varieties.</p><p>A ‘smart’/chipped student ID card could hold an SSI wallet (note the irony) with some of a student’s VCs, greatly expanding the types of credentials, entitlements, tickets or other items the student can carry and benefit from, and making it much harder for a fraudster to get away with swapping out the name, photo, ID number,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>A student could also present a card or a paper with a QR code on it. Scanning the QR code could pull up a verified student ID, including a photo, either from a school-controlled database or from student-controlled storage. QR code-based verification could be restricted to authorized personnel, who could also be required to digitally prove their ID before gaining&nbsp;access.</p><p>Combining these capabilities, a school could issue a physical ID card with only three elements: a photo, a QR code, and an embedded chip— no name, no ID number, nothing else. If the chip and QR code worked as described above, even this extreme approach could be more useful than existing student ID cards while being more private for students and more difficult to hack for fraudsters.</p> Access+ <p>Whether for accessing digital systems, physical facilities or events, self-sovereign student ID can begin to support digital versions of key cards, vouchers, receipts and more, all uniquely associated with the student. A VC can also be issued as a bearer instrument not associated with any individual, like a movie ticket or a coupon. Using geofencing, students could be passively authenticated when entering a secure area, of course subject to their consent to the practice.</p> Mutual Authentication <p>Because it enables a bi-directional exchange of VCs, self-sovereign student ID may be the first technology that enables students to authenticate schools as strongly as schools authenticate students, preventing impersonation and phishing.</p> User Experience <p>Who doesn’t want fewer usernames and passwords to deal with? With self-sovereign student ID, the student can digitally present their ID and other entitlements and be authenticated more strongly, safely, and quickly than with usernames and passwords. This reduces the incidence of fraud, account take-over, and password reset requests.</p><p>Because the school maintains a secure, peer-to-peer connection with the student, it can use this connection to prompt the student for ID when the student calls in or walks in⁵. When calling in, this eliminates the need for knowledge-based authentication questions (birthday, mother’s maiden name, etc.) and speeds up the call; when walking in, this eliminates the need to pull out a physical student ID (useful during a pandemic).</p><p>Whether calling in, walking in, or logging in, a student can feel recognized by the school rather than repeatedly treated as a stranger.</p> Privacy &amp; Compliance <p>Today, when presenting a physical student ID card, the student divulges everything on it; there’s no way to present only part of it. With <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/a-solution-for-privacy-preserving-verifiable-credentials-f1650aa16093">selective disclosure</a> enabled by self-sovereign student ID, a student can share only the data required and nothing more, or prove something about their credentials without disclosing any of the data, or just prove that they have it. Some examples are&nbsp;helpful:</p>  Prove status as a currently enrolled student, without revealing name, ID number, or other personal&nbsp;info  Prove age is over a threshold, without revealing actual age or&nbsp;birthday  Prove address on file is within a certain area, city, or building, without revealing the exact&nbsp;location  <p>Selective disclosure is useful for many things, including voting, and can be used online or off. It affords whatever level of privacy the student desires, and satisfies both the spirit and the letter of aggressive privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA, while remaining auditable for all interactions between students and the school. And by minimizing the presentation of identity to only the attributes needed, selective disclosure curtails the unchecked growth in the ‘grey market’ of personal data, worth billions of dollars and&nbsp;growing.</p><p>And when data is shared, it is shared directly by the student with digitally signed evidence that they did so, a veritable get-out-of-jail free card in today’s PII-sensitive privacy&nbsp;climate.</p> Consolidation &amp; Simplification <p>As it scales, federated ID has a tendency to grow into a complex, tangled web of identities, identifiers, vendors, integrations, synchronizations, and registries. Self-sovereign student ID can begin a process of consolidation around a coherent identity meta system, with a reduction in vendors, a reduction in identifiers, and an overall reduction in complexity, without consolidating around a single&nbsp;vendor.</p><p>And that’s not a&nbsp;joke.</p><p>That said, I’m taking the advice of my business partner, SSI pioneer <a href="https://digitaltrust.vc/team-and-contact/">Dr. Sam Smith</a>, and avoiding diving into how this can occur within this piece. He is the better author for it anyway, as it quickly gets into a technical discussion about self-certifying identifiers, which SSI uses, versus administrative identifiers, which federated ID uses, which is his area of study and expertise. So, Sam can write a separate piece if there is sufficient interest. For readers having a pressing need related to this topic, please get in&nbsp;touch.</p> ID Is the Low-Hanging Fruit <p>For most, ID may be the best place to start with VCs. There’s far less complexity than something like achievements, and no other entities need to be consulted before adopting a particular approach; a school catches what it pitches. Plus, the benefits can be broadly and immediately felt, and readily integrated into most IAM systems. And of course, ID is a prerequisite for most other use cases; even if those feel more important or urgent, you usually need to begin by verifying who you’re dealing&nbsp;with.</p><p>If you read no further, this should already be apparent: though ID and Access may be a fraction of what self-sovereign student ID can do, it is more than enough to justify serious consideration. The uses discussed in <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/introducing-self-sovereign-student-id-part-2-of-2-a566ed414d75">Part 2</a> are cool and exciting, but just icing on the&nbsp;cake.</p><p>If you’re not planning to read Part 2 and are wondering how to operationalize self-sovereign student ID, open <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/introducing-self-sovereign-student-id-part-2-of-2-a566ed414d75">Part 2</a> and skip down to “Where to&nbsp;Begin.”</p><blockquote><a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/introducing-self-sovereign-student-id-part-2-of-2-a566ed414d75">Part 2: ID is Only the Beginning</a></blockquote><p>¹ One of the earliest/best pieces about SSI, from Christopher Allen: <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html</a></p><p>² Technically there is a fourth thing a student controls: self-certifying identifiers provide the root of trust, the crypto magic that makes it possible to traverse trust domain boundaries, but they’re “deeper under the hood” and out of scope for this piece.

<p>I released <a href="https://sqitch.org/">Sqitch</a> v<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/DWHEELER/App-Sqitch-0.9998" title="App-Sqitch v0.9998">0.9998</a> this week. Despite the <a href="https://metacpan.org/source/DWHEELER/App-Sqitch-0.9998/Changes" title="Sqitch v0.9998 Changes">long list of changes</a>,
only one new feature stands out: support for the <a href="https://www.snowflake.net/">Snowflake Data Warehouse</a>
platform. A major <a href="https://iovation.com/" title="iovation, Inc.">work</a> project aims to move all of our reporting data from
Postgres to Snowflake. I asked the team lead if they needed Sqitch support, and
they said something like, “Oh hell yes, that would save us months of
work!” Fortunately I had time to make it happen.</p>
<p>Snowflake’s SQL interface ably supports all the functionality required for
Sqitch; indeed, the <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/sqitch/blob/master/lib/App/Sqitch/Engine/snowflake.pm" title="App::Sqitch::Engine::snowflake">implementation</a> required fairly little customization. And
while I did report a number of issues and shortcomings to the Snowflake support
team, they always responded quickly and helpfully — sometimes revealing
undocumented workarounds to solve my problems. I requested that they be
documented.</p>
<p>The work turned out well. If you use Snowflake, consider managing your databases
with Sqitch. Start with <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/sqitchtutorial-snowflake" title="A tutorial introduction to Sqitch change management on Snowflake">the tutorial</a> to get a feel for it.</p>
 Bundle Up 
<p>Of course, you might find it a little tricky to get started. In addition to long
list of Perl dependencies, each database engines requires two external
resources: a command-line client and a driver library. For Snowflake, that means
the <a href="https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/user-guide/snowsql.html" title="SnowSQL Client for Snowflake">SnowSQL</a> client and the <a href="https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/user-guide/odbc.html" title="ODBC Driver for Snowflake">ODBC driver</a>. The PostgreSQL engine requires
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-psql.html">psql</a> and <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/DBD::Pg">DBD::Pg</a> compiled with <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/libpq.html">libpq</a>. MySQL calls for the <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysql.html">mysql client</a>
and <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/DBD::mysql">DBD::mysql</a> compiled with the MySQL connection library. And so on. You
likely don’t care what needs to be built and installed; you just want it to
work. Ideally install a binary and go.</p>
<p>I do, too. So I spent the a month or so building Sqitch bundling support, to
easily install all its Perl dependencies into a single directory for
distribution as a single package. It took a while because, sadly, Perl provides
no straightforward method to build such a feature without also bundling unneeded
libraries. I plan to write up the technical details soon; for now, just know
that I made it work. If you <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>, you’ll reap the benefits in your next
<code>brew install sqitch</code>.</p>
 Pour One Out 
<p>In fact, the bundling feature enabled a complete rewrite of the <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/homebrew-sqitch">Sqitch Homebrew
tap</a>. Previously, Sqitch’s Homebrew formula installed the required modules in
Perl’s global include path. This pattern violated Homebrew best practices, which
prefer that all the dependencies for an app, aside from configuration, reside in
a single directory, or “cellar.”</p>
<p>The new formula follows this dictum, bundling Sqitch and its CPAN dependencies
into a nice, neat package. Moreover, it enables engine dependency selection at
build time. Gone are the separate <code>sqitch_$engine</code> formulas. Just pass the
requisite options when you build Sqitch:</p>
  <code>brew install sqitch --with-postgres-support --with-sqlite-support
</code>  <p>Include as many engines as you need (<a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/homebrew-sqitch#supported-database-engines" title="Sqitch Homebrew: Supported Database Engines">here’s the list</a>). Find yourself with only
Postgres support but now need Oracle, too? Just reinstall:</p>
  <code>export HOMEBREW_ORACLE_HOME=$ORACLE_HOME
brew reinstall sqitch --with-postgres-support --with-oracle-support
</code>  <p>In fact, the old <code>sqitch_oracle</code> formula hasn’t worked in quite some time, but
the new <code>$HOMEBREW_ORACLE_HOME</code> environment variable does the trick (provided
you <a href="https://www.imore.com/how-turn-system-integrity-protection-macos">disable SIP</a>; see <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/homebrew-sqitch/#--with-oracle-support" title="Sqitch Homebrew Oracle support">the instructions</a> for details).</p>
<p>I recently became a Homebrew user myself, and felt it important to make Sqitch
build “the right way”. I expect this formula to be more reliable and better
maintained going forward.</p>
<p>Still, despite its utility, Homebrew Sqitch lives up to its name: It downloads
and builds Sqitch from source. To attract newbies with a quick and easy method
to get started, we need something even simpler.</p>
 Dock of the Bae 
<p>Which brings me to the installer that excites me most: The new <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/sqitch/sqitch/" title="Sqitch on Docker Hub">Docker image</a>.
Curious about Sqitch and want to download and go? Use Docker? Try this:</p>
 <code>curl -L https://git.io/JJKCn -o sqitch &amp;&amp; chmod +x sqitch
./sqitch help
</code> <p>That’s it. On first run, <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/docker-sqitch/blob/master/docker-sqitch.sh" title="Sqitch Docker Shell Script">the script</a> pulls down the Docker image, which
includes full support for PostgreSQL, MySQL, Firebird, and SQLite, and weighs in
at just 164 MB (54 MB compressed). Thereafter, it works just as if Sqitch was
locally-installed. It uses a few tricks to achieve this bit of magic:</p>
 
 It mounts the current directory, so it acts on the Sqitch project you
intend it to 
 It mounts your home directory, so it can read the usual configuration files 
 It syncs the <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/sqitch-environment" title="Environment variables recognized by Sqitch">environment variables</a> that Sqitch cares about 
 
<p>The script even syncs your username, full name, and host name, in case you
haven’t configured your name and email address with <a href="http://metacpan.org/pod/sqitch-config"><code>sqitch config</code></a>. The only
outwardly obvious difference is the editor:<a>1</a> If you add
a change and let the editor open, it launches <a href="https://www.nano-editor.org" title="Nano Text Editor">nano</a> rather than your preferred
editor. This limitation allows the image ot remain as small as possible.</p>
<p>I invested quite a lot of effort into the Docker image, to make it as small as
possible while maximizing out-of-the-box database engine support — without
foreclosing support for proprietary databases. To that end, the <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/docker-sqitch" title="Sqitch Docker Packaging on GitHub">repository</a>
already contains <code>Dockerfile</code>s to support <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/docker-sqitch/tree/master/oracle/" title="Sqitch Oracle Docker instructions">Oracle</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/docker-sqitch/tree/master/snowflake/" title="Sqitch Snowflake Docker instructions">Snowflake</a>: simply
download the required binary files, built the image, and push it to your private
registry. Then set <code>$SQITCH_IMAGE</code> to the image name to transparently run it
with the magic <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/docker-sqitch/blob/master/docker-sqitch.sh" title="Sqitch Docker Shell Script">shell script</a>.</p>
 Docker Docket 
<p>I plan to put more work into the Sqitch Docker repository over the next few
months. <a href="https://www.exasol.com/">Exasol</a> and <a href="https://my.vertica.com/">Vertica</a> <code>Dockerfile</code>s come next. Beyond that, I envision
matrix of different images, one for each database engine, to minimize download
and runtime size for folx who need only one engine — especially for production
deployments. Adding <a href="https://alpinelinux.org/" title="Alpine Linux">Alpine</a>-based images also tempts me; they’d be even
smaller, though unable to support most (all?) of the commercial database
engines. Still: tiny!</p>
<p>Container size obsession is a thing, right?</p>
<p>At <a href="https://iovation.com/" title="iovation, Inc.">work</a>, we believe the future of app deployment and execution belongs to
containerization, particularly on Docker and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>. I presume that
conviction will grant me time to work on these improvements.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Well, that and connecting to a service on your
host machine is a little fussy. For example, to use Postgres on your local
host, you can’t connect to Unix sockets. The <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/docker-sqitch/blob/master/docker-sqitch.sh" title="Sqitch Docker Shell Script">shell script</a>
enables <a href="https://docs.docker.com/network/host/" title="Docker documentation: “Use host networking”">host networking</a>, so on Linux, at least, you should be able to
connect to <code>localhost</code> to deploy your changes. On <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/networking/#use-cases-and-workarounds" title="Docker documentation: “Networking features in Docker for Mac”">macOS</a> and <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/networking/#use-cases-and-workarounds" title="Docker documentation: “Networking features in Docker for Windows”">Windows</a>, use
the <code>host.docker.internal</code> host name. <a>↩︎</a></p>

  <p>This week I've been working on making Datasette easier to install, plus wide-ranging improvements to the Datasette GraphQL plugin.</p>
 Datasette and Homebrew 
<p>Datasette is now part of the <a href="https://github.blog/2020-05-06-new-from-satellite-2020-github-codespaces-github-discussions-securing-code-in-private-repositories-and-more/#discussions">GitHub Discussions</a> beta - which means the GitHub repository for the project now has a <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/discussions">Datasette discussions area</a>. I've been wanting to set up somewhere to talk about the project free of pressure to file issues or bug reports for a while, so I'm really excited to have this as a new community space.</p>
<p>One of the first threads there was about <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/discussions/921">Making Datasette easier to install</a>. This inspired me to finally take a look at <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/335">issue #335</a> from July 2018 - "Package datasette for installation using homebrew".</p>
<p>I used the <a href="https://github.com/saulpw/homebrew-vd">VisiData Homebrew Tap</a> as a starting point, along with Homebrew's <a href="https://docs.brew.sh/Python-for-Formula-Authors">Python for Formula Authors</a> documentation. To cut a long story short, <code>brew install datasette</code> now works!</p>
<p>I wrote up some detailed notes on <a href="https://github.com/simonw/til/blob/main/homebrew/packaging-python-cli-for-homebrew.md">Packaging a Python CLI tool for Homebrew</a>. I've also had my <a href="https://sqlite-utils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cli.html">sqlite-utils CLI tool</a> accepted into Homebrew, so you can now install that using <code>brew install sqlite-utils</code> as well.</p>
 datasette install, datasette uninstall 
<p>The updated <a href="https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html">Datasette installation instructions</a> now feature a range of different options: Homebrew, <code>pip</code>, <code>pipx</code> and Docker.</p>
<p><a href="https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/stable/plugins.html">Datasette Plugins</a> need to be installed into the same Python environment as Datasette itself. If you installed Datasette using <code>pipx</code> or Homebrew figuring out which environment that is isn't particularly straight-forward.</p>
<p>So I added two new commands to Datasette (released in <a href="https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-47">Datasette 0.47</a>): <code>datasette install name-of-plugin</code> and <code>datasette uninstall name-of-plugin</code>. These are very thin wrappers around the underlying <code>pip</code>, but with the crucial improvement that they guarantee they'll run it in the correct environment. I derived another TIL from these on <a href="https://github.com/simonw/til/blob/main/python/call-pip-programatically.md">How to call pip programatically from Python</a>.</p>
 datasette --get "/-/versions.json" 
<p>Part of writing a Homebrew package is defining <a href="https://github.com/simonw/til/blob/main/homebrew/packaging-python-cli-for-homebrew.md#implementing-the-test-block">a test block</a> that confirms that the packaged tool is working correctly.</p>
<p>I didn't want that test to have to start a Datasette web server just so it could execute an HTTP request and shut the server down again, so I added a new feature: <a href="https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started.html#datasette-get">datasette --get</a>.</p>
<p>This is a mechanism that lets you execute a fake HTTP GET request against Datasette without starting the server, and outputs the result to the terminal.</p>
<p>This means that anything you can do with the Datasette JSON API is now available on the command-line as well!</p>
<p>I like piping the output to <code>jq</code> to get pretty-printed JSON:</p>
 <code>% datasette github.db --get \
    '/github/recent_releases.json?_shape=array&amp;_size=1' | jq
[
  {
    "rowid": 140912432,
    "repo": "https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils",
    "release": "https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils/releases/tag/2.15",
    "date": "2020-08-10"
  }
]</code> 
 datasette-graphql improvements 
<p>I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Aug/7/datasette-graphql/">introduced datasette-graphql</a> last week. I shipped five new releases since then, incorporating feedback from GraphQL advocates on Twitter.</p>
<p>The most significant improvement: I've redesigned the filtering mechanism to be much more in line with GraphQL conventions. The old syntax looked like this:</p>
 <code>{
  repos(filters: ["license=apache-2.0", "stargazers_count__gt=10"]) {
    edges {
      node {
        full_name
      }
    }
  }
}</code> 
<p>This mirrored how Datasette's table page works (e.g. <a href="https://datasette-graphql-demo.datasette.io/github/repos?license=apache-2.0&amp;stargazers_count__gt=10">repos?license=apache-2.0&amp;stargazers_count__gt=10</a>), but it's a pretty ugly hack.</p>
<p>The new syntax is much, much nicer:</p>
 <code>{
  repos(filter: {license: {eq: "apache-2.0"}, stargazers_count: {gt: 10}}) {
    edges {
      node {
        full_name
      }
    }
  }
}</code> 
<p><a href="https://datasette-graphql-demo.datasette.io/graphql?query=%7B%0A%20%20repos(filter%3A%20%7Blicense%3A%20%7Beq%3A%20%22apache-2.0%22%7D%2C%20stargazers_count%3A%20%7Bgt%3A%2010%7D%7D)%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20edges%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20node%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20full_name%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%7D%0A%20%20%20%20%7D%0A%20%20%7D%0A%7D%0A">Execute this query</a>.</p>
<p>The best part of this syntax is that the columns and operations are part of the GraphQL schema, which means tools like GraphiQL can provide auto-completion for them interactively as you type a query.</p>
<p>Another new feature: <code>tablename_row</code> can be used to return an individual row (actually the first matching item for its arguments). This is a convenient way to access rows by their primary key, since the primary key columns automatically become GraphQL arguments:</p>
 <code>{
  users_row(id: 9599) {
    id
    name
    contributors_list(first: 5) {
      totalCount
      nodes {
        repo_id {
          full_name
        }
        contributions
      }
    }
  } 
}</code> 
<p><a href="https://datasette-graphql-demo.datasette.io/graphql?query=%7B%0A%20%20users_row(id%3A%209599)%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20id%0A%20%20%20%20name%0A%20%20%20%20contributors_list(first%3A%205)%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20totalCount%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20nodes%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20repo_id%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20full_name%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%7D%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20contributions%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%7D%0A%20%20%20%20%7D%0A%20%20%7D%20%0A%7D%0A">Try that query here</a>.</p>
<p>There are plenty more improvements to the plugin detailed in the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/releases">datasette-graphql changelog</a>.</p>
 Write-ahead logging in SQLite 
<p>SQLite's <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html">Write-Ahead Logging</a> feature improves concurrency by preventing writes from blocking reads. I was seeing the occasional "database is locked" error with my personal <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/dogsheep/">Dogsheep</a> so I decided to finally figure out how turn this on for a database.</p>
<p>The breakthrough realization for me (thanks to a question I asked <a href="https://sqlite.org/forum/forumpost/c4dbf6ca17">on the SQLite forum</a>) was that WAL mode is a characteristic of the database file itself. Once you've turned it on for the file, all future connections to that file will take advantage of it.</p>
<p>I wrote about this in a TIL: <a href="https://github.com/simonw/til/blob/main/sqlite/enabling-wal-mode.md">Enabling WAL mode for SQLite database files</a>. I also embedded what I learned in <a href="https://sqlite-utils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v2-15">sqlite-utils 2.15</a>, which now includes <code>sqlite-utils enable-wal file.db</code> and <code>sqlite-utils disable-wal file.db</code> commands (and accompanying Python API methods).</p>
 Datasette 0.46, with a security fix 
<p>Earlier this week I also released <a href="https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-46">Datasette 0.46</a>, with the key feature being a security fix relating to canned queries and CSRF protection.</p>
<p>I used GitHub's security advisory mechanism for this one: <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/security/advisories/GHSA-q6j3-c4wc-63vw">CSRF tokens leaked in URL by canned query form</a>. I've also included detailed information on the exploit (and the fix) in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/918">issue #918</a>.</p>
<p>Also new in 0.46: the <a href="https://latest.datasette.io/-/allow-debug">/-/allow-debug tool</a>, which can be used to experiment with Datasette's <a href="https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/stable/authentication.html#defining-permissions-with-allow-blocks">allow blocks</a> permissions mechanism.</p>

  <p>Summary: Self-sovereign identity, supported by a heterarchical identity metasystem, creates a firm foundation for rich digital relationships that allow people to be digitally embodied so they can act online as autonomous agents.</p>


<a></a>

<p>
    An earlier blog post, <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml">Relationships and Identity</a> proposed that we build digital identity systems to create and manage relationships—not identities—and discussed the nature of digital relationships in terms of their integrity, lifespan, and utility. You should read that post before this one. 
</p>

<p>
    In his article <a href="https://medium.com/@trbouma/architecture-eats-culture-eats-strategy-925c7f3fb74b">Architecture Eats Culture Eats Strategy</a>, Tim Bouma makes the point that the old management chestnut <a href="https://www.managementcentre.co.uk/culture-eats-strategy-for-breakfast/">Culture Eats Strategy</a> leaves open the question: how do we change the culture. Tim's point is that architecture (in the general sense) is the upstream predator to culture. Architecture is a powerful force that drives culture and therefore determines what strategies will succeed—or, more generally, what use cases are possible. 
</p>

<p>
    Following on Tim's insight, my thesis is that identity systems are the foundational layer of our digital ecosystem and therefore the architecture of digital identity systems drives online culture and ultimately what we can do and what we can't. Specifically, since <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml">identity systems are built to create and manage relationships</a>, their architecture deeply impacts the kinds of relationships they support. And the quality of those relationships determines whether or not we live effective lives in the digital sphere. 
</p>

 Administrative Identity Systems Create Anemic Relationships 

<p>
    I was the founder and CTO of iMall, an early, pioneering ecommerce tools vendor. As early as 1996 we determined that we not only needed a shopping cart that kept track of a shopper's purchases in a single session, but one that knew who the shopper was from visit to visit so we could keep the shopping cart and pre-fill forms with shipping and billing addresses. Consequently, we built an identity system. In the spirit of the early web, it was a one-off, written in Perl and storing personal data in Berkeley DB. We did hash the passwords—we weren't idiots1. 
</p>

<p>
    Early Web companies had a problem: we needed to know things about people and there was no reliable way for them to tell us who they were. So everyone built an identity system and thus began my and your journey to collecting thousands of identifiers as the Web expanded and every single site needed it's own way to know things about us.
</p>

<p>
    Administrative identity systems, as these kinds of identity systems are called, create a relationship between the organization operating the identity system and the people who are their customers, citizens, partners, and so on. They are, federation notwithstanding, largely self contained and put the administrator at the center as shown in Figure 1. This is their fundamental architecture. 
</p>


	  <a></a>
	  Figure 1: Administrative identity systems put the administrator at the center.   (click to enlarge)


<p>
    Administrative identity systems are owned. They are closed. They are run for the purposes of their owners, not the purposes of the people or things being administered. They provision and permission. They are bureaucracies for governing something. They rely on rules, procedures, and formal interaction patterns. Need a new password? Be sure to follow the password rules of what ever administrative system you're in. Fail to follow the company's terms of service? You could lose your account without recourse. 
</p>

<p>
    Administrative identity systems use a simple schema, containing just the attributes that the administrator needs to serve their purposes and reduce risk. The problem I and others were solving back in the 90's was legibility2. Legibility is a term used to describe how administrative systems make things governable by simplifying, inventorying, and rationalizing things around them. Identity systems make people legible in order to offer them continuity and convenience while reducing risk for the administrator. 
</p>

<p>
    Administrative identity systems give rise to a systematic inequality in the relationships they manage. Administrative identity systems create bureaucratic cultures. Every interaction you have online happens under the watchful eye of a bureaucracy built to govern the system and the people using it. The bureaucracy may be benevolent, benign, or malevolent but it controls the interaction. 
</p>

<p>
    Designers of administrative identity systems do the imaginative work of assigning identifiers, defining the administrative schemas and processes, and setting the purpose of the identity system and the relationships it engenders. Because of the systematic imbalance of power that administrative identity systems create, administrators can afford to be lazy. To the administrator, everyone is structurally the same, being fit into the same schema. This is efficient because they can afford to ignore all the qualities that make people unique and concentrate on just their business. Meanwhile subjects are left to perform the "interpretive labor" as <a href="https://www.haujournal.org/index.php/hau/article/view/hau2.2.007%22">David Graeber calls it</a> of understanding the system, what it allows or doesn't, and how it can be bent to accomplish their goals.  Subjects have few tools for managing these relationship because each one is a little different, not only technically, but procedurally as well. There is no common protocol or user experience. Consequently, subjects have no way to operationalize the relationship except in whatever manner the administrator allows. 
</p>

<p>
    Given that the architecture of administrative identity systems gives rise to a bureaucratic culture, what kinds of strategies or capabilities does that culture engender? Quoting <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Utopia-Rules-Technology-Stupidity-Bureaucracy-ebook/dp/B00MKZ0QZ2/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=utopia+of+rules&amp;qid=1596487542&amp;sr=8-1">David Graeber from The Utopia of Rules (pg 152)</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>Cold, impersonal, bureaucratic relations are much like cash transactions, and both offer similar advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand they are soulless. On the other, they are simple, predictable, and—within certain parameters, at least—treat everyone more or less the same.
</blockquote>

<p>
    I argue that this is the kind of thing the internet is best at. Our online relationships with ecommerce companies, social media providers, banks, and others are cold and impersonal, but also relatively efficient. In that sense, the web has kept its promise. But the institutionalized frame of action that has come to define it alienates its subjects in two ways:
</p>
 
     They are isolated and estranged from each other. 
     They surrender control over their online activity and the associated data within a given domain to the administrator of that domain.  
 

<p>
    The administrative architecture and the bureaucratic culture it creates has several unavoidable, regrettable outcomes:
</p>
 
     Anemic relationships that limit the capabilities of the systems they support. For example, social media platforms are designed to allow people to form a link (symmetrical or asymmetrical) to others online. But it is all done within the sphere of the administrative domain of the system provider. The relationships in these systems are like two-dimensional cardboard cutouts of the real relationships they mirror. We inhabit multiple walled gardens that no more reflect real life than do the walled gardens of amusement parks.
     
     A surveillance economy that relies on the weak privacy provisions that administrative systems create to exploit our online behavior as the raw material for products that not only predict, but attempt to manipulate, our future behaviors.3 Many administrative relationships are set up to harvest data about our online behavior. The administrator controls the nature of these relationships, what is allowed, and what is behavior is rewarded.
     
     Single points of failure where key parts of our lives are contained within the systems of companies that will inevitably cease to exist someday.  In the words of <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/07/its_the_autonomy_stupid.shtml">Craig Burton</a>: "It's about choice: freedom of choice vs. prescribed options. Leadership shifts. Policies expire. Companies fail. Systems decay. Give me the freedom of choice to minimize these hazards." 
 

 The Self-Sovereign Alternative 

<p>
    <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/06/what_is_ssi.shtml">Self-sovereign identity (SSI) systems</a> offers an alternative model that supports richer relationships. Rather than provisioning identifiers and accounts in an administrative system where the power imbalance assures that one party to the relationship can dictate the terms of the interaction, SSI is founded on peer relationships that are co-provisioned by the exchange of decentralized identifiers. This architecture implies that both parties will have tools that speak a common protocol. 
</p>



	  <a></a>
	  Figure 2: Self-Sovereign Identity Stack (click to enlarge)


<p>
    Figure 2 shows the self-sovereign identity stack. The bottom two layers, the Verifiable Data Repositories and the Peer-to-Peer Agents make up what we refer to as the Identity Metasystem. The features of the metasystem architecture are our primary interest. I have written extensively about the details of the architecture of the metasystem in other posts (see <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/03/the_sovrin_ssi_stack.shtml">The Sovrin SSI Stack</a> and <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/02/decentralized_identifiers.shtml">Decentralized Identifiers</a>). 
</p>

<p>
    The architecture of the metasystem has several important features:
</p>
 
     
        Mediated by protocol—Instead of being intermediated by an intervening administrative authority, activities in the metasystem are mediated through peer-to-peer protocol. Protocols are the foundation of interoperability and allow for scale. Protocols describe the rules for a set of interactions, specifying the kinds of interactions that can happen without being overly prescriptive about their nature or content. Consequently, the metasystem supports a flexible set of interactions that can be adapted for many different contexts and needs.
     
     Heterarchical—Interactions in the metasystem are peer-to-peer rather than hierarchical. The are <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2015/01/re-imagining_decentralized_and_distributed.shtml">not just distributed, but decentralized</a>. Decentralization <a>enables autonomy and flexibility</a> and to assure its independence from the influence of any single actor. No centralized system can anticipate all the various use cases. And no single actor should be allowed to determine who uses the system or for what purposes.
     
     
        Consistent user experience—A consistent user experience doesn’t mean a single user interface. Rather the focus is on the experience. As an example, consider an automobile. My grandfather, who died in 1955, could get in a modern car and, with only a little instruction, successfully drive it. Consistent user experiences let people know what to expect so they can intuitively understand how to interact in any given situation regardless of context.
     
     
        Polymorphic—The information we need in any given relationship varies widely with context. The content that an identity metasystem carries must be flexible enough to support many different situations. 
     
 

<p>
    These architectural features give rise to a culture that I describe as protocological. The protocological culture of the identity metasystem has the following properties:
</p>
 
     Open and permissionless—The metasystem has the same three virtues of the Internet that <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/">Doc Searls</a> and <a href="http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/">Dave Weinberger</a>  <a href="http://www.worldofends.com/#BM_8">enumerated</a>: No one owns it, everyone can use it, and anyone can improve it. Special care is taken to ensure that the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/05/the_impact_of_a_network_of_networks_on_censorship.shtml">metasystem is censorship resistant</a> so that everyone has access. The protocols and code that enable the metasystem are open source and available for review and improvement. 
     
     <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/agentic">Agentic</a>—The metasystem allows allows people to act as autonomous agents, under their <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/cogito_ergo_sum.shtml">self-sovereign authority</a>. The most vital value proposition of self-sovereign identity is autonomy—not being inside someone else's administrative system where they make the rules in a one sided way. Autonomy requires that participants interact as peers in the system, which the architecture of the metasystem supports.
     
     Inclusive—Inclusivity is more than being open and permissionless. Inclusivity requires design that ensures people are not left behind. For example, some people cannot act for themselves for legal (e.g. minors) or other (e.g. refugees) reasons. Support for <a href="https://sovrin.org/guardianship/">digital guardianship</a> ensures that those who cannot act for themselves can still participate. 
     
     Flexible—The metasystem allows people to select appropriate service providers and features. No single system can anticipate all the scenarios that will be required for billions of individuals to live their own effective lives. A metasystem allows for context-specific scenarios.
     
     Modular—An identity metasystem can’t be a single, centralized system from a single vendor with limited pieces and parts. Rather, the metasystem will have interchangeable parts, built and operated by various parties. Protocols and standards enable this. Modularity supports substitutability, a key factor in autonomy and flexibility.
     
     Universal—Successful protocols eat other protocols until only one survives. An identity metasystem based on protocol will have network effects that drive interoperability leading to universality. This doesn't mean that one organization will have control, it means that one protocol will mediate all interaction and everyone in the ecosystem will conform to it. 
     
 

 Supporting Authentic Relationships 
<p>
    Self-sovereign identity envisions digital life that cannot be supported with traditional identity architectures. The architecture of self-sovereign identity and the culture that springs from it support richer, more authentic relationships:
</p>

 
     Self-sovereign identity provides people with the means of operationalizing their online relationships by providing them the tools for acting online as peers and managing the relationships they enter into.  
     Self-sovereign identity, through protocol, allows ad hoc interactions that were not or cannot be imagined a priori. 
 
<p>
    The following subsections give examples for each of these.
</p>


 Disintermediating Platforms 
<p>
    Many real-world experiences have been successfully digitized, but the resulting intermediation opens us to exploitation despite the conveniences. We need digitized experiences that respect human dignity and don't leave us open to being exploited for some company's advantage.  As an example consider how the identity metasystem could be the foundation for a system that <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/06/held_hostage.shtml">disintermediates the food delivery platforms</a>. Platform companies have been very successful in intermediating these exchanges and charging exorbitant rents for what ought to be a natural interaction among peers. 
</p>

<p>
    That's not to say platforms provide no value. The problem isn't that they charge for services, but that their intervening position gives them too much power to make markets and set prices. Platforms provide several things that make them valuable to participants: a means of discovering relevant service providers, a system to facilitate the transaction, and a trust framework to help participants make the leap over the trust gap, as <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/rachel_botsman_we_ve_stopped_trusting_institutions_and_started_trusting_strangers">Rachel Botsman puts it</a>. An identity metasystem supporting self-sovereign identity provides a <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2017/01/a_universal_trust_framework.shtml">universal trust framework</a> for <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/02/building_identity_systems_on_the__sovrin_network.shtml">building systems</a> that can serve as the foundation for creating markets without intermediaries. Such a system with support for a token can even facilitate the transaction without anyone having an intervening position. 
</p>
<p>
    Disintermediating platforms requires creating a peer-to-peer marketplace on top of the metasystem. While the metasystem provides the means of creating and managing the peer-to-peer relationship, defining this marketplace requires determining the messages to be exchanged between participants and creating the means of discovery. These messages might be simple or complex depending on the market and could be <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/06/did_messaging_a_batphone_for_everyone.shtml">exchanged using DIDComm</a>, or even ride on top of a <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/12/verifiable_credential_exchange.shtml">verifiable credential exchange</a>. There might be businesses that provide discovery, but they don't intermediate, they sit to the side of the interaction providing a service. For example, such a business might provide a service that allows a restaurant to define its menu, create a shopping cart, and provide for discovery, but the merchant could replace it with a similar service, providing competition, because the trust interaction and transaction are happening via a protocol built on a universal metasystem. 
</p>
<p>
    Building markets without intermediaries greatly reduces the cost of participating in the market and frees participants to innovate. Because these results are achieved through protocol, we do not need to create new regulations that stifle innovation and lock in incumbents by making it difficult for new entrants to comply. And these systems preserve human dignity and autonomy by removing administrative authorities.
</p>


 Digitizing Auto Accidents 

<p>
    As an example of the the kinds of interactions that people have every day that are difficult to bring into the administrative sphere, consider the interactions that occur between various participants and their representatives following an auto accident. Because these interactions are ad hoc, large parts of our lives have yet to enjoy the convenience of being digitized. In <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/08/youve_had_an_automobile_accident_multi-source_identity_to_the_rescue.shtml">You've Had an Automobile Accident</a>, I imagine a digital identity system that enables the kinds of ad hoc, messy, and unpredictable interactions that happen all the time in the physical world. 
</p>

<p>In this scenario, two drivers, Alice and Bob, have had an accident. Fortunately, no one was hurt, but the highway patrol has come to the scene to make an accident report. Both Alice and Bob have a number of credentials that will be necessary to create the report:</p>

 
     Proof of insurance issued by their respective insurance companies 
     Vehicle title from the state 
     Vehicle registration issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) in different states (potentially) 
     Driver's license, potentially from a different agencies than the one who registers cars and potentially in different states 
 

<p>In addition, the police officer has a credentials from the Highway Patrol, Alice and Bob will make and sign statements, and the police officer will create an accident report. What's more, the owners of the vehicles may not be the drivers. </p>

<p>
    Now imagine you're building a startup to solve the "car accident use case." You imagine a platform to relate to all these participants and intermediate the exchange of all this information. To have value, it has to do more than provide a way to exchange PDFs and most if not all of the participants have to be on it. The system has to make the information usable. How do you get all the various insurance companies, state agencies, to say nothing of the many body shops and hospitals, fire departments, and ambulance companies on board? And yet, these kinds of ad hoc interactions confront us daily.
</p>


 Taking our Rightful Place in the Digital Sphere 

<p>
    Devon Leffreto <a href="https://www.moxytongue.com/2020/07/relationship-structures-matter.html">said something recently</a> that made me think:
</p>
<blockquote>
    You do not have an accurate operational relationship with your Government.
</blockquote>
<p>
    My thought was "not just government". The key word is "operational". People don't have operational relationships anywhere online.4  We have plenty of online relationships, but they are not operational because we are prevented from acting by their anemic natures. Our helplessness is the result of the power imbalance that is inherent in bureaucratic relationships. The solution to the anemic relationships created by administrative identity systems is to provide people with the tools they need to operationalize their self-sovereign authority and act as peers with others online. Scenarios like the ones envisioned in the preceding section happen all the time in the physical world—in fact they're the norm. When we dine at a restaurant or shop at a store in the physical world, we do not do so under some administrative system. Rather, as embodied agents, we operationalize our relationships, whether they be long-lived or nascent, by acting for ourselves. An identity metasystem provides people with the tools they need to be "embodied" in the digital world and act autonomously.
</p>

<p>
    Time and again, various people have tried to create decentralized marketplaces or social networks only to fail to gain traction. These systems fail because they are not based on a firm foundation that allows people to act in relationships with sovereign authority in systems mediated through protocol rather than companies. We have a fine example of a protocol mediated system in the internet, but we've failed to take up the daunting task of building the same kind of system for identity. Consequently, when we act, we do so without firm footing or sufficient leverage. 
</p>

<p>
    Ironically, the internet broke down the walled gardens of CompuServe and Prodigy with a protocol-mediated metasystem, but surveillance capitalism has rebuilt them on the web. No one could live an effective life in an amusement park. Similarly, we cannot function as fully embodied agents in the digital sphere within the administrative systems of surveillance capitalists, despite their attractions. The emergence of self-sovereign identity, agreements on protocols, and the creation of a metasystem to operationalize them promises a digital world where decentralized interactions create life-like online experiences. The identity metasystem and the richer relationships that result from it promise an online future that gives people the opportunity to act for themselves as autonomous human beings and supports their dignity so that they can live an effective online life.
</p>

 

 End Notes 
 
     Two of my friends at the time, Eric Thompson and Stacey Son were playing with FPGAs that could crack hashed passwords, so we were aware of the problems and did our best to mitigate them.

Scott's seminal book on legibility and its unintended consequences, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00D8JJYWA/windleyofente-20">Seeing Like a State</a> for more on this idea.

     The one exception I can think of to this is email.  People act through email all the time in ways that aren't intermediated by their email provider. Again, it's a result of the architecture of email, set up over four decades ago and the culture that architecture supports.

The screenshot they have isn't the one I published, so I guess the
author got it running too... I hope they had fun!</p>
<p>Apparently it appeared in the June 2020 edition:</p>
<p></p>
<p>I guess because print media coverage is smaller, it feels cooler to
get covered these days in it in some way?</p>

  <p>Summary: Sovereign is the right word for describing the essential distinction between our inalienable self and the administrative identifiers and attributes others assign to us online.</p>


<a></a>


<p>
    Descartes didn't <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum">say</a> "I have a birth certificate, therefore I am." We do not spring into existence because some administrative system provisions an identifer for us. No single administrative regime, or even a collection of them, defines us. <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/">Doc Searls</a> said this to me recently:
</p>
<blockquote>We are, within ourselves, what <a href="https://poets.org/poem/invictus">William Ernest Henley calls</a> “the captain” of “my unconquerable soul”, and what <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7200015-i-know-i-am-deathless-i-know-this-orbit-of">Walt Whitman meant</a> when he said “I know this orbit of mine cannot be swept by a carpenter's compass,” and “I know that I am august. I do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself or be understood.” Each of us has an inner essence that is who we are.
</blockquote>

<p>
    Even in the digital realm, and limiting ourselves to what <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot7-toronto/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/five-mental-models-of-identity.md">Joe Andrieu calls</a> "functional identity", we are more than any single <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml">relationship</a>. Our identity is something we are, not something we have. And it's certainly not what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_provider">someone else provides</a> to us. We are self-sovereign. 
</p>

<p>
    Some shrink from the self-sovereign label. There are some good reasons for their reluctance. Self-sovereignty requires some explanation. And it has political overtones that make some uncomfortable. But I've decided to embrace it. Self-sovereign identity is more than decentralized identity. Self-sovereign identity implies autonomy and inalienability. 
</p>

<p>
    If our identity is inalienable, then it's <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/inalienable">not transferable to another and not capable of being taken away or denied</a>. To be inalienable is to be sovereign: to exercise supreme authority over one’s personal sphere—Whitman’s “orbit of mine.” Administrative identifiers, what others choose to call us, are alienable. Relationships are alienable. Most attributes are alienable1. Who we are, and our right to choose how we present ourselves to the world, is not alienable.  The distinction between the inalienable and the alienable, the self-sovereign and the administrative, is essential. Without this distinction, we are constantly at the mercy of the various administrative regimes we interact with. 
</p>

<p>
    Self-sovereignty is concerned with relationships and boundaries. When we say a nation is sovereign, we mean that it can act as a peer to other sovereign states, <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/10/self_sovereign_is_not_self_asserted.shtml">not that it can do whatever it wants</a>. Sovereignty defines the source of our authority to act. Sovereignty defines a boundary, within which the sovereign has complete control and outside of which the sovereign relates to others within established rules and norms. Self-sovereign identity defines the boundary in the digital space, gives tools to people and organizations so they can assert control—their autonomy, and defines the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml">rules for how relationships are formed, authenticated, and used</a>. 
</p>

<p>
    In the opening chapter of her groundbreaking book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N7UERGX/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</a>, Shoshana Zuboff asks the question "Can the digital future be our home?" Not if it's based on administrative identity systems and the anemic, ofttimes dangerous, relationships they create. By starting with self-sovereignty, we found our digital relationships on principles that support and preserve human freedom, privacy, and dignity. So, while talking about trust, decentralization, credentials, wallets, and DIDs might help explain how self-sovereign identity works, sovereignty explains why we do it. If self-sovereignty requires explanation, maybe that's a feature, not a bug. 
</p>

 
 End Notes 
 
     I'm distinguishing attributes from traits without going too deep into that idea for now.

<p>I’ve been systematically working through all the open issues filed about the OpenID Connect Logout specs in preparation for advancing them to Final Specification status.  I’m pleased to report that I’ve released drafts that address all these issues.  The new drafts are:</p>
 
 <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-rpinitiated-1_0-01.html">OpenID Connect RP-Initiated Logout 1.0 – draft 01</a> 
 <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-session-1_0-30.html">OpenID Connect Session Management 1.0 – draft 30</a> 
 <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-frontchannel-1_0-04.html">OpenID Connect Front-Channel Logout 1.0 – draft 04</a> 
 <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-backchannel-1_0-06.html">OpenID Connect Back-Channel Logout 1.0 – draft 06</a> 
 
<p>The OpenID Connect working group waited to make these Final Specifications until we received feedback resulting from certification of logout deployments.  Indeed, this feedback identified a few ambiguities and deficiencies in the specifications, which have been addressed in the latest edits.  You can see the certified logout implementations at <a href="https://openid.net/certification/">https://openid.net/certification/</a>.  We encourage you to likewise certify your implementations now.</p>
<p>Please see the latest History entries in the specifications for descriptions of the normative changes made.  The history entries list the issue numbers addressed.  The issues can be viewed in the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/openid/connect/issues?status=new&amp;status=open">OpenID Connect issue tracker</a>, including links to the commits containing the changes that resolved them.</p>

  <p>This week I've mostly been building <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql">datasette-graphql</a>, a plugin that adds GraphQL query support to Datasette.</p>

<p>I've been <a href="https://simonwillison.net/search/?q=graphql">mulling this over</a> for a couple of years now. I wasn't at all sure if it would be a good idea, but it's hard to overstate how liberating Datasette's plugin system has proven to be: plugins provide a mechanism for exploring big new ideas without any risk of taking the core project in a direction that I later regret.</p>

<p>Now that I've built it, I think I like it.</p>

 A GraphQL refresher 

<p><a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a> is a query language for APIs, first promoted by Facebook in 2015.</p>

<p>(Surprisingly it has nothing to do with the Facebook Graph API, which predates it by several years and is more similar to traditional REST. A third of respondents to my <a href="https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1289381085181140992">recent poll</a> were understandably confused by this.)</p>

<p>GraphQL is best illustrated by an example. The following query (a real example that works with <code>datasette-graphql</code>) does a whole bunch of work:</p>

  Retrieves the first 10 repos that match a search for "datasette", sorted by most stargazers first  Shows the total count of search results, along with how to retrieve the next page  For each repo, retrieves an explicit list of columns  <code>owner</code> is a foreign key to the <code>users</code> table - this query retrieves the <code>name</code> and <code>html_url</code> for the user that owns each repo  A repo has issues (via an incoming foreign key relationship). The query retrieves the first three issues, a total count of all issues and for each of those three gets the <code>title</code> and <code>created_at</code>.  

<p>That's a lot of stuff! Here's the query:</p>

 <code>{
  repos(first:10, search: "datasette", sort_desc: stargazers_count) {
    totalCount
    pageInfo {
      endCursor
      hasNextPage
    }
    nodes {
      full_name
      description
      stargazers_count
      created_at
      owner {
        name
        html_url
      }
      issues_list(first: 3) {
        totalCount
        nodes {
          title
          created_at
        }
      }
    }
  }
}</code> 

<p>You can <a href="https://datasette-graphql-demo.datasette.io/graphql?query=%7B%0A%20%20repos(first%3A%2010%2C%20search%3A%20%22datasette%22%2C%20sort_desc%3A%20stargazers_count)%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20totalCount%0A%20%20%20%20pageInfo%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20endCursor%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20hasNextPage%0A%20%20%20%20%7D%0A%20%20%20%20nodes%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20full_name%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20description%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20stargazers_count%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20created_at%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20owner%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20name%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20html_url%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%7D%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20issues_list(first%3A%203)%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20totalCount%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20nodes%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20title%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20created_at%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%7D%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%7D%0A%20%20%20%20%7D%0A%20%20%7D%0A%7D%0A">run this query against the live demo</a>. I'm seeing it return results in 511ms. Considering how much it's getting done that's pretty good!</p>

 datasette-graphql 

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql">datasette-graphql</a> plugin adds a <code>/graphql</code> page to any Datasette instance. It exposes a GraphQL field for every table and view. Those fields can be used to select, filter, search and paginate through rows in the corresponding table.</p>

<p>The plugin detects foreign key relationships - both incoming and outgoing - and turns those into further nested fields on the rows.</p>

<p>It does this by using table introspection (powered by <a href="https://sqlite-utils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/python-api.html#introspection">sqlite-utils</a>) to dynamically define a schema using the <a href="https://graphene-python.org/">Graphene</a> Python GraphQL library.</p>

<p>Most of the work happens in the <code>schema_for_datasette()</code> function in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/blob/main/datasette_graphql/utils.py">datasette_graphql/utils.py</a>. The code is a little fiddly because Graphene usually expects you to define your GraphQL schema using classes (similar to Django's ORM), but in this case the schema needs to be generated dynamically based on introspecting the tables and columns.</p>

<p>It has a solid set of unit tests, including some <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/tree/main/examples">test examples</a> written in Markdown which double as further documentation (see <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/blob/950ca0740a658780cdd3a91e4bbfdda4f48645ea/tests/test_graphql.py#L62-L74">test_graphql_examples()</a>).</p>

 GraphiQL for interactively exploring APIs 

<p><a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphiql">GraphiQL</a> is the best thing about GraphQL. It's a JavaScript interface for trying out GraphQL queries which pulls in a copy of the API schema and uses it to implement really comprehensive autocomplete.</p>

<p><code>datasette-graphql</code> includes GraphiQL (inspired by <a href="https://www.starlette.io/graphql/">Starlette's implementation</a>). Here's an animated gif showing quite how useful it is for exploring an API:</p>

<p></p>

<p>A couple of tips: On macOS option+space brings up the full completion list for the current context, and command+enter executes the current query (equivalent to clicking the play button).</p>

 Performance notes 

<p>The most convenient thing about GraphQL from a client-side development point of view is also the most nerve-wracking from the server-side: a single GraphQL query can end up executing a LOT of SQL.</p>

<p>The example above executes at least 32 separate SQL queries:</p>

  1 select against repos (plus 1 count query)  10 against issues (plus 10 counts)  10 against users (for the <code>owner</code> field)  

<p>There are some optimization tricks I'm not using yet (in particular the <a href="https://docs.graphene-python.org/en/latest/execution/dataloader/">DataLoader pattern</a>) but it's still cause for concern.</p>

<p>Interestingly, SQLite may be the best possible database backend for GraphQL due to the characteristics explained in the essay <a href="https://sqlite.org/np1queryprob.html">Many Small Queries Are Efficient In SQLite</a>.</p>

<p>Since SQLite is an in-process database, it doesn't have to deal with network overhead for each SQL query that it executes. A SQL query is essentially a C function call. So the flurry of queries that's characteristic for GraphQL really plays to SQLite's unique strengths.</p>

<p>Datasette has always featured arbitrary SQL execution as a core feature, which it protects using query time limits. I have an <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/issues/33">open issue</a> to further extend the concept of Datasette's time limits to the overall execution of a GraphQL query.</p>

 More demos 

<p>Enabling a GraphQL instance for a Datasette is as simple as <code>pip install datasette-graphql</code>, so I've deployed the new plugin in a few other places:</p>

 Future improvements 

<p>I have a bunch of <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/issues">open issues</a> for the plugin describing what I want to do with it next. The most notable <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/issues/16">planned improvement</a> is adding support for Datasette's canned queries.</p>

<p>Andy Ingram <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewingram/status/1289624490037530625">shared the following</a> interesting note on Twitter:</p>

<blockquote><p>The GraphQL creators are (I think) unanimous in their skepticism of tools that bring GraphQL directly to your database or ORM, because they just provide carte blanche access to your entire data model, without actually giving API design proper consideration.</p></blockquote>

<p>My plugin does exactly that. Datasette is a tool for publishing raw data, so exposing everything is very much in line with the philosophy of the project. But it's still smart to put some design thought into your APIs.</p>

<p><a href="https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/stable/sql_queries.html#canned-queries">Canned queries</a> are pre-baked SQL queries, optionally with parameters that can be populated by the user.</p>

<p>These could map directly to GraphQL fields. Users could even use plugin configuration to turn off the automatic table fields and just expose their canned queries.</p>

<p>In this way, canned queries can allow users to explicitly design the fields they expose via GraphQL. I expect this to become an extremely productive way of prototyping new GraphQL APIs, even if the final API is built on a backend other than Datasette.</p>

 Also this week 

<p>A couple of years ago I wrote a piece about <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2018/Apr/25/register-members-interests/">Exploring the UK Register of Members Interests with SQL and Datasette</a>. I finally got around to automating this using GitHub Actions, so <a href="https://register-of-members-interests.datasettes.com/">register-of-members-interests.datasettes.com</a> now updates with the latest data every 24 hours.</p>

<p>I renamed <code>datasette-publish-now</code> to <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-publish-vercel">datasette-publish-vercel</a>, reflecting Vercel's name change from Zeit Now. Here's <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-publish-vercel/issues/26">how I did that</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-insert">datasette-insert</a>, which provides a JSON API for inserting data, defaulted to working unauthenticated. MongoDB and Elasticsearch have taught us that insecure-by-default inevitably leads to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/07/more-than-1000-databases-have-been-nuked-by-mystery-meow-attack/">insecure deployments</a>. I fixed that: the plugin now requires authentication, and if you don't want to set that up and know what you are doing you can install the deliberately named <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-insert-unsafe">datasette-insert-unsafe</a> plugin to allow unauthenticated access.</p>

 <p>Is this the way you want your brand to look?</p> 
<p>Digital advertising needs to sniff its own stench, instead of everybody’s digital butts.</p>
<p>A sample of that stench is wafting through the interwebs from&nbsp; the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ana.net/content/show/id/ResponsibleAddressableMedia">Partnership for Responsible Addressable Media</a>, an ad industry bullphemism for yet another way to excuse the urge to keep tracking people against their wishes (and simple good manners) all over the digital world.</p>
<p>This new thing is a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granfalloon">granfalloon</a> conjured by the <a href="https://www.ana.net/about">Association of National Advertisers</a>&nbsp;(aka the <a href="https://www.ana.net/">ANA</a>) and announced today in the faux-news style of the press release (which it no doubt also is) at the first link above. It begins,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AD INDUSTRY LAUNCHES “PARTNERSHIP FOR RESPONSIBLE ADDRESSABLE MEDIA” TO ENSURE FUTURE OF DIGITAL MEDIA FOR BUSINESSES &amp; CONSUMERS<br>
Governing Group of Industry Leaders Includes 4A’s, ANA, IAB, IAB Tech Lab, NAI, WFA, P&amp;G, Unilever, Ford, GM, IBM, NBCUniversal, IPG, Publicis, Adobe, LiveRamp, MediaMath, The Trade Desk</p>
<p>NEW YORK (August 4, 2020) — Leading trade associations and companies representing every sector of the global advertising industry today joined together to launch the Partnership for Responsible Addressable Media, an initiative to advance and protect critical functionalities like customization and analytics for digital media and advertising, while safeguarding privacy and improving the consumer experience. The governing group of the Partnership will include the most influential organizations in advertising.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I learned about this from&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/wendyndavis">@WendyDavis</a>, who wrote&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/354347/ad-industry-launches-new-organization-will-push-g.html">this piece</a> in <a href="https://www.mediapost.com/">MediaPost</a>.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/">NiemanLab</a> summarizes what she reports with a <a href="https://twitter.com/NiemanLab/status/1290690368573526016">tweet</a> that reads, “A new ad-industry group will lobby Google and Apple to let them track users just a wee bit more, please and thank you.”</p>
<p>Writes Wendy,</p>
<blockquote><p>The group will soon reach out to browser developers and platforms, in hopes of convincing them to rethink recent decisions that will limit tracking, according to Venable attorney Stu Ingis, who will head the legal and policy working group.</p>
<p>“These companies are taking huge positions that impact the entire economy — the entire media ecosystem — with no real input from the media ecosystem,” Ingis says.</p></blockquote>
<p>As if the “entire media ecosystem” doesn’t contain the billions of humans being tracked.</p>
<p>Well, here’s a fact: ad blocking, which was already the <a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2015/09/28/beyond-ad-blocking-the-biggest-boycott-in-human-history/">biggest boycott in world history</a>&nbsp;five years ago, didn’t happen in a vacuum. Even though ad blockers had been available since 2004, use of them didn’t hockey-stick until 2012-13, exactly when adtech and its dependents in publishing gave the middle finger to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track">Do Not Track</a>, which was nothing more than a polite request, expressed by a browser, for some damn privacy while we go about our lives online. See <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/11/ad-blockers-and-the-next-chapter-of-the-internet">this</a> in Harvard Business Review:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here’s another fact: the browser makers actually care about their users, some of whom are paying customers (for example with Apple and Microsoft). They know what we want and need, and are giving it to us. Demand and supply at work.</p>
<p>The GDPR and the CCPA also didn’t happen in a vacuum. Both laws were made to protect citizens from exactly what adtech (tracking based advertising) does. And, naturally, the ad biz has been working mightily to obey the letter of those laws while violating their spirit. Why else would we be urged by cookie notices everywhere to “accept” exactly what we’ve made very clear that we don’t want?</p>
<p>So here are some helpful questions from the world’s billions to the brands now paying to have us followed like marked animals:</p>
<p>Have you noticed that not a single brand known to the world has been created by tracking people and aiming ads at them—even after spending a $trillion or two on doing that?</p>
<p>Have you noticed that nearly all the world’s major brands became known through advertising that not only didn’t track people, but <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/advertising-30">sponsored</a> <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2019/09/01/journalism-2/">journalism</a> as well?</p>
<p>Have you noticed that tracking people and directing personalized messages at them—through “addressable media”—is in fact direct marketing, which we used to call junk mail?</p>
<p>Didn’t think so.</p>
<p>Time to get the clues, ad biz. Brands too.</p>
<p>Start with&nbsp;<a href="http://cluetrain.com">The Cluetrain Manifesto</a>, which says, if you only have time for one clue this year, this is the one to get…</p>
<p>we are not seats or eyeballs or end users or consumers.<br>
we are human beings — and our reach exceeds your grasp.<br>
deal with it.</p>
<p>That year was 1999.</p>
<p>If advertising and marketing had bothered to listen back then, they might not be dealing today with the GDPR, the CCPA, and the <a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/the-adblock-war/">earned dislike</a> of billions.</p>
<p>Next, please learn (or re-learn) the difference between real advertising and the junk message business. Find that lesson in&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@dsearls/separating-advertisings-wheat-and-chaff-47858adfcb20#.i6msx57rv">Separating Advertising’s Wheat and Chaff</a>. An excerpt:</p>
<blockquote><p>See, adtech did not spring from the loins of Madison Avenue. Instead its direct ancestor is what’s called&nbsp;direct response marketing. Before that, it was called&nbsp;direct mail, or&nbsp;junk mail. In metrics, methods and manners, it is little different from its closest relative, spam.</p>
<p>Direct response marketing has always wanted to get personal, has always been data-driven, has never attracted the creative talent for which Madison Avenue has been rightly famous.&nbsp;<a>Look up&nbsp;best ads of all time</a>&nbsp;and you’ll find nothing but wheat. No direct response or adtech postings, mailings or ad placements on phones or websites.</p>
<p>Yes, brand advertising has always been data-driven too, but the data that mattered was how many people were exposed to an ad, not how many clicked on one — or whether you, personally, did anything.</p>
<p>And yes, a lot of brand advertising is annoying. But at least we know it pays for the TV programs we watch and the publications we read. Wheat-producing advertisers are called “sponsors” for a reason.</p>
<p>So how did direct response marketing get to be called advertising ? By looking the same. Online it’s hard to tell the difference between a wheat ad and a chaff one.</p>
<p>Remember the movie “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_the_Body_Snatchers">Invasion of the Body Snatchers</a>?” (Or the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_the_Body_Snatchers_%281978_film%29">remake by the same name</a>?) Same thing here. Madison Avenue fell asleep, direct response marketing ate its brain, and it woke up as an alien replica of itself.</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s what had happened to the ANA in 2018, when it <a href="https://www.martechadvisor.com/news/display-and-native-advertising/ana-association-of-national-advertisers-to-acquire-data-and-marketing-association/">acquired</a>&nbsp;what had been the Direct Marketing Association (aka DMA) and which by then called itself the&nbsp;Data &amp; Marketing Association.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ana.net/content/show/id/ResponsibleAddressableMedia">Partnership for Responsible Addressable Media</a>&nbsp;speaks in the voice of advertising’s alien replica. It does not “safeguard essential values in advertising as a positive economic force.” Instead it wants to keep using “addressable” advertising as the primary instrument of surveillance capitalism.</p>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/theagency/what-if-we-don-t-need-advertising-at-all-cf8ae123f2d3#.r2dr769a8">Maybe it’s too late</a>&nbsp;to save advertising from its alien self. But perhaps not, if what’s left of advertising’s soul takes the writings of&nbsp;<a href="https://adcontrarian.blogspot.com/">Bob Hoffman</a>&nbsp;(<a href="https://twitter.com/adcontrarian">@AdContrarian</a>) to heart. That’s the only way I know for advertising to clean up its act.</p>

<p>This post is just a record of the key insights I took away from Sam Harris’ enlightening <a href="https://samharris.org/podcasts/211-the-nature-of-human-nature/">talk with Robert Plomin</a>.</p>
<p>I sure wish it were easier to capture and embed these kinds of audio segments, and to do so more effectively — ideally with transcription. It was way too much work to construct the URLs that deliver these segments into the embedded players I’ve included here, even with the <a href="http://jonudell.net/av/audio.html?url=https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/wakingup/Making_Sense_211_Plomin2028Paywall29.mp3&amp;startmin=58&amp;startsec=52&amp;endmin=62&amp;endsec=0">tool I made</a> for that purpose. It’s nice to have a standard embedded player, finally, but since it doesn’t show the endpoints of the segments you can’t tell they’re each just a few minutes. It looks like they all run to the end.</p>
<p>I wound up going to more trouble than it’s probably worth to convey the most memorable parts of that excellent podcast, and I don’t have time to transcribe more fully, but for what it’s worth, here are the segments that I’ll be remembering.</p>
<p>1. “The most important thing we’ve learned from the DNA revolution in the last 10 years is that genetic influences on complex traits are due to thousands of tiny DNA differences.”<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>2. “These polygenic scores are perfectly normally distributed.”<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>3. “I’m saying there are no disorders, there are just quantitative dimensions.”</p>

    When you talk with cheese aficionados, it doesn’t usually take long for the conversation to veer this way: away from curds, whey, and mold, and toward matters of life and death.

  Zeynep Tufekci on aerosolized Covid-19 transmission and the need for ventilation.

<p>Zeynep Tufekci, in <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/07/why-arent-we-talking-more-about-airborne-transmission/614737/" title="We Need to Talk About Ventilation">a piece</a> for The Atlantic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jimenez also wondered why the National Guard hadn’t been deployed to set up
tent schools (not sealed, but letting air in like an outdoor wedding canopy)
around the country, and why the U.S. hadn’t set up the mass production of HEPA
filters for every classroom and essential indoor space. Instead, one
air-quality expert reported, teachers who wanted to buy portable HEPA filters
were being told that <a href="https://twitter.com/Poppendieck/status/1286300608836907009">they weren’t allowed</a> to, because the CDC wasn’t
recommending them. It is still difficult to get Clorox wipes in my
supermarket, but I went online to check, and there is no shortage of portable
HEPA filters. There is no run on them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s the profoundly irresponsible plan to reopen schools without any remotely
sufficient attempt to upgrade and modernize the air circulation systems of our
dilapidated public school buildings that disturbs me. Meanwhile, school
reopening proposals pay undue attention to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/07/scourge-hygiene-theater/614599/" title="Hygiene Theater Is a Huge Waste of Time">hygiene theater</a> to assuage fears,
while very real risks go largely unaddressed.<a>1</a> It simply won’t
work, and that means disastrous outcomes for communities.</p>
<p>And it’s not like there aren’t ways to get things under better control. Tufekci
continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, Japan masked up early, focused on <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32611985/" title="Cluster-based approach to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) response in Japan-February-April 2020">super-spreader events</a> (a strategy
it calls “<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-japan-beat-coronavirus-without-lockdowns-11594163172" title="How Japan Beat Coronavirus Without Lockdowns">cluster busting</a>”), and, crucially, trained its public to focus on
avoiding the three C’s—closed spaces, crowded places, and close conversations.
In other words, exactly the places where airborne transmission and aerosols
could pose a risk. The Japanese were advised not to talk on the subway, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-japan-has-long-accepted-covids-airborne-spread-and-scientists-say-ventilation-is-key/" title="Japan has long accepted COVID's airborne spread, and scientists say ventilation is key">where
windows were kept open</a>. Oshitani said they also developed guidelines that
included the importance of ventilation in many different settings, such as
bars, restaurants, and gyms. Six months later, despite having some of the
earliest outbreaks, ultradense cities, and one of the oldest populations in
the world, Japan has had about 1,000 COVID-19 deaths total—which is how many
the United States often has in a single day. Hong Kong, a similarly dense and
subway-dependent city, has had only 24 deaths.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The U.S. needs to get it shit together. We have the wealth and knowledge to do
this right, but need to put empathy for each other ahead of temporary political
and economic impacts to do so.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>In fairness, the <a href="https://www.schools.nyc.gov/school-year-20-21/return-to-school-2020/health-and-safety">Health and Safety</a> section the New York
City DOE’s <a href="https://www.schools.nyc.gov/school-year-20-21/return-to-school-2020">Return to School 2020-2021</a> plan says that the “DOE will make
improvements to HVAC systems, as well as air conditioning repairs, to improve
air circulation, as well as replacing regular air filters with higher
efficiency types.” Still, there’s a social failing here, national leaders
ought to fund the upgrading of air circulation systems to the highest
standards in every school and classroom in the United States. <a>↩︎</a></p>

   How a Cheese Goes Extinct 
 Ruby Tandoh writes for the New Yorker about the culture, history and anthropology of cheesemaking through the lens of the British cheese industry. I learned that two of my favourite British cheeses - Tymsboro and Innes Log, have sadly ceased production. Beautifully written.

  <p>Summary:      We build digital identity systems to create and manage relationships—not identities. We need our digital relationships to have integrity and to be useful over a specified lifetime. Identity systems should provide relationship integrity and utility to participants for the appropriate length of time. Participants should be able to create relationships with whatever party will provide utility. SSI provides improved support for creating, managing, and using digital relationships.</p>


<a></a>

<p>
    The most problematic word in the term <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/06/what_is_ssi.shtml">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)</a> isn't "sovereign" but "identity" because whenever you start discussing identity, the conversation is rife with unspoken assumptions. Identity usually conjures thoughts of authentication and various federation schemes that purport to make authentication easier. I frequently point out that even though SSI has "identity" in it's name, there's no artifact in SSI called an "identity." Instead the user experience in an SSI system is based on forming relationships and using credentials.
</p>

<p>
    I've been thinking a lot lately about the role of relationships in digital identity systems and have come to the conclusion that we've been working on building building systems that support digital relationships without acknowledging the importance of relationships or using them in our designs and architectures.  The reason we build identity systems isn't to manage identities, it's to support digital relationships. 
</p>
<p>
    I recently read and then reread a 2011 paper called <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2163241">Identities Evolve: Why Federated Identity is Easier Said than Done</a> from <a href="https://www.constellationr.com/users/steve-wilson">Steve Wilson</a>. Despite being almost ten years old, the paper is still relevant, full of good analysis and interesting ideas. Among those is the idea that the the goal of using federation schemes to create a few identities that serve all purposes is deeply flawed. Steve's point is that we have so many identities because we have have lots of relationships. The identity data for a given relationship is contextual and highly evolved to fit its specific niche. 
</p>

<p>
    Steve's discussion reminded me of a <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/samramji/darwins-finches-20th-century-business-and-apis/119">talk Sam Ramji used to give about speciation of APIs</a>. Sam illustrated his talk with a picture from <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/evolution-scientific-theory/Adaptive-radiation">Encyclopedia Britannica</a> to show adaptive radiation in Galapagos finches in response to evolutionary pressure. These 14 different finches all share a common ancestor, but ended up with quite different features because of specialization for a particular niche.
</p>

	<a></a>

<p>
    In the same way, each of us have hundreds, even thousands, of online relationships. They each have a common root but are highly contextualized. Some are long-lived, some are ephemeral. Some are personal, some are commercial. Some are important, some are trivial. Still, we have them. The information about ourselves, what many refer to as identity data, that we share with each is just as adapted to the specific niche that the relationship represents as the Galapagos finches are to their niches. Once you realize this, the idea of creating a few online identities to serve all needs becomes preposterous. 
</p>

<p>
    Not only is each relationship evolved for a particular niche, but it is also constantly changing. Often those changes are just more of what's already there. For example, my Netflix account represents a relationship between me and Netflix. It's constantly being updated with my viewing data but not changing dramatically in structure. But some changes are larger. For example, it also allows me to create additional profiles which makes the relationship specialized for the specific members of my household. And when Netflix moved from DVDs only to streaming, the nature of my relationship with Netflix changed significantly.
</p>

<p>
    I'm convinced that identity systems would be better architected if we were more intentional about their need to support specialized relationships spanning millions of potential relationship types. This article is aimed at better understanding the nature of digital relationships.
</p>

 Relationships 

<p>
    One of the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2017/10/fixing_the_five_problems_of_internet_identity.shtml">fundamental problems of internet identity</a> is proximity. Because we're not interacting with people physically, our natural means of knowing who we're dealing with are useless. <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot7-toronto/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/five-mental-models-of-identity.md">Joe Andrieu defines identity</a> as "how we recognize, remember, and respond" to another entity. These three activities correspond to three properties digital relationships must have to overcome the proximity problem: 
</p>
 
     Integrity—we want to know that, from interaction to interaction, we're dealing with the same entity we were before. In other words, we want to identify them. 
     Lifespan—normally we want relationships to be long-lived, although we also create ephemeral relationships for short-lived interactions.  
     Utility—we create online relationships in order to use them within a specific context. 
 

<p>
    We'll discuss each of these in detail below, followed by a discussion of risk in digital relationships.
</p>

 Relationship Integrity 

<p>
    Without integrity, we cannot recognize the other party to the relationship. Consequently, all identity systems manage relationship integrity as a foundational capability. Federated identity systems improve on one-off, often custom identity systems by providing integrity in a way that reduces user management overhead for the organization, increases convenience for the user, and increases security by eliminating the need to create one-off, proprietary solutions. SSI aims to establish integrity with the convenience of the federated model but without relying on an intervening IdP in order to provide autonomy and privacy. 
</p>

<p>
    A relationship has two parties, let's call them P1 and P2.1 P1 is connecting with P2 and, as a result, P1 and P2 will have a relationship. P1 and P2 could be people, organizations, or things represented by a website, app, or service. Recognizing the other party in an online relationship relies on being able to know that you're dealing with the same entity each time you encounter them. 
</p>

<p>
    In a typical administrative identity system, when P1 initiates a relationship with P2, P2 typically uses usernames and passwords to ensure the integrity of the relationship. By asking for a username to identify P1 and a password to ensure that it's the same P1 as before, P2 has some assurance that they are interacting with P1. In this model, P1 and P2 are not peers. Rather P2 controls the system and determines how and for what it is used. 
</p>

<p>
    In a federated flow, P1 is usually called the subject or consumer and P2 is called the relying party (RP). When the consumer visits the RP's site or opens their app, they are offered the opportunity to establish a relationship through an identity provider (IdP) whom the RP trusts. The consumer may or may not have a relationship with an IdP the RP trusts. RPs pick well-known IdPs with large numbers of users to reduce friction in signing up. The consumer chooses which IdP they want to use from the relying party's menu and is redirected to the IdP's identity service where they present a username and password to the IdP, are authenticated, and redirected back to the RP. As part of this flow, the RP gets some kind of token from the IdP that signifies that the IdP will vouch for this person. They may also get attributes that the IdP has stored for the consumer.2  
</p>

<p>
    In the federated model, the IdP is identifying the person and attesting the integrity of the relationship to the RP. The IdP is a third party, P3, who acts as an intervening administrative authority. Without their service, the RP may not have an alternative means of assuring themselves that the relationship has integrity over time. On the other hand, the person gets no assurance from the identity system about relationship integrity in this model. For that they must rely on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">TLS</a>, which is visible in a web interaction, but largely hidden inside an app on a mobile device.  P1 and P2 are not peers in the federated model. Instead, P1 is subject to the administrative control of both the IdP and the RP. Further, the RP us subject to the administrative control of the IdP. 
</p>

<p>
    In SSI, a relationship is initiated when P1 and P2 exchange <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/02/decentralized_identifiers.shtml">decentralized identifiers</a> (DID). For example, when a person visits a web site or app, they are presented with a connection invitation. When they accept the invitation, they use a software agent to share a DID that they created. In turn, they receive a DID from the web site, app, or service.  We call this a "connection" since DIDs are cryptographically based and thus provide a means of both parties mutually authenticating. The user experience does not necessarily surface all this activity to the user. To get a feel for the user experience, run through the <a href="https://try.connect.me">demo at Connect.me</a>3.
</p>

<p>
    In contrast to the federated model, the participants in SSI mutually authenticate and the relationship has integrity without the intervention of a third party. By exchanging DIDs both parties have also exchanged public keys. They can consequently use cryptographic means to ensure they are interacting with the party who controls the DID they received when the relationship was initiated. Mutual authentication, based on self-initiated DIDs provides SSI relationships with inherent integrity. <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2016/10/on_sovereignty.shtml">P1 and P2 are peers in SSI</a> since they both have equal control over the relationship. 
</p>

<p>
    In addition to removing the need for intermediaries to vouch for the integrity of the relationship, the peer nature of relationships in SSI also means that neither party has access to the authentication credentials of the other. Mutual authentication means that each party manages their own keys and never shares the private key with another party. Consequently, attacks, like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21326200/elon-musk-bill-gates-twitter-hack-bitcoin-scam-compromised">recent attack on Twitter accounts</a> can't happen in SSI because there's no administrator who has access to the credentials of everyone using the system. 
</p>

 Relationship Lifespan 

<p>
    Whether in the physical world or digital, relationships have lifespans. Some relationships are long-lived, some are short-term, and others are ephemeral, existing only for the duration of a single interaction. We typically don't think of it this way, but every interaction we have in the physical world, no matter for what purpose or how short, sets up a relationship. So too in the digital world, although our tools, especially as people online, have been sorely lacking. 
</p>

<p>
    I believe one of the biggest failings of modern digital identity systems is our failure to recognize that people often want, even need, short-lived relationships. Think about your day for a minute. How many people and organizations did you interact with in the physical world4 where you established a permanent relationship? What if whenever you stopped in the convenience store for a cup of coffee, you had to create a permanent relationship with the coffee machine, the cashier, the point of sale terminal, and the customers in line ahead and behind you? Sounds ridiculous. But that's what most digital interactions require. At every turn we're asked to establish permanent accounts to transact and interact online. 
</p>

<p>
    There are several reasons for this. The biggest one is that every Web site, app, or service wants to send you ads, at best, or track you on other sites, at worst. Unneeded, long-lived relationships are the foundation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism">surveillance economy</a> that has come to define the modern online experience. 
</p>

<p>
    There are a number of services I want a long-lived relationship with. I value my relationships with Amazon and Netflix, for example. But there are many things I just need to remember for the length of the interaction. I ordered some bolts for a car top carrier from a specialty place a few weeks ago. I don't order bolts all the time, so I just want to place my order and be done. I want an ephemeral relationship. The Internet of Things will increase the need for ephemeral relationships. When I open a door with my digital credential, I don't want the hassle of creating a long-term relationship with it; I just want to open the door and then forget about it. 
</p>

<p>
    Digital relationships should be easy to set up and tear down. They should allow for the relationship to grow over time, if both parties desire. While they exist, they should be easily managable while providing all the tools for the needed utility. Unless there's long term benefit to me, I shouldn't need to create a long term relationship. And when a digital relationship ends, it should really be over. 
</p>



 Relationship Utility 

<p>
    Obviously, we don't create digital relationships just so we can authenticate the other party. Integrity is a necessary, but insufficient, condition for an identity system.  This is where most identity models fall short. We can understand why this is so given the evolution of the modern Web. For the most part, user-centric identity really took off when the web gave people reasons to visit places they didn't have a physical relationship with, like an ecommerce web site. Once the identity system had established the integrity of the relationship, at least from the web site's perspective, we expected HTTP would provide the rest.
</p>

<p>
    Most Identity and Access Management systems don't provide much beyond integrity except possibly access control. Once Facebook has established who you are, it knows just what resources to let you see or change.  But as more and more of our lives are intermediated by digital services, we need more utility from the identity system than simple access control. The most that an IdP can provide in the federated model is integrity and, perhaps, a handful of  almost-always-self-asserted attributes in a static, uncustomizable schema. But rich relationships require much more than that.
</p>

<p>
    Relationships are established to provide utility. An ecommerce site wants to sell you things. A social media site wants to show you ads. Thus, their identity systems, built around the IAM system, are designed to do far more than just establish the integrity of the relationship. They want to store data about you and your activities. For the most part this is welcome. I love that Amazon shows me my past orders, Netflix remembers where I was in a series, and Twitter keeps track of my followers and past tweets. 
</p>

<p>
    The true identity system is much, much larger and specialized than the IAM portion. All of the account or profile data these companies use is properly thought of as part of the identity system that they build and run. Returning to <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot7-toronto/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/five-mental-models-of-identity.md">Joe Andrieu</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>Identity systems acquire, correlate, apply, reason over, and govern [the] information assets of subjects, identifiers, attributes, raw data, and context.
</blockquote>
<p>
    Regardless of whether or not they outsource the integrity of their relationships (and notice that none of the companies I list above do), companies still have to keep track of the relationships they have with customers or users in order to provide the service they promise. They can't outsource this to a third party because the data in their identity system has evolved to suit the needs of the specific relationship. We'll never have a single identity that serves all relationships because they are unique contexts that demand their own identity data. Rip out the identity system from a Netflix or Amazon and it won't be the same company anymore.
</p>

<p>
    This leads us to a simple, but important conclusion: You can't outsource a relationship. Online apps and services decorate the relationship with information they observe, and use that information to provide utility to the relationships they administer. Doing this, and doing it well is the foundation of the modern web. 
</p>

<p>
    Consequently, the bad news is that SSI is not going to reduce the need for companies to <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/02/building_identity_systems_on_the__sovrin_network.shtml">build, manage, and use identity systems</a>. Their identity systems are what make them what they are—there is no "one size fits all" model. The good news is that SSI makes online relationships richer. Relationships are easier and less expensive to manage, not just for companies, but for people too. Here's some of the ways SSI will enhance the utility of digital relationships:
</p>

 
     Richer, more trustworthy data—Relationships change over time because the parties change. We want to reliably ascertain facts about the other party in a relationship, not just from direct observation, but also from third parties in a trustworthy manner to build confidence in the actions of the other party within a specific context. <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/12/verifiable_credential_exchange.shtml">Verifiable credentials</a>, self-issued or from others, allow relationships to be enhanced incrementally as the relationships matures or changes. 
     
     Autonomy and choice through peer relationships—Peer relationship give each party more autonomy than traditional administrative identity systems have provided. And, through standardization and substitutability, SSI gives participants choice in what vendors and agents they employ to manage their relationships. The current state of digital identity is asymmetric, providing companies with tools that are difficult or unwieldy for people to use. People like <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/">Doc Searls</a> and organizations like <a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/vrm/2019/05/13/me2b-2/">Project VRM</a> and the <a href="https://www.me2b.us">Me2B Alliance</a> argue that people need tools for managing online relationships too. SSI provides people with tools and <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/07/its_the_autonomy_stupid.shtml">autonomy</a> to manage their online relationships with companies and each other. 
     
     Better, more secure communications—DID exchange provides a <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/06/did_messaging_a_batphone_for_everyone.shtml">private, secure messaging channel</a> using the <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html">DIDComm protocol</a>. This messaging channel is mutually recognized, authenticated, and encrypted. 
     Unifying, interoperable protocol for data transmission—DIDs and Verifiable Credentials, and DIDComm provides a standardized, secure means of interaction. Just like URLs, HTML, and HTTP provided for an interoperable web that led to an explosion of uses, the common protocol of SSI will ensure everyone benefits from the network effects. 
     
     Consistent user experience—Similarly, SSI provides a consistent user experience, regardless of what digital wallet people use. SSI's user experience is centered on relationships and credentials, not arcane addresses and keys. The user experience mirrors the experience people have of managing credentials in the physical world. 
     
     Support for ad hoc digital interactions—The real world is messy and unpredictable. <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/08/youve_had_an_automobile_accident_multi-source_identity_to_the_rescue.shtml">SSI is flexible enough to support the various ad hoc scenarios</a> that the world presents us and supports sharing multiple credentials from various authorities in the ways the scenario demands.
     
 

<p>
    These benefits are delivered using an architecture that provides a common, interoperable layer, called the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/08/life-like_identity_why_the_internet_needs_an_identity_metasystem.shtml">identity metasystem</a>, upon with <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/02/building_identity_systems_on_the__sovrin_network.shtml">anyone can build the identity systems they need</a>. A ubiquitous identity layer for the internet must be a metasystem that provides the building blocks and protocols necessary for others to build identity systems that meet the needs of any specific context or domain. An identity metasystem is a prerequisite for an online world where identity is as natural as it is in the physical world. An identity metasystem can remove friction, decrease cognitive overload, and make online interactions more private and secure.
</p>

 Relationships, Risk, and Trust 

<p>
    Trust is a popular term in the SSI community. People like Steve Wilson and <a href="https://identitywoman.net/about-kaliya/bio/">Kaliya Young</a> rightly ask about risk whenever someone in the identity community talks about trust. Because of the proximity problem, digital relationships are potentially risky. One of the goals of an identity system is to provide evidence that can be used in the risk calculation. 
</p>

<p>
    In their excellent paper, <a href="https://philarchive.org/rec/NICTAR-2">Risk and Trust</a>, Nickel and Vaesen define trust as the "disposition to willingly rely on another person or entity to perform actions that benefit or protect oneself or one’s interests in a given domain." From this definition, we see why crypto-proponents often say "To trust is good, but to not trust is better." The point being that not having to rely on some other human, or human-mediated process is more likely to result in a beneficial outcome because it reduces the risk of non-performance. 
</p>

<p>
    Relationships imply a shared domain, context, and set of activities. We often rely on third parties to tell us things relevant to the relationship. Our vulnerability, and therefore our risk, depends on the degree of reliance we have on another party's performance.  Relationships can never be "no trust" because of the very reasons we create relationships. Bitcoin, and similar systems, can be low or no trust precisely because the point of the system is to reduce the reliance on any relationship at all. The good news, is the architecture of the SSI stack significantly limits the ways we must rely on external parties for the exchange of information via verifiable credentials and thus reduces the vulnerability of parties inside and outside of the relationship. The SSI identity metasystem clearly delineates the parts of the system that are low trust and those where human processes are still necessary. 
</p>

<p>
    The exchange of verifiable credentials can be split into two distinct parts as shown in the following diagram. SSI reduces risk in remote relationships using the properties of these two layers to combine cryptographic processes with human processes. 
</p>

	<a></a>
	SSI Stack (click to enlarge)



<p>
    The bottom layer, labeled Identity Metasystem, comprises two components: a set of verifiable data repositories for storing metadata about credentials and a processing layer supported by protocols and practices for the transport and validation of credentials. Timothy Ruff <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/verifiable-credentials-arent-credentials-they-re-containers-fab5b3ae5c0">uses the analogy of shipping containers</a> to describe the identity metasystem. Verifiable credentials are analogous to shipping containers and the metasystem is analogous to the shipping infrastructure that makes intermodal shipping so efficient and secure. The Identity Metasystem provides a standardized infrastructure that similarly increases the efficiency and security of data interchange via credentials. 
</p>

<p>
    The top layer, labeled Identity Systems, is where people and organizations determine what credentials to issue, determine what credentials to seek and hold, and determine which credentials to accept. This layer comprises the individual credential exchange ecosystems that spring up and the governance processes for managing those credential ecosystems. In Timothy's analogy to shipping containers, this layer is about the data—the cargo—that the credential is carrying.
</p>

<p>
    The Identity Metasystem allows verifiable credentials can be cryptographically checked to ensure four key properties that relate to the risk profile. 
</p>
 
     Who issued the credential? 
     Was the credential issued to the party presenting it? 
     Has the credential been tampered with? 
     Has the credential been revoked? 
 
<p>
    These checks show the fidelity of the credential and are done without the verifier needing a relationship with the issuer. And because they're automatically performed by the Identity Metasystem, they significantly reduce the risk related to using data transferred using verifiable credentials. This is the portion of credential exchange that could be properly labeled "low or no trust" since the metasystem is built on standards that ensure the cryptographic verifiability of fidelity without reliance on humans and human-mediated processes. 
</p>

<p>
    The upper, Identity Systems, layer is different. Here we are very much relying on the credential issuer. Some of the questions we might ask include:
</p>
 
     Is the credential issuer, as shown by the identifier in the credential, the organization we think they are? 
     Is the organization properly accredited in whatever domain they're operating in?  
     What data did the issuer include in the credential? 
     What is the source of that data? 
     How has that data been processed and protected?  
 

<p>
    These questions are not automatically verifiable in the way we can verify the fidelity of a credential. They are different for each domain and perhaps different for each type of relationship based on the vulnerability of the parties to the data in the credential and their appetite for risk. Their answers depend on the provenance of the data in the credential. We would expect to see credential verifier's perform provenance checks by answering these and other questions during the process they use to establish trust in the issuer. Once the verifier has established this trust, the effort needed to evaluate the provenance of the data in a credential should cease or be greatly reduced.  
</p>

<p>
    As parties in a relationship share data with each other, the credential verifier will spend effort evaluating the provenance of issuers of credentials they have not previously evaluated. Once that is done, the metasystem will provide fidelity checks on each transaction. For the most part, SSI does not impose new ways of making these risk evaluations. Rather, most domains already have processes for establishing the provenance of data. For example, we know how to determine if a bank is a bank, the accreditation status of a university, and the legitimacy of a business. Companies with heavy reliance on properties of their supply chain, like pharmaceuticals, already have processes for establishing the provenance of the supply chain. For the most part, verifiable credential exchange will faithfully present digital representations of the kinds of physical world processes, credentials, and data we already know how to evaluate.  Consequently, SSI promises to significantly reduce the cost of reducing risk in remote relationships without requiring wholesale changes to existing business practices. 
</p>

 Conclusion 

<p>
    Relationships have always been the reason we created digital identity systems. Our historic focus on relationship integrity and IAM made modern Web 2.0 platforms and services possible, but has limited use cases, reduced interoperability, and left people open to privacy and security breaches. By focusing on peer relationships supported by an Identity Metasystem, SSI not only improves relationships integrity but also better supports flexible relationship lifecycles, more functional, trustworthy relationship utility, and provides tools for participants to correctly gauge, respond to, and reduce risks inherent in remote relationships. 
</p>


 

 Notes 
 
     For simplicity, I'm going to limit this discussion to two-party relationships, not groups. 
     I've described federation initialization very generally here and left out a number of details that distinguish various federation architectures.  
     Connect.me is just one of a handful of digital wallets that support the same SSI user experience. Others vendors include <a href="https://trinsic.id/">Trinsic</a>, <a href="https://idramp.com/">ID Ramp</a>, and <a href="https://self-ssi.com/en/">eSatus AG</a>. 
      Actually, imagine a day before Covid-19 lockdown.

  Public Radio: What is the best NPR station in the country? That’s a question on Quora I thought needed answering. So I did, with this: Here’s a quantitative answer to your qualitative question:&nbsp;WVPS&nbsp;of&nbsp;Vermont Public Radio.

 <p>Radio is moving from these to servers of streams and podcasts.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.quora.com/Public-Radio-What-is-the-best-NPR-station-in-the-country">Public Radio: What is the best NPR station in the country</a>? That’s a question on Quora I thought needed answering. So I did, with this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Here’s a quantitative answer to your qualitative question:&nbsp;<a title="en.wikipedia.org" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WVPS">WVPS</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a title="www.vpr.org" href="https://www.vpr.org/#stream%2F0">Vermont Public Radio</a>. Because, in&nbsp;<a title="ratings.radio-online.com" href="https://ratings.radio-online.com/cgi-bin/rol.exe/arb_menu_rank">Nielsen’s Audio Ratings</a>, it scores a 12.6 in&nbsp;<a title="ratings.radio-online.com" href="https://ratings.radio-online.com/cgi-bin/rol.exe/arb505">its home market of Burlington</a>, and a 16.2 in its neighbor market of<a title="ratings.radio-online.com" href="https://ratings.radio-online.com/cgi-bin/rol.exe/arb432">&nbsp;Montpelier-Waterbury</a>. Far as I know, those are tops among all the country’s NPR-affiliated stations.</p>
<p>Honorable mentions go to WUOM&nbsp;<a title="ratings.radio-online.com" href="https://ratings.radio-online.com/cgi-bin/rol.exe/arb581">in Ann Arbor</a>&nbsp;with a 13.0, KCLU&nbsp;<a title="ratings.radio-online.com" href="https://ratings.radio-online.com/cgi-bin/rol.exe/arb591">in Santa Barbara</a>&nbsp;with a 10.2—plus others you’ll find if you follow the links in&nbsp;<a title="blogs.harvard.edu" href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2019/04/04/public/">Where Public Radio Rocks</a>, which I published in April of last year. All the numbers I sourced have changed since then, but they’re easy to find at the links I provided.</p>
<p>In the long run, however, “best” will come to mean&nbsp;which stations, producers and distributors are best at streaming and podcasting. Because that’s where listening is headed. Vermont Public Radio makes that clear on their own website, which appends “#stream/0” to its URL when you go there—and does its best, on the site, to encourage listening over-the-net rather than just over-the-air.</p>
<p>At this point in history, nearly all radio stations already stream, for a good reason: in the digital world, where every one of us with a smartphone and a data plan has the best radio ever made, antique broadcast virtues such as “range” and “coverage” have become bugs. This is why, when my family drove around Spain in a rental car last summer, we listened to KCLU from our home town of Santa Barbara, piped from one of our phones through the car’s entertainment system (which is no longer called a “radio”). It’s also why, when I’m up early on the West Coast, I often listen to WBUR from Boston or WNYC from New York, my other home towns. (I get around—or at least I did before the plague.)</p>
<p>The streaming numbers in Nielsen’s ratings are still low, but they are growing, and in many markets exceed the numbers for nearly all the remaining AM stations. For example, in&nbsp;<a title="ratings.radio-online.com" href="https://ratings.radio-online.com/content/arb015">the latest ratings for Washington, DC,</a>&nbsp;36 stations are listed: 33 FM, 2 streams and 2 AM. Those are drawn from a roster of 52 FM and 35 AM stations with listenable signals in Washington (according to&nbsp;<a title="radio-locator.com" href="http://radio-locator.com/">radio-locator.com</a>)—and 6 of those FM signals are translators for AM stations, including the two AMs that show in the ratings (which means that even the ratings for AM stations were likely for those stations’ FM signals).</p>
<p>Also, while&nbsp;streaming&nbsp;is the big trend for&nbsp;stations,&nbsp;podcasting&nbsp;is the big trend for&nbsp;programming, aka “content.” Podcasting is exploding now, and earning ever-larger slices of the listening pie, which is a finite sum of people’s time. Podcasting wins at this because it has far more optionality than live over-the-air radio. You can listen when you like, slide forward and backward through a show, jump past ads or skip over topics you’d rather miss, and listen at 1.5x or 2x the normal speed. Those are huge advantages.</p>
<p>It’s also not for nothing that SiriusXM just paid $325 for Stitcher (<a title="variety.com" href="https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/siriusxm-buys-stitcher-325-million-1234704617/#!">says Variety)</a>, and not long before that Spotify&nbsp;<a title="www.msn.com" href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/tv/news/joe-rogan-signs-exclusive-100-million-podcast-deal-with-spotify/ar-BB14jDHC">paid $100 million</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<a title="en.wikipedia.org" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Rogan">Joe Rogan</a>’s podcast and (<a title="www.businessinsider.com" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/spotify-ringer-deal-price-250-million-podcasting-bill-simmons-report-2020-2">according to Business Inside</a>r) nearly $200 million for&nbsp;<a title="www.theringer.com" href="https://www.theringer.com/">The Ringer</a>&nbsp;and “nearly $400 million in recent purchases of Gimlet Media, Anchor, and Parcast.”</p>
<p>For that kind of money you could buy every AM and FM station in New York or Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Noncommercial players are also looking pretty good in the podcasting world as well.&nbsp;<a title="analytics.podtrac.com" href="http://analytics.podtrac.com/industry-rankings/">According to Podtrac</a>, NPR is the #1 podcast publisher and PRX is #5. Also showing well are WNYC Studios, This American Life/Serial and American Public Media. NPR also has 9 of&nbsp;<a title="analytics.podtrac.com" href="http://analytics.podtrac.com/industry-rankings/">the top 20 podcasts</a>. In fact the majority (11) of those top 20 are from public radio sources.</p>
<p>Off the top of my head, the public stations with head starts in podcast production are WBEZ in Chicago, WBUR in Boston, WNYC in New York, KQED in San Francisco, KPCC and KCRW in Los Angeles and others you’ll hear credited when they open or close a show.</p>
<p>But it’s early. Expect lots of change in the coming months and years as many podcast creators, producers and distributors jockey for positions in two races. One is the free public one, syndicated by&nbsp;<a title="en.wikipedia.org" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</a>&nbsp;on the open Internet and ready to hear on any browser, app or device. The other is the private subscription one, available only through the owner’s services. This is clearly where SiriusXM and Spotify are both going. SiriusXM is audible only by subscription, while Spotify remains $free (for now) but exclusive. (For example, Michelle Obama’s&nbsp;<a title="open.spotify.com" href="https://open.spotify.com/show/71mvGXupfKcmO6jlmOJQTP">new podcast</a>&nbsp;is available only on Spotify.) This split, between free/open and paid/closed, will be a big story over the coming years.</p>
<p>So, in the meantime, hats off to Vermont Public Radio for being the top public radio operation in the country—at least in its markets’ ratings. And stay tuned for the fights among players in streaming and podcasting.</p></blockquote>
<p>I expect VPR will continue being the alpha broadcasting, streaming and podcasting service in its home state, both because it does a great job and because Vermont is very much a collection of communities that have come to depend on it.</p>
<p>And, if you want to know why I think journalism of the fully non-fake kind has a last (or first) refuge in the most local forms, dig <a href="https://tedxsantabarbara.com/2018/doc-searls/">The story isn’t the whole story</a>, my TEDx talk about that.</p>

<p>This should have been a tweet. But the format was not&nbsp;fitting.</p><p>The promise of a personal decentralized identity is that the trust component involved in your use of credentials in the real world can be replicated online. In the real world, when you present your driving license to a law enforcement officer during a periodical check, the officer checks its validity and legitimacy by looking at specific features on your driving license. Since they are a trained eye, the error rate in verifying your document is lower than what a layman would have and the accuracy even better when the officer is aided by tools such as UV light to check for holograms and other security features. Once they are satisfied with your document, you can proceed with your business or transaction at&nbsp;hand.</p><p>It may seem straightforward that the scenario described is replicable digitally. If the interaction between you and an academic officer or a law enforcement officer was digital, you would send a scanned copy of your driving license or school leaving certificate over email or through an online portal. Once submitted, they verify security features on the documents and either involve a senior officer or send them to a verifying body to ascertain authenticity. This takes time and before you get a confirmation that your document was approved, and that you can proceed with your intended activity, days are gone not to mention the opportunity cost involved.</p><p>While that has been largely the case in our regular interactions involving using our identifying documents and issued credentials, the bottlenecks can be minimized to make processes smoother. We should note that the document, the primary actor in the entire interaction/exchange is not truly digital. It is a scan, an image or a photograph of your certificate or license. You and I (the humans) can read and make out the information contained there. Computers cannot. We are in 2020. Computers should. If your documents were machine readable, computer systems that handle them would be able to process the information, and heck, even verify the information by themselves. Some documents today are machine readable and make information systems very efficient. But there should be a way to make this the new&nbsp;normal.</p><p>Enter Verifiable Credentials (VCs). An open standard that forward thinking technologists and organizations, after facing the frustrations described and seeing the potential value being locked up in non-machine-verifiable documents, came up with under the World Wide Web Consortium (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C</a>). Verifiable Credentials support machine-to-machine communication and their proofs (security features) can be verified cryptographically using the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). Issuing and Verifying authorities have their work made easier as they can independently check a common registry for proofs regarding the individual and the credential presented. There is no need for a third party to countercheck where the Mathematical proofs are well implemented and the registry, once written on is tamper proof. Such a database could be a blockchain or a sufficiently consensus driven distributed ledger.</p>Figure 1: Exchange of Verifiable Credentials between Issuer, Holder, and Verifier.<p>Why should you care? Well, in this COVID-19 era, we are all trying to avoid unnecessary human contact. Because of Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt, even documents are being quarantined if physical copies are exchanged and more services now insist on digital forms of documents. That’s where Verifiable Credentials come in. It should be possible, once available, that a certificate proving you have been vaccinated against corona virus or that you graduated from university remotely, is shared as a Verifiable Credential. One noteworthy forward thinking initiative that is working on making this a reality is the <a href="https://www.covidcreds.com/">COVID-19 Credentials Initiative</a> (CCI). Vibranium ID is a part of it. The work of the initiative is not restricted to the pandemic as a reactive response but is a basis as to how we can unlock the promise of Verifiable Credentials.</p><p>Fun fact: After the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L7V2mXWUO5fjiwJODyq_wMvkL9EDSf3m7emLxLpvzTk/edit#">Governance Framework (GF) of the CCI</a> approved the CCI GF, three Kenyan software developers (Mbora Maina, Amos Kibet, Chris Achinga) and I translated the document into <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ejnylgHi-A_nZeZrnwBjaWzhjPIDq8ETMMJiiwKZbm0/edit?usp=sharing">Kiswahili</a>. The translation gives context as to the practicability of VCs in the real&nbsp;world.</p><p>Innovation waits for no man. The pandemic has proved so. The adjustment brought by this disease has surely made some processes redundant and will bring gamechanging technologies to the foreground. As Peter Drucker famously said, “Innovate or&nbsp;die”.</p><p>References</p><p>Figure 1: A Verifiable Credentials Primer, by Manu Sporny, Digital&nbsp;Bazaar</p><p>W3C Verifiable Credentials - <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/vibranium-id/digital-credentials-for-a-safer-world-37a2e1694791">Digital Credentials for a Safer World</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/vibranium-id">Vibranium ID</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 A DIF-hosted resource for community development  Introduction <p>It has been almost three years since DIF began working on the <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/a-universal-resolver-for-self-sovereign-identifiers-48e6b4a5cc3c">Universal Resolver</a> (GitHub: <a href="http://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver">Universal Resolver) </a>— a foundational piece of infrastructure for the Decentralized Identity ecosystem (see the <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/a-universal-resolver-for-self-sovereign-identifiers-48e6b4a5cc3c">original announcement</a>). Since then, our vision of being interoperable across ledgers and DID methods has seen a lot of support. Thanks to community contributions, the Universal Resolver now supports around 30 different DID&nbsp;methods.</p><p>Today, we are happy to announce an updated set of instances where the Universal Resolver is deployed. One stable and one experimental version will be iterated, maintained, and hosted by DIF as a service to the community!🎉</p><p>While this is undoubtedly a useful resource for research, experimentation, testing, and development, it is important that it not be mistaken for a production-grade universal resolver. It should be pointed out&nbsp;that:</p>  This infrastructure is neither intended or approved for production use cases and that nobody should rely on it for anything other than for development and testing purposes.  These two specific deployments are not production-ready. The preferred scenario continues to be that all DID-based information systems, run by a method operator or otherwise, production or otherwise, host their own instance of the Universal Resolver (or other DID Resolution tools).  DIF withholds the right to limit or modify the performance of this free service in case usage for production, commercial, and/or malicious purposes is detected.   Two Deployments <p>The following two deployments are now available as a community service:</p><p>* <a href="https://resolver.identity.foundation/">https://resolver.identity.foundation/</a> — Hosted on IBM Cloud by DIF (thanks IBM!). While not considered production-ready, this instance is expected to be relatively stable. It will be tested before and after manual updates from time to time, with versioned releases.<br>* <a href="https://dev.uniresolver.io/">https://dev.uniresolver.io/</a> — Hosted on AWS by DIF. This instance is more experimental, will be updated frequently, and is connected to CI/CD processes. It may be down from time to time or have unexpected functionality changes.</p><p>Note: For backward compatibility, the original URL <a href="https://uniresolver.io/">https://uniresolver.io/</a> will now redirect to <a href="https://dev.uniresolver.io/">https://dev.uniresolver.io/</a>.</p> Documentation <p>See the following links for more information about testing, release, and deployment processes of the Universal Resolver:</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@polarmermaid">Anne&nbsp;Nygård</a>  AWS Architecture: <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/dev-system.md">https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/dev-system.md</a>  CI/CD Process: <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/continuous-integration-and-delivery.md">https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/continuous-integration-and-delivery.md</a>  Branching Strategy: <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/branching-strategy.md">https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/branching-strategy.md</a>  Release process: <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/creating-releases.md">https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/creating-releases.md</a>  Periodically, this standing work item is discussed in the <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/identifiers-discovery.html">Identifiers and Discovery Working Group</a>, so that group’s recorded meetings and discussions on Slack and <a href="https://dif.groups.io/g/id-wg">mailing list</a> may contain further insight on the above&nbsp;topics.   <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/the-universal-resolver-infrastructure-395281d2b540">The Universal Resolver Infrastructure</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>来る日本時間7月28日午前3:30から、「So You Want to Base on Consent?」というタイトルでIdentiverseで講演します。</p>



<p>このタイトルは、グレン・グールドの「So You Want to Write a Fugue?」という曲から着想を得たもので、ある意味無謀なことを、といいながら、じゃぁどうしたらよいのかということをISO/IEC 29184 から抽出してお話します。</p>



<p>この「So You Want to Write a Fugue?」という曲の出だしの歌詞、こうなんです。</p>



<blockquote><p>So you want to write a fugue?<br>You’ve got the Urge to write a fugue, <br>You’ve got the nerve to write a fugue, <br>So go ahead. </p>Glenn Gould: So you want to write a fugue (1963)</blockquote>



<blockquote><p>ほほう、フーガが書きたいとな？<br>フーガを書きたいという衝動があり、<br>フーガを書くという根性があると<br>いうならやってみなさい。</p>上記：私訳</blockquote>



<p>出だしでそう歌って、フーガの様々な技法をこの曲の中で紹介していきます。</p>



 

 Glenn Gould: So you want to write a fugue? (1963)



<p>「フーガを書きたいを」、「同意で取り扱いたい」で置き換えたのがこの講演です。いわば、</p>



<blockquote><p>ほほう、同意でやりたいとな？<br>同意でやりたいという衝動があり、<br>同意でやりきるという根性があると<br>いうならやってみなさい。</p></blockquote>



<p>内容は…7月21日にPWSでやったのとほぼ同じことの英語版です。もしご興味があればどうぞ。</p>



<p>Monday, July 27, 12:30 – 12:55 (Mountain Time)</p>



<p>So You Want to Base on Consent?</p>



<p>Many people seem to believe that having their customers pressing “Agree” button is good enough to collect their “consent”. That’s actually not the case. Obtaining privacy consent has very high bar partly because that is the exception mechanism that you can resort to only when other lawful bases for the processing of personal data does not work.</p>



<p>This session will briefly touch on other lawful bases and what is needed for potentially valid consent, then goes on to explain the requirements for privacy notice and consent process set out in “ISO/IEC 29184 Online privacy notices and consent”.</p>



<p>ISO/IEC 29184 is an international standard that has been in making for the last 5 years. Stakeholders involved in the discussion included data protection authorities around the globe, technical community, lawyers, and businesses. It sets out the requirements for 1) What are needed to be in a privacy notice, 2) What are needed to be done in obtaining the consent, 3) What are needed to be done in the maintenance of privacy notices. For any business that wants to respect customer privacy, this document provides excellent guidance on what needs to be followed.<br>Speaker/s: Nat Sakimura<br>Topic: Privacy</p>

<p>Across almost 73 laps around the Sun, I’ve seen six notable comets. The fifth was Hale-Bopp, which I blogged about <a href="http://searls.com/comets.html">here</a>, along with details on the previous four, in 1997. The sixth is NEOWISE, and that’s it, above, shot with my iPhone 11. There are a couple other shots in that same album, taken with my Canon 5D Mark III. Those are sharper, but this one shows off better.</p>
<p>Hey, if the comet looks this good over the lights of Los Angeles, you might have a chance to see it wherever you are tonight. It’ll be under the Big Dipper in the western sky.</p>
<p>Every night it will be a bit dimmer and farther away, so catch it soon. Best view is starting about an hour after sunset.</p>

My first attempt at the <a href="https://ondemand.thestand.co.uk/Video/EGMEGL/the_cabaret_of_dangerous_ideas">Cabaret of Dangerous Ideas</a>. Scary…</p>
<p>I was nervous and I know I could have conveyed my thoughts with more clarity and coherence. I virtually missed out my section on trust - our way of navigating the uncertainties of our environment. Still, I am grateful for the opportunity and everyone who helped make it happen. I largely enjoyed myself. And I learnt a lot. I look forward to hopefully attempting a full show next year!</p>
<p>My show, <a href="https://wip-abramson.dev/in-control">#AreYouInControl?</a>, was an attempt to condense and convey a period of reflection into the role and impact identity technology in the complex system that is human society. A web of relationships and influence that limit and expand the possibilities of individuals as they navigate uncertainty and seek to optimise some values perceived to be important in a given context at a given moment in time and space. </p>
<p>My background is not in social science, I research digital identity, privacy and to lesser extent cryptography. The digital world represents this fascinatingly tangled mesh of human social and economic interaction. It has infinitely expanded the set of possible possibilities. The fact that we could run a virtual show is a testament to the expansion of capabilities to interact. It has also created new risks - privacy, security, surveillance, manipulation. And new constraints on interaction, the set of characters and emojis we can use to communicate with, the mechanisms we use to identify and authenticate others, the set of possible actions a platform supports.</p>
<p>These new environments that we exist within are no longer inanimate, they are designed, developed and populated by human beings. The environment has become a source of data, a digital representation of collective memory. Whether intentionally or not, the constraints, risks and possibilities emergent in these virtual spaces are perceived subjectively by each of us. There can be little doubt that these systems present powerful mechanisms for influence at the individual, group and societal level.</p>
<p>The challenge that we must all grapple with, is power to who? For what purpose? Who decides?</p>
<p>Digital technology is neither good nor bad. It is up to us to decide the values these virtual spaces incentivise, what rules they enforce, who they benefit and how they can be changed.</p>
<p>So are you in control?</p>
<p>No, but is control something we should aspire for?. Uncertainty and independent thought is <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/S/bo3620295.html">the difference that makes a difference</a> in our complex human system. We should embrace it and protect it.</p>
<p>Instead of control, we should strive for influence and agency driven through intention and the freedom from the intrusive influence of others intentionally kept beyond our awareness. I am interested in technology that can foster cooperation, participation and democratic governance among individuals so they can become empowered agents for change in our society.</p>
<p>I am not sure how much of the above I managed to convey. What can I say, I certainly was not in control despite the influence I attempted to exert through practice and preparation.</p>

 <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/infrastructure/albums/72157694493013900"></a><p>These are among the since-demolished towers of the once-mighty WMEX/1510 radio in Boston.</p> 
<p>The question on Quora was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.quora.com/How-long-does-a-radio-station-last-on-average">How long does a radio station last on average?</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.quora.com/How-long-does-a-radio-station-last-on-average/answer/Doc-Searls">Here is my answer</a>, which also addresses the bigger question of what will happen to radio itself.</p>
 
<p>Radio station licenses will last as long as they have value to the owners—or that regulators allow them to persist. Call signs (aka call letters) come and go, as do fashions around them.* But licenses are the broadcasting equivalent of real estate. Their value is holding up, but it won’t forever.</p>
<p>Arguing for persistence is the simple fact that many thousands of radio station licenses have been issued since the 1920s, and the vast majority of those are still in use.</p>
<p>Arguing for their mortality, however, are signs of rot, especially on the AM band, where many stations are shrinking—literally, with smaller signals and coverage areas—and some are dying. Four reasons for that:</p>
 
 FM and digital media sound much better. Electrical (and especially computer) noise also infects all but the strongest signals. It also doesn’t help that the AM radios in most new cars sound like the speakers are talking through a pillow. 
 Syndicated national programming is crowding out the local kind. This is due to consolidation of ownership in the hands of a few large companies (e.g. Entercom, Cumulus, iHeart) and to the shift of advertising money away from local radio. The independent local AM (and even FM) station is in the same economic pickle as the independent local newspaper. 
 AM transmission tends to come from towers, or collections of them, on many acres of land. Now, as suburbs spread and the value of real estate goes up,&nbsp;the land under many AM transmitters exceeds the value of the stations themselves. A typical example is&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KDWN">KDWN/720</a>&nbsp;in Las Vegas. Since it was born in 1975, KDWN has been 50,000 watts day and night (the legal max), with a night signal that blanketed the whole West Coast. But, in the last year, the station moved a site where it can share another station’s towers, downscaling the signal to just 25,000 watts by day and 7,500 watts by night. <a title="goo.gl" href="https://goo.gl/maps/uNA2JDMtuPt5tQUbA">Here is a 2019 Google StreetView</a>&nbsp;of the old site, with a For Sale sign. Also note also that KDWN now identifies as “<a title="kdwn.com" href="https://kdwn.com/">101.5 FM / 720 AM – The Talk of Las Vegas</a> .” The 101.5 is its 250-watt translator (signal repeater), known legally as <a href="http://K268CS">K268CS</a>. From its perch atop&nbsp;<a title="en.wikipedia.org" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Strat_(Las_Vegas)">The Strat</a>&nbsp;(formerly the Stratosphpere) on The Strip, the translator puts out a good-enough FM signal to <a href="https://radio-locator.com/cgi-bin/pat?call=K268CS&amp;service=FX">cover</a> the heart of the Las Vegas metro. Today many AM stations exist only as an excuse to operate FM translators like this one. Even fully successful AM stations play this new game.&nbsp;<a title="en.wikipedia.org" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WBBM_(AM">WBBM/780</a>, the legacy all-news station that (rarely among AMs) is still ranked #1 in the&nbsp;<a title="ratings.radio-online.com" href="https://ratings.radio-online.com/content/arb005">Nielsen Ratings for Chicago</a>, sold the land under its old towers and now shares the towers of another station, where it radiates with less power. 
 In the Battle of the Bands, FM won. For evidence, look at the&nbsp;<a title="ratings.radio-online.com" href="https://ratings.radio-online.com/content/arb015">Nielsen Audio Ratings for the Washington DC region</a>. Only two AMs show, and they’re at the bottom. One is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WBQH">WBQH/1050</a>, a regional Mexican formatted station with an 0.2% share of listening and a signal that is only 44 watts at night. And most of the listening likely owes to the station’s 180-watt translator on 93.5fm. (Both only cover a few northside suburbs and the northern tip of DC.) The other station is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WSBN">WSBN/630am</a>, a sports station with an 0.1% share: a number that couldn’t be lower without disappearing. That license was once&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WSBN#Early_years">WMAL</a>, which <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2015/02/10/will-wmal-survive-losing-its-transmitter/">sold off the land under its towers</a> a few years ago, moving far out of town to “diplex” on the towers of yet another station that long ago sold the land under&nbsp;its original towers. That other station is now called&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWRC">WWRC/570</a>. It’s a religious/conservative talker with no ratings that was once <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WGMS_(Washington)#Early_history">WGMS</a>, famous in its glory years as a landmark classical station. 
 
<p>Despite this, the number of AM licenses in the U.S persist in the thousands, while the number of abandoned AM licenses number in the dozens. (The FCC’s&nbsp;<a title="www.fcc.gov" href="https://www.fcc.gov/media/radio/silent-am-list">Silent AM Broadcast Stations List</a>&nbsp;is 83 stations long. The&nbsp;<a title="www.fcc.gov" href="https://www.fcc.gov/media/radio/silent-fm-list">Silent FM Broadcast Stations List</a>&nbsp;is longer, but includes a lot of translators and LPFMs—low-power stations meant to serve a few zip codes at most. Also, neither list includes licenses that have been revoked or abandoned in the distant past, such as the once-legendary&nbsp;<a title="en.wikipedia.org" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISN_(Vancouver,_Washington)">KISN</a>&nbsp;in Portland, Oregon.)</p>
<p>What I’ve reported so far applies only to the U.S. AM band, which is called MW (for mediumwave) in most of the rest of the world. In a lot of that world, AM/MW is being regulated away: abandoned by decree. That’s why it is gone, or close to it, in some European countries. Canada has also scaled back on AM, with the&nbsp;<a title="en.wikipedia.org" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Broadcasting_Corporation">CBC</a> &nbsp;moving in many places exclusively to FM.</p>
<p>The news is less bad for FM, which has thrived since the 1970s, and now accounts for most over-the-air radio listening. The FCC has also done its best to expand the number of stations and signals on the FM band, especially in recent years through translators and LPFMs. In&nbsp;<a title="radio-locator.com" href="https://radio-locator.com/cgi-bin/locate?select=city&amp;city=las%2Bvegas%2C%2Bnv&amp;x=0&amp;y=0">Radio-Locator’s list of stations you’ll recieve in Las Vegas</a>, 16 of the 59 listed signals are for translators and LPFMs. Meanwhile only 18 stations have listenable signals on AM, and some of those signals (such as KDWN’s) are smaller than they used to be.</p>
<p>Still, the effects of streaming and podcasting through the Internet will only increase. This is why so many stations, personalities, programming sources and station owners are rushing to put out as many streams and podcasts as possible. Today, every phone, pad and laptop is a receiver for every station with digital content of any kind, and there are many more entities competing for this “band” than radio stations alone.</p>
<p>While it’s possible that decades will pass before AM and FM are retired completely, it’s not hard to read the tea leaves. AM and FM are both gone now in Norway, which has switched to&nbsp;<a title="en.wikipedia.org" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Audio_Broadcasting">Digital Audio Broadcasting</a>, or DAB, as has much of the rest of Europe. (We don’t have DAB in the U.S., and thus far there is very little interest in it.)</p>
<p>Still, I don’t doubt that many of entities we call “stations” will persist without signals. Last summer we listened to local radio from Santa Barbara (mostly&nbsp;<a title="en.wikipedia.org" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KCLU-FM">KCLU</a>) while driving around Spain, just by jacking a phone into the dashboard and listening to Internet streams through the cellular data system. Even after all their transmitters get turned off, sometime in the far future, I’m sure KCLU will still be KCLU.</p>
<p>The process at work here is what the great media scholars&nbsp;<a title="en.wikipedia.org" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan">Marshall McLuhan</a>&nbsp;and his son&nbsp;<a title="en.wikipedia.org" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_McLuhan">Eric</a> &nbsp;(in&nbsp;<a title="www.amazon.com" href="https://www.amazon.com/Laws-Media-Science-Marshall-McLuhan/dp/0802077153">Laws of Media: The New Science</a>) call&nbsp;retrieval. What they mean is that every new medium retrieves the content of what it obsolesces. So, much as print retrieved writing and TV retrieved radio, the Internet retrieves damn near everything it obsolesces, including TV, radio, print, speech and you-name-it.</p>
<p>In most cases the old medium doesn’t go away. But broadcasting might be different, because it exists by grace of regulation, meaning governments&nbsp;can&nbsp;make them disappear. The FCC has already done that to much of the UHF TV band, auctioning off the best channels to cellular systems. This is why, for example, T-Mobile can brag about their new long-range “5G” coverage. They’re <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobodonnell/2019/12/02/t-mobile-nationwide-5g-launch-highlights-range-vs-speed/#691c0b89648d">getting that coverage</a> that over what used to be UHF TV channels that stations auctioned away. It’s also why, for example, when you watch&nbsp;<a title="en.wikipedia.org" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KLCS">KLCS</a>, channel 58 in Los Angeles, you’re actually watching channel 28, which the station shares with KCET, using the same site and transmitter. The Los Angeles Unified School District collected a cool $130,510,880 in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_auction">spectrum auction</a> for channel 58.</p>
<p>So, when listening to the AM and FM bands drops sufficiently, don’t assume the FCC won’t say, “Hey, all the stations that matter are streaming and podcasting on the Internet, so we’re going to follow the path of Norway.” When that happens, your AM and FM radios will be as useful as the heavy old TVs you hauled out to the curb a decade ago.</p>

<p>*In the ‘1970s, the hot thing in music radio was using high-value scrabble letters: Z, Q and J. Also combining those with “dial” positions, e.g. “Z-100.”</p>

CREDIT: © DAVID NOTON PHOTOGRAPHY / ALAMY/DAVID NOTON PHOTOGRAPHY /&nbsp;ALAMY This is part 3 of a 3-part&nbsp;series: <p>Part 1: <a href="https://medium.com/p/fab5b3ae5c0/edit">Verifiable Credentials Aren’t Credentials. They’re Containers.</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/like-shipping-containers-verifiable-credentials-will-economically-transform-the-world-fece2b9da14a">Like Shipping Containers, Verifiable Credentials Will Economically Transform the&nbsp;World</a></p><p>Part 3: How Verifiable Credentials Bridge Trust&nbsp;Domains</p> TL;DR:   Most organizations aren’t digitally connected to one another, creating “trust domain” barriers that are slow, manual, and expensive to traverse.  Similar to shipping containers, Verifiable Credentials (VCs) can bridge trust domains between and within organizations, by using you as their&nbsp;courier.  The potential ramifications of transitive trust with rapid verifiability are endless, when boundaries between trust domains from many of today’s friction-filled interactions all but disappear.   The Barriers VCs Can Bridge: Trust&nbsp;Domains <a href="https://www.coloradoinfo.com/royal-gorge-region">https://www.coloradoinfo.com/royal-gorge-region</a><p>Today, if you’re applying for a loan at your financial institution (FI) and need to prove your employment, how can you do so digitally, instantly? You can’t, in most cases. Why? Because it’s not feasible for every FI to have a direct, digital connection to every possible employer they may need data from. The same boundaries exist between schools, when a student transfers and desires to receive credit for classes taken: it’s untenable for every school to have a direct connection to every other&nbsp;school.</p><p>This leaves FI’s, employers, schools and other organizations in separate, unconnected trust domains, unable to directly exchange trusted data and reliant on manual processes, often through third-party data brokers acting as intermediaries. Exchanging data between trust domains today is analogous to the manual, labor-intensive “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Break_bulk_cargo">break-bulk</a>” process used for millennia for all global trade prior to shipping containers, and is similarly slow, complicated, and expensive.</p><p>This is also why VC adoption may be resisted by incumbent data intermediaries as vigorously as <a href="https://www.discovercontainers.com/a-complete-history-of-the-shipping-container/">labor unions protested shipping containers</a>.</p><p>And this is the same reason we have so many usernames and passwords in the first place: there is no universal way to traverse trust domains in the digital realm. Identity federations within a single trust domain, like what’s offered by the current IAM industry to large organizations, solve this problem elegantly. But cross-domain identity federations, however, have repeatedly attempted to address this and <a href="http://lockstep.com.au/library/identity_authentication/the-false-allure-of-federated.html">failed for various reasons</a>, leaving the problem unresolved and ballooning.</p><p>The boundaries between digital trust domains are understandably high, as the stakes can be high, the risk of fraud ever-present, and fraudsters can comfortably apply their trade from anywhere. We know these boundaries well:</p>  Having many usernames and passwords  Cumbersome forms and onboarding processes  Verbally authenticating when calling a service center, and re-authenticating when being transferred  Waiting for agreements to be signed or consent to be&nbsp;given  Waiting for any kind of application to be&nbsp;approved  Slow verifications of any kind of documents, records  Many slow and/or tedious processes that rely on verifications  <p>Any time you are slowed down or prevented from doing something because you can’t quickly prove something, it’s a manifestation of boundaries between trust domains, much like the bygone situation in shipping that necessitated “break-bulk.” If gatekeepers, human or automated, could quickly verify everything they needed to verify, they could quickly open their&nbsp;gates.</p><p>With VCs, they now&nbsp;can.</p> How VCs Bridge Trust&nbsp;Domains <p>This post already assumes a basic understanding of how VCs work, but at the risk of being redundant, I want readers to understand, mechanically, how VCs bridge trust&nbsp;domains.</p><a href="https://despair.com/products/dysfunction">https://despair.com/products/dysfunction</a><p>I think this ^^ is one of the funnier “demotivators” at despair.com, a site everyone should check out for a good laugh. As with most humor, what makes a demotivator funny is the thread of truth that runs through&nbsp;it.</p><p>The relevant truth in this poster is this: the only consistent feature in ALL of your relationships — not just your dissatisfying ones — is you. You are the common factor between all your employers, your FIs, your schools, and every other organization you deal with, and that makes you the ideal courier of data between&nbsp;them.</p><p>If only you had the data… and if only it could be trusted when you delivered it…</p><p>Well, this is where our super duper data shipping container comes in, the VC. Here’s how it all comes together:</p>  You start with an empty digital SSI wallet. Not the Apple kind or Android kind or anything else similarly proprietary and non-portable, but a standardized self-sovereign digital wallet that’s all yours, where you literally hold the digital keys to&nbsp;it.  You offer/accept connections to/from other people, organizations, or things using QR codes or other means of bootstrapping. These are peer-to-peer relationships that you now own and control, and not through some platform or company where they could be seen, controlled, or taken away from&nbsp;you.  When VCs are offered to you by your connections, you choose whether to accept them into your wallet. When you do, you’re now a “holder.” An entity who gives you a VC, whether person, organization, or thing, is called an “issuer.”  When you want to prove something to someone, or share verifiable data, you must first connect with them (#2) then you can share one or more of your VCs. You can also share a subset of data from a VC and not the whole thing, or just proof that you have a VC, or a compound proof from multiple&nbsp;VCs.  In seconds, verifiers can verify four things about what you’ve&nbsp;shared:    Who (or what) issued it to&nbsp;you  It was issued to you and not someone&nbsp;else  It hasn’t been tampered&nbsp;with  It hasn’t been revoked by the&nbsp;issuer  <p>Voila! Data has just left one trust domain and been accepted into another, without any direct connections between the&nbsp;two.</p><p>Most important: verifiers can confirm these four things cryptographically, without having to contact the original issuer. If verifiers had to contact the original issuer to confirm things, that defeats the whole purpose and we’d be back to square one. But they don’t, so we’re not, and that changes everything.</p><p>By using you as the courier of verifiable data between organizations you deal with, unrelated trust domains now have a bridge, and without requiring direct connections to one another. The key to making this all work is that issuers, holders, and verifiers all use the same interoperable protocols. This is why cooperation among competitors and the VC standards work¹ is critical, and exciting that it has made so much progress over the last several&nbsp;years.</p> The Vast Potential of Verifiable Credentials CREDIT: Evernym,&nbsp;Inc.<p>The potential ramifications of transitive trust with rapid verifiability are endless, when boundaries between trust domains for many of today’s friction-filled interactions all but disappear:</p>  No more usernames or passwords, replaced by trusted&nbsp;VCs  No more forms, quick and easy onboarding everywhere  No more verbal authentication, you’re recognized everywhere you choose to&nbsp;be  Instant, digital, multi-party consent (after waiting for slow humans to decide something)  Instant application approvals  Instant verifications of documents, records  The efficient exchange of any trusted information  <p>The effects for user experience would be wonderful. Friction from trying new vendors, products, and services would reduce to almost nothing. Customers can be instantly recognized as valued guests rather than treated as strangers at each new interaction. Processes and workflows can be simplified, automated, and accelerated, and new, nearly seamless experiences offered.</p> In Conclusion <p>The current inability for data to efficiently traverse trust domains bears a striking resemblance to global trade complexities prior to 1956; Verifiable Credentials bear a striking resemblance to its revolutionary solution, the shipping container.</p><p>Due to the enormous physical, logistical and even political obstacles to adoption, it took shipping containers more than a decade to hit their stride, for everyone to realize their potential. With VCs it will happen much more quickly, as much of our world is already digital, and connected.</p><p>I have often said during my five years in SSI that the tech titans of tomorrow are being created today, and I believe that now more than ever. If there’s a sweet spot for when to jump on the SSI bandwagon, we may still be a tad early, but not much, and I don’t think it will last as long as comparable opportunity sweet spots may have in the&nbsp;past.</p><p>VCs are the shipping containers of our lifetime, with all that&nbsp;entails.</p><p>This is part 3 of a 3-part&nbsp;series:</p><p>Part 1: <a href="https://medium.com/p/fab5b3ae5c0/edit">Verifiable Credentials Aren’t Credentials.

<a href="https://www.atclogistic.net/service/">https://www.atclogistic.net/service/</a> This is part 2 of a 3-part&nbsp;series: <p>Part 1: <a href="https://medium.com/p/fab5b3ae5c0/edit">Verifiable Credentials Aren’t Credentials. They’re Containers.</a></p><p>Part 2: Like Shipping Containers, Verifiable Credentials Will Economically Transform the&nbsp;World</p><p>Part 3: <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/how-verifiable-credentials-bridge-trust-domains-97155d0f3c17">How Verifiable Credentials Bridge Trust&nbsp;Domains</a></p> TL;DR:   Verifiable Credentials (VCs) aren’t just functionally similar to shipping containers, they are economically similar as well, and will bring an explosion in global digital trade like shipping containers brought for global physical trade. The right container at the right time can change the world, dramatically.  Shipping containers caused a precipitous drop in shipping costs (over 95%) by bridging the physical contexts between ships, trains, and trucks; VCs can deliver a similar cost reduction in the digital realm, by bridging the contexts between organizations.  The transitive trust enabled by VCs enables cooperative network effects, which are even bigger than regular network&nbsp;effects.   If VCs Are Economically Similar to Shipping Containers, It’s a Big&nbsp;Deal <p>The comparison of VCs to shipping containers is much more than a passing one. This analogy, which I’ve been using in presentations and conversations for the last couple of months, has been a big improvement when teaching the basic concept of VCs from a functional standpoint. It is simple, clear, and everyone seems to quickly understand it, a rare breath of messaging fresh air in a world of confusing SSI&nbsp;lingo.</p><p>But more important than messaging clarity, if VCs are economically similar to shipping containers, the ramifications to the digital economy are hard to overstate; everyone in SSI will be in for one heckuva&nbsp;ride.</p><p>In fact, I believe this possibility — that Verifiable Credentials are economically similar to shipping containers — could be the most impactful business realization of my lifetime.</p> The Right Container = Economic Explosion <p>From a humble beginning in 1956, “containerization” brought an explosion in global trade and became “more of a driver of globalisation than all trade agreements in the past 50 years taken together,” according to <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2013/05/18/the-humble-hero">The Economist</a>.</p><p>But how?</p><p>Before 1956, when shipping containers were invented by trucking entrepreneur Malcolm McLean, the world already had containers of many kinds — barrels, bags, boxes and crates — that needed to be painstakingly emptied when a ship arrived at port, and contents moved into other containers on trucks and trains. This manual “break-bulk” process, unchanged for millennia, was slow, complicated, dangerous, and&nbsp;costly.</p><p>Instead, Mr. McLean envisioned a container that was sturdy, stackable, secure, and most important: moved intact from a truck onto a train or a ship, and then back again when a ship reached its destination, without being re-packed along the way. It took a few years to really take off, but when shipping containers proved their immense usefulness in the Vietnam war it became clear they were the future, and the ISO then introduced the first shipping container standards that the industries of ships, trains, and trucks would begin to adhere&nbsp;to.</p><p>The rest, as they say, is&nbsp;history.</p><p>The efficiency gains were so dramatic that producers of raw materials and small manufacturers in every corner of the world could now market their products to every other corner of the world, changing global trade forever. “Made in China” wouldn’t be a thing today without “containerization.”</p> From $5.86 to&nbsp;$.16 <p>There were many other containers in existence prior to 1956; why did this particular container make such a disproportionate difference?</p><p>“<a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/presentations/NonconformistKeynoteWeb20200702.pdf">Trans-contextual value transfer</a>,” is the answer, in economic terms, my colleague Dr. Sam Smith would use, the ability to efficiently move value between the very different contexts of ships, trucks, and trains. By moving the entire container, and not emptying it until it has reached its final destination, the break-bulk process was eliminated entirely, causing a precipitous drop in shipping times and overall transaction costs. Stunningly, the price to unload one ton of goods fell from <a href="https://traderiskguaranty.com/trgpeak/history-shipping-containers/">$5.86 in 1956 to only $.16&nbsp;today</a>.</p><p>Whenever transaction costs are reduced there is an increase in transactions proportional to the reduction¹, and that is exactly what happened.</p><p>Bridging contexts in any arena is hard, and expensive, but the gains from discovering how to do it efficiently can be enormous. Standardized shipping containers bridged physical contexts between ships, trains, and trucks and changed the world forever; VCs will do a similar thing for data, lowering transaction costs by efficiently bridging contexts between trust&nbsp;domains.</p> VCs Do for Data What Shipping Containers Did for Physical&nbsp;Goods <a href="http://www.exlindia.com/train-cargo-3/">http://www.exlindia.com/train-cargo-3/</a><p>Trust domains and how VCs bridge them, mechanically, is the subject of Part 3 of this series, “<a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/how-verifiable-credentials-bridge-trust-domains-97155d0f3c17">How VCs Bridge Trust Domains</a>,” and so will not be treated fully here, but a quick summary seems appropriate.</p><p>The current process of moving trusted data between unconnected organizations is uncannily similar to the break-bulk shipping process prior to 1956: data must be carefully removed from the data containers of the sending organization and re-packaged into the data containers of the receiving organization. As an example, just ask anyone in the know how academic transcripts in the U.S. are really exchanged between schools today: it is manual, slow, complicated, expensive, and often requires the paid help of 3rd-party intermediaries. Again, this is strikingly similar to break-bulk.</p><p>VCs address this chasm how shipping containers did. Data senders (“issuers”) and data receivers (“verifiers”) first agree on a standardized container². Issuers pack VCs with a desired payload and then issue it, either to the wallet of an individual “holder” or into storage in a database or blockchain. When verified, the verifier can rely on the fidelity of the data payload because they can <a href="https://link.medium.com/Jj8ynRY0e8">verify the provenance and fidelity of the container it came in</a>, and critically, perform that verification cryptographically without contacting the&nbsp;issuer.</p><p>We don’t yet know to what degree VCs will reduce costs. Earlier I cited the more than 95% drop in costs shipping containers delivered; that level of efficiency wasn’t fully realized until most ships, trains, and trucks had made modifications to adhere to the standards and were in full production. The same thing will happen with VCs. While it will take some time, with the complete elimination of “break-bulk”-style data exchange, and of the then-obsolete data middlemen and their associated time, cost, and manual processes, the cost reduction will be&nbsp;massive.</p><p>When comparing VCs and shipping containers, you discover the nature of the problem they address is similar, the way they address it is similar, and the size of the markets — global physical trade and global e-commerce — is arguably similar. It follows that the reduction in transactions costs, proportional increase in transactions, and overall economic impact would be similar,&nbsp;too.</p> VCs Unlock Global Network&nbsp;Effects <p>Another, related dimension of the economic impact VCs will have on the digital economy, and one that’s more familiar than shipping containers but potentially just as impactful, is network&nbsp;effects.</p><p>VCs enable a powerful kind of network effect, a cooperative network-of-networks effect. Deeper research into how SSI and VCs enable cooperative network effects has been done by Dr. Samuel Smith, my partner at Digital Trust Ventures, in his seminal paper, <a href="https://medium.com/selfrule/meta-platforms-and-cooperative-network-of-networks-effects-6e61eb15c586">Meta-Platforms and Cooperative Network-of-Networks Effects</a>, so I will only summarize Sam’s findings&nbsp;here.</p><p>When networks “cooperate,” some value from one network is transferable to another. Cooperative network effects are inter-network and exponentially greater than intra-network effects, like comparing the internet to AOL. To understand cooperative network effects it’s helpful to first understand its cousin: competitive network effects³.</p><p>The ride sharing industry offers an excellent example of competitive network effects. When Uber acquires a new driver, that driver becomes more likely to also drive for Lyft, Uber’s direct competitor. Though Uber and Lyft may wish it were not so, every driver and rider gained by one network is just clicks away from being gained by the other, which is unfortunate for whoever spent large sums to first gain them. This effect accelerates competition, adds price pressure, and sows the seeds of mass defection if it ever becomes advisable. Of course there is a selfishly beneficial tradeoff too, when your network gains from another’s expansion.</p><p>In contrast, cooperative network-of-network effects occur when growth in one network benefits other, non-competitive networks. Literally, customers gained in one network or industry are accretive to other, non-competitive and even completely unrelated networks or industries.</p><p>For example, several credit unions (CUs) in the U.S. are now issuing VCs to members to enable a secure, streamlined experience when they call in, walk in, or log in; they call it <a href="https://www.memberpass.com">MemberPass</a>. While the first use cases are limited to within the issuing CU, any entity in any industry could also choose to accept MemberPass and offer a sleek onboarding and login experience that eliminates forms and passwords for anyone presenting one. What website wouldn’t prefer instant onboarding and authentication of new customers presenting cryptographically verifiable credentials issued by regulated U.S. financial institutions, instead of the friction of forms, usernames, and breachable passwords they’re forced to offer&nbsp;today?</p><p>Every new MemberPass issued becomes a new, easily onboardable prospective customer for any entity anywhere that accepts VCs, online or off. And value flows both ways, as CUs benefit from increased satisfaction whenever members successfully use MemberPass, from increased value provided to members and the loyalty that engenders, and from increased demand for MemberPass from both existing and prospective CU&nbsp;members.</p><p>These are cooperative network effects indeed, as they foster cross-industry collaboration. The only obstacle is awareness.</p><p>This kind of cooperation between unrelated networks, both intentional and unintentional, has rarely been observed or achievable, but with VCs becomes predictable. The resulting ‘meta’ network effects — <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/presentations/NonconformistKeynoteWeb20200702.pdf">Smith’s Law</a> — are exponential compared to intra-network effects, and also beyond <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/29066/metcalfes-law">Metcalfe’s Law</a>. If you’re a student of the science of network effects, be sure to check out <a href="https://medium.com/selfrule/meta-platforms-and-cooperative-network-of-networks-effects-6e61eb15c586">Sam’s paper</a>. You’re in for a treat; the math for this is incredible.</p> In Conclusion <p>Shipping containers were a once-in-a-lifetime improvement in global trade, forever bridging the physical barriers between ships, trains, and trucks. VCs are the shipping containers of the digital realm, bridging trust domain barriers between organizations, departments, and even internal&nbsp;silos.</p><p>Shipping containers brought an unprecedented multi-decade, multi-trillion-dollar global economic expansion by dramatically reducing transaction costs for physical goods; VCs will do the same for digital goods, and economically change the world to a similar magnitude.</p><p>If that were VCs only economic value, it would be more than enough. VCs also enable cooperative network-of-network effects, where issuances in one industry can benefit other, non-competitive industries, potentially many of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Excited yet?

Between issuers and verifiers there is typically a human carrying the VC in a standardized SSI digital wallet, but VCs can also be transported in other ways, or stored in a relational database¹ or a distributed ledger².</p><p>The payload of a VC can be any kind of data and is not limited to what might normally be considered a credential.</p><p>In fact, the word “credential” is a holdover from the worlds of identity and academia, where VCs began their standardization journey and have many important use cases. But recently I’ve seen people in academia get confused when the payload inside a VC is what the academic world calls a credential — like a diploma or a transcript — resulting in a credential within a (verifiable) credential. Others get confused when the VC payload isn’t a credential, in either academic or identity parlance, but we still call the VC a credential.</p><p>Now that VCs have the global momentum they do, I feel we need to “open the aperture” beyond identity and credentials. Here are some example VC payloads not typically considered credentials, all of which become cryptographically verifiable when delivered as a payload within a&nbsp;VC:</p>  Consent, permissions, votes,&nbsp;opinions  Balances, totals, deficits, ranges, statistics, source&nbsp;data  Statements, agreements, contracts, invoices, sources  Confirmations, acknowledgements, attestations, assertions, affidavits  The speed, trajectory, weight, temperature or location of&nbsp;anything  Laws, regulations, statutes, rules, orders, decrees, declarations  Photos, videos, music,&nbsp;messages  Software code, hashes, files, the state of a database at a given point in&nbsp;time  Tests, procedures, prescriptions, diagnoses  <p>Of course, objects typically considered credentials make ideal VC payloads:</p>  Identities, names, addresses, usernames, titles, attributes, profiles, bios  Licenses, passports, visas, permits, tickets, coupons, vouchers, receipts  Skills, competencies, certificates, badges, diplomas, degrees, achievements, awards  Identifiers, codes, account numbers, ticket&nbsp;numbers  <p>It is true that the identity- and achievement-related use cases in this second list are those most actively being pursued in the VC space right now, and many in the first list cannot be realized until there’s broader adoption by issuers and verifiers. Still, the word “credential” has a specific meaning in several industries, and it is consistently confusing to VC noobs for one simple reason: it is an inaccurate term for what a VC really is and&nbsp;does.</p><p>Truly, “Verifiable Credentials” should be renamed to “Verifiable Containers.” I can’t think of anything important we lose by doing so, and can think of much clarity and other benefits (detailed in this series) that we would gain. Of all the gnarly terminology challenges we face in the SSI space, this one seems like a slam dunk to&nbsp;me.</p> Containers Inside of Containers Is a Feature, Not a&nbsp;Bug <a href="http://www.rubylane.com/item/712219-T118-121814-3/Russian-Matryoshka-Dolls-Nesting-Dolls">http://www.rubylane.com/item/712219-T118-121814-3/Russian-Matryoshka-Dolls-Nesting-Dolls</a><p>On several occasions I’ve been asked something like: “We already have containers for learning achievements with <a href="https://openbadges.org/">Open Badges</a>; why do we need another container?”</p><p>A fair question, but it presumes containers inside of containers aren’t useful or necessary for data, which isn’t necessarily the&nbsp;case.</p><p>Life is full of containers inside of containers. Products at the store come in boxes that arrived in larger boxes, stacked with other boxes onto a crate, which itself is another container, often shipped inside shipping containers, which are carried in/on the containers of ships, trains, and trucks. Data is stored inside files within folders, within other folders, inside of directories, inside of virtual machines, inside of partitions, inside a hard drive, within an enclosure, inside a computer, often on a shelf within a rack within a room inside a building.</p><p>You get the&nbsp;point.</p><p>Each level of container has a purpose and adds value and efficiency to the whole chain; try taking one away and it gets messy. Sub-specialties and entire industries are built up around the containers at each level, and they often don’t know much about the containers at the other levels. The people operating giant cranes at a port don’t know or care much about what’s inside the containers they’re moving, and they don’t need&nbsp;to.</p>CREDIT: Cam&nbsp;Geer<p>Even though it is a container itself, like any file a VC must be held in another container: a database, blockchain, or preferably a standardized SSI wallet. If a wallet, that wallet must be held in another container that makes it usable, like a smartphone, a USB stick or even a chipped&nbsp;card.</p><p>A VC can hold any sort of data payload, even as simple as a clear-text “Yes” or “No” when granting or refusing consent. If the payload is more advanced, like an academic achievement, it should be encoded in a way that provides semantic meaning to a verifier, such as an <a href="https://www.imsglobal.org/activity/comprehensive-learner-record">IMS Comprehensive Learner Record</a> (CLR). When a CLR is a VC’s payload, it’s an achievement inside of a CLR container inside of a VC container likely inside of a wallet. Take away the CLR container and you lose some semantic meaning for verifiers; take away the VC container and you lose the ability for CLRs to become portable alongside other, non-CLR payloads, forcing CLR users to adopt special capabilities unique to CLRs. If you repeat that specialized thinking for every kind of payload, from academia to healthcare to government, you quickly get back to a world full of bespoke containers and troublesome trust domains, right back where we&nbsp;started.</p><p>This is why a standardized shipping container for data is needed, and just as useful as its physical analog. Whether physical or digital, it’s Russian dolls everywhere you look, and that’s a good&nbsp;thing.</p> VC Containers Are Always Verifiable; Payloads Are&nbsp;Not <p>As with any container, with VCs it’s GIGO: garbage in, garbage out. The only thing that’s always verifiable with a VC is the container itself, where a verifier can cryptographically verify its fidelity, but not always the veracity of the&nbsp;payload.</p><p>For example, ABC University could issue to you a VC with this statement: “blue is green.” Clearly blue is not green and someone was messing around, but we can still verify four elements of the VC’s fidelity:</p>  ABCU issued&nbsp;it;  They issued it to&nbsp;you;  It has/hasn’t been tampered with since it was&nbsp;issued;  ABCU has/hasn’t revoked&nbsp;it.  <p>Knowing who packed the container establishes the VC’s provenance to a specific issuer and directly influences a verifier’s willingness to rely on its payload, which is why many conflate this issue and believe that payloads are verifiable. But it is a significant distinction; a verifier can confirm that a VC container is authentic and from a trustworthy source, but still decide not to rely on its payload. (A payload can often be separately verifiable in some way, such as an Open Badge or even another VC, but that is beside the point&nbsp;here.)</p><p>This is how physical credentials work, too. A physical passport is a container that holds data (though only one type of highly regulated data); it is the physical container the airport verifies when you present it to them. Then, upon concluding the container is authentic, the airport usually proceeds to rely upon the data within the presented container. VCs function in the same manner but in the digital realm, and capable of carrying any data payload, which makes them far more flexible, useful, and powerful overall than physical credentials.</p><p>Of course, you don’t need a battery to share your driver’s license, so there’s that. But then again your passport and driver’s license can — and I believe will — become chipped³ and carry VCs just as chipped EMV payment cards carry other bits of data, no batteries required, so there’s that,&nbsp;too.</p> In Conclusion <p>If it’s true that VCs aren’t really credentials, and that calling them credentials often confuses people coming into the space, then we should seriously consider not calling them credentials.</p><p>The fact that VCs are containers capable of carrying any sort of verifiable data payload isn’t just a good thing, it’s a great one. And as you’ll read in parts 2 and <a href="https://medium.com/p/97155d0f3c17/edit">3</a> of this series, it has the potential to change the world as much as the shipping container did, and that’s a big deal. A huge&nbsp;one.</p><p>Finally, it is useful to put other data containers inside of VCs, and maybe even containers inside of those containers, all riding along and benefiting from the portability between trust domains enabled by a Verifiable Credential.</p><p>Or should we say, “Verifiable Container”?</p><p>This article is part 1 of a 3-part&nbsp;series:</p><p>Part 2: <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/like-shipping-containers-verifiable-credentials-will-economically-transform-the-world-fece2b9da14a">Like Shipping Containers, Verifiable Credentials Will Economically Transform the&nbsp;World</a></p><p>Part 3: <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/how-verifiable-credentials-bridge-trust-domains-97155d0f3c17">How Verifiable Credentials Bridge Trust&nbsp;Domains</a></p><p>¹ Example: BC Gov (British Columbia) Verifiable Organization Network: <a href="https://vonx.io/">https://vonx.io/</a><br>² Examples: <a href="https://www.velocitynetwork.foundation/">https://www.velocitynetwork.foundation/</a> and <a href="https://trust.asu.edu/">https://trust.asu.edu/</a><br>³ German ID cards (“Personalausweis”) are chipped and NFC-accessible through a corresponding app. See <a href="https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ausweisapp.bund.de%2Fausweisapp2%2F">here</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bmi.bund.de%2FDE%2Fthemen%2Fmoderne-verwaltung%2Fausweise-und-paesse%2Fonline-ausweisfunktion%2Fonline-ausweisfunktion-node.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>日本の企業は「プライバシー・ポリシー」なるものを多くの場合公表しておられると思います。しかし、残念ながらその多くは、発表している企業を守るためのものになっていて、法律的な文書を読み慣れない一般人には到底理解不能なものになっています。これに対して本来の「プライバシー・ポリシー」は、どのようにデータが扱われるのかを本人やその他のステークホルダーに伝えるものでなければなりません。</p>

<p>Well!  Morgan and I have co-launched a new podcast called
<a href="https://fossandcrafts.org/">FOSS and Crafts</a>!
As the title implies, it's going to be a fairly interdisciplinary
podcast... the title says it all fairly nicely I think: "A podcast
about free software, free culture, and making things together."</p>
<p>We already have the <a href="https://fossandcrafts.org/">intro episode</a> out!
It's fairly intro-episode'y... meet the hosts, hear about what to expect
from the show, etc etc... but we do talk a bit about some background
of the name!</p>
<p>But more substantial episodes will be out soon.
We have a lot of plans and ideas for the show, and I've got a pretty
good setup for editing/publishing now.
So if that sounds fun, subscribe, and more stuff should be hitting
your ears soon!</p>
<p>(PS: we have a nice little community growing in
<a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=fossandcrafts">#fossandcrafts on irc.freenode.net</a>
if you're into that kind of thing!)</p>

<p><a href="https://twit.tv/shows/floss-weekly/episodes/586"></a></p>
<p>I don’t want to explain why we’re bivouac’d at a friend’s house in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Marino,_California">San Marino</a>. What matters, for the purpose of this post, is that we wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>But hey, it’s a nice house in a nice town.&nbsp;My only complaint is that there’s nothing resembling an office desk or chair here. I’ve coped by collecting my ass and my electronics within an arrangement of mostly antique furniture. That’s what you see in the screenshot above. (From my <a href="https://twit.tv/shows/floss-weekly/episodes/586">most recent</a> <a href="https://twit.tv/shows/floss-weekly">Floss Weekly</a> podcast.) The rest of the house looks kinda like the set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knives_Out">Knives Out</a>.</p>
<p>I start with this setting because a friend asked me to write my own version of what Francine <a href="https://medium.com/@hardaway">@Hardaway</a> published today in <a href="https://medium.com/aging-revealed/releasing-your-former-life-9233e27c603a">Releasing My Former Life</a>. (It’s a good piece. Go read it. I also thank Francine for turning me on to #Clubhouse. It is <a href="https://bluetree.ai/clubhouse-voice-chat-app/">reportedly</a> invite-only and apparently website-less, but I’m hoping she or a reader can get me one. Or two.)</p>
<p>So, what to report?</p>
<p>Well, in pre-pandemic times my wife and I were on the road at least a third of the time, so we’re used to operating out of hotel rooms, conference spaces and seats by the gates of departing flights at airports. So living in places other than home is not odd for us. It is odd to go around wearing masks in public while keeping our distance, as if everyone had just farted; but we hardly go out at all. We provision the kitchen here with runs to Trader Joe’s or Costco on days when they open early for geezers, and that only happens every couple weeks or so. Also, this region isn’t one of those in denial of the pandemic. People here tend to have Fauci-compliant public health practices.</p>
<p>In the early mornings or late evenings, when it’s not 95° outside, I do venture out for walks of 2-3 miles or more in the neighborhood. The roads are wide here, and the pedestrian traffic is light, so I leave the mask off most of the time. There are also lots of amazing trees and gardens, so I’ll pause to admire those and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/docsearls">post occasional photos of interesting stuff on Instagram</a>. (This kind of thing, by the way, comprises almost my entire experience of Instagram.)</p>
<p>While paying work has taken a hit, I remain overcommitted to all the obligations I had before the pandemic arrived, plus a couple new ones, such as the Floss Weekly podcast. It bothers me that I’m not as efficient or as effective in that work as I’d like, but being bothered about it isn’t the same as being depressed or anxious. It just kinda sucks.</p>
<p>Other stuff…</p>
 
 <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2011/04/05/dorothy-parker-quote-question/">Dorothy Parker</a>&nbsp;said (or is said to have said) that she preferred the company of younger men “because their stories are shorter.” I am mindful of that. I also know it’s way too easy to talk about infirmities that accumulate, lengthen and get more complicated with age. So I avoid writing, thinking or talking about being old, even though it keeps me up at night, mostly because I have to pee. 
 I’m optimistic about the long-run future, though the short run will surely get worse before it gets better. (Bad things happen when people die at wartime rates and large hunks of the economy are turned off.) I could say more about that, but I won’t, because— 
 There is far more than enough political writing and talk. Sure, I fantasize about speaking up, because I do think I have some useful things to say. I just don’t expect what I say to make a bit of difference. The noise level is so high right now, and the effect level of any given tweet or post is so low, that I’m disinclined to say much. Add that to what I said <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2014/08/03/snow-on-the-water/">here in 2014</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2020/05/15/fossil/">here two months ago</a>, and you’ll see why I’d mostly rather work on other stuff. 
 
<p>The main thing for me right now is&nbsp;<a href="http://customercommons.org/">Customer Commons</a>. If it succeeds, it will be the most leveraged thing I’ve ever done, meaning the best for the world. If you’re interested in helping, drop me an email. First name at last name dot com. Thanks.</p>

			<p>#BlackLivesMatter #NewYorkCity</p>
		
	

         
<p>I took advantage of the new City Bike dock in front of our flat to ride 80
blocks south through Central Park today to see the new <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/07/black-lives-matter-painted-on-street-outside-trump-tower.html" title="‘Black Lives Matter’ Painted on Fifth Avenue Outside Trump Tower">#BlackLivesMatter mural</a>
outside Trump Tower. Not too many people around, perhaps a dozen taking photos
and selfies. I joined them, then took a photo for a couple and their toddler in
front of the mural. I couldn’t stop grinning under my mask. The mural may be
symbolic, but holy cats do symbols matter.</p>
<p>More photos <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CCjMEw-ptAg/">on Instagram</a>.</p>
<p>Also, what a great ride this was. Thinking about quitting my job just to wander
around New York and take it all in. Love this city.</p>

is soo great. In a few cogent, direct, clear paragraphs, she covers her views on
quarantine, Covid, reading, pregnancy, capitalism, Black Lives Matter, policy
changes, protest, climate change, and more. An example, on white discomfort:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m also suspicious of the way that Not Being Racist is a project that people
seem to be approaching like boot camp. To deepen your understanding of race,
of this country, should make you feel like the world is opening up, like
you’re dissolving into the immensity of history and the present rather than
being more uncomfortably visible to yourself. Reading more Black writers isn’t
like taking medicine. People ought to seek out the genuine pleasure of
decentering themselves, and read fiction and history alongside these popular
anti-racist manuals, and not feel like they need to calibrate their precise
degree of guilt and goodness all the time.</p>

<p>My <a href="https://identiverse.com/">Identiverse</a> 2020 talk Enabling Scalable Multi-lateral Federations with OpenID Connect was just broadcast and is <a href="https://onlinexperiences.com/Launch/Event/ShowKey=96621">available for viewing</a>.  The talk abstract is:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Numerous large-scale multi-lateral identity federations are in production use today, primarily in the Research and Education sector.  These include national federations, such as SWAMID in Sweden and InCommon in the US, some with thousands of sites, and inter-federations among dozens of federations, such as eduGAIN.  Yet these existing federations are based on SAML 2 and require the federation operator to poll the participants for their metadata, concatenating it into a huge file that is distributed to all federation participants nightly – a brittle process with significant scalability problems.</p>
<p>Responding to demand from the Research and Education community to migrate from SAML 2 to the simpler OpenID Connect protocol, the OpenID Connect working group has created the OpenID Connect Federation specification to enable this.  The new approach incorporates lessons learned from existing SAML 2 federations – especially using a new, scalable approach to federation metadata, in which organizations host their own signed metadata and federation operators in turn sign statements about the organizations that are participants in the federation.  As Shibboleth author Scott Cantor publicly said at a federation conference, “Given all my experience, if I were to redo the metadata handling today, I would do it along the lines in the OpenID Connect Federation specification”.</p>
<p>This presentation will describe progress implementing and deploying OpenID Connect Federation, upcoming interop events and results, and next steps to complete the specification and foster production deployments.  The resulting feedback from Identiverse participants on the approach will be highly valuable.</p></blockquote>
<p>As a late-breaking addition, data from the June 2020 Federation interop event organized by <a href="https://twitter.com/RolandHedberg">Roland Hedberg</a> was included in the presentation.</p>

  Do you serve a problem or do you solve a problem?<br><br>Serving problems is lucrative work.<br><br>Solving problems is valuable work.<br><br>Extracting the value from your service of problems is done in completely different ways than from solving problems. People who solve problems are the innovators, the entrepreneurs, the social-benefactors that move our species forward. People who serve problems benefit from the existence of problems to serve.<br><br>This is a profoundly important distinction to understand in the constitution of any Society. People do the work they are enticed to do. Work is valued in any number of ways, and markets form systems based on the repeatability of a task, or behavior, or contract model.<br><br>Contracts define the repeatability of actions. Solving problems ends the service loop provided by those people that benefit from the existence of problems to serve. All around the industrialized world, people are serving problems. Little problems that are solved with button pushes, and big problems that require emotional investment.. both are being solved by people. Solving those problems in a different manner than they are being served creates a new problem:<br><br>What will people who serve problems do if someone solves the problem that they serve?<br><br>The extinction of problems is a HUGE problem for people that are dependent on the existence of problems to serve for their own well-being. Do you see the loop? Do you sense the problem?<br><br>Meta-thinkers that can escape this loop and apply their attention to the solving of problems are the greatest agents of change possible in the Human species. All over the world, the fear of the future is taking over immature psychologies. People who fear their own ability to take care of their needs, to have enough to get by, or to prosper with adequate health, wealth and wisdom through life's required challenges, are falling victim to a very predictable mental deficiency.<br><br>The unpredictability of life is not unique, it is the status quo. Change is constant, and people are here to solve the problems that life is composed of. Serving problems is an industrial era monetization of the permanence of problems. Government think tanks of eras gone by persist this logic pattern and operational mandate in order to extract rent from the existence of problems they, and their cronies, service.<br><br>Service models that help problems persist exist definitively in 2020 as political platforms. Creating problems from the raw material of modern life, recycling problems that are rehashed from dead history, joining problems in endless propaganda cycles that induce fear, compliance, and predictable work-patterns is how problem-servers maintain their authority in Society.<br><br>People are manipulated into believing, into accepting the idea that the servants of persistent problems, and problem-cycles that never end, are here to help them. People buy into these ideas in good faith, because they think that these "good people" serving their problems are their friends helping them overcome, when in fact they are the barnacles riding shotgun on the energy of the problem that is being served for the benefit of the party being directly affected by the problem, as well as the party earning a paycheck via their service of the problem.<br><br>Never-ending cycles of oppression are the result when the servants of problems show up on the scene. In the name of social justice, of workers rights, or child welfare, of education, of health care, of drug enforcement, and many other problems, servants of problems loot the world of value in a never-ending cycle of servitude. Problems persist indefinitely, incremental improvements ebb and flow, and people believe in servants that become parties with platforms.. servants of problems.. VOTE DEMOCRAT!<br><br>Problem solvers are different.<br><br>Problem solvers are disruptors.<br><br>Problem solvers end service cycles, and give new capabilities to Individual people. ALWAYS to Individual people, empowerment solutions are delivered directly to the experience where people have problems. This is the critical distinction, as Individuals we begin, as Individuals we remain.. for our entire life, one person will travel with you for the duration. One.<br><br>One among many other ones, this is our species Humanity.<br><br>Solving human problems is the highest order work there is. People solving problems is as close as we will ever come to the purpose of human life. People helping people solve problems, everyday.. constantly, new problems is the raw material of enlightenment, and equality for enlightened people.<br><br>There is no other condition that intercedes as more important than being human, and solving problems.<br><br>Mob rulers need mob thinkers, to enforce their service model to problems. People will never solve a problem so long as they are held captive to the servants of problems. When you vote, vote not for the servants of Society's problems, but for the people that solve problems.<br><br>Vote for the actual, functional leader. Vote for your operational existence, vote for the solution to real problems, and look for the distinction between problems that can be solved, and problems that exist so that they can be serviced.<br><br>This will help you immensely in your life, and it will solve a major problem for all of Humanity.<br><br><br><br><br>

<p>去る7月1日に次のような記事が流れてきました。</p>



<a href="https://www.itmedia.co.jp/enterprise/articles/2007/01/news062.html?bpc=93b2579766e17e5f0383ca6e14b267441c866c19c93385b8da1cf42098d5b19e"></a>



<p>ただ、この記事からだけだと、結局どういう脆弱性なのかわかりませんし、Palo Alto Networks のサイトの<a href="https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/CVE-2020-2021">当該ページ</a>に行っても同様です。ここのところ忙しくてなかなか手が回らなかったのですが、今日土曜日は仕事をしないと決めていたのでちょっと調べてみました。といっても、他の文献をあたっただけですが。</p>



<p>その中で詳しくて良いと思ったのが、<a href="https://www.tenable.com/blog/cve-2020-2021-palo-alto-networks-pan-os-vulnerable-to-critical-authentication-bypass">tenable</a>の解説です。</p>



 攻撃成功の前提条件 



<p>それによると、この攻撃が成功するためには次の２つの前提条件があります。</p>



  SAML認証をおこなっていること。  IdPの証明書の検証を行わない設定になっていること。  



(図1) &nbsp;<a href="https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/9-0/pan-os-web-interface-help/device/device-server-profiles-saml-identity-provider.html">SAML Identity Provider Server Profile configuration</a>画面 (Source) <a href="https://www.tenable.com/blog/cve-2020-2021-palo-alto-networks-pan-os-vulnerable-to-critical-authentication-bypass">tenable</a>



<p>「IdPの証明書の検証を行わないなってことあるの？」と思われるかも知れませんが、これはかなり普通のことです。自己署名証明書を使う場合がこれで、いわばRaw Keyを使っている状態ということになります。上記の記事によると、実際に以下の製品ではこの設定を推奨しているようです。</p>



  <a href="https://saml-doc.okta.com/SAML_Docs/How-to-Configure-SAML-2.0-for-Palo-Alto-Networks-GlobalProtect.html">Okta</a>&nbsp;[<a href="https://www.tenable.com/sites/drupal.dmz.tenablesecurity.com/files/images/blog/okta-saml-validate-identity-provider-certificate.png">Image</a>]  <a href="https://docs.secureauth.com/display/91docs/Palo+Alto+SAML+Single+Sign-on+Deployment+Guide">SecureAuth</a>&nbsp;[<a href="https://www.tenable.com/sites/drupal.dmz.tenablesecurity.com/files/images/blog/secureauth-saml-validate-identity-provider-certificate.png">Image</a>]  <a href="https://resources.safenetid.com/help/Palo%20Alto%20GlobalProtect/Index.htm">SafeNet Trusted Access</a>&nbsp;[<a href="https://www.tenable.com/sites/drupal.dmz.tenablesecurity.com/files/images/blog/safenet-trusted-access-saml-validate-identity-provider-certificate.png">Image</a>]  <a href="https://duo.com/docs/paloalto-sso">Duo</a>&nbsp;[<a href="https://www.tenable.com/sites/drupal.dmz.tenablesecurity.com/files/images/blog/duo-security-saml-validate-identity-provider-certificate.png">Image</a>]  <a href="https://docs.trusona.com/integrations/pan-global-protect-aad/">Trusona</a>&nbsp;via&nbsp;<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/active-directory/">Azure AD</a>&nbsp;[<a href="https://www.tenable.com/sites/drupal.dmz.tenablesecurity.com/files/images/blog/trusona-azuread-saml-validate-identity-provider-certificate.png">Image</a>]  <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/paloaltoadmin-tutorial">Azure&nbsp;AD</a>&nbsp;[<a href="https://www.tenable.com/sites/drupal.dmz.tenablesecurity.com/files/images/blog/azure-ad-saml-validate-identity-provider-certificate.png">Image</a>]  <a href="https://centrify.force.com/support/servlet/fileField?retURL=%2Fsupport%2Fapex%2FCentrify_KB_ArtDetail%3FId%3DkA01E0000000Q3wSAE%26search%3D&amp;entityId=ka01E0000000oTAQAY&amp;field=Attachment_1__Body__s">Centrify</a>&nbsp;[<a href="https://www.tenable.com/sites/drupal.dmz.tenablesecurity.com/files/images/blog/centrify-saml-validate-identity-provider-certificate.png">Image</a>]  



<p>メジャーどころ勢揃いですね。そして、セキュリティ的にはこれで問題ありません。</p>



 何が起きているのか？ 



<p>さて、では、お待ちかねのセキュリティホールの内容です。(図１)の設定で省略されるのは、IdPが署名に使う証明書のCertificate ChainとRevocationのチェックを省略するだけのはずですよね？ところが、実際には、SAML Assertionに対するIdPの署名の検証まで省略してしまっていたようなのです。すべてのSAML Assertionへの署名の検証が省略されるのか、ある特定の条件のときなのかはわかりませんが、その条件にあたれば、管理者の権限まで取られてしまうことは確かなようです。なので、重大性MAXの脆弱性〜VPNで守っているつもりでもまったく守られていない状態〜にあたるわけですね。</p>



<p>ITメディアの記事を最初に読んだときには「署名検証の不備」と書かれていたので、またXML署名におけるXML正規化由来の署名バイパスかと思って、</p>



 
<blockquote><p>XMLDSig の署名検証は人類には早すぎた。＞ Palo Alto Networks製品のSAML認証に危険度最大の脆弱性、米サイバー軍も注意喚起 <a href="https://t.co/1usvMmpwOX">https://t.co/1usvMmpwOX</a></p>— 崎村夏彦 (=nat) (@_nat) <a href="https://twitter.com/_nat/status/1278750585026576385?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 2, 2020</a></blockquote>
 



<p>と書いたのですが、どうやらそうではなくて、「PKIは人類には早すぎた」問題だったようです。</p>



 対策 



<p>対策は２種類あります。</p>



  PaloAltoネットワークが出したパッチを当てる。  すぐにパッチが当てられないならば、IdPの使う証明書を自己署名ではなくCAが発行したものに変え、IdPの証明書の検証を行うようにすること。  



<p>です。まだ、実際の攻撃はされていないようですが、可及的速やかに対策する必要がありますのでご注意ください。</p><p>The post <a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2020/07/4650/">調べてみた＞「PaloAlto Networks製品のSAML認証に危険度最大の脆弱性米サイバー軍も注意喚起」</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.sakimura.org/">@_Nat Zone</a>.</p>

  In 2008, my new family had a 3 year old child, a young international toy design and distribution company, and a newly emerging indie educational technology non-profit to take care of and grow with all the daily intensities you can imagine. Money? Yeah, we were working our butts off to survive and prosper with ideas and implementations that had very little support to fall back on if something went wrong. Health care? Yeah, we paid for it ourselves.<br><br>Then came ObamaCare. You might of heard about it. I watched the news, wondering if our Government would do something right for a change. Then reality started to sink in. The "Individual Mandate" was a perversion of the system I knew, and was an ugly administrative overreach that looked desperate in its attempt to force participation. Every part of that program was devised to support the non-working class, or the employed-class of people. As an entrepreneur funding my own survival, and any hope of quality of care or prosperity, I was not a consideration. Months later, after its passage, this reality become solidified. My family lost the health care it was paying for independently.<br><br>I was a casualty of progress, right? A method of socialized health care was being promoted as a savior for the people of my country, when in fact, it was being experienced in just the opposite way by an actual American family. It took me many years to solve this problem, but eventually I did so. It is called DevCare... and I provide it to 9 people who work for me plus their families. I spend $60,000+ per year providing health care to the people I employ. It works, and it works really well.<br><br>ObamaCare? Yeah.. that was pure socialist BS. That was never a solution to a problem, it was a redesign of dependency, forced upon Americans by a President and Congress hell-bent on changing America from a place where an "American Dream" of self-possession, private ownership, free-enterprise and hard work paid off. Instead, we all got equalized.. as Medicare dependents.<br><br>So along the way, after years doing private toy development, and licensing under brands as well known as "Imaginarium" from Toys R Us, we folded shop. It was time to move on. Doing business in China was not going to go well for anyone anymore. The writing was on the wall. "Move along"....<br><br>My kid, in the meantime, had entered the public school system, specifically because I wanted him to have an experience of learning with the public in my country. We lived in an extremely rural location, and 60%+ of the students attending our school received federally subsidized lunches. So in order to make sure the school produced at the level I hoped, my wife and I volunteered. She became the President of the PTA, and I donated my time and resources to introduce kids to robotics, programming, and art/math/logic that can move while you learn about it. Along the way, some local-yocal parents complained that our activities were going to steal jobs from the local contractor-economy, and should be shut-down. I shit you not. The school Principal was smarter than that, and we continued volunteering.. at least until 2nd grade.<br><br>That was the end of my public school experience. In 2nd grade, we exceeded the capacity of the public school system in the United States of America. There was no other choice... move, pay for private school that "might" be better, or do it yourself... home school... or leave the religious stuff out and just "indie school". So we did so... we built a company that supports multiple families while educating our own child indie school style.<br><br>And we moved... to New York.. to Long Island, where accessing independent learning was much easier than in Virginia. Where economics was something that had velocity, and all sectors were present in everyday life... not separated by scores of miles, stored on Dulles Toll Road, or in communities trying to overcome their racist past like Charlottesville.<br><br>And along the way, we had an experience that was completely unexpected; others saw the world and the problems being created at the hands of socialist Governors as we did. Individual mandates were seen as communist over-reaches, regardless of media propaganda controlling the masses of dependents. And being an entrepreneur, building and teaching, and leading the world towards "functional literacy" and "functional identity" by sourcing everyone with the ideas behind self-Sovereign identity, starting in President Obama's own $10million effort called NSTC, started picking up steam.<br><br>But socialists do one thing well... they clone value so they can deplete it. They loot, to be more precise. And by becoming visible, and sharing problem:solution outcomes, I was exposing myself to a ravenous community of socialist looters, both in Washington DC and Silicon Valley. No one survives that onslaught, right? With a social graph documenting all the relationships and hidden beliefs of Americans, and Government making dependency the law of the land, producing functional literacy on the part of American's was becoming increasingly challenging.<br><br>"If you are not a socialist in your 20's, you have no heart. If you are not a capitalist by your 30's, you have no brain".. not sure that is an actual quote anybody ever said, but it makes sense in observable reality.<br><br>I was raised by a Teacher, a social worker who believed she could solve the worlds problems by caring enough, even if practicable financial literacy was a mystery concept. I come from a family of educators, economists, a learned people.. and I respect all their ideas and practices to help the world be a better place, and people be better citizens.<br><br>But I am not one to swallow conformity, and I am not one to wait for my dependencies to be served by a Governing system that can not accurately define them, let along respect the life, liberty or pursuit of happiness that Individuals create in my country.<br><br>So with all the "Hope" in the world for "Change I could Believe in" I decided to go a different route. I decided to solve my own problems. To stand up my own Rights. To demonstrate what a functional American is, and to mentor others to overcome the false education system based on "Credentials of Exclusion" that exists to provide employment first, and education next. Jobs, Jobs Jobs!<br><br>Sure, a "Union of Workers" seems like a decent concept within a "More Perfect Union".. but is it? The USSR (Russia) was formed for just that purpose...&nbsp; a "Union of Workers". More importantly, how is a "More Perfect Union" made possible by sub-Unions, or operational cults in most cases, that demand loyalty from their participants and black-ball any and all non-believers who step out of line?<br><br>America in 2020 has a thinking problem to overcome. It has induced an operational problem wherein data slaves functioning on a data plantation believe they are "FREE", when in fact they are anything but. Labor is owned by the State, Identity is provisioned by the State, and compliance is not optional.<br><br>Is that even Constitutionally accurate? No, but then again, the Constitution does not compute in 2020. How can it ever hope to be accurate in rendering the operational format of participation for citizens when it can not even be designed effectively at root participation for American babies with any sense of accuracy? American babies with a Social Security number, after all, are the most at risk population for identity theft that there is. Sound like a good system?<br><br>Depends who you ask.<br><br>You see, the Government loves stability. Nothing propels a war machine like the stable revenue derived from employees. W2/W4 employees after all, pay the Government first, before they ever receive any money in their pay checks, having it auto-debited from their salaries. Of course, owners do it completely different, having a system designed to support them because well.. "Ownership Supremacy" on planet Earth is easily experienced. Owners pay the Government last, after all expenses have been deducted against revenue.<br><br>A Society of Owners is the only structural equality that will ever be possible. In 2020, the concept of "White Supremacy" dominates the perception of operationally illiterate people. In our country, a socio-economic war was fought, and owners were the winners on both sides of the transition from enslavement to employment, because structure yields results. It was never about black/white... it has always been about the ownership contract. Native Americans did not experience genocide, they experienced the incremental defeat of living on a planet that you do not own. Owners own the world that everyone else is living on.<br><br>Equality begins when you own yourself, and you own root participation in civil Society. That begins at identity formation. American Sovereignty was demonstrated by the founding fathers. They had no permission to dissolve their Sovereign allegiance to the King of England, and they did not have any permission to "Declare Independence" as a Sovereign Nation. But these people understood something far more basic and true. Human authority on planet Earth, and in this Universe, is self-Sovereign, or it does not exist. You may need to fight for your Human Rights, but they will never come from anyone but yourself.<br><br>No Institution, no man-made organization will ever give Humanity the direct experience that the Creator of existence has given to Humanity. Self-Sovereign Human Authority is the only authority that exists in Civil Society, or your Society is not civil.<br><br>Look around 2020 people... your Society is not civil. Fixing that starts with identity, for owners.<br><br>Own Root. It is not optional.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

They’re a really useful construct because they are simple: if you have the token, you can do whatever the token is good for. It’s all the proof that you need: you can present it in exactly the format that you received it in, no cryptography involved.</p><p>This simplicity makes it easy for client developers to get it right, most of the time. You give them a magic value, they put the magic value into the right header, and suddenly the API works and they can stop thinking about this security&nbsp;thing.</p> Sender Constraints <p>The downside to bearer tokens, and it is a big downside, is that anyone who has a copy of the token can use it. TLS protects the token in transit over a direct hop, but it doesn’t fix the fact that the people who are allowed to see the token aren’t the same as the people who are allowed to use the token. This means that if a client sends its token to a rogue resource server, or even the wrong resource server, then that resource server can replay the token somewhere else.</p><p>To address this in the OAuth 2 world, there is active work to define how to do sender constrained access tokens. These tokens would move beyond a bearer token by requiring the client to present some type of verifiable keying material, like a <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8705.html">mutual TLS certificate</a> or an <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-dpop">ephemeral key generated by the client</a>. There was previously work of <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-token-binding">using TLS token binding</a> as well, but that has sadly gone by the wayside as TLS token binding <a href="https://identiverse.com/2018/10/31/chrome-puts-token-binding-in-a-bind/">failed to take off</a>. These work pretty well, but there is an overwhelming prevalence of OAuth 2 code that looks for the Bearer keyword for the token type and breaks if you show it anything else. Because of this, the MTLS spec requires that you continue to use the Bearer token type, and there has even been pushback for DPoP to use Bearer as an option as&nbsp;well.</p><p>And on top of all of this, the token presentation is tangled up with the OAuth2 client authentication, which could be based on a secret, a key, or nothing at all (in the case of public clients).</p><p>With XYZ, we don’t have this legacy of bearer tokens and client authentication, and we were able to build a system that was more consistent from the&nbsp;start.</p> Presenting Keys <p>In XYZ, <a href="https://oauth.xyz/keys/">key presentation is at the core of all client interactions.</a> When a client calls the AS, it identifies itself by its key. The key formats in XYZ are flexible. A client can present its key as a JWK, an X509 certificate, or potentially any number of other formats through extensions. The key can be RSA, or elliptic curve, or potentially some other exotic form. The protocol doesn’t really care, so long as there’s a method to validate&nbsp;it.</p><p>This key can be <a href="https://medium.com/@justinsecurity/xyz-handles-passing-by-reference-and-polymorphic-json-e1af8892f371">passed by value or by reference</a>, and the AS can even decide to assign a reference dynamically, but the important thing is that it’s the key that identifies the software that’s making the call. This alone is an important shift from OAuth 2, because specifications like MTLS for OAuth and DPoP have shown us the value in allowing a client to bind an ephemeral key to its requests. In XYZ, the default is that all client keys are ephemeral, unless the AS has some additional set of metadata and a policy attached to the&nbsp;key.</p><p>Whatever key the client uses for its requests to the AS, it’s reasonable that the client would be able to use that same key for requests to the RS. But in this case, the client is also going to be presenting the access token it was&nbsp;issued.</p><p>But unlike a bearer token, it’s not enough to present the token alone, or the key, or its identifier. The client also has to present proof that it currently holds that key to the server. It does this by performing a cryptographic operation on the request, in some fashion can be verified by the server and associated with the key. But&nbsp;how?</p> Agility of Presentation <p>Herein lies the real trick: a new delegation protocol is going to have to be flexible and agile in how the client is allowed to prove its keys. Just about every deployment is going to have its own considerations and constraints affecting everything from how keys are generated to how proofs can be validated across the&nbsp;layers.</p><p>In XYZ, we’ve made the key presentation modular. Instead of defining a required cryptographic container, XYZ declares that the client has to present the key in a manner bound to its request, in some fashion, and declare that proofing method. The two categories implemented to date are MTLS and HTTP-based message signatures.</p><p>For MTLS, it’s pretty straightforward. The client needs to use its client certificate during the TLS connection to the server, and the server needs to verify that the certificate in use is the same one referenced in the request — either the request body for the AS or the access token for the RS. The server does not need to do a full chain validation of the client’s certificate, though it’s free to do so in order to limit which certificates are presented.</p><p>For HTTP message signing it’s a similar outlay of effort, but the signature is presented at the HTTP layer and has to directly cover some or all of the HTTP request. There are a number of different specifications out there for doing this, and our test XYZ implementations have built out support for a several of them including Cavage signatures, OAuth DPoP, and even a simple JWS-based detached body signature invented for the protocol. The most promising, to my mind, is the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-message-signatures">new signatures specification being worked on in the HTTP working group of the IETF</a>. It’s being based on a long experience with several community specifications, and I think it’s really got a chance to be a unifying security layer across a lot of different applications. Eventually, we’re likely to see library and tooling support like we have with&nbsp;TLS.</p><p>The use cases for these are different. MTLS tends to work great for webserver-based applications, especially in a closed enterprise setup, but it falls apart for SPA’s and ephemeral apps. HTTP message signing is more complex to implement, but it can survive across TLS termination and multiple hops. There is no one answer, and there are likely other approaches that will be invented down the road that work even&nbsp;better.</p> Signatures as a Core&nbsp;Function <p>OAuth 1 had its own bespoke signing mechanism, which confused a lot of developers. OAuth 2 set out to avoid the problems that this caused by removing signatures entirely, but in so doing has pushed the needle too far away from good security practices and made it hard to add such functionality back in. With XYZ we tried to strike the balance by allowing different mechanisms but assuming that signing, of some fashion, was going to be available to every client. With today’s library and software support, this seems to be true across many platforms, and time will tell which methods work the best in the real&nbsp;world.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/38809138">Originally written</a> as a post
<a href="https://www.patreon.com/cwebber">for Patreon donors</a>.)</p>
<p>Hello... just figured I'd give a fairly brief update.  Since I wrote
my last post I've been working hard towards the distributed
programming stuff in Goblins.</p>
<p>In general, this involves implementing a protocol called
<a href="http://wiki.erights.org/wiki/CapTP">CapTP</a>, which
is fairly obscure... the idea is generally to apply the same "object
capability security" concept that Goblins already follows but on a
networked protocol level.  Probably the most prominent other
implementation of CapTP right now is being done by the
<a href="https://agoric.com/">Agoric</a> folks,
<a href="https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/blob/master/packages/captp/lib/captp.js">captp.js</a>.
I've been in communication with them... could we achieve
interoperability between our implementations?  It could be cool, but
it's too early to tell.  Anyway it's one of those technical areas
that's so obscure that I decided to
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/cap-talk/xWv2-J62g-I%5B1-25%5D">document my progress on the cap-talk mailing list</a>,
but that's becoming the length of a small novel... so I guess, beware
before you try to read that whole thing.  I'm far enough along where
the main things work, but not quite everything (CapTP supports such
wild things as distributed garbage collection...!!!!)</p>
<p>Anyway, in general I don't think that people get too excited by
hearing "backend progress is happening"; I believe that implementing
CapTP is even more important than standardizing ActivityPub was in the
long run of my life work, but I also am well aware that in general
people (including myself!) understand best by seeing an interesting
demonstration.  So, I do plan another networked demo, akin to the
<a href="https://dustycloud.org/blog/goblins-time-travel-micropreview/">time-travel Terminal Phase demo</a>,
but I'm not sure just how fancy it will be (yet).  I think I'll have
more things to show on that front in 1-2 months.</p>
<p>(Speaking of Goblins and games, I'm putting together a little library
called <a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/game-goblin">Game Goblin</a>
to make making games on top of Goblins a bit easier; it isn't quite
ready yet but thought I'd mention it.  It's currently going through
some "user testing".)</p>
<p>More work is happening on the Datashards front; Serge Wroclawski
(project leader for Datashards; I guess you could say I'm "technical
engineer") and I have started assembling more documentation and have
put together <a href="https://datashards.net/">some proto-standards documents</a>.
(Warning: WIP WIP WIP!!!)  We are exploring with a standards group
whether or not Datashards would be a good fit there, but it's too
early to talk about that since the standards group is still figuring
it out themselves.  Anyway, it's taken up a good chunk of time so I
figured it was worth mentioning.</p>
<p>So, more to come, and hopefully demos not too far ahead.</p>
<p>But let's end on a fun note.  In-between all that (and various things
at home, of course), I have taken a bit of what might resemble
"downtime" and I'm learning how to make ~chiptunes / "tracker music"
with <a href="https://milkytracker.titandemo.org/">Milkytracker</a>, which is
just a lovely piece of software.  (I've also been learning more about
<a href="http://www.drpetter.se/article_sound.html">sound theory</a> and have
been figuring out how to compose some of my own samples/"instruments"
from code.)  Let me be clear, I'm not very good at it, but it's fun
to learn a new thing.  Here's a <a href="https://dustycloud.org/misc/dollhouse.flac">dollhouse piano thing</a>
(<a href="https://dustycloud.org/misc/dollhouse.xm">XM file</a>), the
<a href="https://dustycloud.org/misc/ecto-house.flac">start of a haunted video game level</a>
(<a href="https://dustycloud.org/misc/conversations-with-a-computer.xm">XM file</a>),
a <a href="https://dustycloud.org/misc/conversations-with-a-computer.flac">sound experiment representing someone interacting with a computer</a>
(<a href="https://dustycloud.org/misc/conversations-with-a-computer.xm">XM file</a>),
and the
<a href="https://dustycloud.org/misc/siddy-start.xm">mandatory demonstration that I've figured out how to do C64-like</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_modulation">phase modulation</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arpeggio">arpeggios</a> (<a href="https://dustycloud.org/misc/siddy-start.xm">XM file</a>).
Is any of that stuff... "good"?  Not really, all pretty amateurish,
but maybe in a few months of off-hour experiments it won't be... so
maybe some of my future demos / games won't be quite as quiet!  ;)</p>
<p>Hope everyone's doing ok out there...</p>

<p>My blog post permalinks have been bothering me for a while, I feel like they are too cluttered. I mostly like the design of my notes and photos permalinks, since the content on those pages is relatively short, I don't mind how much other stuff on the page there is since it's also good for discoverability of my other content. However on my blog posts, people often come to those from some external source, and they're really there just to read the blog post and then leave. So I wanted to clean it up a bit.</p>
<p>Here's what my blog post pages looked like before.</p>

<p>This is on a 13" Macbook screen with a browser as wide as possible. Here is what the blog posts look like now.</p>

<p>I wanted to give the blog posts a bit more space, so I increased the size of the middle column. I also took out the top bar with the clock and weather. I removed my little author avatar (it duplicated my name, and the photo wasn't really placed very well.) I also changed the timestamp to show just the date, instead of the full date and time and timezone. For notes and photos the time is possibly relevant, but it's really not important for blog posts.</p>
<p>I also added a custom font, which tbh I'm on the fence about using. I do feel like the slightly wider font goes well with the slightly larger column.</p>
<p>So that's the first of the projects for the day done!</p>
<p>Update: Thanks to <a href="https://mastodon.social/@sl007/104423151649889418">a suggestion from Sebastian</a>, I also increased the font size on the blog posts to keep a similar number of characters per line.</p>

</h3>

<div class='item-snippet'>
<!-- use 'smarter' algorithm for cutoff snippet text
   note: summary goes first; than try content -->

  I finally made the jump from Travis CI to GitHub Actions for my Postgres extensions. Here’s how you can, too.
   
  
  
  
  
  

</div>
<div class='item-content item-summary'>

<!-- todo: use sanitize or simplify or whitelist
   - todo/fix: check why summary can be nil/null
   note: content goes first; than try summary
 -->
<div class='wrap'>

 
         
<p>I first heard about <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a> a couple years ago, but fully embraced them
only in the last few weeks. Part of the challenge has been the paucity of simple
but realistic examples, and quite a lot of complicated-looking JavaScript-based
actions that seem like overkill. But through trial-and-error, I figured out
enough to update my Postgres extensions projects to automatically test on
multiple versions of Postgres, as well as to bundle and release them on <a href="https://pgxn.org/" title="PGXN: The PostgreSQL Extension Network">PGXN</a>.
The first draft of that effort is <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pgxn/pgxn-tools">pgxn/pgxn-tools</a><a>1</a>, a Docker image
with scripts to build and run any version of PostgreSQL between 8.4 and 12,
install additional dependencies, build, test, bundle, and release an extension.</p>
<p>Here’s how I’ve put it to use in a <a href="https://github.com/theory/pg-semver/blob/c56d76dcbe85e0348b44c6c098560a0df7ab25a5/.github/workflows/ci.yml">GitHub workflow for semver</a>, the
<a href="https://semver.org">Semantic Version</a> data type:</p>
  

 <code> 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
10
11
12
13
14
</code> 

 <code>name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        pg: [12, 11, 10, 9.6, 9.5, 9.4, 9.3, 9.2]
    name: 🐘 PostgreSQL ${{ matrix.pg }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container: pgxn/pgxn-tools
    steps:
      - run: pg-start ${{ matrix.pg }}
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - run: pg-build-test
</code> 
 
 <p>The important bits are in the <code>jobs.test</code> object. Under <code>strategy.matrix</code>, which
defines the build matrix, the <code>pg</code> array defines each version to be tested. The
job will run once for each version, and can be referenced via <code>${{ matrix.pg }}</code>
elsewhere in the job. Line 10 has the job a <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pgxn/pgxn-tools">pgxn/pgxn-tools</a> container, where
the <code>steps</code> run. The are are:</p>
 
 Line 12: Install and start the specified version of PostgreSQL 
 Line 13: Clone the <a href="https://github.com/theory/pg-semver">semver repository</a> 
 Line 14: Build and test the extension 
 
<p>The intent here is to cover the vast majority of cases for testing Postgres
extensions, where a project uses <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/extend-pgxs.html" title="PostgreSQL Extension Building Infrastructure">PGXS</a> <code>Makefile</code>. The <code>pg-build-test</code> script
does just that.</p>
<p>A few notes on the scripts included in <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pgxn/pgxn-tools">pgxn/pgxn-tools</a>:</p>
 
 
<p><code>pg-start</code> installs, initializes, and starts the specified version of Postgres.
If you need other dependencies, simply list their <a href="https://www.debian.org/distrib/packages#search_packages" title="Search Debian Packages">Debian package names</a>
after the Postgres version.</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://github.com/pgxn/pgxnclient"><code>pgxn</code></a> is a client for PGXN itself. You can use it to install other
dependencies required to test your extension.</p>
 
 
<p><code>pg-build-test</code> simply builds, installs, and tests a PostgreSQL extension or
other code in the current directory. Effectively the equivalent of
<code>make &amp;&amp; make install &amp;&amp; make installcheck</code>.</p>
 
 
<p><code>pgxn-bundle</code> validates the <a href="http://manager.pgxn.org/howto" title="PGXN How To">PGXN <code>META.json</code></a> file, reads the distribution
name and version, and bundles up the project into a zip file for release to
PGXN.</p>
 
 
<p><code>pgxn-release</code> uploads a release zip file to <a href="https://pgxn.org/" title="PGXN: The PostgreSQL Extension Network">PGXN</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>In short, use the first three utilities to handle dependencies and test your
extension, and the last two to release it on PGXN. Simply set <a href="https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets">GitHub secrets</a>
with your PGXN credentials, pass them in environment variables named
<code>PGXN_USERNAME</code> and <code>PGXN_PASSWORD</code>, and the script will handle the rest. Here’s
how a release job might look:</p>
  

 <code>15
16
17
18
19
20
21
22
23
24
25
26
27
28
29
30
31
32
</code> 

 <code>  release:
    name: Release on PGXN
    # Release pon push to main when the test job succeeds.
    needs: test
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' &amp;&amp; github.event_name == 'push' &amp;&amp; needs.test.result == 'success'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: pgxn/pgxn-tools
      env:
        PGXN_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.PGXN_USERNAME }}
        PGXN_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.PGXN_PASSWORD }}
    steps:
      - name: Check out the repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Bundle the Release
        run: pgxn-bundle
      - name: Release on PGXN
        run: pgxn-release
</code> 
 
 <p>Note that lines 18-19 require that the <code>test</code> job defined above pass, and ensure
the job runs only on a push event to the <a href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/EasilyRenameYourGitDefaultBranchFromMasterToMain.aspx" title="Easily rename your Git default branch from master to main">main branch</a>, where  we push final
releases. We set <code>PGXN_USERNAME</code> and <code>PGXN_PASSWORD</code> from the secrets of the
same name, and then, in lines 27-32, check out the project, bundle it into a zip
file, and release it on PGXN.</p>
<p>There are a few more features of the image, so <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pgxn/pgxn-tools">read the docs</a>
for the details. As a first cut at PGXN <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD" title="Wikipedia: “CI/CD”">CI/CD</a> tools, I think it’s fairly
robust. Still, as I gain experience and build and release more extensions in the
coming year, I expect to work out integration with publishing <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-releases-in-a-repository">GitHub releases</a>,
and perhaps build and publish relevant actions on the <a href="https://github.com/marketplace">GitHub Marketplace</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Not a great name, I know, will probably change as I learn more. <a>↩︎</a></p>

It could also be used with native applications, but <a href="https://developers.google.com/gdata/docs/auth/overview#identifying-your-application-to-users">it was awkward at best</a> due to many of the assumptions built into the OAuth 1 model. To be fair, smartphones didn’t really exist yet, and the handful of clunky desktop apps could more or less be dealt with via a few hacks. In OAuth 2, we at least admitted that mobile applications were now A Thing and created the notion of a public client with no recognizable credentials of its own. But it turned out that wasn’t enough, and we needed <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636">additional tools</a> and <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8252">additional guidance for developers</a> to get mobile applications right. Even later, <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-browser-based-apps">single-page applications</a> really came into their own, further defying previous assumptions about OAuth clients. Smart devices and the internet of things drove a world of <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628">new interaction methods</a> and even <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-client-initiated-backchannel-authentication-core-1_0.html">new ideas about what logging in means</a>. And all of this is on top of OAuth’s core set of grant types, the differences between which are largely driven by the abilities of different clients.</p><p>This kind of flexibility and adaptability is one of OAuth 2’s greatest successes, so what’s the problem? Simply put, OAuth 2 makes a lot of assumptions that the user has access to a web browser which is on the same device as the client. In today’s world of smart clients, rich applications, and constrained devices, these assumptions no longer match reality and there’s a real need for a system with more flexibility. While browsers are certainly still around, we aren’t just connecting two websites to each other anymore, and our security protocols should reflect&nbsp;that.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@rmrdnl?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Daniel Romero</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a> Getting the User&nbsp;Involved <p>In OAuth 2, the type of interaction that the client is capable of is defined by the authorization grant that’s in use. This dictates, among other things, how the user gets to the AS and how they get back from the AS to the client. In the authorization code grant, which is at the core of the OAuth 2 protocol design, the user is redirected in both directions through HTTP. The client has to choose exactly one way of dealing with the user before it starts, and this leads to awkward situations like the Device Grant letting the user interactively enter a code at a static URL or having a pre-composed URL that the user just follows. It also means that different grant types need to re-invent parts of the process used in other grant types just so that they can do things a little differently.</p><p>But what if we could decompose all of these aspects and get away from a type-based system? In XYZ, instead of choosing a grant type, a client declares all of the different parts of interaction that it supports. The AS then responds with appropriate responses to whatever portions it supports for that request. From there, the client can take action based on whatever portions make sense. After all, the client knows how it can interact with the user. With these tools, <a href="https://oauth.xyz/interaction/">XYZ’s interaction model allows for a very rich set of interactions</a>.</p><p>In XYZ, we wanted to enable the traditional redirect-based interaction but not depend on it. To do that, the client tells the AS that it can handle redirecting the user to an arbitrary URL, and also signals that it can get the user back on a similar redirect. With this, we’ve got everything we need for an authorization code style interaction.</p> {<br>    "interact": {<br>        "redirect": true,<br>        "callback": {<br>            "uri": "https://client.foo",<br>            "nonce": "VJLO6A4CAYLBXHTR0KRO"<br>        }<br>    }<br>} <p>OK, but what if we’re now talking about a set-top box that can’t pop open a browser? Here we take a clue from the OAuth 2 device grant and say that we could display an arbitrary code, but at a static URL. We expect the user to go there on a secondary device, and so we don’t have a good way to get the user back at the client&nbsp;itself.</p> {<br>    "interact": {<br>        "user_code": true<br>    }<br>} <p>This is great, but what if we could handle either a redirect or a user code? Let’s say, for instance, that we can hand the user a code they can type in, or we can get them to scan a barcode on a secondary device and be sent to an arbitrary page. To handle that, we simply say we can do&nbsp;both.</p> {<br>    "interact": {<br>        "redirect": true,<br>        "user_code": true<br>    }<br>} <p>Notice that our client expects the user to complete the request on a separate device, and so we don’t have the callback parameter included. The AS can decide whether that’s good enough for what’s being asked, or not. An important difference between these protocols is that OAuth 2 starts with a redirect, while XYZ allows the redirect only after the initial back-channel request. This means we can mix things together in novel ways. For example, we could say that we expect the user to enter a code at a fixed URL, but we do want the user to come back to a callback webpage so that our client can continue.</p> {<br>    "interact": {<br>        "redirect": true,<br>        "callback": {<br>            "uri": "https://client.foo",<br>            "nonce": "VJLO6A4CAYLBXHTR0KRO"<br>        }<br>    }<br>} <p>What kind of client would ever need to do this? Maybe we’ve got a smart client on device that has ties to a push notification service with a web-based component, or there’s some other deployment structure that we haven’t thought up yet. Componentizing how the user gets to the AS separately from how the user gets back allows us to mix, match, and stack capabilities as appropriate for our use&nbsp;case.</p><p>This setup means we can start to think about other ways to get the user back and securing that return, as well. We need to consider capabilities like sending a response to the client application directly through an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2_Server_Push">HTTP/2 Server Push</a>, or a client being notified through some other signaling mechanism.</p> Moving Off the&nbsp;Web <p>Even more importantly, we need to consider interactions with the user outside of the web entirely. While XYZ’s back channel is defined completely over HTTP calls, it doesn’t have to use the front channel (redirects) to interact with the user at all. Here is where the capability-based interaction mechanism starts to get really powerful.</p><p>What if the client indicates that it can do a webauthn style signature? The server can offer its challenge to be signed in the initial response, and the client can sign it (by prompting the user to activate their key) and return the results in the follow-up request. If it’s a key the AS already knows, and there isn’t any consent to be gathered, the user doesn’t need to be redirected anywhere.</p><p>Or what if the client has access to a digital agent with ties to a non-web distributed data store, like a blockchain or other graph-based data fabric? The client can indicate that it can send and receive messages to this agent, or field queries through it. The agent and the AS might be part of the same data fabric, and therefore not need to go through the client in order to communicate. Such a system could even gather and manage consent entirely outside of a web-based protocol. All the XYZ client would need to care about is how to kick off the transaction and how to get the&nbsp;results.</p><p>Or what if the client wants to prompt the user directly for their credentials (cringe)? It’s generally considered bad security practice, but the UX of a login experience that stays completely native to the application is compelling, even today. Be defining an interaction mode specifically for this, the AS can help manage things in a more secure fashion than the OAuth 2 Resource Owner Password Grant. It could allow some kind of clever presentation of the shared secret without exposing it directly, and it could even account for different kinds of&nbsp;MFA.</p><p>Or what if the AS can interact with the user through a native application? The client should be able to indicate it can support that without pretending it’s an HTTP redirect.</p><p>And if a client could do many different things, then it can set them up in the initial request and let the AS decide what is allowed according to its own policies. We should be able to prompt for a security token and call an on-device agent and redirect out to a webpage if that’s not enough. Since the client doesn’t need to pick a single method ahead of time, it doesn’t even need to discover what is possible in order for it to work. This type of engineering at the protocol level greatly enhances interoperability while simplifying code paths for both client and&nbsp;server.</p><p>And finally, what if we don’t need to interact most of the time? OAuth 2 forces the client to try interaction first, but if the AS knows who the client is and who the user is, then it could decide to grant access without ever doing an explicit interaction. We can even do a bootstrapping of complex protocols, such as allowing the client to present an assertion to represent the user but still allowing the AS to interact through a web page (or some other mechanism) if necessary. The user gets involved only when they need&nbsp;to.</p><p>Interaction is one of the core extensibility points of XYZ and one of the key places where it breaks from OAuth 2’s past assumptions. The possibilities are nearly endless, and I believe we’re going to see some really exciting advancements in this&nbsp;space.</p>

One of the first and most important decisions I made was to not be backwards compatible with OAuth&nbsp;2.</p><p>This is a bold choice: OAuth 2 is absolutely everywhere, and deliberately breaking with it will put any new protocol at a distinct deployment disadvantage. However, I think that the advantages in the flexibility, especially in the models, are worth it. There are a ton of use cases that don’t fit well into the OAuth 2 world, and even though many of these square pegs have been crammed into the round hole, we can do better than that by taking a step back and designing something new.</p> Working With the&nbsp;Legacy <p>For people in these new use cases, this is a great opportunity. But what about everyone out there who already has OAuth 2 systems and wants to also support something new? XYZ doesn’t exist in a vacuum, and so as a solution it needs to take OAuth 2 developers into account in its design even while addressing the new&nbsp;world.</p><p>To do that, we’ve taken a page from how some of the most successful backwards compatible efforts in the past have worked. Let’s look at Ninendo’s Wii console. When it was introduced, one of its most compelling features was a radically new control scheme. This had features like wireless connections, IR-based pointers, switchable accessories, motion sensitivity, and even a built-in speaker. It was unlike anything else out there, and it was a particularly radical departure from Nintendo’s previous generation game console, the GameCube. Nintendo wanted to encourage existing GameCube owners to come along to the new system, not just by making the new features compelling on their own right (since without that, why move away from the GameCube?) but also by adding ports to allow GameCube games and hardware to be used with the new system. If you had GameCube stuff, there was a place you could plug it in. It was on the side/top of the console and hidden under a flap, but it’s there if you wanted to use&nbsp;it.</p>The ports are there, just hidden. Image from <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Gamecube-Games-on-Wii">https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Gamecube-Games-on-Wii</a><p>Now if you wanted to play a Wii game, you needed to use the Wii controllers and hardware. And if you wanted to play a GameCube game, you could always just buy a GameCube. But what if you were interested in doing both, but didn’t want to have two systems sitting under your TV? This model of focusing on the new but allowing the old to be plugged in is a powerful one, and it was wildly successful.</p> Plugging OAuth 2 Into&nbsp;XYZ <p>XYZ’s core model is pretty different from OAuth 2. XYZ doesn’t have client IDs as part of the protocol, nor does it have scopes. Instead, clients are identified by their keys, and resources have a rich request language to describe them in multiple dimensions. You can even request multiple access tokens simultaneously. All of these are great for use cases like ephemeral and native clients, or rich APIs, but what about something where OAuth 2 already works&nbsp;ok?</p><p>Just like with the Wii, we’ve made sure that there’s a place to plug in things. In fact, this is one of the <a href="https://medium.com/@justinsecurity/xyz-handles-passing-by-reference-and-polymorphic-json-e1af8892f371">key features that polymorphic JSON brings to the party</a>. Let’s say you’ve got an OAuth 2 client that has been assigned the client ID client1 and it asks for scopes foo and bar at its AS. This is pretty easy for a developer to plug in to the authorization endpoint (ignoring other optional parameters):</p> client_id=client1&amp;scope=foo%20bar <p>Since we don’t have explicit client identifiers or scopes in XYZ, what are we supposed to do with these values? To understand that, we first need to take a step back and think about what these items each mean in the context of the overall protocol.</p><p>The client_id in OAuth 2 identifies the client, which should be no surprise. But why do we need to identify the client? For one, we want to make sure that when the client authenticates, it does so using the appropriate set of credentials. Since the browser is untrusted for handling shared secrets, we can’t pass those credentials in the front channel where OAuth 2 starts and we need a separate identifier. If we start in the back channel, we don’t need an identifier separate from the credential. But more fundamentally, what does it mean to identify the client at all? The AS is going to want to know which client is asking so that it can apply the appropriate policies, including gathering consent from the user, and these policies drive the rest of the decision process. We can make that same set of decisions without a separate identifier and using the credential directly. XYZ allows us to send the credential by value, but it also allows us to send a reference to that credential instead of the value. In this way, we can use our existing client_id to tell the AS which key we’re using to protect the requests by passing it in as the key handle for the request, in lieu of the key itself. The AS can associate the key, and therefore the policies, by looking up the&nbsp;handle.</p><p>The scope of OAuth 2 follows a similar journey. A resource in XYZ is described by a multi-dimensional and potentially complex object, with actions, locations, datatypes, and any number of API-specific components to it. But just like the client_id, we need to ask ourselves what does the scope represent in OAuth 2? Functionally, it’s a shortcut asking for a particular slice of an API, defined by the API. So in other words, it’s a predefined combination of actions, locations, datatypes, and any number of other API-specific components — it is a shorthand to a concept analogous to one of the resource request objects in XYZ. Which means, of course, that we can use a resource handle to represent that predefined object.</p><p>What this means is that our client developer has a place in the protocol to plug in the values that they already have. They don’t plug into the same place, and they don’t go through quite the same circuitry, but they’re there, and they&nbsp;work.</p> {<br>    "keys": "client1",<br>    "resources": [<br>        "foo",<br>        "bar"<br>    ]<br>} <p>But here’s something really cool about this: once we’re plugging in our values into the new protocol, then we can start to use the new features alongside the old ones. Since we have the new system, we can play both the new games as well as the old games. That means that our client could, for example, ask for an additional detailed resource alongside its tried and true&nbsp;scopes.</p> {<br>    "keys": "client1",<br>    "resources": [<br>        "foo",<br>        "bar",<br>        {<br>             "actions": ["read", "write"],<br>             "datatypes": ["accounts", "history"]<br>        }<br>} <p>All of this is done without putting a burden on new apps to use any of these legacy mechanisms. Ephemeral apps don’t have to pretend to get a client ID, and resource servers don’t have to wrap their APIs into simple scope values. Those functions are there for the cases where they make sense and stay out of the way when they&nbsp;don’t.</p> Staying With OAuth&nbsp;2 <p>But what if you don’t want all the new features at all? What if you’re totally fine with OAuth 2 as it is today, or as it will be in a year with all of its extensions? In those cases, just keep using it. No, really. If it’s a good solution, you should keep using it, even if something fancier is on the horizon. OAuth 2 is a good solution for a lot of things, and we’ll continue seeing it for a long time to&nbsp;come.</p><p>OAuth 2’s got a lot of great extensions that let it do a lot of different things, including things like PAR and RAR that start to approach a very different protocol that’s closer to XYZ than classical OAuth 2. However, these extensions have to live in the world of OAuth 2, and the fit isn’t always that great. But for many developers, the cost of smushing these new functionalities in to their existing system might be less than the cost of switching to a new system, and that’s a fine and reasonable approach.</p><p>But for the rest of the world, those who aren’t using OAuth 2 because it’s not a good fit or want OAuth 2 but a bit more than what it offers, then it’s a good time to move forward in a clear and deliberate way.</p>

 Monitoring WSO2 Identity Server Health with Prometheus/Grafana <p>Monitoring the health of your application is something we must have in a production system to make sure that the application is running without any issues. In addition, monitoring may be required in performance testing, capacity planning, etc as well in the pre-production environments to see who well the application perform under different conditions.</p><p>WSO2 Identity Server is an IAM server which is running on a JVM. There are multiple ways where you can monitor the health of a JVM application which can be used with Identity Server as well. In this post, we’ll see how to do that with Prometheus and&nbsp;Grafana.</p> Adding the Prometheus JMX&nbsp;exporter <p>Prometheus is a pull-based monitoring application. It provides different tools and clients to extract the data out of different applications. One such tool is the <a href="https://github.com/prometheus/jmx_exporter">JMX exporter</a>. Let’s see how we can add this exporter to Identity Server so that It can make the Identity Server JVM matrices available to Prometheus.</p><p>First, create a config file to be used by the JMX exporter at &lt;IS_HOME&gt;/bin as is.yml and add the following in that&nbsp;file.</p> lowercaseOutputLabelNames: true<br>lowercaseOutputName: true<br>whitelistObjectNames: ["java.lang:type=OperatingSystem"]<br>blacklistObjectNames: []<br>rules:<br>  - pattern: 'java.lang&lt;type=OperatingSystem&gt;&lt;&gt;(committed_virtual_memory|free_physical_memory|free_swap_space|total_physical_memory|total_swap_space)_size:'<br>    name: os_$1_bytes<br>    type: GAUGE<br>    attrNameSnakeCase: true<br>  - pattern: 'java.lang&lt;type=OperatingSystem&gt;&lt;&gt;((?!process_cpu_time)\w+):'<br>    name: os_$1<br>    type: GAUGE<br>    attrNameSnakeCase: true <p>Then get the latest release version Prometheus JMX exporter from <a href="https://github.com/prometheus/jmx_exporter/releases">here</a>. You may also need to build it to get the binary. Place that binary in the &lt;IS_HOME&gt;/bin/.</p><p>Now, open the &lt;IS_HOME&gt;/bin/wso2server.sh file (or the&nbsp;.bat file for windows), and scroll to the bottom of the file and add the following as a parameter,</p> -javaagent:$CARBON_HOME/bin/jmx_prometheus_javaagent-0.13.0.jar=8880:$CARBON_HOME/bin/is.yml \ <p>Note that I’m using the 0.13.0 version of the agent here which I took at the previous step. If it is different please update accordingly.</p><p>Also, note that I’m using 8880 port to export the metrics. You may change this port also if required.</p><p>The &lt;IS_HOME&gt;/bin/wso2server.sh file should look like below with the other parameters</p>     ....<br>    -Dhttpclient.hostnameVerifier="DefaultAndLocalhost" \<br>    -Dorg.apache.xml.security.ignoreLineBreaks=false \<br>    -javaagent:$CARBON_HOME/bin/jmx_prometheus_javaagent-0.13.0.jar=8880:$CARBON_HOME/bin/is.yml \<br>    org.wso2.carbon.bootstrap.Bootstrap $*<br>    .... <p>Start the Identity&nbsp;Server.</p><p>You can verify the exporter is properly configured by accessing <a href="http://localhost:8880/metrics">http://localhost:8880/metrics</a> (Use the same port you configured in the&nbsp;.sh&nbsp;file)</p> Configuring Prometheus to Pull&nbsp;Data <p>Now at Prometheus, we need to pull the data from Identity Server. To do that create a file named is.yml at PROMETHEUS_HOME. And add the following configs&nbsp;there,</p> global:<br>  scrape_interval:     15s <br>  evaluation_interval: 15s   # Alertmanager configuration<br>alerting:<br>  alertmanagers:<br>  - static_configs:<br>    - targets:<br>      # - alertmanager:9093  # Load rules once and periodically evaluate them according to the global 'evaluation_interval'.<br>rule_files:  # A scrape configuration containing exactly one endpoint to scrape:<br>scrape_configs:<br>  - job_name: 'WSO2 Identity Server'  static_configs:<br>    - targets: ['localhost:8880'] <p>Note that as targets we gave the hostname and port of the endpoint where Identity Server was exporting the metrics. By default, the context path will be assumed as /metrics. So we won’t need to explicitly configure it&nbsp;here.</p><p>Now start the Prometheus server&nbsp;as</p> ./prometheus --config.file=is.yml <p>The Prometheus server will start at <a href="http://localhost:9090/">http://localhost:9090/</a></p><p>Go to Status -&gt; Targets from the main menu, and see If the Identity Server is properly configured. You should see something as below if all are&nbsp;correct.</p><p>At Prometheus, we can run different queries and see some basic graphs. But I’ll skip that as we can get a lot better graphs with&nbsp;Grafana.</p> Configuring Grafana <p>Download and extract Grafana, and start it by running&nbsp;./grafana-server from GRAFANA_HOME/bin.</p><p>Grafana will start on <a href="http://localhost:3000/">http://localhost:3000/</a>. Use the default credentials (admin:admin) to log in (and make sure you change them&nbsp;later)</p><p>At Grafana, first we need to add Prometheus as a datasource for Grafana. To do that, go to Configuration -&gt; Data Sources from the left navigation as&nbsp;below.</p><p>Click add and select ‘Prometheus’ as the type of the data source and provide the connection details as&nbsp;below,</p><p>Now we need to create dashboards from the data we retrieve from Prometheus. Well, we don’t need to create them from scratch. Instead, we can reuse an already available dashboard by importing it. There are few dashboards already available for JVM metrics. Out of them, I prefer the one at <a href="https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/8563">https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/8563</a>. So, Let’s use it&nbsp;here.</p><p>In Grafana, hover over the ‘+’ icon on the left menu and click ‘Import’. And under ‘Import via grafana.com’ give the Id of the above mentioned dashboard which is 8563 and click&nbsp;‘load’.</p><p>On the next page give the ‘Job’ as ‘WSO2 Identity Server’ (which is the job name we gave at Prometheus), and click&nbsp;Import.</p><p>Now you’ll see a nice dashboard with all the health data from the Identity Server. It will&nbsp;include,</p>  Server status (Up/Down)  Uptime  CPU usage  Memory Usage  GC details  Threads  Classloading  <p>Following are some screenshots from my local server (which was mostly idling&nbsp;:))</p>Server status/uptime/CPU UsageMemory usage/GC&nbsp;timeThreads/ Classloading/Physical Memory<p>That’s it! Happy monitoring!</p><p>PS. I was also interested in getting the Identity data also here (like Login details, User signups, etc). And I made some good progress with that. I will cover those in a separate blog&nbsp;post.</p><p>References:</p><p><a href="https://madurangasblogs.blogspot.com/2019/02/monitoring-wso2-identity-server-with.html">https://madurangasblogs.blogspot.com/2019/02/monitoring-wso2-identity-server-with.html</a></p>

  There are many reasons to delete your Facebook account, so let's start with the assumption you've already made the decision. Here are a few things to know before you press the big "Delete" button.

<p>There are <a href="https://indieweb.org/Facebook#Criticism">many reasons</a> to delete your Facebook account, so let's start with the assumption you've already made the decision. Here are a few things to know before you press the big "Delete" button.</p>
<p>Actually deleting your account can have some unintended consequences, so I actually recommend a slightly different approach instead. The problem with deleting your account is that you will essentially disappear from Facebook and any of your friends there won't be able to find you when they do things like tag you in a photo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember, even if you delete your account, that isn't going to stop other people from trying to search for you or tag you in posts.</p>
<p>Where this starts to become a problem is it opens up the opportunity for hackers to create a new Facebook account with your name, and start to befriend people in your network, impersonating you and infiltrating your friend network. You might think this would only be a problem for famous people, but believe it or not it can happen to anyone. (If you do see an account that is impersonating someone, you can <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/174210519303259?helpref=uf_permalink">report it here</a>.)</p>
<p>Another problem is trying to track down every website where you've used "Sign in with Facebook" and remember to add another login method. Keeping your Facebook account around just to be able to sign in to things you've forgotten about later isn't a bad idea.</p>
<p>So instead of deleting your account entirely, a better approach is to remove everything from your profile except for a post that tells people where they can actually follow you elsewhere online.</p>
<p>Let's get started.</p>
 Download Your Information 
<p>You'll probably want to download all your data before deleting everything, either for posterity, or so that you can import the posts into your own website later as well.</p>
<p>Facebook provides an export that contains a reasonably high fidelity version of everything you've done on Facebook. You can find the link to download by going to "Settings", "Your Facebook Information" and clicking "Download Your Information", or by visiting this link:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/dyi/">https://www.facebook.com/dyi/</a></p>

  

<p>It will take a while before the download link is available, possibly days, so you may need to come back to the rest of this process later.</p>
<p>The HTML export is a fully browsable archive of everything in your account. If you want something you can use to <a href="https://indieweb.org/Facebook#How_to_migrate_off_of">import your posts into your website</a> later then you can download the JSON version instead.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alright, with that out of the way we can start getting into the good stuff.</p>
 Clean Up Your Facebook Groups 
<p>Groups are one of the few reasons to use Facebook at all, since groups can be made private, it's a reasonable way to have a hidden place to share things with specific people. There also aren't a lot of good alternatives right now.</p>
<p>So you'll want to either remove yourself from all the groups you're in, or at the very least turn off all notifications so that you aren't reminded about them constantly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From a group's page, click the three dots and choose "manage notifications".</p>

  

<p>Turn notifications "off", and also disable member request notifications.</p>

  

<p>I say "off" in quotes because apparently this will still notify you if you are mentioned in a group. Good enough.</p>
<p>You can also "unfollow" the group which will stop pushing updates from it into your timeline, but you'll still remain a member.</p>
<p>Go ahead and go through your list of groups and clean those up.</p>
 Facebook Pages 
<p>If you've created any Facebook Pages in the past, you'll want to decide what happens to them. You can delete pages entirely, or hand them over to other admins.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can find the list of pages you maintain here:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages">https://www.facebook.com/pages</a></p>
<p>From a page, click "Page Settings" and then find the "Page Roles" option in the sidebar. If there are other admins, you can remove yourself.</p>

  

 Update your Timeline Settings 
<p>Next you'll want to make sure nobody can post stuff on your profile. From your profile page, find the "timeline settings" option. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=timeline&amp;privacy_source=timeline_gear_menu">This link</a> might take you there directly.</p>
<p>Update your Timeline and Tagging Settings to look like the below screenshot.</p>

  

<p>This will prevent anyone from being able to post stuff to your profile without your knowledge, to make sure that only your final "find me elsewhere" post will be visible.</p>
<p>You'll also want to update your <a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=privacy">privacy settings</a> to the below.</p>

  

<p>This locks down everything as much as possible so that people won't be prompted to friend you by correlating your contact info.</p>
<p>Under the "<a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=facerec">Face Recognition</a>" setting, prevent Facebook from recognizing you in photos by disabling this.</p>

  

<p>Under the section called "<a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=followers&amp;view">Public Posts</a>", you'll want to make a few changes. This is one of the few places where you actually do want one of the settings opened up.</p>

  

<p>I've turned the bottom three settings to the most restricted option, but "Who Can Follow Me" is set to "Public". That's so that people who don't know you will see your last "find me elsewhere" post when looking up your profile.</p>
 Start Deleting Stuff 
<p>With these settings out of the way, we can move on to the step of actually deleting old posts. The overall goal here is to make sure people know this is you while also directing them to find your content elsewhere. That means you want to avoid giving people a reason to follow your Facebook account, and deleting your old posts is a good way to demonstrate that you aren't using Facebook anymore.</p>
<p>Start by visiting your profile page and choose "Activity Log". This will bring up a very long list of everything you've done on Facebook. Click "Filter" and choose "Posts". That will show only the things you've posted rather than posts you're tagged in.&nbsp;</p>

  

<p>Now you can go through and remove your old posts.</p>

  

<p>Depending on how thorough you want to be, you can do the same to remove your likes or comments as well. You'll probably want to go through the list of photos as well as photos you're tagged in. You don't necessarily need to untag yourself from everything though, because one of the settings previously mentioned makes it so other people can't see things you're tagged in from your profile page.</p>
<p>If you get bored deleting things, then there's another option to sort of do this in bulk. There's an option to "limit past posts" to be visible to only your friends. While this isn't quite the same as deleting, it at least means people who are searching for you won't be able to see your old posts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can find that option under Settings -&gt; <a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=privacy">Privacy</a>.&nbsp;</p>

  


  

<p>If you've previously set up a tool that imports posts into Facebook such as IFTTT, then you can actually bulk-delete posts that were created by that app.</p>
<p>Go to the "<a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=applications">Apps and Websites</a>" section in Settings and find the app such as IFTTT. From there, you can click "View and Edit", and then click the "Remove" button and you'll see a prompt asking if you want to delete things that app has posted.</p>

  

<p>That should do a pretty good job of mass-deleting things. Although in my testing, it missed a few posts, and some of the apps I know I used to post things weren't showing up in the list. Still, this saved me a bunch of time deleting the things it did catch.</p>
<p>You might want to double check that things aren't still showing up on your profile page by visiting your page and looking through the different sections. For example in my testing, there were still some uploaded photos showing up on my photos tab that weren't showing up in the activity log.</p>
<p>Another place to look for more things that may have been missed is the "Albums" section under photos.</p>
 Trim Your Profile Page 
<p>The next step is to limit what shows up on your profile page. Visit your profile, then click the "More" button and choose "Manage Sections".</p>

  

<p>Disable everything that you can. Some of them can't be turned off.</p>

  

<p>You'll probably want to review the list of people and pages you're following to make sure you want to continue to essentially endorse them from your profile. I decided to unfollow everyone who wasn't a mutual friend.</p>
 Clean Up Your Profile Info 
<p>I was surprised just how much stuff was in my profile. Each of these sections under the "About" tab has content that you should review and decide whether to keep on your profile.</p>

  

<p>This is where it's a bit of a balancing act between how much data you want to delete from Facebook vs whether you want people to be able to verify that this is in fact your profile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I decided to remove all the "family" connections to avoid feeding their graph database but also since most people finding my Facebook page really do not need to know who I am related to.</p>
<p>I removed everything from the "Life Events" section like my work history. If someone wants to know that they can find my LinkedIn.</p>
<p>Under Contact Info I added a link to my website and my Twitter account, since those are the two primary places I want to send people to instead of Facebook.</p>

  

 Make a Final "Find Me Elsewhere" Post 
<p>The last thing to do is write a new post that will be the last thing you post to Facebook. That post should tell people that you won't be posting here anymore, and direct them to one or more alternative ways to contact you. Think about why someone would land on your Facebook page and make a call to action to redirect them to a better location.</p>
<p>I like using the "Life Event" feature on Facebook for this post. It makes it a very large post and really drives the point home. Plus you can use this cute animation of someone shining a flashlight around as the image.</p>

  

 Check Your Work 
<p>Once you're happy with how things are looking, it's time to see what your Facebook page look like to other people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Facebook has a built-in feature to view the public version of your profile. Click the little eye in the menu bar on your profile page. That will show you what someone who is not a friend will see when they visit your profile.&nbsp;</p>

  

<p>Now you can poke around your profile and make sure it looks the way you want!&nbsp;</p>
<p>It might also be helpful to ask a friend to see what your profile looks like to them, since some of your old posts may have been set to "friends-only" and wouldn't show up in the public view.</p>
<p>Congrats! Now enjoy a Facebook-free life!</p>
<p>If you feel so inclined, add a link to this post in a comment under your "I'm leaving" post so that others can follow this advice too!</p>

  <p>Summary:      We need to replace platforms that intermediate transactions with protocols built on a universal trust framework like Sovrin to avoid a future of hostage taking and retaliatory regulations.</p>


<a></a>

<p>
    Platforms service <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/two-sidedmarket.asp">two-sided markets</a>. We're all familiar with platform companies like Uber, AirBnB, Monster, eBay, and many others. Visa, Mastercard, and other credit card systems are platforms. Platforms are a popular Web 2.0 business model because they create an attractive way for the provider to extract service fees from one side, and sometimes both sides, of the market. They can have big network effects and tend to natural monopolies. 
</p>

<p>
    Platforms provide several things that make them valuable to users:
</p>
 
     They provide a means of discovering relevant service providers. 
     They facilitate the transaction. 
     They help participants make the leap over the trust gap, as <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/rachel_botsman_we_ve_stopped_trusting_institutions_and_started_trusting_strangers">Rachel Botsman</a> puts it.  
 

<p>
    Like compound interest, small advantages in any of these roles can have huge effects over time as network effects exploit the advantage to drive participants to a particular platform. This is happening rapidly during the recent crisis in food delivery platforms.
</p>

<p>
    A recent New York Times article, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/technology/delivery-apps-restaurants-fees-virus.html">As Diners Flock to Delivery Apps, Restaurants Fear for Their Future</a>, highlights the power that platforms have over their users:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>But once the lockdowns began, the apps became essentially the only source of business for the barroom restaurant he ran with a partner, Charlie Greene, in Columbus, Ohio. That was when the fees to the delivery companies turned into the restaurant’s single largest cost—more than what it paid for food or labor.</p>

    <p>Pierogi Mountain’s primary delivery company, Grubhub, took more than 40 percent from the average order, Mr. Majesky’s Grubhub statements show. That flipped his restaurant from almost breaking even to plunging deeply into the red. In late April, Pierogi Mountain shut down.</p>

    <p>"You have no choice but to sign up, but there is no negotiating," Mr. Majesky, who has applied for unemployment, said of the delivery apps. "It almost turns into a hostage situation."</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
    The standard response to these problems from people is more regulation. The article discusses some of the attempts cities, counties, and states have made to rein in the fees that food delivery platforms are charging. 
</p>

<p>
    A better response is to create systems that don't require an intermediary. Sovrin provides an <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/08/life-like_identity_why_the_internet_needs_an_identity_metasystem.shtml">identity metasystem</a> that provides a <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2017/01/a_universal_trust_framework.shtml">univeral trust framework</a> for <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/02/building_identity_systems_on_the__sovrin_network.shtml">building identity systems</a> that can serve as the foundation for creating markets without intermediaries. When Sovrin has a token it can even facilitate the transaction. 
</p>

<p>
    Defining a marketplace requires determining the protocol for interaction between participants and creating the means of discovery. The protocol might be simple or complex depending on the market and could be built on top of DIDComm, or even ride on top of a verifiable credential exchange. There might be businesses that provide discovery, but they don't intermediate, they sit to the side of the interaction providing a service. For example, I might provide a service that allows a restaurant to define it's menu, create a shopping cart, and provide for discovery, but I'm easily <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2014/03/substitutability_is_an_indispensable_property_for_the_internet_of_things.shtml">replacable by another provider</a> because the trust interaction and transaction are happening via a protocol built on a universal metasystem. 
</p>

<p>
    Building markets without intermediaries greatly reduces the cost of participating in the market and frees participants to innovate. And it does it without introducing regulation that stifles innovation and locks in incumbents by making it difficult for new entrants to comply. I'm hopeful that Sovrin and related technology will put an end to the platform era of the Internet by supporting greater, <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/10/fidelity_provenance_and_trust.shtml">trustworthy</a> <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/07/its_the_autonomy_stupid.shtml">autonomy for all participants</a>.

  <p>Summary:      Once you know the kind of bike and the price range, only one thing matters: do you love riding it?</p>


<a></a>
<p>
    My middle son Jacob recently asked me about a number of gravel bikes in the $1000-1500 price range. In looking them over, they all had aluminum frames, carbon forks, and mechanical disk brakes. The other components differed a little from bike to bike but nothing stood out. All were from major manufacturers. 
</p>

<p>
    How to choose? I've bought a number of bikes over the years (I've only got three right now). I told Jacob that one thing made all the difference in choosing: the test ride. I've often been taken in by the specs on a bike, only to ride it and find that it felt dead. The bikes I've purchased spoke to me. They felt like they were alive, a part of me, and I wanted to ride them. Bottom line: buy the bike you fall in love with. 
</p>

<p>
    The implication of this is to buy from a local shop since you need to test ride and they have the bikes. Establishing a relationship with the shop is useful for service and advice too. They often will discount service on bikes they sold. Most bike shops have knowledgeable staff and can help you with everything from accessories to good riding trails. You might pay a bit more, but I think it's worth it.

Namely, what’s with all the handles everywhere?</p> What is a&nbsp;Handle? <p>The XYZ protocol works by passing JSON objects around that represent different parts of the request and response. These parts include the keys the client is using to protect the request, the resources the client is asking for, the user information the client wants or knows about, the display information to be used in an interaction, and other stuff. Handles are, in short, a way to pass some of the request objects in as a reference value instead of as an&nbsp;object.</p><p>First a quick aside: why the name “handle” for this bit? In all honesty, it was the best I could come up with that wasn’t already massively overloaded within the space. Artifact, token, aspect, reference, etc&nbsp;… all arguably better than handle but they could be confusing. I hope that the final version of this protocol can bikeshed a better name for this concept, but for now they’re&nbsp;handles.</p><p>Let’s take keys for an example. In XYZ, the client identifies itself using its key. It can always pass its public key by&nbsp;value:</p> {<br>    "keys": {<br>        "proof": "jwsd",<br>        "jwks": {<br>            "keys": [<br>                {<br>                    "kty": "RSA",<br>                    "e": "AQAB",<br>                    "kid": "xyz-1",<br>                    "alg": "RS256",<br>                    "n": "kOB5rR4Jv0GMeLaY6_It_r3ORwdf8ci_JtffXyaSx8xYJCCNaOKNJn_Oz0YhdHbXTeWO5AoyspDWJbN5w_7bdWDxgpD-y6jnD1u9YhBOCWObNPFvpkTM8LC7SdXGRKx2k8Me2r_GssYlyRpqvpBlY5-ejCywKRBfctRcnhTTGNztbbDBUyDSWmFMVCHe5mXT4cL0BwrZC6S-uu-LAx06aKwQOPwYOGOslK8WPm1yGdkaA1uF_FpS6LS63WYPHi_Ap2B7_8Wbw4ttzbMS_doJvuDagW8A1Ip3fXFAHtRAcKw7rdI4_Xln66hJxFekpdfWdiPQddQ6Y1cK2U3obvUg7w"<br>                }<br>            ]<br>        }<br>    }<br>} <p>This object contains the keying material that will uniquely identify the piece of software making this request, as well as the proofing mechanism that software intends to use with that key. This is especially useful for clients that generate their keys locally: they can show up with a new key and just start working, as long as the server’s policy is OK with that kind of dynamic client. But in the OAuth 2 world, most of the clients are pre-registered, and it would seem silly and wasteful to force all developers to push all of their keying information in every request. So what the client can do instead is present a key handle in lieu of the key&nbsp;itself.</p> {<br>    "keys": "7C7C4AZ9KHRS6X63AJAO"<br>} <p>This handle stands in for the object shown in full above. Upon seeing this handle, the server looks up the key and proofing method that the handle refers to. Instead of passing the key by value, the client has effectively passed the key by reference using the handle construct. Since we’re talking about keying material, it’s important to note that we’re not just talking about a fingerprint or thumbprint here. The value of the key may not have any direct relationship to the value of the key itself, just so long as the AS knows what key it stands for. The key that the key handle points to can even change over time. In addition, the XYZ protocol already has some concessions for passing fingerprints and thumbprints instead of full keys, like this one for a TLS certificate.</p> {<br>    "keys": {<br>        "proof": "mtls",<br>        "cert#S256": "bwcK0esc3ACC3DB2Y5_lESsXE8o9ltc05O89jdN-dg2"<br>    }<br>} <p>From the XYZ protocol perspective, this is still passing the key by value, as it contains enough cryptographic information to identify the key and allow the AS to validate the incoming connection’s signatures. A handle can still be used instead of this hashed certificate value.</p><p>But now you might be thinking, where did the client get that key handle in the first&nbsp;place?</p> Static and Dynamic&nbsp;Handles <p>As long as the AS understands what the handle stands for and the client knows how to use it, the XYZ protocol doesn’t actually care how the parties learn of this handle. However, judging from experience with OAuth 2 and in particular dynamic registration, clients will probably be getting handles in one of a couple&nbsp;ways.</p><p>Static Handles are assigned to represent specific objects at some point before the transaction request. For a key handle, it’s probable that a developer filled in some information into an online registration form, including their public key. The AS generates a key handle that the developer can plug into their software and get started, or the developer could use their key directly. In both cases, the client is identified by its&nbsp;keys.</p><p>Dynamic Handles are assigned to represent specific objects in response to a transaction request. If the client presents an object by value in the request, the AS can, at runtime, generate a new handle and return it to the client software. For a key handle, the client can now send the handle in future requests instead of repeating its keying information. This is a huge boon for mobile applications, as they would be allowed to generate their keys locally and present them directly the first time they talked to a server, but then switch to the simpler and smaller key handle for subsequent requests with the same server. This gives us the benefits of dynamic client registration without a separate registration step being required.</p><p>You’ll notice that in both cases, the handle always translates from the AS to a specific object. The AS is fully in charge of the mapping between the handle and the object it represents, and so that means the AS can define and change that mapping as it needs to. For example, the AS can allow a developer to update a registered client’s public key without changing the key handle that the client sends. Or instead of one handle representing a single key, the handle could represent a family of certificates signed by a common root. The clients in question can always send the key itself or the handle they’ve been configured with.</p> What Do Handles Stand&nbsp;For? <p>In the current XYZ protocol, different parts of the incoming request can be represented by handles. Each of these handles is a little different, as is the information that they represent, but all use the same exact mechanism of a handle value standing in for an object that would otherwise be passed by value. As we’ve covered key handles in our examples above, let’s look at the other&nbsp;parts.</p><p>Resource Handles are simple strings that stand in for one of the potentially-complex objects that the client can use to specify what it wants to access. These strings are usually going to be defined by the API’s being protected, and they stand for common access patterns available at the API. In other words, they are equivalent to OAuth 2’s scope parameter. And in XYZ, the client can simultaneously request both handle and non-handle resources, allowing for rich authorization requests without mode switching.</p><p>Claims Handles are similar to resource handles in that they stand in for a set of user claims that the client is requesting.</p><p>Display Handles stand in for information that can be displayed to the user during an authorization request. These are most useful for dynamic and ephemeral clients, where the client will present all of this once and not need to again. These should be tied to a particular key in order to prevent impersonation of a client. Here we start to get close to the functionality of OAuth 2’s client_id, but dynamic registration and per-instance information of OAuth 2 clients as used in the wild has shown us that it’s valuable for them to vary independently. But for cases where it doesn’t need to vary, you can in fact use a client_id as the key handle and display handle for a <a href="https://github.com/mitreid-connect/OpenID-Connect-Java-Spring-Server/pull/1536">hybrid OAuth 2 and XYZ&nbsp;system</a>.</p><p>User Handles can be used with trusted client software to allow that client to assert, to the AS, that the same user is still there as they were previously. This can allow the AS to decide if it wants to shortcut the interaction process — after all, if it’s the same user and the client isn’t asking for something that needs additional approval, then just let them in. This is based on the Persisted Claims Token concept from UMA2. Unlike the claims, this represents what the client already knows about the user, not what it’s asking&nbsp;for.</p><p>Transaction Handles allow a client to refer to a whole ongoing transaction in the future. For example, while the client is polling, or when it receives the front channel response, or when it needs to respond to a challenge from the AS, the transaction handle allows the client to refer to the ongoing transaction object. It can also be used to do step-up and refresh authorization after an initial transaction has been completed. Unlike the other handles, this does not represent a single part of the request object, but rather the overall state. Therefore it’s not quite a handle in the same way, but it does at least represent something that the client is referring to. I think it’s likely that this needs a better, different name, but for the moment it’s a different kind of&nbsp;handle.</p> How Can The Protocol Express All&nbsp;This? <p>XYZ’s protocol is not just based on JSON, but it’s based on a particular technique known as polymorphic JSON. In this, a single field could have a different data type in different circumstances. For example, the resources field can be an array when requesting a single access token, or it can be an object when requesting multiple named access tokens. The difference in type indicates a difference in processing from the server. Within the resources array, each element can be either an object, representing a rich resource request description, or a string, representing a resource handle (scope). Importantly, the array can contain both of these at the same time — and it works semantically because they ultimately both refer to the same thing. The same construct is used for all of the different handles above. As a consequence, it’s clear to a developer that the handle is a replacement for, or a reference to, the object&nbsp;value.</p><p>While it might not be a mode that developers working in statically typed languages are used to, we have implemented this in a number of different platforms, including the famously strict&nbsp;Java.</p><p>In a more statically typed JSON protocol, these would need to be two different fields, each with its own type information. The fields would need to be defined as mutually-exclusive at the protocol level, like jwks and jwks_uri are for OAuth clients. This type of external interlock leads to consistency errors and complex verification schemes, especially as values change. By building the exclusivity into the protocol syntax, we can bypass all of that error-prone interlock checking. The resulting protocol definition is more clean, more concise, and more consistent.</p>

 Pan-Canadian Trust Framework Version 1.1 — Thematic Issues Going&nbsp;Forward We Conjure Our Own Spirit <a href="https://aci-iac.ca/art-books/norval-morrisseau/biography">Norval Morrisseau</a><p>Disclaimer: This is posted by me and does not represent the position of my employer or the working groups of which I am a&nbsp;member.</p><p>The Public Sector Profile of the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework Version 1.1 is now available on <a href="https://github.com/canada-ca/PCTF-CCP">GitHub</a>. This document reflects the collective effort of almost a year since we last posted <a href="https://medium.com/@trbouma/public-sector-profile-of-the-pan-canadian-trust-framework-version-1-0-4baf8ff0cfa0">Version 1.0 in July 2019</a>. Since then, the public sector (federal, provincial, territorial, and municipal) have met on almost a weekly basis with 20–28 participants on each call. The result is a truly Pan-Canadian perspective.</p><p>For this post, I won’t focus on what is in the latest version(please <a href="https://github.com/canada-ca/PCTF-CCP">read</a>!). Rather, I want to list the thematic issues we have identified as a group which we need to work on together to resolve. While Version 1.1 represents a huge milestone, there is still much exciting work ahead, which we have captured in the 11 thematic issues&nbsp;below.</p> Thematic Issue 1: Digital Relationships <p>We need to work on expanding our modeling and discussion of digital relationships — currently, there is not much more than a definition.</p> Thematic Issue 2: The Evolving State of Credentials <p>We now find ourselves in the middle of some very interesting developments in the areas of digital credentials. There is a sea-change happening in the industry where there is a movement from ‘information-sharing’ to ‘presenting digital proofs’. There is good work on standards (W3C) relating to verifiable credentials and decentralized identifiers.</p><p>Due to these new developments, we are now seeing the possibility that the traditional intermediated services (such as centralized/federated login providers) may disappear due to new technological advancements. This may not happen in the near future, but we are currently adjusting the PCTF model to incorporate the broader notion of a verifiable credential and are generalizing it to allow physical credentials (e.g., birth certificates, driver’s licenses) to evolve digitally within the&nbsp;model.</p><p>We are not sure that we have the model completely right (yet), but nonetheless Canada seems to be moving into the lead in understanding the implications of applying these technologies at ecosystem-scale (both public and private). As such, we are getting inquiries about how the PCTF might facilitate the migration to digital ecosystems and to new standards-based digital credentials, open-standards verification systems, and international interoperability.</p> Thematic Issue 3: Informed&nbsp;Consent <p>Informed consent is an evolving area and we don’t think the PCTF currently captures all the issues and nuances surrounding this topic especially in relation to the public sector. We have incorporated material from the DIACC and we have adjusted this material for public sector considerations, but we feel that much more work needs to be done. In the meantime, we feel that we have enough clarity in the PCTF to proceed with assessments — but we are ready to make changes if necessary.</p> Thematic Issue 4: Scope of the&nbsp;PCTF <p>Some have suggested that the scope of the PCTF should be broadened to include academic qualifications, professional designations, etc. We are currently experimenting with pilots in these areas with other countries. We have anticipated extensibility through the generalization of the PCTF model and the potential addition of new atomic processes. Keep in mind, however, that digital identity is a very specific but hugely important use case that we need to get right first. We are not yet ready to entertain a broadened scope for the PCTF into other areas, but soon we&nbsp;will.</p> Thematic Issue 5: Additional Detail <p>Many questions have been asked about the current version of this document in regard to the specific application of the PCTF. While we have a good idea, we still don’t have all of the answers. Much of this detail will be derived from the actual application of the PCTF (as was done with Alberta and British Columbia). The PCTF will be supplemented with detailed guidance in a separate document.</p> Thematic Issue 6: Unregistered Organizations <p>Currently, the scope of PCTF includes “all organizations registered in Canada (including inactive organizations) for which an identity has been established in Canada”. There are also many kinds of unregistered organizations operating in Canada such as sole proprietorships, trade unions, co-ops, NGOs, unregistered charities, and trusts. An analysis of these unregistered organizations in relation to the PCTF needs to be undertaken.</p> Thematic Issue 7: Assessing Outsourced Atomic Processes <p>Section 2.4.3 states&nbsp;that:</p><p>by design, the PCTF does not assume that a single provider is solely responsible for all of the atomic processes. Therefore, several bodies might be involved in the PCTF assessment process, focusing on different atomic processes, or different aspects (e.g., security, privacy, service delivery). Consideration must be given as to how to coordinate several bodies that might need to work together to yield an overall PCTF assessment. The organization being assessed is accountable for all parties within the scope of the assessment. The organization may decide that this is not feasible, nonetheless, the organization remains accountable. Such cases will be noted in the assessment.</p><p>The Issuer in this model is the authority ultimately accountable. Although an Issuer may choose to outsource or delegate the responsibility of the Credential Issuance atomic process to another body, the accountability remains with the&nbsp;Issuer.</p><p>We need to determine how multi-actor assessments will be conducted. It has been suggested that the organization being assessed should have the authority to speak to how well other organizations perform atomic processes on its&nbsp;behalf.</p> Thematic Issue 8: The Identity Continuity Atomic&nbsp;Process <p>The Identity Continuity atomic process is defined&nbsp;as:</p><p>the process of dynamically confirming that the Subject has a continuous existence over time (i.e., “genuine presence”). This process can be used to ensure that there is no malicious or fraudulent activity (past or present) and to address identity spoofing concerns.</p><p>It has been noted that there are privacy concerns with the notion of “dynamically confirming” the continuous existence of a Subject over time. We need to come up with a more precise and privacy-respecting definition of the Identity Continuity atomic&nbsp;process.</p> Thematic Issue 9: Signature <p>Appendix A defines signature as:</p><p>an electronic representation where at a minimum: the person signing the data can be associated with the electronic representation, it is clear that the person intended to sign, the reason or purpose for signing is conveyed, and the data integrity of the signed transaction is maintained, including the original.</p><p>We need to explore how the concept of signature is to be applied in the context of the&nbsp;PCTF.</p> Thematic Issue 10: Foundation Name, Primary Name, Legal&nbsp;Name <p>Appendix A has definitions for Foundation Name, Primary Name, and Legal&nbsp;Name.</p><p>The three terms more or less mean the same thing. We need to pick the preferred term and be consistent in its&nbsp;usage.</p> Thematic Issue 11: Review of the Appendices <p>At some point, we should undertake a full review of the current appendices.</p><p>For each appendix, we need to evaluate its utility, applicability, and appropriateness, and determine if it should continue to be included in the PCTF document. Some appendices will remain; some may be moved to a guidelines document; while others might be discarded outright. Some of the appendices that remain may need to be&nbsp;amended.</p><p>In closing, we remain on a journey of defining trust in a new way — not only for each institution or program but for the digital ecosystem as a whole. We are looking for ways to further broaden this perspective and I will keep you posted on new developments.</p>

  <p>Summary: How can I use Sovrin to perform age verification to minimize the personal data I have to keep? This blog post discusses the basics.</p>


<a></a>

<p>
    Kamea, a member of the Sovrin Telegram channel asked this question:
</p>
<blockquote>
    I’m looking for our users to sign up with a Sovrin account, validate their identity, then use it to verify age and passport country on our network using a zk proof so we don’t have to handle any personal data.
</blockquote>

<p>
    There are actually two different things here and it's useful to separate them.
</p>

<p>
    First, there's no such thing as a "Sovrin account". SSI doesn't have accounts, it has relationships and credentials. But your company will have accounts. The way that works is you set up an enterprise agency on your side to create a relationship (technically a peer DID exchange) with anyone who wants to create an account with you. After they establish that relationship, you can begin to collect attributes you need to provide service. Some of those will be self asserted and some you might require credentials depending on your use case.
</p>

<p>
    The second thing is determining which credentials you want to require. If your requirement is an attested proof of age, then there could be several choices. In an ideal world, people would have a number of those (e.g. national ID, drivers license, passport, bank KYC, etc.) In the current world, you might have to partner with someone like Onfido or another KYC company do give people a way to get their age verified and a credential to use in proving it. Once people have this credential, however, it gives them the means of proving their age (and likely other attributes) anywhere, not just to you.
</p>

<p>
    Kamea mentioned the desire to avoid handling personal data and this is a good solution for that. The proof would record that the person was over 18 and their country of residence without seeing or recording any other information.
</p>

<p>
    I recommend running through the <a href="https://try.connect.me">demo at Connect.me</a> to see how all this could work. There are a number of vendors who can supply help with enterprise agencies and consulting on how to set this up in your organization.

I’ve talked with a variety of different people and companies about how it fits and doesn’t fit their use cases, I’ve presented it at a number of different conferences, and I’ve submitted that work into the IETF in the hopes of starting a new standards working group based on what we’ve built and&nbsp;learned.</p><p>With that in mind, I wanted to take some time here to discuss a number of the core aspects of XYZ: why it has the engineering decisions it does and what the effects those decisions have on the resulting system. But I wanted to start this with a look at a more fundamental question: Why am I doing&nbsp;this?</p> Why Not Extend OAuth&nbsp;2? <p><a href="https://medium.com/@justinsecurity/moving-on-from-oauth-2-629a00133ade">I’ve covered OAuth 2’s shortcomings in the past</a>, and overcoming these shortcomings was a key motivation for starting this project. Many of these shortcomings can be overcome by patching the existing framework with <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-par">new functions</a>, <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-parecki-oauth-v2-1">new restrictions</a>, and <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-rar">new techniques</a>. OAuth 2 has a long and storied history of doing this, and I’ve been the editor for three such specifications myself along with a whole litany of proposed extensions, profiles, and other work. OAuth 2 is not going away, and in fact I do think that patching it up makes sense for those that want to or need to keep using it. I know I’m going to keep using it to solve problems, and I expect to keep teaching classes and doing engineering work on it for a long time&nbsp;yet.</p><p>But I still think <a href="https://medium.com/@justinsecurity/the-case-for-oauth-3-0-why-now-a15ffdc77fd5">we’ve come to the point where we’ve patched the framework so much</a> that it’s becoming more fragile and less flexible. We need to start looking to the future before the future surprises us. We already have needs that OAuth 2 doesn’t solve very well, even with all its extensions. People are off inventing their own point solutions right now, but that doesn’t have to be the case forever. We stand a much better chance of success if we learn from the evolution of OAuth 2 and build from that, throwing away things that didn’t work out or didn’t age&nbsp;well.</p> Why Build&nbsp;XYZ? <p>I started XYZ as an exercise of stepping back from OAuth 2’s model of the world, and the assumptions that come with it, to see what the world could look like without those constraints. XYZ was my attempt of answering the question, “What if OAuth had been made today with what we know&nbsp;now?”</p><p>Some have described XYZ as “OAuth 2, if we knew better,” and I take that as a high compliment. But it’s important to know that it’s not a completely radical departure, and in fact <a href="https://github.com/mitreid-connect/OpenID-Connect-Java-Spring-Server/pull/1536">XYZ has been designed to be layered into OAuth 2 based platforms</a> and re-use many concepts in a new and consistent way.</p> Why Make a Standard? <p>This is always a hard question. The standards process is <a href="https://medium.com/@justinsecurity/standards-or-how-to-program-engineers-fef923eb91c4">fraught with stress and peril</a>, and you <a href="https://medium.com/@justinsecurity/a-sandwich-of-bread-and-magic-bfad962b9f28">don’t always get the best results</a> from it. If I had kept XYZ as a simple standalone project, life would almost certainly be easier. The handful of groups that are implementing the draft protocol would still be able to do so, and as an open source project it would continue to grow and be available for anyone who wanted to do with&nbsp;it.</p><p>And I would retain complete control. But therein lies a problem: there are a LOT of really smart people out there, and I think this idea is so much bigger than me. And so I set out to start the process of <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/charter-ietf-txauth/">proposing a new working group in the IETF</a> to both bring in smart people and provide a mixing bowl for all their good ideas, along with mine. If this is going to be robust and powerful, like I think it can be, then it needs a strong and diverse community to build&nbsp;it.</p> What’s In a&nbsp;Name? <p>The name XYZ is somewhat of an accident, since I bought the domain oauth.xyz simply because I saw it was available (and on sale!), and I didn’t have any plans for it right away. It became a place to host my writeup of “what-comes-after-OAuth-2” and therefore lent its name to the result. Since this wasn’t really OAuth, it became known as&nbsp;XYZ.</p><p>I’m the first to admit that XYZ is not a great name for a project. It’s not unique, it’s hard to search for, it doesn’t stand for anything in particular, and more importantly it’s a common way to say something is a stand-in. But that’s just it: it was always meant to be a functional placeholder for what would come next. An experiment in progress, one with real code and real systems working together, but far from a final product. You can deploy XYZ as a protocol today, but it’s going to change going forward as the work continues. I still think <a href="https://medium.com/@justinsecurity/the-case-for-oauth-3-0-5c7537e3f9c3">we could call the next big thing that we’re working on OAuth 3</a>, but that’s for the wider OAuth community to decide when the time is&nbsp;right.</p><p>I think it’s likely that XYZ will live on as an implementation of what comes out of the standards process, even as that&nbsp;changes.</p> What’s In It For&nbsp;You? <p>I don’t usually like to get personal here on my professional blog, but some people have been positing why I’ve been doing this work myself. I’ve been accused of trying to subvert the OAuth 2 world and drive OAuth 2 implementors out of business by causing market confusion. This doesn’t make any sense to me considering several of my clients are OAuth 2 implementors. I want them to continue to succeed, and I think the fear of something new is unfounded and bad business sense. I’ve also been accused of doing this to get famous. To that I say I genuinely doubt that being a part of the creation process for a security protocol that most people won’t ever see is going to make me more well-known than I already am, at least in the circles that care about such things. At the moment, I’m lucky enough that my consulting company is fully booked — if not more than full — and I’m having to divert some incoming projects to others. I’ve also been accused of having some secret project that I’m trying to push onto the world, or a stealth start up that I’m trying to drive in a first-to-market situation. Simply put, I don’t have anything like that. All the prototype code and specifications are open source under liberal licenses. So no, I’m not doing this to get rich and/or&nbsp;famous.</p><p>The real reason is a lot more mundane and yet it still confuses people: I want the internet to be better, and I see this as an opportunity to make a difference. I started XYZ as a concept and prototype before any companies talked to me about building it. It was after I had shown that there was something real to this idea that people started to find me because it was a solution that fit the problems that they’re seeing. The feedback and experience of the last year and a half have radically changed the details of XYZ, but the core concepts are still there and still feel&nbsp;sound.</p><p>So what’s in it for me? The same thing that’s in it for you: more security, easier development, wider use cases, and a better internet. I don’t know why some think that this isn’t motivation enough, but I promise I’m not hiding ulterior&nbsp;motives.</p> What’s Next? <p>I hope that at this point it’s more clear why I started XYZ and why I am trying to start the TxAuth group at IETF. In the next few blog posts, I plan to go over some of the key features of the XYZ protocol and explain why they are important and what they bring that OAuth 2 was lacking. Things like passing by reference handles, proof of possession, interaction models, and extensibility all have key roles, and they’ve been explicitly designed into XYZ over the last year and a half. While all of this is covered in some depth on <a href="https://oauth.xyz/">the XYZ website</a>, I think it’s time to push the conversation even&nbsp;further.</p>

<p>Introduction: This article is a brief on the essence of a Pan-African approach towards technological innovation, resilience, and the possibilities of a robust software approach in problem solving for&nbsp;Africa.</p><p>Pan-Africanism has been hailed for years by greats like Toussaint Louverture of the Haitian revolution in the 18th century to Kwame Nkrumah in the 20th century as the ideal that individuals of African descent, in the continent and the diaspora, ought to contribute towards a collective self-reliance to fulfill the potential of the continent. Fast forward to the present day with the presence of the African Union, constituted to help achieve the Pan-African agenda and now propelled by Agenda 2063, the blueprint and master plan for transforming Africa into the global powerhouse of the&nbsp;future.</p>the Black Star Gate,&nbsp;Accra<p>Agenda 2063 is a mission of the AU to ensure that Africa occupies a powerhouse status by the year 2063. Its most visible component yet is the decision to have the continent as a single trade block allowing free movement of goods and services across borders thus championing intra-continental trade. This is under the African Continental Free Trade Area Agreement that makes Africa the biggest trade block in the world only followed by the World Trade Organization. For starters, this translates to a combined gross domestic product (GDP) of more than $3.4 Trillion ($3,400,000,000,000) and a combined population of 1.4 Billion people when the ACFTA comes into effect on July 1,&nbsp;2020.</p><p>The free trade area will result in significant reductions in trade tariffs and quotas and free movement of people, goods and services while transacting in the single continental market. Gradually, the vision of the founding fathers of the Pan-African movement to achieve unity, self-determination, freedom, progress and collective prosperity of the African people will become a reality. However, to be within the range of achieving Agenda 2063 fully, a Pan-African technological approach is the best shot at getting&nbsp;there.</p><p>A Pan-African Technological Approach</p><p>The Pan-African technological approach to employ is a combination of bits and atoms, hardware based innovations in harmony with software solutions designed to adapt with the African way of life. As such, this demands resourcefulness, multiple areas of application of the said innovation, and the ability to be adaptable over time and for the widest range of Africans on the continent and in the diaspora. This would be the engine that powers the legal tools, the ideas and earlier policy frameworks to enable implementation at scale and in the shortest time possible.</p><p>According to the UN World Population Prospects Report of 2017, Africa will boast of the largest young number of people in the world by 2050. With the quality of life set to improve and with growing numeracy and literacy levels, such a youthful population sets the continent at a massive “leap-frogging” advantage in multiple sectors of her economy. It is this population that will constitute a significant portion of the global labour force and with the increasing integration of technology into daily life and at the workplace, it should not be out of form when creative approaches emerge to solving age-old problems that have faced us as a&nbsp;people.</p>Comparison of Youthful Population by Region between 2017 and&nbsp;2050<p>2020 and&nbsp;Beyond</p><p>Digital financial services (DFS) keep contributing to the introduction into Information Communication Technology and usage of mobile phones for most Africans entering the digital economy. Hence DFS solutions maintain their position as the “Gateway” to the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) based innovations. EdTech and Entertainment will also be significant Gateways in the emerging post-Covid world. Specific areas gaining traction are the use of Artificial Intelligence to build smarter systems &amp; inform decision making and the adoption of Blockchain Technologies to build resilient data, financial &amp; verification systems as evident in Kenya, Nigeria, Tunisia and&nbsp;Rwanda.</p><p>From Kenya, I co-created Blockchain software for Digital Identity with a group of Pan-African technologists as part of the Identity Working Group of the African Digital Asset Framework. The project, called Kweli (Kiswahili for Truth) is based on a research paper, authored between early 2019 and released in January 2020. Kweli proposes a Digital Trust model to enable secure digital transactions in a privacy preserving way pegged on identities of Africans locally and in the diaspora. The most efficient way we identified to achieve a system like <a href="https://kweli.adaf.io/">Kweli</a> is if such a model was built as a blockchain identity network that allows for flexibility of control over ones own identity and associated data. This approach is generally termed as Decentralized Identity or Self-sovereign Identity.</p><p>A Pan-African Technological Approach would only be efficient if driven by projects built as Open-Source and adopting Open Technology Standards. An Open Source approach seeds innovations based on the initial project either by improvement on it or as inspiration to future complex projects. Consequently, it births a strong community of contributors and supporters all working towards the success of the project. We built Kweli as Free and Open Source Software with this in&nbsp;mind.</p><p>It will be exciting to observe similar projects cropping up in fields such as Robotics, Internet of Things powered solutions, Artificial Intelligence, and 3D Printing that will provide creative solutions for Africans. While a solution like Kweli may have barely scratched the surface, it is a bold step worthy enough to contribute towards the visions of Pan-Africanists from the founding days to the present day Pan-African chugging along in their own unique contribution.</p><p>Links to References</p><p>Agenda 2063 - <a href="https://au.int/en/agenda2063">https://au.int/en/agenda2063</a></p><p>African Continental Free Trade Area - <a href="https://au.int/en/ti/cfta/about">https://au.int/en/ti/cfta/about</a></p><p>UN Population Report - <a href="https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Publications/Files/WPP2017_KeyFindings.pdf">https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Publications/Files/WPP2017_KeyFindings.pdf</a></p><p>The Fourth Industrial Revolution in Africa — <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-fourth-industrial-revolution-and-digitization-will-transform-africa-into-a-global-powerhouse/">https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-fourth-industrial-revolution-and-digitization-will-transform-africa-into-a-global-powerhouse</a></p><p>Kweli: Pan-African Self-sovereign Identity - <a href="https://kweli.adaf.io/">https://kweli.adaf.io</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/vibranium-id/kweli-pan-african-self-sovereign-identity-framework-78b6e9f38fc4">Kweli - Pan-African Self-sovereign Identity Framework</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/vibranium-id">Vibranium ID</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Last week, a security researcher discovered and disclosed a <a href="https://bhavukjain.com/blog/2020/05/30/zeroday-signin-with-apple/">zero-day bug in Sign In with Apple</a>, and collected a $100,000 bounty.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Sign In with Apple is similar to OAuth and OpenID Connect, with Apple’s own spin on it. While there were some critical bugs due to Apple’s initial poor implementation of OpenID Connect, <a href="https://openid.net/2019/06/27/open-letter-from-the-openid-foundation-to-apple-regarding-sign-in-with-apple/">as documented by the OpenID Foundation</a>, those bugs were fixed relatively quickly.</p>

<p>The zero-day bug that was recently discovered actually had nothing to do with the OAuth or OpenID Connect part of the Sign In with Apple exchange, and very little to do even with JWTs. Let’s take a closer look to see what actually happened.</p>

 

<p>Disclaimer: I do not have any inside knowledge about Apple's systems. The information in post is based on the original writeup by <a href="https://bhavukjain.com/blog/2020/05/30/zeroday-signin-with-apple/">Bhavuk Jain</a> and my own observations using Apple's API.</p>

 

<p>The <a href="https://bhavukjain.com/blog/2020/05/30/zeroday-signin-with-apple/">original writeup</a> heavily mentions JWTs and emphasizes the OAuth exchange, and I’ve seen many reactions suggesting that the problem was in the JWT creation or validation, or some poor implementation of OpenID Connect. But instead, the problem was much actually much simpler than that.</p>

 Breaking down the OAuth Flow 

<p>In an OAuth or OpenID Connect flow, the specs talk about the communication from the client requesting the token to the server generating the token. The steps where the user authenticates with the server are intentionally left out of the specs, since those are considered implementation details of the server.</p>

 
 The application initiates an OAuth request by sending the user to the authorization server. This part is the “authorization request” step in the specs. 
 The user authenticates, and may see a consent screen where they approve the request from the application. This part is “out of scope” of the specs. 
 The authorization server generates an authorization code or ID token in the response and sends the user back to the application. This is the “authorization response” step in the specs. 
 

<p><br>
Let’s take a closer look at step 2, the part that you won’t find any direction from the specs when building.</p>

<p>A simple implementation for first-party applications may only ask the user to authenticate with a password.</p>

<p></p>

<p>More secure scenarios may involve the user being asked for a second authentication factor.</p>

<p></p>

<p>For third-party applications, the authorization server will often ask the user to confirm the request the application makes with a consent screen.</p>

<p></p>

<p>All of these steps happen outside of what the OAuth and OpenID Connect specs define. These are decisions that the authorization server makes in terms of which and how many of these steps to take.</p>

<p>All of these interstitial screens will have some server-side code at the authorization server that responds to the buttons the user presses.</p>

<p>This is where the flaw with Apple happened.</p>

 Apple’s Unique OAuth Consent Screen 

<p>Apple has a unique feature of their consent screen which lets the user choose whether to share their real email with the application or a randomized proxy email instead. The user can also choose to edit their name that is shared with the application. Both of these features are a great step in the direction of preserving privacy and empowering the user.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Let’s imagine a simplified example of how this could be built. The server shows this page to the user, and provides an HTML form that will be submitted back with the options the user chooses.</p>

<p>The options are the user’s name and an email address. Whichever the user selects will be sent back to the server, and the server will continue on with issuing the OAuth authorization response. The name is intended to be user-editable, so it makes sense that whatever the user enters here will be sent to the server. The email address however, should only be toggled between one of the user’s registered email addresses or the generated proxy address. The problem with Apple’s implementation was essentially that in this step, the email is sent to the server and the server accepted whatever email was given. The attack is to intercept this part of the flow when logging in yourself, and put in the victim’s email address in the request to the server. That would cause Apple to eventually generate a JWT with the victim’s email address in it, which the application would then use.</p>

<p>Here’s an example of an HTML form that has this problem. This is obviously simplified compared to Apple’s actual implementation, but I’m just trying to get the point across.</p>

 <code>&lt;form action="/confirm" method="post"&gt;
  &lt;input type="text" name="name" value="Aaron Parecki"&gt;
  &lt;select name="email"&gt;
    &lt;option value="aaron@parecki.com"&gt;Share my Email&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option value="xxxx012345@privaterelay.apple.com"&gt;Hide my Email&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;/select&gt;
  &lt;input type="submit" value="Confirm"&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code> 

<p>This allows the user to edit their name and choose whether to share their real email or proxy email with the application.</p>

<p>The problem is in the form validation of this method on the Apple servers. Clearly someone who wanted to could change the values before submitting the form. For example, replacing the value of the “Share my Email” option with the email of their victim. Apple was not validating this email, so it was accepting whatever the client sent.</p>

<p>The result of this form action is eventually the client application would get a JWT which would contain the email address of the victim instead of that of the Apple account owner.</p>

<p>Here’s a way to build this form that would have avoided this problem in the first place.</p>

 <code>&lt;form action="/confirm" method="post"&gt;
  &lt;input type="text" name="name" value="Aaron Parecki"&gt;
  &lt;select name="email"&gt;
    &lt;option value="real_email"&gt;Share my Email&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option value="proxy_email"&gt;Hide my Email&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;/select&gt;
  &lt;input type="submit" value="Confirm"&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code> 

<p>In this version of the form, the <code>name</code> field is still editable, since it’s intentional that the user can type whatever they want in that field. But now, the value of the <code>email</code> field sent to the server will be either <code>real_email</code> or <code>proxy_email</code>, and the server will assign the appropriate value server-side. This prevents the user from being able to inject a victim’s email address into this exchange.</p>

<p>The other way to solve this would be to validate on the server side that the submitted email matches one that is already on the user's account, which is likely what they did since Apple's actual form does still include the email address as the value.</p>

<p>While this is obviously a simplified version of how Sign in with Apple works, it is meant to illustrate the bug and show how this is a common problem in any system that accepts user input.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, this was a problem with Apple not verifying external input from a form submission.</p>

<p>Just remember, this bug was a lack of form validation.</p>

 But what about the JWT? 

<p>There have been a lot of comments about how this is also a problem with JWTs, either lack of JWT validation or suggesting that somehow it was a misuse of some OpenID Connect claims. There is another half of the story here in order to actually pull off this attack on a real application.</p>

<p>Given the bug above, an attacker was able to start signing in to an application, and swap the <code>email</code> claim in the JWT that was issued with a value of their choosing. The application would end up with a JWT such as the example below:</p>

<p>Raw JWT:</p>

 <code>eyJraWQiOiJlWGF1bm1MIiwiYWxnIjoiUlMyNTYifQ.eyJpc3MiOiJodHRwczovL2FwcGxlaWQuYXBwbGUuY29tIiwiYXVkIjoibG9sLmF2b2NhZG8uY2xpZW50IiwiZXhwIjoxNTkwOTU0ODk1LCJpYXQiOjE1OTA5NTQyOTUsInN1YiI6IjAwMTQ3My5mZTZmODNiZjRiOGU0NTkwYWFjYmFiZGNiODU5OGJkMC4yMDM5Iiwibm9uY2UiOiJlODU5ZjE0MWI1IiwiYXRfaGFzaCI6Ii1wVlROTDUxSWx3X1dxZjNOOGdlQmciLCJlbWFpbCI6ImFhcm9uQHBhcmVja2kuY29tIiwiZW1haWxfdmVyaWZpZWQiOiJ0cnVlIiwiYXV0aF90aW1lIjoxNTkwOTU0Mjk0LCJub25jZV9zdXBwb3J0ZWQiOnRydWV9.rjHR_fuHKxyDt4vd9nLS5DnsEhDC4X1krR-qsiWr68uWkP8gCM2D-x3sa5_N6RFoITrqkwl6CBBPv07-LBcbndeNDP9bf4ztAtjs77CFkixoFFxQSqcc7oT28cDIzH6btyKveqRKSe1C1Fy-1ltxQRjDvAj4xDZTfAXzFrBMbeutx32zmXR8l4KbQaacjpASr8yfUKRCS8lAOk30zlALww2Zx1T0XB-swpsNhpum4nVo6iK7KOpgcY0teFxtf4xwXYGMTm-WQQJZZ65uHNdd99LGnyE_iflQvsm8iq3B7-eKpoC90uImoeN8W3W5AbFNhOY1z8yVsOtDSth9SQCvvA
</code> 

<p>Decoded:</p>

 <code>{
  "kid": "eXaunmL",
  "alg": "RS256"
}
.
{
  "iss": "https://appleid.apple.com",
  "aud": "lol.avocado.client",
  "exp": 1590954895,
  "iat": 1590954295,
  "sub": "001473.fe6f83bf4b8e4590aacbabdcb8598bd0.2039",
  "nonce": "e859f141b5",
  "at_hash": "-pVTNL51Ilw_Wqf3N8geBg",
  "email": "attacker@example.com",
  "email_verified": "true",
  "auth_time": 1590954294,
  "nonce_supported": true
}
.
(signature)
</code> 

<p>The application would then validate the JWT by checking the signature, and consider the user “logged in”. Since Apple did in fact generate this JWT, the signature would be valid, so the application wouldn’t know any better that the email address was not legitimate.</p>

<p>This points to the next problem, which only some applications would be vulnerable to.</p>

<p>In order to actually use this attack against the application, the application would have to be looking at only the <code>email</code> claim to identify the user who signed in. This is not the intent of OpenID Connect or Sign in with Apple.</p>

<p>Applications should be using the <code>sub</code> value to identify the user, as the <code>sub</code> value is meant to be a stable identifier for users, whereas the email address on their account may change for various reasons. If an application uses only the <code>email</code> to identify the user, then it would be vulnerable to this kind of account takeover given the bug with Apple I described above.</p>

<p>But here's the real problem, and why Apple making up their own variations on the standard leads to things like this. Notice that the user's name doesn't appear anywhere in the ID token? That's because Apple decided that the user's name should actually only be delivered to the application once, the first time they log in to the app, and it is delivered in the <code>form_post</code> response body rather than in the ID token.</p>

<p>Yes, that means the payload your redirect URI gets will be a POST request with the following request body:</p>

 <code>state=8c9b5acdc8
&amp;code=cb337ce2c688f45f6b537498acb6599fe.0.nruxt.QrMBT0tzG2Ssqs-T1L5hqA
&amp;user={"name":{"firstName":"Aaron","lastName":"Parecki"},"email":"attacker@example.com"}
</code> 

<p>The application is expected to then exchange that code for the ID token, but notice that the name and email are already sent here? An app developer might look at that and say "well that was easy, I'll just use these values and stop there". This is where Apple would have returned the wrong email address using the technique above, so if app developers use the email address in this response to identify users, they would be vulnerable.</p>

<p>It would be safer for Apple to not have sent user data back in this redirect at all, and instead always return it from the token endpoint in the ID token. That way app developers could be sure that the data did in fact originate from Apple and wasn't modified.</p>

 So was this really a zero-day? 

<p>Apple paid $100,000 for the bounty, which is the maximum amount they list for <a href="https://developer.apple.com/security-bounty/">"Unauthorized access to iCloud account data on Apple Servers"</a>. This suggests that some of Apple’s own applications were vulnerable to this somehow, because otherwise this would have only affected access to data of third party apps.</p>

<p>I've never seen Apple apps using Sign in with Apple themselves, typically they use their own built in Apple ID authentication directly. However it’s certainly possible that Apple is moving towards Sign in with Apple even for their own apps, as that would be a huge step up in security compared to what they have now, for all the same reasons that <a href="https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/password/">entering passwords directly in applications is dangerous</a>.</p>

 How to prevent these kinds of bugs in your own services? 

<p>Rule number 1: <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html">Validate your form inputs</a>!</p>

<p>Rule number 2: Never roll your own authentication.</p>

<p>We have standards like OAuth which represent years of experience across a wide range of companies documenting best practices building this stuff. And while it’s certainly possible to make mistakes when building an OAuth implementation, at least you have the benefit of leaning on the rest of the security community to find and document problems and patterns for building it securely.</p>

<p>If you’re going to run or build your own OAuth server instead of using an <a href="https://developer.okta.com">existing service</a> or <a href="https://oauth.net/code/">open source product</a>, take a very careful look at all of the OAuth RFCs and make sure you know what you’re getting in to before you start.</p>

<p>Even Apple made this mistake when they first rolled out Sign in with Apple. They had loosely based it off of OpenID Connect, but left out a few critical pieces that were necessary to make it a secure implementation. These were quickly <a href="https://bitbucket.org/openid/connect/src/master/How-Sign-in-with-Apple-differs-from-OpenID-Connect.md">documented by the OpenID Connect community</a> and Apple later fixed them, mostly.</p>

<p>Don't be like Apple, use existing open standards.</p>

 DIF I&amp;D WG: Starting work on cryptographic secret&nbsp;recovery <p>One of the most important challenges that remain in decentralized identity architecture is the key management. The whole point of a <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot1-sf/blob/master/final-documents/dpki.pdf">Decentralized Public Key Infrastructure</a> (which is the underlying paradigm that has led to the development of Decentralized Identifiers and many other related technologies) is that individuals, organizations, and things create and manage their own cryptographic keys without reliance on a central authority or intermediary. But as we know, with great power comes great responsibility — in this case, while we have the power to wield private keys that control DIDs, we can also lose everything connected to those DIDs if we can’t retain and secure them. By definition, in a decentralized identity system, there is no centralized service to provide an “I forgot my password” button.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@thisusuallyworks">Richard&nbsp;Payette</a><p>That is the starting condition. It is certainly possible to build safeguards and recovery mechanisms into a decentralized identity system. Such mechanisms can be as simple as creating a backup of a wallet that holds cryptographic keys or writing down a seed number on a piece of paper. Many key recovery techniques that are popular in the cryptocurrency community can also be applied to decentralized identity. Some of the better-known approaches are <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki">mnemonic seed phrases</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing">Shamir’s Secret Sharing</a> algorithm.</p><p>Despite the existence of approaches to make key recovery simpler and better, there is still much need for innovation. This is the reason why the <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/identifiers-discovery.html">DIF Identifiers &amp; Discovery Working Group</a> is excited to announce an open call for contributions and development of new secret recovery schemes, and implementations. To kick off work in this area, Microsoft, a member of the DIF I&amp;D WG, will be contributing a scheme called ‘Fuzzy Vault,’ which incorporates many desirable, human-friendly features into a single recovery scheme. Daniel Buchner of Microsoft will be posting soon to detail their contribution to the ‘Fuzzy Vault’ scheme to this DIF I&amp;D WG initiative. The whitepaper for the ‘Fuzzy Vault’ scheme will be published in this DIF repository: <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/fuzzy-vault">https://github.com/decentralized-identity/fuzzy-vault</a>. The code implementation and any specifications required for ‘Fuzzy Vault’ will be developed within the DIF I&amp;D&nbsp;WG.</p><p>Another approach DIF participants have worked on is a mnemonic scheme encoded as a 3D experience, called Seed Quest. This scheme uses geo-temporal-spatial inputs, which are more human-friendly than traditional word inputs. The scheme provides 128 bits of entropy for seed recovery with a mnemonic sequence that requires minimal rehearsal: <a href="https://github.com/reputage/seedQuest">https://github.com/reputage/seedQuest</a>. DIF members have recently discussed ways to combine these schemes to maximize UX and recoverability.</p><p>These two efforts are just the beginning of DIF’s work in the area of secret retention and recovery. We encourage everyone to contribute their ideas, code, and insights to this vital work.

  Since February of 2020, I have been spending time with the mm-ADT, or multi-model abstract data type, project. I am not an expert by any means, but Dr. Marko Rodriguez and Dr. Ryan Wisnesky have been gracious to me on the Slack channel.   Marko has been coding since he was 12 and since has become a pioneer in the graph database movement with his development of the graph traversal language Gremlin.

Since February of 2020, I have been spending time with the <a href="http://www.mm-adt.org/">mm-ADT</a>, or multi-model abstract data type, project. I am not an expert by any means, but <a href="https://markorodriguez.com/">Dr. Marko Rodriguez</a> and <a href="https://www.wisnesky.net/">Dr. Ryan Wisnesky</a> have been gracious to me on the Slack channel. <br><br>Marko has been coding since he was 12 and since has become a pioneer in the graph database movement with his development of the graph traversal language <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gremlin_(query_language)">Gremlin</a>. He worked on an early implementation in <a href="http://tinkerpop.apache.org/">Apache TinkerPop</a> and commercialized Gremlin in Titan through his company Aurelius [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zee9TCXU--A">1</a>,<a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/gremlin-users/p2vo0J8jou8/Lr0r0cIdBwAJ">2</a>,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkAYA4Kd8JE">3</a>,<a href="http://titan.thinkaurelius.com/">4</a>].<br><br>Gremlin provides a virtual machine that allows people to express queries functionally on data that can be interpreted as a graph. A variety of programming and query languages can work together to compile to byte code used to execute Gremlin traversals.<br><br>Ryan worked with <a href="https://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/">Dr. David Spivak</a> to manipulate databases using category theory. It is described extensively in both David and Ryan's talks [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk36__qkhrk">5</a>,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkHce4zWmUk">6</a>] and has been commercialized through <a href="https://conexus.ai/">Conexus</a>. Ryan Holbrook also observed the work and produced and excellent talk [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJrVKZULiLU">7</a>].<br><br>Conexus' product, the <a href="https://www.categoricaldata.net/">Categorical Query Language</a> allows users to apply various database tasks such as"querying, combining, migrating, and evolving" using provably correct algebra.<br><br>Marko and Ryan are among the group congregating in a new mm-ADT community.&nbsp; The goal is to have Languages, Processors, and Databases interconnect. if this is confusing, look at Actors in the distributed computer sense for where this is headed [<a href="https://www.brianstorti.com/the-actor-model/">8</a>]. However, Actors are inclusive to mm-ADT since it is more general. <br><br>Algebra described in the String Ring Theory paper [<a href="https://zenodo.org/record/2565243#.Xs2irBZOlFR">9</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19235158">+</a>], combined with category theory, is being implemented in the mm-ADT project. What might have been a variation and for TinkerPop3 has now become generalized algebraic approach that is applicable to more than things resembling graphs. This generalized approach was described by Marko in the GQL Community Update [<a href="https://www.gqlstandards.org/community-updates">10</a>], ApacheCon in 2019 [<a href="https://www.slideshare.net/slidarko/mmadt-a-multimodel-abstract-data-type">11</a>] , and DataDays in 2020 [<a href="https://www.slideshare.net/slidarko/mmadt-a-virtual-machinean-economic-machine">12</a>]. <br><br>Joshua Shinavier has also followed the mathematical trend in TinkerPop by working on Algebraic Property Graphs with Ryan Wisnesky [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.04881">13</a>] and giving a talk at the Global Graph Summit (co-located with DataDays) [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrFz64aF5sY">14</a>]. <br><br>My involvement with this community came conveniently when a friend urged me to start a project that aimed to track data from at least nationally distributed IoT devices. <br><br>tl;dr: Marko began following me during the mid-summer of 2019.

<p>Question I received yesterday: </p>



<p>Do you know anything about the Inslee administration giving the okay to dormitory housing for all the Yakima farmworkers who are dying of the virus?</p>



<a href="https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2020/may/22/agricultural-workers-in-central-washington-strike-/"></a>Agricultural workers strike this month in Yakima, calling for officials at Columbia Reach to enforce safety measures that will protect workers against COVID-19 and provide them with hazard pay during the pandemic. <br>(Photo courtesy Edgar Franks) – <a href="https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2020/may/22/agricultural-workers-in-central-washington-strike-/">The Spokesman-Review</a>



<p>My reply:&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Sadly I learned that Washington’s agribusiness does not want to protect its migrant workforce. The unions do not want to protect the migrant workers either. The unions gave up their original demand that the top bunks not be used to enable social distancing while sleeping. The fact that the virus can spread while breathing in and out when a mask is absent was ignored. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile state and county public health workers are trying to keep the migrant workers from getting infected and spreading infection….&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-05-07/washington-farmworker-coronavirus">This article in the LA Times.</a>..not reported in the Seattle Times may enlighten you:</p>



<p>During last week’s call with Washington State’s Dept of Commerce, I learned that Yakima County has the highest rate of COVID-19 infections not only in WA State, but&nbsp; <a href="https://www.yakimaherald.com/special_projects/coronavirus/update/yakima-countys-coronavirus-rate-highest-on-west-coast/article_203862c6-d516-5ae7-b9f4-87a278221d14.html">among all counties on the West Coast</a>. At that time over 2,600 people were infected with coronavirus in Yakima County, roughly 15% are agriculture and food production workers, according to the Yakima Health District.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yakima Health officials are battling outbreaks at long-term care facilities and the county has the largest population of essential workers in Washington State. The CDC and OSHA have provided no written guidelines.</p>



<p>Washington State commissioned a work group who made recommendations, including at least 75 square feet for sleeping. Only bottom units of bunk beds can be used unless a housing unit is being occupied by a single family. It is left to each county’s public health officials to negotiate with each employer – and it is insane, unsafe and even deadly.</p>



<p>The pandemic is rippling through the region’s agricultural industries, sparking labor strikes and I heard a lawsuit, but I have not seen the complaint nor do I know which farm biz was sued.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Striking workers say they want more masks, gloves, disinfectant, plastic dividers between workers on the production line, and a $2 per hour increase in pay. Workers throughout the various company strikes echo those demands.&nbsp; </p><p>Workers have also demanded that their employers inform them who exactly tested positive so they can know if they may have been exposed. Company managers say that by law they can’t give out private health information of employees.&nbsp; </p><a href="https://www.nwpb.org/2020/05/21/are-their-apples-worth-more-than-our-lives-yakima-valley-fruit-workers-strike-for-protections-pay/">– Are Apples worth more then our lives</a></blockquote>



<p>In May over 400 Yakima Valley fruit packing workers have gone on strike, according to Familias Unidas Por La Justicia (FUJ). The farmworker advocacy group, based in Skagit County, is helping workers organize committees, negotiate with employers and seek legal advice.&nbsp;Unclear if anyone from the NLG is participating.</p>



<p>One worker shared what workers need: “That’s why we need a plan that gives us security to go to work, work safely, and return home and be okay.”</p>



<p>Now all 50 states are reopening – and the American worker has no OSHA guidance.&nbsp;  Now, workers fear for their lives. “<a href="https://www.dw.com/en/coronavirus-us-workers-fear-for-their-jobs-and-their-health/a-53511146">People are scared. Especially when they’re working close together</a>, if they’re not being provided with masks or other personal protective equipment, or if there unable to wash their hands,” says Shelly Ruzicka, Arise Chicago.</p>



<p>There have been more than 200 walkouts/strikes in the country <a href="https://paydayreport.com/ford-workers-walk-off-workplace-violence-at-record-levels-220-strikes-since-march-1st/">since March 1st</a>.  Most have received little press attention and all States have relaxed Stay-at-Home Orders.  </p>



<p>Finally on May 18th, the <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/safety/afl-cio-sues-osha-to-force-temporary-worker-safety-standard">AFL-CIO filed a lawsuit</a> to ask a federal court to compel the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to issue an emergency temporary standard to protect workers from the novel coronavirus. Sadly this is too late for many hundreds if not thousands of deceased essential workers and their families who became infected with COVID-19. The case is <a href="https://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/InreAmericanFederationofLaboraDocketNo2001158DCCirMay182020CourtD?1590201859">In re: American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations</a>, D.C. Cir., No. 19-1158, 5/18/20.</p>



<p>Follow the money. Seems immigrants and refugees, the poor and the middle class are expendable. All that matters is the 1% and wealthy corporations.  </p>



<p>We need a grassroots campaign to get America to protect workers’ health and our food supply!</p>

<p>宍戸・稲谷・若目田、三先生によるコメントが日経に出ていました。</p>







<p><a href="https://t.co/9DdCdWCcTR?amp=1"></a><a href="https://t.co/9DdCdWCcTR?amp=1">デジタル時代の法とは（複眼）デジタル技術の急速な発展が変えるのは、人々の生活や企業活動だけではない。各種の規制や法律のあり方、さらには刑事司法の仕組みまで見直さないと、コロナ危機対応を含めて、日本は世界的なイノベーション競争にnikkei.com</a></p>



<p>目的ベースに法を変化させるべきとのことなら大賛成です。</p>



<p>それはそれとして、記事中の若目田氏の発言にある『ビッグデータは「21世紀の石油」といわれる価値ある資源』という表現が気になって連続ツイートし、いまこのブログをまとめています。</p>



<p>この表現が日本で取り沙汰されるようになったのはダボス会議の主催者WEFの2011年1月のレポート、『パーソナル・データ：あらたな資産カテゴリの出現（Personal Data: The Emergence of a New Asset Class) 』あたりが始まりと思います。このレポートはいろいろな誤解を生んでいるレポートで、作成にあたってAcknowledgeされている３３人の一人として責任を感じています。</p>



<p>このレポートの冒頭に 「パーソナルデータはインターネットの新たなOILであり、デジタル世界のあらたな通貨である。（Personal data is the new oil of the Internet and thenew currency of the digital world.）」 という、当時のEUのConsumer ComiisionerであったMeglena Kuneva氏の2009年3月の発言がフィーチャーされていて、それに引き続き「それは、社会のあらゆる側面に影響を及ぼす新たな資産クラスとして出現するだろう。(It will emerge as a new asset class touching all aspects of society.)」とされています。</p>



<p>この置き方は大変キャッチーであり、人々をこのレポートに惹きつけるのに大きな力を発揮したと思います。しかし同時に、レポートをちゃんと読まない人には大きな誤解も生んだのではないかと思います。特に日本語においては。</p>



<p>というのは、冒頭の発言が、若目田氏が引用されているように「２１世紀の石油」というように翻訳・翻案されてしまったからです。わたしはこれは、「２１世紀の原油」と翻訳すべきであったと思っています。</p>



<p>なんとなれば、原油というのは、精製しなければ始末に負えない毒物・環境汚染物質で、扱いを間違えば爆発炎上、漏らせば生態系を破壊、ただし、きちんと精製して注意深く使えば大変な価値を生むものというニュアンスが伝わるのに、石油だと伝わらなくなってしまうからです。</p>



<p>このレポートが書かれていた2010年は、ちょうど<a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010%E5%B9%B4%E3%83%A1%E3%82%AD%E3%82%B7%E3%82%B3%E6%B9%BE%E5%8E%9F%E6%B2%B9%E6%B5%81%E5%87%BA%E4%BA%8B%E6%95%85">メキシコ湾原油流出事故</a>が起きていたときで、これにかこつけて、わたしたちはパーソナルデータについてそう説明していたのです。これをWEFのインタビューではなしたら、上記のKuneva氏の発言を編集者が引っ張ってきて配置した感じで、実はわたしはこのとき彼女のこの発言のことを知りませんでした。</p>



メキシコ湾原油流出事故(2010/4)の消火最中の写真。(Source) Wikimedia. Public Domain. 



<p>また、「資産」という表現も問題です。物権をイメージさせるからです。</p>



<p>実はこのレポートにはここ以外にはパーソナルデータを「資産 (asset)」という単語に結びつけている箇所は２箇所しかありません。そのうち１箇所は質問としてで、回答では価値 (value) という単語しか使っていません。というのは、わたしたちはこのレポートが作られる過程で、物権的ニュアンスをデータに対して読者が持つことを大変警戒して指摘していて、ドラフト段階で指摘していたからです。もう一箇所は、指摘漏れですねぇ。わかっている人の間で比喩的に揶揄的に使うのは問題ないのですけどね。たとえば、「あなたはFBの顧客ではなく、商品だ。」と言ったりするのは、皮肉を込めて物権的に表現しているわけで。でも、一般読者は多分額面通りに物権的にとってしまう。</p>



<p>というわけで、残念なところはあるのですが、全体を通して読んで貰えば、かなり良い、味わい深いレポートにはなっていると思うので、キャッチーなところだけ読んで理解した気になるのではなく、全体を読んでほしいと思うのです。各所に良いヒントが入っています。</p>



<p>たとえば、パーソナルデータの種類としてP.7には</p>



  自発的に提供されたデータ  観測されたデータ  推計されたデータ  



<p>があると書かれていたり、User Centric であったり、Personal Data Ecosystem や Trust Framework にガッツリページ数を割いていたりします。<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2020/05/4637/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-4637" title="日本で言う情報銀行なんかも、Perosnal Data Ecosystem を形成しようとしている Trust Framework の一種なんですよ。">1</a> こういうあたりは、結構時間を割いて、たしかIIW #10 (2010年5月)のサイド・ミーティングとかでScott Davidなどといっしょに、このプロジェクトの取りまとめをしていたJustin Rico Oyolaに説明した覚えがあります。<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2020/05/4637/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-4637" title="まぁ、わたしが説明しなくても、John KlippingerやScott David がSteering Boardに入ってたから当然こうなったとは思いますが。">2</a></p>



<p>ちなみに、このWEFのレポートを日本で一番最初の方に紹介したのがわたしのこのブログ記事 <a href="https://t.co/q0wMufq94D?amp=1">https://sakimura.org/2011/02/1036/</a>  です。さきほど見返していて、その中で、なんかえらくうまいこと言っているのに気がつきました。</p>



<p>これ、もとは、Scott David あたりかなぁ。<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2020/05/4637/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-4637" title="まぁひょっとすると、わたし自身かもしれませんが。時々無意識にうまいこと言うみたいなんで。7年くらい前に、OpenID Foundation の事務局長 (Executive Director) のDon Thibeau が、英国の内閣府でのミーティングで「パーソナルデータは毒性資産 (toxic asset)だ」と演説していて、「ずいぶんうまいこと言うね。」と褒めたら、「何いってんだ。あなたの言葉じゃないか。」と言われたことありますし…。">3</a><a href="https://t.co/q0wMufq94D?amp=1">曰く、</a></p>



<blockquote><p>電線に、電子を通すと電力産業になり、電子の波を通すと電話に、パケットを通すとインターネットになった。次は、「個人が産み出す情報（Personal Data）」を構造化したものを流すようになり新たな産業が生まれる。 これが Personal Data Ecosystemで、その根幹をなすのが信頼フレームワークである。</p>(Source)   <a href="https://t.co/q0wMufq94D?amp=1">https://sakimura.org/2011/02/1036/</a></blockquote>



<p>なお、この当時(2010 – 2011)のインタビューとか見返すと、関係者は、GoogleやFacebookがパーソナルデータを使って広告で収益を挙げているのの何割かはパーソナルデータを制御、個人の手に力を戻す方に振り向けられるようになると語られていたのですが、残念ながら全く実現していません。実に遺憾です。</p>



<p>それでも、少しづつでも進んでいくしか無いんですよね。おりしも #新型コロナ 問題で、国内個人情報保護法2000個問題の解決にすこし動き出してきたきらいがあります。この機を逃さず、進めていかなければ。</p><p>The post <a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2020/05/4637/">パーソナルデータは新しい時代の石油か？</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.sakimura.org/">@_Nat Zone</a>.</p>

<p>ごめんなさい。事後報告です。</p>



<p>今日の未明、OpenID FoundationのVirtual Workshop — 初めての試みでした — でスピーチをしました。アジェンダは以下に貼っておきます。そのうちビデオも公開されるはずです。</p>



<p>ものすごい駆け足な、各WGの紹介でしたが、相当面白かったです。日本から参加された方、朝の４時までお疲れさまでした。</p>



<p>一つ後悔していることがあって…。せっかくだから、みなでビデオをオンにして記念撮影すればよかったなと。次回は忘れないようにしようと思います。</p>



<p>しかし、先週はEIC、今週はこれ、来週はFDX会合、再来週はIdentiverseかな？日本にいながら完全に時差ボケというか、昼間は昼間で仕事してるし、まさに「24時間戦えますか？」です。え、古いですか？古いですよね。Japan as No.1 のころの「24時間戦えますか。ビジネスマーン〜ジャーパニーズ・ビジネスマーン」で有名になったリゲインの広告です。若い方々のためにバブル臭紛々たる広告を貼っておきますね。</p>



<p>このころは日本の一人あたりGDPはアメリカを抜いて実質世界一だったんですよ。勢いがありましたね。と、同時に、あぁ、まだ女性の本格的社会進出前だったんだなぁというのも。わたしが入った会社でも、女性の総合職の採用は1990年からですからね。それまでは、何年かいてお嫁に行くという価値観だった。あと、南国編で飛行機から降りてレイを首にかけてもらってほっぺたにキスって、多分本当にそういうサービスを空港かなんかがやってたんだよねぇ。アメリカでも。</p>



 

 



<p>もひとつ。当時の日本のサラリーマンのイメージを一番良く表しているのがこのバージョンかな。これが一番印章に残ってるかも。これ、ビル登ったりしてるけど、CG一切使ってないんですよね。すごいなー。まぁ、CG前夜だしか。</p>



 

 



<p>ちなみに、このCMのメイキング映像がこちら。すごく面白いので、ぜひご覧あれ。</p>

Photo Cred:&nbsp;Adobe<p><a href="https://www.transmute.industries/our-technology">Transmute</a> believes that cross-vendor interoperability is critical for commercialization of decentralized identifier (DID) and verifiable credential (VC) technology. To interoperate means that a computer system or software has the ability to exchange and make use of data from a different system or software “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interoperability#Software">via a common set of exchange formats</a>.” But technical interoperability is difficult to achieve, and it’s definitely not the status quo when it comes to the systems our customers are using today. In fact, most of them are [frustratingly] locked into a single vendor when it comes to transaction management software — with no easy way to share data with parties in their ecosystem.</p><p>I’m often asked why we, as a start-up, would <a href="https://gist.github.com/OR13/0b8be9d8c43c2acd2d7cf09f6887a8a0">build so much out in the open</a>. We aren’t afraid to put out the first reference implementation — although never without tests — because we’re keen to have a baseline to measure against and iterate on, especially when it comes to the technical foundations required for achieving interoperability. The more interesting question is why we work so hard to ensure interoperability with “competing” or ancillary DID-based products. The answer is that we view achieving interoperability as a requirement for market creation.</p><blockquote>We are solving a business problem; achieving interoperability is a barrier to adoption.</blockquote><p>As the world becomes increasingly hyperconnected, “connective tissue” products and services [like ride-shares, Slack, etc.] are in greater demand in order to bridge the last miles and information silos created between the multitude of disparate internet-enabled products and services we now rely on. For this product category, interoperability is required to create a market compelling enough to go&nbsp;after.</p><p>For instance, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/2/5/18210376/uber-lyft-ride-loyalty-chart">if you are loyal to a single ride-share brand today</a>, your user experience suffers. It takes longer to find rides if you’re loyal, and <a href="https://evestar.com/brand-loyalty-is-dead-for-electric-scooters/">transit time is a key metric in mobility</a>. Additionally, a frustrating user experience limits adoption, and throws a major kink in customer retention. If riders have multiple apps and are willing to ride whatever brand is most convenient to them, their user experience massively improves, adoption accelerates, and the market expands for everyone. This example demonstrates market expansion due to interchangeability versus technical interoperability, but it highlights the same impact to customer adoption and retention given customers’ current attitude toward avoiding vendor&nbsp;lock-in.</p><p>Similarly, if my Texas issued digital driver license can’t be verified by my California-resident digital wallet, then I have not sufficiently solved the inefficiencies and traceability problems of physical licenses. In this scenario, a new, worse inconvenience is created since adoption of a solution that lacks interoperability means I’ll have to carry my physical license for interstate transit and my digital one. Furthermore, convincing state DMVs to offer a digital identity credential is a tremendous feat (<a href="https://thedailytexan.com/2019/04/18/digital-driver%E2%80%99s-license-test-program-approved-by-texas-house">it took Texas 3 legislative sessions to agree to a single pilot</a>); imagine when you have to sell them on implementing 50 different versions. After all, my physical form Texas drivers license is already an acceptable identification credential across all 50&nbsp;states.</p><p>One criticism of supply chain-focused solutions using blockchain is that in order to realize value, you have to convince all of the ecosystem players to adopt the same product — or at least the same technology stack. Not only is that a tough sell in terms of architecture investment (nobody wants to “rip-and-replace,” and everybody hates vendor lock-in), but it does not sufficiently address the data sharing challenges that logistics professionals face today. Efficiency gains are necessary, but not sufficient; customers want to share critical data in a provable form regardless of the underlying system.</p><blockquote>If a brand uses software to create digital product credentials, but said credentials could not be effectively handed off to subsequent players in their supply chain, then the problem isn’t&nbsp;solved.</blockquote><p>For Transmute, the foundations required to technically interoperate are considered pre-competitive, and our ability to interoperate widely is a strategic feature. This feature powers a competitive advantage that ensures Transmute customers’ critical trade documents are verifiable at every step in the supply chain, regardless of where they’re stored and what blockchain they’re anchored to. <a href="https://www.transmute.industries/global-trade-solutions">Transmute customers</a> realize maximum confidence about data integrity and access far richer insights about the health of their supply chains as a&nbsp;result.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/the-business-case-for-interoperability-a1a2b884297d">The Business Case for Interoperability</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk">Transmute</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

You can find full series on my Medium profile; <a href="https://medium.com/@arjgovind/self-sovereign-identity-under-the-hood-b987123c25ba">here is a link</a> to the next&nbsp;article.</p><p>That being said, I think you raise some interesting questions here; let me briefly address&nbsp;them.</p>  Regarding multiple identities, yes, anyone is free to make as many identities (i.e. DIDs) as they please. However, the trust in a DID stems from the credentials it’s been issued, and a credential issuer (say the government) is not going to issue multiple credentials based on my one physical identity.  The “link” between physical and digital identities is established primarily by verifiable credentials. To get the government to issue you a driver’s license credential, they ultimately verify your real physical ID (and make sure you can drive!). Similarly, a credential from a university will involve the university checking that you studied&nbsp;there.  I think the legal status of DIDs and digital contracts is a complicated question, however I do explore some legal questions in my <a href="https://medium.com/inside-r3/is-self-sovereign-identity-the-answer-to-gdpr-compliance-15c289ac3c27">article on GDPR</a> and a forthcoming piece on&nbsp;KYC.  <p>Thanks again for&nbsp;writing!</p>

  <p>A report I have co-authored on <a href="http://sammantics.com/s/DAO-A-Decentralized-Governance-Layer-for-the-Internet-of-Value-1.pdf">DAOs can be downloaded here</a>.</p> KEY TAKE-AWAYS <p></p>  <p>The key feature that changed organizations over the years has been: reducing transaction costs to coordinate. This is reflected in Coase’s Theory of the Firm. You can achieve marginal improvements, such as applying decision support systems within an organization, but every once in a while, a large systemic change occurs that at first looks like a marginal benefit, but in essence enables wholly new types of organizations to exist.&nbsp;</p>  <p>DAOs not only allow for the reduction of transaction costs, but new organizational forms and compositions to be created.</p>  <p>In order to have a highly functional DAO, members must:</p>  <p>Have equal access to the same information for decision-making</p>  <p>Face the same costs for transacting their preferred choices</p>  <p>Base their decisions on self-interest and the best interest of the DAO (not on coercion or fear)</p>    <p>DAOs attempt to solve coordination problems by solving problems associated with collective actions by aligning individual incentives with globally optimal outcomes (for people or corporations). By pooling funds and voting on fund allocation, stakeholders share the costs and incentivize coordination so the entire ecosystem benefits.</p>  <p>DAOs are performing the biggest experiment in new forms of alternative governance. These experiments are not in the form of giant nation-states but applied on a local community level. This comes at a time where peak globalization is in the rear-view window and the world is retreating to a more local model.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>It is important to note, Bitcoin was the first DAO.&nbsp; It is run without a central authority by a core team of developers who propose decisions on the future direction of the project, mainly through Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) which need consensus from all network participants (though mainly miners and exchanges) for changes in the code to be made.</p>  <p>There will be a growing number of DSaaS (DAO Software as a Service)&nbsp; providers, such as OpenLaw, Aragon and DAOstack,&nbsp; designed to accelerate the growth of DAOs as a category. They will provide on-demand specialized resources such as legal, accounting, and third party auditing for compliance services.</p>  <p>In a DAO a triangle of tensions exists.&nbsp; This lexicon of the triangle is based on the treatise “Exit, Voice &amp; Loyalty” by Albert Hirschman. These must be balanced to find an optimal outcome which allows the DAO to achieve its mandate:</p>  <p>Exit (Individual)</p>  <p>Voice (Governance)</p>  <p>Loyalty (Decentralization)</p>    <p>DAOs challenge the traditional hierarchical and exclusive organizational structure as seen in many facets of the world today. Through “wisdom of the crowds” it is possible to have better collective decision making and therefore better run organizations.</p>  <p>New products are being made at the intersection of DAOs and Decentralized Finance (DeFi). As DAOs become more decentralized and digitized using DeFi products as the payment/distribution methods, DAOs will increase and lead to new and more DeFi products being formed to interact with DAOs. This will be most powerful where the DeFi implementations allow token holders to use governance to customize and optimize the design of the parameters of the application creating a better, tailored user-experience. It can also be used for time locking and creating different types of fee structures.</p>  <p>DAOs allow for capital to be pooled, that pooled capital to be allocated, and to create an asset backed by that capital. They also allow for non-financial resource allocation.</p>  <p>Using DeFi enables DAOs to bypass, if they choose, the traditional banking sector, along with their inefficiencies.&nbsp; This is significant as it creates a Trustless, Borderless, Transparent, Accessible, Interoperable &amp; Composable corporation.</p>  <p>DAO community and governance is very complex and difficult to get right, yet is crucial to the success of the DAO.&nbsp; Coordination processes and incentive measures need to be balanced so that all community members feel that their contributions matter.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Most DAOs are looking to wrap a legal structure with underlying smart contract code around the entity so as to comply with regulations, provide legal protection and limited liability to their participants and allow for easier deployment of capital.</p>  <p>DAO is a Misnomer. DAOs today are not fully decentralized, nor are they fully autonomous and in some cases they may never aspire to be either. Most DAOs will start centralized, then start adopting smart contracts to automate simple internal processes and limit centralized governance. With an aligned purpose, good design and luck they can grow towards being a truer version of a DAO in time. This misnomer has led to a lot of hype around the distributed autonomy of DAOs versus the reality of what they are today.</p>  <p>DAOs are not radical or unique to blockchain technology. There is a long history of DAOs to improve governance structures, decentralized decision making, improve and enforce transparency and enable membership voting and active participation in decision making.</p>  <p>DAO participation currently targets a niche within a niche within a niche. Many DAOs require a minimum staking for participation in a cryptocurrency. This limits participation to the crypto participants who are wealthy, tech savvy enough and interested enough to participate in a DAO.&nbsp; </p>  <p></p><p></p>

<p>On May 7th just over a week ago, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/07/melinda-gates-coronavirus-trump-d-243695">Melinda Gates gave</a> the Trump administration a D- for how they have handled the outbreak. </p>



<p>She cited the lack of a coordinated, national response. Saying the governors were stepping up with “50 different homegrown state solutions,” instead of a national response. </p>



<p>On March 29th, Karen and Kaliya rated the federal government’s performance a D-, quoting our post we scored the US performance against four metrics that medical and public health providers outlined: </p>



 We decided to grade the US performance so far against the four main performance metrics and detailed strategies/tactics that the medical and legal experts laid out earlier this month –and — the grades are not good:&nbsp; 



 Adequate Funding and Support for the Response must be Provided. =&nbsp;Grade C- 



 Surging Healthcare demand must be Managed and Patients and Healthcare Workers Protected.&nbsp;=&nbsp;Grade D- 



 Clear, Evidence-Based Communication is Critical to Manage Public Fear.&nbsp; =&nbsp;Grade F 



 Support and Resources Must be Provided for Fair and Effective Infection Control.&nbsp; =&nbsp;Grade C and TBD 



<p>We used as the basis of our judgement a <a href="https://law.yale.edu/sites/default/files/area/center/ghjp/documents/final_covid-19_letter_from_public_health_and_legal_experts.pdf">March 3rd letter from public health and legal experts</a>. </p>



<blockquote><p>“We write as experts in public health, law, and human rights, with experience in previous pandemic responses, set forth principles and practices that should guide the efforts against COVID-19 in the US.&nbsp;It is essential that all institutions, public and private, address the following critical concerns through new legislation, institutional policies, leadership and spending.”</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>“The COVID-19 outbreak is&nbsp;unprecedented&nbsp;in recent American history, and there is no playbook for an epidemiological event of this scope and magnitude. To mitigate its impact, you must&nbsp;act swiftly, fairly, and effectively. We urge you to&nbsp;take these recommendations seriously and act urgently so that we are best protected from the damage of this unprecedented microbial threat and the possible harms of an uninformed or poorly conceived response.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Hop over to our March 29th post to see our <a href="https://letshaveaplan.blog/2020/03/29/failing-grades-for-us-response-in-covid19-crisis/">detailed analysis from that date</a>. </p>

<p>​On April 20th two different headlines in the Seattle Times illustrate this widening wealth divide: (1) <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/rich-americans-activate-new-zealand-pandemic-escape-plans/?utm_source=marketingcloud&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Morning+Brief+4-21-20_4_21_2020&amp;utm_term=">Rich Americans activate New Zealand pandemic escape plans</a> and (2) <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/homeless/first-homeless-coronavirus-death-announced-in-king-county-as-cases-skyrocket-among-shelter-populations/">Coronavirus cases skyrocket among homeless shelter population in King County</a>, death reported at quarantine facility</p>



<p>I continue to hope that the residents in King County, Washington will wake up and set aside their intellect and work together to stand up to the corporate oppression of poor and low-income people and people of color. A few <a href="https://www.king5.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/some-may-day-protests-to-go-on-with-social-distancing-guidelines/281-28eb52ee-eb1c-4102-a1f1-87bd9641eb07">protested in Olympia on May 1</a> and joined with the national rent/mortgage strikes nationally. A <a href="https://popularresistance.org/generalstrike2020-how-to-participate/">General Strike is set to occur on June 1.</a>&nbsp; </p>



<p>As Seattle Mayor Durkin reminded me in a interview she gave, <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/coronavirus-daily-news-updates-march-25-what-to-know-today-about-covid-19-in-the-seattle-area-washington-state-and-the-nation/">“Hope is not an action.”</a> I thought that line sounded a bit strange, but the more I thought about it, the more it really resonates with me, “Hope is not an action.” </p>



<p>An article about the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190218-are-we-on-the-road-to-civilisation-collapse">increasing likelihood of civilization’s collapse</a> was written a year before the vicious COVID-19 disease surfaced. Several causes were identified: climate change, environmental degradation, inequality and oligarchy, complexity, external shocks and randomness/bad luck.  One of them, Inequality and Oligarchy, defined inequality as: “wealth and political inequality.” They can be central drivers of social disintegration, as <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Radical_Transformation.html?id=x3VZDwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=kp_read_button&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">can oligarchy and centralisation of power</a> among leaders. </p>



<p>The wealth divide in King County is huge. The two richest men in the world reside in King County. The poverty rate is 9.7% (<a href="https://www.kingcounty.gov/depts/executive/performance-strategy-budget/regional-planning/benchmark-program/Economy/EC03_Poverty.aspx">24.7% of the African American community live below the poverty line</a>.</p>



<blockquote><p>This not only causes social distress, but handicaps a society’s ability to respond to ecological, social and economic problems.</p><p>The field of cliodynamics models how factors such as equality and demography correlate with political violence. Statistical analysis of previous societies suggests that this <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/human-cycles-history-as-science-1.11078">happens in cycles</a>. As population increases, the supply of labour outstrips demand, workers become cheap and society becomes top-heavy. This inequality undermines collective solidarity and political turbulence follows.</p>BBC Future: Are we on the road to civilisation collapse? February 18, 2019</blockquote>







<p>We have been in quarantine for nearly 7 weeks. (<a href="https://www.governor.wa.gov/news-media/inslee-announces-stay-home-stay-healthy%C2%A0order">Stay Home, Stay Healthy WA March 23 Order</a>). </p>



<p>49 states are in various stages of reopening, even though none have met the original CDC guidance of 14 days of declining infections and <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Guidelines-for-Opening-Up-America-Again.pdf">14 days of death declines</a>.  We need people to stay home to stop the spread. We need politicians to stop “forcing” people to return to work UNTIL the employer has a written plan approved by the local public health officer and full testing and tracing capability exists for all workers. To-date front-line workers have been going to work and their employers are not providing adequate safety policies and PPE. These employees are endangering their lives, we need to provide Americans basic re-occurring income to meet their immediate needs in this time of public health and economic crisis. Tyson plants have been <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-28/trump-says-he-s-issuing-order-for-tyson-s-unique-liability">ordered to stay open</a> by presidential orders. </p>



<p>Basic income, also called universal basic income (UBI), citizen’s income, citizen’s basic income, basic income guarantee, basic living stipend or guaranteed annual income is a governmental public program for a periodic payment delivered to all on an individual basis without means test or work …</p>



<p>Sad for me to witness King County friends, allies and  residents that I know not supporting essential workers locally, and remaining silent while the worst offender, Amazon, headquartered in our community oppresses and endangers the lives of its warehouse workers.  Comrades on<a href="https://nypost.com/2020/03/30/coronavirus-in-ny-amazons-staten-island-employees-strike-over-response/"> Staten Island</a> and in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/07/08/amazon-workers-plan-strike-during-prime-day-sale-over-working-conditions/">Minnesota</a> have risked their livelihoods striking Amazon’s warehouses to shine a light on their unjust treatment of low wage workers. <a href="https://apnews.com/6f4683dd23c02ea2e2b3bec81fd59926"> France has acted</a> and regulated Amazon’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/4/1/21201162/amazon-delivery-delays-coronavirus-worker-strikes">poor treatment of its workers</a>. Not Washington State. Not King County. Guess there is just too much wealth here to comprehend and or care about the role of society to care about the well being of poor and low income people beyond occasional charitable donations??&nbsp;</p>



<p>Amazon’s own occasional donations (<a href="https://blog.aboutamazon.com/community/laptops-donated-and-online-resources-provided-to-thousands-of-ap-computer-science-students">computers for Seattle low income students after</a> a month of inability to learn online) seem to provide the multi-billion dollar corporation and its CEO, the wealthiest man in the world, Jeff Bezos, social justice “permission” to not need to protect its essential low income workers who cannot work from home with PPE, social distancing and paid sick leave. Lest us not forget that the Amazon corporation pays no income tax and contributes zero to our WA State safety net.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Within the last four weeks during this pandemic, Jeff Bezos bought a<a href="https://people.com/home/jeff-bezos-buys-house-david-geffen-los-angeles-beverly-hills-165-million/"> home in CA</a> and one <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/jeff-bezos-buys-another-new-york-city-condo-report-2020-4?op=1">in NYC</a>. </p>



<p>Wouldn’t it be wonderful if instead of buying yet another residence to sit vacant for months each year, Bezos instead invested that $40 million on the safety of his front-line employees who are paid minimum wage and who he is actively trying to <a href="https://gizmodo.com/amazons-aggressive-anti-union-tactics-revealed-in-leake-1829305201">prevent from organizing</a> to <a href="https://www.thestranger.com/slog/2020/04/02/43318903/amazon-executive-who-conspired-to-smear-warehouse-protester-held-fundraiser-for-biden-in-seattle">unionize</a>.   And now Bezos  is on track to be the  <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/jeff-bezos-on-track-to-become-trillionaire-by-2026-2020-5">world’s first trillionaire</a>. Ugh.  Why does money have to be hoarded this way by individuals? Last time I checked, people needed people to survive. </p>



<p>The window is closing to advance systemic change.  Let’s Have a Plan. </p>

<p>Note: This is an edited excerpt from the upcoming release of the Public Sector Profile of the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework Version&nbsp;1.1</p> Digital Ecosystem Roles <p>The digital ecosystem roles are carried out by many different entities that perform specific roles under a variety of labels. Given the variety of business, service, and technology models that exist within the digital ecosystem, roles may be performed by multiple different actors in a given context, or one actor may perform several roles (e.g., be a relying party as well as a credential provider).</p><p>The model consists of four&nbsp;roles:</p>  Subject: An entity about which Claims are asserted by an&nbsp;Issuer.  Issuer: An entity that asserts one or more Claims about one or more Subjects, creates a Credential from these Claims, and assigns the Credential to a&nbsp;Holder.  Holder: An entity that controls one or more Credentials from which a<br>Presentation can be expressed to a Verifier. A Holder is usually, but not always, the Subject of a Credential  Verifier: An entity that accepts a Presentation from a Holder for the purposes of delivering services or administering programs.   Digital Ecosystem Information Flows <p>The model also consists of five information flows:</p><p>1. Claim: A statement about a&nbsp;Subject.</p><p>2. Credential: A set of one or more Claims asserted about one or more Subjects&nbsp;.</p><p>3. Presentation: Information derived from one or more Credentials. The data in a Presentation is often about the same Subject, but the Credentials might have been issued by different Issuers.</p><p>4. Credential Registration: An indication of the existence of a credential.</p><p>5. Correctness Confirmation: An indication of the correctness of the Presentation itself and the correctness of the information associated with the Presentation.</p> Methods <p>Methods encompass the sets of rules that govern such things as data models, communications protocols, cryptographic algorithms, distributed ledgers, databases, and similar schemes; and combinations of these. Methods also include systems that are isolated or have intermittent connectivity. Within the context of the digital ecosystem, Methods enable actors to interact directly or indirectly with one another without either party being bound to a particular solution or technology.</p> Entities (not shown in&nbsp;diagram) <p>Entities are defined as things with a distinct and independent existence such as a person, organization or device that can be subject to legislation, policy, or regulations within a context, and which may have certain rights, duties, and obligations. An entity can perform one or more roles in the digital ecosystem.</p>

<p>This week we published updates to two IETF specifications that support the WebAuthn/FIDO2 ecosystem, as well as other uses, such as decentralized identity.</p>
<p>One is COSE and JOSE Registrations for WebAuthn Algorithms.  It registers algorithm and elliptic curve identifiers for algorithms used by WebAuthn and FIDO2.  The “<code>secp256k1</code>” curve being registered is also used for signing in some decentralized identity applications.  The specification has completed the Area Director review and has been submitted to the IESG for publication.</p>
<p>The other is Registries for Web Authentication (WebAuthn).  This creates IANA registries enabling multiple kinds of extensions to W3C Web Authentication (WebAuthn) implementations to be registered.  This specification has completed IETF last call and is scheduled for review by the IESG.</p>
<p>Thanks to the COSE working group for their adoption of the algorithms specification, and to Ivaylo Petrov and Murray Kucherawy for their reviews of it.  Thanks to Kathleen Moriarty and Benjamin Kaduk for their Area Director sponsorships of the registries specification and to Jeff Hodges for being primary author of it.</p>
<p>The specifications are available at:</p>

I'm very proud of the topics we've decided to cover, of which there
are quite a few good ones in <a href="https://librelounge.org/archive/">the archive</a>,
and the audience the show has had is just the best.</p>
<p>However, I've decided to depart the show...  Serge and I continue to be
friends (and are still working on a number of projects together, such as
<a href="https://datashards.net/">Datashards</a> and the
<a href="https://dustycloud.org/blog/spritely-nlnet-grant/">recently announced grant</a>),
but in terms of the podcast I think we'd like to take things in
different creative directions.</p>
<p>This is probably not the end of me doing podcasting, but if I start
something up again it'll be a bit different in its structure... and
you can be sure you'll hear about it here and on my
<a href="https://octodon.social/@cwebber/">fediverse account</a> and over at
<a href="https://twitter.com/dustyweb/">the birdsite</a>.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, I look forward to continuing to tuning into Libre

   I've been putting off making this blogpost for a while because I kept

<p>I've been putting off making this blogpost for a while because I kept
thinking, "I should wait to do it until I finish making some sort of
website for <a href="https://dustycloud.org/blog/spritely/">Spritely</a> and make
a blogpost there!"
Which, in a sense is a completely reasonable thought because right now
Spritely's only "website" is a
<a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely">loose collection of repositories</a>,
but I'd like something that provides a greater narrative for what
Spritely is trying to accomplish.
But that also kind of feels like a distraction (or maybe I should just
make a very minimal website) when there's something important to
announce... so I'm just doing it here (where I've been making all the
other Spritely posts so far anyway).</p>
<p>Spritely is an <a href="https://nlnet.nl/">NLnet</a> (in conjunction with the
European Commision / Next Generation Internet initative) grant
recipient!
Specifically, we have received a grant for "Interface Discovery for
Distributed Systems"!
I'll be implementing the work alongside Serge Wroclawski.</p>
<p>There are two interesting sub-phrases there: "Interface Discovery"
and "Distributed Systems".
Regarding "distributed systems", we should really say "mutually
suspicious open-world distributed systems".
Those extra words change some of the requirements; we have to assume
we'll be told about things we don't understand, and we have to assume
that many objects we interact with may be opaque to us... they might
lie about what kind of thing they are.</p>
<p>Choosing how to name interfaces then directly ties into something I
wrote about here more recently, namely
<a href="https://dustycloud.org/blog/content-addressed-vocabulary/">content addressed vocabulary</a>.</p>
<p>I wrote more ideas and details about the interfaces ideas
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/cap-talk/YBF3QMKgvXs">email to cap-talk</a>
so you can read more there if you like... but I think more details
about the interfaces thoughts than that can wait until we publish
a report about it (and publishing a report is baked into the grant).</p>
<p>The other interesting bit though is the "distributed" aspect; in order
to handle distributed computation and object interaction, we need to
correctly design our protocols.
Thankfully there is a lot of good prior art to work from, usually some
variant of "<a href="http://www.erights.org/elib/distrib/captp/index.html">CapTP</a>"
(Capability Transport Protocol), as implemented in its original form by
<a href="http://www.erights.org/">E</a>, taking on a bit of a different form in
the <a href="http://waterken.sourceforge.net/">Waterken</a> project, adapted in
<a href="https://capnproto.org/">Cap'N Proto</a>,
as well as with the new work happening over at <a href="https://agoric.com/">Agoric</a>.
Each of these variants of the core CapTP ideas have tried to tackle some
different use cases, and <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/goblins/index.html">Goblins</a>
has its own needs to be covered.
Is there a possibility of convergence?
Possibly... I am trying to understand the work of and communicate with
the folks over at Agoric but I think it's a bit too early to be
conclusive about anything.
Regardless, it'll be a major milestone once Spritely Goblins is able
to actually live up to its promise of distributed computation, and work
on this is basically the next step to proceed on.</p>
<p>When I first <a href="https://dustycloud.org/blog/spritely/">announced Spritely</a>
about a year and a half ago I included a section that said
"Who's going to pay for all this?" to which I then said,
"I don't really have a funding plan, so I guess this is kind of a
non-answer. However, I do have a
<a href="https://www.patreon.com/cwebber">Patreon account</a> you could donate to."
To be honest, I was fairly nervous about it... so I want to express my
sincere and direct appreciation to <a href="https://nlnet.nl/">NLnet</a> alongside
the European Commission / Next Generation Internet Initiative, along with
<a href="https://samsungnext.com/whats-next/category/podcasts/decentralization-samsung-next-stack-zero-grant-recipients/">Samsung Stack Zero</a>,
and all the folks donating on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/cwebber">Patreon</a>
and <a href="https://liberapay.com/cwebber/">Liberapay</a>.
With all the above, and especially the new grant from NLnet, I
should have enough funding to continue working on Spritely through
a large portion of 2021.
I am determined to make good on the support I've received, and am
looking forward to put out more interesting demonstrations of this
technology over the next few months.</p>

This report has been prepared on a best-effort basis for the IMSC Meeting on held May 11th, 2020, and may not accurately reflect, or be considered as any official position. Further, this Medium post has been edited to remove specific references and links to drafts which are still being reviewed by the PCTF Working Group.

The PSP is technology agnostic — we’ve ensured that we can incorporate both the emerging and legacy technologies.  The PCTF is not intended to impose technical architectures, but rather the PCTF sets expectations with the necessary transparency and due diligence such that we rely or trust on each others’ digital identities (irrespective of the technology implementation.)   Key Dates, Statistics and&nbsp;Links <p>Reflects the significant input and effort by the public&nbsp;sector.</p>  Public Sector Profile of the&nbsp;PCTF  Latest working group version of PSP PCTF (May 8th) (not yet posted on&nbsp;GitHub)  (Publicly available material is posted: <a href="https://canada-ca.github.io/PCTF-CCP/">https://canada-ca.github.io/PCTF-CCP/</a> )  Available under open government license  PCTF Working Group Engagement (Weekly meeting records are available)  114 members on the distribution list (includes Digital&nbsp;Nations)  Weekly call frequency (9 calls&nbsp;YTD)  Regular attendance by 10 FPTM jurisdictions  Federal counting as one (9 depts, agencies, incl OPC,&nbsp;BoC)  Weekly participation 20–28 members (based on last 7&nbsp;calls)  <p>Recent Milestones</p><p>May 8, 2020 PSP PCTF Version 1.1 DocVer 0.3 Consultation Draft (not yet on&nbsp;GitHub)</p>  180 WG comments received and disposed from the Feb 20th&nbsp;version  In addition to feedback — keeping the content&nbsp;fresh  Integrate the various traditional roles  Digital ecosystem roles, verifiable credentials, emerging standards  Feb 20th, 2020 PSP PCTF Version 1.1 Doc Ver&nbsp;0.3  129 WG comments from received and disposed from the October 31st&nbsp;version  Incorporating findings from thematic&nbsp;issues.  <p>Oct 31, 2019 PSP PCTF Version 1.1 Doc Ver 0.2 <a href="https://github.com/canada-ca/PCTF-CCP/tree/master/Version1_1">Consultation Draft</a> on&nbsp;GitHub</p>  Began to address thematic issues: related: to i) integration of Organizations and Persons, ii) Evolving state of credentials, iii) Notice and&nbsp;Consent  <p>July 4, 2019 PCTF Version 1.0 Recommendation Draft published on&nbsp;GitHub</p>  83 comments from received and disposed from the May 30th&nbsp;Version  <p>May 30, 2019 PCTF Version 1.0 Consultation Draft</p>  Based on feedback from IMSC In-Person meeting in&nbsp;Feb  <p>Assessment Worksheet</p>  29 atomic processes to&nbsp;date  Over 300 conformance criteria cross-referenced from current version PCTF-V1.1, PCTF-V1.0, PCTF-Alpha, TFEC  Various worksheets to assist in the assessment processes.  <p>Application of the PCTF to the assessment process of AB and BC — caused us to refactor (streamline) the trust framework. The PSP framework is now one framework document and one assessment worksheet. This was driven by the lessons learned in applying the framework and revisiting the overall structure of component deliverables having many redundant/repetitive sections that were difficult to maintain consistency.</p><p>In creating PSP PCTF Version 1.1, significant effort has been made to integrate the concepts of Verified Person and Verified Organization into a unified model of Trusted Digital Representations. What were previously separate components have been integrated into a more holistic model&nbsp;of:</p>  Normative Core the components that would comprise a standard that is national or international in&nbsp;scope.  Mutual Recognition — steps required to formalize an assessment or mutual recognition process.  Supporting Infrastructure — how the PCTF relates to other existing components and processes that support but are not necessarily the essence of the&nbsp;PCTF  Digital Ecosystem Roles and Information Flows — a section describing the emerging area relating to new conceptual approaches involving decentralized identity and verifiable credentials. It is anticipated that the PCTF will be applied in conjunction with these new technologies.   Next Steps   Finalize Version 1.1 of the PCTF — so that it is sufficient to conduct assessments of digital FPTM identity programs.  Continue integration of organizations. Continue the integration of organizations into the&nbsp;PCTF.  Continue assessments to evolve an assessment program: Use the PCTF V1.1 deliverables for assessment, incorporate lessons-learned, and continued integration.  Continue the development of the PCTF — refining the framework and evolving it to the more general use cases around digital&nbsp;trust.

  <p>Summary: Creating a network of networks, where multiple ledgers serve as anchors for credential definitions, has consequences for the overall system's ability to resist censorship. This post explores why.</p>

<a></a>
<p> 
    <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/12/verifiable_credential_exchange.shtml">SSI credentials</a> are <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/03/the_sovrin_ssi_stack.shtml">anchored on a distributed ledger</a>. Sovrin Network is based on Hyperledger Indy. In Indy, the credential definition, a <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/02/decentralized_identifiers.shtml">public DID</a>, schema, and revocation registry are all stored on the ledger1. 
</p>

<p>
    On a purely technical level, because of how credential proofs and DID resolution works, it doesn't really matter which ledger these artifacts are anchored on since if I prove something to you from a credential I hold, then you can use the information in the credential proof to find its definition, schema, the DID of the issuer, and so on. Regardless of where the credential is anchored, the verifier can get everything they need to cryptographically determine the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/10/fidelity_provenance_and_trust.shtml">fidelity of the credential</a>.
</p>

<p>
    But, knowing whether to trust the issuer of the credential and the ledger the credential is anchored on is more difficult. This is a matter of <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/10/fidelity_provenance_and_trust.shtml">provenance</a> and is more about governance than the technical features of the protocols and software.   
</p>

<p>
    As a result, we can imagine a world where many ledgers serve as anchors for the credential definitions and the other artifacts necessary for credential exchange to be trusted. In Sovrin, this idea is called "Network of Networks" and it has many proponents. We might have questions about which of those ledgers to trust, but that's the subject of a different post and I think the answer lies in governance frameworks. The issue I want to address in this post is what is the impact of Network of Networks architecture on censorship resistance. 
</p>

 Censorship 

<p>
    Censorship is the ability of one party to stop another from "speaking." I put that in quotes because I'm using the term "speak" in a very general sense. Speaking, on the Internet, is any activity which results in a packet being transmitted from one machine to another on someone's behalf.  So, sending an email is speaking, but so is a simple ping, or even a ACK in a <a href="https://www.guru99.com/tcp-3-way-handshake.html">TCP three-way handshake</a>. 
</p>

<p>
    In the world of credential exchange, you can censor issuers by restricting who can get a DID or write a credential definition. This is why supporting public writes is important. But you can also censor them by not allowing credential holders and verifiers to see the definitions they've written2.
</p>

<p>
    I have found that when people talk about censorship resistance, the discussion often rests on the decentralized nature of distributed ledgers. This happens because decentralization offers good protection against some censoring activities, along with other benefits for adoption and incentives. For censorship, decentralization can remove intermediaries. In any system with intermediaries, the intermediary can censor anyone connecting through them. 
</p>

<p>
    A decentralized architecture reduces dependence on someone else to speak, and so is more resistant to censorship. Decentralization can also help with censorship by ensuring access to the ledger and that <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/07/answering_questions_about_self-sovereign_identity.shtml">no single entity can disrupt the validation of new entries on the ledger</a>.  But decentralization alone isn't enough to create a network that resists censorship. Censorship resistance depends on how the decentralization is employed.
</p>

<p>
    For an example of why this is so, let's talk for a minute about another feature that distributed ledgers are made to solve, the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-spending">double spend problem</a> where a digital token is used more than once. Paradoxically, the way ledgers solve the double spend problem is to create a single ledger that everyone agrees on through eventual consistency. So, the users and validators on the ledger may be decentralized, but they are relying on a single, centralized artifact, the ledger.
</p>

 A Network of Networks 
<p>
    I spoke of the network of networks model above. To understand that better, let's look at the Sovrin SSI Stack. This figure is modified from one's I've <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/03/the_sovrin_ssi_stack.shtml">shared before</a> in that layer one contains more than one DID directory (my name for the combination of a DID method and a DID repository like a ledger). 
</p>


   <a></a>
	 The Sovrin SSI Stack (click to enlarge)


<p>
    As I've said, the nature of DID resolution lets any agent at layer two resolve a DID, regardless of which DID Directory it is stored in. A Sovrin agent, based on <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/aries">Hyperledger Aries</a> also uses the DID directory to discover credential definitions, schema, and revocation registries. Ideally, these DID directories are public utilities that are, at least, readable by anyone. 
</p>

<p>
    Anyone can use the <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/hyperledger-indy">open-source Indy code</a> to create a fully functional DID directory. And people will, for reasons good and bad. As a consequence, there is not a single, shared ledger where credentials and public DIDs are anchored, but many.
</p>

 Consequences 

<p>
    If we filter this all through the lens of decentralization as an unalloyed good, then a network of networks seems like a wonderful idea. The logic is inescapable: more networks == more decentralization == more good. But a network of networks has consequences for censorship resistance that we may not like. 
</p>

<p>
    Suppose the country of <a href="https://designated-survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Naruba">Naruba</a> decides that they need their own DID directory to feel comfortable that citizen's credentials are anchored in a ledger with validator nodes that are trusted entities inside the country. There's an element of trust here and different governments and organizations will have their own trust criteria.
</p>

<p>
    Within a proper governance framework, Naruba's DID directory could be <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/10/fidelity_provenance_and_trust.shtml">known to be trustworthy by other international players (a property I call "provenance")</a>. Sovrin Foundation has plans to extend the <a href="https://sovrin.org/library/sovrin-governance-framework/">Sovrin Governance Framework</a> to support a network of networks model and provide the rules for establishing the provenance of DID directories functioning within the Sovrin ecosystem.
</p>

<p>
    Now, imagine you're a business based in Naruba, anchoring credentials on the Naruba DID directory. Your credentials will be trusted within Naruba because the government has set up governance for the Naruba DID directory and told Narubians to trust it. Your credentials might be trusted outside of Naruba if the Naruba DID directory is operating within some governance framework that organizations outside Naruba trust. So far, so good. 
</p>

<p>
    The <a href="https://designated-survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Kunami">Emirate of Kunami</a> and Naruba are not on friendly terms. In an effort to punish Narubian businesses and keep them from buying Kumani oil, the Emir declares that the Narubian DID directory is off limits and the country carefully blocks the nodes on the Narubian ledger so that it is not accessible from Kunami. As a result, Narubian oil refineries can no longer do business with Kumani oil suppliers. Because the entire world economy depends on SSI and verifiable credentials, this is devastating because there are no other mechanisms to validate the complex supply chain transactions. 
</p>

<p>
    Now imagine a different scenario where there's one, predominant ledger where credential definitions are anchored. In this world, when Kunami wants to block Narubian credentials, blocking access to the DID directory would also block credentials their own economy depends on. So, they're forced to try to attack credentials one-by-one. A single, trusted anchor for credential definitions protects everyone from censorship. If any actor can isolate their core credential definitions on a network that they control, they can censor other networks without too much impact on themselves. Large, mixed pools of credential definitions provide a sort of herd immunity for everyone against censorship. 
</p>

<p>
    Of course, you can't stop someone from standing up their own network and, in the case of a government, forcing their citizens to use it. But if businesses and agencies inside the country need to interact with others outside the country, they may need to anchor credentials off that nationalized ledger to do business and then they can't censor. So, whether or not the Kunami DID directory would facilitate censorship depends on whether or not the international community would recognize it as a trustworthy source. If others don't trust it, Kumani can't use it as a weapon.
</p>

 Network of Networks Governance 

<p>
    Don't get me wrong. I understand the drive to create a DID directory controlled by a government or industry organization. And some of those reasons form the basis for gaining traction and getting the adoption necessary for SSI to become a dominant means of <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2017/01/a_universal_trust_framework.shtml">creating trustworthy connection on the Internet</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Consequently, Sovrin supports a Network of Networks model. Right now adoption is the most important thing. Over time, multiple DID directories will likely coalesce into a few large directories. In the meantime, shared governance and community activity will compensate for the danger of censorship that multiple DID directories can create.
</p>

<p>
    What does that governance look like? In a Network of Networks world, censorship resistance depends on strong governance that champions and facilitates convergence and cooperation while tolerating independence and innovation. The ability to censor depends on a network's ability to ignore other networks in favor of themselves. Governance must be carefully designed so that cooperation and mutual support are incentivized. Governance may need to institute measures like staking and quadratic membership fees to discourage natural monopolies. Without strong measures people, organizations, and governments will at best lose confidence in the network and at worst be held hostage to it. 
</p>

<p>
    Care must be taken to ensure that no single network gets so large that others cannot ignore it, but it can ignore them. Alternatively, we have to ensure that that network is one that is governed by the SSI principles that are consistent with the mission of Identity for All. The <a href="https://sovrin.org/library/sovrin-governance-framework/">Sovrin Governance Framework</a> is a start, but there is much work to be done. The Governance Framework Working Group has begun early work on the governance structure of a network of networks. The conversation is not over, but has only just begun.
</p>

     This can also impact credential holders, but the biggest way to censor credential holders is to control their wallet. That's the subject of a different, future post.

</h3>

<div class='item-body'>

<div class='item-snippet'>
<!-- use 'smarter' algorithm for cutoff snippet text

  Meetable is the software that runs events.indieweb.org and a couple other event sites that I host. Over the last couple months, we've had to cancel a bunch of IndieWeb events or convert them to virtual events, and I've been watching for patterns to see if there was anything the software could do to facilitate this.

<p>Meetable is the software that runs <a href="https://events.indieweb.org">events.indieweb.org</a> and a couple other event sites that I host. Over the last couple months, we've had to cancel a bunch of IndieWeb events or convert them to virtual events, and I've been watching for patterns to see if there was anything the software could do to facilitate this.</p>
<p>Today I just launched a few new features that will help out event organizers posting events on Meetable websites! I decided on adding these features by looking for things people were already doing by editing the event names or descriptions.</p>
 Event Status 
<p>Events now have a "status", which can be "confirmed" (the default), "postponed", "tentative", or "cancelled". Anything other than "confirmed" will show a little badge next to the event name calling out the event status.&nbsp;</p>

  

<p>This badge also appears on the event pages themselves. For postponed events, the date now says "TBD" in addition to the originally scheduled date.</p>

  

<p>This status can be set when you create the event initially, or edited later. This is useful for cases such as a regular weekly meeting that skips a week when you want to make sure attendees know that the event is actually cancelled and you didn't just forget to post it. Thanks to Tantek for <a href="https://tantek.com/2020/062/b5/">that suggestion</a>!</p>
<p>This status is included in the ICS feed as well, so you should see those statuses in your calendar app if you've subscribed to the ICS feeds.</p>
<p>Cancelled events also hide the RSVP button and stop accepting webmentions.</p>
<p>"Postponed" isn't one of the statuses in the iCal spec, but it's come up enough times that I thought it was worth adding anyway. I'm also not 100% sold on the icons and colors I chose for these, so suggestions are welcome. Please only suggest icons from the <a href="https://fontawesome.com/icons?m=free">font-awesome</a> collection though otherwise it's a lot more work.</p>

  

 Virtual Meeting URLs 
<p>Now that all of our events have been happening online, we need a place to share the link to join the online meeting. This isn't the same as the event website field that currently exists, since that's more for when you add an event that exists elsewhere like a related conference. Instead, this is specifically a link that you will click just before (or during) the event to join the online meeting, whether that's Zoom, Jitsi, Google Hangouts, or something else.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the patterns that's emerged from doing this manually is that people will update the event description to say "come back 15 minutes before the events starts to find the meeting link". This is for two reasons. Some platforms don't give you a meeting link until you start the meeting, and if the meeting link is persistent, then you don't want to share it too far in advance otherwise you might attract the zoombombers.</p>
<p>I added a new field to Meetable's event creation UI specifically to add the meeting URL. Meetable will hide the URL until 15 minutes before the event starts, and it will disappear again after the event is over.</p>

  

<p>Before the event starts, you'll see a note that the meeting link will be revealed 15 minutes before the event.</p>

  

<p>Once the event is less than 15 minutes away, the event page shows the join link.</p>

  

<p>This works regardless of what meeting platform you're using since all it's doing is conditionally showing a URL!</p>
 Built-In Zoom Scheduling 
<p>We give IndieWeb event organizers the option of using a shared IndieWeb Zoom account to host meetings. (Event organizers are always welcome to use whatever platform they choose, but we make this available thanks to our <a href="https://opencollective.com/indieweb">community sponsors</a> in case organizers want to use it.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since Zoom has skyrocketed in popularity as well has had some pretty major issues around zoombombing when being used for public events like this, it's become a lot more important to use unique meeting IDs and passwords for each event, whereas before we could get away with the lazy approach of using the permanent meeting ID on the account. This has lead to a lot more manual work by organizers when planning an event to go an log in and create a scheduled meeting. So I added a feature to Meetable which will use the Zoom API to automatically create a scheduled meeting at the right time for the event, and set the meeting URL to the zoom link!</p>
<p>Now when you create a virtual event in Meetable, you have a checkbox you can check which will go create a scheduled Zoom meeting for you!</p>

  

<p>Then 15 minutes before the event starts, the link will be shown on the page! As the organizer, you can log in to the Zoom account and you'll see the scheduled event in the Zoom app.&nbsp;</p>

  

<p>Since Zoom includes the password in the link itself, it's still one click to join the meeting this way!</p>
<p>That's about it! I hope you enjoy the new features, and let me know if you're using Meetable yourself!</p>
<p>If you'd like to see Meetable in action, check out the three instances I maintain:</p>
 
   <a href="https://events.indieweb.org">events.indieweb.org</a> 
   <a href="https://events.oauth.net">events.oauth.net</a> 
   <a href="https://oktadev.events">oktadev.events</a> 
 
<p>You can install Meetable on Heroku in about 5 minutes using the <a href="https://github.com/aaronpk/Meetable#meetable">Heroku Deploy</a> button! It even has a little <a href="https://aaronparecki.com/2020/01/18/7/meetable-updates">installer</a> so you can quickly install it on shared hosting as well!</p>
<p>If you have any ideas for additional features, please let me know! The best way is to <a href="https://github.com/aaronpk/Meetable/issues">open an issue</a> on GitHub, and if you see an existing issue that sounds like something you want, please comment or upvote it!</p>

  The IETF CBOR working group has adopted the specification Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) Tags for Date.

<p>The <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/cbor/about/">IETF CBOR working group</a> has adopted the specification Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) Tags for Date.  The abstract of the specification is:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR, RFC 7049) is a data format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the need for version negotiation.</p>
<p>In CBOR, one point of extensibility is the definition of CBOR tags. RFC 7049 defines two tags for time: CBOR tag 0 (RFC 3339 date/time string) and tag 1 (Posix “seconds since the epoch”). Since then, additional requirements have become known. This specification defines a CBOR tag for an RFC 3339 date text string, for applications needing a textual date representation without a time. It also defines a CBOR tag for days since the Posix epoch, for applications needing a numeric date representation without a time. It is intended as the reference document for the IANA registration of the CBOR tags defined.</p></blockquote>
<p>The need for this arose for the ISO Mobile Driver’s License specification in the working group <a href="https://www.iso.org/committee/45144.html">ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 17</a> “Cards and security devices for personal identification”.</p>

  </a>
    </p>
<p>I finally made it to the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop</a>. A three day unconference based on open space technology that has been running twice a year for the last 15 years. It’s a bit like a pilgrimage for the identity community. I am going to struggle to do it justice in words. This April IIW went virtual for the first time, and impressively so. It provided a glimpse into the future of virtual collaboration, a future that, due to the current situation, we find ourselves in is fast approaching.</p>
<p>A virtual event is more accessible, more inclusive and hundreds of thousands of air miles better for our planet (I would love to see some stats on this). I anticipate many events will consider staying virtual permanently or becoming semi-virtual and encourage all events to experiment with what virtualisation could mean for them. We have an opportunity to level up as individuals, communities and humanity as a whole - <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/COVID_Daze/Days_-_The_HumanOS_%26_new_relationships_w/connected_systems_%26_Services">the Human OS</a> - in terms of virtual participation, collaboration and value creation. In many ways these skills are the literacy and numeracy of the 21st century.</p>
<p>IIW went down about as smoothly as it could have, certainly smoother than most of us would have anticipated. Especially considering the timescales that the organisers made this pivot. However, we should recognise our privilege, not everyone has either the technology, connectivity or capability to take part. Working to empower others to influence change with and through technology should be high on our list of priorities. </p>
<p>Look at the map of IIW attendees, people from all over the world logged in and participated. How many of these would have missed out if the event was held in San Francisco? I know I would have.</p>
<p>
      <a>
    
  
  </a>
    </p>
<p>We are only 8 weeks into a world that is vastly different and changing fast. In many ways this is the warm up round <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/The_Future_ain%27t_what_it_used_to_be_%E2%80%94_How_to_approach_the_next_few_years_(COVID,_climate,_economic_depression_...)">The future ain’t what it used to be</a> and while this is certainly daunting.., in many ways the situation we currently find ourselves in could not have occurred at a more opportune moment. A substantial portion of the global population have the digital capabilities sitting within their homes to influence the direction of their lives in ways that would have been inconceivable even 10 years ago. The decisions we collectively take over the next few years could have more impact on the future of humanity than at any other time in history. </p>
<p>Importantly though, we should be alert to our blind sports, technology is not a panacea for all the worlds problems. There is no technical fix for the human condition. We need to work hard to design diverse, inclusive and equitable solutions. We should <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/Building_Technology_and_Successful_Use_Cases_based_on_the_most_marganilzed_as_the_answer_to_the_problem">develop successful use cases based on the most marginalised</a>. We need to be aware of <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/SSI_and_COVID-19_health_status_certificates_-_ethics,_policy_and_next_steps">the ethical implications</a>, <a href="https://me2balliance.groups.io/g/main/topic/digital_harms_dictionary_v1_0/69741179?p=,,,20,0,0,0::recentpostdate%2Fsticky,,,20,2,0,69741179">the digital harms</a>, <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/Vectors_of_Authoritarianism">the vectors of authoritarianism</a> and the unintended consequences that might be a result of the digital systems we push out into the world. We need to take ownership of the projects that we contribute to and hold ourselves accountable to our own morals and principles. </p>

<p>For me, the challenges with Self-Sovereignty are that as homo sapiens we are not. We are dependant on others for pretty much every aspect of our lives. We interconnected and part of a larger whole. We participate in communities, we are part of society and ultimately we are members of the human race. That is empowering and to be embraced. Together we have been able to achieve truly mind boggling feats.</p>
<p>I convened two open discussions on group identity to get a sense from the community about:</p>
 
 How do we model the identity of groups and our relationships to these  groups and within these groups? 
 How do the tools we are all building help us do this? 
 
<p>The conversations in both session were fascinating, thanks to everyone who took part. You can read the notes <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/Group_Identity_-_Open_Discussion">here</a>.</p>
<p>I also held a session with Nicky Hickman on a paper we are working on studying <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/Trust_/_Risk_Metrics_in_SSI_-_What_can_we_learn_from_technical_trust_in_order_to_inform_human_trust">metrics for SSI</a>. And I hung out in a garden on the final day to discuss my research lab and the <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/PhD_positions_at_Identity_lab_based_in_Edinburgh_-_Come_ask_me_about_it.">PhD opportunities we have coming up</a>.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed the gardens but feel they were underutilised. Shout out to Brent and Nathan in the SSI Hallway chat, I learnt some useful details sitting on the back row with them including that you could be in two zoom rooms at once. </p>
<p>The breadth and depth of the topics discussed at this workshop was staggering, inevitably leading to there being sessions you wish you attended but couldn’t. There were plenty of these for me, like all the <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/%22KERI_(A)_Key_Event_Receipt_Infrastructure._A_ledger_agnostic_framework_for_decentralized_identity._KERI_unifies_many_DID_methods_types.">KERI sessions</a> (must read the <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf">paper</a>), the session on <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/Malware_attacks_against_SSI,_how_SSI_may_be_the_perfect_honeypot_if_you're_not_careful">malware attacks against SSI</a> and the <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=Glossary_Results_-_Credentials,_Wallets,_Agents_Defined._%2B_Next_Steps&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">Glossary Results session</a>. I highly recommend exploring any of the <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/IIW_30_Session_Notes">session notes</a> that stand out to you in more detail. My thanks to Lisa and Hannah in the documentation centre and everyone who wrote up session notes.</p>
<p>I was also thoroughly impressed with the technology on display in the <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/IIW_30_Identity_Tech_Sandbox_Fair">tech sandbox fair</a> and <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/IIW_30_Demo_Hour">demo hour</a>. A couple of stand outs for me were the Transmute demo showing how to write a DID to the ledger using <a href="https://element-did.com/">element-did.com</a> and the demo of <a href="https://manifold.picolabs.io/">Manifold</a> including finding out they wrote their own <a href="https://github.com/Picolab/aries-cloudagent-pico">aries cloudagent</a> for a <a href="https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/pages/1189992/Persistent+Compute+Objects">PICO</a>. Very cool.</p>
<p>I wanted to keep this short and sweet and while writing this I realised I could talk technical for a looong time. So instead I hope to publish separate article focused down in the weeds. On <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/ZKPs_for_JSON-LD_using_BBS%2B_-_Round_2">BBS+ signatures</a> (awesome job from Mattr making these more accessible), <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa">Hyperledger Ursa</a>, <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/101_Session:_Verifiable_Credential_Handler_(CHAPI)_and_DIDComm">CHAPI/DIDComm</a> and <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/Come_teach_a_student_how_ZKP%27s_work_technically._Anybody_else_who_wants_to_know,_please_come,_and_someone_come_teach_us!">Zero Knowledge math</a> to name a few. One of the aspects I enjoyed most about IIW was that for the first time since becoming involved with identity I managed to form a good picture of the JSON-LD approach, tools and technologies for implementing Verifiable Credentials. I want to write up my new perspective on these technologies and highlight why I still believe anonymous credentials are a preferable approach.</p>
<p>I have not attributed any of the content in this article, but it many ways it could be attributed to everyone who participated in IIW XXX. This is simply a reflection of the thoughts and ideas that resonated with me over the course of the workshop. </p>
<p>Thank you everyone who organised, facilitated, sponsored, attended, participated, took notes and curated notes. Everyone who made my first IIW so memorable. I really appreciate it. I feel recharged and full of ideas and creativity. It was the boost I needed. It was a truly mind blowing three days.</p>
<p>Finally, I just want to add that I am fascinated by the potential to explore and improve on how we virtually connect, collaborate and co-create value. The QuQoChat configuration was impressive, but lets use this as a base to iterate on. I am sure we all have ideas for features we would have liked to see and I know there are plenty of events looking to go virtual to experiment with. If I had to call out one feature in particular, it would be the ability to have serendipitous virtual meetings. Some sort of networking portal that assigns you with someone for a 5 minute conversation before moving on. This could even work for larger group conversations like the virtual celebratory drinks, think tables at a pub. Zoom is great, but it is pretty hard to have flowing and inclusive conversations when there is a large group. </p>

Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.

Our birth as people is immediately powerful, for a learning machine has arrived active, soaking up information, with root permissions granted, and protected as a gift of humanity. Mothers sustain, mothers and fathers together as Individuals in the best of times, and always hopefully in the rest.. give possibility and protection to new human lives imbued with direct power and authority to learn, to derive understanding and opportunity by virtue of breathing.<br><br>This is our Sovereign beginning..<br><br>Our mutual defense of life, liberty, and our pursuit of happiness as Individuals is why systems exist. When systems exist, they administer information about you, about your relationship to the system. Systems are designed, and operate according to a design. If the design is garbage, the experience is garbage.<br><br>In 2020, as an American using the systems that are being provisioned unto leaders of Sovereign consent and authority, our administration systems are garbage. The administration designs and methods are garbage. The ability to administer the functional reality of what it means to be a human and citizen of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA is garbage. Our mutual defense is not being achieved. People are dying. More will die, unnecessarily.<br><br>In 2020, "we" hold some Rights as unalienable, derived by our consent for our mutual defense in protecting the life, liberty and pursuits of happiness by American Individuals, and really all human Individuals all over the world. Or, we cease to be Americans.<br><br>This is our Self-Sovereign reformatting..<br><br>Individual Americans, your administration begins with an identifier. This identifier is the basis of civil Society. "We" use it during a time of census to administer information of value in our governance as a system derived of, by, and for the consent of the people, citizens of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. We call this system of administration, in whole, derived by our consent, the Government. It is an instituted outcome of consent. It may be edited, dissolved, or reformatted.. and re-Constituted according to the consent of the governed, people who give consent as Individuals.<br><br>In the dead past, which you can access via history books at the public library thanks to the generosity of many people, systems required handling using different methods and tools than today, in 2020. Today, we have access to information technologies that make systems far more powerful, far more capable of administrative functions that one could only dream about in 1776, and far more useful to people, if they possess direct unalienable access.<br><br>This is our problem..<br><br>"We" need to fix our mis-representation.. Individuals have allowed constituencies to take control of Sovereign systems of administration, exploiting weak designs in how power, authority, and control of assets serving an Individual's life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness derive consent. Mob rule due to mass-dynamics of voter management and employment dependencies, or even worse, access to health care services, has produced a compliance model that is embarrassing to the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA as an artifact of "We the people", in every home across America, where every family is made of the Individuals that are necessary for the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA to exist.<br><br>This is our opportunity..<br><br>Each of us as Individuals need to re-claim direct consent, to enforce our authority as one part of "We the people" instituted among mankind for our mutual defense of life, liberty and our pursuit of happiness. Our children must possess an identity that comes from family, is protected by family, advanced by family, and controlled by family until the day that an accountable Individual person emerges from the family giving it life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness as the root gift of their existence.<br><br>Agreement = Consent..<br><br>Every contract structure enforces consent. Guard your words, protect your deeds. Give structure to your life, and make sure that the structure you choose to give consent to accurately represents your existence as a human being, and American citizen. You, every one of you, possess root authority and serve as the source of direct consent of the governed, from which our mutual defense is manufactured. You are a critical component of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Do not cede it for too little. Hold it close, fight for it when you must. Protect and defend that which you possess personally. You do not need to ask for permission. Permission is derived by your consent directly.<br><br>Teach the young..<br><br>Functional literacy, the kind that lives in the real world, not just in a textbook, is required by all people. Life itself puts this requirement in the possession of people as learners, and people quickly learn that together, as families, as friends, as social bodies that can mutually defend our personal interests, our outcomes are improved together, each of us as Individuals. Our lives, our liberty, and our Individual pursuit of happiness is made stronger by association with others who also have such strong root empowerment as people.

<p>“May you live in interesting times”<br>– someone who clearly had a sardonic streak</p>



<p>I’d call the time we’re living in right now more than just interesting. The COVID-19 pandemic has hit every organization like a ton of bricks, and we’re all struggling to adapt. Obviously one of the biggest challenges has been the need for every organization to support a much bigger work-from-home scenario than they are used to. And that has created a myriad of problems for companies as they adjust to this new normal, where they have to find out how to keep their workforce productive while keeping data and sensitive corporate resources protected.</p>



<p>Having your remote workforce jump from 10-20% to over 90% in such a short period of time has broken the network perimeter model of security that so many organizations defaulted to. Call center applications and customer service systems that have access to sensitive customer data and PII, project management and bug tracking systems, servers and databases holding sensitive corporate data – workers have been cut off from getting access. VPN systems that were set up to serve a small remote workforce are straining to scale up to, or remain cost effective, for companies that have moved to a complete work-from-home model. Startups and other smaller organizations with limited IT staff have been particularly hard hit. And with people having to now use their personal computers on their home WiFi systems, the corporate security and individual privacy concerns have landed front and center. People don’t want their personal traffic flowing into the corporate network, and IT don’t want to deal with the added traffic and the hassle of helping people properly secure home WiFi.</p>



<p>Uniken has been forced to go through the same transition as so many other companies, as our employees and contractors had to completely cut over to working from home over one weekend. One of the things that helped us do this securely was our use of one of our own products that is part of the <a href="https://www.uniken.com/rel-id-solution">REL-ID Security Platform</a> – the REL-ID Desktop app. We configured it for use by our employees in engineering, finance and HR to get access to the sensitive applications and servers running in our data center that was restricted to the office network. Seeing our success with this, and hearing feedback and requests from customers who have been using REL-ID Desktop for secure remote access for a while, we broadened the capability to create <a href="https://www.uniken.com/wfh">REL-ID WFH (REL-ID Work-From-Home)</a>.&nbsp;</p>



  



<p>REL-ID WFH High Level Architecture</p>



<p>Built on the core security capabilities of the REL-ID Security Platform, REL-ID WFH relies on user authentication and device identity to grant multi-factor role-based access to applications, with all traffic secured using an individualized, encrypted network connection. REL-ID WFH lets your employees and extended workforce access internal web apps, servers, databases and client-server applications from their corporate or personal computers, without the need for a traditional remote-access VPN. REL-ID WFH can be easily installed by the remote workers themselves without the need for IT to install certificates or remotely access the workers personal device. With REL-IDs MITM-proof secure channel, organizations don’t have to worry about the implications of inadequately secured home WiFi. Furthermore, unlike most corporate VPNs, REL-ID WFH splits the traffic at the computer itself, only sending corporate traffic to the proxy running within the corporate network (no 3rd parties get visibility), and letting personal traffic go straight out to the internet without entering the corporate network. This provides the remote workers the privacy they need, while preventing the bandwidth of the corporate network from getting overwhelmed. There are a host of other security oriented features as well that you can learn more about <a href="https://www.uniken.com/wfh">here</a>.</p>



<p>In these difficult times, we’re committed to helping organizations that, just like ourselves, have an immediate need for quickly enabling secure remote access. In conjunction with <a href="https://www.uniken.com/press/uniken-releases-a-powerful-new-solution-for-work-from-home-security-in-the-age-of-covid-19">announcing the availability of REL-ID WFH</a>, we’ve worked with our partners to put in place special programs and quickstart guides to rapidly get you up and running, and are also waiving all license fees for REL-ID WFH for the entirety of 2020. So if you need help solving the pressing need of providing secure remote access to your remote workforce, <a href="https://www.uniken.com/contact">get in touch</a>. We’re happy to help.</p>

<p>5/12は本来European Identity Conference (EIC) で、そこでKeynote をするよていだったのですが、新型コロナでカンファレンスはキャンセルされ、その代わりに Virtual Event が行われることになりました。</p>



<p>イベントの名前は「<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/identity-fabrics-iam?ref=bigma">Identity Fabrics &amp; the Future of Identity Management</a>」です。もともとのEICでわたしが演る予定だったのは、1月のOpenID Summit でやった話をもとにした「No ID, No DX」というものをドイツ向けにカスタマイズしたもので、Synopsys はこうなっていました。</p>



<p>Industrial revolutions share two common properties: 1) New Increasing Return Technological Paradigm and 2) New Funding Methods. In the first industrial revolution, they were the steam engine and the fiat money creation. The combination allowed the British to create a Global Empire capitalizing on the increasing return nature. The same pattern holds for the 4th industrial revolution as well. This time, it was the cyberspace and the money creation system called “Silicon Valley”. This time, however, the land grab is not on the existing continent. It is on a newly formed 8th continent, also known as “Cyberspace.” For the time being, GAFAM seems to be prevalent there but the battle is not over yet. To survive the battle, we have to change the way we conduct our business to fit the new technological reality. Retrofitting the new technology to the old way delivers quick result but does not allow to fully capitalize on the new reality and result in the colonization. To avoid it, there is no other way but transform the business and system to identity-centric architecture because otherwise, your system will not be increasing return.<br></p>



<p>Key takeaways:<br>1. To capitalize on the 4th Industrial Revolution, we have to transform ourselves to be fit with the new space: cyberspace.&nbsp;<br>2. Retro-fitting the new technologies to the existing ways of conducting business will only gain the short-term result and disadvantage you in the long-term.&nbsp;<br>3. What’s needed now is to convert the business architecture and put the user-centric identity system that delineates authentication, claims provision, authorization and relation forming. Otherwise, the system will start to show the decreasing return characteristics and slows your business. That will be fatal in the midst of an industrial revolution.&nbsp;<br>4. Start moving towards such an architecture and demand vendors the support of it to survive.</p>



<p>実は提言の一部は新型コロナのせいですでに実現してしまったので、ちょっと変えなければならないのですが、概ねは以上のような感じです。お楽しみに。日本時間の16時20分からです。</p>

<p>We’re making progress on a simple application-level proof-of-possession solution for OAuth 2.0.  I’m pleased to report that DPoP has now been adopted as an OAuth working group specification.  The abstract of the specification is:</p>
<blockquote><p>
This document describes a mechanism for sender-constraining OAuth 2.0 tokens via a proof-of-possession mechanism on the application level. This mechanism allows for the detection of replay attacks with access and refresh tokens.</p></blockquote>
<p>The specification is available at:</p>

<p>The “feature snowball”, as I like to call it, is a product and time management technique I’ve been successfully implementing for the last 10 years or so. I’ve used it across many personal projects, work projects, and consulting projects with great success.</p>

<p>Today, I’d like to explain what the feature snowball method is, why you may (or may not) want to adopt it yourself, and how it’s worked out for me in my own life.</p>

<p>But first, let me tell you a little bit about myself.</p>

 My Background in Tech 

<p>I’ve been programming for nearly 20 years at the time of my writing this, 11 of which have been professional. Through my professional tech career, I’ve primarily worked on small projects: things a single person (or small group of people) could build and maintain.</p>

<p>Because of this, I’ve always had to fulfill the roles of a developer, product manager, QA engineer, DevOps practitioner, DBA, SEO expert, marketer, salesperson, frontend designer, and security auditor all at once. I haven’t ever worked on teams large enough where there were dedicated people to handle these functions.</p>

 Struggling with Productivity 

<p></p>

<p>Because I’ve always had to wear a lot of hats while working on projects, early on in my career I often struggled with productivity. The biggest productivity obstacle for me has always been how to prioritize my work.</p>

<p>For example, while I was growing <a href="https://www.ipify.org/">ipify</a> I had to decide whether I’d build developer libraries in a number of different programming languages, write docs for the website, optimize the backend infrastructure for performance, reduce hosting cost, improve the website design, support IPv6 lookups, or perform marketing tasks to help grow the service.</p>

<p>While each of these tasks was critical to the success of the service, I could only work on one thing at a time. This meant I had to think about and consciously choose which of these important tasks I’d work on.</p>

<p>Now, I don’t know about you, but picking what to work on has always been the hardest part for me.</p>

<p>Before I discovered the feature snowball method, I’d spend hours (sometimes days) carefully thinking through which tasks I’d work on next, how important each was in comparison to the others, and how much I was looking forward to (or dreading) each task.</p>

<p>I’d sometimes reflect back on the week and realize I had spent countless hours feeling anxious and dreading work only because I wasn’t sure where I should spend my time. Some people call this “analysis paralysis” or “decision fatigue”, but whatever you want to call it, it’s always been a pain in my ass.</p>

 Thinking About Productivity 

<p></p>

<p>One day, early on in my career, I was getting a shower and thinking through what I had to work on the following week. As usual, I had a neverending list of important things to do. The more I thought about what I had to do the following week, the more anxious I felt.</p>

<p>In order to combat my increasing anxiety about work, I decided to think about all the things I had finished at work over the last week. As I went through the list, I started to feel better. And not just a little better, I started getting excited.</p>

<p>The more I thought about all the things I had accomplished, the more I wanted to get back to work and finish more things. I could feel the momentum building, and I didn’t want it to slow down.</p>

<p>This gave me an idea: what if next week I just finished as many things as possible from my todo list? What if I just picked the easiest things to work on, exclusively focused on those, and built as much momentum as possible?</p>

<p>The more I thought about it, the more excited I got. By the time my shower ended I was all in on my new productivity experiment.</p>

 The Productivity Experiment 

<p></p>

<p>The following week at work was amazing.</p>

<p>Instead of painstakingly debating with myself about what to work on, I took a quick look at my tasks, picked whatever seemed the simplest, and focused all my effort on whatever that was.</p>

<p>I distinctly remember crossing five or six long standing tasks off my list that day, which made me feel amazing. The more things I finished, the more productive and less anxious I felt.</p>

<p>By the end of the week, I felt like a completely different person. I was excited about my work, I wasn’t anxious, and I had knocked a ton of items off my todo list. I was on a roll.</p>

<p>My boss at the time (if you’re reading this: hi David!) told me, after the sprint ended, that he was impressed I had finished so much. My velocity had more than doubled through the course of the sprint.</p>

<p>After that week ended, I decided to keep the experiment going for another week. That second week turned into three weeks, which turned into a month, which quickly turned into the last 10 years.</p>

 The Feature Snowball Method 

<p></p>

<p>The feature snowball method, as I like to call it, is a simplistic product and time management system in which you determine priorities based on how quick something is to complete.</p>

<p>Instead of deciding which features to build, bugs to fix, or tasks to work on based on business or personal priority (which is the typical way prioritization happens), instead you decide what to work on based on only a single variable: how long will it take to finish?</p>

<p>If you’re deciding between writing email copy for an upcoming marketing campaign, fixing a bug in your Dockerfile, or building out that new feature your company wants: do some quick analysis to figure out how much time each task will take, then get to work on the smallest task.</p>

<p>Much like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-snowball_method">debt snowball</a> method for paying down debt, the feature snowball method prioritizes momentum over everything else. The idea is that by getting quick wins and gradually reducing the things you need to do, you’ll be able to stay focused, motivated, and make progress towards whatever it is you’re trying to accomplish: whether that be building a product, cleaning your house, or working on passion projects.</p>

 Why You May Want to Use the Feature Snowball Method 

<p></p>

<p>If you’re working in a small team or on some sort of personal project/hobby, the feature snowball method can be a great way to “get over” the anxiety and productivity dips that many people (like me) experience when they’re overwhelmed.</p>

<p>I’ve found that by ceding control of my priorities to a simple system, I’m able to execute on what I need to do without any anxiety. In turn, this makes me more productive and I end up accomplishing more. The net result is that my work efficiency goes up: I spend more of my time making progress on projects and less of my time managing priorities.</p>

<p>In my professional life, I also use the feature snowball method extensively, including at my current job as the Head of Evangelism at <a href="https://developer.okta.com/">Okta</a>. I use Trello to manage all my work tasks, and each week I prioritize my tasks by complexity and knock them off one at a time, least complex first.</p>

<p>Of course, there are exceptions to the rule.</p>

<p>For example, a few months ago we were preparing to launch our yearly conference, <a href="https://www.oktane20.com/">Oktane</a>, so I had to completely ignore my backlog and exclusively focus on Oktane-specific tasks in order to wrap things up.</p>

<p>Were these Oktane-specific tasks always the simplest things to do? Definitely not! But, within the list of urgent Oktane tasks I had to attend to, I still followed the feature snowball method as much as possible.</p>

<p>Each week I’d sort through what urgent tasks had to be completed, then I’d simply tackle each task in order of how quick I could complete them. By utilizing the feature snowball method in this manner, I’m able to remain effective at work while still keeping my momentum up and anxiety down.</p>

 Why You May Not Want to Use the Feature Snowball Method 

<p></p>

<p>There are, of course, many situations in which you wouldn’t want to use the feature snowball method.</p>

<p>For example, while my current job is fairly independent in that I can choose what to work on and, for the most part, can accomplish what I need to solo, there are many jobs where that isn’t an option.</p>

<p>If you’re working on a project and have a strict deadline to get a feature out the door, you may very well need to work on whatever is most urgent.</p>

<p>Likewise, if you’re working on a project that involves working with other people in some sort of synchronous manner, you may not have the luxury of deferring a task simply because it’s more complex than another.</p>

<p>I guess what I’m saying is that your mileage may vary. Use common sense, and don’t sacrifice important tasks for the sake of a productivity philosophy.</p>

 My Results with the Feature Snowball Method 

<p></p>

<p>As I mentioned near the start of this article, I’ve been successfully using the feature snowball method for the last 10 years or so. It’s not only helped me to improve my productivity, but it’s helped me enjoy my work more.</p>

<p>If you’re the type of person who feels excited and motivated when they finish projects and cross things off their todo list, you may want to give the feature snowball method a try. It’s completely changed the way I work, my outlook, and the daily enjoyment of what I do every day.</p>

 Mapping &amp; Mincing the Ideology of Decentralized Identity 

 tl;dr 

<p>I was asked to introduce “decentralized identity qua [ideological] movement” at #IIW30 as part of Karyl Fowler’s “Intro to SSI” <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/KarylFowler/introduction-to-selfsovereign-identity">session</a> and it spurred what might generously be called a productive moment of reflection on whether I’m adding to or subtracting from an ideological fog that could well serve as a smokescreen for profiteering. I tried to map decentralized identity as a confluence of three perhaps unrelated agendas that contingently agree on a shared technological toolkit. I found the exercise useful and generative for myself, although I can’t say the resulting excursus was particularly illuminating for the many IIW first-timers attending the session, some of whom rightly asked wtf I was on about in post-presentation Q&amp;A. Afterwards, posting the diagram to twitter, Philip Sheldrake also asked wtf I was on about, but in the key of ideological critique, so I did my best to answer fairly but essentially off the cuff; these remarks are appended as well, as convincing as they may or may not be as answers to Philip’s questions. Since <a href="https://www.identitywoman.net/">Kaliya Young</a> put out a rallying cry at another panel of the same conference to bring back blogging, I thought I should convert the exercise into an old-fashioned, early-00s style blog reflection. Luckily, I already had this blog set up thanks to indieweb enthusiast <a href="https://www.decentralized-id.com">Infominer</a>! All photos by <a href="https://www.thelacmastore.org/products/barbara-kruger-remote-control">Barbara Kruger</a> except the second, by <a href="https://lauraphotographystudent.wordpress.com/2016/02/04/barbara-kruger-my-impression/">Laura Spencer</a>.</p>

 

<p>The backstory to this excursus is that I have been following lots of adjacent but essentially unrelated (and in many cases older) currents in European data activism lately, trying to deepen and widen my familiarity with other currents in technological thinking with similar goals to my own. Now that I work full-time for a for-profit, mostly closed-source software <a href="https://www.spherity.com/">company</a> that builds decentralized identity products, I think a lot about what the end-game is, and where the incentives of a company looking to create a sustainable, defensible niche for itself might diverge from the incentives of some amorphous agenda held by the “big tent” of deentralized identity technologists, which includes lots of non-profit driven work being done by governments and open-source communities. In particular, the European Commission’s “Next Generation Internet” <a href="https://www.ngi.eu/">projects</a> has just been killing it in the crates lately, funding stop-gaps and bridges to make profit-driven Web3.0 work more useful to the public good.</p>

<p>As for the excursus itself, Karyl Fowler, CEO of <a href="https://transmute.industries/">Transmute Industries</a>, asked me to co-present an “Introduction to SSI,” filling in for my old boss Heather Vescent at the <a href="https://www.thepurpletornado.com/">Purple Tornado</a>, who had lead the session at #IIW29. As a way of dividing the topic in two, Karyl presented SSI as a technology, asking me to present it as a movement. Having long participated in the community as a freelance/free-range thinker, this made sense: my engagements with decentralized identity unmoored to any business interests had left a trail of <a href="http://www.caballerojuan.com/blog/ssi/the-next-big-thing-is-you/">manifestos</a> and <a href="https://www.sourcecheck.org/">attempts</a> to bridge public-good thinking and decentralized identity tech. Rather than defer to the spokespersons or dogmas within SSI that are easily enough googled and refered to by all the introductory texts linked to in the slide deck’s bibliography, I thought instead it might be fun to map the fuzzy boundaries and influences of the widest possible ideological snapshot.</p>

<p>To this end, I wanted to map it out partly to inspire and educate newcomers to the space (the intended audience of the presentation, of course), but also for myself, to stay honest to what pushed me to work in this space to begin with. Recently, Women In Identity published a short but potent <a href="https://womeninidentity.org/2020/03/31/data-portability/">piece</a> co-written by two thinkers far more qualified than me to judge the effectiveness of data policy and business practice, <a href="https://mattr.global/">Mattr</a>’s Emily Fry and privacy lawyer and policy advocate <a href="https://hackylawyer.com/about">Elizabeth Reineris</a>. The piece frankly described how the social good of data portability was better served by pro-active regulatory change and legislation than by swapping one for-profit tech business model for another, which struck me as an entirely reasonable interpretation of recent events. Having recently been reading up on lots of data rights activism (MyData in particular) and having recently applied to a European Commision-funded grant program to directly support infrastructure for pragmatic data portability, I took issue with the either/or framing, however, since it allows a vocal minority within the decentralized community to speak for the whole and holds that minority’s marketing claims against the whole community. I tried to resolve the apparent contradiction, because:</p>
 
   I also think technology alone will not save the little guy from market forces, 
   I also prefer regulatory reform to private investment as a seawall against privacy harms, and 
   I don’t support private investment that I believe will hinder (or even detract from the urgency of) forces pushing for that reform. 
 

<p>But in the week between that exchange and IIW30, I got to wondering– have some who speak on behalf of decentralized identity promised a market-driven solution to a societal problem? (It’s worth noting an) In many cases, it certainly has, but I would like to believe in that bigger tent, in which decentralized identity (as a business model, and as a set of technologies both private and public, open- and closed-source) can lock open the infrastructure private interests build in such a way that allows for other uses in the public good. If profiteers succeed in shrinking that tent enough to make my belief look naïve or deluded, I’m calling it quits and looking for work elsewhere. In one form or another, this has been my personal investment in the “movement” which decentralized identity (and to a greater degree, that subset of the community that prefers the term “self-sovereign identity” for various reasons), which I have been vocal enough about that Karyl asked me to present that portion of her introduction to the topic.</p>

<p>In any case, here is what I came up with in (full disclosure) 30 minutes of spitballing spread out across three days:</p>

<p></p>

<p>As is usually the case with pitchdeckery, I had to present this tentative map to a room full of guinea pigs and gets some flack about it to fine-tune it in 3 or 4 ways to arrive at the version I’m posting above. But I always wanted to post some further clarifications and challenges that came via Twitter from the <a href="https://akasha.org/blog/category/identity">Akasha Foundation</a>'s resident techno-solutionism skeptic Sheldrake.</p>

 

<p></p>

 Trust Economics 

<p>DLT tech is only one form taken by trust economics more generally, and definitely what Christopher Allen calls “trustless economics” falls under this category. For further reading on the LESS/Trustless divide within decentralized identity thinking, see Phil Windley’s excellent <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/03/supporting_less_and_trustless_identity.shtml">blog post</a> on the subject. There, Windley lays out Christopher Allen’s and Tim Bouma’s core concepts for a wider audience. I would also clarify that in both Allen’s and Bouma’s original writings on the subject, “trustless” does not refer primarily to real-world trust but rather to cryptographic trust, applying to information businesses an  analogy to “zero trust” thinking in <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3247848/what-is-zero-trust-a-model-for-more-effective-security.html">cybersecurity</a>. There, “trustless” refers to a move away from reliance on “security perimeters” wide or narrow, opting instead for an “always verify” approach to data and self-certifying/proving identifiers.</p>

<p>But to further complicate this dogpile of domain-specific usages of the term “trust,” I would define “trust economics” for my purposes here as the analysis of the economic role played by not just real-world trust, but also business trust (i.e., liability and risk), as well as technological/informational trust (see above). I am at best an armchair economist, but I would like to think that macroeconomics can actually be a fruitful homebase for interdisciplinary analyses, and this is one such analysis. In my view, trust economics draws from many new ways of protecting data rights and new ways of building platform/ecosystem business models, whether aligned more with L.E.S.S., with for-profit businesses, or with more anonymous/non-state-based economic projects like the <a href="https://idena.io/">Idena network</a>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Sam Smith has written about the “trust tax” in his original meta-platform <a href="https://medium.com/selfrule/meta-platforms-and-cooperative-network-of-networks-effects-6e61eb15c586">essay</a>, as the co-founder of Spherity, Carsten Stöcker, in a co-written <a href="https://www.cognizant.com/whitepapers/how-blockchain-can-slash-the-manufacturing-trust-tax-codex2279.pdf">article</a> of speculative trust economics. The search for alternatives to the “trust tax” whereby the corporation is the only monetizer of trust and guarantor of business trust. To my linking Sam’s article, Philip responded, <code>"Sam's piece is partly predicated on the cost of needing to trust each other historically ("trust tax"). In seeking to minimise those costs, one seeks to need less trust.</code> I think this misses the point of trust economics: companies “trust” each other based on a mix of liability, historically-based predictions, relationships bound by contracts, and actuary calculations of risk, and relying more on one mechanism and less on another does not lower the world’s total supply for trust in zero-sum terms! Trust economics is a kind of double-entry accounting, tracking how trust changes forms and metrics. If there is a zero-sum game at all, it is that for-profit corporations fundamentally trust no one but themselves by nature, and hedge in one way or the other any risks they take in trusting others!</p>

<p>All of this is to say that trust economics, like economics generally, is not a very gay science: approaching issues of trust across different domains from an economic perspective can (and should) drain any warm-and-fuzzy feelings from the term. It will, I hope, be a corrective to the tendency in identity marketing towards what Tim Bouma has called <a href="https://twitter.com/trbouma/status/1213514724727513091">“trustwashing”</a>, whereby technological or legal assurance can be offered as a substitute for actual faith in institutions or businesses under the vague term of “trust”. I know some identity and data technologists (like Paul Knowles of the <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/">Human Colossus Foundation</a>) would gladly see this over-used term put to rest, but perhaps my academic background inclines me to flogging the horse until it is way too dead to be of any use to the marketing department.</p>

 

<p></p>

 What is the fate of the intersubjective and the collective under a regime of “personal data”? 

<p>This is one question where I feel I could never satisfy Philip, whose own <a href="https://akasha.org/blog/category/identity">writings</a> on identity often focus on this fundamental problem. Profit-driven information technology is generally at the very bleeding edge of capitalism’s perennial imperative to atomize and render all human activity subject to contract, [intellectual property] ownership, and individual liability. If we interpret GDPR’s definition of “personal” data too literally or simplistically, we risk uncritically furthering this aim and making our digital lives even more atomized and cut off from community and civic virtue than our physical ones. I think I share with Akasha the hope that alternatives exist to that! I also share with many the hope that GDPR and data law generally can evolve in more collective and community-supporting directions.  I’ll return to that in a moment.</p>

<p></p>

<p>But before tackling that more general question about legal frameworks, I can address the more properly ideological qualm about “sovereignty.” I actually use the term quite rarly except in the phrase “data sovereignty,” because this compound includes collective and communitarian forms of sovereignty. Coming from the far left where sovereignty means something very different than it does in mainstream American political usage, I am particularly interested in the tendency to establish data ownership by the Commons, whether defined <a href="https://decodeproject.eu/data-commons-city">geographically</a> or <a href="https://www.opendatacommons.org/">internationally</a>. In fact, my first contribution to the decentralized identity community was co-authoring (scribing and editing, really) an <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot6-santabarbara/blob/master/final-documents/sustainable-commons.md">RWoT paper</a> on the role of identity technology in the data commons co-authored by Adrian Gropper, who is, years later, still tirelessly arguing for the work of bottoms-up governance and self-selecting communities as the most viable unit of data sovereignty, most recently in the context of Covid mitigation <a href="https://bit.ly/Trustee-Ethics">techniques</a>.</p>

<p>Back to terminology, I have personally started to move away from the term “self-sovereignty” because I feel that rhetoric (with its open debts to cyberlibertarianism) too often undervalues communities and collective actors not motivated by profit, and caricatures government and civil society as either nuisances or badly-run corporations. Outside the United States, these echoes and resonances more seriously impede civil society’s and the public sector’s interest in decentralized identity technologies. I avoid using the term “SSI” primarily because the aura of being a [cyberlibertarian] North American export makes decentralized identity less attractive or useful as a tool in European or Global South efforts towards data sovereignty, full stop. If decentralized identity does nothing more than further entrench North American techno-colonialism, that would be another sign it’s time to cash in my chips and go back to painting houses for a living, or teaching languages and literary theory.</p>

 Are data unions collectively and organically governed enough to be any safer for our data than corporations and the state? 

<p>Forgive the hysterics, but I can only get defensive at the implication that unions are bad for community, an assertion which is anathema to my personal politcal ideology. My grandfather worked his whole adult life as a union accountant in Argentina, and never abandoned his public support for his small-farmer collective even during the multiple periods of his life where it was quite literally dangerous to align oneself publically with the union movement. As we joke in Argentina, it was only a “Cold War” in the lucky countries; it got pretty hot where my parents lived when I was born.</p>

<p>I’ll be blunt: unions can be corrupt, they can be centralizing forces, and they can collaborate with other centralizing (or tyrannical) forces, and often have under every form of capitalism and capitalism-alternative yet seen. They are imperfect institutions for pooling the power of workers against capital, and may not be much better, on average, than churches or countries or corporations. But neither labor unions nor data unions can be accused of being inherently centralizing without caricaturing the breadth and variety of theory and praxis grouped under the umbrella of unions as a social form. I will die on this hill, although I’d rather not have to (and it certainly influenced my choice to move to Europe).</p>

<p></p>

<p>I am no expert on data unions, but I support lots of the writing and thinking about data collectives and unions coming out the <a href="https://mydata.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/04/Understanding-Mydata-Operators-pages.pdf">MyData</a>, <a href="https://www.me2balliance.org/me2b-principles.html">Me2B Alliance</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g5R-6f7Sd4">Radical Exchange</a> communities and elsewhere. It is an emerging legal and social form that I hope comes into more focus in theory and practice in the coming years. I don’t think the identity tech community can afford to leave this thinking out of the “big tent” of decentralized identity. I sincerely hope that as the Trust-over-IP Foundation is built out and takes on a more international focus, these kinds of sense-making can be incorporated substantially in its mission and the scope of its discussions about roles and rights. Until now, the <a href="http://sovrin.org/blog/">Sovrin foundation</a> has been pretty good about keeping sovereignty, accessibility, and equity in scope, so I have every reason to believe the new venture will as well.</p>

<p>More generally, though, I guess the process of writing this essay has made clear to me that I need to invest more time in not just studying the efforts of others but actually putting my shoulder to the wheel of making data unions a thing worth having faith in.  Live better, compute union!</p>

 Every time I hear the word “decentralization” I reach for my checkbook 

<p>I couldn’t agree more, and I love the <a href="https://osf.io/m7wyj/">article</a> in question, but I think we do Nathan Schneider’s analysis a disservice by using it as an acid bath with which to dismiss any and all interest in decentralization as hypocritical or bad-faith smokescreening of ulterior motives. Paradoxically, I think the calls to decentralize (or re-decentralize) the internet are both legitimate and unrealistic, worthwhile and impossible to definitively scope or measure.</p>

<p>I would rather use Schneider’s analysis as a yardstick against which to measure individual projects of decentralization (and the business models or policy changes they are used to justify). Setting no goal more specific than “decentralizing” an isolated aspect of the stack or the economy is a recipe for superficial coalitions and disappointing outcomes, with that I completely agree. In Schneider’s own words, his “evidence …across several fields suggests that processes of decentralization in one part of a system seem to enable centralization in another,” and no one passionately working towards decentralized identity I know would be so naïve as to claim otherwise.</p>

<p></p>

<p>For instance, much work to create a more decentralized web stack leads to a short-term reliance on contemporary cloud infrastructure in many cases, which is clearly trading in the “centralization” of DNS and TCP/IP for a far more geopolitically and ideologically dangerous <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/we-need-to-talk-about-cloud-neutrality/">centralization</a>, at least in the short-term. But organizations like <a href="https://nextcloud.com">NextCloud</a> and <a href="https://holochain.org">HoloChain</a> have long maintained active ties to the decentralized identity community, and I have every hope that, just as decentralized identity may be able to ween itself off of blockchains and distributed ledger technologies altogether with advances such as the <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.11_web.pdf">KERI</a> protocol, so too might a less mercenary model of the cloud computing arise in the coming years.</p>

<p>As for how effectively we are decentralizing anything and what other forms of centralization we might play into, the decentralized identity community regularly and heatedly debates this issue. Sometimes these debates devolve into a macho ritual we self-effacingly call “cagematches” (usually at in-person conferences, between old friends), while at other times these debates are channeled into collaborative thinking and writing like that captured in this <a href="https://stories.jolocom.com/interoperability-between-de-centralized-identity-providers-baa297eb1aa8">essay</a>. Jolocom founder <a href="https://twitter.com/JockelLohkamp">Joachim Lohkamp</a> in particular has consistently pushed for this debate to be foregrounded and not deferred or sidelined. He’s pushed for a <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot9-prague/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/rubrics.md">rubric</a> that might scaffold and structure decision-making about decentralization (and recentralization) at different layers of the stack to be included in the DID core specification, such that the debate could inform the process of standardization and shine a light on recentralizations created along the way. I do not sit on the Worldwide Web Consortium committee that is editing this rubric, but I personally welcome its inclusion in the specification and the foregrounding of these criteria.</p>

 Trust Triangles are a registered trademark of SSI Corp, LLC 

<p>This question struck me as a little disingenuous, since I did not refer to the issuer/holder/verifier triangle anywhere in my diagram, nor anywhere in the technology portion of the presentation either. Since the most widely-disseminated introductions to SSI come from an overtly business-friendly perspective (with governance, policy, and social-good perspectives gestured at but rarely delved into), this has been slipped in as if it were an ideological foundation of decentralized identity or practice, when in fact it is simply the foundation of one business model for decentralized identity. What’s more, it is not even a particularly universal business model– many others currently being funded and subsidizing infrastructural investments for the others (for instance, those dealing only with verified identities but not credentialing, or privacy-preserving big data analytics) are not much illuminated by the triangular model. The familiar triangle would be more accurate described as the basis for credential-based verified information dataflows; even calling it a “trust triangle” seems to me needlessly confusing for all the reasons mentioned above that risk turning “trust” into a weasel-word.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I am personally not a huge fan of the issuer/holder/verifier triangle as an explanatory device outside of very specific business contexts. It is most useful when explaining decentralized identity’s most common models for access tokens and reusable credentials by contradistinction from centralized and/or federated identity models in today’s identity and access management practice. After all, the three terms and their relations are canonical and central to the business model of traditional IAM, a multi-billion dollar subindustry within software with its own bibliography and dedicated MBA programs.</p>

<p>The “foundational triangle” is a schematization of relations of power into business relationships that can be rigidified by contracts, just as Philip insinuates. This model is great for building a business model, but should ot be backfilled into the ideological underpinnings or social analysis of the technology’s broader utility and effects. For that, the non-profit and academic work on online harms (and harm reduction) are a better starting point than marketing materials and business-plan pitch decks uploaded to linkedin for the perusal of venture capitalists.</p>

 Conclusion 

<p>In summary, the answer to all 5 questions is this: there is a better and a worse way to do/conceive/build the general term addressed. These questions all point to open questions and fissures along which today’s decentralized identity community disagrees, debates and competes.  All of these are, to put it bluntly, dangers to the net-positive outcome that we all have to believe in to keep working in this emerging field– if the wrong decisions are made on any of these fives fronts, this could all turn out to be business as usual, moving fast, breaking things, and eating the [communities of] the world. Distrust anyone who hand-waves away any of the 5 and offers silver bullets and miracle cures, particularly if they also happen to be selling a product! These are all hard problems and ongoing research topics. If this were easy it wouldn’t be worth doing.</p>
