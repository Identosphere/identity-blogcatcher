<p>I listened to a very funny Podcast from Rob Long a few days ago. The main thrust being - well - <a href="https://player.fm/series/martini-shot-2869832/a-tale-of-two-larrys">listen for yourself</a>. I was talking to someone about it - and wanted to send a link - so did a search and found what I thought was the link - but it was only 4 minutes long. Rob does short, but that seemed very short.</p>
<p>Turns out I had found the story originally published in <a href="https://www.kcrw.com/culture/shows/martini-shot/the-larrys">🎙️2007</a> - the show I was looking for was the one published in <a href="https://player.fm/series/martini-shot-2869832/a-tale-of-two-larrys">🎙️2023</a>. This new version starts with the same story and then moves on to how to fix the problems in the entertainment business - which actually - as ever with Martini Shot - you can extrapolate to other industries.</p>

<p>A little foraging around the hood yesterday afternoon … some observations.</p>
<p>Going by car makes … Teslas had the most unfriendly, aggressive drivers on the road.</p>
<p>To provide context, on one occasion I was  mildly surprised when one car jumped the red lights .. red now, not amber … red, only to see a second one accelerate across right on the first car’s tail causing me to swear in shock. After a brief gap, I guess people ‘with the green’ figured it was ok to move … and they all did … only to slam on their breaks as a third car barreled through.</p>
<p>None of the three cars were Teslas … and yet Tesla still won the afternoon’s 🏆🎖️🥇</p>
<p>At the beginning of the expedition, I needed to do a ‘quick’ trip into Costco. As I left, I found myself standing in line with my receipt and cart. The Latino lady with two-children directly in front of me was definitely being ’checked’ as the ’checker’ worked around the cart accounting for each item on the list. It was maybe 7 items … 2 of which were flat packs of water bottles.</p>
<p>I had forgotten this process and had already packed my few items into a box. Watching the detailed reconciliation going on in front of me, I was just thinking about unpacking the box … when she was waved through.</p>
<p>The checker looked at me and just marked the receipt of this old, caucasian male. There was no way he knew what was in my box (X-ray eyes aside).</p>
<p>Later in the Mall, I passed a Tesla store. Back in the day, I remember lines at Tesla stores … This one was empty … other than a couple of staff … maybe all the aggressive dicks in the area already have their Tesla?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Apple Store was as full as ever. I quickly found my ‘pencil tips’ but was told I needed to ‘book an appointment’ to buy them … he clearly spotted the horror on my face …</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Or you can check yourself out.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had totally missed the sign. The process took me a whole minute. Very efficient. (I know, I know … this has been possible for the last ‘n’ years … but this was actually my first time in an Apple Store for such a minor purchase in nearly 3 1/2 years .. slack needs to be cut)</p>
<p>On my way home I stopped off at a Wholefoods to pick up dinner for the night. Inside the store was a communal eating area with a total footprint equivalent to half the store - including a bar with seats for maybe 25 people. I am sure this also is old news - but again - it’s been 3 1/2 years</p>

<p>Maybe they have been reading Rushkoff’s book - and don’t want to be put in the same bag as Peter Thiel?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was bizarre. I do get called out a lot to do these talks for businesspeople about the digital future. So, it was one of those where they paid me a bunch of money to convince me to spend some jet fuel and leave my home and pontificate, but then instead of taking me out onto the stage, they brought these five guys into the green room and sat around this table and started asking me all these very binary questions about where they should place their bets for the digital future: Bitcoin or Ethereum; VR or AR; and finally, New Zealand or Alaska—where should they invest in land to put their bunker for “the event”?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>💬 Douglas Rushkoff</p> (my bold)
<p>But still ….</p>
<p>It’s not just rich foreigners not arriving - it’s ordinary people leaving … again.</p>
<p>All kinds of reasons - but just from my own peculiarly tight Kiwi circle</p>
 
 
<p>me - of course - though I haven’t abandoned the country completely!</p>
 
 
<p>a kiwi friend and his wife moved to Portugal in January.</p>
 
 
<p>a highly networked and successful tech entrepreneur who has built his businesses in New Zealand for the last 30 years, very well connected, recognized by many for his contribution to the country has hit a wall and is looking at the US and The Far East as new opportunities. His words;</p>
 
 
<blockquote>
<p>“In New Zealand there is zero appetite in thinking beyond the shores of the country.</p>
</blockquote>
 
 an internationally successful VC who had spent the last two years in New Zealand seeking to kick start an incubator and accelerator wrote to me last week; 
 
<blockquote>
<p>My overall experience in NZ shows that it is a country that is too small and internally focused to get meaningful traction as an innovator, not impossible, just a smaller pond and appetite …. I plan to build connections in Australia and further regionally in Asian markets this year.</p>
</blockquote>
 
 a good American friend who has lived in Aotearoa for the last 8 years. Again, accomplished and connected and still can’t get local traction, yet without trying is fielding calls from Singapore, Vietnam and Malaysia. 
 
 
<p>But there’s more. COVID saw a lot of Kiwis returning ‘home’. COVID has ‘moved on’ (well - we all know it hasn’t - but it is clearly now manageable), net result, the Kiwis are back out on the road again.</p>
<p>Example - just like the UK, there is a severe shortage of healthcare professionals <a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/2022/09/06/health-workforce-crisis-needs-fresh-approach.html">just one of many articles</a> .. a shortage of 4,000 people (this in a country of 5 million people). If a similar ratio were applied to the US, there would be a shortage of over 1/4 million healthcare workers!</p>
<p>Here’s the rub … in my three years in New Zealand I lost count of trained healthcare professionals (and accountants and engineers for that matter) who were driving for taxi companies and Ola. (I am sure that the same applied to Uber - but can’t speak to that, because - well - Uber ). Why? Because New Zealand requires them to go through all their training again. (Not just pass exams - but actually retrain.)</p>
<p>Meanwhile - a Kiwi trained Healthcare professional can fly out of Auckland, land in Sydney, get paid more and have a lower cost of living.</p>
<p>There’s a lot more around the challenges that New Zealand face - which I’ll save for another day - just to leave you with a couple of quotes from Bernard Hickey - a Kiwi journalist and political commentator based in Wellington. (again - my bold.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wayne Brown is actually simply expressing a view held by most asset owners and investors in Aotearoa-NZ’s economy, or as I call it, a housing market with bits tacked on. That deeply held and and so-far-extremely-profitable investment strategy is that owning shares or investing in businesses in Aotearoa is vastly inferior to owning land, especially leveraged residential land, and even better if it is residential-zoned land that remains banked and undeveloped. The</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Wayne Brown (ed - the new major of Auckland) is being exactly what he is: a property developer who has actually made most of his personal money from land price appreciation on land made valuable through rezoning and paying for water connections at a lower-than-full cost.</p>

   YouTuber prankster shot and wounded by target of practical joke. 
 I wonder what the prank was … it doesn’t say, but watching some of the antics of these youtubers … I am not surprised that this happened. They’ve taken Candid Camera to stupid levels with zero thought for others - all in the name of ‘being a name’. Maybe  some of them will think twice going forward?

 Standards maintenance work on the core specifications 
 Fixes to the the core spec 
 
 According to reports, ActivityPub as-is is incompatible with common shared hosting environments
(e.g. typical WordPress host), as it requires HTTP content negotiation. 
 Issues backlog 
 
 A design to reduce certain loads 
 
 Reduce protocol chattiness 
 Fan-out 
 Video 
 (Not my area of expertise, so I don’t have details) 
 
 Decide on the future of ActivityPub Client-to-Server 
 
 Split the C2S spec from the S2S spec? 
 Standardize the Mastodon API instead? 
 Invest in convincing developers to implement it? 
 
 Significant extensions of the core specifications with a view on standardizing them 
 Improved security and privacy 
 
 Signed content 
 Private messages 
 
 A standardized way to express terms under which content is provided 
 
 As I understand it, Bob Wyman calls that a Rights Expression Language 
 This probably should start with a use case collection 
 
 Profiles 
 A single-document basic [Fediverse] interop spec, ie. 
 
 when I have written code for everything it says, my code will interoperate in some basic fashion with all other software that has implemented this document 
 no need to consult or understand other implementations 
 may be quite basic, e.g. text content only, only a minimal set of activity types 
 enables implementors to have a “MVP”-style interop at lowest-possible engineering effort (including the time required to read/understand the specs!) 
 This could be done as a “minimal profile” of a stack that contains a subset of AP [ActivityPub], AS [ActivityStreams], and Webfinger 
 
 Other profiles for specific use cases 
 
 E.g. propagation of event / calendar invites / RSVPs 
 
 Documentation and test 
 A test suite for the minimal profile 
 
 suitable to add to automated test suites 
 over time, this test suite can grow beyond the minimal profile 
 
 Documented behavior of leading ActivityPub implementations 
 
 What subset of the spec does each implement 
 What extensions does it implement, and which are required 
 Document the “folk wisdom” how to interact with a given implementation, so not every
new developer has to learn everything from scratch 
 Get out of “trial and error mode” when attempting to interoperate with another ActivityPub implementation 
 
 A branding program for products that have passed the test suite 
 
 As an implementor, you get to put the sticker on your product. 
 In particular, in the places in the product where users “connect” to other servers in the Fediverse, like “Visa” is displayed at the POS terminal 
 I believe this will become critical if/when larger orgs with potentially different value systems connect to the Fediverse 
 
 JSON-LD conformance 
 
 Tests to make sure implementations are JSON-LD conformant 
 
 Libraries in the major languages 
 
 Full stack, not just ActivityPub 
 
 User expectations and usability across the Fediverse 
 A set of web “intent buttons” for Like, Follow, Post, etc that work across sites 
 
 like they exist for centralized social media 
 as easy to use for the user 
 we can argue how this can be accomplished technically. I have opinions, but for this wish list, they are immaterial, as long as I get those buttons :-) 
 
 A design for search that meets the requirements of all relevant parties and points of view 
 
 This is probably far less a technical problem than one of successful communication 
 
 Best practices for content propagation 
 
 E.g. resolve the “It has 5 likes here but 10 over there” issue and related. 
 
 Improved identity management across the Fediverse 
 
 Easy-to-use single-sign-on across servers. Use case: I use several apps for different content types (like micro blog and video). Bonus: they all post from the same identifier 
 Easy-to-use persona management. Use case: I have a personal and a work account, bonus if they can be on the same server 
 Identifiers not tied to the domain name system 
 
 Attract more participants 
 
 Get major implementors involved (e.g. Mastodon) 
 Make the place where technical work is done welcome and the work pleasant

<p>I'm going to keep them going though: I've had so much value out of the habit that I don't feel it's time to stop.</p>
 The llm CLI tool 
<p>This is one new piece of software I've released in the past few weeks that I haven't written about yet.</p>
<p>I built the first version of <a>llm</a>, a command-line tool for running prompts against large language model (currently just ChatGPT and GPT-4), getting the results back on the command-line and also storing the prompt and response in a SQLite database.</p>
<p>It's still pretty experimental, but it's already looking like it will be a fun playground for trying out new things.</p>
<p>Here's the 30s version of how to start using it:</p>
 <code># Install the tool
pipx install llm
# Put an OpenAI API key somewhere it can find it
echo 'your-OpenAI-API-key' &gt; ~/.openai-api-key.txt
# Or you can set it as an environment variable:
# export OPENAI_API_KEY='...'
# Run a prompt
llm 'Ten names for cheesecakes'
</code> 
<p>This will output the response to that prompt directly to the terminal.</p>
<p>Add the <code>-s</code> or <code>--stream</code> option to stream results instead:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Prompts are run against ChatGPT's inexpensive <code>gpt-3.5-turbo</code> model by default.  You can use <code>-4</code> to run against the GPT-4 model instead (if you have access to it), or <code>--model X</code> to run against another named OpenAI model.</p>
<p>If a SQLite database file exists in <code>~/.llm/log.db</code> any prompts you run will be automatically recorded to that database, which you can then explore using <code>datasette ~/.llm/log.db</code>.</p>
<p>The following command will create that database if it does not yet exist:</p>
 <code> llm init-db
</code> 
<p>There's <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm">more in the README</a>.</p>
<p>There are plenty of other options for tools for running LLM prompts on your own machines, including some that work on the command-line and some that record your results. <code>llm</code> is probably less useful than those alternatives, but it's a fun space for me to try out new ideas.</p>
 Automating my weeknotes 
<p>I wrote at length about <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Apr/4/substack-observable/">how I automated most of my newsletter</a> using an Observable notebook and some Datasette tricks.</p>
<p>I realized the same trick could work for my weeknotes as well. The "releases this week" and "TILs this week" sections have previously been generated by hand, so I applied the same technique from the newsletter notebook to automate them as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://observablehq.com/@simonw/weeknotes">observablehq.com/@simonw/weeknotes</a> is the notebook. It fetches TILs <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/tils?sql=select%0D%0A++title%2C%0D%0A++%27https%3A%2F%2Ftil.simonwillison.net%2F%27+%7C%7C+topic+%7C%7C+%27%2F%27+%7C%7C+slug+as+url%2C%0D%0A++date%28created_utc%29+as+date%0D%0Afrom+til%0D%0A++where+created_utc+%3E%3D+date%28%27now%27%2C+%27-28+days%27%29%0D%0Aorder+by+created_utc+desc">from my TILs Datasette</a>, then grabs releases from <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simonw/simonw/main/releases.md">this page on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>It also fetches the full text of my most recent weeknotes post <a href="https://datasette.simonwillison.net/simonwillisonblog?sql=select%0D%0A++created%2C+body%0D%0Afrom%0D%0A++blog_entry%0D%0Awhere%0D%0A++id+in+%28select+entry_id+from+blog_entry_tags+where+tag_id+%3D+%28%0D%0A++++select+id+from+blog_tag+where+tag+%3D+%27weeknotes%27%0D%0A++++%29%0D%0A++%29%0D%0Aorder+by+created+desc+limit+1">from my blog's Datasette backup</a> so it can calculate which releases and TILs are new since last time.</p>
<p>It uses various regular expression and array tricks to filter that content to just the new stuff, then assembles me a markdown string which I can use as the basis of my new post.</p>
<p>Here's what that generated for me this week:</p>

   I recently started sending out a weekly-ish email newsletter consisting of content from my blog. I've mostly automated that, using an Observable Notebook to generate the HTML. Here's how that system works.

  <p>I recently started sending out <a href="https://simonw.substack.com/">a weekly-ish email newsletter</a> consisting of content from my blog. I've mostly automated that, using <a href="https://observablehq.com/@simonw/blog-to-newsletter">an Observable Notebook</a> to generate the HTML. Here's how that system works.</p>
<p></p>
 What goes in my newsletter 
<p>My blog has three types of content: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/search/?type=entry">entries</a>, <a href="https://simonwillison.net/search/?type=blogmark">blogmarks</a> and <a href="https://simonwillison.net/search/?type=quotation">quotations</a>. "Blogmarks" is a name I came up with for bookmarks <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2003/Nov/24/blogmarks/">in 2003</a>.</p>
<p>Blogmarks and quotations show up in my blog's sidebar, entries get the main column - but on mobile the three are combined into a single flow.</p>
<p>These live in a PostgreSQL database managed by Django. You can see them defined <a href="https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog/blob/main/blog/models.py">in models.py</a> in my blog's open source repo.</p>
<p>My newsletter consists of all of the new entries, blogmarks and quotations since I last sent it out. I include the entries first in reverse chronological order, since usually the entry I've just written is the one I want to use for the email subject. The blogmarks and quotations come in chronological order afterwards.</p>
<p>I'm including the full HTML for everything: people don't need to click through back to my blog to read it, all of the content should be right there in their email client.</p>
 The Substack API: RSS and copy-and-paste 
<p>Substack doesn't yet offer an API, and <a href="https://support.substack.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038433912-Does-Substack-have-an-API-">have no public plans</a> to do so.</p>
<p>They do offer an RSS feed of each newsletter though - add <code>/feed</code> to the newsletter subdomain to get it. Mine is at <a href="https://simonw.substack.com/feed">https://simonw.substack.com/feed</a>.</p>
<p>So we can get data back out again... but what about getting data in? I don't want to manually assemble a newsletter from all of these different sources of data.</p>
<p>That's where copy-and-paste comes in.</p>
<p>The Substack compose editor incorporates a well built rich-text editor. You can paste content into it and it will clean it up to fit the subset of HTML that Substack supports... but that's a pretty decent subset. Headings, paragraphs, lists, links, code blocks and images are all supported.</p>
<p>The vast majority of content on my blog fits that subset neatly.</p>
<p>Crucially, pasting in images as part of that rich text content Just Works: Substack automatically copies any images to their <code>substack-post-media</code> S3 bucket and embeds links to their CDN in the body of the newsletter.</p>
<p>So... if I can generate the intended rich-text HTML for my whole newsletter, I can copy and paste it directly into the Substack.</p>
<p>That's exactly what my new Observable notebook does: <a href="https://observablehq.com/@simonw/blog-to-newsletter">https://observablehq.com/@simonw/blog-to-newsletter</a></p>
<p>Generating HTML is a well trodden path, but I also wanted a "copy to clipboard" button that would copy the rich text version of that HTML such that pasting it into Substack would do the right thing.</p>
<p>With a bit of help from <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Interact_with_the_clipboard">MDN</a> and <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/javascript/copy-rich-text-to-clipboard">ChatGPT (my TIL)</a> I figured out the following:</p>
  function copyRichText(html) {
  const htmlContent = html;
  // Create a temporary element to hold the HTML content
  const tempElement = document.createElement("div");
  tempElement.innerHTML = htmlContent;
  document.body.appendChild(tempElement);
  // Select the HTML content
  const range = document.createRange();
  range.selectNode(tempElement);
  // Copy the selected HTML content to the clipboard
  const selection = window.getSelection();
  selection.removeAllRanges();
  selection.addRange(range);
  document.execCommand("copy");
  selection.removeAllRanges();
  document.body.removeChild(tempElement);
}  
<p>This works great! Set up a button that triggers that function and clicking that button will copy a rich text version of the HTML to the clipboard, such that pasting it directly into the Substack editor has the desired effect.</p>
 Assembling the HTML 
<p>I love using <a href="https://observablehq.com/">Observable Notebooks</a> for this kind of project: quick data integration tools that need a UI and will likely be incrementally improved over time.</p>
<p>Using Observable for these means I don't need to host anything and I can iterate my way to the right solution really quickly.</p>
<p>First, I needed to retrieve my entries, blogmarks and quotations.</p>
<p>I never built an API for my Django blog directly, but a while ago I set up a mechanism that <a href="https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog-backup/blob/main/.github/workflows/backup.yml">exports the contents</a> of my blog to <a href="https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog-backup">my simonwillisonblog-backup</a> GitHub repository for safety, and then deploys a Datasette/SQLite copy of that data to <a href="https://datasette.simonwillison.net/">https://datasette.simonwillison.net/</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a> offers a JSON API for querying that data, and exposes open CORS headers which means JavaScript running in Observable can query it directly.</p>
<p><a href="https://datasette.simonwillison.net/simonwillisonblog?sql=select+*+from+blog_entry+order+by+id+desc+limit+5">Here's an example SQL query</a> running against that Datasette instance - click the <code>.json</code> link on that page to get that data back as JSON instead.</p>
<p>My Observable notebook can then retrieve the exact data it needs to construct the HTML for the newsletter.</p>
<p>The smart thing to do would have been to retrieve the data from the API and then use JavaScript inside Observable to compose that together into the HTML for the newsletter.</p>
<p>I decided to challenge myself to doing most of the work in SQL instead, and came up with the following absolute monster of a query:</p>

<p>There are a bunch of tricks in there, but my favourite is this one:</p>
  select 'https://simonwillison.net/' || strftime('%Y/', created)
  || substr(
    'JanFebMarAprMayJunJulAugSepOctNovDec',
    (strftime('%m', created) - 1) * 3 + 1, 3
  ) ||  '/' || cast(strftime('%d', created) as integer) || '/' || slug || '/'
  as url  
<p>This is the trick I'm using to generate the URL for each entry, blogmark and quotation.</p>
<p>These are stored as datetime values in the database, but the eventual URLs look like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Apr/2/calculator-for-words/">https://simonwillison.net/2023/Apr/2/calculator-for-words/</a></p>
<p>So I need to turn that date into a YYYY/Mon/DD URL component.</p>
<p>One problem: SQLite doesn't have a date format string that produces a three letter month abbreviation. But... with cunning application of the <code>substr()</code> function and a string of all the month abbreviations I can get what I need.</p>
<p>The above SQL query plus a little bit of JavaScript provides almost everything I need to generate the HTML for my newsletter.</p>
 Excluding previously sent content 
<p>There's one last problem to solve: I want to send a newsletter containing everything that's new since my last edition - I don't want to send out the same content twice.</p>
<p>I came up with a delightfully gnarly solution to that as well.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, Substack provides an RSS feed of previous editions. I can use that data to avoid including content that's already been sent.</p>
<p>One problem: the Substack RSS feed does't include CORS headers, which means I can't access it directly from my notebook.</p>
<p>GitHub offers CORS headers for every file in every repository. I already had a repo that was backing up my blog... so why not set that to backup my RSS feed from Substack as well?</p>
<p>I <a href="https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog-backup/blob/c42b3afd6bd8cb2a4e8fa928c77426ec71552194/.github/workflows/backup.yml#L70-L74">added this</a> to my existing <code>backup.yml</code> GitHub Actions workflow:</p>
  - name: Backup Substack
  run: |-
    curl 'https://simonw.substack.com/feed' | \
      python -c "import sys, xml.dom.minidom; print(xml.dom.minidom.parseString(sys.stdin.read()).toprettyxml(indent='  '))" \
      &gt; simonw-substack-com.xml  
<p>I'm piping it through a tiny Python script here to pretty-print the XML before saving it, because pretty-printed XML is easier to read diffs against later on.</p>
<p>Now <a href="https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog-backup/blob/c42b3afd6bd8cb2a4e8fa928c77426ec71552194/simonw-substack-com.xml">simonw-substack-com.xml</a> is a copy of my RSS feed in a GitHub repo, which means I can access the data directly from JavaScript running on Observable.</p>
<p>Here's the code I wrote there to fetch that RSS feed, parse it as XML and return a string containing just the HTML of all of the posts:</p>
  previousNewsletters = {
  const response = await fetch(
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog-backup/main/simonw-substack-com.xml"
  );
  const rss = await response.text();
  const parser = new DOMParser();
  const xmlDoc = parser.parseFromString(rss, "application/xml");
  const xpathExpression = "//content:encoded";

  const namespaceResolver = (prefix) =&gt; {
    const ns = {
      content: "http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"
    };
    return ns[prefix] || null;
  };

  const result = xmlDoc.evaluate(
    xpathExpression,
    xmlDoc,
    namespaceResolver,
    XPathResult.ANY_TYPE,
    null
  );
  let node;
  let text = [];
  while ((node = result.iterateNext())) {
    text.push(node.textContent);
  }
  return text.join("\n");
}  
<p>Then I span up a regular expression to extract all of the URLs from that HTML:</p>
  previousLinks = {
  const regex = /(?:"|&amp;quot;)(https?:\/\/[^\s"&lt;&gt;]+)(?:"|&amp;quot;)/g;
  return Array.from(previousNewsletters.matchAll(regex), (match) =&gt; match[1]);
}  
<p>Added a "skip existing" toggle checkbox to my notebook:</p>
  viewof skipExisting = Inputs.toggle({
  label: "Skip content sent in prior newsletters"
})  
<p>And added this code to filter the raw content based on whether or not the toggle was selected:</p>
  content = skipExisting
  ? raw_content.filter(
      (e) =&gt;
        !previousLinks.includes(e.url) &amp;&amp;
        !previousLinks.includes(e.external_url)
    )
  : raw_content  
<p>The <code>url</code> is the URL to the post on my blog. <code>external_url</code> is the URL to the original source of the blogmark or quotation. A match against ether of those should exclude the content from my next newsletter.</p>
 My workflow for sending a newsletter 
<p>Given all of the above, sending a newsletter out is hardly any work at all:</p>
 
 Ensure the most recent backup of my blog has run, such that the Datasette instance contains my latest content. I do that by <a href="https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog-backup/actions/workflows/backup.yml">triggering this action</a>. 
 Navigate to <a href="https://observablehq.com/@simonw/blog-to-newsletter">https://observablehq.com/@simonw/blog-to-newsletter</a> - select "Skip content sent in prior newsletters" and then click the "Copy rich text newsletter to clipboard" button. 
 Navigate to the Substack "publish" interface and paste that content into the rich text editor. 
 Pick a title and subheading, and maybe add a bit of introductory text. 
 Preview it. If the preview looks good, hit "send". 
 
<p></p>
 Copy and paste APIs 
<p>I think copy and paste is under-rated as an API mechanism.</p>
<p>There are no rate limits or API keys to worry about.</p>
<p>It's supported by almost every application, even ones that are resistant to API integrations.</p>
<p>It even works great on mobile phones, especially if you include a "copy to clipboard" button.</p>
<p>My <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-copyable">datasette-copyable</a> plugin for Datasette is one of my earlier explorations of this. It makes it easy to copy data out of Datasette in a variety of useful formats.</p>
<p>This Observable newsletter project has further convinced me that the clipboard is an under-utilized mechanism for building tools to help integrate data together in creative ways.</p>

When Twitter changed hands last November I switched to Mastodon; ever since I’ve enjoyed happier and more productive social networking. To enhance my happiness and productivity I began working on a Mastodon plugin for <a href="https://steampipe.io">Steampipe</a>. My initial goal was to study the fediverse writ large. Which people and which servers are powerful connectors? How do moderation policies work? What’s it like to join a small server versus a large one? These are important questions, and you can use the plugin to begin to answer them. But I soon realized that as a newcomer to a scene that’s been evolving for six years, and has not welcomed such analysis, I should start by looking for ways to enhance the experience of reading Mastodon. So I began building a set of <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-mastodon-insights">dashboards</a> that augment the stock Mastodon client or (my preference) <a href="https://elk.zone">elk.zone</a>. And I’ve narrated that project in a series of posts.</p>
<p>
Last week we released the plugin to <a href="https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/mastodon">the Steampipe hub</a>. If you’ve <a href="https://steampipe.io/downloads">installed Steampipe</a>, you can now get the plugin using steampipe plugin install mastodon. The next phases of this project will explore using the plugin and dashboards in <a href="https://cloud.steampipe.io">Steampipe Cloud</a>, and speeding up the dashboards by means of persistent Postgres tables and Steampipe Cloud snapshots. Meanwhile, here’s a recap of what I’ve learned thus far.</p>
 See more with less distraction 
<p>
While the dashboards use charts and relationship graphs, they are mainly tables of query results. Because Steampipe dashboards don’t (yet) render HTML, these views display plain text only — no images, no styled text. I’ve embraced this constraint, and I find it valuable in two ways. First, I’m able to scan many more posts at a glance than is possible in conventional clients, and more effectively choose which to engage with. When I described this effect to a friend he said: “It’s a <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3684669/a-bloomberg-terminal-for-mastodon.html">Bloomberg terminal</a> for Mastodon!” As those of us who rode the first wave of the blogosphere will recall, RSS readers were a revelation for the same reason.</p>
<p>
Second, I find that the absence of images and styled text has a <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3686515/images-considered-harmful-sometimes.html">calming effect</a>. To maintain a healthy information diet you need to choose sources wisely but, no matter where you go, sites deploy a barrage of attention-grabbing devices. I find dialing down the noise helpful, for the same reason that I often switch my phone to monochrome mode. Attention is our scarcest resource; the fewer distractions, the better.</p>
<p>
There’s a tradeoff, of course; sometimes an image is the entire point of a post. So while I often read Mastodon using these Steampipe dashboards, I also use Elk directly. The Steampipe dashboards work alongside conventional Mastodon clients, and indeed depend on them: I click through from the dashboards to Elk in order to boost, reply, or view images. That experience is enhanced by <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3686115/instance-qualified-mastodon-urls.html">instance-qualified URLS</a> that translate foreign URLs to ones that work on your home server.</p>
 Manage people and lists 
<p>
The ability to assign people to lists, and read in a list-oriented way, is a handy Twitter affordance that I never used much because it was easy to let the algorithms govern my information diet. Because Mastodon doesn’t work like that, lists have become the primary way I read the fediverse flow. Of the 800+ people I follow so far, I’ve assigned more than half to lists with titles like *Climate* and *Energy* and *Software*. To help me do that, several dashboards report how many of the people I follow are assigned to lists (or not).</p>
<p>
I want as many people on lists as possible. So I periodically review the people I follow, put unassigned people on lists, and track the ratio of people who are, or aren’t, on lists. Here’s the <a href="https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/mastodon/tables/mastodon_list_account#count-how-many-of-the-accounts-i-follow-are-assigned-and-not-assigned-to-lists">query</a> for that.</p>
 with list_account as (
  select
    a.id,
    l.title as list
  from
    mastodon_my_list l
    join mastodon_list_account a on l.id = a.list_id
),
list_account_follows as (
  select
    list
  from
    mastodon_my_following
    left join list_account using (id)
)
select 'follows listed' as label, count(*) from list_account_follows where list is not null
union
select 'follows unlisted' as label, count(*) from list_account_follows where list is null
 
<p>
When you read in a list-oriented away, as is also true when you read by following hashtags, there are always people whose chattiness becomes a distraction. To control that I’ve implemented the following rule: show at most one original toot per person per list per day. Will I miss some things this way? Sure! But if you’ve said something that resonates with other people, I’m likely to hear about it from someone else. It’s a tradeoff that’s working well for me so far.</p>
<p>
Here’s the <a href="https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/mastodon/tables/mastodon_toot_list#get-recent-original-toots-on-a-lists-timeline-at-most-one-per-person-per-day">SQL implementation</a> of the rule.</p>
 with data as (
  select
    list_id,
    to_char(created_at, 'YYYY-MM-DD') as day,
    case
      when display_name = '' then username
      else display_name
    end as person,
    instance_qualified_url as url,
    substring(content from 1 for 200) as toot
  from
    mastodon_toot_list
  where
    list_id = '42994'
    and reblog is null -- only original posts
    and in_reply_to_account_id is null -- only original posts
  limit
    40
)
select
  distinct on (person, day) -- only one per person per day
  day,
  person,
  toot,
  url
from
  data
order by
  day desc,
  person;
 
<p>
On the home timeline’s dashboard I’ve made it optional to include or hide boosts, which can be the majority of items. On the list-reading dashboard I’ve opted to always exclude them, but the SQL idiom for doing so — select distinct on (person, day) — is simple, easy to understand, and easy to change.</p>
 Visualize relationships 
<p>
I’ve so far found three ways in which <a href="https://steampipe.io/blog/release-0-18-0">relationship graphs</a> can make Mastodon more legible. First, in <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3686528/mastodon-relationship-graphs.html">Mastodon relationship graphs</a>, I showed how to use SQL-defined <a href="https://steampipe.io/docs/reference/mod-resources/node">nodes</a> and <a href="https://steampipe.io/docs/reference/mod-resources/edge">edges</a> to show boost relationships among people and servers. In <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3688937/mapping-people-and-tags-on-mastodon.html">another article</a> I used the same tools to map relationships among people and tags. And <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3690268/visualizing-mastodon-server-moderation.html">most recently</a> I used them to explore server-to-server moderation. </p>
<p>
In all three cases the format conveys information not directly available from tabular views. Clusters of interesting people pop out, as do people who share tags. And when I graphed servers that block other servers I discovered an unexpected category: some servers that block others are themselves also blocked, like infosec.exchange in this example.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://jonudell.info/images/blocked-and-blocking.jpg"><br>
  <br>
</a></p>
<p>
The Steampipe combo of <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3648648/how-sql-can-unify-access-to-apis.html">SQL-oriented API access</a> and <a href="https://steampipe.io/blog/dashboards-as-code">dashboards as code</a> is a uniquely productive way to build relationship graphs that can unlock insights in any domain. As we’ve seen with <a href="https://steampipe.io/blog/k8s-insights">Kubernetes</a>, they can help make cloud infrastructure more legible. The Mastodon graphs suggest that the same can happen in the social networking realm. </p>
 Use RSS feeds 
<p>
When you append .rss to the URL of a Mastodon account, or tag, you produce an RSS feed like <a href="https://mastodon.social/@judell.rss">https://mastodon.social/@judell.rss</a> or <a href="https://mastodon.social/tags/steampipe.rss">https://mastodon.social/tags/steampipe.rss</a>. These feeds provide a kind of auxiliary API that includes data not otherwise available from the primary API: related tags, which appear in the feeds as RSS category elements. Steampipe really shines here thanks to the <a href="https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/rss">RSS plugin</a> which enables joins with the primary Mastodon API. This query augments items in account’s feed with tags that appear in each item.</p>
 with data as (
  select
    name,
    url || '.rss' as feed_link
  from
    mastodon_search_hashtag
  where
    query = $1,
    and name = query
  limit 
)
select
  to_char(r.published, 'YYYY-MM-DD') as published,
  d.name as tag,
  (
    select string_agg(trim(JsonString::text, '"'), ', ')
    from jsonb_array_elements(r.categories) JsonString
  ) as categories,
  r.guid as link,
  ( select content as toot from mastodon_search_toot where query = r.guid ) as content
from
  data d
join
  rss_item r
on
  r.feed_link = d.feed_link
order by
  r.published desc
limit 10
 
<p>
A similar query drives the graph discussed in <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2023/02/26/mapping-people-and-tags-on-mastodon/">Mapping people and tags on Mastodon</a>. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://jonudell.info/images/tag-graph.png"><br>
  <br>
</a></p>
<p>
In that example, surfacing the connection between a user, @themarkup, and a pair of tags, scotus and section230, was useful in two ways. First, it helped me instantly spot the item that I most wanted to read, which was buried deep in the search results. Second, it helped me discover a source that I’ll return to for guidance on similar topics. Of course I added that source to my Law list!</p>
 Own the algorithm 
<p>
Everyone who comes to Mastodon appreciates not having an adversarial algorithm control what they see in their timelines. Most of us aren’t opposed to algorithmic influence per se, though, we just don’t like the adversarial nature of it. How can we build algorithms that work with us, not against us? We’ve already seen one example: the list-reading dashboard displays just one item per list per person per day. That’s a policy that I was able to define, and easily implement, with Steampipe. And in fact I adjusted it after using it for a while. The original policy was hourly, that was too chatty, so I switched to daily by making a trivial change to the SQL query. </p>
<p>
In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2023/02/14/news-in-the-fediverse/">News in the fediverse</a> I showed another example. The Mastodon server press.coop aggregates feeds from mainstream news sources. I was happy to have those feeds, but I didn’t want to see those news items mixed in with my home timeline. Rather, I wanted to assign them to a News list and read them only when I visit that list in a news-reading mindset. The fediverse offers an opportunity to reboot the social web and gain control of our information diets. Since our diets all differ, it ought to be possible — and even easy — for anyone to turn on a rule like *news only on lists, not timelines*. Steampipe can make it so.</p>
 Steampipe as component 
<p>
When you ask people on Mastodon about these kinds of features, the response is often “Have you tried client X? It offers feature Y.” But that solution doesn’t scale. It would require massive duplication of effort for every client to implement every such policy; meanwhile, people don’t want to switch to client X just for feature Y (which might entail losing feature Z). Could policies be encapsulated and made available to any Mastodon client? It’s interesting to think about Steampipe as a <a href="https://steampipe.io/blog/steampipe-as-component">component</a> that delivers that encapsulation. A timeline built by SQL queries, and governed by SQL-defined policies, is a resource available to any app that can connect to Postgres, either locally or in Steampipe Cloud. </p>
<p>
If you’re curious about the Steampipe + Mastodon combo, install the <a href="https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/steampipe-plugin-mastodon">plugin</a>, try out the sample queries, then clone the <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-mastodon-insights">mod</a> and check out the dashboards. Do they usefully augment your Mastodon reader? What would improve them? Can you use these ingredients to invent your own customized Mastodon experience?

<p>最初は「OpenAI, ChatGPTへのイタリアからのアクセスをブロック開始」とのタイトルの記事でしたが、今後色々と動きがありそうなので、このエントリにまとめて追記していくことにします。ですので、随時時間付きでアップデートしていきます。</p>



 



<p>2023-04-03 13:49</p>



 OpenAI, ChatGPTへのイタリアからのアクセスをブロック開始 



<p>先日の命令<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/04/5254/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-5254" title="<a href=&quot;https://www.sakimura.org/2023/04/5220/&quot; data-type=&quot;URL&quot; data-id=&quot;https://www.sakimura.org/2023/04/5220/&quot;>「伊プライバシー当局、ChatGPTにイタリアのユーザの情報の取扱いの即時制限を命令」</a>">1</a>）をうけて、欧州で月曜日がスタートする前に、OpenAI社はChatGPTへのイタリアからのアクセスをブロック開始<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/04/5254/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-5254" title="Gigazine: OpenAIがイタリアからのChatGPTへのアクセスをブロック &amp;lt;<a href=&quot;https://gigazine.net/news/20230403-openai-geoblocks-chatgpt-italy/&quot;>https://gigazine.net/news/20230403-openai-geoblocks-chatgpt-italy/</a>&amp;gt;">2</a>したようです。</p>



<p>感想：そりゃそうですよねぇ。事実は明らかであり、命令に従わないと、EU Rep が３ヶ月間以上の禁錮ですから。</p>



 イタリアの大臣が「ChatGPTへのBanは過剰である」との発言 



<p>イタリアの大臣が「ChatGPTへのBanは過剰である」との発言もしたようです<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/04/5254/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-5254" title="Reuiter:&amp;#8221;Italian minister says country&amp;#8217;s ban on ChatGPT is excessive&amp;#8221; &amp;lt;<a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/technology/italian-minister-says-countrys-ban-chatgpt-is-excessive-2023-04-02/&quot;>https://www.reuters.com/technology/italian-minister-says-countrys-ban-chatgpt-is-excessive-2023-04-02/</a>&amp;gt;">3</a>。</p>



<p>感想：大臣が何か言ったからと言って態度を変えると独立性を問われるので、それはそれで個人情報保護当局としてはムズい展開ではありますね。</p>



 



<p>2023-04-03 16:30</p>



 ChatGPTが禁止されたイタリア向けに「PizzaGPT」が爆誕 



<p>ChatGPTへのブロックが始まったことを受けて、それを迂回する PizzaGPTというものが出てきたようです。</p>



 
 <a href="https://softantenna.com/blog/pizzagpt/">ChatGPTが禁止されたイタリア向けに「PizzaGPT」が爆誕</a> 



 <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35405760">PizzaGPT – ChatGPT clone accessible from Italy</a> 
 



<p>「Nuxt 3、Tailwind、DaisyUIを使用し、OpenAI completions APIのラッパー/チャットインターフェイスを実装したもの」とのことです。</p>



<p>感想：これでは残念ながら抜け穴にしかなってないようにおもわれます。アクセスが増えるのをさばくためにPizza１枚分のお金を寄付してほしいということのようですが、まぁ、OpenAIが年齢認証やデータ利用オプトアウトをメインの動線に入れるなど、今回指示されたことを実装するまでのつなぎだけをやる一時的システムだからそれで、ということかもしれません。独自に年齢認証やります、自動でデータ利用オプトアウトします、というのなら面白いですけどね。もちろんそれだけでは、トレーニングデータにイタリア人のデータが含まれていた問題は解決しないわけですが、少なくとも新規の学習はされなくなるなどの効果があり、多分そのあたりがGarante<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/04/5254/#easy-footnote-bottom-4-5254" title="イタリアの個人情報保護当局">4</a>とOpenAI社の落とし所になるんじゃないかなぁとは思うのですが（←単なる個人の感想です）。</p>



 



<p>2023-04-05 22:23</p>



 ChatGPTへのアクセスをブロックしたイタリアに続きドイツなどEU諸国でもブロックを検討中 



<p>イタリアに続き、ドイツ他も同様の命令を検討中のようです。</p>

 Italy’s ChatGPT ban attracts EU privacy regulators | Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/germany-principle-could-block-chat-gpt-if-needed-data-protection-chief-2023-04-03/">https://www.reuters.com/technology/germany-principle-could-block-chat-gpt-if-needed-data-protection-chief-2023-04-03/</a> 
 



<p>感想：まぁ、イタリアの命令がGDPRにもとづいてであったので、同様の命令が他のEU加盟国から出なかったらむしろ驚きですよね。</p>

  <p>One of the most pervasive mistakes I see people using with large language model tools like ChatGPT is trying to use them as a search engine.</p>
<p>As with <a href="https://simonwillison.net/series/llm-misconceptions/">other LLM misconceptions</a>, it's easy to understand why people do this.</p>
<p>If you ask an LLM a question, it will answer it - no matter what the question! Using them as an alternative to a search engine such as Google is one of the most obvious applications - and for a lot of queries this works just fine.</p>
<p>It's also going to quickly get you into trouble.</p>
<p>Ted Chiang's classic essay <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/chatgpt-is-a-blurry-jpeg-of-the-web">ChatGPT Is a Blurry JPEG of the Web</a> helps explain why:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Think of ChatGPT as a blurry jpeg of all the text on the Web. It retains much of the information on the Web, in the same way that a jpeg retains much of the information of a higher-resolution image, but, if you’re looking for an exact sequence of bits, you won’t find it; all you will ever get is an approximation. But, because the approximation is presented in the form of grammatical text, which ChatGPT excels at creating, it’s usually acceptable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ChatGPT model is huge, but it's not huge enough to retain every exact fact it's encountered in its training set.</p>
<p>It can produce a convincing answer to anything, but that doesn't mean it's reflecting actual facts in its answers. You always have to stay skeptical and fact check what it tells you.</p>
<p>Language models are also famous for "hallucinating" - for inventing new facts that fit the sentence structure despite having no basis in the underlying data.</p>
<p>There are plenty of "facts" about the world which humans disagree on. Regular search lets you compare those versions and consider their sources. A language model might instead attempt to calculate some kind of average of every opinion it's been trained on - which is sometimes what you want, but often is not.</p>
<p>This becomes even more obvious when you consider smaller language models. <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Mar/11/llama/">LLaMA 7B</a> can be represented as a 3.9 GB file - it contains an astonishing amount of information, but evidently that's not enough storage space to accurately answer every question you might have.</p>
<p>So if they're not reliable for use as a search engines, what are LLMs even good for?</p>
 A calculator for words 
<p>I like to think of language models like ChatGPT as a calculator for words.</p>
<p>This is reflected in their name: a "language model" implies that they are tools for working with language. That's what they've been trained to do, and it's language manipulation where they truly excel.</p>
<p>Want them to work with specific facts? Paste those into the language model as part of your original prompt!</p>
<p>There are so many applications of language models that fit into this calculator for words category:</p>
 
 Summarization. Give them an essay and ask for a summary. 
 Question answering: given these paragraphs of text, answer this specific question about the information they represent. 
 Fact extraction: ask for bullet points showing the facts presented by an article. 
 Rewrites: reword things to be more "punchy" or "professional" or "sassy" or "sardonic" - part of the fun here is using increasingly varied adjectives and seeing what happens. They're very good with language after all! 
 Suggesting titles - actually a form of summarization. 
 World's most effective thesaurus. "I need a word that hints at X", "I'm very Y about this situation, what could I use for Y?" - that kind of thing. 
 Fun, creative, wild stuff. Rewrite this in the voice of a 17th century pirate. What would a sentient cheesecake think of this? How would Alexander Hamilton rebut this argument? Turn this into a rap battle. Illustrate this business advice with an anecdote about sea otters running a kayak rental shop. Write the script for kickstarter fundraising video about this idea. 
 
<p>A calculator for words is an incredibly powerful thing.</p>
 They can be hooked up to search engines 
<p>Here's where things get a bit complicated: some language models CAN work as search engines. The two most obvious are Microsoft Bing and Google Bard, but there are plenty of other examples of this pattern too - there's even an alpha feature of ChatGPT called "browsing mode" that can do this.</p>
<p>You can think of these search tools as augmented language models.</p>
<p>The way these work is the language model identifies when a search might help answer a question... and then runs that search through an attached search engine, via an API.</p>
<p>It then copies data from the search results back into itself as part of an invisible prompt, and uses that new context to help it answer the original question.</p>
<p>It's effectively the same thing as if you ran a search, then copied and pasted information back into the language model and asked it a question about that data.</p>
<p>I wrote about how to implement this pattern against your own data in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Jan/13/semantic-search-answers/">How to implement Q&amp;A against your documentation with GPT3, embeddings and Datasette</a>. It's an increasingly common pattern.</p>
<p>It's important to note that there is still a risk of hallucination here, even when you feed it the facts you want it to use. I've caught both Bing and Bard adding made-up things in the middle of text that should have been entirely derived from their search results!</p>
 Using language models effectively is deceptively difficult 
<p>So many of the challenges involving language models come down to this: they look much, much easier to use than they actually are.</p>
<p>To get the most value out of them - and to avoid the many traps that they set for the unwary user - you need to spend time with them, and work to build an accurate mental model of how they work, what they are capable of and where they are most likely to go wrong.</p>
<p>I hope this "calculator for words" framing can help.</p>
 A flaw in this analogy: calculators are repeatable 
<p><a href="https://waxy.org/">Andy Baio</a> pointed out a flaw in this particular analogy: calculators always give you the same answer for a given input. Language models don't - if you run the same prompt through a LLM several times you'll get a slightly different reply every time.</p>
<p>This is a very good point! You should definitely keep this in mind.</p>
<p>All analogies are imperfect, but some are more imperfect that others.</p>

<p>While discussing ChatGPT with my teenage grandkids, I put it to a number of tests. In one I asked it to write a poem that includes all the capital cities in the U.S. Here is its reply:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<blockquote><p>From sea to shining sea, Across this land so grand, The capitals of every state, Await us to take a stand.</p>
<p>In Montgomery, Alabama, We begin our noble quest, To climb each statehouse staircase, And put our wills to the test.</p>
<p>Through Juneau, Alaska, To Phoenix, Arizona’s heat, The halls of power beckon us, With challenges we must meet.</p>

<p>In Annapolis, Maryland, And Massachusetts’ Boston town, We’ll seek to find our purpose, And rise to wear the crown.</p>
<p>Lansing, Michigan, And St. Paul’s Minnesota pride, We’ll climb each capital’s staircase, And never be denied.</p>
<p>Mississippi’s Jackson town, And Jefferson City’s Missouri call, We’ll cross this land with honor, And never falter or fall.</p>
<p>Helena, Montana’s heights, And Lincoln’s Nebraska plains, We’ll march through every capital, And honor each state’s gains.</p>
<p>Carson City, Nevada, And Concord’s New Hampshire pride, We’ll stand in every statehouse, And let our voices be our guide.</p>
<p>Trenton’s New Jersey call, And Santa Fe’s New Mexico sun, We’ll climb the stairs of governance, And learn from everyone.</p>
<p>Albany’s New York pride, And Raleigh’s North Carolina charm, We’ll honor every state’s glory, And never let it harm.</p>

 Since Elon’s acquisition of Twitter, the “Fediverse” has become a thing. A thing that
many people talk about, often in nebolous terms. I think we need to be more precise,
and to do that, it might be helpful to distinguish several parts of the Fediverse. 
 I believe the primary components of the Fediverse are the following, best shown

<p>Since Elon’s acquisition of Twitter, the “Fediverse” has become a thing. A thing that
many people talk about, often in nebolous terms. I think we need to be more precise,
and to do that, it might be helpful to distinguish several parts of the Fediverse.</p>
<p>I believe the primary components of the Fediverse are the following, best shown
as a layered architecture:</p>
 
 
  
   
    <p>People</p><p>
    </p><p>You and me; sometimes companies</p>
   
  
  
   
    <p>Apps</p>
    <p>e.g. Mastodon, PeerTube</p>
   
  
  
   
    <p>Network</p>
    <p>ActivityPub (and related protocols)</p>
   
  
 
 
<p>To summarize this diagram: there is a communications network (at the bottom), over which
apps can communicate with each other (middle), enabling people to interact with each other
in various ways (top).</p>
<p>Have you noticed that when people talk about the Fediverse …</p>
 
 … sometimes they mean the network, as in: “all these apps can talk to each other because
it’s all ActivityPub” … 
 … and sometimes they mean people, as in: “We have genuine relationships with each other
in the Fediverse because no 3rd party inserts ads and addictive algorithms”? 
 And of course, when they use “Mastodon” as the term instead of “Fediverse”, that’s
because in this view, the Fediverse is primary formed by thousands of app
instances, most of which today are Mastodon instances. 
 
<p>This distinction is very important, because the properties of the “Fediverse” in the
various definitions, are quite different. For example:</p>
 
 
<p>If I think the Fediverse is all about people, and how they relate to each other,
I don’t really care whether it’s based on ActivityPub, or other protocols (like
SSB, or Bluesky, or Webmention, or …) or any combination. In this view, the Fediverse
is a “place” where certain social norms are different, including that certain behaviors
prevalent in society or in other social networks (like expressions of racism) are
frowned upon or grounds for blocking.</p>
 
 
<p>If I think the Fediverse is the set of all software nodes that communicate over ActivityPub,
then I’m baffled why anybody should think some of those nodes shouldn’t be bots,
or publish advertisements or special offers; ActivityPub can carry all of those and
more. In this view, in its extreme form, the Fediverse could ultimately encompass
a lot of internet communication infrastructure, including replacing SMTP for
“e-mail”, for example.</p>
 
 
<p>Because of this confusion, sometimes the term “Fediverse” is actually less than helpful.
On the other hand, there isn’t an obviously better term (or several; we need several).</p>
<p>In my personal view, the network/interop-centric definition of Fediverse is more useful: the
Fediverse is the set of all nodes that can communicate semantically with each other through
common protocols (ActivityPub).</p>
<p>Given this, it allows many new apps to be built that
connect to the same network – the Fediverse – creating lots of new value, as I
<a href="https://reb00ted.org/tech/20230322-open-networks-are-more-valuable-fediverse/">described earlier</a>.</p>
<p>And those in turn enable people with common values to find each other, and form communities,
that practice forms of interaction that would be much harder on centralized social media
platforms. To use but one example, my primary Fediverse account is hosted
by <a href="https://social.coop/">social.coop</a>, a member-owned cooperative that formed for the
purpose of hosting a social media server that works for them; self-funded, self-governed.
Imagine that outside of the Fediverse!</p>
<p>But regardless of what the term “Fediverse” is ultimately going to end up meaning,
whether that’s my preference or some other interpretation, let’s not conflate these different
ideas, otherwise all the beautiful opportunities created by the Fediverse to communicate
with each other won’t help us avoid talking past each other about the very thing that
makes it possible to talk!</p>

There's a <a href="https://flux.community/matthew-sheffield/2023/04/big-business-and-government-are-adopting-artificial-intelligence-what-can-it-do-for-the-rest-of-us/">transcript on the site</a> which includes additional links.</p>
<p>I'll quote one portion from towards the end of the interview, about ways to learn more about how to use these models:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>WILLISON: Websites pop up every day that claim to help you with AI, to be honest, at a rate that’s too far to even evaluate them and figure out which ones are good and which ones are snake oil. The thing that matters is actually interacting with these systems. You should be playing with Google Bard, and ChatGPT, and Microsoft Bing, and trying things out with a very skeptical approach.</p>
<p>Always assume that anything that it does, it could be making things up. It could be tricking you into thinking that it’s capable of something that it’s not. But that’s where you have to learn to experiment. You have to try different things, give it a URL, and then give it a broken URL and see how it differs between them.</p>
<p>Because that really is the most reliable way to get stuff done here. To sort of build that crucial mental model of what these things can do, and what they can’t. And it’s full of pitfalls. It’s so easy to fall into traps. So you do need to read around this stuff and find communities of people who are experimenting in it with, with you and, and so on.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I don’t think there’s an easy answer to the question yet of how to learn to use these effectively, partly because ChatGPT isn’t even four months old yet. It’s four-month birthday’s on the 30th of March. All of this stuff is so new, we’re all figuring it out together. The key thing is, because it’s all so new, you need to hang out with other people.</p>
<p>You need to get involved with communities who are figuring this out. Share what you learn, see what other people learn, and basically try and help society as a whole come to terms with what these things even are and what we can do with them.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>So that’s, I think, one of my sort of big personal ethical concerns is you should share your prompts. There are websites where you can sell prompts to people. No, no, no, no. Don’t do that. Share your prompts with other people. You get them to share the prompts back. We are all in this together. And sharing the prompts that work for you and the prompts that don’t is the fastest way that you can learn, and the fastest way that you can help other people learn as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A shorter version of the above: share your prompts!  We're all in this together. We have so much that we still need to figure out.</p>

  It is time for USG to actively deploy shared identity services in the public interest

<p>The U.S. Federal Government has spent a considerable amount of time, treasure and energy admiring the problem of shared digital identity infrastructure that can be used by individuals in a privacy respecting manner, while improving cybersecurity and streamlining access to online services and benefits. It is time for it to occupy the room it owns instead of outsourcing solutions to private sector entities who do not have the public interest at heart.</p>

<p></p>



<p>The above graphic provides an easy to understand conceptual breakdown of the various components that make up a shared digital identity infrastructure.</p>

<p>I’ve updated some of the terminology to this decade, but the components and their relationships are taken directly from the U.S. Federal Identity, Credential and Access Management <a href="https://blog.aniljohn.com/2013/12/ficam-tfs-component-identity-services.html" title="FICAM TFS Component Identity Services Terminology">(FICAM) Program’s Trust Framework Solutions (TFS) Component Identity Terminology</a> circa 2013.</p>

<p>Using the TFS terminology that provides separation of concerns and capabilities, the question now becomes who within the U.S. Federal Government is best able to manage and operate these services?</p>

 GSA’s Login.gov as the Authentication Provider 

<p>In the aftermath of the GSA IG report that <a href="https://www.gsaig.gov/content/gsa-misled-customers-logingovs-compliance-digital-identity-standards" title="GSA Misled Customers on Login.gov’s Compliance with Digital Identity Standards">“GSA Misled Customers on Login.gov’s Compliance with Digital Identity Standards”</a>, and as I fully expected, there are a set of private sector identity service providers and their champions who have come out with variations of the narrative that “.gov should not be trusted to run a shared identity service” and should instead use their services, or that the “money that is allocated to Login.gov should be taken away” and re-programmed for other uses.</p>

<p>I am, oddly enough, here to make a case for why continued investment in and expansion of the Login.gov program is in the public interest. Odd because, I am on record as being Not-a-Fan of Login.gov’s remote identity proofing implementation because it was and is using data-broker transactional data instead of anything authoritative, and because of their weasel-worded support for NIST 800-63-3 Identity Assurance Levels (IALs).</p>

<p>My perspective on the GSA IG report is that it is a clear demonstration of exactly why .gov should run these types of services — because it demonstrates the independent checks and balances set up within Agencies working … and working well.</p>

<p>Can anyone point me to an example in the private sector where an Organization self-identified the problem, and corrected it with this high degree of transparency and accountability?</p>

<p>So let me stay on brand by noting that it is directly within the competency and capability of GSA and Login.gov to focus on Authentication (AAL) and Federation (FAL) Assurance Level’s and get out of the Identity Assurance Level (IAL) business.</p>

<p>In the near term, the conceptual picture of this could look something like this:</p>

<p></p>

<p>The Agency remains responsible for the remote identity proofing and can use its internal data or other data sources it has access to, in order to accomplish it, but its use of Login.gov as the Authentication provider eases the burdens that are placed on individuals interacting with the Agency’s services, which should be a priority of any Agency!</p>

<p>I am semi-amused to note that this would enable us to catch up, after many long years, <a href="https://blog.aniljohn.com/2014/10/c2g-identity-services-overview-canada.html" title="A C2G Identity Services Overview of Canada">to what the Canadian Federal Government have effectively been doing at population scale for a LONG time!</a></p>

<p>However, this is only the first step, as it is just as important to implement a shared identity validation service that can be utilized by Agencies to mitigate account opening fraud, benefits fraud, and synthetic identity fraud.</p>

 Say No to Match/No-Match 

<p>While supporting the intent of such services, I also believe that it is a <a href="https://www.cyberforge.com/not-better-identity/" title="Not better identity">REALLY BAD IDEA to implement these validation services using a “match/no-match” or “yes/no” architecture</a> because it:</p>

 
   Implements a “phone home” capability that can be abused 
   Limits the ability to collect informed consent from an individual about the use of their data 
   Can be abused by databrokers to enhance their targeting, profiling and segmentation of individuals 
 

<p><a href="https://www.cyberforge.com/not-better-identity/" title="Not better identity">My linked article</a> goes into the details and closed with a note that with the advances in understanding of the pitfalls of the private sector ecosystem as well as progress that has been made on global technical standards that ensure interoperability, security, privacy and choice, there is another way to implement this capability that can mitigate and/or eliminate the issues noted above.</p>

 Future&nbsp;» .gov W3C VC Broker for Authoritative Data Sources 

<p>That way is to enable an individual to have agency and control in interacting with authoritative sources that contain information about them, and giving them the capability to obtain and then present that information in a trustworthy and privacy respecting manner to entities they wish to interact with.</p>

<p>This will require the implementation of a shared service W3C Verifiable Credentials Broker Service that acts as the gateway to multiple authoritative sources within the Government. The individual directly interacts with those sources in order to obtain licenses, permits, credentials and attestations that they in turn can use in any online transactions – both with the Government and with the private sector!</p>

<p>The model for this would look like this:</p>

<p></p>

<p>What is important to understand about this model is that the “.gov Shared W3C VC Broker” is not by itself an authoritative issuer, but instead is a gateway/broker/UI implementation that acts as the front-end for multiple, independent authoritative issuers of W3C Verifiable Credentials.</p>

<p>Think that is too far out there?</p>

<p>I don’t believe it is, since I can point you to the <a href="https://playground.chapi.io/issuer">multi-vendor, multi-issuer, multi-party interoperability implementation environment that is being operationally tested by the W3C Verifiable Credential and W3C Decentralized Identifier community</a> to see a working example of this model:</p>

<p></p>

<p>What you see above is a gateway/broker that is a very light-weight facade over 6 different credential issuers, that an individual can interact with in order to obtain one or more W3C Verifiable Credentials.</p>

<p>The same approach can serve as a starting point for a .gov service; for a moment, swap out the credentials shown above with credentials that could be generated from the following authoritative data sources:</p>
 
   Passport Information (State Department) 
   Immigration/Employment Eligibility Status (USCIS) 
   Tax Records (IRS) 
   Social Benefit Eligibility (SSA) 
   Birth/Death Records (State Vital Records Agency) 
   Driver Eligibility and State Residency (State DMVs) 
   Address of Record (USPS) 
   … 
 

<p>Also consider that as the individual is directly interacting with the service, receiving a credential, and then they (and not the Government) are using it (as they already do now in the paper world) for a variety of interactions that the Government may not be party to, it is not triggering .gov considerations related to Government use of that data since the Government has no visibility or awareness of the use of that data by the individual i.e. no “phone home” issues!</p>

<p>As an aside, if you were to ask me who should operate such a W3C VC Broker service for the U.S. Government, my answer would be the U.S. Postal Service, for a variety of very good reasons! <a href="https://www.usps.com/international/passports.htm">Hint: If you are a U.S. Citizen, how did you apply for the highest value citizen facing credential issued by the U.S. Federal Government?</a></p>

 Enable individuals, not databrokers! 

<p>I am not a believer or supporter of a Government issued identity card, but I do believe that Government has a role in standing behind and vouching for information it is authoritative for, when requested by an individual.</p>

<p>This architectural model provides the ability to do just that, while supporting individual agency, control and consent of the individual regarding their information, and puts digital identity within the U.S. Government on a path that can interoperate with other global jurisdictions.</p>

 I love this: run "pipx install textual-mandelbrot" and then "mandelexp" to get an interactive Mandelbrot fractal exploration interface right there in your terminal, built on top of Textual. The code for this is only 250 lines of Python and delightfully easy to follow.

I suppose it’s about video games too, but not really; it could just as easily be about any creative act. I loved Zevin’s writing, the melancholy story, and even the characters (although they’ve been maligned elsewhere).

Here, ChatGPT exhibits something like the banality of evil: plagiarism and apathy and obviation. It summarizes the standard arguments in the literature by a kind of super-autocomplete, refuses to take a stand on anything, pleads not merely ignorance but lack of intelligence and ultimately offers a “just following orders” defense, shifting responsibility to its creators.”</p> Business <p><a href="https://19thnews.org/2023/03/women-minority-business-owners-silicon-valley-bank">The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank hit women- and minority-owned start-ups the hardest.</a> “Silicon Valley Bank was one of the few that would give venture-backed start-ups led by women, people of color and LGBTQ+ people a line of credit.

In behavioral studies, lonely people picked up on negative social signals, such as images of rejection, within 120 milliseconds — twice as quickly as people with satisfying relationships and in less than half the time it takes to blink.

<p>(4月2日16時更新) 現地（ローマ）時間3月30日、イタリアの個人データ保護監督機関であるGPDP<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/04/5220/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-5220" title="Garante per la protezione dei dati personali">1</a>(通称: Garante)は、米企業OpenAI LLCが運営するChatGPTサービスに関連するイタリア在住のユーザの個人データの処理について、仮の制限措置を命じました。GPDPは、ChatGPTによって収集されたデータ主体やユーザーに情報が提供されておらず、アルゴリズムのトレーニングのための個人データの収集や処理に適切な法的根拠がないことを指摘しました。また、13歳未満の子供のためのフィルタがなく、ユーザーの個人データ、特に未成年者の個人データの処理が、EUの一般データ保護規則（GDPR）のいくつかの条項に違反していることも指摘しました。仮の制限措置は、イタリアにおけるデータ主体の個人データ全般に適用され、措置に違反した場合は刑事罰や行政罰が科されます。データ管理者は、改善のために取られた手順と、この違反行為を正当化するために有用と思われる情報を20日以内に提供するよう要請されました。</p>



<p>以上、ChatGPTによる命令112号の要約でした<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/04/5220/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-5220" title="イタリア語の原文をDeepLで英語化し、その要約を作らせて、さらに「日本語で」とお願いしました">2</a></p>



 命令の詳細 



<p>さて、では詳細に入りたいと思います。この命令112号は、前文というか、命令を正当化する部分と、命令本体の２つの部分よりなっています。</p>



 前文 



<p>前文部分では、冒頭でGDPR(2016)とイタリアの個人情報保護法(2003)と、昨今の報道に基づく命令だとわかります。そして、次に以下のことが考慮されたと記述されます。</p>



 
 ChatGPTについての多くの報道
 
 これは3月20日に発覚したデータ漏洩（バグのせいで他の人の最初の会話が見えてしまう、日曜から月曜にサービス一時停止するまでの9時間の間にアクティブであったChatGPT Plusユーザの内1.2%のユーザの支払い関連情報<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/04/5220/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-5220" title="first and last name, email address, payment address, the last four digits (only) of a credit card number, and credit card expiration date">3</a>が見えてしまうことが多く報道されたことを指していると思われます（詳細は<a href="https://openai.com/blog/march-20-chatgpt-outage">OpenAIの3月24日発表資</a>料<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/04/5220/#easy-footnote-bottom-4-5220" title="March 20 ChatGPT outage: Here’s what happened &amp;lt;<a href=&quot;https://openai.com/blog/march-20-chatgpt-outage&quot;>https://openai.com/blog/march-20-chatgpt-outage</a>&amp;gt;">4</a> 参照）） 
 
 



 本件調査によると、ユーザもしくはOpenAIによるデータ収集およびChatGPTにおける処理対象になった者に何ら情報が提供されていないこと。 



 ChatGPTのトレーニングのためにデータを収集・処理することに適法な根拠<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/04/5220/#easy-footnote-bottom-5-5220" title="GDPR第6条。(a) 特定の目的のための同意、(b) 契約の履行または契約にさきだつ手続き、(c)法的義務、(d) 生命の保護、(e) 公共の利益、(f) 正当利益（こども及びデータ対象者の利益並びに基本的な権利及び自由のほうが優先する場合を除く） ">5</a>が無いこと。 



 データ主体の個人データの処理が、ChatGPTが提供する情報が実際のデータと必ずしも一致しないことに表されるように、データ主体の個人データの処理が不正確なものであること。 



 利用規約で13歳以上のためのサービスとしているにも関わらず、年齢確認していないこと。 



 13歳未満の子供向けのフィルターが無いため、発達段階や自己認識のに比して全く不適切な回答に子供がさらされること。 
 



<p>これらに鑑みて、処理対象となった児童を含むユーザの個人情報の処理に関して、GDPRの第5条<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/04/5220/#easy-footnote-bottom-6-5220" title="個人データの取扱いと関連する基本原則">6</a>、6条<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/04/5220/#easy-footnote-bottom-7-5220" title="取扱いの適法性">7</a>、８条<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/04/5220/#easy-footnote-bottom-8-5220" title="情報社会サービスとの関係において子どもの同意に適用される要件">8</a>、１３条<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/04/5220/#easy-footnote-bottom-9-5220" title="データ主体から個人データが取得される場合において提供される情報">9</a>、２５条<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/04/5220/#easy-footnote-bottom-10-5220" title="データ保護バイデザイン及びデータ保護バイデフォルト">10</a>に違反したと認定しています。</p>



<p>このことから、GDPR第58条(2)(f)<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/04/5220/#easy-footnote-bottom-11-5220" title="取扱いの禁止を含め、一時的な制限又は恒久的な制限を課すこと">11</a>に基づき、調査が継続中ではあるものの、緊急性に鑑みて暫定的なデータの取扱い停止命令を出すとしています。対象は、13歳未満を含む全てのイタリア在住者のデータです。利用規約で13以上としているのに13歳未満も対象としているのは、年齢制限の仕組みが実装されていないからです。これは、この処分通知が到達した時点<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/04/5220/#easy-footnote-bottom-12-5220" title="要は即日">12</a>で有効となります。また、処分の内容は調査の結果によって変わる可能性があります。</p>



<p>次に、この命令に違反した場合には、禁錮3ヶ月〜2年（イタリア個人情報保護法第170条）の罰則が与えられることが述べられています。</p>



<p>また、この命令は、緊急性に鑑みて、イタリア個人情報保護委員会設置法第5条8項<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/04/5220/#easy-footnote-bottom-13-5220" title="緊急時には委員会を開催せず、委員長の独断で決定できることを規定">13</a>に基づき、委員長の決定で出されていることが述べられます。</p>



 主文 



<p>かくなる上で、個人情報保護委員会は以下の命令を通知しています。</p>



 
 a) 規則第58条2項(f)に基づき、ChatGPTを開発・運営する米国企業OpenAI L.L.C.に対して、当該アプリケーションを通じて行われる個人情報の処理のデータ管理者として、イタリア領内に存在するデータ対象者<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/04/5220/#easy-footnote-bottom-14-5220" title="degli interessati 英語で data subject">14</a>の個人情報の処理を暫定的に制限する措置を緊急に命ず。 



 b) この命令は受け取り即時に有効であり、追加措置がありうる。 
 



<p>加えて</p>



 
 GDPR第58条に基づき、データ管理者は20日以内に本違反事件にかかわるデータの取扱を正当化する主張を委員会に届けること 
 



<p>をもとめています。なお、第58条に基づく照会に違反した場合には第83条5項eに基づき行政罰を受ける可能性があることもあわせて述べています。</p>



 感想 



<p>OpenAIにとってはなかなかしんどいですね。日本のこの手のことをやっている企業にも参考になると思います。</p>



<p>まず、ユーザもしくはOpenAIによるデータ収集およびChatGPTにおける処理対象になった者に何ら情報が提供されていない点。公開されているデータにも個人情報はたくさんはいっていますし、その処理に先立ち当該個人に処理する旨の情報提供が必要だということでしょう。かなりしんどいですね。</p>



<p>次にトレーニングに関するデータの使用に適法な根拠が無いという点。</p>



<p>GDPR第6条では</p>



 
 (a) 特定の目的のための同意、 



 (b) 契約の履行または契約にさきだつ手続き、 



 (c)法的義務、 



 (d) 生命の保護、 



 (e) 公共の利益、 



 (f) 正当利益（13歳未満およびデータの対象者の処理されない利益が上回る場合を除く） 
 



<p>を適法性根拠として上げているわけですが、まず(a)。学習データとして使うことの同意はまず取れてないですから「同意」は根拠として使えなさそうです。</p>



<p>さらに(b)。そもそも学習データとして使う段階では、契約をするかどうかわからないわけですから無理です。</p>



<p>(c)(d)が無理なのは言わずもがな。(e)の公共の利益も厳しそうです。</p>



<p>最後(f)の正当利益ですが、これに関して20日以内に回答せよとまずは言っていますね。普通に考えると、13歳未満のデータが入っていないこと、データ対象者の利益を害さないことを立証しているPIAレポートが求められそうです。</p>



<p>次が「正確性の原則」違反。デタラメ返しますからね。正確性の原則は、ついデータベースなどに保管しているデータの正確性と思いがちですが、これは処理全体にかかるので、処理の結果出てくる情報にもあてはまります。</p>



<p>5と6は子どもに対する対応の無さへの指摘。規約に書くだけでは不十分であり、年齢認証がもとめられるようです。</p>



<p>そして、処理を停止しなかったら禁錮３ヶ月〜２年。とりあえずChatGPTは日本からはまだ動いているように見えるのですが、イタリアからのアクセスはできないようにとかしたのだろうか…。いや、それだけではだめで、イタリア領内のデータ対象者のデータの処理をやめなければいけないわけですが、いったいどうやって？？？モデルからその部分を取り除けるようになっているのかしら…。</p>



<p>そして主文についてですが、これはもう端的に書いてある通り。加えて、ちゃんと20日以内に申し開きを提出することができるのかが注目されますね。</p>

<p></p><p>I’m focusing on the intersection of technology, media, and democracy. <a href="https://newsletter.werd.io/">Subscribe by email to get every update.</a></p><p>When I was the west coast Director of Investments at Matter Ventures, an early-stage accelerator for media startups with the potential to create a more informed, inclusive, and empathetic society, I co-hosted our podcast. Every week, we’d feature a new interview with a media or startup leader, recorded in front of an audience of entrepreneurs.</p><p>They’re all still online, and the conversations are every bit as relevant today. Here are some of my favorites:</p><p><a href="https://radiopublic.com/the-drunken-walk-691oXZ/s1!f29ad">Morgan DeBaun, CEO of Blavity</a>: ‌Morgan DeBaun is the CEO and co-founder of Blavity. Together with her co-founders, Morgan figured out how to build a media business that isn’t dependent on a conventional advertising model while also elevating the voices of populations too often shut out of the media — all with a constant focus on mission, on the needs of her audience, and on prototyping toward success. They’ve reinvented media in the spirit of FUBU — for us by us — for a new generation. Inclusion is about more than representation of creators: it’s about owning the means of production, too.</p><p><a href="https://radiopublic.com/the-drunken-walk-691oXZ/s1!e6766">Rebecca Kaden, managing partner, Union Square Ventures</a>: ‌Rebecca is the fourth partner ever to join Union Square Ventures and their first female partner. She spent nearly six years at Maveron prior to USV, and when she sat down with Pete Mortensen, our Director of Program in San Francisco, they shared their experiences about how having a background in liberal arts and journalism can be a superpower in venture capital, especially with early stage startups. Rebecca gets to the heart of how important it is for entrepreneurs to find the right fit when it comes to funding—and it starts with understand the human side of investors.</p><p><a href="https://radiopublic.com/the-drunken-walk-691oXZ/s1!b811a">Jennifer Brandel, CEO of Hearken</a>: ‌Jennifer Brandel, CEO of Hearken and Matter Four entrepreneur, joined us in New York City where she and Roxann Stafford, our Director of Program there, sat down to talk about her “Drunken Walk” as an entrepreneur who really sought to change the way journalists tell stories. Hearken has turned journalism on its head by actually bringing audiences into the reporting process. It provides journalists the tools they need to ask people what they want to know before going out into the field. Hearken really opens up newsrooms to find out the real questions in their communities and create more inclusive content.</p><p><a href="https://radiopublic.com/the-drunken-walk-691oXZ/s1!9f1ce">Caitlin Kalinowski, currently Head of AR Glasses Hardware at Meta</a>: ‌Caitlin Kalinowski has been a designer at the forefront of cutting-edge technology for over a decade. She got her start at Apple as one of the lead designers on the MacBook Air before she left for Facebook. Now, she is the Head of Product Design at Oculus VR. Caitlin shared her Six Steps to Product Prototyping with a group of Matter Seven entrepreneurs in San Francisco. The talk included everything from advice about how to iterate to how important it is to train people to give negative feedback. The tools she uses as a designer are really aligned with the design thinking process (yes, it’s called that for a reason) that Matter entrepreneurs learn in our 20 week accelerator program.</p><p><a href="https://radiopublic.com/the-drunken-walk-691oXZ/s1!a532c">Jane Metcalfe, CEO at NEO.LIFE</a>: ‌Jane Metcalfe is the founder of NEO.LIFE, an online publication that makes sense of the neobiological revolution. Previously, she co-founded WIRED. As well as WIRED Magazine, the group owned HotBot, the internet’s fastest search engine at the time, invented the banner ad, won numerous awards, and practically invented online publishing. Most importantly, it put a human face on the technology revolution and the people who drove it. In this talk, recorded live in front of an audience of Matter Seven entrepreneurs in San Francisco, Jane discusses building a team packed with world-class talent and giving them the space to do their best work — as well as the role of media in transforming how the world sees entire industries.</p><p><a href="https://radiopublic.com/the-drunken-walk-691oXZ/s1!0d177">Raju Narisetti, currently Leader, Global Publishing at McKinsey</a>: ‌Raju Narisetti is the CEO of Gizmodo Media Group. His journey is inspiring: from a dairy salesman to the head of a digital media group at the heart of Univision. He speaks with Roxann Stafford, Matter's Director of Program in New York, in a fireside chat recorded live with Matter Seven media entrepreneurs. Raju's experience speaks to what we acknowledge at Matter; there is no straight line to success and importance of being true to yourself. Everyone fails forward throughout their careers, and the risks Raju took and the things Raju wished he had done go to show that all of us can embrace imperfection, state our assumptions, test them, and learn.</p>

  <p>I have a side project called <a href="https://github.com/herestomwiththeweather/bookloggr">BookLoggr</a> which was created for the purpose of saving notes to books as I have done for decades but on the empty back pages of books.  A year ago I added a feature for uploading pdfs and found myself often just cutting and pasting interesting sentences.  I soon started saving academic papers as well as books.</p>

<p>Only recently have I begun to appreciate reading beginner books in french.  On each page, I’ll find many new words that I need to look up and annotate with the english word inside the book.  It is very time consuming and awkward to put the book down, pull up <a href="https://deepl.com/translate">deepl.com</a> and type the word into the translation form.  It is much less disruptive to be able to click a button to translate the page and I can optionally write the english word inside the physical copy of the book.</p>

<p>So, I decided to repurpose my existing interface for adding a note (which was already associated with a page number) to make the note the entire contents of a page.  Now, before I start reading the french book, I add each page of the book as a note.  Last night, I wrote <a href="https://github.com/herestomwiththeweather/bookloggr/commit/cb728b0f0552a84303e70d107f62eb95ecb226b0">the code</a> to allow clicking a button to translate a page of french text using DeepL.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I added the pages last night and will try it out and see how it goes…</p>

Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.</p>       <p>Consider the following policy1:</p><blockquote><p>Managers in marketing can approve transactions if they are not the owner and if the amount is less than their approval limit.</p></blockquote><p>A PDP might make the following fully qualified request to get an authorization decision:</p><blockquote><p>Can user username = Alice with jobtitle = manager and department = marketing do action = approve on resource of type = financial transaction with transaction id = 123 belonging to department = finance and with amount = 3452?</p></blockquote><p>This request contains all of the authorization context needed for the policy to run. A fully qualified request requires that the PEP gather all of the information about the request from various attribute sources.</p><p>Alternatively, consider this minimal request:</p><blockquote><p>Can user username = Alice do action = approve on resource with transaction id = 123?</p></blockquote><p>The minimal request reduces the work that the PEP must do, placing the burden on the PDP to build an authorization context with sufficient information to make a decision. We can separate this work out into a separate service called a policy information point (PIP). To build an authorization context for this request, the PIP must retrieve the following information:</p>  <p>The user’s job title, department, and approval limit.</p>  <p>The transaction’s owner and amount.</p>  <p>Building this context requires that the PIP have access to several attribute sources including the HR system (where information about Alice is stored) and the finance system&nbsp;&nbsp;(where information about transactions is stored).</p> Attribute Value Providers <p>PIPs are not usually the source of attributes, but rather a place where attributes are brought together to create the authorization context. As you saw, the PIP might query the HR and Finance systems, using attributes in the request to create fully qualified authorization context. Other examples of attribute value providers (AVP) include databases, LDAP directories, Restful APIs, geolocation services, and any other data source that can be correlated with the attributes in the minimal request. </p><p>What’s needed depends on the policies you’re evaluating. The fully qualified context should only include needed attributes, not every piece of information the PIP can gather about the request. To that end, the PIP must be configurable to create the context needed without wasteful queries to unneeded AVPs.</p> PEP Attributes <p>There is context that the PEP has that the PDP might need. For example, consider this request:</p><blockquote><p>Can user username = Alice do action = view on resource with transaction id = 123 from IP = 192.168.1.23 and browser = firefox?</p></blockquote><p>The PIP typically would not have access to the IP address or browser type. The PEP must pass that information along for use in evaluating the policy.</p> Derived Attributes <p>The PIP can enhance information that the PDP passes in to derive new attributes. For example, consider a policy that requires the request come from specific ranges of IP addresses. The first instinct a developer might have is to embed the IP range directly in the policy. However, this is a nightmare to maintain if multiple policies have the same range check—especially when the range changes. The solution is to use derived attributes, where you can define a new attribute, <code>is_ip_address_in_range</code>, and have the PIP calculate it instead. </p><p>This might be generalized with a Session Attribute component in the PIP that can enhance or transform session attributes into others that are better for policies. This is just one example of how raw attributes might be transformed to provide richer, derived attributes. Other examples include deriving an age from a birthday, an overall total for several transactions, or a unique key from other attributes.</p> Benefits of a PIP <p>While the work to gather the attributes to build the authorization context may seem like it’s the same whether the PEP or PIP does it, there are several benefits to using a PIP:</p>  <p>Simplified attribute administration—A PIP provides a place to manage integration with attribute stores that ensures the integration and interpretation are done consistently across multiple systems.</p>  <p>Reduced Complexity—PIPs can reduce the complexity of the access control system by removing the need for individual access control components to have their own policy information. PEPs are typically designed to be lightweight so they can be used close to the point where the access is enforced. For example, you might have PEPs in multiple API gateways co-located with the services they intermediate or in smartphone apps. A PIP offloads work from the PEP to keep it lightweight.</p>  <p>Separation of Concerns—PIPs separate policy information from policy decision-making, making it easier to update and modify policies and AVPs without impacting other parts of the access control system. For example, making fully qualified requests increases the coupling in the system because the PEP has to know more about policies to formulate fully qualified requests.</p>  <p>Improved Scalability— PIPs can be deployed independently of other access control components, which means that they can be scaled independently as needed to accommodate changes in policy volume or access requests.</p>  <p>Enhanced Security— PIPs can be configured to provide policy information only to authorized PDPs, which improves the security of the access control system and helps to prevent unauthorized access. In addition, a PIP builds consistent authorization contexts whereas different PEPs might make mistakes or differ in their output. </p>   Tradeoffs <p>There are tradeoffs with using a PIP. For example, suppose that the PEP is embedded in the ERP system and has local access to both the HR and financial data. It might more easily and cheaply use those attributes to create a fully qualified request. Making a minimal request and requiring the PIP to make a call back to the ERP for the data to create the authorization context would be slower.</p><p>But, as noted above, this solution increases the coupling between the PEP and PDP because the PEP now has to have more knowledge of the policies to make the fully qualified request. Developers need to use their judgement about request formulation to evaluate the tradeoffs.</p> Conclusion <p>By creating fully qualified authorization contexts from minimal requests, a PIP reduces the burden on developers building or integrating PEPs, allows for more flexible and reusable policies, and enriches authorization contexts to allow more precise access decisions.</p>    Notes   <p>The information in this article was inspired by <a href="https://axiomatics.com/blog/7-should-the-policy-enforcement-point-send-all-attributes-needed-to-evaluate-a-request">Should the Policy Enforcement Point Send All Attributes Needed to Evaluate a Request</a>? </p>  <p>Photo Credit: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/185524011@N04/49070117146">Information Desk Charleston Airport</a> from AutoRentals.com (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC BY 2.0</a>, photo is cropped from original)</p>   <p>Thanks for reading Phil Windley's Technometria!

<p>I shoot a lot of pictures. Most are from altitude (such as the above). But lots are of people and places, for example, here are a few I shot at <a href="https://dwebcamp.org/">DWebCamp</a> last summer:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Importing and curating photos is the only organized thing I do in life. Let me explain.</p>
<p>Under each of those photos is the name of the file. These are the actual file names, not ones stored in the library of some app and remembered at the meta-level. None are called&nbsp;DSCN0401.JPG,&nbsp;IMG_4523.JPG, or&nbsp;IMG_1874.PNG. I’ve given all of them meaningful names, all by the same convention: YYYY_MM_DD_name-of-event. Every file in every folder has the same name as the folder, with a number appended to it. The numbers are chronological. Each event’s folder goes into a month folder, each of those goes into a year folder, and all years go into a folder called pix-by-year. That folder has years going back to 1869. (The earliest are scans, such as <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/docsearls/179573983">this one</a>.)</p>
<p>I organize and name all my photos with a piece of software originally called iView Media Pro, then Expression Media 2 (after Microsoft bought it), and finally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_One_Media_Pro">Phase One Media Pro</a> (after Microsoft abandoned it). I like the second version best, so that’s what I use.</p>
<p>Here is a short and partial list of all the things Expression Media 2 can do:</p>
 
 Rename files in the Finder, very selectively, alone, or in batches (much more smoothly and easily than can be done with Adobe Bridge or <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts-mac/import-shortcuts-apd02bffbaac/mac">Apple’s Shortcuts or Automator</a>). 
 Search for any variable, or combination of variables 
 Sort by up to 24 variables (file name, size, date created, date modified…) 
 Resize selectively 
 Open any files with any other app 
 Run a slide show, with many choices of presentation (much more than with Apple’s Photos), and save shows as movies 
 Open any file or collection of files in any other app (for me that’s usually Photoshop 2021) 
 Basic image edits 
 Rotate, flip, zoom in and out 
 See and edit EXIF data for every shot 
 Find missing and duplicate items 
 Show or hide any file or combinations of files 
 Move files in the Finder 
 Operate in lieu of the finder when dragging or dropping into a Web page or another app 
 Arrange or tile photos by hand or by sort 
 Log and show actions 
 Place images on a map 
 Make a .pdf of any image or collection of them 
 Turn galleries into pages in .html 
 Import and export to and from .xml 
 
<p>I don’t do all that stuff, but I list it because I want to remember what I fear I will lose when I move from this 2017 MacBook Pro running Mojave to my new 16″ 2023 M2 Max MacBook Pro. That will happen later today after I upgrade both machines to the latest version of Ventura. When that happens, Expressions Media 2, a 32-bit program last updated in 2013, will be kaput. And I will need to find another workflow.</p>
<p>Maybe Expression Media 2 will survive through emulation or something. Or maybe Phase One Media Pro (also last updated in 2013) will work.</p>
<p>Or maybe one of ya’ll has a better way to manage workflow than I’m using now. I’m open.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, here goes…</p>
 
<p>Addendum: If you’re wondering why I’m not running my life on Linux and free and/or open-source software, the main reasons are Photoshop and Lightroom. I’ve tried Gimp and it doesn’t cut it. Photoshop knows the camera and lenses I’m using, and its tools, such as <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=dehaze+in+photoshop">dehaze</a>, are extremely useful. See the photos <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/docsearls/albums/72177720307077012">here</a>? Thank dehaze for making the detail pop out. (Yes, Gimp de-hazes, but <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/De-Haze-a-Photo-with-GIMP">not easily</a>.) I hate being trapped in Apple’s castle as much as the next serf, but shooting as much as I do requires tools I can use quickly and easily.</p>

<p></p>
 Availability &amp; Visibility 
<p>The basic requirement for every IoT product suite is the continuous availability and visibility of data. These updates on device health and users are key components to effective cybersecurity and monitoring. They allow you to deal with rogue or compromised devices immediately before it affects other system components. Visibility also ensures that older devices can be removed prior to becoming ghost devices (old, unused, or hidden devices), which can pose significant security risks.</p>
<p>The main problem with out-of-date software and legacy hardware associated with ghost devices is that once they pass their end-of-life cycle, the vendor no longer maintains or supports the products, resulting in security vulnerabilities and risk to organizations.</p>
 Authenticity 
<p>Other than 24/7 transmissibility, data reliability and verification of devices in both directions is also vital. In the age of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), there is rising concern surrounding authenticity of data. Sophisticated hackers are able to utilize methods to impersonate and tamper with data, potentially causing cascading failure across your enterprise.</p>
<p>To maintain airtight IoT security, you need a reliable computing base that functions as the root of trust and is tamper-proof. A root of trust holds your cryptographic keys and secures communication with the network and other channels, making it intrinsically secure. Cryptographic keys are also randomized and unique across different devices. If one device is compromised, all other devices will still remain safe.</p>
 Security 
<p>One way to verify service integrity is implementing security by design, where products and capabilities are designed from the get-go to be foundationally secure. Security is also a continual process, requiring you to patch and update systems as technology evolves.</p>
<p>Should a cyberattack occur, it is just as important to understand how your business is going to respond and recover. It is natural to focus on technology and systems but recovering should extend to your customers. That’s why creating a plan is so important. You want to make sure you can respond quickly and have the right outcomes for your business priorities.</p>
 Privacy 
<p>The EU’s expanding General Data Privacy Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the United States are just the tip of the iceberg surrounding a slew of upcoming global data privacy and cybersecurity regulations.</p>
<p>You may be subject to varying levels of privacy and IoT security regulations, if devices are deployed across different countries or regions. Non-compliance may result in hefty penalties and sanctions. It is essential to pick an ecosystem partner that can help you navigate the complex data privacy and cybersecurity landscape.</p>
 Longevity 
<p>Long term planning for an IoT project can be like looking into a crystal ball, attempting to anticipate unexpected events. Even so, be mindful of the life cycle surrounding all your technologies. For instance, there’s the danger of 2G sunsetting, rendering devices that are reliant on the technology completely obsolete.</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>The added benefit to this is your IoT solution should also be flexible and customizable throughout the entire life cycle of the device. Imagine facing a sudden influx of data during peak EV charging times, or if you had to ship your EV chargers to different countries around the world, your connectivity solutions should be able to seamlessly connect and transmit securely, regardless of where your deployment is.</p>
<p>Ignoring IoT security is no longer an option. The stakes are too high, with the potential to lose personal data and company assets at risk. By implementing best practices outlined above, you can help ensure the safety and longevity of your IoT devices and projects. Don’t wait until it’s too late to prioritize IoT security today.</p>

<p>The article looks at and explores the new Azure AD cross-tenant synchronization. The feature makes it really easy to implement the technical part of synchronization between different Azure AD tenants.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/Aad-cross-tenant-synchronization">https://github.com/damienbod/Aad-cross-tenant-synchronization</a></p>



<p></p>



 Requirements 



<p>To use this feature, both the source tenant and the target tenant require at least a P1 Azure AD license. The administrator and the application used to implement the feature needs to have the required delegated authorization. I used Microsoft Graph Explorer for this. In a second step, I will implement an ASP.NET Core application for this.</p>



 Setup 



<p>In this use case, I have two separate tenants with users, applications, groups and everything that comes with an Azure AD tenant. I would like to join these two tenants without migrating all the users, groups, and applications to one of the tenants.</p>



<p><br>A typical use case for this would when a company acquires a second company and both use Azure AD. There are many different strategies for technically merging two companies and every implementation is always different. The merge might be a m-n merge which is a more complicated to implement. It is always best to aim for simplicity. I always aim to reduce to a single source of identity for applications and use this to authenticate everything against. The single source of identity can federate to different IAM systems, but the applications should not use the external IAM directly.</p>



<p><br>I also try to have only one source of identity for users, but this is not always possible. With these complex systems, users must have only one primary identity, otherwise it gets really hard to maintain onboard, offboard and you require more tools to manage this. One problem with this solution is using on-premise applications or clients with cloud IAM solutions. For some on-premise applications, there is no network connection to the cloud systems and so exceptions needs to be implemented here if using a cloud solution as the single source of identity for applications. Azure AD and AD is one such example of this problem and Microsoft provide a good solution for this. (Azure Hybrid)<br></p>



<p>The big decision is deciding where the identities have the primary definition.</p>



<p>In this demo, we keep the identities primary definition as it was and add the members of the source tenant to the target tenant as external member users. This synchronized then.</p>







<p></p>



<p>The Microsoft <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/multi-tenant-organizations/cross-tenant-synchronization-configure-graph">documentation</a> for this is excellent and I really recommend using this when implementing the synchronization.</p>



 Setup target tenant 



<p>To implement the synchronization, the user and application need the assigned privileges for the following Microsoft Graph permissions: </p>



 
 Policy.Read.All 



 Policy.ReadWrite.CrossTenantAccess 
 



<p>You can view this in the Enterprise applications once setup. This Enterprise application is only required to create the synchronization.  This can also be deleted after the synchronization has been created. The Enterprise application is used to create a second Enterprise application used for the synchronization. You could also just implement this directly in the Azure portal. </p>



<p>The different steps to create the synchronization are described in great detail in the Microsoft Azure <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/multi-tenant-organizations/cross-tenant-synchronization-configure-graph#step-2-enable-user-synchronization-in-the-target-tenant">docs</a>.  </p>







<p></p>



 Setup source tenant 



<p>To implement the synchronization, the user and application need the assigned privileges for the following Microsoft Graph permissions: </p>



 
 Policy.Read.All 



 Policy.ReadWrite.CrossTenantAccess 



 Application.ReadWrite.All 



 Directory.ReadWrite.All 
 



<p>The different steps to create the synchronization are described in great detail in the Microsoft Azure <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/multi-tenant-organizations/cross-tenant-synchronization-configure-graph#step-4-automatically-redeem-invitations-in-the-source-tenant">docs</a>.</p>



<p></p>







<p></p>



 Synchronization configurations 



<p>The Azure AD provisioning can be setup to add all users, or scoped to a set of users, or a group of users as required. The provisioning can be setup to map the user attributes as required. I used the default settings and provision all member users.</p>



 Synchronization in operation 



<p>One the synchronization is setup, the identities are automatically updated to the target system using the defined scope and configuration. You can make changes on one tenants and the changes can be viewed on the target tenant. The trust settings can be updated to trust the original MFA form the source tenant, but care needs to be taken here. You do not want to allow weaker MFA than the required company policy. A phishing resistant MFA should be standard for any professional company that cares about its employees and security. </p>







<p></p>



<p>Now that the identities are synchronized , the next step would be to move the applications and the groups for the shared services.</p>

recently. Sorry if this is a bit cryptic, it was written for a very specific technical
audience. I have added a few annotations in square brackets to provide context.</p>
<p>What am I missing in my wish list?</p>
 
<p>Putting on my product developer hat, here’s what I want for Christmas:</p>
 A single-document basic [Fediverse] interop spec, ie. 
 
 when I have written code for everything it says, my code will interoperate in some basic fashion with all other software that has implemented this document 
 no need to consult or understand other implementations 
 may be quite basic, e.g. text content only, only a minimal set of activity types 
 enables implementors to have a “MVP”-style interop at lowest-possible engineering effort (including the time required to read/understand the specs!) 
 This could be done as a “minimal profile” of a stack that contains a subset of AP [ActivityPub], AS [ActivityStreams], and Webfinger 
 
 A test suite for that profile 
 
 suitable to add to my automated test suite 
 over time, this test suite can grow beyond the minimal profile 
 
 A branding program for products that have passed the test suite 
 
 As an implementor, you get to put the sticker on your product. 
 In particular, in the places in the product where users “connect” to other servers in the Fediverse, like “Visa” is displayed at the POS terminal 
 I believe this will become critical if/when larger orgs with potentially different value systems connect to the Fediverse 
 
 A set of web “intent buttons” for Like, Follow, Post, etc that work across sites 
 
 like they exist for centralized social media 
 as easy to use for the user 
 we can argue how this can be accomplished technically. I have opinions, but for this wish list, they are immaterial, as long as I get those buttons :-) 
 
 A standardized way to express terms under which content is provided 
 
 As I understand it, Bob Wyman calls that a Rights Expression Language 
 This probably should start with a use case collection 
 
 A design for search that meets the requirements of all relevant parties and points of view 
 
 This is probably far less a technical problem than one of successful communication 
 
 A design to reduce certain loads 
 
 Fan-out 
 Video 
 (Not my area of expertise, so I don’t have details) 
 
 Improved identity management across the Fediverse 
 
 Easy-to-use single-sign-on across servers. Use case: I use several apps for different content types (like micro blog and video). Bonus: they all post from the same identifier 
 Easy-to-use persona management. Use case: I have a personal and a work account, bonus if they can be on the same server 
 Identifiers not tied to the domain name system 
 
<p>Some of this squarely falls in the domain of this group [that would be the W3C’s Social Web Interest Community Group], some is adjacent. It could be pulled in, or it can be done somewhere else. I don’t particularly care about that either, as long as it gets done and done consistently with the rest.</p>
<p>Now I’m sure you all are going to tell me why I can’t have all those things for Christmas, and certainly not this Christmas. But I can wish, no? (More seriously, I think they are all essential for continued successful growth of the ActivityPub network as new parties connect)</p>

Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.</p>       <p>I was at <a href="https://devopsdays.org/events/2023-salt-lake-city/welcome/">SLC DevOpsDays</a> last week and attended a talk by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharon-goldberg-002803143/">Sharon Goldberg</a> on MFA in 2023. She's a security expert and focused many of her remarks on the relative security of different multi-factor authentication (MFA) techniques, a topic I cover in my book as well. I liked how she described the security provisions of passkeys (also know as Fast ID Online or FIDO).</p><p>FIDO is a challenge-response protocol that uses public-key cryptography. Rather than using certificates, it manages keys automatically and beneath the covers, so it’s as user-friendly as possible. I’m going to discuss the latest FIDO specification, FIDO2, here, but the older FIDO U2F and UAF protocols are still in use as well.</p><p>FIDO uses an authenticator to create, store, and use authentication keys. Authenticators come in several types. Platform authenticators are devices that a person already owns, like a laptop or smartphone. Roaming authenticators take the form of a security key that connects to the laptop or smartphone using USB, NFC, or Bluetooth.</p><p>This is a good time for you to stop reading this and head over to <a href="https://www.passkeys.io/">Passkeys.io</a> and try them for yourself. If you're using a relatively modern OS on your smartphone, tablet, or computer, you shouldn't have to download anything. Sign up using your email (it doesn't have to be a real email address), do whatever your device asks when you click "Save a Passkey" (on my iPhone it does Face ID, on my MacOS laptop, it does Touch ID). Then sign out.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49a6a097-8e65-4eb3-8300-e0526c8ba8e4_2350x1624.png">    </a>Using Touch ID with Passkey <p>Now, click on "Sign in with a passkey". Your computer will let you pick an identifier (email address) that you've used on that site and then present you with a way to locally authenticate (i.e., on the device). It's that simple. In fact, my biggest fear with passkeys is that it's so slick people won't think anything has happened.</p><p>Here's what's going on behind the scenes: When Alice registers with an online service like Passkeys.io, her authenticator (software on her phone, for example) creates a new cryptographic key pair, securely storing the private key locally and registering the public key with the service. The online service may accept different authenticators, allowing Alice to select which one to use. Alice unlocks the authenticator using a PIN, fingerprint reader, or face ID.</p><p>When Alice authenticates, she uses a client such as a browser or app to access a service like a website (see figure below). The service presents a login challenge, including the chance to select an account identifier, which the client (e.g., browser) passes to the authenticator. The authenticator prompts Alice to unlock it and uses the account identifier in the challenge to select the correct private key and sign the challenge. Alice’s client sends the signed challenge to the service, which uses the public key it stored during registration to verify the signature and authenticate Alice.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc5422e81-9975-49fe-b853-e16c676d1684_427x257.png">    </a>Authenticating with Passkey <p>FIDO2 uses two standards. The <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-v2.0-id-20180227/fido-client-to-authenticator-protocol-v2.0-id-20180227.html">Client to Authenticator Protocol (CTAP)</a> describes how a browser or operating system establishes a connection to a FIDO authenticator. The <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2-2/fido2-web-authentication-webauthn/">WebAuthN protocol</a> is built into browsers and provides an API that JavaScript from a Web service can use to register a FIDO key, send a challenge to the authenticator, and receive a response to the challenge.</p><p>One of the things I liked about Dr. Goldberg's talk is that she emphasized that the security of passkeys rests on three things:</p>  <p>Transport Layer Security (TLS) to securely transport challenges and responses.</p>  <p>The WebAuthN protocol that gives websites a way to invoke the local authentication machinery using a Javascript API.</p>  <p>A secure, local connection between the client and authenticator using CTAP.</p>  <p>One of the weaknesses of how we use TLS today is that people don't usually check the lock icon in the browser and don't understand domain names enough to tell if they're being phished. Passkeys do this for you. The browser unambiguously transfers the domain name to the authenticator which knows if it has an established relationship with that domain or not. Authenticating that you're on the right site is a key reason they're so much more secure than other MFA alternatives. Another is having a secure channel from authenticator to service, making phishing nearly impossible because there's no way to break into the authentication flow.</p><p>Passkeys provide a secure and convenient way to authenticate users without resorting to passwords, SMS codes, or TOTP authenticator applications. Modern computers and smartphones and most mainstream browsers understand FIDO protocols natively. While roaming authenticators (hardware keys) are available, for most use cases, platform authenticators (like the ones built into your smartphone or laptop) are sufficient. This makes FIDO an easy, inexpensive way for people to authenticate. As I said, the biggest impediment to its widespread use may be that people won’t believe something so easy is secure.</p><p></p>   <p>Thanks for reading Phil Windley's Technometria!

We find the same duality phenomena is reflected in the business world as we try to find a balance between creating new and maintaining what we have.&nbsp;</p><p>Nature does not favour new over old but ebbs and flows, appearing to have a fluid, ever-changing dynamic stability; however, businesses try to prioritise based on a purpose, and this piece highlights that often there is an unwillingness to consider both perspectives in balance, which is detrimental.&nbsp; What are the right questions to ask to determine if your purpose or strategy will disrupt fragile balances or if you are aligned and can thrive?&nbsp;</p><p>This is a 20-minute read which will challenge your perceptions and presuppositions of the role you inhabit and the role your ecosystem plays on you.</p><br><br><br><br><br> Can you, I, us, society or business have a single purpose? <br><p>In our natural world, two dependent systems keep our fragile life from ending. One is the ability to mutate and adapt, and the other is maintenance (homeostasis) and memory. When we observe the dynamic expansions and contractions in our natural world, we see the two-sides of this dynamic system competing.&nbsp; We can label these forces as “error creation” and “error correction”, and there is a never-ending ebb and flow between the two states, which creates a dynamic stability or an unbalanced equilibrium; two oxymorons which we will explore below. The ability to see both sides of a perspective gives us a wider vantage point that can help us unlock powerful insights into why a single unified purpose is not feasible, why AI will not take over, and how to avoid failure in times of uncertainty.</p> Is believing in a unified purpose a protective delusion?&nbsp; <p>The theory of evolution is a scientific explanation for how life on Earth has changed over time and how different species have arisen from common ancestors. It is based on the idea that all living things share a common ancestry and that the diversity of life we see today results from gradual changes over millions of years through a process called natural selection. Natural selection is the process by which certain traits become more or less common in a population based on their effects on survival and reproduction. Random mutation being the way to create new traits and adaptation, are central to the theory of evolution.</p><p>Homeostasis is maintenance, it refers to the ability of an organism to maintain a stable internal environment despite changes in the external environment. It is essential for the survival and well-being of an organism, and disruptions to this balance can have serious consequences. Memory refers to the process of storing, retaining, and retrieving information both individually and at a societal level; consider here how history, culture, law and even paintings and architecture are memory. Memory gives an organism the ability to maintain a sense of stability despite being in a changing environment, as one is able to recall the expected outcome of a familiar circumstance.&nbsp; Homeostasis and memory are critical for stability and survival.&nbsp;</p><p>These concepts, mutation &amp; adaptation and homeostasis &amp; memory, have been observed for thousands of years, and as humans unpack the complex connectivity between them, we can better articulate what we observe, which is why it can be so difficult to find and follow a singular goal to its completion. The connection between them has elements of both immediacy and delay: mutation demands an immediate response from homeostasis, yet also drives changes over time through immunity responses"; In the long run, human changes create environments for different mutations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>To the observer who notices that there are no arrows, there is a reason for that. It is about the connection, relationship, and coupling, not the directionality of flow.&nbsp;</p><p>Life is often framed as a competitive arms race: the survival of the fittest between living organisms that adapt to a constantly variable, but ultimately stable system. Mutations are randomness in the complex life coding system that creates new traits.&nbsp; Mutations can create an advantage in the arms race as they can lead to unique traits which make an organism fitter for its environment.&nbsp; Advantageous traits tend to thrive, whereas non-advantageous traits will either cease to exist or live on at a subsistence level.</p><p>Cyber security is positioned as a similar modern-day example of an arms race, but in reality, it is one system (virus) that is looking for a vulnerability to give it an advantage, and the other system running anti-virus is responding/ adapting to prevent it. The virus can only be created because the system has a fundamental flaw (weakness), and it is a race between those who want to uncover it and those who want to hide it, but the flaw exists. It is not the same.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>One could use the free market economy as a modern example of this phenomenon of mutation and homeostasis, whereby we use the words “innovation” and “competition” as synonyms for “mutation” and “survival of the fittest”. To describe innovation as solely beneficial, or solely detrimental would be incorrect; likewise, it is not reasonable to suggest that stability is solely one or the other. In all aspects of life, there is a balance between chaos and order, mutation and homeostasis, and innovation and tradition. Therefore, when we re-frame our thinking, we see that believing in a single, unified purpose is a delusion, as this singular goal only represents one side of a dynamic system whereby control on one end does not create the end game, and we only have a bright future because we have two.</p> A preference for labelling <p>If I gave you a choice between “innovation” and “mutation”, which one do you associate with value, creativity and growth?</p><p>Transposing the words that describe our natural world directly into a business environment would create fear, uncertainty and doubt.&nbsp; “We are working hard on innovation” sounds more impressive and reasonable than “we are creating new mutations.”&nbsp; “We mostly operate in a competitive market” sounds so much more plausible than “it is an arms race for the survival of the fittest”.&nbsp; Words matter, and because they do, we can use words to create dynamics to be more or less willing to discuss and debate hard topics in the boardroom.&nbsp;</p><p>The next section utilises the word “error”;&nbsp; in this context, an "error" is the gap between expected and observed. I understand that many readers will want to stick with their natural framing of an error as right/ wrong, but “error” can mean:</p>  <p>a moral offence;&nbsp;</p>  <p>belief in something untrue;&nbsp;</p>  <p>the state or condition of being wrong in conduct or judgement;</p>  <p>a mistake, blunder, lapse, or slip;</p>  <p>a deviation from perception, expected, accuracy or correctness;&nbsp;</p>  <p>the difference between the observed and actual</p>  <p>Error in this work is closer to the framing of the lower three bullets than the top three.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> How does a system based on “error creation” and “error correction” sound?&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>The dynamic of our natural world system is that one system is creating something new and different whilst the other is trying to correct and mitigate the change. One is bringing in the new, and the other defending the existing.&nbsp; One is the hope of something better, whilst the other is happy not to take the risk and maintain the same. Both sides create risk; strangely, different risks are created by each side, but nevertheless, risk.&nbsp; Error creation, in this instance, is invention, innovation and creativity.&nbsp; Error correction is stability and familiar processes that we know (and trust) from historical experience.&nbsp; The risk in the former is change, and the risk in the latter is to become not relevant.&nbsp; They are different risks.</p><p>The risk in the former is change, and the risk in the latter is to become not relevant.&nbsp; They are different risks.</p><p></p><p>How often do we translate the message we receive from leadership that we need to be both “more innovative” whilst simultaneously “improving efficiency and effectiveness” as a demand to compromise on everything and lack focus? Perhaps we should see this balance as the maintenance of an equilibrium of "error creation" and "error correction" because it creates something new that we label as value.&nbsp;</p><p>Leadership that fails to recognise there is a need for balance will fail; we first need to determine where we are in the system and which system we favour; from there, it should be easier to determine what journey we are on and where the north star is.&nbsp;</p><p>This is not “trial and error”, as before a trial, there has to be a hypothesis, and the error is a deviation in the results from the expected/ predicted.&nbsp; It is neither “error and trial”, where an error is created without a hypothesis and using some measure, one tries to determine if the error was successful. Then there is AB testing. However, these are all controlled point methods and are not about dynamic reactive complex systems.&nbsp;</p> The answer to the universe, world and everything (#douglasadams) <p>To fans of The HitchHickers Guide to the Universe, we know the answer is 42, but the question remains;&nbsp; we just needed another 5 minutes!&nbsp; My struggle with the answer, as given, was whether it was relevant when the question was asked or given since 7.5 million years passed, and a lot happens in big time frames. I would have loved to have asked Douglas.</p><p>So often, there is a dynamic between two competing ideas, both trying to be the more important single unifying idea or purpose.&nbsp; Humans want to be both heard and belong.&nbsp; It is not that one is better than the other, but one is more error creation (listen to my new idea) and one more error correction (stability of belonging).&nbsp; Some business leaders will say their purpose is “shareholder primacy”, whilst others say their core purpose is to “improve the lives of their customer”. This is a nonexclusive club - and there are many others - however, most companies settle on a purpose that is a compromise. It is safe to say that business purpose varies depending on the specific goals and values of the company and its stakeholders.&nbsp; It could be argued that the purpose of a business is to balance creating more value for the majority of the customers, shareholders, employees, and wider society as a whole than the destruction or erosion of value for others.&nbsp; Purpose itself is achieved through various competing ideas, such as developing innovative products or services, providing high-quality customer service, maintaining ethical business practices, and contributing to the ecosystem the organisation operates in.&nbsp;</p><p>When we reflect on this concept, we see that a business is itself demanding that it “creates errors” and “correct errors.” Remember, this is not “mistakes” or moral pearls; this is seeing innovation as creating change, which is an error to the system of no change. Businesses need to create new ideas and innovations but also correct errors that try to change the stability of process efficiency.&nbsp; Leadership needs to craft a level of instability whilst maintaining equilibrium.&nbsp; Note: another framing of “error” could be morally unethical behaviour and trading without reason whilst insolvent. These activities are not errors; they are illegal, and it is not what we are focused on.</p><p>Leadership needs to craft a level of instability whilst maintaining equilibrium.</p><p>Perhaps we should accept that there cannot be one single unifying purpose, and we exist in a place where some individuals, leaders, and teams favour change (error creation) and some stability (error correction), but without both, we would lose our ever-changing dynamic stability.</p> The Purpose and origin of Innovation (as an example of error creation) <p>Innovation refers to the process of creating something new or improving upon an existing product, service, or process. The purpose of innovation is to bring about positive change and to solve problems more effectively or efficiently. Innovations can be incremental or disruptive, with the latter representing a significant shift in how things are done.</p><p>The origin of innovation can be traced back to human curiosity and the desire to improve the quality of life. Throughout history, humans have constantly sought ways to improve their lives, whether it be through inventions such as the wheel or electricity, or the development of new technologies like mobile phones and the web. Innovation has played a vital role in driving progress and advancing society.</p><p>Innovation has become increasingly important as businesses seek to stay competitive and meet the changing needs of consumers. Companies invest in research and development to create new products and services to improve efficiency, increase profits, and create new market opportunities. Governments also encourage innovation through funding research and development, providing incentives for businesses, and fostering collaboration between industry and academia.</p><p>Overall, the purpose and origin of innovation are rooted in human ingenuity and the desire to create something new and better. Innovation has been and will continue to be a critical driver of progress and growth in all aspects of society, including how we achieve sustainability.&nbsp;</p><p>We like innovation as long it is not called error creation or mutation, but the reality is, no matter how hard we try, they are one and the same. &nbsp; If you naturally align with an error correction ontology, you may have a creative mindset and enjoy the process of disruption, change, and the outcomes of instability.</p><p>There are exceptions: fraud, bribery and corruption.</p> The Purpose and origin of Accounting (as an example of error correction) <p>The origins of accounting can be traced back thousands of years to ancient civilisations such as the Babylonians, who kept records of their transactions on clay tablets. In medieval Europe, accounting was used primarily by merchants and bankers to keep track of their financial transactions. The original purpose of business accounting was to provide shareholders with accurate and timely information about the financial performance and position of an organisation.</p><p>Accounting is a system of recording, analysing and summarising financial transactions to prevent errors, provide accuracy, and present information that is useful in making business decisions. Over time, accounting has evolved into a sophisticated discipline with its own set of principles and standards. In addition to serving the needs of businesses, accounting also serves the broader needs of society. For example, accounting information is used by governments to track tax revenues and by investors to make investment decisions. Accounting also plays an important role in maintaining the integrity of financial markets by providing reliable information about the financial performance of companies.</p><p>We may naturally align to the framing of finance as long it is not called error correction, doing the same, preventing change and improving stability, but the reality is, no matter how hard we try, they are one and the same. If you naturally align with an error correction ontology, you may have a more accounting mindset, whereby you will naturally look for order amidst chaos and create stable processes out of a loose set of desires.</p><p>There are exceptions: fraud, bribery and corruption.</p> How do other business functions align? <p>Marketing, sales, and product development appear to tend towards error creation, with operations, legal, and accounting systems tending towards error correction.&nbsp; It is possible that where technology and HR sits is critical to the overall balancing culture of the company and if the company favours error creation (creative, imaginative, innovative) or error correction (stable, historical, and dutiful.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The descriptions above used “tend towards.” The basic function of accounting is to remove errors, but it also has to improve continually because of the necessity of continually correcting new errors. &nbsp; The basic function of marketing is creativity, never repeating campaigns and coming up with new and different ideas. But if marketing were only creative, it would not be able to align and build upon what is already there and how the market behaves.&nbsp; Creative flair for error creation is tempered by the history and context of error correction.&nbsp; All functions demand both, and we need to understand how the balance is created by the purpose, function, and culture of the team.&nbsp;</p><p>Teams define culture.&nbsp; Teams are made of individuals who are either going to be more aligned to error-creating or error-correcting. Whilst we prefer to label individuals as&nbsp; “creative” or “checklist,” these do describe the characteristics, leadership attitudes, and biases that are critical to determining what function a department actually fulfils.&nbsp; These balances are not simple; indeed, they are complex.</p><p>Creative flair for error creation is tempered by the history and context of error correction.</p><p></p><p>A board needs to comprehend, appreciate, and understand if the balance is right. If a board is not diverse in thought, skill, and discipline, that balance may not be found or is easily lost, and the culture of one or the other can lead a business to failure, especially with an overly dominant financial focus as accounting tends to focus on being financially risk-averse. &nbsp;It is worth noting that balance, in this sense, is not about equality; the balance creates enough errors to improve continually (agile) but with enough error correction to be resilient.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The balance must create enough errors to improve continually (agile) but with enough error correction to be resilient.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Wider perspective <p></p><br><p>The error creation/correction model can scale to other forms of thinking:&nbsp;</p>  <p>Fear can be seen as error creation, whereas trust is error correction.&nbsp; There is undoubtedly a complex relationship between fear and trust that is both immediate and develops over time.&nbsp; Trust can correct fear that is related to an error originating from the past, but trust can also create a new path.&nbsp;</p>  <p>The concept of 'self' is error-creation, whereby we tend to express our individuality within a system of societal norms and memory which seeks stability and error correction.&nbsp; Individuals create eros, and their movement (many followers) creates a change which eventually becomes the new normal.</p>  <p>Freedom allows for error creation, whilst control demands correction from deviation.&nbsp; Too much freedom or too much control both appear terminal based on history. Prison and punishment systems struggle with this balance on so many levels, even using “error correction” as an idea in a different context.</p>  <p>Both error creation and error correction harbour risk, and both can be seen as creating more risk.&nbsp; Benefit&nbsp; demands an understanding of the value and cost of moving away from the known and can be seen as both more error creation (advantage) and correction (prevention).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>These examples are non-linear, and balance does not necessarily mean 50:50 and perhaps a less controversial language might be to substitute “error” with “difference.” The difference is the way in which two things, when compared, are not the same.&nbsp;</p><p>What else have you observed that represents two sides of a dynamic complex relationship, where one or both favour error creation and one error correction?&nbsp;</p><p>It is worth pondering about how and why we try to reduce the complexity of the balance into a single ROI figure in order to pass a hurdle and justify a decision.&nbsp; Can ROI ever capture consequences?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> What happens when we get it wrong? <p>Wrong, in this case, is where the balance is lost, and too many errors or too much correction ends in survival becoming unviable, with death being the only inevitable outcome. Business failure.&nbsp;</p><p>In the wild, a mutation that does not provide an advantage can easily be lost, and an overly controlled stable environment can dwindle to nothing if it fails to adapt to modernity.&nbsp;</p><p>In the economics of a business, the same is true: an innovation will not give an advantage forever, and the next innovation may not provide a new advantage. Equally, too much control and stability as a result of finance controls and regulation will result in the company becoming outdated in comparison to its environment or ecosystem - the result is the company or sector will enter a slow decline. #banking</p><p>A company does not exist on its own but in a complex ecosystem, and the balance may be achieved within the ecosystem and not just in the health or balance of a single company. In nature, the predator-prey model often forgets that the rabbit/fox needs other food and water, as well as the rabbit/fox having other threats.&nbsp; A company may well be out of balance in itself, but balance is remediated by others in the ecosystem, which is why strategy is not just about innovation, but the balance that is maintained by the ecosystem in order to create dynamic stability. It is important to understand who is moving towards stability and who is moving towards innovation; otherwise, the whole ecosystem itself can fall out of balance.</p><p>This highlights that any theory of error creation/correction must embrace relevance on at least four levels: individual, team, organisation, and ecosystem.&nbsp; A purpose may articulate what you want, but a purpose that is not dynamic in its ability to move and balance error creation and error correction at all levels is going to be short-lived.&nbsp;</p> Reframing AI away from “Intelligent Machinery.” <p>Defining the term 'artificial intelligence' presents us with a problem. The problem is that human intelligence fundamentally depends on a balanced system where error creation and error correction co-exist.&nbsp; Many of the most historic creative minds, insightful thinkers and leading scientists were neurodiverse (error-creating) and spent their lives fighting systems of error correction (academic, power, religious.)&nbsp; Flat earthers, climate deniers and Copernicus with the heliocentric model of the solar system are a few that history has thrown up.&nbsp;</p><p>Using the lens of error creation and correction, we can say that we are building ever more advanced error correction systems from big data tools, identification and removal of bias, better accounting, DNA manipulation, eradicating viruses, and using tech to provide compliance, governance, and oversight.&nbsp; In this perspective, it becomes more obvious that we do not currently focus on using ever more advanced tech to actually create errors as a route for advantage. If AI were like nature, an AI that only corrects or one that only creates errors could not survive.&nbsp;</p><p>If AI only needs to find and fix errors through the error correction lens, then AI will only be half a system and will be artificial but not intelligent. Data can be error-correcting and error-generating, but if we don't know this part of the ontology, we will never be able to gain more intelligence.&nbsp;</p><p>The diagram below expands on this thinking to suggest that there is more than just one system on the error-correcting side.&nbsp; Error correction is more complex as it needs to amend errors which are not advantageous, and promote the development of errors which are. It is equally true that the error creation side has to have a system that moderates errors, or it would be too wild, and create destruction before the opportunity arose to test if a new trait provided an advantage. The closed-loop system is full of complex feedback loops to both control and promote; with both immediacy and delay.&nbsp; What is evident is that the system is neither stable nor unstable but has pulsing oscillation, which keeps it in a delicate balance.&nbsp;</p>   The axis of thriving and death <p>What came first, the chicken or the egg?&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>In a world where error correction (driven by the desire to use experience and the past as the solid foundation) is the initiation or y-axis, and the response is error creation (creativity, invention and innovation) or x-axis, we get thinking dominated by being controlled first, and being unstable second, which creates the volatility and ambiguity that allows for dynamic stability, it is a place where we can thrive and grow. This could be our economic and political world viewed through the lens of law, policy, study, social norms, culture, and data.</p><p>In a world where error creation (driven by a desire for change, innovation, creativity, adventuring, pioneering, and invention) is the initiation, and the response is error correction (finance, risk management and control), we get instability dominating our thinking, and the environment is unbalanced, yet still in equilibrium.&nbsp; Complexity and uncertainty become leading ideas. In a place of unbalanced equilibrium, we are still able to thrive and grow. This could be our economic and political world viewed through the lens of research, hypothesis, invention, ideation, hope, and imagination.</p><p>It would appear that:&nbsp; dynamic stability + unbalanced equilibrium creates a balanced system that thrives.</p><p>What we should avoid are too much control and too much error - the question is, what do any of these worlds look or feel like, and how will we recognise them?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The last thing a fish will become aware of is water teaches us that our current environment can feel normal when in reality, it may be out of balance.&nbsp; If we cannot see or know the balance, we have lost our propensity to manage change.&nbsp;</p> Why does all this matter <p>Leadership through one lens (unbalanced equilibrium) depends on being curious, whereas leadership from the other lens (dynamic stability) demands a focus on efficiency and effectiveness, but both perspectives need to continually improve how they inform and direct decision making.&nbsp;</p><p>We often see fantastic single-idea books that encourage leadership to optimise decision-making towards growth driven by error creation (how to disrupt yourself, agile, reinvention, cross the chasm, the new normal, change management, repurpose, innovation, re-engineering); it is likely, with such a narrow focus, to lead to poor decision-making, as the benefits and outcomes for error correction are ignored or suppressed.&nbsp; This is equally true in reverse, and there are equally brilliant books that optimise for error correction (efficiency, time management, effectiveness, infinite, leadership, tick lists, ethics, merit, principles, governance, accounting, and statistics).&nbsp;</p><p>If we try to get the balance for a better outcome from both error creation and correction, we will likely get sub-optimal results for both.&nbsp; Even with all the resources in the world, nature still ebbs and flows, as it cannot optimise for both and has learnt to make compromises, but we thrive because of it.&nbsp;</p><p>The title of this long read is “Why finding purpose feels impossible”; on reflection, the title could equally have been “Why a singular unified business purpose is impossible for everyone”. If we accept we have to balance error creation and correction, a single purpose has to favour or optimise for one or the other, which means that many employees and stakeholders feel the stated “purpose” does not align with or represent them. Balance is rarely 50:50, it can come in many forms: 0:100, 80:20, 99:1, etc. Balance exists, but the context is dependent on the purpose you are trying to achieve. This is where exceptional leadership comes into its own.</p> The takeaway for leadership <p>A critically important task/ role for leadership, the board, executives, and governance are to determine:</p>  <p>If our organisation favours error-creation or error-correction</p>  <p>Where is the balance for our organisation?</p>  <p>Are we in balance? If not, are we planning to or sourcing the skills necessary to improve balance?</p>  <p>How is balance in our ecosystem achieved, what are others doing?</p>  <p>Is our organisation/ecosystem in or out of balance, and does our action change anything?</p>  <p>The most important purpose for leadership, the board, executives and governance are to understand and determine if our organisation and ecosystem are in or out of balance.&nbsp;</p><p>The problem with strategy and purpose is that we can have agreed and have an agreement, but that does not mean we agree.&nbsp; Working out balance is complex, whereas how we are performing against the plan is rather more straightforward.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>To determine and find balance, we must shift our focus from individual, singular and expert towards collective, group and ecosystem.&nbsp; Whilst the former is positioned as strong leadership, and the latter is portrayed as introducing delay, compromise, tension and conflict - it is evident that to thrive, we must know how to find and deliver balance.&nbsp;</p><br><br>

 Networks are everywhere, and they are valuable. Consider: 
 
 The road network. Imagine you’d need a different car for each piece of road. Life as
we know it today would be utterly impossible without it. 
 The phone network. To pick two random use cases, without it you couldn’t call customer
service or summon an ambulance. 
 The Visa credit card network (and its competitors). You would have to us

<p>Networks are everywhere, and they are valuable. Consider:</p>
 
 The road network. Imagine you’d need a different car for each piece of road. Life as
we know it today would be utterly impossible without it. 
 The phone network. To pick two random use cases, without it you couldn’t call customer
service or summon an ambulance. 
 The Visa credit card network (and its competitors). You would have to use cash instead,
but arguably everybody accepting the same currency forms a network, too, and
without that, we’d be back to barter. Which would be really inconvenient. 
 The world-wide-web.  Some of us are old enough to remember the times before. No on-demand news,
music, entertainment, chatting, reservations, e-commerce and all the others. 
 
<p>Generally, larger networks are more valuable than smaller networks: if you are the
only person in the world who has a telephone, that phone is not worth much. If there
are 2 people with phones, you can at least call each other. With 3 people, 3 different
conversations can be had. With 4, it’s 6. With 100, it’s 100*99/2 = 4950 possible
conversations, not counting multi-party conference calls. This quadratic growth of value
with the size of the network applies to all networks, according to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law">Metacalfe’s Law</a>.</p>
<p>But in this post, I want to look at another dimension of networks that impacts their
values, and that is whether the network is “open” or “closed”. There are lots of details
one could consider, but for our purposes here, we define a spectrum with two
extremes, and lots of gray in the middle:</p>

 
  Fully open
  Somewhere in between
  Entirely closed
 
 
  Anybody can connect to the network and do what they like,
      nobody's permission is required.
  
  Who may connect, and what they may do on the network,
      is closely controlled by the network proprietor.
 

<p>There can be all sorts of network proprietors, but for simplicity in this post, assume
it’s a single entity, like Meta.</p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>

 
  Fully open
  Somewhere in between
  Entirely closed
 
 
  The public road system.
  
  Roads on a private golf course.
 
 
  Buyers and sellers using cash.
  Buyers and sellers using Visa.
  Internal company accounting system.
 
 
  The world-wide web.
  
  Facebook. Twitter. The old AOL walled garden.
 

<p>If you had two networks that are otherwise identical in size, structure and function,
except that one is open and the other one is closed, which of those two is more valuable?</p>
<p>Valuable to whom?</p>

 
  Fully open
  Somewhere in between
  Entirely closed
 
 
  
   Valuable to:
    
     Platform proprietor: no, does not exist 
     Network users: yes 
    
  
  
  
  
   Valuable to:
    
     Platform proprietor: yes 
     Network users: yes 
    
  
 

<p>It’s clear that if both networks produce the same amount of total value, the open
network is more valuable to its users (such as individuals and organizations),
for the simple reason that there is no network proprietor who needs to get paid! The
value entirely accrues to the network participants.</p>
<p>But there’s more to it: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Doctorow">Cory Doctorow</a> recently coined the
term <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/enshittification">enshittification</a> to describe
the inevitable march of platform/network proprietors, over time, to siphon off an ever-larger percentage
of value generated by their network, to the detriment of its users. So the older a
closed network, the less value it provides to its users. (Facebook users experience this
every day: ever more ads, ever less genuine human engagement. While, for its business users,
ad prices go up.) In an open network, on the other hand, the value that accrues to the users
does not deteriorate over time.</p>
<p>And finally: could AOL, the online service, ever have provided the same value as
the open web? Of course absolutely not! Open networks allow many more technologists
and entrepreneurs to innovate in a gazillion different ways that would never be
possible in a closed network. As closed networks mature, not only do they
enshittify, but they also further and further discourage innovation by third parties,
while the opposite is true for open networks.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the Fediverse. Which is more valuable today: the decentralized,
open social network called the Fediverse (with its thousands of independently operated
Mastodon, and other instances), or the poster closed social network, Facebook?</p>
<p>Clearly, Facebook. That’s because by all counts, Facebook today has order-of-magnitude
about 1000 times the number of users of the Fediverse. Same for Twitter, which has maybe
100 times the number of users of the Fediverse.</p>
<p>But the network effect is the only thing the closed social platforms have going for
themselves. All other parts of the value proposition favors the open social network
alternative. Think of this:</p>
 
 The Fediverse extracts far less / no value: no annoying ads, no user manipulation
favoring the business model of the network proprietor. 
 More functionality: it’s one interoperable social network with apps that emulate
Twitter, Facebook, Medium, Reddit, Goodreads, and many others! In the same network. 
 It’s entirely open for innovation, and innovators are building furiously as we speak.
By its nature, it’s permanently locked open for innovation, and there is no danger of
ever getting cut off from an API, facing sudden connection charges or drawing the wrath
of a gazillionaire. 
 
<p>So by the time the Fediverse has sufficient numbers of users, it’s game over for
proprietary social networks. This is true for both user categories in social networks:
individuals and businesses. (I assume here that businesses and the Fediverse will find
a way of accommodating each other, mainly by businesses behaving respectfully. If not, there
simply will be no businesses in the Fediverse.) Individuals will get more value from the
open network, and businesses will be far more profitable because there is no network operator
to pay and many products and services pop up all the time that won’t in the closed network.</p>
<p>Note that the critical “sufficient number of users” can likely be substantially smaller
than the user populations of those closed networks today, because all value accrues to
users and it’s not diminished by value extraction from a network proprietor. For many
of my own use cases, in many niches the Fediverse has critical mass today already.</p>
<p>Can the user advantage be overcome across the board? We will have to see. But if we add up just
numbers of active users of organizations that have publicly announced Fediverse plans as of the date that
I’m writing this, or even have products already in the market – Flipboard, Medium, Mozilla, Tumblr,
Wordpress and more – we’re already in the high 100’s of millions.</p>
<p>Those numbers look awfully close to the user numbers necessary to overcome Metcalfe’s Law.</p>
<p>tldr; The time to take the Fediverse seriously, for individuals and businesses, is now.
The value of the Fediverse for everybody is much higher than the value of any closed,
proprietary social network – other than the proprietary social network companies
themselves. And we won’t cry for them very much.</p>
<p>Note: <a href="https://fediforum.org">FediForum</a> is next week, where we’ll discuss this.</p>

<p>I recently engaged in a compelling discussion with Kevin Clark and Mike McGuire from CE neWorld about the crucial topic of organizational and personal identity. We explore the significance of personal data and the choices we must make as business leaders. As we dive deeper into this important conversation, I was curious to understand how can individuals solve “The Identity Nexus equation”?</p>
<p>Discussion Abstract:</p>
<p>As the world becomes increasingly digitized, personal data and identity management face new challenges from consumer opinion, regulations, and technology. In this informative session, I discuss the convergence of traditional organizational and people-centric approaches to personal data and identity management. Delving into the five domains of personal data, the dynamic landscape of personal data regulations, and new technologies that empower individuals to control and protect their data. I also introduce The Identity Nexus, and explore innovative strategies and tactics through a three-horizon framework that businesses can use to increase revenue, reduce costs, enhance customer experience, combat cybercrime, and comply with industry regulations. Check out the video to stay ahead of the curve in personal data and identity management.</p>

<p>In this post, Blazor and .NET 8 is used to implement a simple website. I took a .NET 7 project, updated it to .NET 8 and tried out some of the new features in .NET 8. </p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/Hostedblazor8Aad">https://github.com/damienbod/Hostedblazor8Aad</a></p>



<p></p>



 Setup 



<p>The project was setup using a .NET 7 project which implements an Azure AD authentication using best practice with a backend for frontend architecture and then updated to .NET 8. The security is implemented in the secure backend and the Blazor components are kept simple. The <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/Blazor.BFF.AzureAD.Template">Blazor.BFF.AzureAD.Template</a> template was used for this which takes care of all the project setup. At present no Microsoft template exists for implementing the security in this recommended way. The templates adds the security headers as best it can.</p>



<p>The project was updated to .NET 8 and all the Nuget packages as well.</p>


  &lt;TargetFramework&gt;net8.0&lt;/TargetFramework&gt;
  


<p>Microsoft.Identity.Web is used to implement the OpenID Connect confidential client. An Azure App registration was created for this with the Web client and a user secret. You could also use a certificate instead of a secret which improves the token request in the second step of the OIDC code flow authentication. </p>



<p></p>



<p>The application was started and like in .NET 7 we still have the annoying console warnings because the debugging tools try to add inline scripts to our code. The inline scripts are blocked by the CSP and this should be required for all deployments. I like to develop my application as close as possible to my target deployments, so I always develop with the best possible CSP and HTTPS like in the deployed applications. This prevents having to fix CSP issues when we go live or having to fix links to CSS CDNs or whatever. </p>



<p>We also have a warning in the console logs looking for a JS map file from something we do not use. No idea where or what adds to my development. </p>







<p></p>



 Creating Random data from Arrays 



<p>In .NET 8 GetItems() was added to System.Random. I decide to create my test data using this. I created an array of objects and returned this as a span.</p>


  public static ReadOnlySpan&lt;MyGridData&gt; GetData()
{
	return _mydata.AsSpan();
}
  


<p>The Random.Shared.GetItems method can be used to return n-items from my span in a random way. I set this to 24 items which can be then displayed in the Grid.</p>


  [HttpGet]
public IEnumerable&lt;MyGridData&gt; Get()
{
	return Random.Shared.GetItems(MyData.GetData(), 24);
}
  


 Using QuickGrid in Blazor 



<p>The QuickGrid  component was also added in .NET 8. This provides simple Grid features.</p>



<p>The Nuget package needs to be added to the client (WASM) project.</p>


  Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.QuickGrid
  


<p>The QuickGrid can be used in any Razor page in the WASM application. You need to add the using for the Grid and you can create the grid as required. The Grid has good documentation here:</p>



<p><a href="https://aspnet.github.io/quickgridsamples">https://aspnet.github.io/quickgridsamples</a></p>


  @page "/directapi"
@using HostedBlazorAad.Shared
@using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.QuickGrid
@inject IAntiforgeryHttpClientFactory httpClientFactory
@inject IJSRuntime JSRuntime

&lt;h3&gt;QuickGrid display using data  Direct API&lt;/h3&gt;

@if (myGridData == null)
{
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loading...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
}
else
{
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;QuickGrid Items="@FilteredItems" Pagination="@pagination"&gt;

    &lt;PropertyColumn Property="@(p =&gt; p.Id)" Sortable="true" /&gt;

    &lt;PropertyColumn Property="@(c =&gt; c.Name)" Sortable="true" Class="name"&gt;
        &lt;ColumnOptions&gt;
            &lt;div class="search-box"&gt;
                &lt;input type="search" autofocus @bind="nameFilter" @bind:event="oninput" placeholder="name..." /&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/ColumnOptions&gt;
    &lt;/PropertyColumn&gt;

    &lt;PropertyColumn Property="@(p =&gt; p.Colour)" Sortable="true" /&gt;
&lt;/QuickGrid&gt;

&lt;Paginator State="@pagination" /&gt;
}

@code {

    private IEnumerable&lt;MyGridData&gt;? myApiData;
    private IQueryable&lt;MyGridData&gt; myGridData = new List&lt;MyGridData&gt;().AsQueryable();
    private PaginationState pagination = new PaginationState { ItemsPerPage = 8 };
    private string nameFilter = string.Empty;

    GridSort&lt;MyGridData&gt; rankSort = GridSort&lt;MyGridData&gt;
        .ByDescending(x =&gt; x.Name)
        .ThenDescending(x =&gt; x.Colour)
        .ThenDescending(x =&gt; x.Id);

    IQueryable&lt;MyGridData&gt;? FilteredItems =&gt; myGridData.Where(x =&gt; x.Name.Contains(nameFilter, StringComparison.CurrentCultureIgnoreCase));

    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
    {
        var client = await httpClientFactory.CreateClientAsync();

        var myApiData = await client.GetFromJsonAsync&lt;MyGridData[]&gt;("api/DirectApi");

        if (myApiData != null) myGridData = myApiData.AsQueryable();
    }
}
  


<p>The 24 random items are displayed in the grid using a paging and a sort with eight items per page. The is client side and not server side paging which is important if using large amounts of data.</p>







<p></p>



 Notes 



<p>Blazor and .NET 8 will change a lot and new templates and project types are being created for Blazor and .NET 8. Blazor United or whatever it will be called after the release will be a new type of Blazor project and the 3 projects structure will probably be reduced down to one. I hope the security will be improved and I don’t understand why Microsoft still do security in the WASM part of the application when it is hosted in an ASP.NET Core backend. </p>

<p>
Welcome to episode 17 of the Steampipe+Mastodon series, in which we introduce a new subplot: timeline history. So far, the examples I’ve shown and discussed work with current timelines. We’ve seen SQL queries that fetch results from realtime calls to the Mastodon API, and Steampipe dashboards that display those results. But Steampipe isn’t just an API siphon, it’s also a Postgres database. As such it supports the transient tables created by Steampipe’s foreign data wrapper and plugins, but also enables you to create your own native tables as well. And you can use those native tables to accumulate data from the transient foreign tables.</p>
<p>
Because saving and searching Mastodon data is a controversial topic in the fediverse — none of us wants to recapitulate Big Social — I’ve focused thus far on queries that explore recent Mastodon flow, of which there are plenty more to write. But nobody should mind me remembering my own home timeline, so a few weeks ago I made a tool to read it hourly and add new toots to a Postgres table. </p>
<p>
Before you can add any toots to a table, of course, you’ve got to create that table. Here’s how I made this one.</p>
 create table mastodon_home_timeline as 
  select * from mastodon_toot_home limit 200
 
<p>
Once created, the table can be updated with new toots like so.</p>
 with data as (
  select
    account,
    -- more
    -- columns
    username
  from
    mastodon_toot_home
  limit 200
)
insert into mastodon_home_timeline (
  account,
    -- more
    -- columns
  username
)
select
  *
from 
  data
where 
  id not in ( select t.id from mastodon_home_timeline t )
 
<p>
To run that query from a crontab, on a machine where Steampipe is installed, save it as mastodon_home_timeline.sql, then schedule it.</p>
 15 * * * * cd /home/jon/mastodon; steampipe query mastodon_home_timeline.sql
 
<p>
That’s it! Now the number reported by select count(*) from mastodon_home_timeline is growing hourly.</p>
<p>
I’ve only been collecting toots for a couple of weeks, and haven’t yet begun to explore that data yet; we’ll see what happens when we get there. Meanwhile, though, I want to show how such exploration can be a team exercise. </p>
<p>
A friend of mine, whom I’ll call Elvis, shares my interest in teasing out connections among people, servers, and hashtags. He could capture his own timeline using the method shown here. But since we’ll be looking at this data together, we agreed that I’ll gather both our timelines. To enable that, he shared a (revokable) Mastodon API token that I’ve used to configure Steampipe with credentials for both our accounts.</p>
 connection "mastodon_social_jon" {
    plugin = "mastodon"
    server = "https://mastodon.social"
    access_token = "..."
}

connection "mastodon_social_elvis" {
    plugin = "mastodon"
    server = "https://mastodon.social"
    access_token = "..."
}
 
<p>
Steampipe’s foreign data wrapper turns each of these named connections into its own Postgres schema. Athough we happen to share the same home server, by the way, we needn’t. A team collaborating like this could pool timelines from mastodon.social and hachyderm.io and fosstodon.org and any other Mastodon-API-compatible server.</p>
<p>
(You can do the same thing with AWS or Slack or GitHub or other kind of account by defining <a href="https://steampipe.io/docs/managing/connections#querying-multiple-connections">multiple connections</a>. Steampipe makes API calls concurrently across parallel connections.)</p>
<p>
With this configuration I can read my timeline like so.</p>
 select * from mastodon_social_jon.mastodon_toot_home limit 200
 
<p>
And Elvis’ like so.</p>
 select * from mastodon_social_elvis.mastodon_toot_home limit 200
 
<p>
If I want to query both in realtime, for example to count the combined total, I can use a SQL UNION. Or I can define umbrella connection that <a href="https://steampipe.io/docs/managing/connections#using-aggregators">aggregates</a> these two.</p>
 connection "all_mastodon" {
    plugin = "mastodon"
    type = "aggregator"
    connections = [ "mastodon_social_jon", "mastodon_social_elvis" ]
}

connection "mastodon_social_jon" {
    plugin = "mastodon"
    server = "https://mastodon.social"
    access_token = "..."
}

connection "mastodon_social_elvis" {
    plugin = "mastodon"
    server = "https://mastodon.social"
    access_token = "..."
}
 
<p>
Now the query select * from all_mastodon.mastodon_toot_home limit 200 makes API calls on behalf of both accounts — in parallel — and combines the results. When we follow the resulting URLs in order to reply or boost, we’ll do so as individual identities. And we’ll be able to use Steampipe queries and dashboards in that same single-user mode. But we’ll also be able to pool our timelines and point our queries and dashboards at the combined history. </p>
<p>
Will that prove interesting? Useful? That remains to be seen. I think it’s one of many experiments worth trying as the fediverse sorts itself out. And I see Steampipe as one laboratory in which to run such experiments. With SQL as the abstraction over APIs, aggregation of connections, and <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3668032/visualizing-the-hacker-news-api-with-hcl-and-sql.html">dashboards as code</a>, you have all the ingredients needed to iterate rapidly, at low cost, toward shared Mastodon spaces tailored for teams or groups.</p>

Winter temperatures are often below 0°F (-18°C) and occasionally get as cold as -35°F (-37°C). We have a small baseboard heater in the pumphouse to keep things from freezing. That works pretty well, but one night last December, the temperature was -35°F and the power went out for five hours. I was in the dark, unable to know if the pumphouse was getting too cold. I determined that I needed a temperature sensor in the pumphouse that I could monitor remotely.</p>   <p>Thanks for reading Phil Windley's Technometria! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.</p>       <p>The biggest problem is that the pumphouse is not close to any structures with internet service. Wifi signals just don't make it out there. Fortunately, I've got some experience using <a href="https://lora-alliance.org/">LoraWAN</a>, a long-range (10km), low-power, wireless protocol. This use-case  seemed perfect for LoraWAN. About a year ago, I <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2022/04/easier_iot_deployments_with_lorawan_and_helium.shtml">wrote about how to use LoraWAN and a Dragino LHT65 temperature and humidity sensor</a>along with <a href="https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/overview">picos</a> to get temperature data over the Helium network.</p><p>I've installed a Helium hotspot near the pumphouse. The hotspot and internet router are both on battery backup. Helium provides a convenient console that allows you to register devices (like the LHT65) and configure flows to send the data from a device on the Helium network to some other system over HTTP. I created a pico to represent the pumphouse and routed the data from the LHT65 to a channel on that pico.</p><p>The pico does two things. First it processes the hearthbeat event that Helium sends to it, parsing out the parts I care about and raising another event so other rules can use the data. Processing the data is not simple because it's packed into a base64-encoded, 11-byte hex string. I won't bore you with the details, but it involves base64 decoding the string and splitting it into 6 hex values. Some of those a further packing data into specific bits of the 16-bit word, so binary operations are required. Those weren't built into the pico engine, so I added those libraries. If you're interested in the details of decoding, splitting, and unpacking the payload, check out the <code>receive_heartbeat </code>rule in <a href="https://github.com/windley/temperature-network/blob/main/io.picolabs.lht65.router.krl">this ruleset</a>.</p><p>Second, the <code>receive_heartbeat</code> rule raises the <code>lht65:new_readings</code> event in the pico adding all the relevant data from the LHT65 heartbeat. Any number of rules could react to that event depending on what needs to be done. For example, they could store the event, alarm on a threshold, or monitor the battery status. What I wanted to do is plot the temperature so I can watch it over time and let other members of the water group check it too. I found a nice service called <a href="https://iotplotter.com/">IoTPlotter</a> that provides a basic plotting service on any data you post to it. I created a feed for the pumphouse data and wrote a rule in my pumphouse pico to select on the <code>lht65:new_readings</code> event and <code>POST</code> the relevant data, in the right format, to IoTPlotter. Here's that rule:</p> <code>rule send_temperature_data_to_IoTPlotter {  
  select when lht65 new_readings

  pre {  
    feed_id = "367832564114515476";  
    api_key = meta:rulesetConfig{["api_key"]};  
    payload = {"data": {  
                  "device_temperature": [  
                    {"value": event:attrs{["readings", "internalTemp"]},  
                     "epoch": event:attrs{["timestamp"]}}  
                  ],  
                  "probe_temperature": [  
                    {"value": event:attrs{["readings", "probeTemp"]}, 
                     "epoch": event:attrs{["timestamp"]}}  
                  ],  
                  "humidity": [  
                    {"value": event:attrs{["readings", "humidity"]},  
                     "epoch": event:attrs{["timestamp"]}}  
                  ],  
                  "battery_voltage": [  
                    {"value": event:attrs{["readings", 
                                           "battery_voltage"]},  
                     "epoch": event:attrs{["timestamp"]}}  
                  ]}  
              };  
  }

  http:post("http://iotplotter.com/api/v2/feed/" + feed_id,  
     headers = {"api-key": api_key},  
     json = payload  
  ) setting(resp);  
}</code> <p>The rule, <code>send_temperature_data_to_IoTPlotter</code> is not very complicated. You can see that most of the work is just reformatting the data from the event attributes into the <a href="https://iotplotter.com/docs/?id=6ae07dbc091570630981c824">right structure for </a><a href="https://iotplotter.com/docs/?id=6ae07dbc091570630981c824">IoTPlotter</a>. The result is a <a href="https://iotplotter.com/user/feed/367832564114515476">set of plots</a> that looks like this:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F881da1f6-1b9f-4f14-9be9-9920b7089877_1712x1167.png">    </a> <p>Pretty slick. If you're interested in the data itself, you're seeing the internal temperature of the sensor (orange line) and temperature of an external probe (blue line). We have the temperature set pretty high as a buffer against power outages. Still, it's not using that much power because the structure is very small. Running the heater only adds about $5/month to the power bill. Pumping water is much more power intensive and is the bulk of the bill. The data is choppy because, by default, the LHT65 only transmits a payload once every 20 minutes. This can be changed, but at the expense of battery life.</p><p>This is a nice, evented system, albeit simple. The event flow looks like this:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F12b76ed9-95a3-4f65-8ecc-f9803f3e3142_1014x225.png">   </a>Event Flow for Pumphouse Temperature Sensor <p>I'll probably make this a bit more complete by adding a rule for managing thresholds and sending a text if the temperature gets too low or too high. Similarly, I should be getting notifications if the battery voltage gets too low. The battery is supposed to last 10 years, but that's exactly the kind of situation you need an alarm on—I'm likely to forget about it all before the battery needs replacing. I'd like to experiment with sending data the other way to adjust the frequency of readings. There might be times (like -35°F nights when the power is out) where getting more frequent results would reduce my anxiety.</p><p>This was a fun little project. I've got a bunch of these LHT65 temperature sensors, so I'll probably generalize this by turning the IoTPlotter ruleset into a module that other rulesets can use. I may eventually use a more sophisticated plotting package that can show me the data for all my devices on one feed. I bought a LoraWAN soil moisture probe for my garden. I've also got a solar array at my house that I'd like to monitor myself and that will need a dashboard of some kind. If you've got a sensor that isn't within easy range of wifi, then LoraWAN is a good solution. And event-based rules in picos are a convenient way to process the data.</p>   <p>Thanks for reading Phil Windley's Technometria!

<p>I thoroughly enjoyed wrapping up the event with Ann Li about Personal Data and Digital Identity Management. In our session, we discussed the importance of a new approach to personal data and identity management, and how it can unlock a new era of growth and consumer benefits for both organizations and customers. By embracing emerging decentralized strategies alongside existing centralized and federated ones, businesses can strategically add significant commercial and operational value while prioritizing the customer experience. Collaboration and participation within the ecosystem is also crucial in meeting the demands of our ever-evolving markets. Below is an abstract of out talk, and the session recording is above for those who couldn’t be there in person.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Personal Data and Digital Identity Management: A New Approach and Path to Value Personal data has underpinned growth across global economies for three decades and is now a systemically valuable resource. Personal data and identity management were two disparate yet connected subjects which are used to authenticate customers, drive research and insights, inform product strategies, mitigate fraud and other risks. A shift of customer attitudes, behaviors and regulation are placing individuals in greater control of their data and digital identity. This emerging data paradigm provides organizations an opportunity to access/unlock a new era of growth and consumer benefits for consumers and the organizations who serve them In this session, Ann Li, JP Morgan Chase’s Managing Director of International digital identity, investment strategy and partnerships, discusses JP Morgan Chase’s vision for a new approach to personal data and identity management and a new path to value. She will explore the importance of focusing on the individual and customer experience and how placing emerging decentralized personal data and identity strategies alongside existing centralized and federated ones have the potential—when embraced strategically—to add significant commercial and operational value to a business and people alike. She will also explore the imperative for collaborative ecosystem participation to meet the demands of our ever-evolving markets.</p>

<p>This post looks at onboarding users into an Azure DevOps team or project using Azure AD <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/governance/entitlement-management-access-package-create">access packages</a>. The Azure AD access packages are part of the Microsoft Entra Identity Governance and provide a good solution for onboarding internal or external users into your tenant with access to the defined resources.</p>



<p></p>



 Flow for onboarding Azure DevOps members 



<p>Sometimes we develop large projects with internal and external users which need access to an Azure DevOps project for a fixed length of time which can be extended if required. These users only need access to the the Azure DevOps project and should be automatically removed when the contract or project is completed. Azure AD access packages are a good way to implement this. </p>



 Use an Azure AD group 



<p>The access to the Azure DevOps can be implemented by using an Azure security group in Azure AD. This security will be used to add team members for the Azure DevOps project. Azure AD access packages are used to onboard users into the Azure AD group and the Azure DevOps project uses the security group to define the members. The “azure-devops-project-access-packages” security group was created for this.</p>



 Setup the Azure DevOps 



<p>A new Azure DevOps project was created for this demo. The project has an URL on the dev.azure.com domain. The Azure DevOps needs to be attached to the Azure AD tenant. Only an Azure AD member with the required permissions can add a security group to the Azure DevOps project.</p>







<p>My test Azure DevOps project was created with the following URL. You can only access this if you are a member.</p>



<p><a href="https://dev.azure.com/azureadgroup-access-packages/use-access-packages">https://dev.azure.com/azureadgroup-access-packages/use-access-packages</a></p>



<p>The project team can now be onboarded.</p>



 Create the Azure AD P2 Access packages 



<p>To create an Azure AD P2 Access package, you can use the Microsoft Entra admin center. The access package can be created in the Entitlement management blade. </p>







<p>Add the security group from the Azure AD which you use for adding or removing users to the Azure DevOps project. Add the users as members.</p>







<p></p>



<p>The users onboarded using the access package are given a lifespan in the tenant for the access and can be extended or not as needed.</p>







<p></p>



<p>The users can be added using an access package link, or you can get an admin to assign users to the package. I created a second access package to assign any users to the package which can then be approved or rejected by the Azure DevOps project manager. </p>







<p></p>



<p>The Azure DevOps administrator can approve the access package and the Azure DevOps team member can access the Azure DevOps project using the public URL. The new member is added to the Azure security group using the access package. </p>







<p>An access package link would look something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can insert icons&nbsp;into Microsoft 365 documents.

These icons are free to use and there’s no royalty or copyright to worry about.</p>
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/insert-icons-in-microsoft-365-e2459f17-3996-4795-996e-b9a13486fa79?ui=en-us&amp;rs=en-us&amp;ad=us">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/insert-icons-in-microsoft-365-e2459f17-3996-4795-996e-b9a13486fa79?ui=en-us&amp;rs=en-us&amp;ad=us</a></blockquote>



<p>In addition, …</p>



<blockquote>
<p>You may sell a spreadsheet, database, or PowerPoint deck you made using Microsoft software. The spreadsheet, database, or PowerPoint deck must be created using legitimate, licensed Microsoft software.</p>

<p>Finally, …</p>



<blockquote>
<p>What am I allowed to use premium creative content for?<br>Excel for Microsoft 365&nbsp;Word for Microsoft 365&nbsp;Outlook for Microsoft 365&nbsp;PowerPoint for Microsoft 365&nbsp;PowerPoint for the web&nbsp;SharePoint in Microsoft 365</p>



<p><br>If you’re a Microsoft 365 subscriber you have access to thousands of royalty-free images, icons, and more that you can use in your documents, presentations, workbooks, and SharePoint in Microsoft 365. But you may have questions about what you’re legally allowed to do with that creative content. This article will try to answer that!</p>



<p>You can use the content for anything permitted by the applicable Microsoft 365 license so you should review your End-User License Agreement (EULA) to understand exactly what you can do with works created in Microsoft 365 and SharePoint.</p>



<p>Simply put… You can use the premium images and other creative content however you see fit, as long as it’s within an Microsoft 365 app or SharePoint site. For commercial customers, this includes selling PowerPoint slide decks, Excel workbooks, or Word documents that include this content, just as you would have sold these files in the past.</p>



<p>This includes exporting the Microsoft 365 file to another format. You can modify the picture, use it in the file forever, and use it anywhere in the world. Basically, do the same things that you would have done with Microsoft 365 documents in the past, but now you can include the stock images and other content from the Insert Pictures dialog.</p>

<p>I reveal the secrets of PIMS and the Personal Information Economy in my recent MEF Global Forum session. Encouraging organizations to consider incorporating a PIMS into their strategy as a critical next step. Below is the abstract of what I covered in my session, and if you unfortunately missed this prolific event you can watch the session recording above.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Personal Information Management Solutions (PIMS) is an emerging capability that gives organizations a new and improved way of managing personal data and identity. Drawing from my qualitative study of twenty U.S. consumers, I share insights on the the key factors that influence an individual’s interest, ability, and intention to use a PIMS. These insights&nbsp;can inform corporate strategy, product roadmaps, and ecosystem partnerships, and learn how PIMS can improve trust, efficiency, and product/service experience. Finally giving individuals the opportunity to reclaim their agency, manage their privacy, and establish more authentic relationships with those organizations they trust.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITffDdp-q1w&amp;t=32452s"></a></p>
<p>Enterprises and organizations alike have a new path to value creation, the adoption and integration of a personal information management solution (PIMS). PIMS support a decentralized data strategy–think self-sovereign identity, Web 3.0, and Web 5.0 all wrapped up in one. PIMS is a general term for software and services that restructures how personal data is collected and used throughout an organization.</p>
<p>A PIMS can help organizations re-frame their relationship with individuals, improve transparency, build trust, streamline onboarding and customer engagement, increase regulatory compliance, reduce costs, mitigate risks, and more. For individuals, a PIMS promises to give them agency over their data, protect their privacy, increase online and offline efficiency and convenience, and achieve peace of mind. The time for PIMS is now!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITffDdp-q1w&amp;t=30771s"></a></p>
<p>As of January 2023, the world is more connected than ever before, with over 800 mobile operators spanning 200 countries. The use of mobile devices has become ubiquitous, with 68% of the world’s population (5.44 billion people) relying on mobile phones, and over 8.46 billion mobile connections (excluding Internet of Things devices) worldwide. Mobile technology is revolutionizing the way people work, play, socialize, shop, and access essential services like banking and healthcare.</p>
<p>I was accompanied in this discussion by a panel of experts, including Nilay Kumar, Vice President of mFilterit, Noah Rafalko, CEO of TSG Global, Glyn Povah, Founder &amp; Director Global Product Development of Smart Digits at Telefonica, Gautam Hazari, Chief Technology Officer of Sekura Mobile Intelligence, and Teodor Magureanu, Chief of Staff of VOX Solutions. Helping spread awareness that everyone has a role to play in ensuring the safety and security of mobile channels. They provided fascinating insights on the latest trends, technologies, and strategies for carriers, enterprises, brands, regulators, solution providers, and individuals to succeed in the mobile world. However, ensuring the safety and security of mobile users is a top priority for everyone involved in the mobile ecosystem.</p>

<p><a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/">Bluesky</a>, a new social media platform and <a href="https://atproto.com/">AT Protocol</a>, is unsurprisingly running up against the same challenges and limitations that Flickr, Twitter and many other social media platforms faced in the 2000s: passwords!</p>

<p></p>

<p>You wouldn't give your Gmail password to Yelp, right? Why should you give your Bluesky password to random apps either!</p>

<p>The current official Bluesky iOS application unsurprisingly works by logging in with a username and password. It's the easiest form of authentication to implement, even if it is the least secure. Since Bluesky and the AT Protocol are actually intending on creating an entire ecosystem of servers and clients, this is inevitably going to lead to a complete security disaster. In fact, we're already seeing people spin up prototype Bluesky clients, sharing links around to them, which result in users being taught that there's nothing wrong with handing out their account passwords to random website and applications that ask for them. Clearly there has to be a solution, right?</p>

<p>The good news is there has been a solution that has existed for about 15 years -- OAuth! This is exactly the problem that OAuth was created to solve. How do we let third party applications access data in a web service without sharing the password with that application.</p>

<p>What's novel about Bluesky (and other similarly decentralized and open services like WordPress, Mastodon, Micro.blog, and others), is that there is an expectation that any user should be able to bring any client to any server, without prior relationships between client developers and servers. This is in contrast to consumer services like Twitter and Google, where they limit which developers can access their API by going through a developer registration process. I wrote more about this problem in a previous blog post, <a href="https://aaronparecki.com/2018/07/07/7/oauth-for-the-open-web">OAuth for the Open Web</a>.</p>

<p>There are two separate problems that Bluesky can solve with <a href="https://oauth.net">OAuth</a>, especially a flavor of OAuth like <a href="https://indieauth.net">IndieAuth</a>.</p>

 
 How apps can access data in the user's Personal Data Server (PDS) 
 How the user logs in to their PDS 
 

 How apps can access the user's data 

<p>This is the problem OAuth solved when it was originally created, and the problem ATProto currently has. It's obviously very unsafe to have users give their PDS password to every third party application that's created, especially since the ecosystem is totally open so there's no way for a user to know how legitimate a particular application is. OAuth solves this by having the application redirect to the OAuth server, the user logs in there, and then the application gets only an access token.</p>

<p>ATProto already uses <a href="https://atproto.com/lexicons/com-atproto-session">access tokens and refresh tokens</a>, (although they strangely call them <code>accessJwt</code> and <code>refreshJwt</code>) so this is a small leap to make. OAuth support in mobile apps has gotten a lot better than it was 10 years ago, and there is first class support for this pattern on iOS and Android to make the experience work better than the much older plain redirect model used to work a decade ago.</p>

<p>Here is what the rough experience the user would see when logging in to an app:</p>

<p></p>

 
 The user launches the app and taps the "Sign In" button 
 The user enters their handle or server name (e.g. <code>jay.bsky.social</code>, <code>bsky.social</code>, or <code>aaronpk.com</code>) 
 The app discovers the user's OAuth server, and launches an in-app browser 
 The user lands on their own PDS server, and logs in there (however they log in is not relevant to the app, it could be with a password, via email magic link, a passkey, or even delegated login to another provider) 
 The user is presented with a dialog asking if they want to grant access to this app (this step is optional, but it's up to the OAuth server whether to do this and what it looks like) 
 The application receives the authorization code and exchanges it at the PDS for an access token and refresh token 
 

<p><br></p>

<p>Most of this is defined in the core OAuth specifications. The part that's missing from OAuth is:</p>

 
 discovering an OAuth server given a server name 
 and how clients should be identified when there is no client preregistration step. 
 

<p>That's where <a href="https://indieauth.net">IndieAuth</a> fills this in. With IndieAuth, the user's authorization server is discovered by fetching the web page at their URL. IndieAuth avoids the need for client registration by also using URLs as OAuth <code>client_id</code>s.</p>

<p>This does mean IndieAuth assumes there is an HTML document hosted at the URL the user enters, which works well for web based solutions, and might even work well for Bluesky given the number of people who have already rushed to set their Bluesky handle to the same URL as their personal website. But, long term it might be an additional burden for people who want to bring their own domain to Bluesky if they aren't also hosting a website there.</p>

<p>There's a new discussion happening in the OAuth working group to enable this kind of authorization server discovery from a URL which could rely on DNS or a well-known endpoint. This is in-progress work at the IETF, and I would love to have ATProto/Bluesky involved in those discussions!</p>

 How the user logs in to their PDS 

<p>Currently, the AT Protocol specifies that login happens with a username and password to get the tokens the app needs. Once clients start using OAuth to log in to apps, this method can be dropped from the specification, which interestingly opens up a lot of new possibilities.</p>

<p>Passwords are inherently insecure, and there has been a multi-year effort to improve the security of every online service by adding two-factor authentication and even moving away from passwords entirely by using <a href="https://oauth.net/passkeys/">passkeys</a> instead.</p>

<p>Imagine today, Bluesky wants to add multifactor authenticaiton to their current service. There's no good way to add this to the existing API, since the Bluesky client will send the password to the API and expect an access token immediately. If Bluesky switches to an OAuth flow described above, then the app never sees the password, which means the Bluesky server can start doing more fun things with multifactor auth as well as even passwordless flows!</p>

 Logging in with a passkey 

<p>Here is the same sequence of steps but this time swapping out the password step for a passkey.</p>

<p></p>

 
 The user launches the app and taps the "Sign In" button 
 The user enters their handle or server name (e.g. <code>jay.bsky.social</code>, <code>bsky.social</code>, or <code>aaronpk.com</code>) 
 The app discovers the user's OAuth server, and launches an in-app browser 
 The user lands on their own PDS server, and logs in there with a passkey 
 The user is presented with a dialog asking if they want to grant access to this app (this step is optional, but it's up to the OAuth server whether to do this and what it looks like) 
 The application receives the authorization code and exchanges it at the PDS for an access token and refresh token 
 

<p>This is already a great improvement, and the nice thing is app developers don't need to worry about implementing passkeys, they just need to implement OAuth! The user's PDS implements passkeys and abstracts that away by providing the OAuth API instead.</p>

 Logging in with IndieAuth 

<p>Another variation of this would be if the Bluesky service itself supported delegating logins instead of managing any passwords or passkeys at all.</p>

<p>Since Bluesky already supports users setting their handle to their own personal website, it's a short leap to imaging allowing users to authenticate themselves to Bluesky using their website as well!</p>

<p>That is the exact problem IndieAuth already solves, with quite a few implementations in the wild of services that are IndieAuth providers, including <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a>, a <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/indieauth/">WordPress plugin</a>, a <a href="https://drupal.org/project/indieweb">Drupal module</a>, and many options for <a href="https://indieweb.org/IndieAuth#Server_Implementations">self-hosting</a> and endpoint.</p>

<p>Let's look at what the sequence would look like for a user to use the bsky.social PDS with their custom domain handle mapped to it.</p>

<p></p>

 
 The user launches the app and taps the "Sign In" button 
 The user enters their server name (e.g. <code>bsky.social</code>) 
 The app discovers the OAuth server and launches an in-app browser 
 The user enters their handle, and bsky.social determines whether to prompt for a password or do an IndieAuth flow to their server 
 The user is redirected to their own website (IndieAuth server) and authenticates there, and is then redirected back to bsky.social 
 The user is presented by bsky.social with a dialog asking if they want to grant access to this app 
 The application receives the authorization code and exchanges it at the PDS for an access token and refresh token 
 

<p>This is very similar to the previous flows, the difference being that in this version, bsky.social is the OAuth server as far as the app is concerned. The app never sees the user's actual IndieAuth server at all.</p>

 Further Work 

<p>These are some ideas to kick off the discussion of improving the security of Bluesky and the AT Protocol. Let me know if you have any thoughts on this! There is of course a lot more detail to discuss about the specifics, so if you're interested in diving in, a good place to start is reading up on <a href="https://oauth.net">OAuth</a> as well as the <a href="https://indieauth.net">IndieAuth</a> extension to OAuth which has solved some of the problems that exist in the space.</p>

<a href="https://www.platformer.news/">Platformer</a> reports he has e-mail confirmation from
<a href="https://meta.com/">Meta</a> that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Meta is] exploring a standalone decentralized social network for sharing text

<blockquote>
<p>… will support ActivityPub, the decentralised social networking protocol powering

</blockquote>
<p>It will also:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>be Instagram-branded and will allow users to register/login to the app through their
Instagram credentials.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First, the good news:</p>
<p>This is a huge validation of the decentralized social network
known as the Fediverse, built around a set of internet protocol standards that include
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub">ActivityPub</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activity_Streams_(format)">ActivityStreams</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebFinger">WebFinger</a> as well as a set of commonly
implemented unofficial extensions. The Fediverse has been around for some years, but
recently came to more widespread prominence through its leading implementation,
<a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a>, as the leading alternative of increasingly erratic
(and increasingly many other things, but I digress…) Twitter.</p>
<p>That’s because only when alternatives are actually beginning to look like they might become serious
threats to incumbents – and Meta is the market-leading incumbent in social media by far – do
incumbents start paying attention and then connect to them. Or, as it may be the case here,
simply leak that they might be connecting in the future but never actually will. We don’t know
which of those will turn out to be true, but it doesn’t matter: both validate
the Fediverse as a serious competitor to Meta.</p>
<p>This is on the heels of recent Fediverse adoption by companies such as
<a href="https://mozilla.social/">Mozilla</a>, <a href="https://me.dm/">Medium</a>,
<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/welcome-to-wildebeest-the-fediverse-on-cloudflare/">CloudFlare</a>
and <a href="https://about.flipboard.com/inside-flipboard/flipboard-mastodon-federated/">Flipboard</a>.
Apple now has Mastodon
<a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/02/16/ios-16-4-imessage-rich-previews-for-mastodon-posts/">content previews in iMessage</a>.
Even Microsoft <a href="https://dotnet.social/@dotnet/109990445819820814">has been spotted</a>
in the Fediverse a few days ago.</p>
<p>But:</p>
<p>I have some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Bridge#Culture">Brooklyn Bridges for sale</a>.
You get a Brooklyn Bridge for free if you believe that a company like Meta would
connect to the Fediverse, and be a perfect citizen the way the Fediverse expects you
to be today. Including:</p>
 
 No ads; 
 No tracking; 
 No algorithms that favor business outcomes for Meta over your wellbeing; 
 Respect for different cultures, minorities, non-mainstream behavior etc.; 
 A rich toolset for filtering and blocking according what you decide you want to
filter and block, not Meta; 
 The ability to <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/moving/">move from one host to another</a>
without having to build your network from scratch; 
 The ability to pick who is your system administrator and moderator, from models
that are essential centrally managed to full-fledged self-managed, user-owned
<a href="https://social.coop/">cooperatives</a>; 
 The ability, and encouragement, to innovate with new apps; 
 and so forth. 
 
<p>Instead, based on the history of technology, the chances are overwhelming that such an app
would be used by Meta with an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend,_and_extinguish">embrace, extend and extinguish strategy</a>,
at the end of which the Fediverse would either have become irrelevant or effectively
been taken over by Meta. So the much-heralded alternative to Twitter would become …
Meta? I sure hope not.</p>
<p>If you think that is unlikely, read up on some of the historical examples
listed on that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend,_and_extinguish">Wikipedia page</a>.
Merely being based on open standards and having a million+ strong user community does not
protect you at all. Instead, I would say the attack happens every single time a network
dominated by an incumbent (here: social media) is threatened by a more open network. And it
succeed, at least partially, more often than not. Here it is Meta’s $100b+ business that’s
under strategic threat, of course they will protect it and use any means they can think of
to do so.</p>
<p>It does not help that the Fediverse today is chronically underfunded and has corresponding
difficulty to compete at the same speed as somebody like Meta can. Actually, “unfunded”
is a better term because the amounts are so small. There are many unpaid contributions,
the Fediverse largely being open source and all, but I’d be surprised if more than $10m per year
are spent in total on the entire Fediverse today, likely it’s far less. If Meta can burn
more than $10b – that’s one entire annual fediverse spend every 8 hours! –
on a very doubtful Metaverse project, they surely could find the same amount of money to
protect their core business.</p>
<p>And that’s just one of the many issues we need to solve to protect, and grow, the beautiful
thing we currently have with the Fediverse.</p>
<p>So what shall we do about all this?</p>
<p>(I welcome your comments – in the Fediverse! Find me at <a href="https://social.coop/@J12t">@j12t@social.coop</a>.)</p>
<p>(Also, I’m co-organizing <a href="https://fediforum.org">FediForum</a>, an online unconference at
the end of March, where we will surely discuss this and other issues. And celebrate the
Fediverse, because there is much to celebrate! Join us?)</p>

<p>Welcome to the latest installment in the KERI Tutorial Series! In a <a href="https://kentbull.com/2023/01/27/keri-tutorial-series-kli-sign-and-verify-with-heartnet/">prior article</a> we learned how to use KERI to sign and verify simple messages. This tutorial goes to the full depth of issuing and verifying credentials (ACDCs).</p>



<p>We outfit our team of explorers bound on a treasure hunting journey with high tech security tags so the Gatekeeper will recognize them and permit them entrance into the most rewarding, yet dangerous, caverns of the secret underground chambers beneath the Osireion at Abydos. </p>



 Egyptian Story Time 



<p>An ancient city in Egypt from the time of the Pharaohs Abydos has long been known as a burial and memorial site for the ancient rulers. Yet, until recently, what had been kept a secret is the true purpose of Abydos and the Osireion, an entrance to an underground world full of bounty and treasure where the Egyptian rulers stored their most precious things. </p>



<p>Even with this revelation few could master the secret of how to travel between the Osireion and this underground world. Only two ever reliably figured it out, first the wise Ramiel and then his strong student Zaqiel. After they retrieved all the riches and treasure they wanted they realized they had an opportunity on their hands as guides for future explorers. Thus ATHENA was born.</p>



 

 Check out the 5 minute intro to this post and the ATHENA Network tutorial series!



 Opportunity 



<p>To establish a new standard in treasure hunting trust, and to capitalize on their opportunity, Ramiel and Zaqiel formed the Abydos Treasure Hunting Expedition Navigators Assembly (ATHENA) and began looking for a technology partner to build their Journey Mark trust system. Ramiel took on the role of the Wise Man to evaluate, grant marks to, and guide treasure hunters to Abydos while Zaqiel, the stronger of the two, took on the role of the Osireion Gatekeeper to ensure only those accepted by Ramiel would be given the opportunity to learn to travel to the underground world.</p>



 What ATHENA seeks to create 



<p>According to ATHENA, explorers desiring entrance through the Osireion must present a verifiable, secure proof signed by the Wise Man in order to be accepted by the Gatekeeper. Potential explorers must signify their intent to embark on a journey by presenting the Wise Man with another secure proof. </p>



<p>The diagram below shows the end state of their desired network.</p>


 
 


<p>On a practical note, get some refreshments and settle in as this post is large and contains many parts. It may take a few sessions to fully absorb the material depending on your existing familiarity with KERI and ACDC and the related Github repositories.</p>



 You meet the two 



<p>So how did you ever come to meet up with Ramiel and Zaqiel at ATHENA? It turns out the story is more believable than you might think.</p>


 
 


<p>While on a casual stroll at the Internet Identity Workshop (IIW) you had the good fortune of bumping into Ramiel and Zaqiel and they asked you how you would build the ATHENA security system. Since you had just left Dr. Samuel Smith’s session on composable event streaming representation (CESR) and had earlier been to Drummond Reed’s session KERI for Muggles where you learned about key event receipt infrastructure (KERI) and authentic chained data containers (ACDC), you realized they were the best decentralized key management infrastructure (DKMI) available and figured this would be the right tool to get the job done for ATHENA.</p>


 
 


<p>After hearing the details from Ramiel you became excited about the opportunity. You enthusiastically shook hands with them and began your work. Then, feeling a little in over your head and hoping for a concise and useful guide on KERI and ACDC to get you started on your development path, you hear Kaliya Identity Woman Young casually mention a link in the session notes she hounded the session presenter to write down. Grateful for her efforts you began to feel a sense of relief as you turned to the IIW QiQo site and found this blog post. A rush of hope and encouragement came and you dug in realizing you found the KERI manual you needed to get a simple prototype up and running.</p>



<p>Your job is to make this all happen.</p>



 What you can expect to learn 



 
 All of the components that are required for a basic KERI network including configuration 



 ACDC Credential Schema Creation, Issuance, and Revocation 



 KERI Command Line Interface (kli) and the (now deprecated) KERI Mark I Agent REST API  



 To learn about the KERIpy code. There are multiple references to important parts of the KERIpy codebase strewn throughout this tutorial. 



 A fair bit about BASH scripting if you read through the workflow.sh script.

<p>Ramiel the Wise Man</p>


 
 


<p>Zaqiel the Gatekeeper</p>


 
 


<p>Now that you’ve met the team let’s get going. We have a lot to do!</p>



 Outline 



<p>As you can see we start with a visual of where we are going, cover concepts briefly, perform environment setup, and then a quick review of major terminology, and it is off to the races with the admittance workflow. From schema writing to network setup and finally to issuance, presentation, and revocation this tutorial takes you through the basics for using KERI and ACDC.</p>

 Going to the Osireion at Abydos 


 
 


 Our Task 



 
 Create the network foundation. 



 Create digital identities for each involved party. 



 Give a verifiable journey description to each interested explorer. 



 Request a Journey Mark for each explorer from the Wise Man. 



 As the Wise Man issue the Journey Mark to each member of the explorer party. 



 Present the Journey Marks to the Gatekeeper and grant access to the Osireion at Abydos. 
 



 Environment Setup 



<p>Check your environment-specific platform installation instructions for additional clarity though use the “All Platforms” list for a list of dependencies that ultimately must be installed on your machine and available from the command line.</p>



 All Platforms 



 
 Python 3.10+ required 



 Download the <a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial.git">Abydos Tutorial repository</a> with all of the example code:<br><code>$ git clone https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial</code> 



 Install Rust (for the blake3 dependency KERIpy dependson and builds)<br><code>$</code> <code>curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | bash -s -- -y &amp;&amp; source "$HOME/.cargo/env"</code> 



 Install Maturin (for package management one of KERIpy’s dependencies uses)<br><code>$</code> <code>pip install maturin</code> 



 Install KERIpy at least version 0.6.9: <a href="https://pypi.org/project/keri/">https://pypi.org/project/keri/</a><br>You can’t do a regular <code>pip install keri==0.6.8</code> because you need a few changes I submitted that got into 0.6.9 and 1.0.0<br>So install from source by doing a <br><code>$</code> <code>git clone https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy</code> <br>And then <br><code>$</code> <code>cd keripy</code><br>and <br><code>$</code> <code>python -m pip install -e./</code><br>This will give you the latest version which should be 1.0.0.<br>The 1.0.0 version hasn’t been released to PyPi yet though will be soon. 



 Install KASLCred: <a href="https://pypi.org/project/kaslcred/">https://pypi.org/project/kaslcred/</a><br><code>$</code> <code>pip install kaslcred</code> 



 Install at least version 0.6.1 of the <a href="https://github.com/kentbull/sally">kentbull/sally</a> fork of GLEIF-IT/sally.
 
 <code>$</code> <code>git clone https://github.com/kentbull/sally.git</code><br><code>$</code> <code>cd sally</code><br><code>$</code> <code>python -m pip install -e ./</code> 
 
 



 Libsodium
 
 <a href="https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/installation">https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/installation</a> 



 On my MacBook Pro I ended up having to do the full installation:
 
 Download a tarball from the <a href="https://download.libsodium.org/libsodium/releases/">releases page</a>.<br>Change directories to within the decompressed tarball.<br><code>$</code> <code>./configure</code><br><code>$</code> <code>make &amp;&amp; make check</code><br><code>$</code> <code>sudo make install</code> 
 
 
 
 



 vLEI credential caching server (vLEI-server)
 
 <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/vLEI.git">https://github.com/WebOfTrust/vLEI.git</a> 



 Clone the repository and do a Pip install<br><code>$ git clone https://github.com/WebOfTrust/vLEI.git</code><br><code>$ cd vLEI</code><br><code>$ python -m pip install -e ./</code> 
 
 
 



 OS X 



 
 With <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>: Install Python 3.10+, Python 3 PIP, Python 3 Venv, Libsodium-dev, maturin, and the Rust toolchain
 
 Installing Python 3.10+ on a Mac is a rather involved process since the operating system default installation can interfere with things. <br>Use the following freeCodeCamp guide to install “pyenv” and then install Python 3 on top of that: <br><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-version-on-mac-update/">How to Install Python 3 on Mac – Brew Install Update Tutorial</a> 



 <code>$ brew install libsodium</code> # warning, doesn’t work.<br># See above instructions on libsodium installation from the tarball to get things working on a Mac. You need Libsodium on your path, which <code>sudo make install</code> does. 



 <code>$ pip install maturin</code> # if you haven’t already 
 
 



 Install KERI
 
 <code>$ git clone git clone https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy.git</code> 



 <code>$ cd keripy</code> 



 <code>$ python -m pip install -e ./</code> 
 
 



 Verify your installation
 
 <code>$ kli version</code> 



 This should output something like “0.6.8”, “0.6.9”, or “1.0.0”. 
 
 
 



 Windows 



<p>Thanks to Jim Martin for providing these Windows instructions.</p>



<p>See the <a href="https://kentbull.com/2023/01/27/keri-tutorial-series-kli-sign-and-verify-with-heartnet/#windows-manual-setup">Manual Setup with Windows</a> section of the KLI with Heartnet tutorial for instructions on setting up KERI on Windows.</p>



 Jump to the end with the <code>workflow.sh</code> script 



<p>If you want to quickly start up a network rather than working through the entire blog post piece by piece then you can use the <code>workflow.sh</code> script to start the whole network and perform all of the actions including schema linking, configuration file writing, witness network startup, controller configuration and startup, OOBI configuration, credential issuance, and credential revocation.</p>



<p>The workflow script accepts a few different ways of running it:</p>



 <code># from within the abydos-tutorial directory

#
# Option 1: run with the KLI and no clearing
./workflow.sh

# this will run the entire workflow yet will not clean up the ~/.keri, 
# ~/.sally, or the /usr/local/var/keri directories so you will need
# to manually clear those out in order to run the workflow script again.

#
# Option 2: run with the KLI and the clearing option
./workflow.sh -c true

# this runs the entire workflow using the KLI and clears out the KERI 
# directories mentioned above

#
# Option 3: run with the KERI Agent (Mark I - deprecated) and the
#           clearing option
./workflow.sh -a true -c true

# this runs the workflow using the KLI only where absolutely necessary
# and then cURL requests to the Agent API to perform the majority of the 
# workflow</code> 



<p>This is a great way to get you up and running. The entire workflow takes only 3 minutes for the KLI flow and 2.5 minutes for the Agent workflow. Reading through the BASH script may be the fastest way for you to learn how to use KERI if you are ready for that level of detail.</p>



 ATHENA Network 



<p>The ATHENA network includes:</p>



 
 three witnesses 



 four controllers (with one custom controller, the Abydos Gatekeeper) 



 four agents, one for each controller (Mark I Agent – deprecated) 



 a credential caching server 



 four distinct credential types. 



 a webhook 
 



<p>You will, of course, set up all of the configuration files and keystores for each witness and controller as well as perform all of the OOBI configuration for the network to function. See below for an overview.</p>



 Network Overview 


 
 


 Controllers 



<p>There is one controller each for Richard, Elayne, Zaqiel, and Ramiel. You will write the configuration files for each controller and create and incept their keystores.</p>



 Custom Controller 



<p>The one custom controller is the one for Zaqiel, the Abydos Gatekeeper controller. This controller needs to be customized in order to make the access control decisions for Abydos. This includes custom credential validators and presentation response payload constructors.</p>



 Witnesses 



<p>The same three witnesses are used for all of the controllers. Using the same witnesses for everything isn’t required and would be bad practice, though it simplifies the architecture for this post. You could easily use separate witnesses per controller with just a bit more tedious work. You will write the witness configuration files for each witness and set them up using the KLI.</p>



 Credential Caching Server 



<p>The vLEI-server from the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/vLEI">vLEI repository</a> is used as the credential caching server. It is a very simple HTTP fileserver that serves up ACDC schemas upon HTTP request. It would easily be implementable in any other language or tech stack if you needed it to be.</p>



 Agents 



<p>The agents use the current agent code in the KERIpy repository, called the Mark I Agent. This agent code is now deprecated even though it is nearly fully fleshed out. The new Mark II Agent is being developed as a separate repository in the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keria">KERIA repository</a>.</p>



 Webhook 



<p>The webhook is a simple HTTP server built on the <a href="https://github.com/ioflo/hio">ioflo/hio</a> library executed with <code>sally hook demo</code>. All it does is receive HTTP requests from the Abydos Gatekeeper custom controller, parse the JSON body, and print all of the headers and body values.</p>



 Foundational Vocabulary and Theory 



<p>Next we cover some basic vocabulary and acronyms so you can make your way through this post. I recommend you review Nuttawut Kongsuwan’s KERI jargon <a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#de18">summary</a> of the KERI whitepaper for an overview of the terminology in the space. You can always go to the <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf">KERI Whitepaper</a> or my <a href="https://kentbull.com/2022/06/05/keri-start/">KERI Mind Map blog post</a> as well for a list of documents central to the KERI space that will assist you in gaining a full understanding of the concepts and the terminology.</p>



<p><a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#48aa">KERI</a> – Key Event Receipt Infrastructure. A decentralized public key infrastructure for self certifying identifiers aiming at security as a top priority while following the design principle of “minimally sufficient means.” The foundation for the verifiable credentials technology called authentic chained data containers.</p>



<p><a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#7344">AID</a> -autonomic identifier. a self-certifying identifier that is the primary root of trust in KERI. AIDs are decentralized identifiers that do not rely on a blockchain.</p>



<p><a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#2627">Controller</a> – a node or an individual set of cryptographic keys, their key event logs (KELs), and associated data. Consists of a keystore directory, a set of autonomic identifiers (AIDs), key event logs, any credentials, transaction event logs, and out of band introductions.<br>Also considered to be a running instance of a KERI controller software such as <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy">KERIpy</a> (Python KERI controller) or <a href="https://github.com/THCLab/keriox">KERIox</a> (Rust KERI controller).</p>



<p><a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#a998">Witness</a> – a trusted entity designated by another controller as a witness to anything that happens for an AID controlled by that controller. Each witness must provide witness receipts to each event in a key event log. </p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy">KERIpy</a> – the Python implementation of KERI including the  controller implementation. This Python implementation is considered authoritative as the KERI core team builds it along with Dr. Samuel M. Smith. </p>



<p>Agent – The HTTP API to a KERI controller.</p>



<p>OOBI – out of band introduction. The core discovery mechanism of KERI. Each OOBI defines a path of communication between controllers or a location where a resource like an ACDC schema resides. Think of this as something like a DNS entry or an iptables entry, or an address in an address book. If you have an OOBI for a controller or object you want to talk to then you can reach it over the internet.</p>



<p>ACDC – authentic chained data container; verifiable credential. The fundamental unit of data shared between KERI controllers meant for instrumenting business process workflows that use verifiable credentials.<br>An append-only, graph-linked data structure that is secure and verifiable.</p>



<p>Edge – a link (or chain) between two ACDCs. </p>



<p>ACDC Schema – the detailed description of precisely what data is allowed to be placed into any given ACDC.</p>



<p>Credential Registry – where ACDCs are issued from.</p>



<p>Ricardian Contract – In ACDCs they are a way to link the legal system to specific ACDCs. This comes in the Rules section of ACDCs.</p>



 Admittance Workflow 



<p>The purpose of all of this business about identifiers and credentials is to support a basic admittance workflow into Abydos, specifically the Osireion at the back of Abydos. In order to support this workflow we use verifiable credentials.</p>



 Credentials Overview 



<p>For the explorers to be granted admittance into Abydos the admittance workflow must be followed:</p>



 
 The Wise Man must issue TreasureHuntingJourney credentials to each explorer wishing to go on a treasure hunt to Abydos. 



 Each explorer must issue a JourneyMarkRequest credential for the treasure hunt they want to embark on by pointing to a specific TreasureHuntingJourney credential in their request. 



 As the Wise Man approves each explorer he is to issue a JourneyMark as an approval of the explorer’s desire to embark on the journey. This approval should point to the specific request each explorer made for a specific journey. 



 Once a sufficient number of JourneyMark credentials are issued by the Wise Man and the journey threshold has been crossed he is to issue a JourneyCharter to each explorer signifying his approval of their journey. 



 The JourneyCharter credential is to be presented by each explorer to the Gatekeeper in order to be granted entrance into Abydos. 
 



<p>To understand this workflow we first cover the credential map itself, how to write a credential, and how to link each of the schemas together using the KASLCred tool.</p>



 Visual workflows and use cases for credential issuance 



<p>Each of the credential issuance flows is described visually below.</p>



 1 – TreasureHuntingJourney issuance flow 



<p>As a Wise Man (ATHENA official) I want to provide confidence to potential explorers so that I may attract them to go on a treasure hunting journey.</p>



<p>To do this the WiseMan issues the TreasureHuntingJourney credential.</p>


 
 


 2 – JourneyMarkRequest issuance flow 



<p>As an Explorer I want to indicate a serious interest on a specific TreasureHuntingJourney so that ATHENA will hold my spot.</p>



<p>To do this an Explorer (or Librarian) issues to the WiseMan a JourneyMarkRequest pointing to a specific TreasureHuntingJourney credential.</p>


 
 


 3 – JourneyMark issuance flow 



<p>As a Wise Man I want to endorse a particular Explorer for a specific TreasureHuntingJourney so that the journey can be chartered once a threshold of party membership is reached.</p>



<p>To do this the Wise Man issues the JourneyMark to those Explorers whose JourneyMarkRequests he approves. The JourneyMark points to the specific JourneyMarkRequest submitted by an explorer.</p>


 
 


 4 – JourneyCharter issuance flow 



<p>As a Wise Man I want to charter a treasure hunting journey once a party membership threshold is reached so that the explorers can present this charter credential to the Gatekeeper and gain entrance into Abydos.</p>



<p>To do this the WiseMan issues the JourneyCharter credential to each Explorer going on the journey indicated in the TreasureHuntingJourney credential. The JourneyCharter points to both the JourneyMark and the TreasureHuntingJourney credential.</p>


 
 


 5 – JourneyCharter presentation flow 



<p>As an Abydos Gatekeeper I want to allow authorized Explorers into Abydos so that they can have a good time on a treasure hunting journey.</p>



<p>To do this the Explorers present the JourneyCharter credential to Zaqiel the Gatekeeper, Zaqiel then validates the credential, and makes an access control decision on whether to allow an Explorer in to Abydos.</p>


 
 


 Credential Map 



<p>You decided to represent the secure proofs as four data containers (ACDC), or verifiable credentials (VC), with links between the different credentials as shown below. This graph shows the credentials and their links to each other, or edges. Each edge is named, as you will see later on in the schema map JSON file.</p>



 ATHENA Credential Graph 


 
 


 
 (1) <a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/athena/schemas/treasure-hunting-journey.json">TreasureHuntingJourney</a>: One for the Wise Man to describe the overall treasure hunting experience from start to end, treasure splits for hunting party members, the destination, and the like. This will be issued by the Wise Man to each potential explorer. 



 (2) <a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/athena/schemas/journey-mark-request.json">JourneyMarkRequest</a>: One for a potential explorer to request to join the treasure hunting journey. This will be issued to the Wise Man by an explorer. 



 (3) <a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/athena/schemas/journey-mark.json">JourneyMark</a>: One for the Wise man to issue to the accepted explorers so the Gatekeeper can know who the Wise Man has authorized for the journey. 



 (4) <a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/athena/schemas/journey-charter.json">JourneyCharter</a>: One that the explorer party can use to prove they are authorized for their journey to all who care to know as well as for the Gatekeeper to verify that they were authorized as a party. 
 



<p>In order to understand the credential schemas we must first cover some background knowledge on why schemas in ACDC are constructed the way they are, the purpose they serve, and how to use them.</p>



 ACDC Schema Writing 



<p><a href="https://json-schema.org/specification.html">JSON Schema</a> is the schema language ACDC schemas are expressed in. Beyond this schema language  <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ssmith-said-02.html#section-2.4-8">self addressing data</a> and <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ssmith-said-02.html#abstract">self addressing identifiers</a> are the mechanism used to verify schemas. With security first as a design principle self addressing data combines well with JSON schema to provide a secure schema capability for the KERI and ACDC ecosystem.</p>



 ACDC Credential Schemas with JSON Schema 



<p>For each ACDC we use there must be a schema defining the shape of the data in the container or credential. This schema must be verifiable and protected from schema revocation and schema malleability attacks. Using self addressing data (SAD) through the use of self addressing identifiers (SAIDs) makes it easy to accomplish both of these security objectives along with the business process objective of having a verifiable shape or envelope for our data.</p>



 What does an ACDC look like? 



 TreasureHuntingjourney credential issuance example JSON export 



<p>This is getting a little bit ahead of ourselves though a visual of what a credential looks like will help you understand where we are going. Take a quick look at what an issued JourneyMarkRequest looks like, how to get it, and then move on to the next section.</p>



 <code>{
  "v": "ACDC10JSON0001d9_",
  "d": "EEXZuecxP4Y3xZxvA_DtnrPX8nbSDPeGaMIxNKvLVENb",
  "i": "EIaJ5gpHSL9nl1XIWDkfMth1uxbD-AfLkqdiZL6S7HkZ",
  "ri": "EF3hGwYMK0r74qlSRbKw3_RzCrJ8D2Xmv5BlunrN3NC2",
  "s": "EIxAox3KEhiQ_yCwXWeriQ3ruPWbgK94NDDkHAZCuP9l",
  "a": {
    "d": "EPZSit7DYobEAv3WkVk2GBoBWrdglaHImi3_lnoc5fNl",
    "i": "EJS0-vv_OPAQCdJLmkd5dT0EW-mOfhn_Cje4yzRjTv8q",
    "dt": "2023-03-21T15:39:14.560430+00:00",
    "destination": "Osireion",
    "treasureSplit": "50/50",
    "partyThreshold": 2,
    "journeyEndorser": "Ramiel"
  }
}</code> 



<p>This JSON export of a credential is obtained with the KLI command <code>kli vc export</code> as shown below:</p>



 <code>RICHARD_CRED_SAID=$(kli vc list --name explorer --alias richard --said --schema EIxAox3KEhiQ_yCwXWeriQ3ruPWbgK94NDDkHAZCuP9l)
kli vc export --name explorer --alias richard --said $RICHARD_CRED_SAID</code> 



<p>This particular execution of the command assumes there is only one credential to be listed by the <code>kli vc list</code> command for the schema <code>EIxAox3KEhiQ_yCwXWeriQ3ruPWbgK94NDDkHAZCuP9l</code>, the schema identifier for the TreasureHuntingJourney schema. If there were multiple TreasureHuntingJourney credentials then there would be multiple SAIDs output by that command then you would pick one of them to be the argument to the <code>--said</code> parameter in order to export it’s JSON.</p>



 What is an ACDC schema made of? 



 TreasureHuntingjourney schema creation 



<p>The first schema to write is the JSON Schema for the <a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/athena/schemas/treasure-hunting-journey.json">TreasureHuntingJourney</a> credential that Richard and Elayne must receive from the Wise Man Ramiel in order to submit their treasure hunting request as a JourneyMarkRequest later. In order to write this schema we must first understand all of the elements that go into an ACDC schema.</p>



 Schema Parts 



<p>Each ACDC schema has five main parts:</p>



 
 Schema metadata (required) 



 Properties section (required) 



 Attributes section (required) 



 Edges section (if used) 



 Rules section (if used) 
 



<p>This is a collapsed view of the <a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/athena/schemas/treasure-hunting-journey.json">TreasureHuntingJourney schema</a>.</p>


 
 


<p>As you can see it has metadata, properties, attributes, and rules yet no edges. This is because this TreasureHuntingJourney ACDC does not extend nor connect with any other ACDC. This ACDC could appear as an edge in another ACDC though it does not have any edges itself.</p>



<p>Keep in mind that this instance of the TreasureHuntingJourney schema does not have any “$id” properties filled out yet. This tells you we are still writing the schema and are working from the template that will have the SAIDs added to, or “SAIDified.” We will do that step later after we finish writing the schema itself.</p>



<p>First we shall explain the attributes of the schema from outer to inner, top to bottom. Each of the attributes has a specific purpose we get into below.</p>



 SCHEMA description – top-layer 



<p>While ACDC schemas use the JSON Schema <a href="https://json-schema.org/specification.html">specification</a> in most regards the repurposing of the “$id” field is a notable exception. The top-most $id, $schema, title, description, type, credentialType, and version properties are about the ACDC schema itself. What is contained inside of the ACDC is described by what comes in the properties section which is further clarified by the additionalProperties and required attributes.</p>



 
 $id : The self addressing identifier (SAID) of the overall schema. This can only be computed when all of the dependent SAIDs for all attribute (e), edge (e), and rule (r) blocks have been computed and embedded within the respective $id attributes of each block. <br>This field is repurposed to provide a unique identifier of the schema instance. This is because in ACDCs all schemas are self addressing and so there is no separate document to retrieve such as in the non-ACDC usage of the $id field where the field contains a base URI fragment. Since the schema is keyed and stored by SAID rather than a Retrieval URI then there is little to no benefit from storing a retrieval URI in the $id section.<br>See the <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/draft-ssmith-acdc.html#name-schema-id-field-label">$id section</a> of the ACDC specification for a more complete explanation.
 
 Example Value: EDiuqE2fD2MhrSpZhAzlZn8XLSJiHt1pyy1eEWB-l1qq 
 
 



 $schema: This is typically set to the value of “<a href="http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#">http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#</a>“. The valid values can be found in the <a href="https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/schema.html">$schema</a> documentation of the JSON Schema specification. 



 title: a short descriptive name you as the schema designer can write. Can have spaces and punctuation 



 description: A longer explanation of the type of credential, what it is used for, or any other useful credential-related information. 



 type: A JSON schema field that can be an object, array, numeric type, boolean, string, or other accepted value according to the <a href="https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/index.html">JSON Schema Reference</a>. 



 credentialType: A field you can use to specify the specific type name of a credential. This is like a class name in an object oriented language and can be PascalCase with no spaces following typical object naming rules in many data languages and programming languages. 



 version: A version field for this specific credential type. This manages semantic version for the credential type you are using. This is a field you can use for schema versioning and migration. 
 
 This is distinct from the “v” version field described in the <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/draft-ssmith-acdc.html#name-version-string-field">Version String Field</a> section of the ACDC specification. This “version” field is the schema version. The ACDC “v” field specifies the serialization format version and the size of the serialized data type.  



 Keep in mind these two fields are separate and are used for different purposes even though they have a similar name.  



 Remembering that the short name occurs only in ACDC instances and that the long name occurs only in ACDC schemas is a good way to keep the concepts distinct in your mind. 
 
 



 properties: This is the section where you define the data attributes that will exist in a minted ACDC as seen above. The values for the properties in this section are provided during issuance with the data argument in <code>kli vc issue --data</code>.  



 additionalProperties: This is used to control handling of extra attributes not defined in the “properties” section. Can be “false” or a rule like <code>{ "type": "string" }</code> that constrains what additional properties can be added to a schema.<br>See the <a href="https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/object.html#additionalproperties">additionalProperties section</a> of JSON Schema. 



 required: Defines the list of properties that must appear in the “properties” section. By default the properties in the “properties” section are not required. See the “<a href="https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/object.html#required-properties">Required Properties</a>” part of the JSON Schema specification. 
 



<p>With all of the metadata properties covered we next describe the properties section of the TreasureHuntingJourney credential where you describe the fields of your custom data that will be a part of the credential.</p>



 TreasureHuntingJourney Properties 



<p>Only a small amount of data is written inside of a TreasureHuntingJourney credential:</p>



 <code>{
  "destination": "Osireion",
  "treasureSplit": "50/50",
  "partyThreshold": 2,
  "journeyEndorser": "Ramiel"
}</code> 



<p>The TreasureHuntingJourney credential is intended to provide information to prospective explorers about a journey they could embark on. This includes where the journey is headed, the destination, the proportion of treasure proceeds split amongst each journey party member, the minimum party threshold for the journey to be chartered, as well as the individual who chartered the journey.</p>



<p>The properties section of an ACDC schema is the location to include custom business-process data as shown above for the TreasureHuntingJourney credential.</p>



 Writing The Properties schema 



<p>Writing a schema to describe this small set of data requires a rather verbose description using JSON schema and though tedious is simple to understand once you get the hang of it.</p>



<p>In addition to this data there is a rules section “r” we will get into later when we talk about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricardian_contract">Ricardian Contracts</a> though for now we focus only on the data going into the credential, the “a” section.</p>



<p>Writing a properties section with JSON Schema to describe this requires both metadata and an attributes section.</p>


 
 


<p>The ACDC constraints written in KERI requires the presence of a number of metadata attributes in the properties section as shown below. Each attribute is linked to the appropriate section in the ACDC specification. The overall field map description is provided here: <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/draft-ssmith-acdc.html#name-top-level-fields">Top-Level Fields</a>.</p>



 
 <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/draft-ssmith-acdc.html#name-version-string-field">v</a> – “Version”: This describes the version of the serialization format and size used to write the schema. 



 <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/draft-ssmith-acdc.html#name-said-self-addressing-identi">d</a> – “SAID or identifier”: This provides a stable, universal, cryptographically verifiable and agile reference to the properties block. 



 <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/draft-ssmith-acdc.html#name-uuid-universally-unique-ide">u</a> – “Universally Unique Identifier as a Nonce”: A salty nonce used to provide cryptographic security to the “d” field to protect against brute force attacks such as rainbow table attacks to guess the block’s contents. This field is optional. 



 <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/draft-ssmith-acdc.html#name-aid-autonomic-identifier-an">i</a> – “Autonomic Identifier”: The identifier of the issuer of this ACDC. 



 <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/draft-ssmith-acdc.html#name-aid-autonomic-identifier-an">ri</a> – “Registry Identifier (Derived Identifier)”: The registry is the credential registry that this particular ACDC was issued from. This is derived from the “i” field for the issuer who issued the ACDC. A controller can create and use one or more registries. 



 <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/draft-ssmith-acdc.html#name-top-level-fields">s</a> – “Schema SAID”: The SAID of the schema to be used to validate this properties block. 



 <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/draft-ssmith-acdc.html#name-attribute-section">a</a> – “Attribute map”: The list of attributes that defines this schema. This is where the JSON data from above gets placed into the credential. 



 <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/draft-ssmith-acdc.html#name-rule-section">r</a> – “Rules section”: This is where any Ricardian Contracts (code as law) are stored in the credential. 
 



<p>Other than the metadata attributes the “a” and “r” properties, attributes and rules, are the more interesting parts. The “a” section is where you will describe the data properties that will be placed in your ACDC.</p>



 TreasureHuntingJourney Attributes Section  



<p>The attributes section can be one of two things as shown in the JSON schema, either a SAID or an inner block with its own properties.</p>



 <code>...
"a": 
  "oneOf": [
    {
      "description": "Attributes block SAID",
      "type": "string"
    },
    {
      "$id": "EPfNU6jej4GGyprpakq6KCO9os9vp9jLIRcH1xJqVezj",
      "description": "Attributes block",
      "type": "object",
      "properties": { 
...</code> 



 oneOf Operator and compact ACDC 



<p>The oneOf operator in JSON Schema means that the “a” section can be one of either of these two things. For ACDCs this means that the “a” block can be either the condensed version, which is the SAID of the “a” block, or it can be the entire contents of the “a” block. The condensed version is called a “<a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/draft-ssmith-acdc.html#name-compact-acdc">Compact ACDC</a>” and can be seen as equivalent to the un-condensed, or un-compacted version of the ACDC. </p>



<p>We are not covering compact ACDCs in this article so we move on to the full or un-compacted ACDC. </p>



 Full or un-compacted ACDC 



<p>The full ACDC schema includes another set of metadata attributes, and identifier field “$id”, and another properties section. JSON Schema as you can see is very verbose. Looking a level deeper we see the following set of attributes inside the “a” block:</p>


 
 


<p>Now this is starting to look like the JSON data we intend to put in the credential. Inside of the “a” block we see another “$id” field as well as other metadata fields from JSON Schema including the “description”, “type”, and “properties” fields. As those are mostly self explanatory we move on to the inner “properties” block.</p>



<p>Each property has a name, a description, and a type:</p>



 <code>...
"properties": {
  "d": {
    "description": "Attributes block SAID",
    "type": "string"
  },
...</code> 



<p>The “type” field must be one of the valid types from the list in <a href="https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/type.html#type-specific-keywords">JSON Schema</a>:</p>



 
 <a href="https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/string.html#string">string</a> 



 <a href="https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/numeric.html#number">number</a> 



 <a href="https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/numeric.html#integer">integer</a> 



 <a href="https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/object.html#object">object</a> 



 <a href="https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/array.html#array">array</a> 



 <a href="https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/boolean.html#boolean">boolean</a> 



 <a href="https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/null.html#null">null</a> 
 



<p>The “description” field is a schema-writer field to put a human-readable, concise definition of what the field contains.</p>



 Inner Properties block metadata fields 



<p>The inner properties block has a set of metadata fields that the ACDC code in KERI fills out for you including the “d” (SAID), “i” (issuee), and “dt” (date and time stamp) fields. They are required attributes in the top level of the inner properties block and look like the following in the JSON schemas where they appear:</p>



 ...
"properties": {
  "d": {
    "description": "Attributes block SAID",
    "type": "string"
  },
  "i": {
    "description": "Issuee AID",
    "type": "string"
  },
  "dt": {
    "description": "Issuance date time",
    "type": "string",
    "format": "date-time"
  },
... 



<p>The $id field is a SAID of the “a” attributes block. This provides the “a” block with cryptographic protection and verifiability when signed by a KERI key.</p>



 Inner Properties Block Custom Fields 



<p>Following the required properties you define your own custom properties to be added to the ACDC. In the case of the TreasureHuntingJourney credential those properties include the “destination”, “treasureSplit”, “partyThreshold”, and “journeyEndorser” fields as follows:</p>



 ...
"properties": {
  ...
  "destination": {
    "description": "The target location for this journey where the hunters will go.",
    "type": "string"
  },
  "treasureSplit": {
    "description": "The type of splits for this journey. 50/50, 25/25/25/25, and so forth. Must add up to 100.",
    "type": "string"
  },
  "partyThreshold": {
    "description": "The minimum party member threshold needed to charter this journey",
    "type": "integer"
  },
  "journeyEndorser": {
    "description": "The AID of the ATHENA inner circle member endorsing this treasure hunting journey.",
    "type": "string"
  }
... 



<p>Each field has a description and a type. The validation of each field is up to the issuer or the verifier of the credential.</p>



 The Edge Section 



<p>We will briefly cover the JourneyMarkRequest schema since we have not covered edge sections yet. The TreasureHuntingJourney credential has no edges so it isn’t a good example of a credential with an edge section.</p>



 JourneyMarkRequest Schema 



<p>As you can see the JourneyMarkRequest has an additional attribute, the “e” section. This is for edges, or chains between individual ACDCs.</p>


 
 


<p>The edge section is very similar to an “attributes” section except it is specialized. It contains a “oneOf” operator similar to the “attributes” section since the edge section may also be represented by a SAID in the most compact version, or any compact version, of an ACDC.</p>


 
 


<p>Inside of the Edges block, the second item in this “oneOf” array, we see a set of common properties. $id, description, and type are what we have seen before, as is properties. Inside the properties block we find something slightly different.</p>


 
 


<p>The “d” field is the SAID of this particular edges block and is computed from the other properties which in this case is just the “journey” property.</p>



<p>The “journey” property is the actual edge that points to the TreasureHuntingJourney credential (not the TreasureHintingJourney – typo).</p>



<p>The “n” field is the SAID of the far side credential, the TreasureHuntingJourney.</p>



<p>The “s” field is the SAID of the ACDC schema for the TreasureHuntingJourney.</p>



<p>Defining an edge section like this in a schema is the foundation of what is needed to add in an edge between these two credentials later during the credential issuance process.</p>



 The Other Schemas 



<p>With this nearly exhaustive explanation of one of the four schemas complete and a small amount on the JourneyMarkREquest edge we will leave the writing or reading of the other three of the four schemas up to the reader. This includes the JourneyMarkRequest, JourneyMark, and JourneyCharter. You may find the ATHENA version of the other schemas in the <code>athena<a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/tree/master/athena/schemas">/schemas</a></code> directory. They will be described briefly below at a high level. You can apply the schema writing concepts from above to all of the other schemas.</p>



<p>Just glance over the following pictures to get a sense of what is in each schema and them move on to the credential linking section afterwards. </p>



 JourneyMark Schema 



<p>Has the following properties:</p>


 
 


<p>And edge properties for “request”</p>


 
 


 JourneyCharter Schema 



<p>Has the following properties:</p>


 
 


<p>And the following edges. Something different for the JourneyCharter schema is that it links to two edges, both “mark” and “journey”:</p>


 
 


 Linking Schemas 



<p>One concept we have not yet covered is how to link schemas together. We cover this next in the Schema Linking and Verification section via the use of the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/kaslcred/">KASLCred utility</a>.</p>



 Schema Linking and Verification 



<p>Linking schemas with <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/draft-ssmith-acdc.html#section-2.4">self addressing data</a> is part of the way ACDCs provide security, specifically end-verifiability, of credentials. For data to be self addressing it must contain an identifier that is computed from the contents of the data, a digest. Self addressing data protects against security exploits like schema malleability and schema revocation attacks while also being an easy way to verify the contents of the data. These self addressing identifiers are placed in the “<a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/draft-ssmith-acdc.html#name-said-self-addressing-identi">$id</a>” attributes of the various blocks in ACDC schemas.</p>



<p>Here is an example self addressing identifier for the TreasureHuntingJourney ACDC shown above: <code>EEXZuecxP4Y3xZxvA_DtnrPX8nbSDPeGaMIxNKvLVENb</code></p>



 Self Addressing Data (SAD) and Self Addressing Identifiers (SAIDs) 



<p>The self addressing identifier (SAID) is like a key in a key-value pair and the data is like the value except that the identifier computation algorithm allows for the SAID to be embedded in the data. This requires a two pass process, one to calculate the identifier, and the second to embed it within the data. Verifying self addressing data also requires a two-pass verification function, one pass to remove the embedded identifier, and the second to verify the data against the SAID. To fully understand the self addressing identifier concept refer to the <a href="https://weboftrust.github.io/ietf-said/draft-ssmith-said.html">IETF Draft Specification for Self-Addressing IDentifier (SAID)</a> by Samuel smith. </p>



 Schema Evaluation to compute SAIDs 



<p>Using self addressing identifiers (SAIDs) with a graph of schemas means that the credential schemas must be evaluated in a deterministic order and have their “$id” properties populated from the inner-most or top-most schema to the outer-most or bottom-most schema. In this sense the outer-most schema points to the innermost schema and the bottom-most schema points to the top-most schema as in the ATHENA Credential Graph diagram above and reproduced below for reference. This proper order requires computing a dependency graph of the schemas based on their edges (dependencies) in order to facilitate generating identifiers on the inner-most (or top-most) schemas and then each layer outward to the outermost (or bottom-most) schemas. </p>


 
 


 Graph Evaluation Order 



<p>In our case our graph must be generated in the following order:</p>



 
 TreasureHuntingJourney (root node, no dependents) 



 JourneyMarkRequest (dependent on TreasureHuntingJourney) 



 JourneyMark (dependent on JourneyMarkRequest) 



 JourneyCharter (dependent on both JourneyMark and TreasureHuntingJourney) 
 



<p>Your options here are to either do this by hand with the <code>kli saidify</code> command and manually editing all of the schema files or you can use the code in the <code><a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/vLEI/blob/dev/src/vlei/generate.py">generate.py</a></code> file from the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/vLEI">WebOfTrust/vLEI</a> repository as a guide. Alternatively you could use the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/kaslcred/">KASLCred</a> Python package to do all of the linking for you. For this post we will use KASLCred in the interest of time.</p>



 KASLCred 



<p>While the intricacies of parsing ACDC schemas and adding SAIDs in the “$id” attributes are interesting, also called “saidifying” the schemas, in the interest of time we will use the KASLCred utility written to do all the saidifying for you. You can go read the Python code of the <a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/kaslcred">TetraVeda/kaslcred</a> repository if you want to see how it was done. It’s only a few hundred lines of code.</p>



 KASLCred Schema Map 



<p>Using KASLCred to evaluate your schema graph involves writing a schema map file expressing the set of credentials to be evaluated in a JSON file. The “athena/schemas/athena-schema-map.json” file from the tutorial repository is reproduced below for reference:</p>



 <code>{
  "schemas": [
    {
      "schemaName": "JourneyCharter",
      "schemaFilePath": "journey-charter.json",
      "dependencies": ["JourneyMark", "TreasureHuntingJourney"],
      "edgeName": ""
    },
    {
      "schemaName": "JourneyMarkRequest",
      "schemaFilePath": "journey-mark-request.json",
      "dependencies": ["TreasureHuntingJourney"],
      "edgeName": "request"
    },
    {
      "schemaName": "TreasureHuntingJourney",
      "schemaFilePath": "treasure-hunting-journey.json",
      "dependencies": [],
      "edgeName": "journey"
    },
    {
      "schemaName": "JourneyMark",
      "schemaFilePath": "journey-mark.json",
      "dependencies": ["JourneyMarkRequest"],
      "edgeName": "mark"
    }
  ]
}</code> 



 Evaluation Order 



<p>As you can see this list of schemas is out of order. The first item in the list, JourneyCharter, should be evaluated last. And the third item in the list, TreasureHuntingJourney, should be evaluated first. This is no problem for KASLCred as it reads the dependencies array and reorders the schemas to be evaluated in the order where the least dependent item (with no dependencies) is evaluated first and then the next most dependent item is evaluated after all of its dependencies is evaluated and so forth for all dependencies.</p>



<p>Using KASLCred is as simple as a Pip Install and a <code>python -m</code> invocation once you have Libsodium and KERI installed:</p>



 <code># Install KERI and Libsodium as noted in the installation instructions above
pip install kaslcred==0.0.8

# Set ABYDOS_REPO_DIR to where you cloned the abydos-tutorial repo.
# Usage: python -m kaslcred [schemas dir] [results dir] [schema map file]
python -m kaslcred \
  ${ABYDOS_REPO_DIR}/athena/schemas \
  ${ABYDOS_REPO_DIR}/athena/saidified_schemas \
  ${ABYDOS_REPO_DIR}/athena/schemas/athena-schema-map.json</code> 



<p>As long as all of the file names in the <code>schemaFilePath</code> properties in the schema map JSON file exist then you will end up with a set of SAIDified schemas ready to use.</p>



 Quick overview of the other schemas 



<p>Review the JSON contents of the abydos-tutorial/athena/credential_data directory to get a sense for what kind of business process we are building on top of these schemas. We reproduce them here to illustrate their purpose.</p>



 JourneyMarkRequest data – for Richard 



 <code>{
  "requester": {
    "firstName": "Richard",
    "lastName": "Ayris",
    "nickname": "Dunkie"
  },
  "desiredPartySize": 2,
  "desiredSplit": 50.00
}</code> 



<p>As you can see here this credential looks a lot like an account registration HTTP REST API request. You can really do anything with ACDC credentials. It also indicates preferences to the ATHENA explorer matchmaking engine with the desired party size and the desired split.</p>



 JourneyMark data – for Richard 



 <code>{
  "journeyDestination": "Osireion",
  "gatekeeper": "Zaqiel",
  "negotiatedSplit": 50.00
}</code> 



<p>This data indicates where Richard will be going and other details of the journey. Remember that the JourneyMark has a graph edge pointing to the JourneyMarkRequest which means credential consumers can also resolve data from both the JourneyMarkRequest and the TreasureHuntingJourney credentials through those links.</p>



 JourneyCharter data – for Richard 



 <code>{
  "partySize": 2,
  "authorizerName": "Ramiel"
}</code> 



<p>As the final data packet sent as an ACDC this credential indicates what each explorer stands to expect on the chartered journey such as how many members they will be traveling with and who officially blessed their journey.</p>



 Schemas Review 



<p>Now that we have written the needed schemas for ATHENA and have SAIDified them with KASLCred we are ready to use them in configuring our trust network components as well as to issue and verify credentials. </p>



<p>Next we configure our trust network to cache these schemas with the vLEI caching server implementation (vLEI-server). </p>



 Network Configuration 



<p>Configuring a KERI network involves setting up the following components:</p>



 
 ACDC Schema Caching 



 Witnesses 



 Controllers 



 Agents (if you are using them) 



 Performing Out Of Band Introductions (OOBIs) between controllers and objects 
 



<p>Our setup will involve the following additional components</p>



 
 A customized controller used for the Abydos Gatekeeper to decide whether or not explorers can be permitted to enter Abydos. It will be configured to trust one issuer, the Wise Man, that will be used to check the issuance of the JourneyCharter credentials against. 



 A webhook the customized controller communicates with to tie credential presentation and revocation events into a custom business logic layer. 
 



<p>Here is the network component diagram again for reference:</p>


 
 


<p>Schema caching is first item to be set up as all of the controllers depend on it. You could set up witnesses first as well. It is up to you.</p>



 Schema Caching 



<p>In order to successfully receive, validate, and handle an ACDC each KERI controller using that ACDC must be able to resolve and load the schema for that ACDC. The schemas are resolved based on the SAID of the schema using an out of band introduction (OOBI) that indicates the location the schema is stored at and can be retrieved from. The controller may either be configured with the location of this schema on startup in the controller bootstrap JSON configuration file or be configured at runtime through usage of the OOBI resolution mechanism.</p>



 vLEI-server 


 
 


<p> The vLEI-server provides a convenient implementation of a simple caching server that meets our needs. All the vLEI caching server (vLEI-server) does is make the schemas available as JSON objects as responses to HTTP requests. It could very easily be rewritten in your favorite language if you wanted a fun, easy challenge. (Hint, write it in Rust, the KERI community will be happy with you.)</p>



<p>Once you have the vLEI repository cloned and the vLEI-server installed as described in the installation instructions above you can run the vLEI-server with a command similar to the following:</p>



 <code># Change directories to the abydos-tutorial repository directory.
# Set ATHENA_DIR to be your abydos-tutorial/athena directory.
vLEI-server \
  -s "${ATHENA_DIR}"/saidified_schemas \
  -c "${ATHENA_DIR}"/cache/acdc \
  -o "${ATHENA_DIR}"/cache/oobis</code> 



<p>This will give you output similar to the following:</p>



 <code>caching schema EIxAox3KEhiQ_yCwXWeriQ3ruPWbgK94NDDkHAZCuP9l
caching schema ELc8tMg_hhsAPfVbjUBBC-giEy5440oSb9EzFBZdAxHD
caching schema EBEefH4LNQswHSrXanb-3GbjCZK7I_UCL6BdD-zwJ4my
caching schema EEq0AkHV-i5-aCc1JMBGsd7G85HlBzI3BfyuS5lHOGjr</code> 



<p>If you have anything in the <code>cache/acdc</code> or <code>cache/oobis</code> directories then those will be shown in the log output as well.</p>



<p>With the ACDC schemas successfully being cached the next step is to deploy the witness network which requires writing witness configuration files.</p>



 Witness Network 



<p>Our witness network consists of three of the witnesses used in the KERI Demonstration Witness network meaning we use the same cryptographic key salts, keystore names, and alias names.</p>



<p>This means we need a configuration file for each of the witnesses. The document symbols you see on the preceding diagram show the filenames for each of the witnesses represented by a gray circle.</p>



<p>To set up the witness network we must do the following things:</p>



 
 Write witness configuration files ensuring the witnesses listen for incoming traffic on a set of TCP and HTTP ports. 



 Create the keystores for the witnesses using the KERI command line interface, the KLI, via <code>kli init</code> subcommand. 



 Start witnesses using the KLI via the <code>keri witness start</code> subcommand. 
 



<p>For the ATHENA witness network we create three separate witnesses as shown above on the following ports:</p>



 
 <code>wan</code>: TCP 5632 HTTP 5642 



 <code>wes</code>: TCP 5633 HTTP 5643 



 <code>wil</code>: TCP 5634 HTTP 5644 
 



 Building your own, non-demo witnesses and agents 



<p>In order for you to really understand the KERI KLI we do not want you to have to rely on any demo commands such as <code>kli witness demo</code> or <code>kli agent vlei</code> so we show you here how to use the keystore and witness commands directly.</p>



<p>First we address the writing of witness configuration files.</p>



 Witness Configuration files 



<p>Each witness on startup reads a witness configuration file. This file includes properties such as TCP and HTTP ports to listen on and any OOBIs to resolve at startup. See below for a witness configuration file example. The diagram shows the specific witness configuration file used for each specific witness.</p>


 
 


 Location and Directory Structure 



<p>JSON configuration files for KERI witnesses must be placed inside a particular directory structure. This directory structure is as follows<br><code>CONFIG_ROOT/keri/cf/main</code></p>


 
 


<p>The reason for this is that the KERI <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy/blob/446eca9a694166e24416221ec49736cb071cd790/src/keri/app/configing.py#L29">Configer module</a> uses the root path of “keri/cf” and the sub path of “main” as see in the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy/blob/446eca9a694166e24416221ec49736cb071cd790/src/keri/app/configing.py#L50">Configer.__init__</a> function. You can configure the CONFIG_ROOT directory path by customizing the <code>--config-dir</code> property though the <code>keri/cf/main</code> directory path will be created for you inside of the CONFIG_ROOT directory if they do not already exist.</p>



<p>Then, inside this <code>CONFIG_ROOT/keri/cf/main</code> directory you must place your witness configuration JSON files.</p>



 Witness Configuration File Contents 



<p>The contents of a witness configuration file look as follows:</p>



 <code>{
  "wan": {
    "dt": "2022-01-20T12:57:59.823350+00:00",
    "curls": ["tcp://127.0.0.1:5632/", "http://127.0.0.1:5642/"]
  },
  "dt": "2022-01-20T12:57:59.823350+00:00",
  "iurls": [
  ]
}</code> 



<p>There must be a key in the configuration object named the same as the value passed into the <code>--alias [alias]</code> property for the subsequent <code>kli witness start</code> command. This applies to KERIpy, the Python implementation of KERI and the reference implementation of the KERI and ACDC specification. </p>



<p>Refer specifically to KERIpy <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy/blob/446eca9a694166e24416221ec49736cb071cd790/src/keri/app/habbing.py#L971">habbing.pyL971</a> in the <code>reconfigure</code> function to see how the configuration file must have an appropriately named key. Keep in mind that this function documentation states that “Config file is meant to be read only at init not changed by app at run time” so you should make any changes to this configuration before the <code>kli witness start</code> commands are run since any changes during run time will not be recognized until the witness is stopped and then started again.</p>



<p>The values inside the configuration file are as follows. Sub-properties such as the “dt” property inside of “wan” are indicated with the dot notation.</p>



 
 “wan”: The named configuration block property for a given witness.
 
 “wan.dt”: The date-time stamp when the configuration was created. 



 “wan.curls”: Controller URLs. This is the list of URLs that indicate the protocol and ports for the witness to listen on. You can see both TCP port 5632 and HTTP port 5642 in the above example. 
 
 



 “dt”: The date and timestamp the configuration was created 



 “iurls”: Introduction URLs. This means any out of band introduction (OOBI) URLs to process and resolve on startup. 
 



<p>Other properties that are not shown above yet can be presented include:</p>



 
 “durls”: Data URLs. Another section for OOBI URLs to process. Typically you put credential OOBIs in this section you want the witness, really just a KERI controller, to resolve on startup. You could put these URLs in the “iurls” section as well. 



 “wurls”: Well-known OOBIs to resolve on startup. 
 



<p>With this explanation of how to write a witness configuration file you now can go make the other two witness configuration files for “wil” and “wes,” or you can pull them from the tutorial repo: <a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/tree/master/athena/conf/keri/cf/main">athena/conf/keri/cf/main/*.json</a></p>



 Witness Create Command: kli init 



<p>Next we must create the keystores. We will end up with the following three keystores:</p>


 
 


<p>We use the <code>kli init</code> command to create each of the keystores.</p>



<p>A witness requires a keystore to be created first in order to start the witness later. Do this with a command like the following:</p>



 <code>kli init --name wan --salt 0AB3YW5uLXRoZS13aXRuZXNz --nopasscode \
    --config-dir "${CONFIG_DIR}" \
    --config-file main/wan-witness</code> 



<p>You can see you must name the witness and pass in a configuration directory and file. The configuration file must have the “main/” path prefix on it since the underlying <code>Configer</code> class defaults the “base” path property to be “main” as seen on <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy/blob/446eca9a694166e24416221ec49736cb071cd790/src/keri/app/configing.py#L50">Configer:L50 here</a>. You don’t need to add the “.json” suffix since KERIpy will do that for you. The filename alone is sufficient.</p>



<p>Running this command will create output similar to the following:</p>



 <code>KERI Keystore created at: /Users/myuser/.keri/ks/wan
KERI Database created at: /Users/myuser/.keri/db/wan
KERI Credential Store created at: /Users/myuser/.keri/reg/wan</code> 



 Keystore Passcodes 



<p>Here I am not using any passcodes though you are free to modify the example to use them. The passcode is an additional layer of security used to unlock a keystore. Using a passcode would look like adding in a passcode argument like so: <code>--passcode DoB26Fj4x9LboAFWJra17O</code></p>



 For Each Witness 



<p>Write a configuration file for each of the three witnesses, wan, wil, and wes. You can use the <code>create_witnesses</code> function in the <code>workflow.sh</code> script as a guide. Place each of the JSON configuration files in your configuration directory with the appropriate directory suffix like so:<br><code>$CONFIG_DIR/keri/cf/main</code></p>



 Cryptographic Salts (seeds) 



<p>The salt used here is the same as both what is used in the Abydos Tutorial witness set as well as what is used for the demo command <code>kli witness demo</code> that starts six witnesses for you. Using the same salt means the keys generated from the salt will be the same. So you may conclude that protecting your salt is as important as protecting your keys themselves similar to protecting your Bitcoin or Ethereum seed phrase and private keys. </p>



<p>Whatever you do make sure your seeds do not get in the hands of people who shouldn’t have them and be sure to use highly secure deployment mechanisms to inject seeds into your witness, agent, and controller deployments.</p>



<p>Moving on, next we start the witness.</p>



 Witness Start Command: kli witness start 



<p>Starting a witness is very simple yet it does depend on code recently added to KERIpy to support the <code>--config-dir</code> and <code>--config-file</code> arguments so make sure you install the latest version of KERIpy from source with <code>python -m pip install -e ./</code> from the KERIpy repository root directory. This will give you at least KERIpy 1.0.0 release locally whether or not the release has been pushed to PyPi or GitHub yet.</p>



 <code>kli witness start --name wan --alias wan \
  -T ${WAN_WITNESS_TCP_PORT} \
  -H ${WAN_WITNESS_HTTP_PORT} \
  --config-dir "${CONFIG_DIR}" \
  --config-file wan-witness</code> 



<p>Ports and the alias name are a few additional configuration options here. Remember that the “alias” property must match the name used in the witness configuration file you wrote earlier in which you defined the TCP and HTTP endpoints for your witness to listen on. The other arguments are as they seem, -T for the TCP port and -H for the HTTP port the witness will listen on.</p>



<p>Run this command for each of the three witnesses wan, wil, and wes. You can use whatever ports you’d like though the ATHENA ports used are shown in the <a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/workflow.sh#L109">variables section</a> near the top of the <code>workflow.sh</code> script. </p>



<p>Running this command successfully will provide output similar to the following:</p>



 <code>Witness wan : BBilc4-L3tFUnfM_wJr4S4OJanAv_VmF_dJNN6vkf2Ha</code> 



<p>You can either do the commands by hand yourself or you can use the <code>workflow.sh</code> script to do it for you. It is recommended to get some practice yourself with the commands in order to learn them though you can start by reading the <code>start_witnesses</code> function in the <code>workflow.sh</code> script to see how the Abydos Tutorial starts the ATHENA witnesses. Be aware that BASH variables are used heavily throughout the script so you will need to refer often to the variables section at the top of the script in order to fully understand what each of the commands are doing.</p>



<p>Once you have all of the witnesses set up and started your next task is to set up the KERI controllers for Richard, Elayne, Ramiel, and Zaqiel. This involves writing a bootstrap configuration file which we get into next. </p>



 KERI Controller Setup 



<p>Creating and setting up controllers can happen in one of two ways, with the KERI command line, the KLI, or with the KERI Agent API (called the Mark I Agent, currently deprecated). The KLI method does not start a running process or daemon while the Agent runs as a daemon. An important note on the existing Agent API in KERIpy is that Agent API is now deprecated in favor  of the new Agent API being written as a separate deployable called <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keria">KERIA</a> (called the Mark II Agent). </p>



<p>While the existing Agent API is deprecated it is nonetheless useful to see how the KLI compares to using REST requests in the Agent API. You get an idea of how you might write your own API on top of a KERI controller or how you might contribute to the agent implementations. Once the Mark II Agent API is ready this article will be updated with the new API.</p>



<p>There are three general steps to setting up a controller:</p>



 
 Write the controller configuration file. 



 Initialize the controller’s keystore 



 Create the first keypair for the controller, called a prefix, by performing an inception event. This involves using an alias to label that particular prefix. 
 



<p>The KLI flow is shorter than the Agent flow though they both accomplish the same objective. You may follow along in the <code>workflow.sh</code> script with the code for setting up each of the four controllers in the following functions:</p>



 
 For the Agent flow <code>start_agents</code> starts up all needed agents. 



 <code>read_witness_prefixes_and_configure</code> updates the controller and agent bootstrap configuration files. 



 <code>make_keystores_and_incept_kli</code> and <code>make_keystores_and_incept_agent</code> perform the keystore creation and inception events using the KLI or Agent API, respectively. 
 



 Four Controllers 



<p>There are four controllers to be created, one each for Richard, Elayne, Ramiel, and Zaqiel. This involves writing configuration files with OOBIs for witnesses, and credential schemas, initializing controller keystores, performing the inception events, and, in the case of using agents, starting the KERI Agent for each controller. Below is a simplified diagram of the controllers and the out of OOBI connections that must be made between the controllers to support credential issuance and presentation.</p>


 
 


 Controller Bootstrap Configuration File 



<p>A bootstrap configuration file instructs a KERI controller what OOBI URLs to resolve on initial startup including both a list of controller OOBIs and a list of credential schema OOBIs. The list of controller OOBIs is usually a list of OOBIs for each witnesses that will be used to perform the inception event though it can be expanded to other controllers beyond the witness pool.</p>



<p>When first starting a controller it reads in the configuration file specified by the <code>--config-file</code> argument to either the <code>kli init</code> or <code>kli agent start</code> commands. Beware that the configuration file is not re-read on subsequent startups. If you need a controller to resolve more OOBIs after initial bootstrapping then use the <code>kli oobi resolve</code> command or equivalent Agent REST request.</p>



 Example Config 



<p>The example config file from the ATHENA network shows three controller OOBI URLs in “iurls” and four credential schema OOBI URLs in “durls”. Starting an agent also reads in a similar configuration file with OOBIs for the agent to resolve during initialization. Agents are covered in a later section.</p>



<p>Once you have all three prefixes for the witnesses you can make OOBIs and write them into configuration files for both KLI and Agent modes:</p>



 
 controller-oobi-bootstrap.json for the KLI mode
 
 Full path: abydos-tutorial/athena/conf/keri/cf/controller-oobi-bootstrap.json 
 
 



 agent-oobi-bootstrap.json for the Agent mode
 
 Full path: abydos-tutorial/athena/conf/keri/cf/agent-oobi-bootstrap.json 
 
 
 



<p>If you look into each of these two configuration files you will find their contents to be identical and will look very similar to the below:</p>



 <code>{
  "dt": "2022-01-20T12:57:59.823350+00:00",
  "iurls": [
    "http://127.0.0.1:5642/oobi/BBilc4-L3tFUnfM_wJr4S4OJanAv_VmF_dJNN6vkf2Ha",
    "http://127.0.0.1:5643/oobi/BLskRTInXnMxWaGqcpSyMgo0nYbalW99cGZESrz3zapM",
    "http://127.0.0.1:5644/oobi/BIKKuvBwpmDVA4Ds-EpL5bt9OqPzWPja2LigFYZN2YfX"
  ],
  "durls": [
    "http://127.0.0.1:7723/oobi/EIxAox3KEhiQ_yCwXWeriQ3ruPWbgK94NDDkHAZCuP9l",
    "http://127.0.0.1:7723/oobi/ELc8tMg_hhsAPfVbjUBBC-giEy5440oSb9EzFBZdAxHD",
    "http://127.0.0.1:7723/oobi/EBEefH4LNQswHSrXanb-3GbjCZK7I_UCL6BdD-zwJ4my",
    "http://127.0.0.1:7723/oobi/EEq0AkHV-i5-aCc1JMBGsd7G85HlBzI3BfyuS5lHOGjr"
  ]
}</code> 



<p>Next we learn how to write each of the two OOBI lists for both the “iurls” and the “durls” sections of the configuration files.</p>



 IURLS: Writing controller OOBIs for the “iurls” section 



<p>An OOBI URLs uses the following URL scheme:<br>“<code>[protocol]://[host]:[port]/oobi/[prefix]</code>“</p>



<p>The protocol is typically “http” though may be “tcp” as well. Host and port will be specific to your deployment. Creating a prefix involves many steps as shown in a later section. Without jumping ahead you can use the prefixes automatically created during the <code>kli witness start</code> command you ran earlier. This created a set of keystores which also created a set of prefixes for each witness. You can get the prefixes you created with the <code>kli status</code> command as shown below.</p>



 Prefixes with kli status 



<p>The prefix is the prefix of the first key in a sequence of KERI key creation events (establishment events). This is the same prefix that is added into the KERI DID generation function when you run <code>kli did generate</code>. To turn the prefix into a did you do as follows:<br><code>did:[prefix]</code><br>For example, using the first OOBI below, the corresponding DID would be:<br><code>did:keri:BBilc4-L3tFUnfM_wJr4S4OJanAv_VmF_dJNN6vkf2Ha</code></p>



<p>For now you can get the prefix with the <code>kli status command</code> as shown in the <code><a href="http://update_config_with_witness_oobis">read_witness_prefixes_and_configure</a></code> function in <code>workflow.sh</code>. Here is an example using <code>kli status</code> and AWK to store witness wan’s prefix in the <code>WAN_PREFIX</code> variable:</p>



 <code>WAN_PREFIX=$(kli status --name wan --alias wan | awk '/Identifier:/ {print $2}')

# Then do echo $WAN_PREFIX to see the value of the prefix
echo $WAN_PREFIX</code> 



<p>The <code><a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/workflow.sh#L352">update_config_with_witness_oobis</a></code> function does this for you in the <code>workflow.sh</code> script. Once you finish writing your witness OOBIs to the configuration file your “iurls” section should look like the following:</p>



 <code>{
  "dt": "2022-01-20T12:57:59.823350+00:00",
  "iurls": [
    "http://127.0.0.1:5642/oobi/BBilc4-L3tFUnfM_wJr4S4OJanAv_VmF_dJNN6vkf2Ha",
    "http://127.0.0.1:5643/oobi/BLskRTInXnMxWaGqcpSyMgo0nYbalW99cGZESrz3zapM",
    "http://127.0.0.1:5644/oobi/BIKKuvBwpmDVA4Ds-EpL5bt9OqPzWPja2LigFYZN2YfX"
  ],
  "durls": [
    ...
  ]
}</code> 



<p>Next we write the “durls” section for credential schema OOBIs. This enables controllers to recognize ACDC schemas by their SAID.</p>



 DURLS: WRITING credential schema OOBI URLs for the “durls” section 



<p>The four OOBIs in the “durls” are created by getting the “$id” properties from each of the schemas you created during the schema writing and linking step above with KASLCred. The scheme for data OOBIs is as follows:<br><code>[protocol]://[caching_server_host]:[caching_server_port]/oobi/[schema_said]</code></p>



<p>For example, “<code>EEq0AkHV-i5-aCc1JMBGsd7G85HlBzI3BfyuS5lHOGjr</code>” is the <code>[schema_said]</code> property for the OOBI url for the JourneyCharter OOBI URL. This. is pulled directly from the schema in <code>abydos-tutorial/athena/saidified_schemas/JourneyCharter__EEq0AkHV-i5-aCc1JMBGsd7G85HlBzI3BfyuS5lHOGjr.json</code></p>


 
 


<p>The resulting OOBI URL looks like the following:</p>



<p><code>"http://127.0.0.1:7723/oobi/EEq0AkHV-i5-aCc1JMBGsd7G85HlBzI3BfyuS5lHOGjr"</code></p>



<p>In this instance the caching server host and port correspond to the <code>vLEI-server</code> instance ATHENA defines in the <code>workflow.sh</code> script, or <code>http://127.0.0.1</code> and <code>7723</code>, respectively.</p>



<p>Once you have the OOBI URLs set up then write them into both the controller-oobi-bootstrap.json file and the “agent-oobi-bootstrap.json” files in the “$CONFIG_DIR/keri/cf” configuration directory. In the Abydos Tutorial the location “<code>abydos-tutorial/athena/conf/keri/cf</code>” is the $CONFIG_DIR configuration directory.</p>



<p>These files should look somewhat like the following once you are finished:</p>



 <code>{
  "dt": "2022-01-20T12:57:59.823350+00:00",
  "iurls": [
    "http://127.0.0.1:5642/oobi/BBilc4-L3tFUnfM_wJr4S4OJanAv_VmF_dJNN6vkf2Ha",
    "http://127.0.0.1:5643/oobi/BLskRTInXnMxWaGqcpSyMgo0nYbalW99cGZESrz3zapM",
    "http://127.0.0.1:5644/oobi/BIKKuvBwpmDVA4Ds-EpL5bt9OqPzWPja2LigFYZN2YfX"
  ],
  "durls": [
    "http://127.0.0.1:7723/oobi/EIxAox3KEhiQ_yCwXWeriQ3ruPWbgK94NDDkHAZCuP9l",
    "http://127.0.0.1:7723/oobi/ELc8tMg_hhsAPfVbjUBBC-giEy5440oSb9EzFBZdAxHD",
    "http://127.0.0.1:7723/oobi/EBEefH4LNQswHSrXanb-3GbjCZK7I_UCL6BdD-zwJ4my",
    "http://127.0.0.1:7723/oobi/EEq0AkHV-i5-aCc1JMBGsd7G85HlBzI3BfyuS5lHOGjr"
  ]
}</code> 



<p>Now that you have the controller and agent bootstrap configuration files set up we show how to start up agents with the KLI.</p>



 KERI Agents 



 KERI Agent Startup – Mark I agent (deprecated) 



<p>Creating and handling a controller with the KERI Mark I agent involves a four step process:</p>


 
 


 
 Start the agent with <code>kli agent start</code> 



 POST to /boot to initialize the keystore 



 PUT to /boot to unlock the keystore 



 POST to /ids/${ALIAS} to perform the inception event 
 



<p>There are four agents to be set up for the ATHENA network, one each for Richard, Elayne, Ramiel, and Zaqiel as shown below:</p>


 
 


 KERI Controller Agent Start (Mark I Agent – deprecated) 



<p>You will notice that the <code>--insecure</code> option is passed to the agent start command. This is because the first draft of a KERI Agent, the Mark I agent, has a partially complete HTTP signature signing scheme that currently does not function and thus must be disabled with the <code>--insecure</code> option. Without disabling this option you will not be able to communicate at all with a Mark I agent. The next version of KERI Agents is <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keria">KERIA</a>, the Mark II agent, and this has a fully complete HTTP signature signing scheme intended to work with <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/signify-ts">Signify</a>, a TypeScript edge signing library for KERI.</p>



<p>The <code>--path</code> option declares a directory to be served up at the <code>$AGENT_URL/static</code> HTTP endpoint though isn’t important for this tutorial. It was originally used to host Swagger API documentation for the Agent API.</p>



<p>All of the other configuration options are relatively straightforward.</p>



 
 <code>--config-dir</code> is the directory the agent bootstrap file will be located in
 
 Full path: abydos-tutorial/athena/conf/keri/cf 
 
 



 <code>--config-file</code> is the configuration file to be used
 
 agent-oobi-bootstrap.json for the Agent mode 



 Full path: abydos-tutorial/athena/conf/keri/cf/agent-oobi-bootstrap.json 
 
 



 <code>--tcp</code> is the TCP port to listen on 



 <code>--admin-http-port</code> is the HTTP port to listen on. This is the port we will be submitting all of our requests to. 
 



 <code>kli agent start --insecure \
  --admin-http-port ${EXPLORER_AGENT_HTTP_PORT} \
  --tcp ${EXPLORER_AGENT_TCP_PORT} \
  --config-dir ${CONFIG_DIR} \
  --config-file ${AGENT_CONFIG_FILENAME} \
  --path ${ATHENA_DIR}/agent_static</code> 



<p>Start up an Agent for each controller Richard, Elayne, Ramiel, and Zaqiel. The <a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/workflow.sh#L242"><code>start_agents</code></a> function in <code>workflow.sh</code> shows one way to do this.</p>



 Switching between the KLI and the KERI Agent API (Mark I – deprecated) 



<p>For the remainder of this tutorial we switch back and forth between the KERI command line interface, the KLI, and the KERI Agent HTTP API, the Mark I version in KERIpy, in order to present a broad understanding of both the ways you can interact with the KERI specification and the work that has been completed in the space. This will provide an opportunity to understand both how the command line interaction looks as well as how a REST API addressing a similar purpose feels and looks.</p>



<p>Each task will be completed first with the KLI and then with the KERI Agent API. The KLI is always up to date with the latest and greatest code in KERIpy. The KERI Agent API will likely eventually be removed from KERIpy once the Mark II agent in <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keria">KERIA</a> is finished. At present the KERI Agent API in the KERIpy repository is now deprecated and is referred to as the Mark I agent.</p>



<p>For our next task of creating keystores we start first with the KERI Command Line Interface (KLI) to initialize the keystores for all of the participants in this journey including the ATHENA officials and the two explorers. After showing how to accomplish this task with the KLI we switch to perform the same task with the Agent API.</p>



 Use one or the other for keystores and inception 



<p>Make sure to either use the KLI or the Agent API to perform keystore creation and inception, not both. You only need to create the keystores once whether your use the KLI or the Agent API.</p>



<p>If you don’t know which one you want or need for your scenario then start with the KLI.</p>



 KERI Keystores and Inception 



 KERI Controller Keystore Create – KLI INIT 



<p>There are four keystores to initialize. We will show here the commands to initialize one of the keystores. After performing this command you can initialize all of the other keystores yourself with similar commands for each keystore or use the <code>make_keystores_and_incept_kli</code> function in the <code>workflow.sh</code> script.</p>


 
 


 Salts 



<p>The cryptographic salt is one of the arguments to <code>kli init</code>. This salt is what all of the private keys are derived from so it should be protected as if you were protecting your personal identity documents or your bank account. You can get your own salt with the <code>kli salt</code> command:</p>



 <code>$ kli salt
0ACPpGmPWX9LqRlUCOLH3qk2</code> 



<p>You can use the salt in any <code>--salt</code> argument via the KLI or a <code>"salt"</code> property of a Agent request.</p>



 Command 



<p>The other arguments are straightforward, nopasscode, config-dir, and config-file. <code>--nopasscode</code> indicates that there is no passcode to access this keystore. </p>



<p>The <code>--config-dir</code> property indicates the directory in which to look for configuration files. Inside this configuration directory the file name from the <code>--config-file</code> option is used to find and select the controller bootstrap configuration file that will be used to initialize this keystore. This option does not need to have a file extension if your configuration file already ends with the “.json” extension.</p>



 <code>kli init --name ${EXPLORER_KEYSTORE} --salt "${EXPLORER_SALT}" \
  --nopasscode \
  --config-dir "${CONFIG_DIR}" \
  --config-file "${CONTROLLER_BOOTSTRAP_FILE}"</code> 



<p>This command sets up all of the <a href="http://www.lmdb.tech/doc/">Lightning Memory Mapped Database</a> instances used by the keystore. These are located in the $HOME/.keri directory.</p>



 KERI Controller AID (Prefix) Create and Incept – KLI INCEPT 



<p>Now the keystore is ready to have a specific key pair created and an inception event performed. This will begin the key event log (KEL) for that key pair. Key pairs are referred to with a label called an “alias.” This alias label is intended to be more human-friendly and is used throughout both the KLI and the Agent API to refer to the key pair.</p>



 Alias vs Prefix 



<p>Aliases are used to refer to key pairs since prefixes, the internal reference to key pairs, are not human friendly. For example, an alias can be a word or set of words like “richard” and a prefix looks like the following: <code>"EJS0-vv_OPAQCdJLmkd5dT0EW-mOfhn_Cje4yzRjTv8q"</code>. As you can see you won’t be remembering many prefixes which is why the alias system is so helpful.</p>



 Steps to Inception 



<p>Performing an inception event, once the keystore is initialized, requires the following two steps:</p>



 
 Write an inception configuration file. 



 Execute the inception command whether from the command line or the Agent REST API
 
 For the KLI you will provide the inception configuration file as an argument. 



 For the Agent API you will provide the inception configuration as JSON in the body of the inception HTTP request. 
 
 
 



<p>Four inception events need to be performed on each of the four keystores. Each inception event begins a <a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#7c43">key event log</a> (KEL), as shown below:</p>


 
 


<p>First we write the inception configuration file.</p>



 Writing a Controller Inception Configuration File 



<p>Each attribute of a controller inception configuration file is important. The initial set of witnesses, keypair counts, key thresholds, transferability, and threshold of acceptable duplicity are all defined in this file. </p>



<p>The following is the inception configuration file used for each of the controllers we create for the Abydos journey:</p>



 <code>{
  "transferable": true,
  "wits": [
    "BBilc4-L3tFUnfM_wJr4S4OJanAv_VmF_dJNN6vkf2Ha",
    "BLskRTInXnMxWaGqcpSyMgo0nYbalW99cGZESrz3zapM",
    "BIKKuvBwpmDVA4Ds-EpL5bt9OqPzWPja2LigFYZN2YfX"
  ],
  "toad": 3,
  "icount": 1,
  "ncount": 1,
  "isith": "1",
  "nsith": "1"
}</code> 



 Witness configuration file attributes 



<p>Now an explanation of each attribute, which may also be seen in <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy/blob/446eca9a694166e24416221ec49736cb071cd790/src/keri/app/habbing.py#L888">keripy/src/keri/app/habbing.pyL873</a> and in <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy/blob/446eca9a694166e24416221ec49736cb071cd790/src/keri/app/cli/common/incepting.py#L9">keripy/src/keri/app/cli/common/incepting.pyL9</a>:</p>



 
 “transferable” – <a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#7344">Transferability</a> refers to whether a KERI autonomic identifier (AID) can have its keys rotated. Technically this refers to having what is called “control authority” changed, control over the private keypairs linked to a KERI AID. <br>When true this means the AID is a transferable AID.<br>When false this means the AID is non-transferable. 



 “wits”: Witnesses – A list of prefixes identifying the witnesses to include signatures for in the inception event in this controller’s key event log. 



 “toad”: Threshold of acceptable duplicity – The number of agreeing witnesses receipts at or above which the controller accepts accountability for signed key events. Accountability is not accepted by the controller for key events with a number of signatures below this threshold. 



 “icount”: Inception signature count – The number of keys used to sign the inception event. 



 “ncount”: Number of rotation signatures count – The number of keys to be used on the next key rotation event. Note that not all pre-rotated keys committed to in the inception event as described <a href="https://weboftrust.github.io/ietf-keri/draft-ssmith-keri.html#name-reserve-rotation">Reserve Rotation</a>. 



 “isith”: Signing threshold for the inception event – The number of key event receipts from distinct witnesses the Inception Event must have in order to be authoritative. 



 “nsith”: Signing threshold for the next rotation event – The number of key event receipts from distinct witnesses the next Rotation Event must have in order to be authoritative. 
 



 Writing your configuration 



<p>For all except the “wits” section you can copy and paste the configuration file as-is. The “wits” section contains the AID prefixes that will be specific to your witnesses. If you are using the <code>workflow.sh</code> script with precisely the same salts, witness keystore names, and witness AID aliases, then you can use the configuration from above.</p>



<p>Place all of your configuration in a JSON file in a configuration directory you will remember the location of that you can reference when passing in the <code>--file</code> argument to the <code>kli incept</code> command below. In the Abydos Tutorial repo this path is “<code>abydos-tutorial/conf/inception-config.json</code>“.</p>



 Performing Inception – KLI INCEPT 



<p>Incepting a keypair consists of:</p>



 
 Creating the number of cryptographic key pairs as indicated in the “icount” configuration property. 



 Creating the number of pre-rotated cryptographic key pairs as indicated in the “ncount” configuration property. 



 Creating a valid, properly formatted inception event signed by all of the keys included in the “icount” set. 



 Adding that inception event to the controller’s key event log. 



 Sending the inception event to each witness in set of witnesses configured in the inception configuration you wrote above. <br>The set of witnesses is defined in the configuration file passed to the <code>--file</code> argument. 



 Receiving key event receipts (KERs) of the inception event from each witness. 



 Adding the key event receipts from the witnesses to the key event receipt log (KERL) for the controller.  
 



<p>All of these steps are performed for you when you execute the <code>kli incept</code> command. The below example from <code>workflow.sh</code> shows the inception of Richard’s AID:</p>



 <code>kli incept --name ${EXPLORER_KEYSTORE} --alias ${EXPLORER_ALIAS} \
  --file "${CONTROLLER_INCEPTION_CONFIG_FILE}"</code> 



<p>Repeat this procedure for each Elayne, Ramiel, and Zaqiel with the keystore and alias names indicated in the BASH variables at the top of the <code>workflow.sh</code> script in the <a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial">Abydos Tutorial repository</a>.</p>



<p>Next, for those who are using agents, we show how to use the KERI Mark I Agent to perform keystore setup and inception.</p>



 KERI Controller Keystore Create – Agent (Mark I – deprecated) 



<p>Keep in mind that you only need to create the keystores once whether you create the keystores with the KLI or the Agent API. Only proceed to create the keystores and perform inception with the Agent API if you have not already done so with the KLI.</p>



<p>Setting up a KERI controller keystore and AID with an agent involves the following three REST requests:</p>



 
 POST to <code>/boot</code> to initialize the keystore
 
 This is similar to the <code>kli init</code> command. 
 
 



 PUT to <code>/boot</code> to unlock the keystore
 
 This does not have a direct analogue with the KLI though the <code>--passcode</code> argument used with <code>kli init</code>, <code>kli incept</code>, and many other KLI commands serves a similar purpose. 
 
 



 POST to <code>/ids/${ALIAS}</code> to perform the inception event
 
 This is similar to the <code>kli incept</code> command. 
 
 
 



<p>Data in the request bodies for each of these requests is very similar to the command line argument data for each of the corresponding commands using the KLI.</p>



 curl Common Headers, arguments, and pipes 



 Headers 



<p>The “Accept: */*” and “Content-Type: application/json” HTTP headers are common to all of the commands used in the <code>workflow.sh</code> scripts.</p>



 Arguments 



<p>The “-s” argument to cURL is the “silent” option and ensures that only the response body of the target HTTP request is sent to the standard output channel.</p>



<p>The backslash <a href="https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html#Escape-Character">“\” escape character</a> is often used in BASH scripts to make commands more readable by enabling splitting of the commands across multiple lines.</p>



 Pipes 



<p>jq: Heavy usage of the <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a> program, a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON parser, is made throughout this tutorial. Most often the results of a cURL command will be piped to the jq program and then the jq program will select an attribute from the response  body using a selector expression like <code>'.["msg"]'</code> in the example below.</p>



<p>tr: Frequently the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tr_(Unix)">tr</a> program is used to trim double quotes off of the JSON output returned from the jq program. As seen in the example below tr is used with the <code>-d</code> flag to delete all tokens of the specified set from input. This is needed since often the value of a cURL request needs to be placed in a BASH variable and the extra quotes returned along with the JSON body are problematic to deal with an so it is easier to remove them altogether.</p>



<p>Both jq and tr are often used together in a sequence as shown below.</p>



 <code>...(more code causing JSON to be sent to standard out)... \
| jq '.["msg"]' | tr -d '"'</code> 



 KERI Controller Keystore Create – Agent 



<p>This operation is a POST to the <code>/boot</code> endpoint which creates a keystore where the body is a JSON object with the value placed in the “name” property of the JSON body used to name the keystore. The “salt” value is the cryptographic salt used as the cryptographic seed to derive all key pairs in the keystore. You can use the <code>kli salt</code> command to generate a new salt.</p>



<p>The <code>${EXPLORER_AGENT_URL}</code> is define on <a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/workflow.sh#L127">Line 127 of workflow.sh</a> and looks like this:<br><a href="http://127.0.0.1:5620">http://127.0.0.1:5620</a></p>



 <code>curl -s -X POST "${EXPLORER_AGENT_URL}/boot" \
  -H 'accept: */*' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data "{\"name\": \"${EXPLORER_KEYSTORE}\",
           \"salt\": \"${EXPLORER_SALT}\"}" \
  | jq '.["msg"]' | tr -d '"'</code> 



<p>As you can see the “name” and “salt” options are similar to the similarly named arguments to KLI init. The difference here is that they are in the body of the POST request as JSON. The result is piped to “jq” and then “tr” to extract and print the result message to the terminal.</p>



<p>Next the keystore must be unlocked.</p>



 KERI Controller Keystore Unlock – Agent 



<p>Unlocking a keystore is a PUT to the <code>/boot</code> endpoint using the same JSON body as was POSTed to initialize the keystore. This is used to permit a particular Agent to work with a specified keystore. This is useful because an agent may have been restarted after initializing the keystore and so the Agent must establish an authenticated connection to the keystore.</p>



 <code>curl -s -X PUT "${EXPLORER_AGENT_URL}/boot" \
  -H 'accept: */*' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data "{\"name\": \"${EXPLORER_KEYSTORE}\",
           \"salt\": \"${EXPLORER_SALT}\"}" \
  | jq '.["msg"]' | tr -d '"'</code> 



<p>Next the keystore is ready to have an AID, also known as a prefix, created and incepted.</p>



 KERI Controller AID (Prefix) Create and Incept – Agent 



<p>Creating an AID requires submitting a POST request to the <code>/ids/{alias}</code> path of a controller agent. The body of the request is the same controller inception configuration file you wrote earlier when performing <code>kli incept</code>. The file is reproduced below for reference:</p>



 Inception Configuration File 



 <code>{
  "transferable": true,
  "wits": [
    "BBilc4-L3tFUnfM_wJr4S4OJanAv_VmF_dJNN6vkf2Ha",
    "BLskRTInXnMxWaGqcpSyMgo0nYbalW99cGZESrz3zapM",
    "BIKKuvBwpmDVA4Ds-EpL5bt9OqPzWPja2LigFYZN2YfX"
  ],
  "toad": 3,
  "icount": 1,
  "ncount": 1,
  "isith": "1",
  "nsith": "1"
}</code> 



<p>The contents of this file are placed in the body of the HTTP request as submitted below:</p>



 <code>curl -s -X POST "${EXPLORER_AGENT_URL}/ids/${EXPLORER_ALIAS}" \
  -H 'accept: */*' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data @${CONTROLLER_INCEPTION_CONFIG_FILE} \
  | jq '.["d"]' | tr -d '"'</code> 



<p>The jq and tr pipes here select the AID prefix that comes in the response body of the request. You can see on <a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/workflow.sh#L471">Line 471 of workflow.sh</a> this sequence is used to capture Richard’s prefix and store it in the <code>RICHARD_PREFIX</code> bash variable.</p>



 Keystore and Inception Review 



<p>Once you get the hang of creating keystores and performing inception events then you will see the similarities between the KLI and the Agent API. When you have finished creating all of the keystores you need, one each for the Explorer, Librarian, Wise Man, and Gatekeeper, then you are ready to move on to the next step for connecting all of the agents together using out of band introductions, or OOBIs.</p>



 Out of Band Introductions (OOBIs) Between Controllers 



<p>Routes in a routing table or DNS entries are internet discovery system analogues to help understand the purpose out of band introductions. ATHENA requires a number of components in the Abydos network to talk to each other and thus an OOBI must be created or “resolved” for each connection between components.</p>


 
 


<p>You can think of an OOBI as an address with a role for one controller to contact either another controller or a KERI resource such as a credential schema. In order for one controller to be able to issue a credential to another controller it must know where that other controller is. The role</p>



<p>For example, in the diagram above, in order for Ramiel to issue the TreasureHuntingJourney credential to Richard he must have an OOBI that shows the location of Richard that includes a witness for Richard. This witness is necessary so Ramiel can verify that the KEL sent from Richard matches up to the AID prefix included in the OOBI URL. component that knows Richard. In this case that is the “wan” witness</p>



 OOBIs described 



<p>Out of band introductions (OOBIs) are the discovery mechanism for KERI controllers and KERI objects such as ACDC Schemas or cached ACDCs. OOBIs tell one controller how to reach another controller or object and are identified both by an AID prefix as well as an alias label.</p>



<p>The terminology “out-of-band” here refers to the fact that the general purpose internet infrastructure like IP routers, gateways, and DNS servers, are not part of KERI and are thus out-of-band with respect to KERI. The primary advantage to using this general purpose infrastructure for service discovery means KERI doesn’t have to provide it’s own discovery mechanism since it can piggy back on the existing internet infrastructure.</p>



<p>Discovery over the internet includes endpoint discovery of witnesses, watchers, and other network participants including <a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#285f">jurors</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#28f1">judges</a> (not yet implemented). According to the <a href="https://weboftrust.github.io/ietf-oobi/draft-ssmith-oobi.html">Out-Of-Band-Introduction (OOBI) Protocol</a> specification:</p>



<blockquote><p>[OOBIs provide] a discovery mechanism that associates a given URI or URL with a given AID (Autonomic IDentifier) or SAID (Self-Addressing IDentifier)&nbsp;[<a href="https://weboftrust.github.io/ietf-oobi/draft-ssmith-oobi.html#KERI_ID">KERI_ID</a>][<a href="https://weboftrust.github.io/ietf-oobi/draft-ssmith-oobi.html#KERI">KERI</a>][<a href="https://weboftrust.github.io/ietf-oobi/draft-ssmith-oobi.html#SAID_ID">SAID_ID</a>][<a href="https://weboftrust.github.io/ietf-oobi/draft-ssmith-oobi.html#OOBI_ID">OOBI_ID</a>]. The URI provided by an OOBI acts as a service endpoint for the discovery of verifiable information about the AID or SAID. As such an OOBI itself is not trusted but must be verified.</p>Out-Of-Band-Introduction (OOBI) Protocol IETF Draft specification – S. M. smith</blockquote>



<p>In the specification the usage of the terms “endpoint” or “service endpoint” just mean the URL to use to access some KERI resource.</p>



 OOBIs must be verified 



<p>The above quote draws attention to the fact that that OOBI URLs themselves are not trustable and must be verified. What does this mean? What is being verified? Since OOBI URLs merely point to a controller’s AID (prefix) the OOBU must be used to retrieve the full key event log from that controller referenced by the prefix. This key event log is then verified using the witness identified by the witness prefix at the end of the OOBI, in the case of a witness OOBI. If the controller proves control over the key referenced by the KEL then the verifier of the OOBI can then trust they have securely discovered the controller referenced by the OOBI.</p>



<p>A witness OOBI looks like the following example:</p>



 <code>"http://127.0.0.1:5642/oobi/EJS0-vv_OPAQCdJLmkd5dT0EW-mOfhn_Cje4yzRjTv8q/witness/BBilc4-L3tFUnfM_wJr4S4OJanAv_VmF_dJNN6vkf2Ha"</code> 



<p>The template for this OOBI URL is as follows:</p>



 <code>[proto]://[wit host]:[wit port]/oobi/[controller prefix]/[role]/[wit prefix]</code> 



 OOBIs may have roles 



<p>This is an OOBI that shows a witness for a given prefix. This type of OOBI includes a “witness” role and a witness prefix. This witness prefix corresponds to the witness host and port earlier in the OOBI URL. This witness will have a full key event log of all of that controller’s key events and thus can be used to verify that the controller’s KEL matches to the controller prefix included in the OOBI URL. This verification process is a part of what is known as “resolving” an OOBI.</p>



<p>See <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy/blob/446eca9a694166e24416221ec49736cb071cd790/src/keri/kering.py#L23">kering.py:L23</a> for a full list of other OOBI roles including controller, witness, registrar, watcher, judge, juror, peer, mailbox, and agent, at present.</p>



 Richard to Ramiel OOBIs – pairwise exchange 



<p>The following modified OOBI diagram shows greater detail of what the OOBIs exchanged between Richard and Ramiel look like. Since both Ramiel and Richard exchange OOBIs with each other this is called a pairwise OOBI exchange.</p>


 
 


<p>Since both witness OOBIs use the “wan” witness to resolve key state they have a secondary arrow pointing to wan in addition to their primary arrow to indicate this relationship.</p>



<p>In general, each controller wanting to communicate with another controller must resolve an OOBI with the target controller that describes where the controller is located over the internet so that the source controller can send messages to that destination controller. </p>



<p>In the case of Ramiel an OOBI must be resolved for both Elayne and Richard in order for Ramiel to issue the TreasureHuntingJourney credential to them. Similarly, Elayne and Richard both must resolve an OOBI that describes where Ramiel is located over the internet. All of these introductions are performed in both the <code><a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/workflow.sh#L525">make_introductions_kli</a></code> and <code><a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/workflow.sh#L581">make_introductions_agent</a></code> functions in the <code>workflow.sh</code> script.</p>



 Abydos OOBIs 



<p>The journey to Abydos requires that each controller is known for a certain reason. These reasons may include:</p>



 
 Credential Issuance: an issuing controller must have an OOBI for the isuee’s controller who will receive the credential. This is the case when Ramiel needs to issue the TreasureHuntingJourney credential to both Richard and Elayne. Likewise, Richard must know how to contact Ramiel in order to issue him the JourneyMarkRequest credential. 



 Credential Presentation: a credential holding controller must have the OOBI for the target node they will be sending a credential presentation to so that the presentation can reach the intended destination. This is the case when Richard and Elayne want to send the JourneyCharter credential to Zaqiel in order to be permitted entrance into Abydos. 
 



<p>These OOBI introductions are the controller-to-controller OOBIs needed during network operation. Keep in mind that there were OOBIs resolved in network setup and configuration for each of the witnesses as well as the four credential schemas used.</p>



<p>Use the commands below to perform all of the needed OOBI introductions as indicated on the graphic below.</p>


 
 


 Controller Introductions – KLI 



<p>Using the KLI to resolve a witness OOBI for a controller involves</p>



 
 specifying the target keystore with the <code>--name</code> argument,  



 setting an OOBI alias with the <code>--oobi-alias</code> property and  



 passing in a witness OOBI to the <code>--oobi</code> argument as shown below. 
 



 <code>kli oobi resolve --name ${WISEMAN_KEYSTORE} \
  --oobi-alias ${EXPLORER_ALIAS} \
  --oobi ${WAN_WITNESS_URL}/oobi/${RICHARD_PREFIX}/witness/${WAN_PREFIX}</code> 



<p>An OOBI resolution is a very simple operation and produces output similar to the following:</p>



 <code>http://127.0.0.1:5642/oobi/EJS0-vv_OPAQCdJLmkd5dT0EW-mOfhn_Cje4yzRjTv8q/witness/BBilc4-L3tFUnfM_wJr4S4OJanAv_VmF_dJNN6vkf2Ha resolved</code> 



 Controller Introductions – Agent (Mark I – deprecated) 



<p>Using the Agent API to resolve an OOBI is very similar to the KLI. All the properties are passed in through the HTTP request body as a JSON object as shown below.</p>



 <code>curl -s -X POST "${WISEMAN_AGENT_URL}/oobi" \
  -H "accept: */*" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"oobialias\": \"${EXPLORER_ALIAS}\",       
       \"url\":\"${WAN_WITNESS_URL}/oobi/${RICHARD_PREFIX}/witness/${WAN_PREFIX}\"}" \
  | jq</code> 



<p>This should result in a 202 HTTP status code when successful.</p>



<p>Once you have performed all OOBI creations for the controllers as depicted in the diagram above then move on to creating credential registries.</p>



 Credential Registries 


 
 


<p>In order to issue credentials from one controller to the next a credential registry must exist in both the issuing controller’s keystore to create and issue the credential from as well as in the receiving controller’s (issuee’s) keystore to receive the issued credential. This requires adding a new concept to manage the credential registry as well as any credentials issued from the registry. Enter the transaction event log <a href="https://github.com/trustoverip/acdc/wiki/transaction-event-log">transaction event log</a> (TEL).</p>



 Transaction Event Logs (TELs) 



<p>A transaction event log is a log of all events occurring for a verifiable credential or a credential registry that manages verifiable credentials. All TEL events are anchored in a KEL in either <code>ixn</code> (interaction) or <code>rot</code> (rotation) events. This is the foundation enabling a verifiable credential protocol to be built on top of KERI. This protocol is known as the authentic chained data container, or ACDC protocol. See the <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/draft-ssmith-acdc.html">ACDC specification</a> for a complete description of this protocol.</p>



<p>Two further sub-protocols within the ACDC paradigm further elaborate on creating registries and handling the verifiable credential lifecycle. These are the Public Transaction Event Logs (PTEL) and the Issuance and Presentation Exchange (IPEX) protocols. </p>



 Public Transaction Event Logs (PTEL) protocol 



<p>PTEL has two major parts the first being the details of using transaction event logs (TELs) to connect ACDCs to key event logs (KELs) and the second being the handling of events in the lifecycle of a credential including issuance and revocation. </p>



<p>There are two types of TELs:</p>



 
 A <a href="https://weboftrust.github.io/ietf-ptel/draft-pfeairheller-ptel.html#name-management-tel">management TEL</a> for managing an ACDC (credential) registry and tracks the list of Registrars that will act as Backers for individual TELs for each verifiable credential (VC). 



 A <a href="https://weboftrust.github.io/ietf-ptel/draft-pfeairheller-ptel.html#name-verifiable-credential-tels">Verifiable Credential TEL</a> (VC TEL) for managing the issued and revoked state of an individual ACDC. The VC TEL also contains a reference to its corresponding management TEL. There are only two events in a VC TEL which are the issuance and then a subsequent revocation, if ever. 
 



<p>PTEL describes the details of transaction event logs. The following introduction from the <a href="https://weboftrust.github.io/ietf-ptel/draft-pfeairheller-ptel.html">PTEL specification</a> summarizes well the purpose of transaction event logs:</p>



<blockquote><p>The&nbsp;Transaction Event Log&nbsp;(TEL) is a hash linked data structure of transactions that can be used to track state. A&nbsp;Public Verifiable Credential Registry&nbsp;can be represented in several TELs to establish issuance or revocation state of a Verifiable Credential (VC). The KEL is used to establish control authority over the keys used to commit to the events of the TEL and sign the VC. The events of the TEL are used to establish the issuance or revocation state of the VCs issued by the controller of the identifier represented by the KEL.</p>Public Transaction Event Logs (PTEL) IETF Draft Specification – P. Feairheller</blockquote>



 Issuance and Presentation Exchange (IPEX) protocol 



<p>Building upon the PTEL specification IPEX describes what happens between credential registries. This protocol defines the disclosure workflow events used to share information between the Discloser and the Disclosee.</p>



<blockquote><p>The Issuance and Presentation Exchange (IPEX) Protocol provides a uniform mechanism for the issuance and presentation of ACDCs&nbsp;[<a href="https://weboftrust.github.io/ietf-ipex/draft-ssmith-ipex.html#ACDC-ID">ACDC-ID</a>]&nbsp;in a securely attributable manner.</p>Issuance and Presentation Exchange Protocol IETF Draft specification – S. M. Smith, P. Feairheller</blockquote>



 Registry Creation 


 
 


<p>A registry creation event occurs in a TEL and has the type <code>vcp</code>. See the “<a href="https://weboftrust.github.io/ietf-ptel/draft-pfeairheller-ptel.html#name-verifiable-credential-regis">Verifiable Credential Registry</a>” section of the PTEL specification for a complete description of TEL event types. To avoid overburdening the diagram below the individual <code>ixn</code> events for each credential issuance are not included in the KEL nor are the <code>iss</code> events included in the TELs. The blue credential graphic to the right is used on successive versions of the diagram to represent credential issuances.</p>



<p>The below diagram shows the registry creation event as an interaction event in the KEL of each controller as well as the corresponding TEL created to manage the creation of each credential issued by or to each controller. </p>


 
 


<p>The IN column in a TEL indicates credentials the controller has received.<br>The OUT column in a TEL indicates credentials the controller has issued.</p>



<p>Both of these columns start out empty and will be filled as credentials are issued.</p>



 Registry Creation – KLI 



<p>All that is needed to create a registry is:</p>



 
 a keystore name with the <code>--name</code> argument to select the keystore to create the registry inside of, 



 an alias with the <code>--alias</code> argument to select the AID to use to issue credentials from that registry, 



 and the name of the registry with the <code>--registry-name</code> argument. 
 



 <code>kli vc registry incept --name ${EXPLORER_KEYSTORE} \
  --alias ${EXPLORER_ALIAS} \
  --registry-name ${EXPLORER_REGISTRY}</code> 



<p>This creates a registry named by the <code>--registry-name</code> argument value with a management TEL. The registry’s management TEL will be used to keep track of the backers for each credential.</p>



<p>Additional arguments accepted by the command not shown above include:</p>



 
 <code>--nonce</code>: unique random value to seed the credential registry. 



 <code>--no-backers</code>: boolean to not allow setting up backers different from the anchoring KEL. 



 <code>--establishment-only</code>: boolean to only allow establishment events for the anchoring of events in this registry. 



 <code>--backers</code>: the new set of backers different from the anchoring KEL witnesses to be used when setting backers for credentials from this registry. Can appear multiple times. 



 <code>--base</code>, <code>--alias</code>, and <code>--passcode</code> like the <code>kli init</code> and <code>kli incept</code> commands. 
 



<p>There is no TOAD (threshold of acceptable duplicity) argument for the KLI since as of March 2023 it has not been needed nor has the external backer feature been used or tested in production. Nonetheless a default TOAD is computed based on the length of the backer list sent in as you can see on <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy/blob/446eca9a694166e24416221ec49736cb071cd790/src/keri/vdr/eventing.py#L95">Line 95 of eventing.py</a>. If you need this feature then be sure to open an issue on the KERIpy GitHub repo and attend a <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keri#meetings">community dev meeting</a> (every other Tuesday at 8 AM UTC-6 DST / UTC-7 Non-DST).</p>



 Registry Creation – Agent (Mark I – deprecated) 



<p>Creating a registry using the Agent API is similar to the KLI except that the values passed as arguments to <code>kli vc registry incept</code> are instead located in the body as a JSON object.</p>



 <code>curl -s -X POST "${EXPLORER_AGENT_URL}/registries" \
  -H "accept: */*" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"alias\":\"${EXPLORER_ALIAS}\",
       \"baks\": [],
       \"estOnly\":false,
       \"name\":\"${EXPLORER_REGISTRY}\",
       \"noBackers\":true,
       \"toad\":0}" \
  | jq</code> 



<p>Once again here the output is piped to “jq” though this is only to make the response easy on the eyes.</p>



<p>Next we move to one of the most exciting parts of this journey, the issuing of credentials!</p>



 Credential Issuance 


 
 


<p>Value generation from the entire decentralized identity space centers around verifiable credentials. Wrap some data attributes in a container defined by a schema and you now have a verifiable bearer instrument that is a part of your digital reputation. A credential is the fundamental unit, or currency, of reputation. </p>



 Name – Why ACDC? 



<p>Now where does the name authentic chained data container come from and how did it get attached to the verifiable credential space? Three points make this clear:</p>



 
 Since ACDC-style credentials are verifiable as authentic using the KERI decentralized key management infrastructure (DKMI), 



 since ACDC-style credentials can be easily chained as a directed, acyclic graph (DAG),  



 and since the schema of an ACDC creates a shape or container for data,  
 



<p>you can see how those concepts combined to create the name (1) authentic (2) chained (3) data container, or ACDC.</p>



 Purpose 



<p>The introductory quote from the ACDC spec sums up well the purpose of the ACDC protocol:</p>



<blockquote><p>One primary purpose of the ACDC protocol is to provide granular provenanced proof-of-authorship (authenticity) of their contained data via a tree or chain of linked ACDCs (technically a directed acyclic graph or DAG). Similar to the concept of a chain-of-custody, ACDCs provide a verifiable chain of proof-of-authorship of the contained data. […] <br><br>These proofs of authorship and/or authority provide provenance of an ACDC itself and by association any data that is so conveyed.</p>Authentic Chained Data Containers IETF Draft Specification – Dr. Samuel M. Smith</blockquote>



<p>Verifiable authorizations, permissions, rights, and credentials that include a full provenance chain anchored in key event logs make KERI an elegant way to capture and unlock reputation value as well as serve as a robust solution for identity and access management systems.</p>



<p>To learn in-depth about all the particulars for ACDCs read the <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/draft-ssmith-acdc.html">Authentic Chained Data Containers (ACDC) IETF draft specification</a> by Dr. Samuel M. Smith.</p>



<p>With this brief interlude on the name and purpose of ACDCs out of the way next we dive into the specific credentials we will issue for the journey to Abydos.</p>



 Credentials for Abydos 



<p>Multiple different credentials are issued during different parts of the overall ATHENA trust workflow in the journey to Abydos. The following graphic shows a small blue icon representing each issued (OUT) or received (IN) credential.</p>


 
 


<p>The four credentials that will be issued over the course of the journey include:</p>



 
 TreasureHuntingJourney: this is issued by the Wise Man to each of the explorers, Richard and Elayne, to tell them about a potential journey they could go on. It represents a commitment by ATHENA to a potential explorer as an offer of a journey they could embark upon. 



 JourneyMarkRequest: this is issued by an explorer to the Wise Man as a commitment to join the party for a particular TreasureHuntingJourney. Both Richard and Elayne issue this to Ramiel. 



 JourneyMark: this is issued by the Wise Man to an explorer as an acknowledgment that ATHENA accepted that explorer onto the requested TreasureHuntingJourney. This is issued by Ramiel to both Richard and Elayne. 



 JourneyCharter: once the party threshold for a journey is reached (threshold logic not yet implemented) the Wise Man issues a JourneyCharter credential to each party member who will be going on the journey. This includes Richard and Elayne. 
 



<p>On to our first credential!</p>



 Issue TreasureHuntingJourney Credential – KLI 



<p>The TreasureHuntingJourney must be issued to both Richard and Elayne as depicted in the graphic below. </p>


 
 


<p>As you see Ramiel has both of these credentials in the OUT column to indicate he has issued these credentials and both Richard and Elayne have them in the IN column indicating they have received these credentials.</p>



<p>The following command shows issuance of this credential to Richard.</p>



 <code>kli vc issue --name ${WISEMAN_KEYSTORE} \
  --alias ${WISEMAN_ALIAS} \
  --registry-name ${WISEMAN_REGISTRY} \
  --schema "${TREASURE_HUNTING_JOURNEY_SCHEMA_SAID}" \
  --recipient "${RICHARD_PREFIX}" \
  --data @"${ATHENA_DIR}"/credential_data/osireion-treasure-hunting-journey.json</code> 



<p>This shows issuance of a credential:</p>



 
 <code>--name</code>: from the Wise Man’s keystore 



 <code>--alias</code>: using the Ramiel AID  



 <code>--schema</code>: using the schema SAID of the TreasureHuntingJourney schema. 



 <code>--recipient</code>: The recipient is Richard 



 <code>--data</code>: and the data sent in is specific to the credential issued to Richard. 
 



<p>The only arguments we haven’t used yet for this command are as follows:</p>



 
 <code>--edges</code>: This is for adding the edge links to other credentials, the “chain” part of authentic chained data containers. We will see this in use for the next credential we issue, the JourneyMarkRequest. 



 <code>--rules</code>: This is where the Ricardian Contracts come in to ACDCs. The TreasureHuntingJourney credential did not use the <code>--rules</code> option since the rules were baked in to the schema definition. However, the JourneyMarkRequest schema is different and uses rules passed in. 
 



 Richard’s TreasureHuntingJourneyCredential Data 



 <code>{
  "destination": "Osireion",
  "treasureSplit": "50/50",
  "partyThreshold": 2,
  "journeyEndorser": "Ramiel"
}</code> 



<p>This is the data located in the <code><a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/athena/credential_data/osireion-treasure-hunting-journey.json">abydos-tutorial/athena/credential_data/osireion-treasure-hunting-journey.json</a></code> file. It is used for both Richard’s and Elayne’s credential.</p>



<p>Listing the credentials  while polling (causes messages to be delivered)</p>



<p>Once the credential is issued using <code>kli vc issue</code> it can take a few moments to arrive so the <code>kli vc list ... --poll</code> command is useful to wait for the credential to arrive.</p>



 <code>kli vc list --name ${EXPLORER_KEYSTORE} --alias ${EXPLORER_ALIAS} --poll</code> 



<p>The output of this command looks as follows:</p>



 <code>Checking mailboxes for any received credentials......

Current received credentials for richard (EJS0-vv_OPAQCdJLmkd5dT0EW-mOfhn_Cje4yzRjTv8q):

Credential #1: EE0MvGRafksqpzyCYXm6tfaiKYR9LpUsV8YGD8KSMRIS
    Type: Treasure Hunting Journey
    Status: Issued ✔
    Issued by EIaJ5gpHSL9nl1XIWDkfMth1uxbD-AfLkqdiZL6S7HkZ
    Issued on 2023-03-27T20:23:48.536543+00:00</code> 



<p>As long as you see the <code>Status: Issued ✔</code> then you can know you have issued the credential correctly.</p>



 Issue TreasureHuntingJourney Credential – Agent (Mark I – deprecated) 



<p>Issuing credentials with the Agent is very similar to the command line except all of the data arguments are added as JSON body attributes as shown below.</p>



 <code>JOURNEY_DATA=$(cat "${ATHENA_DIR}"/credential_data/osireion-treasure-hunting-journey.json)

curl -s -X POST "${WISEMAN_AGENT_URL}/credentials/${WISEMAN_ALIAS}" \
  -H "accept: application/json" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"credentialData\":${JOURNEY_DATA},
       \"recipient\":\"${RICHARD_PREFIX}\",
       \"registry\":\"${WISEMAN_REGISTRY}\",
       \"schema\":\"${TREASURE_HUNTING_JOURNEY_SCHEMA_SAID}\"}" \
  | jq '.["d"]' | tr -d '"'</code> 



<p>Once again I pipe the response to jq and tr to select the SAID of the credential which returns in the “d” field. This is useful to store the SAID in a BASH variable for use later in the <code>workflow.sh</code> script.</p>



 Get SAID of TreasureHuntingJourney credential issued 



<p>Another way to get the SAID of the TreasureHuntingJourney credential is by using a GET request to the <code>/credentials/</code>${ALIAS} endpoint.</p>



 <code>EXPLORER_JOURNEY_CRED_SAID=$(curl -s \
  -X GET "${EXPLORER_AGENT_URL}/credentials/${EXPLORER_ALIAS}?type=received&amp;schema=${TREASURE_HUNTING_JOURNEY_SCHEMA_SAID}" \
  | jq '.[0] | .sad.d' | tr -d '"')</code> 



<p>Use this GET request if you need to read in the SAID of a particular AID. The pipe combination to selects the “d” attribute from the first credential in the list (“.[0]”) returned.</p>



 Advanced Credential Issuance – with Edges and Rules 



 ACDCs with Edges 



<p>The preceding credential issuance of TreasureHuntingJourney credentials was interesting yet it did not include one of the critical features of ACDCs: edges. Since a graph of ACDCs is connected by edges then knowing how to use an edge to connect, or “chain,” credentials together enables you to represent your domain’s credential data as a graph data structure, specifically a directed acyclic graph, which is just an append-only data structure. The JourneyMarkRequest credential includes an edge that points to the TreasureHuntingJourney credential as shown in the graph below.</p>


 
 


<p>The edge from the JourneyMarkRequest is labeled as “journey”. This is represented in the schema for the JourneyMarkRequest as well as in the schema map JSON file that KASLCred reads in. Edges can be traversed to resolve, inspect, and validate the credential the edge points to.</p>



 ACDC Rules – Ricardian Contracts 



<p>We also show an alternate way to specify rules with the <code>--rules</code> option to the KLI and the “rules” property of the JSON object sent to the Agent.</p>



 Issue JourneyMarkRequest Credential – KLI 



<p>Once the JourneyMarkRequest Credentials are issued your network will be in the following state:</p>


 
 


<p>Both Richard and Elayne will have issued JourneyMarkRequest credentials to Ramiel and these credentials will have an edge pointing back to the TreasureHuntingJourney credential Ramiel issued to them. </p>



<p>A few steps are involved in issuing the JourneyMarkRequest credential due to the fact that it points to another credential, the TreasureHuntingJourney credential. These steps include:</p>



 
 Prepare the TreasureHuntingJourney edge 



 Saidify the TreasureHuntingJourney edge 



 Include the TreasureHuntingJourney edge inside the JourneyMarkRequest during issuance. 
 



 Prepare TresureHuntingJourney Edge 



<p>A few steps are required to prepare the TreasureHuntingJourney edge for inclusion in the JourneyMarkRequest credential. All of these steps are used to write a JSON file with the edge data that will be included to either the <code>--data</code> argument to <code>kli vc issue</code> with the KLI or embedded within the “source” attribute of the JSON object POSTed to <code>"/credentials/{alias}</code>” with the Agent.</p>



 JQ filters 



<p>JQ filters are useful to write values to a JQ object which eventually will become JSON. See the “Object Construction” section of the “<a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/#TypesandValues">Types and Values</a>” section of the JQ documentation for a full explanation. In the below code, as well as in the <code><a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/workflow.sh#L697">issue_treasurehuntingjourney_credentials_agent</a></code> function in <code>workflow.sh</code> the following JQ object is used to construct an edge:</p>



 <code>{  
  d: \"\", 
  journey: {
    n: ., 
    s: \"${TREASURE_HUNTING_JOURNEY_SCHEMA_SAID}\"
  }
}</code> 



<p>The BASH variable “TREASURE_HUNTING_JOURNEY_SCHEMA_SAID” is added in before the <code>echo</code> statement writes that JQ object to the file “JOURNEY_EDGE_FILTER”. This SAID is what it seems, the SAID of the TreasureHuntingJourney ACDC Schema. This is written into the JQ filter object.</p>



<p>JQ is then used to add the “EXPLORER_JOURNEY_SAID” into the “n” field of the JQ filter using the period “.” expression with the input piped into <code>jq</code> to output the resulting edge JSON.</p>



 <code>JOURNEY_EDGE_FILTER=${ATHENA_DIR}/credential_edges/richard-journey-edge-filter.jq

RICHARD_JOURNEY_EDGE=${ATHENA_DIR}/credential_edges/richard-journey-edge.json

echo "{d: \"\", journey: {n: ., s: \"${TREASURE_HUNTING_JOURNEY_SCHEMA_SAID}\"}}" &gt;"${JOURNEY_EDGE_FILTER}"

EXPLORER_JOURNEY_SAID=$(kli vc list --name ${EXPLORER_KEYSTORE} \
  --alias ${EXPLORER_ALIAS} \
  --said \
  --schema "${TREASURE_HUNTING_JOURNEY_SCHEMA_SAID}")

echo \""${EXPLORER_JOURNEY_SAID}"\" \
  | jq -f "${JOURNEY_EDGE_FILTER}" &gt;"${RICHARD_JOURNEY_EDGE}"

kli saidify --file "${RICHARD_JOURNEY_EDGE}"

# Add SAID to the JourneyMarkRequest rules
kli saidify --file "${ATHENA_DIR}"/credential_rules/journey-mark-request-rules.json</code> 



 SAIDify TreasureHuntingJourneyEdge 



<p>Finally after writing the edge JSON the file is SAIDified with <code>kli saidify</code>. This populates the “d” attribute of the JSON with a self addressing identifier, or SAID. A self addressing identifier, according to the <a href="https://weboftrust.github.io/ietf-said/draft-ssmith-said.html#section-1-2">spec</a>, is:</p>



<blockquote><p>is a special class of content-addressable identifier that is also self-referential […] this approach of deriving self-referential identifiers from the contents they identify, is called&nbsp;<code>self-addressing</code>. It allows any validator to verify or re-derive the&nbsp;<code>self-referential, self-addressing identifier</code>&nbsp;given the contents it identifies.</p>Self-Addressing Identifier (SAID) IETF Draft Specification – Dr. Samuel M. Smith</blockquote>



<p>This essentially means the value of the “d” field is computed from the value of everything else in the JSON object and as such is a value derived from everything else in the JSON object, thus self-addressing. Read the spec to learn about the specialized derivation function required to verify a SAID.</p>



<p>The following is an example of a complete TreasureHuntingJourney edge:</p>



 <code>{
  "d": "EGRPqBFL0xM0CPeTyc487pfO-MtR5UlYub0S-Rpyx6nm",
  "journey": {
    "n": "EE0MvGRafksqpzyCYXm6tfaiKYR9LpUsV8YGD8KSMRIS",
    "s": "EIxAox3KEhiQ_yCwXWeriQ3ruPWbgK94NDDkHAZCuP9l"
  }
}</code> 



<p>Once the SAIDified file is created then the “journey” edge is ready to be incorporated into the issuance of the JourneyMarkRequest credential.</p>



 Issue JourneyMarkRequest credential with edge 



<p>By now many of the options used below for <code>kli vc issue</code> will be familiar to you. Using the at symbol “<code>@</code>” in the arguments instructs the command to retrieve the contents of the file indicated by the file path. The command options in addition to <code>--name</code> and <code>--alias</code> describe above include:</p>



 
 <code>--registry-name</code> as the registry from which to issue the credential. 



 <code>--schema</code> indicating which ACDC schema to use. Value is the SAID from the “$id” field of the schema you are using to issue the credential with. 



 <code>--recipient</code> indicates who is receiving the issued ACDC. The value is the AID prefix for the recipient of the ACDC. An OOBI must resolved for the recipient’s prefix so that the issuer controller knows where to send the ACDC. 



 <code>--data</code> is the credential-specific data that is described by the “attributes” section of schema referenced by the <code>--schema</code> argument. 



 <code>--edges</code> is the JSON object that contains the edge definitions to link the credentials together. 



 <code>--rules</code> is the JSON object containing the Ricardian Contract definitions for this particular ACDC. 
 



 Data 



<p>An example of the data for this credential is as follows:</p>



 <code>{
  "requester": {
    "firstName": "Richard",
    "lastName": "Ayris",
    "nickname": "Dunkie"
  },
  "desiredPartySize": 2,
  "desiredSplit": 50.00
}</code> 



 Command 



 <code> kli vc issue --name ${EXPLORER_KEYSTORE} \
  --alias ${EXPLORER_ALIAS} \
  --registry-name ${EXPLORER_REGISTRY} \
  --schema "${JOURNEY_MARK_REQUEST_SCHEMA_SAID}" \
  --recipient "${WISEMAN_PREFIX}" \
  --data @"${ATHENA_DIR}"/credential_data/journey-mark-request-data-richard.json \
  --edges @"${RICHARD_JOURNEY_EDGE}" \
  --rules @"${ATHENA_DIR}"/credential_rules/journey-mark-request-rules.json</code> 



 List Credentials to see newly issued Request 



<p>Once again we wait for the credential to be issued with <code>kli vc list ... --poll</code> using the <code>--schema</code> SAID of the JourneyMarkRequest schema. This polls for all credentials the wise man has received under this schema. </p>



 <code>kli vc list --name ${WISEMAN_KEYSTORE} \
  --alias ${WISEMAN_ALIAS} \
  --schema "${JOURNEY_MARK_REQUEST_SCHEMA_SAID}" \
  --poll</code> 



<p>This will provide output similar to the following:</p>



 <code>Checking mailboxes for any received credentials......

Current received credentials for ramiel (EIaJ5gpHSL9nl1XIWDkfMth1uxbD-AfLkqdiZL6S7HkZ):

    Issued on 2023-03-28T22:20:03.452772+00:00</code> 



 Issue JourneyMarkRequest Credential – Agent (Mark I – deprecated) 



<p>Performing the issuance of the JourneyMarkRequest with the Mark I Agent is very similar to using. the KLI. The primary difference is that the JSON files passed in to <code>--data</code>, <code>--edges</code>, and <code>--rules</code> are placed inside the JSON body of the HTTP POST request to the <code>/credentials/{alias}/</code> route.</p>



 Prepare TreasureHuntingJourney Edge 



<p>The preparation steps here are pretty much identical to preparing the TreasureHuntingJourney edge for the KLI version of this section.</p>



 <code># Add SAID to JourneyMarkRequest rules
kli saidify --file "${ATHENA_DIR}"/credential_rules/journey-mark-request-rules.json

RICHARD_JOURNEY_EDGE_FILTER=${ATHENA_DIR}/credential_edges/richard-journey-edge-filter.jq
RICHARD_JOURNEY_EDGE=${ATHENA_DIR}/credential_edges/richard-journey-edge.json

echo "{d: \"\", journey: {n: ., s: \"${TREASURE_HUNTING_JOURNEY_SCHEMA_SAID}\"}}" &gt;"${RICHARD_JOURNEY_EDGE_FILTER}"

EXPLORER_JOURNEY_SAID=$(curl -s -X GET "${EXPLORER_AGENT_URL}/credentials/${EXPLORER_ALIAS}?type=received&amp;schema=${TREASURE_HUNTING_JOURNEY_SCHEMA_SAID}" | jq '.[0] | .sad.d' | tr -d '"')

echo \""${EXPLORER_JOURNEY_SAID}"\" | jq -f "${RICHARD_JOURNEY_EDGE_FILTER}" &gt;"${RICHARD_JOURNEY_EDGE}"

kli saidify --file "${RICHARD_JOURNEY_EDGE}"
</code> 



<p>Once you have the SAIDified edge file ready then you use it to issue the JourneyMarkRequest credential.</p>



 Issue JourneyMarkRequest Credential 



<p>To simplify issuing this credential from the <code>workflow.sh</code> script the contents of the JSON files for the data, rules, and edges are stored in BASH variables using the <code>VARNAME=$(cat FILENAME)</code> pattern. This makes it easy to include the contents in the <code>curl</code> command below.</p>



 <code>REQUEST_RULES=$(cat "${ATHENA_DIR}"/credential_rules/journey-mark-request-rules.json)
RICHARD_MARK_DATA=$(cat "${ATHENA_DIR}"/credential_data/journey-mark-request-data-richard.json)
RICHARD_EDGE_DATA=$(cat "${RICHARD_JOURNEY_EDGE}")

curl -s -X POST "${EXPLORER_AGENT_URL}/credentials/${EXPLORER_ALIAS}" \
  -H "accept: application/json" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"credentialData\":${RICHARD_MARK_DATA},
       \"recipient\":\"${WISEMAN_PREFIX}\",
       \"registry\":\"${EXPLORER_REGISTRY}\",
       \"schema\":\"${JOURNEY_MARK_REQUEST_SCHEMA_SAID}\",
       \"source\":${RICHARD_EDGE_DATA},
       \"rules\":${REQUEST_RULES}}" \
  | jq '.d' | tr -d '"'

# since there is no polling then sleep to wait for credential delivery
sleep 5</code> 



<p>There doesn’t exist an equivalent to <code>kli vc list ... --poll</code> in the KERIpy Mark I agent so you can perform a <code>sleep 5</code> or something similar for an equivalent wait to ensure that a request to <code>/credentials/{alias}/type=issued&amp;schema={schema_said}</code> will return the issued credential. You could also manually poll this endpoint, process the JSON array of credentials returned, and then continue to poll if the return body doesn’t contain the expected credential.</p>



<p>Next we move on to reviewing the listed credentials with a GET request.</p>



 List Credentials to see newly issued request 



<p>Make a GET request to the <code>/credentials/{alias}/type=issued&amp;schema={schema_said}</code> endpoint on a Mark I agent to get all credentials issued by that agent’s controller of the specified schema type. Below. I use <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Command-Substitution.html">command substitution</a> to encapsulate this sort of request as well as a pipe to jq and tr in order to retrieve the credential SAID for later use in the <code>workflow.sh</code> script.</p>



 <code>EXPLORER_REQUEST_CRED_SAID=$(curl -s -X GET "${EXPLORER_AGENT_URL}/credentials/${EXPLORER_ALIAS}?type=issued&amp;schema=${JOURNEY_MARK_REQUEST_SCHEMA_SAID}" | jq '.[0] | .sad.d' | tr -d '"')</code> 



<p>Executing the GET request to a controller, in this case the Wise Man, without the command substitution returns a response that looks similar to the following, with some attributes minimized:</p>


 
 


<p>There will be more than one credential returned if you issue this GET request after running the <code>workflow.sh</code> script.</p>



 Issuance Wrap Up 



 Issuing the JourneyMark Credential 



<p>Issuing the JourneyMark credential is essentially the same process as the JourneyMarkRequest issuance only with different data, edges, and rules. As a challenge for you try to issue this credential without reading the code in the <code><a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/workflow.sh#L834">issue_journeymark_credentials</a></code> and <code><a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/workflow.sh#L883">issue_journeymark_credentials_agent</a></code> functions in <code>workflow.sh</code>.</p>



<p>Once the JourneyMark credentials have been issued your issuance state will look like the following:</p>


 
 


<p>As you can see the JourneyMark credentials have been issued from Ramiel to both Richard and Elayne.</p>



 Issuing the JourneyCharter Credential 



<p>The presence of two edges in the edge file is the only substantive difference in issuing this credential as compared to the issuance of both the JourneyMarkRequest and the JourneyMark credential issuance processes. The finished edge file looks like this:</p>



 <code>{
  "d": "",
  "mark": {
    "n": "EI4Z_hKC7hzWfslkhGD8tGv0eMQCBpmVXx-sJ3Xugz8_",
    "s": "EBEefH4LNQswHSrXanb-3GbjCZK7I_UCL6BdD-zwJ4my"
  },
  "journey": {
    "n": "EPxgzkyYW6VdIx0cazHxioyiNMGDl01jlZwPD71hbBae",
    "s": "EIxAox3KEhiQ_yCwXWeriQ3ruPWbgK94NDDkHAZCuP9l"
  }
}</code> 



<p>As an added challenge to top it all off for this section take your knowledge of schema writing, schema linking, edge creation, and credential issuance and make your best attempt at assembling your own JourneyCharter edges file for use in issuing the JourneyCharter credential. If you get stuck you can look at the code in the <code><a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/workflow.sh#LL937C10-L937C42">issue_journeycharter_credentials</a></code> and <code><a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/workflow.sh#L998">issue_journeycharter_credentials_agent</a></code> functions from the <code>workflow.sh</code> script.</p>



 Final Credential Issuance State 



<p>Once all of the credentials have been issued you will have the state of your credential issuance as shown in the below picture.</p>


 
 


<p>This shows that Ramiel has issued the JourneyCharter to both Richard and Elayne.</p>



<p>With all of the credentials issued we can finally move on to one of the most exciting parts, Credential Presentation.</p>



 Credential Presentation 



<p>In order for a decentralized identity credentialing system to have any value it must be able to plug into a business process somewhere. Credential presentation is the beginning of plugging in a credentialing system to your custom business process logic. Your primary option here is to write a custom controller. The “<a href="https://github.com/GLEIF-IT/sally">Sally</a>” project is one such custom controller. It treats KERIpy as a library on top of which to layer in your custom business logic. I did precisely this in <a href="https://github.com/kentbull/sally">my fork</a> of Sally (a.k.a. Abydos Gatekeeper), which I explain below.</p>



<p>Custom business logic must plug directly in to the credential processing workflow within a controller and respond to credential validation actions that occur when a credential is presented based on whether the credential is issued or revoked. The point at which the custom business logic comes into contact with the decentralized identity system are in custom handler functions written in your custom controller.</p>



<p>A webhook is called from the custom handler functions to illustrate how you would signal controller events to an app, possibly a wallet app, waiting to be notified of event completions from the KERI Agent.</p>



 Presentation Handling Setup 



<p>In order to respond to the credential presentation we must do the following setup steps:</p>



 
 Ensure version 0.6.0 of the <a href="https://github.com/kentbull/sally">kentbull/sally</a> fork (a.k.a. Abydos Gatekeeper) is installed with <code>python -m pip install -e ./</code> from the fork repo root. 



 Write a credential type mapping file similar to the <code><a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/athena/schemas/schema-mappings.json">schema-mappings.json</a></code> file that pairs the ACDC schema SAIDs you wrote with credential type names that will be keyed off of in the custom controller. This is important so that the schema SAIDs you generated in your schema linking step match up with the ones the Abydos Gatekeeper (sally) expects. 



 Start the Abydos Gatekeeper (sally) with the appropriate command line arguments including the mapping file you wrote (or copied from the tutorial repo). 



 Start the webhook on the same port you specified when you started the Abydos Gatekeeper 



 Present the credential. 



 Await the webhook’s response to the credential. 
 



 Examples in workflow.sh script 



<p>All of these steps, except dependency installation, are written into the <code>workflow.sh</code> script.</p>



 
 The schema mappings file writing occurs on <a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/workflow.sh#L199">line 199 inside read_schema_saids</a>. Once again jq is used, this time with the <code>--null-input</code> argument, to write a JSON file based on a jq filter file, the <code><a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/athena/schemas/schema-mappings-filter.jq">schema-mappings-filter.jq</a></code> file. 



 The gatekeeper is started up in the <code><a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/workflow.sh#L512">start_gatekeeper</a></code> function. <br>You will see this includes the <code>--schema-mappings</code> argument that expects the schema mappings file you wrote earlier.<br>This also includes the <code>--web-hook</code> argument. Set this to be the web hook you started earlier. This will be <code>http://127.0.0.1:9923</code>.<br>Finally, the <code>--auth</code> argument must be set to the AID prefix of the Wise Man Ramiel so that the schema validation functions can allow Richard’s and Elayne’s JourneyCharter credentials to pass validation. 
 



<p>Next we walk through the code customizations made to the Sally server that enable responding to ATHENA-specific ACDC schema types.</p>



 Abydos Gatekeeper : Custom Controller Code for credential handlers 



<p>This is the most complicated, least explained portion of this tutorial. If you want to stay out of the inner details of the custom controller and out of KERIpy then just follow the commands listed in the <code>workflow.sh</code> script. On the other hand, if you are willing to venture into this depth I will assume you have some familiarity with Python as well as the bravery to confront the innards of the flow-based programming, hierarchical structured concurrency asynchronous runtime library Dr. Smith wrote, <code><a href="https://github.com/ioflo/hio">ioflo/hio</a></code>, that is at the core of both KERIpy and the Sally custom controller. </p>



<p>After reading through the controller code, or KERIpy code, you may find yourself wanting to write a custom controller either with a different async framework or another language, which are reasonable desires. I encourage you to dig a little deeper into the HIO code and the KERIpy code before rewriting it. I expect to have a future blog post on the HIO library as well as its usage in KERIpy, though do what. you think is most reasonable. I offer this suggestion just to encourage you to become familiar with the core KERI internals mostly so we can increase the core contributor count to KERIpy. Many hands make light work.</p>



 Communicator class 



<p>The <code><a href="https://github.com/kentbull/sally/blob/dev/src/sally/core/handling.py#L113">Communicator</a></code> class in <code>sally/src/sally/core/handling.py</code> is our main focus. The primary difference between the GLEIF-IT upstream repository and my fork of Sally is that I made a dict of schema handlers keyed by the names of credentials so it would be easy to swap in new schema SAIDs to be recognized as I wrote the schema files during initial development of the schemas. I also thought it readable and human-friendly to use schema type names like “TreasureHuntingJourney” as dict keys rather than schema prefixes like “EIxAox3KEhiQ_yCwXWeriQ3ruPWbgK94NDDkHAZCuP9l”.</p>



 <code># line 107-110 in handling.py
JOURNEY_TYPE = 'TreasureHuntingJourney'
REQUEST_TYPE = 'JourneyMarkRequest'
MARK_TYPE = 'JourneyMark'
CHARTER_TYPE = 'JourneyCharter'</code> 



<p>Technically you could hardcode the schema prefixes into your code since once you standardize on a specific set of ACDC schemas and they are in production then you won’t be changing them especially since you must support backwards compatibility likely indefinitely for whatever schemas you release to production. Yet, even with this technical possibility, I prefer to use schema type names so I wrote a a resolver function to resolve a schema.</p>



 Communicator init function 



<p>You can see in the init function I made a dict for schema handlers and another dict for payload handlers that maps the type names above to specific functions.</p>


 
 


<p>I then use two resolver functions, type to SAID and SAID to type, to pair up schema SAIDs from incoming presentations to the configured SAIDs from the schema SAID mapping file we wrote earlier:</p>



 <code>def resolve_said_to_type(self, schema_said):
    for mapping in self.mappings:
        if mapping.said == schema_said:
            return mapping.credential_type
    raise kering.ValidationError(f"no mapping found for schema {schema_said}")

def resolve_type_to_said(self, credential_type):
    for mapping in self.mappings:
        if mapping.credential_type == credential_type:
            return mapping.said
    raise kering.ValidationError(f"no mapping found for schema {credential_type}")</code> 



<p>If no mapping is found for a given type then a ValidationError is raised.</p>



 Schema Validator Function Selection and Invocation 



<p>After resolving the schema type for an incoming credential then a handler is selected from the configured SAID mapping file as shown <a href="https://github.com/kentbull/sally/blob/dev/src/sally/core/handling.py#L185">on line 185</a> in order to select and then invoke a credential validator:</p>


 
 


 Payload Handler Function Selection and Invocation 



<p>After selecting the validator, and assuming the credential passes validation, a response payload handler is selected <a href="https://github.com/kentbull/sally/blob/dev/src/sally/core/handling.py#L246">on line 246</a> and then invoked.</p>


 
 


<p>Again, if no schema validator or handler is found an exception is raised. Otherwise the correct handler is selected to validate the schema and then the correct payload handler prepares the response to the presentation event.</p>



<p>Both of the following functions are the most complicated versions of their functions in Abydos Gatekeeper. You can read through the other similar functions if you want more illustrations.</p>



 JourneyCharter schema validator 



<p>As you can see in the <code><a href="https://github.com/kentbull/sally/blob/dev/src/sally/core/handling.py#LL414C12-L414C12">validateJourneyCharter</a></code> function first the ACDC schema SAID is validated, the credential issuer is verified, and then the credential is handed to other validation functions to validate the full credential chain. Refer to the code for a complete understanding of what it means to validate the full credential chain.</p>


 
 


 JourneyCharter payload handler 



<p>In response to a credential presentation the custom controller can return a customized object which. in this case is the data dict beginning at line 511. What makes this payload function more interesting is the use of the registry (reger) object to retrieve data from each of the credentials chained to the JourneyCharter credential.</p>


 
 


<p>With all of this setup complete we are ready to set up the webhook.</p>



 Webhook Setup 



<p>The webhook only starts up a HTTP server on the default port of 9923. You start it up with the following:</p>



 <code>$ sally hook demo

# Should provide output like the following:
launching on port 9923
Sally Web Hook Sample listening on 9923</code> 



<p>Once the webhook is listening then you are ready to make a presentation and receive a response from the controller.</p>



 Present JourneyCharter Credential – KLI 



<p>Making a presentation request requires knowing the SAID of the credential you want to present as well as the alias of the recipient you want to send the presentation to. This alias must match up the OOBI alias name you used earlier when resolving an OOBI to connect the presenting controller to the target controller the presentation is being sent to.</p>



 <code># First we get the SAID of the JourneyCharter credential for Richard
RICHARD_CRED_SAID=$(kli vc list --name ${EXPLORER_KEYSTORE} \
  --alias ${EXPLORER_ALIAS} \
  --said \
  --schema ${JOURNEY_CHARTER_SCHEMA_SAID})

# Then we present the credential to the Gatekeeper
kli vc present --name ${EXPLORER_KEYSTORE} \
  --alias ${EXPLORER_ALIAS} \
  --said "${RICHARD_CRED_SAID}" \
  --recipient ${GATEKEEPER_ALIAS} \
  --include</code> 



<p>The <code>--include</code> option instructs the KLI to send all of the ACDC data in the presentation and is critical in order for the request to work.</p>



<p>Once the presentation is sent you will need to wait a few moments for the target controller to receive the credential, validate it, and then send the response payload to the webhook.</p>



 Webhook Response 



<p>All the webhook does is return a dump of the HTTP headers and the HTTP request body. For example, the Gatekeeper’s response to Richard’s presentation of the JourneyCharter credential looks like the following, and Elayne’s is very similar:</p>

 Present JourneyCharter Credential – Agent (Mark I – deprecated) 



<p>Presenting with the agent is very similar to with the KLI. You must know the recipient alias, corresponding to the “oobialias” property used to register an OOBI earlier, you must know the ACDC schema SAID, as well as the SAID of the credential you want to present.</p>



 <code>EXPLORER_CHARTER_CRED_SAID=$(curl -s \
  -X GET "${EXPLORER_AGENT_URL}/credentials/${EXPLORER_ALIAS}?type=received&amp;schema=${JOURNEY_CHARTER_SCHEMA_SAID}" \
  | jq '.[0] | .sad.d' | tr -d '"')

curl -s \
  -X POST "${EXPLORER_AGENT_URL}/credentials/${EXPLORER_ALIAS}/presentations" \
  -H 'accept: */*' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{
        \"recipient\": \"${GATEKEEPER_ALIAS}\",
        \"said\": \"${EXPLORER_CHARTER_CRED_SAID}\",
        \"schema\": \"${JOURNEY_CHARTER_SCHEMA_SAID}\",
        \"include\": true
      }"</code> 



<p>Once again the <code>"include": true</code> property is essential to instruct the agent to send all of the ACDC data for the JourneyMark credential and all linked credentials to the recipient controller, the Abydos Gatekeeper.</p>



 Credential Revocation 



<p>Revocation is an essential part of the lifecycle of an ACDC-style credential. A credential may be revoked at any time. This is represented as a “rev” action in the TEL for that ACDC and can be included in either an “ixn” (Interaction) or “rot” (Rotation) event in the controller’s KEL.</p>



 Revoke JourneyCharter Credential – KLI 



<p>Revoking a credential is very simple. Starting with the SAID of the credential to be revoked the below example stores it in the BASH variable <code>RICHARD_JOURNEY_CHARTER_CRED_SAID</code> which Iis then fed into the <code>kli vc revoke</code> command. </p>



 <code>RICHARD_JOURNEY_CHARTER_CRED_SAID=$(kli vc list \
  --name ${EXPLORER_KEYSTORE} \
  --alias ${EXPLORER_ALIAS} \
  --said \
  --schema ${JOURNEY_CHARTER_SCHEMA_SAID})

kli vc revoke --name ${WISEMAN_KEYSTORE} \
  --alias ${WISEMAN_ALIAS} \
  --registry-name ${WISEMAN_REGISTRY} \
  --said "${RICHARD_JOURNEY_CHARTER_CRED_SAID}" \
  --send ${GATEKEEPER_ALIAS}</code> 



<p>Then when this credential is presented again later the Gatekeeper will see that the credential has been revoked. </p>



<p>The <code>--send</code> argument is essential to instruct the issuing controller to send the revocation notice to the target controller, in this case the Gatekeeper. </p>



 Webhook revocation notification 



<p>With the revocation information the Gatekeeper adjusts its internal state for that credential and then triggers the webhook with a revocation payload. The output from the webhook looks like the following:</p>



 <code>Gatekeeper | received request
Gatekeeper | Invalid credential. Revoked on: 2023-03-29T15:17:19.394845+00:00

 Presenting a Revoked Credential 



<p>When you try to present the credential again to the Gatekeeper the revocation status is detected.</p>



 <code>kli vc present --name explorer --alias richard \
  --said ${RICHARD_JOURNEY_CHARTER_CRED_SAID} \
  --recipient zaqiel \
  --include</code> 



<p>Yet the Gatekeeper detects the revoked status:</p>



 <code>revoked credential EIdNBtudTLx3g-WWIYmuvzkUmVnXgT3EdaUC-3JbeAv1 being presented
# ...continues on to send revoked credential to the webhook</code> 



<p>The one thing missing from the Abydos Gatekeeper for this revocation flow is to send a different payload to the webhook when a revoked credential is presented. This topic will be explored in a future blog post.</p>



<p>With that complete we move on to the bonus section on revocation with the Mark I agent.</p>



 Bonus – Revoke JourneyCharter Credential – Agent (Mark I – deprecated) 



<p>A simple revocation is possible with the Mark I Agent yet it is missing functionality similar to the <code>--send</code> argument to <code>kli vc revoke</code> and thus should not be used. It is included here as an illustration of how revocation with an agent may work.</p>



 <code>curl -s \
  -X DELETE "${WISEMAN_AGENT}/credentials/${WISEMAN_ALIAS}?registry=${WISEMAN_REGISTRY}&amp;said=${EXPLORER_JOURNEY_CHARTER_CRED_SAID}" \
  --header 'accept: */*' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json'</code> 



<p>The response is an HTTP 202 Accepted and a blank response body.</p>



 Congratulate yourself! 



<p>Your little network is now readys to send our dear treasure hunters on their journey to the Osireion at Abydos! They, and ATHENA, will be very pleased with you and your work. Maybe you will even get a cut of the treasure.</p>

I assume you're familiar with these terms in this post. If you're not there's a great explanation in chapter 12 of my new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1098117697/technometria-20">Learning Digital Identity</a>.1</p>   <p>Thanks for reading Phil Windley's Technometria! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.</p>       <p>To explore access management patterns, let's classify applications requiring fine-grained access management into one of two types:</p>  <p>Structured—these applications can use the structure of the attribute information to simplify access management. For example, an HR application might express a policy as “all L9 managers with more than 10 reports can access compensation management functionality for their reports”. The structure allows attributes like <code>level</code> and <code>number_of_reports</code> to be used to manage access to the compensation tool with a single policy. A smalls set of policies can control access to the compensation tool. These applications are the sweet spot for ABAC.</p>  <p>Ad hoc—these applications allow users to manage access to resources they control based on identifiers for both principals and resources without any underlying structure. For example, Alice shares her vacation photo album with Betty and Charlie. The photo album, Betty, and Charlie have no attributes in common that can be used to write a single attribute-based policy defining access. These applications have a harder time making effective use of ABAC.</p>  <p>Ad hoc access management is more difficult than structured because of the combinatorial explosion of possible access relationships. When any principal can share any resource they control with any other principal and with any subset of possible actions, the number of combinations quickly becomes very large.</p><p>There are several approaches we can take to ad hoc access management:</p>  <p>Policy-based—In this approach the application writes a new policy for every access case. In the example given above, when Alice shares her vacation photo album with Betty and Charlie, the application would create a policy that explicitly permits Betty and Charlie to access Alice’s vacation photo album. Every change in access would result in a new policy or the modification of an existing one. This is essentially using policies as ACLs.</p>  <p>Group-based—In a group-based approach, we create a group for people who can access the vacation photo album and a policy that allows access to the vacation photo album if the user has a group attribute of <code>canAccessVacationPhotos</code>. The group name has to be unique to Alice's vacation photo album and includes the allowed action. When Alice shares the album with Betty and Charlie, we add them both to the <code>canAccessVacationPhotos</code> group by putting it in the <code>groups</code>attribute in their profile. Group-based policies look like "principal <code>P</code> can access <code>vacationPhotosAlbum</code> if <code>P.groups contains canAccessVacationPhotos</code>." This is essentually RBAC.</p>  <p>Resource-based—In this approach, we add a <code>sharedWith</code> or <code>canEdit</code> attribute to Alice’s vacation photos album that records the principals who can access the resource. Now our policy uses the resource attribute to allow access to anyone in that list. Resource-based policies look like "principal <code>P</code> can edit resource <code>R</code> if <code>P </code>is in <code>R.canEdit</code>". Every resource of the same type has the same attributes. This approach is close to ABAC because it makes use of attributes on the resources to manage access, reducing the combinatorial explosion.</p>  <p>Hybrid—We can combine group and resource-based access management by creating groups of users and storing group names in resource attribute instead of principals. For example, if Alice adds Betty and Charlie to her group <code>friends</code>, then she could add <code>friends</code> to the <code>sharedWith</code> attribute on her album. The advantage of the hybrid approach is we reduce the length of the attribute lists.</p>  <p>The advantage of the policy-based approach is that it’s the <a href="http://c2.com/xp/DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">simplest thing that could possibly work</a>. Given a policy store with sufficient management features (i.e., finding, filtering, creating, modifying, and deleting policies) this is straight-forward. The chief downside is the explosion in the number of policies and the scaling that it requires of the policy store. Also since the user’s permissions are scattered among many different policies, knowing who can do what is difficult and relies on the policy store's filtering capabilities.</p><p>The group-based approach results in a large number of groups for very specific purposes. This is a common problem with RBAC systems. But given an attribute store (like an IdM profile) that scales well, it splits the work between the attribute and policy stores by reducing the number of policies to one per share type (or combination). That is, we need a policy for each resource that allows viewing, one to allow editing, and so on. </p><p>The resource-base approach reduces the explosion of groups by attaching attributes to the resource, imposing structure. In the photo album sharing example, each album (and photo) would need an attribute for each sharing type (view, modify, delete). If Alice says Betty can view and modify an album, Betty’s identifier would be added to the view and modify attributes for that album. We need a policy for each unique resource type and action.</p><p>The downside of the resource-based approach is that the access management system has to be able to use resource attributes in the authorization context. Integrating the access management system with an IdP provides attributes about principals so that we can automatically make those attributes available in the authorization context. You could integrate using the attributes in an <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OIDC</a> token or by syncing the authorization service with the IdP using <a href="https://www.okta.com/blog/2017/01/what-is-scim/">SCIM</a>.</p><p>But the ways that attributes can be attached to a resource are varied. For example, they might be stored in the application's database. They might be part of an inventory control system. And so on. So the access management system must allow developers to inject those attributes into the authorization context when the policy enforcement point is queried or have a sufficiently flexible policy information point to easily integrate it with different databases and APIs. Commercial ABAC systems will have solved this problem because it is core to how they function.</p><p>Every application, of course, will make architectural decisions about access management based its specific needs. But if you understand the patterns that are available to you, then you can think through the ramifications of your design ahead of time. Sometimes this is lost in the myth that policy-based access management (PBAC) is all the same. All of the approaches I list above are PBAC, but they're not all ABAC.</p>    Notes   <p>The material that follows is not in the book. But it should be. An errata, perhaps.</p>     <p>Thanks for reading Phil Windley's Technometria! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.</p>

<p>The challenge, to come up with language that describes the value that is enabled through the technical standards that comprise what is known as IDTech (also known as Self-Sovereign Identity or the Decentralized Identity stack).&nbsp; This is independent of the different variations within the technology stack, and more importantly is meant for the vast majority of the business? population that have never heard of different standards bodies, protocols or tech stacks, and who quite frankly don’t care and will never exert the effort to learn about them.&nbsp; In many cases these are the exact people who make the final investment go/no-go decision.</p><p>After hundreds of conversations and countless hours of research and reading over the past five years, four ‘qualities of value’ have emerged.&nbsp; These are provenance, persistence, flexibility, and portability.&nbsp;&nbsp; If these values are important in your business or operations, then this technology sector will be important for you.</p><p>Provenance, the ability to trace where something, whether data or physical object, has come from, and to have confidence the data has not been tampered with.&nbsp;&nbsp; More than just that, it is being able to trace back to the source with the highest level of confidence.&nbsp; This means to be able to automatically (no human intervention) determine what entity issued or attested to the data or physical object and to validate that this party is authorized to make these claims.&nbsp; </p><p>Persistence, the ability to act on data and information whether the original source of the data continues to exist or not.&nbsp; A reality of life is constant change.&nbsp; For anyone interacting with technology, the rate of change seems only to go up.&nbsp; With change, older systems become unavailable, but information links may need to persist far beyond the life of the source system.&nbsp; Having a mechanism that provides high levels of assurance on the information integrity under the control of the interested entity define / rephrase? can mean a decoupling of systems, reducing complexity and increasing resilience.</p><p>Flexibility, the ability to use the data about an object in ways that extend beyond the original intended use of the data.&nbsp; The most common example of a document that is used widely outside its intended use is the driver’s license, which is also used as a piece of identity documentation for purchasing age restricted products, writing a check (in the US), checking into a hotel and many other uses that have nothing to do with driving a vehicle.&nbsp; This is a broad but simplistic use case. When an individual or organization has the ability to select data from various parties and combine these into a single new claim, presenting this composite claim to any entity while retaining the highest levels of provenance outlined above, this creates new business models and revenue opportunities are found.</p><p>Portability, the ability to bring the data “with me”, and to do so in a manner that does not leave a link or connection to the issuer of the data.&nbsp; This is the ability to move this information between systems and vendors.&nbsp; As an individual or business, data portability is of value as a means to prevent capture or lock-in to a specific vendor.&nbsp; Additionally, being able to use the data in a manner that does not leave a ‘bread crumb trail’ every time it is used (or shared) is critical for personal privacy as well as business confidentiality, and has become a requirement under the law with the GDPR and CCPA regulations. </p><p>In this first post, I have intentionally kept the concepts at a high level.&nbsp; In the following posts, I will delve further into each of these Values, expanding on them and bringing in examples of where they would apply.&nbsp; I will endeavor to keep technical language and jargon out of the posts where at all possible.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;</p>

  In Mapping the wider fediverse I showed how a new table added to the Mastodon plugin — mastodon_domain_block — enables queries that find which servers are moderating which other servers. For example, here are servers on nerdculture.de‘s list of offenders. select server, domain, severity from mastodon_domain_block where server = 'https://nerdculture.de' +------------------------+--------------------

In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2023/02/02/mapping-the-wider-fediverse/">Mapping the wider fediverse</a> I showed how a new table added to the <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-mastodon">Mastodon plugin</a> — mastodon_domain_block — enables queries that find which servers are moderating which other servers. For example, here are servers on <a href="https://nerdculture.de">nerdculture.de</a>‘s list of offenders.</p>

I used the new query pattern to build a <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-mastodon-insights">dashboard</a> to report, for each server in the home timeline:</p>
 
 The list of blocking servers.
  The count of blocked servers for each blocking server.
  The list of blocking servers for each blocked server, and the count of those blocking servers.
  
<p>
This was a good start, but I had a hunch that <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2023/01/16/mastodon-relationship-graphs/">relationship graphs</a> would reveal non-obvious connections among these servers. And indeed they do! Here’s a view of the new graph-enriched dashboard.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/blocked-and-blocking.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>
The left pane shows the blocked servers shunned by a blocking server selected from those in the home timeline. The right pane has the inverse view: the blocking servers that shun a selected blocked server. These were the two categories I defined for the first iteration of these graphs.</p>
 category "blocking_server" {
  color = "darkgreen"
  icon = "server"
}

category "blocked_server" {
  color = "darkred"
  icon = "server"
}
 
<p>
Here’s the code for one of the graphs.</p>
 graph {
   node {
    base = node.blocking_server
  }
   node {
    base = node.blocked_server
  }
   node {
    base = node.blocked_and_blocking_server
  }
   edge {
    args = [ self.input.blocking_server.value ]
    base = edge.match_blocked_server
  }
   edge {
    args = [ self.input.blocking_server.value ]
    base = edge.match_blocking_server
  }
}
 
<p>
Here is the definition of node.blocking_server, which refers to category.blocking_server.</p>
 node "blocking_server" {
  category = category.blocking_server
  sql = &lt;&lt;EOQ
    with servers as (
      select distinct
        blocking_server,
        blocked_server
      from
        blocking_servers(${local.limit})
    )
    select
      blocking_server as id,
      blocking_server as title
    from
      servers
    order by
      blocking_server
  EOQ
}
 
<p>
The FROM clause calls blocking_servers(), a <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/08/21/postgres-functional-style/">set-returning function</a> defined like so.</p>
 create or replace function public.blocking_servers(max int) returns table (
  blocking_server text,
  blocked_server text
) as $$
with servers as (
  select distinct
    server as domain,
    'https://' || server as server_url
  from
    mastodon_toot
  where
    timeline = 'home'
  limit max
),
blocking_and_blocked as (
  select
    s.domain as blocking_domain,
    d.domain as blocked_domain
  from
    servers s
  join
    mastodon_domain_block d
  on
    s.server_url = d.server
)
select
  blocking_domain,
  blocked_domain
from
  blocking_and_blocked
order by
  blocking_domain, blocked_domain
$$ language sql
 
<p>I thought these ingredients would suffice. But when I began poking around in the graphs made with these definitions, infosec.exchange behaved strangely. Someties it would appear as a blocking server, other times as a blocked server. I was missing a category!</p>
 category "blocked_and_blocking_server" {
  color = "orange"
  icon = "server"
}
 
<p>
As you can see in the graph, infosec.exchange not only blocks 73 servers, it is also blocked by two servers: religion.masto.host and weatherishappening.net. Why?</p>
<p>
<a href="https://weatherishappening.net/about">weatherishappening.net</a> calls infosec.exchange a “HOSTING DEATH SPIRAL FASCIST ORGANIZATION” and blocks it with “Limited” severity.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://religion.masto.host/about">religion.masto.host</a> blocks infosec.exchange at the “Suspended” level, but does not explain why (“Reason not available”).</p>
<p>
Although those servers could, in turn, be blocked by others, no such blocks appear in the block lists of my immediate server neighborhood.</p>
 &gt; select count(*) from blocking_servers(100) where blocked_server = 'weatherishappening.net'
+-------+
| count |
+-------+
| 0     |
+-------+

&gt; select count(*) from blocking_servers(100) where blocked_server = 'religion.masto.host'
+-------+
| count |
+-------+
| 0     |
+-------+
 
<p>
There is another switch hitter in my neighborhood, though. <a href="https://c.im">c.im</a> is blocked by <a>me.dm</a> and <a href="https://octodon.social">octodon.social</a>.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/blocked-and-blocking2.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>
Why?</p>
<p>
me.dm (Medium) has “Suspended” c.im for “Hate speech”.</p>
<p>
octodon.social has “Suspended” c.im for “Reason not available”.</p>
<p>
When the opinions and policies of your server differ from those of mine, we see different realities through our respective lenses. Could such fragmentation drive the fediverse-curious back into arms of Big Social? I’m sure that will happen — indeed is happening — to some degree.</p>
<p>
But I hope that some of us, at least, will learn to thrive in diverse networks of online communities, aware of the kaleidoscopic interplay of filters but not overwhelmed by it. That skill  will serve us well IRL too. To acquire it, we’ll need to visualize the operation of our filters. One great way to do that: SQL queries that drive relationship graphs.</p>

Either they struggled to launch their product, or failed to drive adoption of their product once in market. However, a handful of others show early signs of promising success.</p><p>So I thought I’d document the differences I’ve seen between the fizzles and the sizzles. Spoiler alert: the single biggest predictor of success is simply product execution. It’s the simple stuff like knowing the problem you’re solving, building a good product to solve it, and capturing value with a sustainable business model. Building an IDtech product is hard — the tactics below are ones that I’ve seen used to improve the odds of success for a myriad of IDtech products.</p><blockquote>If you’re interested in diving into more tactical insights from successes and failures from IDtech builders themselves, check out our&nbsp;<a href="http://trinsic.id/podcast">podcast</a>!</blockquote> Common Product Form&nbsp;Factors <p>Most successful IDtech companies you’ll find have similarities in terms of the products they’re developing. These similarities tend to bridge technical approaches (e.g. built using web2 vs web3), industries, and use&nbsp;cases.</p>  End-user app (product for Holder)<br>Usually, IDtech products are built for people — and those people need a way to manage their identity and consent to data being shared. But some IDtech products target organizations or IoT devices, too (collectively, the “end-user”). This is often called a “Wallet App” or an “ID Wallet”. Decisions about these products, such as whether a mobile app or web app will be developed, depend heavily on the use&nbsp;case.  Identity wallet apps can vary greatly in user experience depending on its intended end user and purpose. Above are three examples of identity wallets from three IDtech companies: ZADA, Dentity, and Yoma (from left to right). Although shown on mobile devices, wallets can bridge mobile, web, browser, and&nbsp;more.  Ecosystem tools (product(s) for Issuers/Verifiers)<br>Creating an ecosystem around the end-user is vital to the success of any IDtech company. After all, an ID wallet is only useful if there is somewhere to use it. Some IDtech companies offer a free end-user product and charge the rest of the ecosystem for the tools to interact with those users, making these ecosystem tools the primary revenue model. We’ve seen various kinds of ecosystem tools successfully generate revenue, such as dashboards, workflow builders, verification landing pages (e.g. for things like OIDC or offline verification), curation &amp; governance services, APIs for integrating solutions into existing systems, and&nbsp;more.  Industry- or use case-specific integrations<br>Many successful IDtech companies begin by targeting a specific industry or use case. The more targeted the vertical, the easier it is to integrate with existing systems and get initial users. For example, an IDtech product for Realtors in the USA can build native integrations with state licensing databases, continuing education (CE) programs, and MLS systems alongside the Realtor’s credentials, offering a much more tailored experience than a generic wallet app ever&nbsp;could.  Provider is the term we at Trinsic use to describe the provider of an IDtech solution/product, which they then offer to an ecosystem of organizations and&nbsp;people. Success Patterns in&nbsp;IDtech <p>While I don’t claim to have a surefire recipe for IDtech product success, I’ve identified several patterns exhibited by successful companies that I hope will prove useful to&nbsp;others.</p> Concise, straightforward messaging <p>Once, I sat down with a venture capitalist to talk about Trinsic (then called Streetcred ID). Midway through the pitch he said, “This sounds like something that could leverage blockchain. Have you looked into that?” to which I responded “Yes, our solution uses a blockchain called Sovrin for anchoring identifiers of issuers.” He looked stunned. “Did you just pitch me a blockchain company without using the word blockchain in the first few minutes?” he asked. Of course, the answer was yes, and Kickstart ended up <a href="https://trinsic.id/streetcred-id-rebrands-to-trinsic-raises-pre-seed-funding/">investing</a>.</p><p>Even more so than investors, customers care about how you can solve their problem, not about the technology you’re using. And when conveying this value, it’s important to do it clearly (without buzzwords or jargon) and concisely. This messaging will look differently for each IDtech product, but here’s a framework I’ve found&nbsp;helpful:</p><p>“_____ enables ______ to use ______ to _________”</p><p>Let’s apply this to a super-successful IDtech company called <a href="https://classpass.com/">Classpass</a>. What do they do for consumers? “Classpassenables people to use a single subscription to access exercise classes all over their city”. What do they do for businesses? “Classpass enables gyms to use a simple integration into their existing booking system to earn additional revenue from the classes they’re already doing.” IDtech companies built using decentralized identity don’t need to be more complicated; take <a href="https://zada.io/">ZADA</a> for example, who has tens of thousands of active users in Southeast Asia. “ZADA enables people to use their health credentials to travel seamlessly in a post-covid world.”</p><p>Teams that nail the messaging of their IDtech solution tend to see better results and get faster adoption. If you have another framework to explain an IDtech product concisely, let me&nbsp;know!</p> Decentralized Identity Leads to Great IDtech&nbsp;Products <p>Despite IDtech products existing for some time, new-age IDtech products inspired by the concept of self-sovereign identity (SSI) are springing up faster than ever to fill gaps that are challenging to fill using the technologies of previous&nbsp;decades.</p><p>While I don’t believe SSI is necessary for IDtech, I do think IDtech products built using SSI/web5 technology have a competitive edge. As I explain in a <a href="https://medium.com/trinsic/blockchain-is-the-least-interesting-thing-about-self-sovereign-identity-75c1b56ce497#5275">previous post</a>, IDtechs built using interoperable technologies give users more choice and usability of their identity earlier (because of the growth of other IDtechs), creating a virtuous cycle with a higher likelihood of customer satisfaction. Not to mention you get a lot out of the box using an infrastructure platform like&nbsp;Trinsic.</p><p>That said, empirically we are seeing proprietary IDtech companies growing much faster than ones based on standardized, interoperable solutions. I think that’s because many of the people building with interoperable solutions are spending far too much time in working group meetings debating governance frameworks or building their own decentralized fairy-tale solution from the ground-up. If SSI stands a chance, the community needs to focus on customers and&nbsp;product.</p> Focus on Your Core Competency <p>This advice isn’t new, but it’s easy to forget. A brief reading of any startup or innovation best practice will tell you to <a href="https://fictivekin.github.io/pmarchive-jekyll//guide_to_startups_part4">focus obsessively on product/market fit</a>, or only do that which makes your “<a href="https://podup.substack.com/p/jeff-bezoss-beer-tasting-analogy">beer taste better</a>”. It’s common sense that 99% of businesses should use AWS instead of buying their own servers, for example. IDtech companies are no different.</p><p>Because most IDtech companies face a <a href="https://a16z.com/book/the-cold-start-problem/">cold start problem</a> as they’re rolling out their solution, it’s critical that as many resources as possible focus on solving that problem. As teams learn about their market, they inevitably need to iterate on their product. If these iterations require refactoring of infrastructure in addition to application changes, the speed of iteration can slow to a snail’s&nbsp;pace.</p><p>Trinsic offers infrastructure for building IDtech products using digital wallets and verifiable credentials. A variety of companies offer infrastructure for identity proofing using government IDs &amp; a selfie. Other companies offer infrastructure for user directories, access management, and login. Savvy teams make wise decisions about the infrastructure they leverage to build their IDtech products upon so they can move fast in solving the most important problems to their business instead of reinventing the&nbsp;wheel.</p> Business Model Shouldn’t Be on the Back&nbsp;Burner <p>For most product teams, it goes without saying that great product execution is a key to success. In some industries, the business model is relatively straightforward (e.g., in SaaS productivity software, most companies charge ~$10/user/month). But because IDtech is still emerging as a category, oftentimes the business model is just as make-or-break as the&nbsp;product.</p><p>We’ve identified several viable business models for IDtech companies — stay tuned for more on that. For now, remember that business model innovation is as important as technology innovation in the world of&nbsp;IDtech.</p> Give Your Product a&nbsp;Name <p>Many IDtech products are given a distinct name to make it more concrete in the eyes of end-users. For example, TravelPass is the name of a product developed by IATA to verify vaccine status of passengers — that’s 10x better than saying “get your digital travel wallet app so you can download your vaccine data” and 100x better than saying “download a self-sovereign agent so you can custody your own verifiable credential containing a cryptographically-signed vaccine attestation.”</p><p>Products like MemberPass, MySudo, MedCreds, FarmerID, and many more use their name to solidify their market positioning to end-users and get adoption&nbsp;faster.</p> Conclusion <p>Building an IDtech product is hard. Acquiring users and driving adoption is harder. Despite this, my optimism for the future of IDtech has never been stronger. IDtech infrastructure companies like <a href="http://trinsic.id/">Trinsic</a> are making it easier than ever to build an IDtech company. IDtech companies are getting better at marketing their products. And more IDtech products are getting adopted, leaving behind a blueprint of what it takes to be successful in such a complicated space as identity.</p><blockquote>For more tactical insights from IDtech builders, remember to check out the Future of Identity&nbsp;<a href="http://trinsic.id/podcast">podcast</a>!</blockquote><p>We’re all still learning about what makes great IDtech products.

<p>I recently got access to the <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/">BlueSky</a> beta, and decided to poke around to see what it's all about. I will save the details of what it is and how I feel about it for a different post. However, one of the first things you do when you sign up is choose a username that exists under the <code>bsky.app</code> domain. I have zero interest in another name rush where everyone tries to claim the shortest username possible, so I went with <code>aaronpk.bsky.app</code> rather than trying to get <code>a</code> or <code>apk</code>.</p>

<p>But, as I was poking around the app and replying to a few people, it just didn't feel like "me" yet. I don't care about renting a name in someone else's space. Yesterday, Jay Graber posted on the BlueSky blog all about supporting <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/3-6-2023-domain-names-as-handles-in-bluesky">custom domains as identities in BlueSky</a>. Naturally I was curious to try this out myself, but there were no technical details available in the blog post.</p>

<p>When I opened my BlueSky timeline, I saw a few people mentioning that they had figured out how to do it even before the app supported it natively. I did some digging around, and <a href="https://jik.wtf/">jik</a> pointed me to the right places in the AT Proto docs, and I was able to change my handle to <code>aaronpk.com</code>!</p>

<p>Below are the instructions for how to do this yourself. Please note that these instructions will be made obsolete in a week or two since the BlueSky developers are planning on shipping first class support for custom domains in the app and you won't need to do this workaround for long.</p>

 Overview 

<p>The rough process for this is:</p>

 
 Create a DNS TXT record on your domain with the value of your underlying BlueSky ID 
 Get a token for your account (e.g. "log in" to your account from an HTTP client) 
 Update your profile with your new domain 
 

<p>Note: To make these POST requests, you'll need an HTTP client that can POST in JSON format. You can use cURL, httpie, Postman, or write code in whatever language you want. I'll use <a href="https://httpie.io/">httpie</a> for the examples.</p>

 Get a token for your account 

<p>First, you need to "log in" to your account. This process will return an access token you can use to update your profile. Logging in will also tell you your DID, the unique identifier for your underlying account. (The "handle" on your account is more like a display name, and that's how your account can end up being portable across domains as well as BlueSky servers later.)</p>

<p>Call the <a href="https://atproto.com/lexicons/com-atproto-session">com.atproto.session</a> method with your email and password you used to sign up. (Type this all on one line, I've just split it into multiple lines for readability. Also, again, if you're using cURL or another HTTP client, make sure you send this payload as JSON, not form-encoded.)</p>

 <code>http post https://bsky.social/xrpc/com.atproto.session.create 
            handle=user@example.com password=hunter2
</code> 

<p>The response will be a JSON document with your access token as well as DID:</p>

 <code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 609
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Date: Tue, 07 Mar 2023 15:29:38 GMT
ETag: W/"261-15oNf47+gL0kDnvlsvzpUK0ocx8"
X-Powered-By: Express

{
    "accessJwt": "eyJh...",
    "did": "did:plc:s2koow7r6t7tozgd4slc3dsg",
    "handle": "aaronpk.bsky.app",
    "refreshJwt": "eyJh..."
}
</code> 

 Create a DNS Record 

<p>Go to your domain registrar and create a new TXT record on your domain.</p>

 
 Subdomain: <code>_atproto</code> 
 Value: <code>did=did:plc:XXXXXXXXX</code> 
 TTL: Default 
 

<p>In my case, the domain I wanted to use is <code>aaronpk.com</code>, so I would create a new subdomain <code>_atproto.aaronpk.com</code>, with the value <code>did=did:plc:s2koow7r6t7tozgd4slc3dsg</code>.</p>

 <code>_atproto.aaronpk.com TXT did=did:plc:s2koow7r6t7tozgd4slc3dsg
</code> 

 Update your Profile 

<p>Wait a little while to make sure the DNS entry takes effect. Then you can update your profile with your new domain by running the <a href="https://bsky.social/xrpc/com.atproto.handle.update">com.atproto.handle.update</a> method.</p>

<p>Use the value of the <code>accessJwt</code> you got from the first request. (Again, type this out all on one line.)</p>

 <code>http post https://bsky.social/xrpc/com.atproto.handle.update 
      Authorization:"Bearer eyJ..." 
      handle=aaronpk.com 
</code> 

<p>You won't see a response, but that means it worked! Next time you open the app, you'll probably see a bunch of errors. So log out of the app, and log back in! Right now, you'll need to use your email address to log in instead of your handle, but they are going to fix that in a future update.</p>

<p>Now you should see your new domain as your handle in the BlueSky app!</p>

<p></p>

<p>Once again, this will all be obsolete once they ship this feature in the app itself! Here's a sneak peek from Paul of what the interface will look like!</p>

<p>Verifiable Credentials for Enhanced Supply Chain Traceability, Security, &amp; Resilience</p><p>Transmute uses verifiable credentials (VCs) + decentralized identifiers (DIDs) to create cost effective supply chain data security at scale. Using VCs + DIDs together harnesses the benefits of centralization while eliminating the downsides.</p> The Drawbacks of Blockchain <p>Blockchains are an incredible innovation, but they’re not a one-size-fits-all solution.</p><p>In their current state, blockchains are a heavy and over-engineered tool for the job at hand when it comes to bridging data silos in global&nbsp;trade.</p> Blockchains have a high cost for creation and maintenance.   Blockchains are expensive in public and private form, often gobbling up the margins of commodities they are being used to&nbsp;secure.   Blockchains are difficult to&nbsp;scale.   Blockchains don’t scale well enough for reliable enterprise use, including large supply chain companies or large regulatory and customs agencies. Blockchains may require layer 2 solutions to meet these&nbsp;needs.   Blockchains lack interoperability.   Blockchains aren’t interoperable with existing infrastructure or each other. To achieve interoperability, blockchains require additional adapters or layer 2 investments. Additionally, the cryptography many of them rely on is still considered very emergent and may not meet certain regulatory requirements. For instance, <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-186.pdf">updated NIST requirements</a> only recently allowed for an element used in Bitcoin and Ethereum to be used in blockchain applications.   The Benefits of VCs +&nbsp;DIDs <p>Applied correctly, VCs + DIDs are affordable, interoperable, and already standardized. The interoperability perks of VCs + DIDs give you the ability to work across existing systems, including distributed ledgers (DLTs) and blockchains. Using VCs + DIDs is a futureproof method to fortify supply chain data, using the right tool for the&nbsp;job.</p>  Using VCs + the appropriate DIDs provide the security benefits of decentralization and the efficiency benefits of centralization. Decentralization benefits include immutable claims and tamper evidence, while centralization benefits include scalability.  Implemented by experts like Transmute, VCs + DIDs awaken superpowers — such as data portability, data minimization, and selective disclosure — without locking you into a single vendor or blockchain.  <p><a href="https://medium.com/@karylfowler">Karyl Fowler</a>, Transmute co-Founder and CEO, is an expert in emerging tech and economic development in fields with high regulatory burdens such as FDA, HIPAA and ITAR.

<p>This article shows how an ASP.NET Core Razor Page application could implement an automatic sign-out when a user does not use the application for n-minutes. The application is secured using Azure AD B2C. To remove the session, the client must sign-out both on the ASP.NET Core application and the Azure AD B2C identity provider or whatever identity provider you are using.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCoreB2cLogout">https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCoreB2cLogout</a></p>



<p>Sometimes clients require that an application supports automatic sign-out in a SSO environment. An example of this is when a user uses a shared computer and does not click the sign-out button. The session would remain active for the next user. This method is not fool proof as the end user could save the credentials in the browser. If you need a better solution, then SSO and rolling sessions should be avoided but this leads to a worse user experience.</p>



<p></p>



<p>The ASP.NET Core application is protected using <a href="https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-identity-web">Microsoft.Identity.Web</a>. This takes care of the client authentication flows using Azure AD B2C as the identity provider. Once authenticated, the session is stored in a cookie. A distributed cache is added to record the last activity of of each user. An IAsyncPageFilter implementation is used and added as a global filter to all requests for Razor Pages. The SessionTimeoutAsyncPageFilter class implements the IAsyncPageFilter interface.</p>


  builder.Services.AddDistributedMemoryCache();

builder.Services.AddAuthentication(OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
	.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApp(builder.Configuration, "AzureAdB2c" )
	.EnableTokenAcquisitionToCallDownstreamApi(Array.Empty&lt;string&gt;())
	.AddDistributedTokenCaches();

builder.Services.AddAuthorization(options =&gt;
{
	options.FallbackPolicy = options.DefaultPolicy;
});

builder.Services.AddSingleton&lt;SessionTimeoutAsyncPageFilter&gt;();

builder.Services.AddRazorPages()
.AddMvcOptions(options =&gt;
{
	options.Filters.Add(typeof(SessionTimeoutAsyncPageFilter));
})
.AddMicrosoftIdentityUI();
  


<p></p>



<p>The IAsyncPageFilter interface is used to catch the request for the Razor Pages. The OnPageHandlerExecutionAsync method is used to implement the automatic end session logic. We use the default name identifier claim type to get an ID for the user. If using the standard claims instead of the Microsoft namespace mapping, this would be different. Match the claim returned in the id_token from the OpenID Connect authentication. I check for idle time. If no requests was sent in the last n-minutes, the application will sign-out, in both the local cookie and also on Azure AD B2C. It is important to sign-out on the identity provider as well. If the idle time is less than the allowed time span, the DateTime timestamp is persisted to cache.</p>



<p></p>


  public async Task OnPageHandlerExecutionAsync(PageHandlerExecutingContext context, PageHandlerExecutionDelegate next)
{
	var claimTypes = "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/nameidentifier";
	var name = context.HttpContext
		.User
		.Claims
		.FirstOrDefault(c =&gt; c.Type == claimTypes)!
		.Value;

	if (name == null) throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(name));

	var lastActivity = GetFromCache(name);

	if (lastActivity != null &amp;&amp; lastActivity.GetValueOrDefault()
		.AddMinutes(timeoutInMinutes) &lt; DateTime.UtcNow)
	{
		await context.HttpContext
			.SignOutAsync(CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme);
		await context.HttpContext
			.SignOutAsync(OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme);
	}

	AddUpdateCache(name);

	await next.Invoke();
}
  


<p>Distributed cache is used to persist the user idle time from each session. This might be expensive for applications with many users. In this demo, the UTC now value is used for the check. This might need to be improved and the cache length as well. This needs to be validated. if this is enough for all different combinations of timeout.</p>


  private void AddUpdateCache(string name)
{
	var options = new DistributedCacheEntryOptions()
		.SetSlidingExpiration(TimeSpan
			.FromDays(cacheExpirationInDays));

	_cache.SetString(name, DateTime
		.UtcNow.ToString("s"), options);
}

private DateTime? GetFromCache(string key)
{
	var item = _cache.GetString(key);
	if (item != null)
	{
		return DateTime.Parse(item);
	}

	return null;
}
  


<p>When the session timeouts, the code executes the OnPageHandlerExecutionAsync method and signouts.</p>







<p></p>



<p>This works for Razor Pages. This is not the only way of supporting this and it is not an easy requirement to fully implement. Next step would be to support this from SPA UIs which send Javascript or ajax requests.</p>

<p>The article looks at onboarding different Azure AD users with a temporary access pass (TAP) and some type of passwordless authentication. An ASP.NET Core application is used to create the Azure AD member users which can then use a TAP to setup the account. This is a great way to onboard users in your tenant.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/AzureAdTapOnboarding">https://github.com/damienbod/AzureAdTapOnboarding</a></p>



<p></p>



<p>The ASP.NET Core application needs to onboard different type of Azure AD users. Some users cannot use a passwordless authentication (yet) and so a password setup is also required for these users. TAP only works with members and we also need to support guest users with some alternative onboarding flow. Different type of user flows are supported or possible:</p>



 
 AAD member user flow with TAP and FIDO2 authentication 



 AAD member user flow with password using email/password authentication 



 AAD member user flow with password setup and a phone authentication 



 AAD guest user flow with federated login 



 AAD guest user flow with Microsoft account  



 AAD guest user flow with email code 
 



<p>FIDO2 should be used for all enterprise employees with an office account in the enterprise. If this is not possible, then at least the IT administrators should be forced to use FIDO2 authentication and the companies should be planning on a strategy on how to move to a phishing resistant authentication. This could be forced with a PIM and a continuous access policy for administration jobs. Using FIDO2, the identities are protected with a phishing resistant authentication. This should be a requirement for any professional solution.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Azure AD users with no computer can use an email code or a SMS authentication. This is a low security authentication and applications should not expose sensitive information to these user types. </p>



 Setup 



<p>The ASP.NET Core application uses Microsoft.Identity.Web and the Microsoft.Identity.Web.MicrosoftGraphBeta Nuget packages to implement the Azure AD clients. The ASP.NET Core client is a server rendered application and uses an Azure App registration which requires a secret or a certificate to acquire access tokens.</p>



<p>The onboarding application uses Microsoft Graph applications permissions to create the users and initialize the temporary access pass (TAP) flow. The following application permissions are used:</p>



<p></p>



 
 User.EnableDisableAccount.All 



 User.ReadWrite.All 



 UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite.All 
 



<p>The permissions are added to a separate Azure App registration and require a secret to use. In a second phase, I will look at implementing the Graph API access using Microsoft Graph delegated permissions.  It is also possible to use a service managed identity to acquire a Graph access token with the required permissions.</p>



<p></p>



 Onboarding members using passwordless 



<p>When onboarding a new Azure AD user with passwordless and TAP, this needs to be implemented in two steps. Firstly, a new Microsoft Graph user is created with the type member. This takes an unknown length of time to complete on Azure AD. When this is finished, a new TAP authentication method is created. I used the Polly Nuget package to retry this until the TAP request succeeds. Once successful, the temporary access pass is displayed in the UI. If this was a new employee or something like this, you could print this out and let the user complete the process. </p>


  private async Task CreateMember(UserModel userData)
{
	var createdUser = await _aadGraphSdkManagedIdentityAppClient
					.CreateGraphMemberUserAsync(userData);

	if (createdUser!.Id != null)
	{
		if (userData.UsePasswordless)
		{
			var maxRetryAttempts = 7;
			var pauseBetweenFailures = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(3);

			var retryPolicy = Policy
				.Handle&lt;HttpRequestException&gt;()
				.WaitAndRetryAsync(maxRetryAttempts, i =&gt; pauseBetweenFailures);

			await retryPolicy.ExecuteAsync(async () =&gt;
			{
				var tap = await _aadGraphSdkManagedIdentityAppClient
					.AddTapForUserAsync(createdUser.Id);

				AccessInfo = new CreatedAccessModel
				{
					Email = createdUser.Email,
					TemporaryAccessPass = tap!.TemporaryAccessPass
				};
			});
		}
		else
		{
			AccessInfo = new CreatedAccessModel
			{
				Email = createdUser.Email,
				Password = createdUser.Password
			};
		}
	}
}
  


<p>The CreateGraphMemberUserAsync method creates a new Microsoft Graph user. To use a temporary access pass, a member user must be used. Guest users cannot be onboarded like this. Even though we do not use a password in this process, the Microsoft Graph user validation forces us to create one. We just create a random password and will not return this, This password will not be updated.</p>


  public async Task&lt;CreatedUserModel&gt; CreateGraphMemberUserAsync
	(UserModel userModel)
{
	if (!userModel.Email.ToLower().EndsWith(_aadIssuerDomain.ToLower()))
	{
		throw new ArgumentException("A guest user must be invited!");
	}

	var graphServiceClient = _graphService
		.GetGraphClientWithManagedIdentityOrDevClient();

	var password = GetRandomString();
	var user = new User
	{
		DisplayName = userModel.UserName,
		Surname = userModel.LastName,
		GivenName = userModel.FirstName,
		OtherMails = new List&lt;string&gt; { userModel.Email },
		UserType = "member",
		AccountEnabled = true,
		UserPrincipalName = userModel.Email,
		MailNickname = userModel.UserName,
		PasswordProfile = new PasswordProfile
		{
			Password = password,
			// We use TAP if a paswordless onboarding is used
			ForceChangePasswordNextSignIn = !userModel.UsePasswordless
		},
		PasswordPolicies = "DisablePasswordExpiration"
	};

	var createdUser = await graphServiceClient.Users
		.Request()
		.AddAsync(user);

	return new CreatedUserModel
	{
		Email = createdUser.UserPrincipalName,
		Id = createdUser.Id,
		Password = password
	};
}
  


<p>The TemporaryAccessPassAuthenticationMethod object is created using Microsoft Graph. We create a use once TAP. The access code is returned and displayed in the UI.</p>


  public async Task&lt;TemporaryAccessPassAuthenticationMethod?&gt; 
	AddTapForUserAsync(string userId)
{
	var graphServiceClient = _graphService
		.GetGraphClientWithManagedIdentityOrDevClient();

	var tempAccessPassAuthMethod 
		= new TemporaryAccessPassAuthenticationMethod
	{
		//StartDateTime = DateTimeOffset.Now,
		LifetimeInMinutes = 60,
		IsUsableOnce = true, 
	};

	var result = await graphServiceClient.Users[userId]
		.Authentication
		.TemporaryAccessPassMethods
		.Request()
		.AddAsync(tempAccessPassAuthMethod);

	return result;
}
  


<p>The <a href="https://aka.ms/mysecurityinfo">https://aka.ms/mysecurityinfo</a> link can be used to complete the flow. The new user can click this link and enter the email and the access code.</p>







<p>Now that the user is authenticated, he or she can add a passwordless authentication method. I use an external FIDO2 key.</p>







<p>Once setup, the user can register and authenticate. You should use at least two security keys.</p>







<p></p>



<p>This is an awesome way of onboarding users which allows users to authenticate in a phishing resistant way without requiring or using a password. FIDO2 is the recommended and best way of authenticating users and with the rollout of passkeys, this will become more user friendly as well.</p>



 Onboarding members using password  



<p>Due to the fact that some companies still use legacy authentication or we would like to support users with no computer, we also need to onboard users with passwords. When using passwords, the user needs to update the password on first use. The user should add an MFA, if not forced by the tenant. Some employees might not have a computer and would like user a phone to authenticate. An SMS code would be a good way of achieving this. This is of course not very secure, so you should expect these accounts to get lost or breached and so sensitive data should be avoided for applications used by these accounts. The device code flow could be used together on a shared PC with the user mobile phone. Starting an authentication flow from a QR Code is unsecure as this is not safe against phishing but as SMS is used for these type of users, it’s already not very secure. Again sensitive data must be avoided for applications accepting these low security accounts. It’s all about balance, maybe someday soon, all users will have FIDO2 security keys or passkeys to use and we can avoid these sort of solutions.</p>

 Onboarding guest users (invitations) 



<p>Guest users cannot be onboarded by creating a Microsoft Graph user. You need to send an invitation to the guest user for your tenant. Microsoft Graph provides an API for this. There a different type of guest users, depending on the account type and the authentication method type. The invitation returns an invite redeem URL which can be used to setup the account. This URL is mailed to the email used in the invite and does not need to be displayed in the UI.</p>


  private async Task InviteGuest(UserModel userData)
{
	var invitedGuestUser = await _aadGraphSdkManagedIdentityAppClient
					.InviteGuestUser(userData, _inviteUrl);

	if (invitedGuestUser!.Id != null)
	{
		AccessInfo = new CreatedAccessModel
		{
			Email = invitedGuestUser.InvitedUserEmailAddress,
			InviteRedeemUrl = invitedGuestUser.InviteRedeemUrl
		};
	}
}
  


<p>The InviteGuestUser method is used to create the invite object and this is sent as a HTTP post request to the Microsoft Graph API.</p>


  public async Task&lt;Invitation?&gt; InviteGuestUser
	(UserModel userModel, string redirectUrl)
{
	if (userModel.Email.ToLower().EndsWith(_aadIssuerDomain.ToLower()))
	{
		throw new ArgumentException("user must be from a different domain!");
	}

	var graphServiceClient = _graphService
		.GetGraphClientWithManagedIdentityOrDevClient();

	var invitation = new Invitation
	{
		InvitedUserEmailAddress = userModel.Email,
		SendInvitationMessage = true,
		InvitedUserDisplayName 
			= $"{userModel.FirstName} {userModel.LastName}",
		InviteRedirectUrl = redirectUrl,
		InvitedUserType = "guest"
	};

	var invite = await graphServiceClient.Invitations
		.Request()
		.AddAsync(invitation);

	return invite;
}
  


<p></p>



 Notes 



<p>Onboarding users with Microsoft Graph can be complicated because you need to know which parameters and how the users need to be created. Azure AD members can be created using the Microsoft Graph user APIs, guest users are created using the Microsoft Graph invitation APIs. Onboarding users with TAP and FIDO2 is a great way of doing implementing this workflow. As of today, this is still part of the beta release.</p>

In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2023/01/16/mastodon-relationship-graphs/">Mastodon relationship graphs</a> I showed how to use Steampipe to <a href="https://steampipe.io/blog/release-0-18-0">map Mastodon network neighborhoods</a>. When I use the word map here, I’m channeling Denis Wood’s <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/26399801">The Power of Maps</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Every map shows this … but not that, and every map shows what it shows this way … but not the other way. Not only is this inescapable but it is precisely because of this interested selectivity — this choice of word or sign or aspect of the world to make a point — that the map is enabled to work.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The aspect chosen by those neighborhood maps is the boost — the Mastodon version of a retweet. <a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/mastodon-boosts-from-selected-server.png">One of the maps</a> focuses on a selected instance that appears in the home timeline. It shows people who belong to that instance and who boost toots from people on the same or different instances. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/mastodon-boosts-server-to-server.png">The other map</a> zooms out to show boost relationships among all the instances that appear in the home timeline. This view wouldn’t be legible if it included people, so it omits them in order to focus on server-to-server relationships.</p>
<p>
These maps represent (or as Denis Wood emphasizes, “re-present”) a set of toots. They omit original toots to which nobody replies, and they also omit replies, in order to focus on boost relationships. What about replies? That would be a different map, one that might also be interesting to draw.</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, though, I’ve come up with another map to display the tags that appear in the results of a Mastodon tag search, along with the accounts that use those tags. It proved its worth today when I was looking for perspectives on Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. As you’ve likely noticed, the US Supreme Court is reconsidering Section 230. My understanding of the topic wasn’t current, I wanted to refresh it, and I especially wanted to test whether Mastodon could provide a useful alternative to a conventional web search. </p>
<p>
One affordance that Mastodon provides: search for toots that use the #Section230 tag. Here are two ways to map the results of that search.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/section230.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>
On the left is a conventional Mastodon view: a list of toots that match the query. In this case the article I ultimately wanted to read appears way down in that list. The <a href="https://elk.zone/mastodon.social/@themarkup@mastodon.themarkup.org/109925750471340463">toot</a> that announced it was from <a href="https://themarkup.org/">The Markup</a>, “a nonprofit newsroom that investigates how powerful institutions are using technology to change our society.” The article, <a href="https://themarkup.org/hello-world/2023/02/25/section-230-is-a-load-bearing-wall-is-it-coming-down">Section 230 Is a Load-Bearing Wall — Is It Coming Down?</a>, transcribes part of a conversation with two legal scholars whom I know to be reliable guides to Net-related issues.</p>
<p>
On the right is my Steampipe-based Mastodon tag explorer. Working with the same data, it surfaced The Markup’s article in a way that brought it immediately to my attention. The first thing that caught my eye was the conjunction of two tags: #section230 and #scotus. Since the Supreme Court’s interest in Section 230 is what’s driving the current news cycle, I wanted to hear from legal scholars qualified to discuss the Court’s interest in Section 230. So the tag conjunction was a significant landmark.</p>
<p>
The map displayed two nodes that connect to both #section230 and #scotus. How did I choose between them? My prior familiarity with The Markup led me to click on that node and visit the Markup’s <a href="https://mastodon.themarkup.org/public/local">Mastodon instance</a> where I read the article. </p>
<p>
Had I been following The Markup then, as I am now, I would likely have seen the article on the <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2023/02/14/news-in-the-fediverse/">news list</a> to which I’ve assigned The Markup’s account. But that wouldn’t have changed the experience of searching for the #section230 tag. The relationship graph works by reformulating the results of that search. It omits the text of toots that contain the tag, and the images in those toots, in order to highlight two aspects of the result list: people (or accounts) and tags. It contextualizes those tags by charting their relative frequency in the result list. And it attaches, to each tag node, a link to a new graph focused on that tag. </p>
<p>
This “interested selectivity” enables the map to do its work: find accounts that use given tags. Like a tag node, an account nodes provides a link — in this case, to the account’s Mastodon home page. It also reports the accounts’ description using a property that appears when hovering the node. So if I were unfamiliar with The Markup I could reveal its description without leaving the graph. Here’s the query that adds that property to the node.</p>
 select
  note
from 
  mastodon_search_account
where 
  query = 'https://mastodon.themarkup.org/@themarkup'

+---------------------+
| note                |
+---------------------+
|  Watching Big Tech. |
+---------------------+
 
<p>
That query is embedded in another query that joins across two Steampipe plugins: one that <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-mastodon">wraps the Mastodon API</a> and another that <a href="https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/rss">queries RSS feeds</a>. That’s because, as noted in <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2022/12/06/mastodon-steampipe-and-rss/">Mastodon, Steampipe, and RSS</a>, the RSS feeds that Mastodon provides for tags enrich the results available from the core API.</p>
<p>
Enabling SQL to query diverse APIs in a common way is one of Steampipe’s core superpowers. Enabling such queries to form the nodes and edges of relationship graphs is another. Used together, these two superpowers enable maps that select what is helpful, omit what isn’t, and thus “re-present” information for a given purpose.</p>

<p>Worldwide, policymakers, in response to measurable threats and harms to children online and due to a desire to make the Internet safer for children, are updating existing and issuing new age verification and assurance regulations. Age verification is the practice of verifying an individual’s age. Age assurance is a process of verifying or estimating, with a level of&nbsp;certainty and accuracy, an individual’s age.</p>
<p>The goal of this paper is to document and share the prevailing consensus on what is happening with AGE assurance regulations — how regulations and the field are most likely to evolve and what actions organizations will likely be required to take to comply with the new regulations and technical demands.</p>
<p>Age assurance is the collective term used globally to refer to the processes and technologies used to verify an individual’s age, estimate an individual’s age, and determine with a level of certainty that an individual’s claimed or estimated age is accurate (i.e., truthful, substantiated, and verifiable).</p>
<p>We discuss why age verification and assurance matters and what you and your organization should consider to help make the internet a safer place for children and to protect your organization.</p>

<p>【ブリュッセル23日】OpenWallet Foundation の発足が日本時間23日深夜に発表されました。</p>



<p>OpenWallet Foundationはデジタル版の証明書や鍵、チケット、カードと言ったものを収めるデジタル財布である「ウォレット」の共通部品を作るためのLinux Foundation配下のオープンソース団体です。個別の機能を開発するプロジェクトの上に団体としての理事会、政府諮問会議、技術諮問会議が組織されます。</p>



<p>初期の理事メンバーはアクセンチュア、フューチャーウェイ、Gen（旧ノートン＋Avast）、VISAで<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/02/5200/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-5200" title="日本円で約3100万円拠出しています">1</a>、一般メンバー<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/02/5200/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-5200" title="会社の規模に応じて最大1000万円程度の会費を払っています">2</a>にはAmexなどが並んでいます。</p>



<p>OpenWallet はWallet自体ではありません。BlinkなどがWebブラウザ自体ではなくWebブラウザのエンジンであるように、ウォレットのエンジンを提供します。これによって、各社が自社のウォレットを作ることができるようになるのです。</p>



<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.sakimura.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/OWF-Launch-2023.02.23.pptx-1.jpg?ssl=1"></a>OpenWallet はWalletのエンジン<br>(source) OpenWallet Foundation



<p>また、OpenWallet Foundation は規格の開発などは行いません。行うのは、ウォレットを作るために必要になる機能群を収めたライブラリ＝ウォレットエンジンです。これを使って各社はウォレットを作ることができます。同じエンジンを使っていれば、一つのウォレットから他のウォレットに移るのもより簡単になると期待されます。</p>



<p>発表に付随するイベントで、OpenID Foundation理事長のNat Sakimura は、以下のように述べました。</p>



<blockquote>
<p>ユーザー中心主義とプライバシーはデジタルIDに関する技術標準化団体であるOpenID Foundationの中核的な原則で す。15年前のブラウザがそうであったようにウォレットは今この原則を達成するための最前線にいるのです。しかしウォレットが介在しているだけではそれを達成することはできません。ウォレットのコードに対する信頼が必要です。そのためにはオープンソースの実装が提供する透明性が不可欠でありOpenWallet Foundationとの協働を期待しています。</p>

The first post, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/10/19/idtech-is-the-new-fintech/?sh=3553171a3a88">IDtech is the New Fintech</a> is available to read on Forbes, and the second post, <a href="https://medium.com/trinsic/intro-to-idtech-how-decentralized-identity-will-be-adopted-2a3fb9abf6bb">Intro to IDtech: How Decentralized Identity Will be Adopted</a>, can be found here on my&nbsp;Medium.</p><p>If you’ve been following the SSI space over the last few months, it’s likely you’ve seen the term “IDtech” used to describe the product or “application layer” of the cutting-edge identity standards like verifiable credentials. I have <a href="https://medium.com/trinsic/has-ssis-identity-problem-been-solved-2d33490315ae">spoken at length</a> about this term, whether that is on <a href="https://twitter.com/rileyphughes">Twitter</a>, via <a href="https://trinsic.id/">Trinsic</a>, or through my <a href="https://trinsic.id/podcast/">podcast</a>, because I believe it can do for identity products what ‘FinTech’, ‘EdTech’, or ‘Medtech’ do for those categories of products.</p><p>The more I’ve seen IDtech used, the more I see three misconceptions cropping up into conversations.</p><p>❌ IDtech is a rebrand of SSI or decentralized identity.</p><p>❌ IDtech is overly&nbsp;broad.</p><p>❌ IDtech is a new category.</p><p>But before I address these misconceptions, I think it is worth clarifying what IDtech&nbsp;is.</p> How Can You Tell an IDtech Product When You See&nbsp;One? <p>Let’s start with a definition from a <a href="https://medium.com/trinsic/intro-to-idtech-how-decentralized-identity-will-be-adopted-2a3fb9abf6bb">previous&nbsp;post</a>:</p><blockquote>IDtech is the name for the category of products that empower users to take control of their identity, share their data safely, and more securely access the things they&nbsp;need.</blockquote><p>The most important thing to understand about IDtech is that it’s a word to describe a kind of product (as opposed to a philosophy, concept, or technology). Therefore, the first way to tell whether you’re talking about IDtech is to determine whether you’re talking about a tangible product that solves a problem for customers, or potential customers. Booked revenue is an indication that something has moved beyond “use case” and beyond “business case” into a full-fledged product.</p><blockquote>If a fintech product helps you manage your money, an IDtech product helps you manage your identity and&nbsp;data.</blockquote><p>It may be just as helpful to call out the things that don’t help you identify&nbsp;IDtech.</p>  The form factor doesn’t matter. Many IDtech products are mobile apps, while others are web-based, and others live in a browser extension or smart&nbsp;watch.  The tech stack (e.g. use of web3 or blockchain) doesn’t matter either. Because IDtech describes a kind of product, not a technical approach, developers can draw from technologies in web2, web3, or web5 or (any number of future webs) to build their solutions.  The industry vertical is also irrelevant. While I’ve seen IDtech companies in regulated industries like healthcare, finance, and government, I’ve seen adoption succeed in other areas as&nbsp;well.  <p>Hopefully the stage is set and we all agree on what IDtech is. Now we can dive in to three common misconceptions.</p> Misconception #1: IDtech Is a Rebrand of Self-sovereign Identity or Decentralized Identity <p>I understand why this misconception exists. Given that my background and company is in the SSI and decentralized identity space, it is easy to see why people associate the term IDtech to those things when I use it. However, I consider anything that meets the two criteria of 1) empowering users with identity and 2) it is productized to fall under the broad IDtech umbrella. Products in this umbrella include things from <a href="http://dentity.com/">Dentity</a> to <a href="http://clearme.com/">Clear</a> to <a href="http://axuall.com/">Axuall</a> to <a href="http://classpass.com/">Classpass</a> to <a href="http://getportabl.com/">Portabl</a>. Decentralization is not a binary; and these products all sit on a bit of a different spot on the spectrum of self-sovereignty — some are fully custodial while others are totally centralized.</p><p>At the risk of sounding like a broken record (I recently wrote a <a href="https://medium.com/trinsic/has-ssis-identity-problem-been-solved-2d33490315ae">whole post</a> about this), self-sovereign identity is a concept or an ideal. Decentralized identity generally refers to a set of technologies. But IDtech refers to a class of product — or said another way, the set of solutions to a particular problem.</p><p>All that being said, my personal belief is that in the long run, the winning IDtech products will be built using decentralized identity and will get users closer to self-sovereignty.</p> Misconception #2: IDtech Is Overly&nbsp;Broad <p>Another misconception is that IDtech is too broad of a term. Usually this stems from a belief that IDtech encompasses everything from <a href="http://okta.com/">Okta</a> to <a href="http://equifax.com/">Equifax</a> to <a href="http://onfido.com/">Onfido</a> to <a href="http://entidad.io/">Entidad</a>. In reality, the only one of these I classify as an IDtech product is Entidad. Okta is an authentication infrastructure. Onfido is a verification widget. Equifax is a data aggregator. In fact, I’m aware of an IDtech product that uses Okta, Onfido, and Equifax together to achieve a particular user experience in their&nbsp;product.</p> Misconception #3: IDtech Is a New&nbsp;Category <p>Again, IDtech describes products that empower users to take control of their identity, share their data safely, and more securely access the things they need. These kinds of products have been around for decades. So despite the word only recently beginning to be used, products that fit this description are not&nbsp;new.</p><p>Dozens of IDtech products like those offered by <a href="http://clearme.com/">Clear</a>, <a href="https://www.merits.com/">Merit</a>, and <a href="https://airsidemobile.com/">Airside</a> were started over the last few decades, streamlining millions of consumers’ lives. Like the FinTech companies started in the early 2000s before open banking or fintech infrastructure, early IDtech companies had to blaze a trail of proprietary technology themselves. Fortunately, today decentralized identity represents a new way to build IDtech products — and infrastructure platforms such as Trinsic make it easier than ever. What used to take a whole team, millions of dollars, and years to build can now be done in a matter of weeks. So it’s easy to see why a surge of new-age IDtech companies are rising to the occasion.</p> IDtech Is About to Have Its&nbsp;Moment <p>Although IDtech is not a rebrand of “SSI” or “decentralized identity”, these technologies do check a lot of the boxes good IDtech products hope to achieve. And IDtech infrastructure companies (like Trinsic) that utilize SSI technologies are making it easier than ever to build IDtech products that serve specific industries or use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>An explosion of IDtech products is currently underway showing that IDtech is indeed the new Fintech. This revolution in identity products will transform how identity works today and make the world more accessible for&nbsp;all.</p><p>These ideas continue to develop. If you have feedback for me, or if you’re building an IDtech product, I’d love to hear from you — my DMs are open on <a href="https://twitter.com/rileyphughes">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rileyparkerhughes/">LinkedIn</a>. You should also check out <a href="http://trinsic.id">Trinsic</a>, the best infrastructure for building IDtech products. If this post was insightful, please share it with others that will learn from it, and follow me so you don’t miss subsequent posts where I’ll dive deeper into the concepts and practices behind successful IDtech products.</p>

  I've had a busy month. Something had to drop and it was regular updates here. Hopefully I’m back to a more regular schedule now. Technological change is messy and hard to predict. Still we can look at the direction in which digital identity is evolving to get an idea what's coming—even if we can't predict the timing.

Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.</p>       <p>Riley Hughes and I recently had a conversation about the question "why doesn't SSI exist already?" Sometimes the question is asked because people think it's such a natural idea that it's surprising that it's not the norm. Other times, the question is really a statement "if this were really a good idea, it would exist already!" Regardless of which way it's asked, the answer is interesting since it's more about the way technology develops and is adopted than the technology itself.</p><p>Riley calls identity products "extremely objectionable" meaning that there are plenty of reasons for people to object to them including vendor lock-in, privacy concerns, security concerns, and consumer sentiment. I think he's right. You're not asking people and companies to try a new app (that they can easily discard if it doesn't provide value). You're asking them to change the fundamental means that they use to form, manage, and use online relationships.</p> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0BS2H4HT1/technometria-20">   </a> <p>The last chapter of my new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0BS2H4HT1/technometria-20">Learning Digital Identity</a>, makes a case that there is an existing identity <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2022/02/life_is_a_metasystem.shtml">metasystem</a> that I label the Social Login (SL) metasystem. The SL metasystem is supported by OpenID Connect and the various "login in with..." identity providers. The SL metasystem is widely used and has provided significant value to the online world.</p><p>There is also an emerging Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) metasystem based on DIDs and verifiable credentials. I evaluate each in terms of <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/01/the_laws_of_identity.shtml">Kim Cameron’s Laws of Identity</a>. In this evaluation, the SL metasystem comes out pretty good. I believe this accounts for much of its success. But it fails in some key areas like not supporting directed (meaning not public) identifiers. As a result of these failings, SLM has not been universally adoptable. Banks, for example, aren’t going to use Google Signin for a number of reasons.</p><p>The SSI Metasystem, on the other hand, meets all of Cameron’s Laws. Consequently, I think it will eventually be widely adopted and gradually replace the SL metasystem. The key word being eventually. The pace of technological change leads us to expect that change will happen very quickly. Some things (like the latest hot social media app) seem to happen overnight. But infrastructural change, especially when it requires throwing out old mental models about how things should work is much slower. The fact is, we’ve been building toward the ideas in SSI (not necessarily the specific tech) for several decades. Work at IIW on user-centric identity led to the SL metasystem. But the predominant mental model of that metasystem didn't change much from the one-off centralized accounts people used before. You still get an account administrated bythe relying party, they've just outsourced the authentication to someone else. (Which means another party is intermediating the relationship). Overcoming that mental model, especially with entrenched interests, is a long slog.</p><p>In the 80s and 90s (pre-web) people were only online through the grace of their institution (university or company). So, I was <code>windley@cs.ucdavis.edu</code> and there was no reason to be anything else. When the web hit, I needed to be represented (have an account) in dozens or hundreds of places with whom I no longer had a long term relationship (like employee or student). So, we moved the idea of an account from workstation operating systems to the online service. And became Sybill.</p><p>When Kim first introduced the Laws of Identity, I literally didn’t understand what he as saying. I understood the words but not the ideas. Certainly not the ramifications. I don’t think many did. He’s the first person I know who understood the problems and set out a coherent set of principles to solve them. We <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2008/12/azigos_remindme_service.shtml">used Infocards in our product at Kynetx</a> and they worked pretty well. But because of how they were rolled out, people came to associate them strictly with Microsoft. The SL metasystem won out, offering the benefits of federation, without requiring that people, developers, or companies change their mental model.</p><p>Changing metasystems isn't a matter of technology. It's a social phenomenon. Consequently it's slow and messy. Here's my answer to the question "why doesn't this exist yet?" The arc of development for digital identity systems has been bending toward user-controlled, decentralized digital identity for decades. That doesn't mean that SSI, as currently envisioned, is inevitable. Just that something like it, that better complies with Kim's laws than the current metasystem, is coming. Maybe a year from now. Maybe a decade. No one can say. But it's coming. Plan and work accordingly.</p><p></p>   <p>Thanks for reading Phil Windley's Technometria!

<p>Blockchain is one of the fastest-growing technologies in the world. Most companies are trying to implement the scope of blockchain for the growth of their business. Therefore, they are looking for skilled blockchain developers who would help them to execute new technologies and to update their existing systems so that they can ensure growth in the market.</p>



<p>As blockchain is revolutionizing the world, there is a huge demand for blockchain developers. Without them, it is not possible to utilize the <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/feature/Top-10-benefits-of-blockchain-technology-for-business">benefits of blockchain technology</a>. The developers are responsible for all the research on the blockchain and the execution of the benefits of blockchain. Developers will be responsible for building the system’s architecture, creating smart contracts, as well as optimizing the protocols. As they need to handle a lot of responsibilities, they need to have certain skills.</p>


 
 


 
 Cryptography 
 



<p>To offer a safe blockchain environment, cryptography is very important. Therefore blockchain developers must have a good understanding of cryptographic practices and concepts including crypto keys, wallets, and digital signatures. Cryptography is a crucial element in ensuring the security and trustworthiness of the Bitcoin network and other cryptocurrencies. Such highly secure crypto is easily accessible with trading bots like bitcode prime. According to <a href="https://www.etf-nachrichten.de/autotrading/bitcode-prime/">bitcode prime test 2023</a>, it is designed to help users trade a wide range of cryptocurrencies on various markets in the cryptocurrency industry. Developers must have the knowledge to make use of public-key cryptography to avoid unauthorized access. They should also understand the dissimilarities between the different cryptographic hash functions such as Keccak-256 and SHA-256.</p>



 
 Blockchain architecture 
 



<p>Blockchain developers must have a good idea about the way blockchain works and its architecture. They should also know concepts like a consensus, smart contracts, distributed ledgers, and others that are very important in the functioning of blockchain technology. They should also know the four basic types of blockchain architecture – private, public, consortium, and hybrid.</p>



 
 Data Structures 
 



<p>The presence of data structures is an unavoidable part of the whole blockchain network. Every block is a data structure type that gathers all the transactions specifically for the public ledger. Blockchain developers must study data structures thoroughly and should understand the way blockchain network makes use of data structure. Developers must also understand the different types of data structures like heaps, graphs, Merkle trees, Patricia trees, and hash trees.</p>



 
 Smart Contracts 
 



<p>Smart contracts allow two parties to transfer services and goods without any intermediaries. Smart contracts are a predominant factor while implementing blockchains. Therefore, developers must be familiar with these smart contracts and how they can be used for business. They should also know the programming languages that are widely used in the execution of smart contracts like Chaincode, Solidity, or Vyper.</p>


 
 


 
 Web development 
 



<p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/web-development/">Web development</a> is very important as blockchain gives high importance to decentralized applications. Therefore developers must have good skills in web development like designing and developing web applications, technologies that back them up, and the steps that can be taken for the optimization and security of these applications.</p>



 
 Programming languages 
 



<p>Various programming languages are used by the blockchain technologies and will be different according to the platforms used to execute the blockchain environment. Developers need not be experts in all the languages, but they should have some basic knowledge of some of the popular languages like Python, C++, or JavaScript. It is also good if the developers have some idea of object-oriented programming.</p>

  Probably not but at there end there are 10 ways to prevent assumptions becoming culture <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Post the 2008 global financial crisis, the president of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, said in an opening address at the ECB Central Banking Conference Frankfurt, 18 November 2010, “<a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2010/html/sp101118.en.html">As a policymaker during the crisis, I found the available models of limited help. In fact, I would go further: In the face of the crisis, we felt abandoned by conventional tools</a>.”</p><br><p></p><br> The Gap <p>Many in executive and leadership positions have faced for a while a feeling that our models, simulations and computations are ill-suited to addressing big, messy, complicated real-world problems. There is a gap between the reality we read and measure today and the model that predicted today a short period ago. &nbsp; Since we have yet to create new models and continue to utilise the same ideals, we know there is a gap between prediction and reality, and that gap is leading to poor decisions, which make us see a bigger gap.&nbsp;</p><p>Decisions based on models today have short and long-term consequences. Poor decisions because of broken models lead to us missing an agreed performance metric and impact our children as they live with choices removed and unintended outcomes.&nbsp;</p><p>It is accepted by some commentators that <a href="https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/glossary/utility-maximisation/">utility maximisation</a> (the economic concept) is a poor way to navigate uncertainty.&nbsp; The reason is that uncertainty means you cannot be sure you are optimising for the best thing in the short and long term. The map and directions our economic models provide cannot deliver a compass for wicked problems such as climate change and pandemics.&nbsp;</p><p>A reason our models fail may be that they start with the wrong outcome preference, framing and assumption, which over time are transformed to no longer be preferences, framings and assumptions but beliefs and culture, and we cannot change them before they break — path dependency.&nbsp; An assumption our utility maximisation economic model took a while back was to value the time of humans unequally (discrimination), and now technology laboured to convert the earth's unvalued natural resources. With this model, humanity ignores the consequences of previous generations' assumptions because they are now cultural, which we experience as differing views on the environment, society and climate.</p> Does system thinking break at earth scale? <p>Many of our complex models start with a decomposition ideal to break apart complexity into small discrete components that we find we can model and explore. However, even our understanding of atoms, once the most fundamental building block, actually contains secrets that we still can't fathom; such is the joy of quantum mechanics.&nbsp; As we break things apart, we break connections we did not know existed, and so we cannot recombine the components and make what we started with.</p><p>Components don't combine to make the hole. I can put all your chemistry in a bucket, but it will not make you.&nbsp;</p><p>If our model depends on the complete understanding of the smallest part and that the understanding is perfect and precise, then when doubt arises or the proof comes that this smallest part is not what we assumed, why do we think that the model will retain its ability to provide precise prediction?&nbsp; When we study our smallest component parts in isolation, what linkages were there to other parts that we did not observe?</p><p>Our systems thinking and models depend on a form of separation, boundary, and interface that help us detail how these small components interact.&nbsp; We have a duality of issue insomuch that if our understanding of the smaller part is not right and we also make an error in the dependencies about how this small part interacts, effects, affects and connects to other small parts, we end up with non-linear errors in our models.&nbsp; Exponential (non-linear) errors, just like exponential growth, get big very quickly.&nbsp;</p><p>There is a branch of thinking that retains the idea that we will get a large-scale model right because we should be able to model each small basic component part and the dependency between all parts, but we face a dichotomy that we don't know that if the whole can be represented by the parts, because of variables in time delays and the emergence of new recursive loops in the system, which is why our system thinking breaks at earth's scale. At scale, the earth is not a static model but a dynamic living, moving, changing and adapting system of systems.&nbsp; The earth is adopting (not learning), and today's system creates a dynamic change that means tomorrow's system has different dependencies. &nbsp; Our decisions impact and direct that change.</p><p>In the small backwater of behaviours, economics and social psychology, there is a discipline called anthropology, the study of human behaviours, which searches for differences and how these tiny one-off behaviours and ideas may be the future and may scale. Hidden in plain sight among all the noise and hubris is the new dynamic changes, which means that our understanding of the small parts and the dependency must adapt continually, or we must recognise that small errors at scale will give false conclusions. It is not that the emerging feedback loop existed when it started; it was created because of the dynamic nature of complex systems. &nbsp; We lack right now the tools to create such new dynamic loops. This means that all our models are wrong; we just don't know by how much.</p><p>We lack right now the tools to create such new dynamic loops. This means that all our models are wrong; we just don't know by how much.</p><p>Just because all models are wrong, that does not mean they are not useful, but it does mean we need all models and cannot align to only one when we are dealing with issues at the earth scale.&nbsp; This implies that 1.5 degrees are both right and wrong, as is 3.5 degrees.&nbsp; Indeed the idea that any temperature is right or wrong is naive. Further, any one metric that we use as a tool for complex decision-making is going to be wrong.&nbsp;</p> Decisions based on metrics. <p>The consequence of the maximisation theory that drives our model has ignored or unvalued some cost. It also maximises for a single outcome, which is never possible.&nbsp; This means that the opposite side of that coin is true, that there will always be an overstatement of revenue and margin that can lead to false intentions.</p><p>We are drawn to decisions not based on costs but on the increment between revenue and costs (margin); we shortcut the complexity of the model to a single figure, ROI. Just like temperature in climate models. ROI decisions based on only costs do not exist and, therefore, as a viewpoint, it is discounted - reinforcing culture/ framing and mindset. ROI will always fail as a decision tool as there will always be undervalued costs and hurdles that mean we stretch the assumptions, but we love the idea of boling complexity down to a simple linear narrative.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Can models navigate uncertainty, probably not, but they are the best tool we have.&nbsp; Assuming they are a true compass is a dangerous game, especially if we have a culture that means we cannot challenge the model itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I suppose here is the reality, system thinking will fail at the earth scale because assumptions become culture, and we don’t have any examples that culture changes before it breaks.&nbsp; If the model cannot be challenged, we will have to wait until it breaks.</p><p>We don’t have any examples that culture changes before it breaks.<br><br></p> Leadership can stop assumptions from becoming culture <p>Assumptions can become part of a culture when they are repeated and reinforced over time, often without questioning or examining their accuracy or relevance.&nbsp; Assumptions become a part of culture when they are widely held and perpetuated through social norms and values.</p><p>To prevent assumptions from becoming entrenched in the company culture, it's important that leadership take steps to challenge and question them, as well as to actively promote more inclusive and open-minded ways of thinking.</p><p>So we we asked ChatGPT for some specific recommendations on how to prevent assumptions becoming culture; we will leave it up to you to judge.</p><p>ChatGPT please give some specific steps that can help prevent assumptions from becoming a culture?</p>  <p>Encourage critical thinking: Promote a culture of critical thinking and encourage people to challenge assumptions and beliefs that are taken for granted. This can help to break down the barriers that prevent people from questioning assumptions and can lead to more open-minded and inclusive thinking.</p>  <p>Encourage and promote diversity: Encourage diversity in all forms, whether it's through hiring practices, community events, or other initiatives. This can help to break down stereotypes and promote understanding across different cultures and perspectives by exposing people to a wider range of perspectives and experiences.</p>  <p>Foster open communication: Create a culture of open communication where people feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and ideas without fear of judgment. This can help to prevent assumptions from becoming entrenched by allowing people to openly question and discuss them.</p>  <p>Educate everyone: Provide education and training on topics such as cultural competency, unconscious bias, and diversity and inclusion. This can help people to become more aware of their own assumptions and biases, and can promote more inclusive thinking. Share your findings and insights with others. Explain why certain assumptions are inaccurate and how they can be harmful. Encourage others to question their assumptions as well.</p>  <p>Lead by example: It's important to lead by example. Model the behavior that you want to see in others by questioning your own assumptions and being open to new perspectives. By doing so, you can help to create a culture where assumptions are not accepted without question, and where people are encouraged to think critically and with an open mind.</p>  <p>Emphasize transparency: Encourage open and honest language, and be transparent about the assumptions that underlie decisions and actions. This can help to build trust and promote accountability.</p>  <p>Continuously assess and evaluate: Regularly review assumptions and cultural norms to determine whether they are still relevant and accurate. This can help to prevent assumptions from becoming outdated or misaligned with current needs and realities.</p>  <p>Be aware of your assumptions: Start by examining your own assumptions and biases. Ask yourself where they come from and whether they are based on evidence or stereotypes. Awareness is the first step in changing behavior.</p>  <p>Challenge assumptions: When you encounter assumptions that don't feel right, question them. Look for evidence that supports or contradicts them. If an assumption is not based on evidence, it should be discarded.</p>  Hold people accountable: Finally, hold people accountable for their assumptions. Call out harmful assumptions when you see them, and encourage others to do the same. Make it clear that assumptions are not acceptable in your culture.

<p>This article looks at setting up Hangfire with ASP.NET Core and an SQL server. Hangfire provides a solution to run recurring jobs and background jobs with an excellent dashboard to monitor the events.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCoreHangfire">https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCoreHangfire</a></p>



<p>History</p>



<p>2023-02-21 Fix Delete background job to delete recurring job, feedback from Alex</p>



<p></p>



<p>The ASP.NET Core application uses two Hangfire Nuget packages to integrate the event handling into the solution.</p>



 
 Hangfire.AspNetCore 



 Hangfire.SqlServer 
 



<p></p>



<p>The program file initializes the services and adds the middleware to the project. The SQL Server is setup using the extension methods from the Hangfire Nuget packages and uses a connection string from the app settings in development.</p>


  public static void Main(string[] args)
{
	var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
	var services = builder.Services;
	var configuration = builder.Configuration;
	var env = builder.Environment;

	services.AddHangfire(hangfire =&gt;
	{
		hangfire.SetDataCompatibilityLevel(CompatibilityLevel.Version_170);
		hangfire.UseSimpleAssemblyNameTypeSerializer();
		hangfire.UseRecommendedSerializerSettings();
		hangfire.UseColouredConsoleLogProvider();
		hangfire.UseSqlServerStorage(
                     configuration.GetConnectionString("HangfireConn"), 
			new SqlServerStorageOptions
			{
				CommandBatchMaxTimeout = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5),
				SlidingInvisibilityTimeout = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5),
				QueuePollInterval = TimeSpan.Zero,
				UseRecommendedIsolationLevel = true,
				DisableGlobalLocks = true 
			});

		var server = new BackgroundJobServer(new BackgroundJobServerOptions
		{
			ServerName = "hangfire-test",
		});
	});
	
	// other services...

	var app = builder.Build();


	app.UseHangfireDashboard();

	// more middleware...

	app.Run();
}
  


<p></p>



 SQL database setup 



<p>The SQL database is setup using the Hangfire documentation.</p>



<p><a href="https://docs.hangfire.io/en/latest/configuration/using-sql-server.html">https://docs.hangfire.io/en/latest/configuration/using-sql-server.html</a></p>



<p>The hangfire <a href="https://github.com/HangfireIO/Hangfire/blob/master/src/Hangfire.SqlServer/Install.sql">script</a> can be found in the hangfire repository. I also added a copy of this script in the demo repository: hangfire-default-install.sql</p>



 Create a recurring job 



<p>Now that Hangfire is setup, jobs can be created. I use a class to implement the method called after a Hangfire event has been fired. The method must be reentrant and needs to handle the exceptions.</p>


  public class MyRecurringJob : IMyRecurringJob
{
    public void DoSomethingReentrant()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("IMyRecurringJob doing something");
    }
}
  


<p>The job can be created using the RecurringJob.AddOrUpdate method. This adds the job to the SQL database.</p>


  RecurringJob.AddOrUpdate&lt;IMyRecurringJob&gt;(
   job =&gt; job.DoSomethingReentrant(), Cron.Hourly);
  


 Create a background job 



<p>A Hnagfire background job can be created using the BackgroundJob.Enqueue method. The methods have various parameters which can be used anc covers most of the event, job requirements which can exist. </p>


  BackgroundJob.Enqueue&lt;IMyBackgroundJob&gt;(x =&gt; x.DoSomethingReentrant());
  


 Delete recurring jobs 



<p>Deleting the jobs is required if you deploy regularly as different instances are created and new recurring jobs are created then. The following code makes it possible to delete the recurring jonbs.</p>


  using (var connection = JobStorage.Current.GetConnection())
{
	foreach (var recurringJob in connection.GetRecurringJobs())
	{
		RecurringJob.RemoveIfExists(recurringJob.Id);
	}
}
  


 Running the applications 



<p>When the applications are created and different jobs can be created or deleted. </p>







<p></p>



 Hangfire Dashboard 



<p>Hangfire provides an excellent dashboard which can display the running or failed jobs and the different server setups.</p>







<p></p>



 Notes 



<p>This is just the basic setup of Hangfire. You can integrate Hangfire in various ways into a solution, but KISS should always be followed. Using events inside solutions is already complicated and requires extra tools to monitor and debug. You should also only use this if the business logic requires this. To use Hangfire inside a professional solution, you would need to add security to the dashboard, probably inject services inside the code that executes the jobs which has problems, add logging and the executing code must be reentrant due to retries. </p>



<p></p>



<p>Hangfire is a great tool as with many other tools, solutions for this type of problem. The jobs need to be reentrant. For long running workflows which require persistence, maybe other tools would be the better choice, for example Azure durable functions or power automate. Background services also work really good for simple jobs. ASP.NET Core Quartz can also be used. All these tools are very good and you should try to choose the one which best fits your needs and follows the KISS principal.</p>

 FediForum<br>
 March 29 and 30<br>
 <a href="https://fediforum.org/">fediforum.org</a>
 
<p>Like many, I have been watching the destruction of Twitter by its new owner with
utter fascination. If it was problematic in many ways before, Musk-Twitter is far worse,
and there are no signs it will ever return to the state that many of us, myself included,
mostly enjoyed.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are alternatives, led by Mastodon and a rapidly-growing list of
Fediverse apps that all interoperate thanks to a number of open protocols such as
WebFinger, ActivityPub and Activity Vocabulary. Millions of people have created accounts
there in recent months, and over a million new users have become regulars.</p>
<p>But there are growing pains and many open questions, such as:</p>
 
 The underlying protocol standards are currently essentially unmaintained, and
real-implementations don’t exactly match how the standards were intended. How will this
situation be resolved? 
 How do we create and maintain a safe space for traditionally disenfranchised people? 
 The Fediverse currently depends on much unpaid volunteer work. How long can that
go well? What if another million users (or more!) join, and the novelty effect
wears off? 
 Should brands be allowed in? 
 Is #Fediblock the best we can do for moderation? 
 How do we keep the character of the place if (when!) large organizations come in
that bring lots of new users, and, in comparison, large budgets? 
 Who decides? 
 
<p>Conversations need to be had, in a form that encourages problem solving. That’s
the kind of space we are trying to create with FediForum: where people meet who
want to move the Fediverse forward: on technology, on funding, on operations,
on governance, and perhaps on culture.</p>
<p>Because if we don’t, there’s a real chance the once-in-a-generation opportunity to
build better social media passes, and I really, really don’t want that to happen.
I hope you don’t either.</p>
<p>So, if you love Mastodon or any other post-Twitter social media apps, and have an opinion
on the future of social media, <a href="https://fediforum.org/">join us</a> and help figure it out
together with others who think similarly. The first event will be on-line; we hope
to be able to do an in-person event later this year.</p>

   Today we learned that a 34 year old hockey player, a 6x all-star in the NHL’s list of 100 greatest players of all time, stopped playing hockey several weeks ago due to Long Covid. 

 The covid minimizer that now owns Twitter intentionally allows misinformation to spread. Mask up.

 <p>I have been exploring the research and concepts that bias and trauma are deeply linked.&nbsp; The linkage and directionality are much debated. &nbsp; Trauma creates bias, and equally, bias creates trauma. It would appear that either can be a starting point, but they definitely feed each other, creating complex positive (healing) and negative (detrimental) feedback loops which extend beyond the individual and their immediate relationships to wider society.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p></p><p>Using systems-mapping to address Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) and trauma: A qualitative study of stakeholder experiences&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0273361">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0273361</a></p><br><p>Why does this matter, as all data has a bias?&nbsp;</p><p>Fundamental to a decision-making role based on data is to demand that we recognise bias and try to remove bias; however, I am now thinking that if we remove the bias, we assume there is no trauma, and therefore, everyone will be rational.&nbsp; Yes, there are some big ugly assumptions in that statement, but the purpose here is about the flow of challenging thinking and not academic rigour to prove something we already know.&nbsp;</p><p>In removing the bias, we ignore that bias feeds trauma and that equally, trauma feeds bias; a decision made without this context has no coupling to the reality of the situation.&nbsp; The alternative is that we live with the bias in our data, known and unknown; however, we don't know if the analysis for this person in this situation reflects/ fuels/heals their bias/ trauma or not.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, the framing of removing bias is not valid; equality, a framing that recognises bias, is not valid as it cannot represent the individual.</p><p>Houston, we have a problem. Do we have to reframe bias?</p><p>I am all up for understanding bias, but it has become more evident to me that in my thrust to be curious about bias, I have to accept that I am going to have to operate in a dynamic feedback loop, and it will uncover/ reveal trauma.&nbsp; Revelling trauma or bias crosses the creepy line.&nbsp; The creepy line is a very subjective idea and is different for everyone.&nbsp; When I published “<a href="https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/">My Digital Footprint</a>” back in 2009, I wrote a lot about the creepy line where data collection can be the same, but how you present the data back to the user will either add value or unnerve them.&nbsp; But to know what a user will accept, you test the user's concepts of a creepy line continually to find out when what you are saying becomes unacceptable and back off — deep personalisation.&nbsp; The creepy line and the concepts of privacy are deeply interlinked.&nbsp; Privacy is linked to perceptions of risk, and risk acceptance or adversity equally links to trauma and bias.</p><p>Bias, trauma, risk and privacy matter at both levels, macro and micro, but that is a big rabbit hole where we get into identity, but I am interested here in decision-making.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>What I am left questioning is whether understanding bias is the right thing to do. Conceptually should we spend more time understanding if this bias feeds something OR if this bias is fed by something OR both?&nbsp; Would both provide new insights to help us give the user better choices and make better decisions, or are we edging toward influence and control and, in doing so, remove agency?</p><br><p>&nbsp;CEO Take Away</p><p>Trauma and bias are critical to decision-making. In the board room and leadership executive setting, should we unpack bias and ignore trauma? &nbsp; Bias is easy to talk about, trauma remains “unsaid” - I am not even sure if we assume.&nbsp; The point is, can we use bias as a proxy? Knowing that many CEO’s and founders are driven by trauma, is understanding bias going to take us to a place that will be easier or more difficult to talk about how we make decisions?</p><p>Worth reading <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1048984322000212">CEO childhood trauma, social networks, and strategic risk-taking</a></p><br><p>&nbsp;</p><br><br><br><p>Further reading&nbsp;</p>  <p>CEO early-life disaster experience and corporate social performance <br><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/smj.3293">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/smj.3293</a></p>  <p>CEO Traits and Firm Outcomes: Do Early Childhood Experiences Matter?<br><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3374389">https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3374389</a></p>  <p>The Indirect Effect of Trauma via Cognitive Biases and Self-Disturbances on Psychotic-Like Experiences<br><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.611069/full">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.611069/full</a></p>  <p>Childhood trauma and cognitive biases associated with psychosis: A systematic review and meta-analysis <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7906349/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7906349/</a>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Enhanced Attentional Bias Variability in Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and its Relationship to More General Impairments in Cognitive Control <br><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-15226-7">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-15226-7</a>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Unconscious Cultural Bias Reduction and Trauma-Informed Care <a href="https://www.careinnovations.org/resources/unconscious-cultural-bias-reduction/">https://www.careinnovations.org/resources/unconscious-cultural-bias-reduction/</a></p>  <p>Attention Bias and Metacogniti on: Relationships with Childhood Trauma and Psychological Vulnerability<br><a href="https://research.manchester.ac.uk/files/205623245/FULL_TEXT.PDF">https://research.manchester.ac.uk/files/205623245/FULL_TEXT.PDF</a></p>  <p>Interpretation biases in victims and non-victims of interpersonal trauma and their relation to symptom development <br><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0887618506001332">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0887618506001332</a></p>  <p>Recall Bias in Trauma Recollection <br><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/355928917_Recall_Bias_in_Trauma_Recollection">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/355928917_Recall_Bias_in_Trauma_Recollection</a></p>  <br><br><br><br>

On a recent episode of <a href="https://www.buzzsprout.com/1112270/11934167-baby-jessica-with-blair-braverman">You’re Wrong About</a>, Sarah Marshall delivered a crisp summary of how the 24-hour news cycle came to be. This led me to realize that many among us do not remember when news was confined to time slots: the 7 o’clock news, the 11 o’clock news, the morning paper. I think it might be healthy to bring that back in some form. From the excitement I heard in their voices I gather that Sarah Marshall and her co-presenter Blair Braverman feel the same way. When I hear people complain about Mastodon’s lack of breaking news, I think: “Feature, not bug!” Maybe what the 24-hour cycle has been breaking is us.</p>
<p>
So when <a href="https://press.coop/">press.coop</a> launched today I was a bit conflicted. On the one hand, I would like to use Mastodon to read mainstream news headlines just as I once used RSS to do. (Full disclosure: press.coop is run as a public service by <a href="https://hello.coop">hello.coop</a> whose founder, Dick Hardt, is a longtime friend.) On the other hand, when reading Mastodon timelines I’m enjoying NOT knowing what’s happening in the world right now.</p>
<p>
What if you could exclude news from the home timeline, put it on a list, and go there when — and only when — in a news mindset? That’s a feature of <a href="https://fedilab.app/">the Fedilab client</a>, I learned from <a href="https://twit.social/@ksoltys">Keith Soltys</a>. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/press-coop.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>
What would it take to implement the same idea in the Mastodon reader I’m developing? It couldn’t be just an extra WHERE condition, could it?</p>
<p>
Well, actually, it could.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/news-exclude-timeline.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>
Problem solved. Now I can read news in Mastodon when and how I want, and never see it otherwise.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/mastodon-news-list.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>
If you want that same control, you shouldn’t have to use a particular Android client, or Steampipe client, or any other. There’s a Cambrian explosion of such creatures right now. The more they can share important DNA, the better for all of us.</p>
<p>
I hope that the Steampipe plugin for Mastodon, which enables the dashboards I’m building using Steampipe’s own <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3668032/visualizing-the-hacker-news-api-with-hcl-and-sql.html">dashboards-as-code</a> system, can provide some useful common DNA. A rule like news only on lists, not timelines, once expressed in SQL, can be used (and thus not reinvented) by any kind of Steampipe (read: Postgres) client: psql (or any Postgres CLI), Metabase or Tableau or any Postgres-compatible BI tool, Python or JavaScript or any programming language. Steampipe is a versatile <a href="https://steampipe.io/blog/steampipe-as-component">component</a>. Its mapping from APIs to SQL can, in theory, provide the data layer for any application. </p>
<p>
My Steampipe + Mastodon adventure notwithstanding, let’s hold on to that larger idea. The fediverse is our chance to reboot the social web and gain control of our information diets. Since our diets all differ, it ought to be trivial for anyone — in any client — to turn on a rule like news only on lists, not timelines. I’ve shown one way it can be trivial. Please show me others!</p>

<p>This post shows how to implement a Blazor WASM UI hosted in an ASP.NET Core application using multiple identity providers to authenticate. Two confidential OpenID Connect code flow clients with PKCE are used to implement the Blazor authentication. The Blazor WASM and the ASP.NET Core application are a single security context. This is implemented using the backend for frontend security architecture.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/ApiJwtWithTwoSts">https://github.com/damienbod/ApiJwtWithTwoSts</a></p>



 Setup 



<p>Two identity providers are implemented using OpenIddict with ASP.NET Core Identity. Any OpenID Connect identity provider can be used here. The identity provider implements a confidential client requiring a secret. The OpenID Connect code flow is used to implement the authentication flow.</p>







<p><br>The Blazor application was setup using the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Blazor.BFF.OpenIDConnect.Template">Blazor.BFF.OpenIDConnect.Template</a> which can be installed and used from Visual Studio or the dotnet cmd tool. The template creates an ASP.NET Core application with a WASM view and default definitions for OIDC code flow.</p>



 Blazor authentication 



<p>The Blazor applicaiton requires two OIDC client implementations. The user of the application can choose the required IDP. The DefaultChallengeScheme is set to “UNKNOWN” and this has no definition. The login or sign-in needs to set the authentication scheme for the challenge. The redirect Url and the logout URL needs to be explicitly set and cannot match a definition from a different challenge.</p>


  services.AddAuthentication(options =&gt;
{
    options.DefaultScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    options.DefaultChallengeScheme = "UNKNOWN";
})
.AddCookie()
.AddOpenIdConnect("T1", options =&gt;
{
    configuration.GetSection("OpenIDConnectSettingsT1").Bind(options);

    options.SignInScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    options.CallbackPath = "/signin-oidc-t1";
    options.SignedOutCallbackPath = "/signout-callback-oidc-t1";
    options.ResponseType = OpenIdConnectResponseType.Code;
    options.SaveTokens = true;
    options.Scope.Add("profile");
    options.GetClaimsFromUserInfoEndpoint = true;
    options.TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
    {
        NameClaimType = "name",
        RoleClaimType = "role"
    };
})
.AddOpenIdConnect("T2", options =&gt;
{
    configuration.GetSection("OpenIDConnectSettingsT2").Bind(options);

    options.SignInScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    options.ResponseType = OpenIdConnectResponseType.Code;
    options.CallbackPath = "/signin-oidc-t2";
    options.SignedOutCallbackPath = "/signout-callback-oidc-t2";
    options.SaveTokens = true;
    options.Scope.Add("profile");
    options.GetClaimsFromUserInfoEndpoint = true;
    options.TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
    {
        NameClaimType = "name",
        RoleClaimType = "role"
    };
});
  


<p></p>



<p>The AccountController implements the login and the logout requests. The login needs to force the login for the correct scheme. I named my schemes T1 and T2.</p>


  [HttpGet("LoginT1")]
public IActionResult T1(string returnUrl)
{
	var redirectUrl = !string.IsNullOrEmpty(returnUrl) ? returnUrl : "/";
	return Challenge(new AuthenticationProperties 
		{ RedirectUri = redirectUrl }, "T1");
}

[HttpGet("LoginT2")]
public IActionResult T2(string returnUrl)
{
	var redirectUrl = !string.IsNullOrEmpty(returnUrl) ? returnUrl : "/";
	return Challenge(new AuthenticationProperties 
		{ RedirectUri = redirectUrl }, "T2");
}
  


<p></p>



<p>The CallbackPath needs to be unique in the application and a separated definition is required for each identity provider.</p>



 Blazor client logout 



<p>The logout works a bit like the login. You need to have a unique SignedOutCallbackPath definition for each scheme. I added a new claim to the id_token token from the identity provider. I added this claim in the OpenIddict server. Once the user is authenticated, the idp claim can used to verify which identity provider was used for authentication. The claim is required to logout which sends a request to the correct identity provider.</p>


  [ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
[Authorize]
[HttpPost("Logout")]
public IActionResult Logout()
{
	var authProperties = new AuthenticationProperties
	{
		RedirectUri = "/"
	};

	// custom claims added to idp, you need to 
	// implement something on your idp for this
	var usedT1ForAuthn = User.Claims.Any(
		idpClaim =&gt; idpClaim.Type == "idp" &amp;&amp; idpClaim.Value == "T1");
	var usedT2ForAuthn = User.Claims.Any(
		idpClaim =&gt; idpClaim.Type == "idp" &amp;&amp; idpClaim.Value == "T2");

	if(usedT1ForAuthn) 
		return SignOut(authProperties, 
		CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme, "T1");

	if (usedT2ForAuthn)
		return SignOut(authProperties, 
		CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme, "T2");

	return SignOut(authProperties, 
	CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme);
}
  


<p></p>



<p>The custom “idp” is also used to display identity provider in the Blazor WASM UI.</p>


  &lt;Authorized&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;@context?.User?.Identity?.Name idp: 
		@context?.User?.Claims.FirstOrDefault(c =&gt; c.Type == "idp")?.Value
	&lt;/strong&gt;
	&lt;form method="post" action="api/Account/Logout"&gt;
		&lt;AntiForgeryTokenInput /&gt;
		&lt;button class="btn btn-link" type="submit"&gt;Signout&lt;/button&gt;
	&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/Authorized&gt;
  


<p>The user can login using different identity providers.</p>







<p></p>



<p>The name claim and the identity provider are displayed in the UI.</p>







<p></p>



 Notes 



<p>Using multiple identity providers in ASP.NET Core is a simple implementation once you understand the scheme concept and the authentication flow events used. If using the one line wrappers authentication clients from the different providers, you need to override the default implementation hidden inside these libraries. Most of these packages provide extension methods and contracts for this, but sometimes it is more simple to use the standard ASP.NET Core implementation. This works for any conform OpenID Connect server.</p>

A chatbot answering complex life questions sitting on a mountain — DALL·E&nbsp;2<p>From ChatGPT:</p><p>Digital identity is a complex issue that has not been fully solved due to several challenges and obstacles, some of which&nbsp;include:</p>  Privacy concerns: Digital identity often requires the collection and storage of personal information, which raises privacy concerns and the risk of data breaches. There is a need for a solution that can provide secure and reliable identity verification while also protecting the privacy of individuals.  Interoperability: There are many different systems and protocols for digital identity management, which can make it difficult for these systems to work together seamlessly. This can lead to compatibility issues and difficulties in accessing and sharing information across different platforms and organizations.  Trust and Security: Establishing trust and security in digital identity systems is crucial, as fraudulent activities and identity theft can have serious consequences for both individuals and organizations. Ensuring that digital identity systems are secure and resistant to hacking and fraud requires ongoing investment in research and development.  Regulation: Digital identity is a global issue and different countries have different laws and regulations around data privacy and identity management. This can make it difficult to develop a standardized and universal solution for digital identity.    Technical Complexity: Digital identity involves multiple technologies, such as cryptography, biometrics, and machine learning, which can make it challenging to create a solution that is both secure and user-friendly.  <p>Despite these challenges, there has been progress made in recent years to solve these problems and create more secure and user-friendly digital identity solutions. However, this is an ongoing process that requires collaboration between technology companies, governments, and other stakeholders.</p>

  Installing Ubuntu on a 2010 era iMac hardware

<p>I use a 2010 era 27” iMac as my primary home desktop computer. I have become increasingly frustrated by my inability to update the macOS to versions that support security and privacy features such as Apple’s Advanced Data Protection for iCloud. So I decided to install Ubuntu (Linux) in a dual-boot configuration on this hardware.</p>

<p></p>



<p>As I was researching whether this was even possible, I ran into sometimes conflicting, many times outdated, and often incomplete information, so wanted to document both my configuration and the resources that were helpful to me in the hope that others don’t have to go through much of the uncertainty that I felt when I decided to go down this road.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>TL;DR - Installing Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS (Jammy Jellifish) in a dual boot configuration with macOS High Sierra Version 10.13.6 on a 27” iMac 11,3 (Mid 2010) hardware with an Intel Core i3 CPU was a painless experience and, as of right now, I have been happily running this configuration as my primary home desktop computer with zero problems for close to 3 weeks.</p>
</blockquote>

 Apple hardware 

<p>I like the iMac hardware.</p>

<p>It is clean, does not take up much space, and has been running trouble-free for me since I bought it back in 2010. The following is my hardware configuration:</p>

 ❖ Model Name: iMac (27-inch, Mid 2010)
    ▻ Model Identifier:  iMac11,3
❖ Processor Name: Intel Core i3
    ▻ Processor Speed:  3.2 GHz
    ▻ Number of Processors:  1
    ▻ Total Number of Cores:  2
    ▻ L2 Cache (per Core):  256 KB
    ▻ L3 Cache:  4 MB
❖ Memory:  16 GB 1333 MHz DDR3
❖ Graphics:  ATI Radeon HD 5670 512 MB
❖ Storage:  1 TB SATA Disk
 

<p>It is also connected to the following external peripherals:</p>

 ❖ Dell 27" Monitor (U2719DC)
❖ USB connected Keychron V10 (Alice Layout) QMK Custom Mechanical Keyboard
❖ USB connected Logitech G203 Prodigy Gaming Mouse
❖ Hard line network connection  
 

<p>I am calling out the mention of the keyboard, mouse and network connection as being hard-wired because in my research, the typical complaints regarding the installation of Linux on Apple hardware was related to WiFi network connections and Bluetooth keyboards and mice.</p>

<p>My recommendation to de-complexify your installation would be to ensure that you use hard-line connected devices during the installation phase and once everything is done, swap in your regular devices (My WiFi and Bluetooth are working just fine under Ubuntu; I just don’t use it.)</p>

 Why Ubuntu LTS? 

<p>My selection criteria for a Linux distribution was the following:</p>

 
   It should be stable and it should just work; nothing flashy or fancy 
   When a software or hardware vendor says that it “Supports Linux”, the chosen distribution should be at the top of that list 
   There should be an automated security and maintenance update process 
   Excellent documentation and community support 
   Application support for the majority of my day to day activities, ideally with Linux versions of the same applications 
 

<p>Ubuntu LTS met all of those requirements for me.</p>

<p>In particular the LTS version of Ubuntu which “… stands for long-term support — which means five years of free security and maintenance updates, guaranteed until April 2027” was a make or break selection criteria for me.</p>

 Installation steps 

<p>I spent a substantial amount of time looking thru installation guides on the inter-webs and the best one that I found, and which I used for my installation, was Dan Helyer’s <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/install-linux-macbook-pro/" title="How to Install and Dual Boot Linux on Your Mac">How to Install and Dual Boot Linux on Your Mac</a>. It is well written, with lots of screen shots, and step-by-step instructions that worked very well for me.</p>

<p>I am not going to replicate that here, but instead provide some notes regarding my experience:</p>

 
   This process will not work on Apple Silicon iMacs 
   I followed the dual-boot installation steps 
   The drive partitioning step was an overnight process for me (I allocated 500GB of my 1TB SATA drive to a combination of OS and swap partitions) 
   I did not use the USB installer, but instead simply <a href="https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/burn-a-dvd-on-macos#1-overview" title="How to burn a DVD on macOS">burned the Ubuntu ISO onto a DVD</a> and used that instead 
 

<p>Everything else simply just worked, which I think is a testament to the maturity and polish of the Ubuntu distribution.</p>

 Post-installation configuration 

<p>There were only three steps that were specific to my environment.</p>

 
   
    <p>I use a NAS within my home network to keep content across my various devices synchronized and as my private git server and backup infrastructure. It is then set up to perform regular, automated and encrypted off-site archival of that content. So I simply had to install that client agent on my new system and point it to my internal NAS for all my content to be come back to my new machine. That was an overnight process.</p>
   
   
    <p>By default, Ubuntu uses the bash shell and I prefer the zsh shell. That is a personal preference; I had also spent far too much time getting my terminal “just so” on my mac and did not feel like redoing all that with bash. So I installed zsh and copied the config files that I was using on the iMac over, and everything just came back the way I wanted it to look.</p>
   
   
    <p>My mechanical keyboard supports open source software that allows for a significant amount of customization. So I spent some time looking at the <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/stable/ubuntu-help/shell-keyboard-shortcuts.html.en" title="Ubuntu keyboard shortcuts">keyboard shortcuts available under Ubuntu</a> to remap some of my keys, and create some macros to assign to the custom keys on the keyboard to make my day-to-day tasks a bit easier.</p>
   
 

 Future steps 

<p>I am rather happy with how this turned out, and the new life that my iMac hardware is enjoying.</p>

<p>The one thing I am currently researching is how best to add a fingerprint sensor for both authentication to the local machine as well as a pathway to support Passkeys/FIDO2/WebAuthn. Currently reading about and looking into the YubiKey Bio as a possible way to enable this support.</p>

<p>I hope that my experience and pointers prove useful to other folks who are being given not so subtle signals by the vendor that their hardware has reached end-of-life. The reality is that it has not, and you have very good options available to you to continue using the hardware which is working just fine!</p>

  For the first time, there is now a native JSON Web Token (JWT) representation for Verifiable Credentials. This representation uses IANA-registered JWT claims whenever applicable. Among other improvements and simplifications, this means that we finally have a Verifiable Credentials representation that doesn’t require the use of JSON-LD. The native JWT representation explicitly isn’t a mapping […]

<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/"></a>For the first time, there is now a native JSON Web Token (JWT) representation for Verifiable Credentials.  This representation uses IANA-registered JWT claims whenever applicable.  Among other improvements and simplifications, this means that we finally have a Verifiable Credentials representation that doesn’t require the use of JSON-LD.</p>
<p>The native JWT representation explicitly isn’t a mapping from the VC Data Model.  This mapping in the VC 1.1 specification resulted in ambiguities about whether to duplicate VC Data Model claims in the VC-JWT representation (the “in addition to” option) or whether to delete them from the VC Data Model representation (the “instead of” option).  These ambiguities harmed interoperability.  Rather, the 2.0 VC-JWT representation is its own simpler native JWT data structure.</p>
<p>See the new native JWT VC representation in the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-jwt/#version-2">Version 2 section of the “Securing Verifiable Credentials using JSON Web Tokens” specification</a>.  You can also compare it there to the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-jwt/#version-1.1">Version 1.1 representation</a>, which is a mapping from the VC Data Model with the “in addition to” and “instead of” choices.</p>
<p>This accomplishment is the product of the vision, passion, and perseverance of many advocates of simplifying Verifiable Credentials.  Foremost among them is <a href="https://twitter.com/OR13b">Orie Steele</a> – my co-editor for the VC-JWT specification.  I’ll also observe that the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/vc-jwt/pull/44">pull request creating this functionality</a> had an unprecedented fifteen approvers – an indication of the broad support for this direction for Verifiable Credentials.  I am proud to have played a role in making it happen.</p>

<p><a href="https://tidbits.com/author/glenn-fleishman/">Glenn Fleishman</a> has a lucid and helpful <a href="https://tidbits.com/2023/01/27/mastodon-a-new-hope-for-social-networking">introduction</a> to Mastodon in TidBITS that opens with this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Cast your mind back to the first time you experienced joy and wonder on the Internet. Do you worry you’ll never be able to capture that sense again? If so, it’s worth wading gently into the world of Mastodon microblogging to see if it offers something fresh and delightful. It might remind you—as it does me, at least for now—of the days when you didn’t view online interactions with some level of dread.</p>
<p>Mastodon isn’t a service but a network of consensually affiliated, independently operated servers running the Mastodon software. It’s the best-known example of the so-called Fediverse…</p></blockquote>
<p>Then, a few paragraphs later, he provides the best metaphor I’ve yet seen for what Mastodon is and how it works:</p>
<blockquote><p>You can think of Mastodon as a flotilla of boats of vastly different sizes, whereas Twitter is like being on a cruise ship the size of a continent. Some Mastodon boats might be cruise liners with as many as 50,000 passengers; others are just dinghies with a single occupant! The admin of each instance—the captain of your particular boat—might make arbitrary decisions you disagree with as heartily as with any commercial operator’s tacks and turns. But you’re not stuck on your boat, with abandoning ship as the only alternative. Instead, you can hop from one boat to another without losing your place in the flotilla community. Parts of a flotilla can also splinter off and form their own disconnected groups, but no boat, however large, is in charge of the community.</p></blockquote>
<p>Since my day job is working as a visiting scholar in the <a href="https://ostromworkshop.indiana.edu/">Ostrom Workshop</a> at Indiana University, and <a href="http://customercommons.org">Customer Commons</a> has been imagined from its start as a potential commons for customers (or as many commons, flotilla style), I find myself wondering if each of Mastodon’s boats is a commons. Or if some of them could be, or already are. Or if Mastodon itself is one.</p>
<p>My first experience with Mastodon came early on, in a boat that I abandoned before it sank. But now that Mastodon is hot again, I’ve jumped with two crowds onto two boats: <a href="https://twit.social/">twit.social</a>&nbsp;(<a href="https://twit.social/@dsearls">here</a>) and <a>journa.host</a>&nbsp;(<a href="https://journa.host/@dsearls">here</a>). TWiT.social’s occupants are the community of hosts, co-hosts, and participants in the <a href="https://twit.tv">TWiT network</a>. Journa.host’s occupants are a collection of journalists. The two communities are different, though not entirely: journalists abound in both of them.</p>
<p>The question for me here is if any of these boats qualify as a commons. Or if Mastodon itself is one.</p>
<p>To qualify as a commons, a canonical list to check off is provided by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom">Elinor Ostrom</a>. In&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/governing-the-commons/A8BB63BC4A1433A50A3FB92EDBBB97D5">Governing the Commons</a>&nbsp;(Cambridge, 1990), she outlined eight “design principles” for stable local common pool resource (CPR) management. I’ll make notes following each in italics:</p>
 
 Clearly defining the group boundaries (and effective exclusion of external un-entitled parties) and the contents of the common pool resource.&nbsp;Mastodon is designed to support that. 
 The appropriation and provision of common resources that are adapted to local conditions.&nbsp;If we’re talking about code, yes. Maybe more. Gotta think about that. 
 Collective-choice arrangements that allow most resource appropriators to participate in the decision-making process. Depends on the instance, I suppose.&nbsp; 
 Effective monitoring by monitors who are part of or accountable to the appropriators.&nbsp;Not sure about that one.&nbsp; 
 A scale of graduated sanctions for resource appropriators who violate community rules.&nbsp;Up to the person or people running each boat. 
 Mechanisms of conflict resolution that are cheap and of easy access.&nbsp;I think these range from informal to formal, and draw from rules developed for mailing lists and other fora. But, not sure. 
 Self-determination of the community recognized by higher-level authorities.&nbsp;At the top level, it’s othe Mastodon dev community. At the boat (instance) level, it’s the captain(s) of each. 
 In the case of larger common-pool resources, organization in the form of multiple layers of nested enterprises, with small local CPRs (common pool resources) at the base level.&nbsp;A thought: the common pool resource is the authors of posts (aka toots) and the posts themselves. 
 
<p>Ostrom and others have also gone deeper and wider than that, for example by examining socio-ecological systems (SESes), <a href="https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol9/iss1/art18/">defined here</a> in 2004. I’ll leave digging into that up to scholars more schooled than I (or to a later post, after I finish schooling myself). Meanwhile, I think it’s important, given the sudden growth of Mastodon and other federated systems with flotilla-ish qualities, to examine how deep research and writing on commons apply.</p>
<p>This work does matter: Ostrom <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2009/ostrom/facts/">won a Nobel Prize</a> for it, and it may matter more now than ever.</p>
<p>And help is welcome.</p>
 
<p>About the photo up top: Lacking a royalty-free visual for a flotilla of boats, I settled on the collections of people you see through bubbles in the photo above, which I shot on the grounds of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Versailles,_Yvelines">Versailles</a>. Kinda works, methinks.</p>

<p>
The Fediverse is wired together by protocols like <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">ActivityPub</a> and <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7033">WebFinger</a> which, as yet, I know very little about. That’s because the Steampipe plugin, which supports the dashboards I’ve been building and describing in this series, doesn’t require me to understand or use those protocols. </p>
<p>
It does, however, require me to understand and use the <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/client/intro/">Mastodon API</a>. Mostly I use that API by way of the <a href="https://github.com/mattn/go-mastodon">Go SDK for Mastodon</a> (thanks, mattn!), sometimes I make REST calls directly. Either way, my read-only dashboards use a fairly small subset of the Mastodon API. The full API is quite broad and deep; it enables API clients to read from and write to Mastodon servers in all sorts of ways. Here are the chapters of the Mastodon API book: <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/apps/">apps</a>, <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/accounts/">accounts</a>, <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/admin/">admin</a>, <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/instance/">instance</a>, <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/search/">search</a>, <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/statuses/">statuses</a>, <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/timelines/">timelines</a>, <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/notifications/">notifications</a>, <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/oembed/">oembed</a>. These chapters define what’s common to all Mastodon clients, including web apps, phone apps, native OS apps, and Steampipe dashboards.</p>
<p>
So far I’ve ignored protocol-enabled interop in order to focus on API-enabled interop. I’m aware that the Fediverse includes much more than just Mastodon. I intend to explore BookWrym, Friendica, Funkwhale, Lemmy, takahe, PeerTube, Pixelfed, PeerTube, and others in due time. But right now the Mastodon ecosystem is plenty to try to wrap my head around.</p>
<p>
For example, there’s a new web client for Mastodon: <a href="https://elk.zone">elk.zone</a>. With the recent addition of support for lists, it has become my favorite way to interact in Mastodon space. So naturally I wanted to be able to click through from Steampipe dashboards to Elk, and use it as an alternative to the batteries-included Mastodon web app.</p>
<p>
It turned out to be easy to enable that integration. Not thanks to ActivityPub, and not even thanks to the API. It works thanks to a third level of interop at play: common patterns for account URLs and toot URLs. </p>
<p>
Here’s the account URL for Ward Cunningham who hangs his shingle at mastodon.radio: <a href="https://mastodon.radio/@k9ox">https://mastodon.radio/@k9ox</a>. But as we saw in <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2022/12/31/instance-qualified-mastodon-urls/">instance-qualified Mastodon URLs</a>, if you visit that URL directly — and if it’s not your home server — you can’t follow Ward there, or add him to a list. You’ll need to copy that URL, paste it into your home server’s search box, run the search, and arrive at an instance-qualified URL where you can follow him or add him to a list: <a href="https://mastodon.social/@k9ox@mastodon.radio">https://mastodon.social/@k9ox@mastodon.radio</a>. If you’re home is fosstodon.org this would instead be <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@k9ox@mastodon.radio">https://fosstodon.org/@k9ox@mastodon.radio</a>.</p>
<p>
Similarly here is one of Ward’s toots at mastodon.radio: <a href="https://mastodon.radio/@k9ox/109802968820955379">https://mastodon.radio/@k9ox/109802968820955379</a>. If you want to reply or boost or favorite, you can’t do it there. The URL you need is again one that routes through your home server: <a href="https://mastodon.social/@k9ox@mastodon.radio/109802969999396562">https://mastodon.social/@k9ox@mastodon.radio/109802969999396562</a>. Note that the ids for the same toot differ! That difference surprised me and some others, and is a topic for another episode. Here I’ll just note that these two patterns govern how we interact when crossing server boundaries in Mastodon space using the stock web client.</p>
<p>
When I started using Elk, another layer of pattern emerged. Here are those same URLs in Elk:</p>
<p>
<a href="https://elk.zone/mastodon.social/@k9ox@mastodon.radio">https://elk.zone/mastodon.social/@k9ox@mastodon.radio</a></p>
<p>
<a href="https://elk.zone/mastodon.social/@k9ox@mastodon.radio/109802969999396562">https://elk.zone/mastodon.social/@k9ox@mastodon.radio/109802969999396562</a></p>
<p>
As it turns out, I just needed to make two of the Steampipe plugin’s transform functions prepend elk.zone to the instance-qualified URLs, then make such prefixing a configuration option. Now when I visit Mastodon links from dashboards, to reply or boost or follow or enlist, I land in the Elk experience that I prefer.</p>
<p>
ActivityPub and WebFinger are formal standards. I would describe the Mastodon API as a de-facto standard. But this prefixing maneuver is just a convention. It’s not guaranteed to work with another web client, and not even guaranteed to work across all URLs presented by the stock Mastodon client. That’s OK by me. Conventions are incredibly useful. The Twitter hashtag is just a convention, after all, inspired in turn by an <a href="https://factoryjoe.com/2007/08/25/groups-for-twitter-or-a-proposal-for-twitter-tag-channels/">IRC convention</a>. </p>
<p>
We’re in one of those Internet moments of rapid innovation, when new conventions can unlock emergent behaviors. It hadn’t even occurred to me that the Steampipe dashboards could support Elk. A few hours after I thought they might, they did. I’ve seen this kind of thing before, perhaps most notably when the blogosophere adopted &lt;link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" href="{feedUrl}"&gt; to enable browsers to auto-discover RSS feeds. That happened about 20 years ago, and quite suddenly when a handful of leading blogging tools adopted the convention in a matter of days. It was a lot of fun to live through that era. If you missed it, enjoy the sequel that’s unfolding now!</p>

<p>The digital wallet is the killer app for the completely open source hardware and software “digital mobile safe” program led by mudge (aka Peiter) Zatko, at Google’s Advanced Technologies and Projects (ATAP) Group back in 2015. We need it today!</p>



<p>Digital wallets are core to enabling individual agency and control over sensitive data in online and offline interactions. In many ways, the European Union is leading this charge with the <a title="Orchestrating an ecosystem">massive identity ecosystem orchestration they are currently in the midst of.</a></p>

<p>At the same time, to ensure that wallets truly remain under individual control we must pay attention to <a title="Whose wallet is it anyway?">choices being made in its development such that the future does not become a collection of proprietary vertical cylinders of excellence (silos)</a>, and that <a title="Asymmetric wallet wars">individuals have true choice in how and when they select wallets</a> for their personal use.</p>

<p>However, there is a curious but important missing element in all of these digital wallet conversations; everyone talks about protocols to interact with a wallet and what should or should not be stored in a wallet, but there is little to no discussion about ensuring the openness, consistency and fidelity of the core security, privacy, cryptographic and storage aspects that a wallet actually needs!</p>

 Common need across digital wallets 

<p>Let us fast forward in time to understand what is needed:</p>

 
   
    <p>I am an EU Citizen with a EU Digital Identity (EUDI) Wallet who is seeking to live and work in the US. I need to interact with the US Government to provide information about who I am, and at the end of that process receive some manner of immigration or work permit related credential. Since I already have an EUDI Wallet, I would like provide information to the USG from that wallet and in turn continue to use that wallet to store any immigration credential I get from the USG.</p>
   
   
    <p>I am a Canadian who is looking to live and work in the EU and when seeking employment there would like to use the digital wallet from my Province that stores my identity information as well as education credentials. My potential employer supports, per EU regulation, the ability to consume these credentials in a digital form.</p>
   
   
    <p>Following upon both of the above scenarios, I would like to open a bank account using my digital wallet to present the needed information for KYC.</p>
   
 

<p>There are so many more variations of this that span the public and private sector, as well as a variety and combinations of credentials.</p>

<p>The commonality across ALL of them is not the credentials, or the protocols, but the underlying foundation and “trustability” of the digital wallet itself by a counter-party. Everything else is pipes and payloads.</p>

<p>And that, to my mind, is what the Google ATAP Project Vault showed could be done in a completely open manner, such that you can actually have independently verifiable confidence in that wallet when it shows up at your digital front door.</p>

 Google ATAP Project Vault 

<p>I would highly recommend folks watching the video below, which includes both a great introduction by Regina Dugan (formerly the first female director of DARPA) as well as the overview and demo of the capability by mudge.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So the question is, why build this [...]</p>
<p>It turns out, you already have security elements in your phones and your computers. SIM Cards; they protect the things that are important to the carriers. Trusted platform modules, or TPMs;  they protect the things that are important to the OEMs and the content providers. [...]</p>
<p>So, where is the security element that protects the things that are important to you, that you have complete control over? So we made one!</p>
<p>[...] So what do developers have to do to get the phones or laptops or IOT devices ready to use Project Vault? Nothing! The host system thinks this is a regular storage device.</p>
mudge
</blockquote>

 
  
 

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/mpbWQbkl8_g?t=2845">Link to Project Vault YouTube video</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As <a title="Parenting the future of technology">I wrote back in 2015:</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Project Vault is a micro-SD form-factor card that, when plugged into a device, makes available to the device a suite of cryptographic tools to enable hashing, signing, bulk encryption, streaming encryption as well as a strong hardware random number generator.</p>

  <p>The algorithms in the vault are not exposed to the host system so you can plug it into an untrusted device while being confident that the host system will not be able to corrupt the vault’s crypto services.</p>

  <p>It also comes with 4GB of isolated, sealed storage which can be used for enabling capabilities such as an immutable logging system where evidence of malicious activity cannot be covered up by tampering with the logs.</p>

  <p>It is operating system agnostic, so will work with a variety of both mobile and desktop operating systems. To the OS it behaves like a proc file system without any kernel drivers, which means that developers don’t have to do anything special in order to utilize it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The one change I would hope for in any current day implementation “… is a Security Key form-factor with USB-C …” because <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/society/20220413STO27211/usb-type-c-to-become-eu-s-common-charger-by-end-of-2024" title="USB-type C to become EU's common charger by end of 2024">USB-type C is mandated to become EU’s standard by the end of 2024</a>, and where the EU is leading with that, the world will follow.</p>

 Opportunity for personal, truly open digital wallets 

<p>There is a clear opportunity here to implement an open source hardware(!) and software foundation (the vault) to enable secure and interoperable wallets that can be used for a variety of purposes, that truly remains under the control of an individual.</p>

<p>However, for anyone going down this path, what will become critical to their success is what they choose not to do rather than what they actually do.</p>

<p>In order to provide a truly open foundation for a digital wallet that is under the personal control of an individual, it will require them to:</p>

 
   keep the focus on enhancing and making production ready the foundational vault capabilities to support hardened, accelerated cryptographic operations and secure storage that are needed for any type of digital wallet 
   build well documented APIs to interact with the core vault services that are open, royalty free and free to implement for anyone 
   think through how best to put into place an independent assessment/verification mechanism with a high degree of transparency and credibility that allows counter-parties to assess the “goodness” of an implementation 
 

<p>I anticipate that the hardest challenges here will not be technical, but instead will be to:</p>

 
   resist the pressure from handset and platform vendors who will seek to influence the work in a manner such that the capabilities being externalized into the vault continue to be gatekeeper’d by them 
   resist the use of platform or vendor specific hardware security elements instead of the open source externalized hardware security elements demonstrated by Project Vault 
   resist getting dragged into the political infighting around directly implementing the variety of credential types or credential issuance and presentation protocols directly in the vault; it should be the responsibility of those specific communities to define and standardize how their protocols can utilize the open platform and vendor neutral vault APIs. 
 

 Building on an open source foundation 

<p>I have no visibility into or awareness of what happened with Project Vault after mudge moved on from Google ATAP. What I do believe is that he, particularly given his prior stint at DARPA, looked around the corner for what was coming, drove the work that was needed to be ready for that future, and made sure it was as widely available as possible by making it entirely open source!</p>

<p>That is a gift that should not be wasted!</p>

 

 <a></a>newRecently: Commons are not tragic 

<p><a href="https://aeon.co/essays/the-tragedy-of-the-commons-is-a-false-and-dangerous-myth" title="The miracle of the commons">Elinor Ostrom, the first woman to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences, debunks the “Tragedy of the Commons”</a> which posits that “Humans, when left to their own devices, compete with one another for resources until the resources run out.”</p>

<p>Her research revealed that “Far from being profoundly destructive, we humans have deep capacities for sharing resources with generosity and foresight.”</p>

<p>The features of successful systems, Ostrom and her colleagues found, include:</p>

 
   
    <p>clear boundaries (the ‘community’ doing the managing must be well-defined);</p>
   
   
    <p>reliable monitoring of the shared resource;</p>
   
   
    <p>a reasonable balance of costs and benefits for participants;</p>
   
   
    <p>a predictable process for the fast and fair resolution of conflicts;</p>
   
   
    <p>an escalating series of punishments for cheaters;</p>
   
   
    <p>and good relationships between the community and other layers of authority, from household heads to international institutions.</p>
   
 

<p>This has implications for and provides hope to those who are building and investing in the “Internet Commons”.</p>

Instead, a royalty-free patent policy was created so that people who use patents covering technologies in their standards don’t have to pay royalties or fees. Other standards development organizations have since copied this over the years since it was developed in the early 2000s.”</p>

<p>
I began this journey convinced that Steampipe could help the Fediverse evolve, but not sure exactly how. My first thought was to use Steampipe’s <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3648648/how-sql-can-unify-access-to-apis.html">API-wrangling superpower</a> to study patterns of communication (and conflict) across the Fediverse. But as one of many Twitter escapees last November, I soon realized that the network I was joining reflected a culture that had been humming along nicely for six years and didn’t particularly want to be the object of sociological study.</p>
<p>
As I argued in <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2022/11/28/autonomy-packet-size-friction-fanout-and-velocity/">Autonomy, packet size, friction, fanout, and velocity</a>, Mastodon bakes in certain kinds of friction for reasons. You’ve likely heard about a default unfriendliness to search, which is both a technical setting and a cultural choice that privileges the experience of current flow over the mining of past flow. Even more fundamentally, the ID of a toot not only differs from server to server but also obfuscates the toot’s date, another technical/cultural choice that means you can’t randomly access history by date. None of these frictions is insurmountable. They will be overcome for purposes good and bad. I hope and expect that communities will be able to choose their desired amounts and kinds of friction while still interoperating with others. But for my project it seemed that trying to survey the wider Fediverse wasn’t the right place to start.</p>
<p>
So instead I began to explore a different way to read my home timeline. The dashboards that I’ve built and described in this series have become, for me at least, an effective way to scan recent Mastodon flow, then click into the stock client to post, reply, or boost. After overcoming a few obstacles, things are starting to feel like the <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2022/12/17/a-bloomberg-terminal-for-mastodon/">Bloomberg terminal for Mastodon</a> that I envision.</p>
<p>
One of those obstacles was the awkward copy/paste/search of foreign toot URLs that was required in order to interact with them. That’s now overcome by <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2022/12/31/instance-qualified-mastodon-urls/">Instance-qualified Mastodon URLs</a>. Another obstacle was the difficulty of curating and effectively reading topical lists of people. The strategies described in <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2022/12/22/lists-and-people-on-mastodon/">Lists and people on Mastodon</a> and <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2023/01/21/working-with-mastodon-lists/">Working with Mastodon lists</a> have improved matters nicely. And <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2023/01/16/mastodon-relationship-graphs/">relationship graphs</a> turned out to be a more useful alternate view of the current flow than I had expected.</p>
<p>
I think I’ve proven that a set of Steampipe dashboards, layered on a <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-mastodon">plugin</a> that maps the Mastodon API to tables that the dashboards query, can improve the ability to absorb and react to Mastodon flow. An unproven corollary: Steampipe’s <a href="https://steampipe.io/blog/dashboards-as-code">dashboards-as-code</a> system is only one of potentially <a href="https://steampipe.io/docs/cloud/integrations/overview">many clients</a> of the Mastodon plugin. Any dashboarding system or web app or native app could tap into the same query capability to deliver still another way to experience the flow. But that’s a future episode.</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, with a decent reading experience in place, this seemed like a good time to circle back to the question of surveying the wider Fediverse. To begin enabling that I added a couple of new tables to the plugin: <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-mastodon/blob/main/docs/tables/mastodon_peer.md">mastodon_peer</a> and <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-mastodon/blob/main/docs/tables/mastodon_domain_block.md">mastodon_domain_block</a>.</p>
<p>
Here’s a query that uses mastodon_peer.</p>
 with data as (
  select
    'https://' || server as server
  from
    mastodon_toot
  where
    timeline = 'home'
  limit 100
),
servers as (
  select
    server,
    count(*) as occurrences
  from
    data
  group by
    server
)
select
  s.server,
  s.occurrences,
  count(p.peer) as peers
from
  servers s
join
  mastodon_peer p
on
  s.server = p.server
group by
  s.server,
  s.occurrences
order by
  peers desc
 
<p>
In Engish: gather the most recent 100 toots in my home timeline, count the occurrences of each origin server, then ask each origin server how many other servers it talks to. Unsurprisingly my home server, mastodon.social, occurs most often. And because it’s the marquee Mastodon server it has the most peers. </p>

<p>
Here’s a query that uses mastodon_domain_block.</p>
 with data as (
  select
    'https://' || server as server
  from
    mastodon_toot
  where
    timeline = 'home'
  limit 100
),
servers as (
  select
    server,
    count(*) as occurrences
  from
    data
  group by

)
select

  count(d.domain) as "blocked domains"
from
  servers s
join
  mastodon_domain_block d
on
  s.server = d.server
group by
  s.server,
  s.occurrences
order by
  "blocked domains" desc
 
<p>
This one says: Again gather the origin servers in my recent home timeline, but this time ask each one how many other servers it blocks. Here we see that octodon.social, which happened to show up in my timeline when I ran the query, blocks a lot more servers than mastodon.social does.</p>
 +--------------------------+-------------+-----------------+
| server                   | occurrences | blocked domains |
+--------------------------+-------------+-----------------+
| https://octodon.social   | 1           | 510             |

<p>
One could, and maybe at some point I will, comprehensively acquire and store this data. But meanwhile, how might it enhance the experience of reading recent Mastodon flow? Here’s what I’ve got so far.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/blocked-servers.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>
We’ve already seen the first table which answers the question: “How many servers does each of the origin servers in my timeline block?” The second table answers a different question: “Which servers are most often blocked by the origin servers in my timeline?” </p>
<p>
The blocking server list column shows an interesting mix of consensus and variation, and I think that will be something to explore comprehensively across the Fediverse. But for now I like how this view contextualizes what’s in my home timeline. Like the relationship graphs, it’s highly dynamic because my immediate network neighborhood is changing all the time. Whatever the current set of servers happens to be, though, I now have some clues about how connected each of those servers is and how aggressively each one is blocking others. This feels like a good first step toward mapping the wider Fediverse.</p>

<p>2022 marked the end of a big chapter of my life. The culmination of my PhD journey, easily the most challenging project I have ever undertaken. Alongside graduating from my PhD as a Doctor of Philosophy, this year I formalised my relationship as a Consultant Requirements Engineer at Legendary Requirements, helped to produce RWOT the Hague and participated in a research sprint focused on <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/projects/digital-identity-times-crisis">Digital Identity in Times of Crisis</a> coordinated by the Berkman Klein Center where I wrote a soon to be published short hopepunk story titled Experiences in Memory Space. </p>
<p>This post is a brief reflection on and celebration of this last year and the PhD adventure that brought me to this moment. It will likely be the last post I submit to this site, as I experiment with new self-presentations of myself online. </p>
<p>First, I have to say what an honour, joy and privilege it was to participate as one of the first PhD students at the Blockpass Identity Lab at Edinburgh Napier University. I didn’t fully comprehend what I was getting myself into back in <a href="https://wip-abramson.dev/bil-launch">2018</a>, but it exceeded my expectations. </p>
<p>That I had the freedom and support to explore the boundaries and the depths of human knowledge is something I will be forever grateful for. To perceive the interconnections and evolution of human scientific thought stretching back into our past, back to the seeds of ideas and the subsequent foundations upon which our modern information society has been built. It has been both an awe-inspiring and humbling experience. I am grateful to all those who influenced, shaped and supported me along the way, especially my PhD supervisor and mentor Professor Bill Buchanan.</p>
<p>It is telling that the last post I made to this site was almost two years ago in March 2021. Since then, almost all of my writing energy was turned towards producing my thesis. In the process I wrote over 200,000 words on <a href="https://new.750words.com/">750words.com</a>, a lifesaving practice where I worked through my goals, fears, doubts and initial drafts. Then there were the countless words produced iterating through drafts, revisions and rewrites as I attempted to corral my thoughts and sythesise my learnings into a coherent, consistent body of text. The end result being an 80,000 word tome titled Identity and Identification in an Information Society: Augmenting Formal Systems of Identification with Technological Artefacts that I imagine few will ever read. Regardless, it is a piece of work I will always be proud of.</p>
<p>My thesis presents my unique perspective on the identification systems, shaped by my academic research across multiple disciplinary boundaries and my practical experience as an implementer and participant in the rapidly evolving decentralized identity space. I believe there are some nuggets within its pages. My personal highlights include:</p>
 
 The chapter titled Security without Identification which traces the history and evolution scientific thought on cryptography through the lens of cryptographic credentials first conceptualised by David Chaum’s seminal paper <a href="https://www.cs.ru.nl/~jhh/pub/secsem/chaum1985bigbrother.pdf">Security without Identification</a>. 
 My determination to include a broader, sociological understanding of identification systems, despite advice that it should be left out of scope. See Chapters Identity, Trust and Privacy in an Information Society and Identification Systems. 
 The workshop I ran at the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.14864.pdf">Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh</a> that introduced verifiable credentials and explored issues and perceptions around their use for clinical passporting solutions. 
 The subtle influences of Ludwick Fleck’s work: <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/G/bo25676016.html">The Genesis and Development of a Scientific Fact</a> that I attempted to weave throughout my thesis. 
 The diverse, high quality references throughout my thesis, that are testament to the depth and breadth of human knowledge produced on identity and identification throughout the last 100 years. 
 The content in my appendix, especially my wacky abstract diagrams and a paper I wrote but never published that talks about identity and interaction in terms of complex adaptive systems. 
 
<p>Of course there are some aspects I am less pleased with, but I imagine that is always the case. I completed it, passed my viva and graduated which is all that really matters at the end of the day.</p>
<p>I have ambitions to synthesise and adapt parts of my thesis into more digestible content which I will make available on my new professional self-presentation - <a href="https://drwip.com">https://drwip.com</a>. We will see how that goes. In the meantime, if you are interested to give it a read I am happy to send it across.</p>
<p>It is also important to point out that the thesis is not the journey, just like the map is not the territory. There were so many other explorations, side quests, learning opportunities and experiences that shaped my perspective throughout my PhD and are not well reflected in the thesis. Growing into a researcher and developing my academic voice, exploring the beauty of Edinburgh and Scotland, learning Rust, participating in the interdisciplinary <a href="https://francesryanphd.com/2019/12/tapestry-sandpit-register/">TAPESTRY research sandpit</a>, over two years collaborating with the <a href="https://www.openmined.org/">OpenMined </a>community, the <a href="https://wip-abramson.dev/mapping-workshop">Odyssey hackathon</a> where I contributed to the initial POC for the <a href="https://commonsstack.org/">Commons Stack</a>, <a href="https://wip-abramson.dev/rwot8">RWOT Barcelona</a>, <a href="https://wip-abramson.dev/mapping-workshop">MyData</a>, my <a href="https://wip-abramson.dev/codi-virtual">attempt</a> at the Cabaret of Dangerous Ideas as part of the unfortunately virtual Edinburgh Fringe, my evolving thoughts about <a href="https://wip-abramson.dev/ideas-memory">memory and meaning</a> and countless other experiences. With at least half of my studies against the backdrop of the pandemic, adding its own layer of challenges into the mix and changes to adapt to.</p>
<p>My PhD journey was daunting, exhilarating, stressful, inspiring, exhausting, humbling and joyful at different moments along the way. A rollercoaster of emotions, motivation, exhaustion and determination. I am glad it is over, but I will be forever grateful for the opportunities and experiences that it opened up for me. </p>
 Looking to the Future 
<p>The future is unknown and unknowable. However, despite this I have repeatedly seen the value of setting expectations of it. Imagining, outlining and articulating possible futures that I would like to see come to pass. In fact I am playing around with a whole new space - <a href="https://futurewip.com">https://futurewip.com</a> - to playfully explore and experiment with just this in the context of the climate emergency. Even if it is more of a placeholder at the moment. I enjoy learning a new voice and style with which to write in. Crafting new identities you might say. Which if I have learnt anything over my PhD, it is that the identities we hold, take or have applied to us shape our experienced present and inturn influence our future. I believe there a few things more powerful that intentionally constructing loosely held identities for yourself as a means to explore yourself and who you might want to be in the future. </p>
<p>Another thing I learnt during my thesis, is that I love the freedom to self-direct my attention and time whilst exploring things that I care deeply about. Which identity and identification in an information society is certainly one, as I have come to view it as critical to the future of humanity and the forms and structures it might take. Whatever I end up doing in the future, I want to make sure I have time to spend as I choose because I am confident in my ability to spend it well and know this helps me thrive. At the moment that looks like pursuing a research and development agenda focused on <a href="https://wip-abramson.dev/ideas-memory">memory and meaning</a> as previously discussed on this blog. Indeed the questions I posed on my home page two years ago appear rather prescient and increasingly relevant in the context of LLMs such as ChatGPT. The speculative fiction story I produced as part of the BKC research sprint further explores these ideas through a different creative lens. I have some other interesting ideas and experiments around this concept that I hope to share over the coming months.</p>
<p>Professionally, I see my future intertwined with Legendary Requirements. Through Legendary I have been exposed to a diverse and interesting set of clients, projects and technologies with challenging problems that are fun to work through. It is clear that we add value to our clients, that I add value to Legendary and that Legendary values my contributions. My work is flexible, engaging and self-directed. The people I work with are intelligent, kind and thoughtful. I feel fortunate to have had such a smooth transition from my PhD into a job that respects my time, supports my growth and encourages my independence.</p>
<p> The decentralized identity space is still young and emerging. Legendary Requirements is well positioned to continue to work at the forefront of this space, helping clients discover, document and maintain human requirements for real world systems and use cases. </p>
<p>I am excited to see what the future holds.</p>

<p>先週から始めた米国 NIST SP800-63-4 のInitial Public Draft (昨年12月公開、3/24までパブリックコメント受付中）をダラダラ読む会の第3回を2月2日午後10時よりおこないます。今回は、身元確認基準であるパートAの2.2節から読み始めます。この中には、氏名を尋ねるねることの妥当性などの議論も入ってくると思います。え、「氏名」を入力させたりするの当たり前だろうって？そんなこと無いんですよ。そもそも、氏と名を聞くのって、ものすごく西欧よりの文化なわけですよ。文化によっては氏はなかったり、でも氏を入力しないと処理ができなかったり、逆に入れようとすると文字数制限があって入力できなかったり、使えない字があったりですね。</p>



<p>これらは実は文化的公平性(equity)の問題でもあるのです。そして、この公平性の問題が、SP800-63の今回の改定の一つの目玉でもあるのです。</p>



<p>ちなみに、日本では明治時代に氏名に統一してしまったために比較的この辺りは分かりづらくなってはいます。ですが、依然としてこの問題は存在します。たとえば、わたしが家をお貸ししている方は外国の方で氏が無いんですね。なので、氏の欄にも名を繰り返して入れておられます。</p>



<p>また、国際線の搭乗券などでは8文字しか入れられなかったりして、わたしの搭乗券はSAKIMURA NATSUHIK になっています。某銀行のシステムも同様で、キャッシュカード兼クレジットカードのローマ字に入力できないので短くしてくれと言われました。これ幸いと NAT SAKIMURA にしましたが<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/01/5164/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-5164" title="もの名前向けに振込できないというおまけ付き">1</a>。</p>



<p>そもそもわたしの氏の漢字が入力できないところ多いです。「﨑」がね。わたしは別に「崎」でも良いのですが戸籍が「﨑」なのでこれでないとはねられてしまうことがあるのですよ。そのくせ入力できなかったり、出力が文字化けしたり。</p>



<p>そうそう、カタカナ名も問題ですね。「ナットコンサルティング」って、eLTAXに入力できないですからね。小さい「ッ」と「ィ」が入らないんですね。そのくせ漢字欄から勝手にひっぱってきて入れてたりして、何がエラーになっているかわからず、「頼む、税金払わしてくれよ〜」と泣いてました。原因究明するの大変だった。ちなみに、税理士さんからのアドバイスは「窓口で払いましょう」</p>



<p>こうした入力の制限は本来、どうして氏名を入力させるのかということに立ち返って考えるべきなんですね。たとえばeLTAXだったら、法人番号があるんだからそれで事足りるわけですよ、本来。もともと法人名称なんてユニーク性無いんだから識別子として使えないわけだし。</p>



<p>個人の側にもどると、この「氏名」を求めるというプロセスをやめると、実は改姓によって被る様々な不利益を減じたりする可能性もあるんですよね。氏名を入力させることによって、ある集団に対して申請が難しくなるなどの障害を生んでいないか、それが差別的に機能していないかなどを評価することも「公平性」の観点で重要だったりします。なので、 #選択的夫婦別姓 推進な方々もよろしければぜひ一緒に考えてみてください。</p>



<p>まぁもちろんね、SP800-63-4で問題になっている本丸は氏名ではなく、写真つき身分証明書をもとめることとかそういうことですが。</p>



<p>バージョン４はバージョン3である「SP800-63-3」に比べて、対象範囲がかなり広くなっています。この観点からはちょっと足りないところがあり、その点を著者の一人に「○○がすっぽり落ちてない？」と聞いたところ、「認識はしていてこれから書く予定だ」ということでした。「すべてのコメントは歓迎だ」とのことです。 </p>



<p>SP800-63は米国連邦政府向けの基準ですが、各国の関連規格にも大きな影響を与えています。日本の政府の基準もその中の一つです。おりしも日本政府もこのあたりの改定を考えているようですので、SP800-63をちゃんと勉強しておくことは意味があります。 </p>



<p>そこで、８回ほどに分けてSP800-63-4を読んでみようと思います。８回にわけるのは、関係する文書は</p>

  That’s a question asked on Quora and deleted before I posted my answer. So I’m posting my answer here. This is like asking if a car radio sounds better than a TV.

<p>That’s a question asked on Quora and deleted before I posted my answer. So I’m posting my answer here.</p>
<p>This is like asking if a car radio sounds better than a TV. Because it’s a matter of where, how, when, and what, more than a matter of sound.</p>
<p>There is some overlap in the sense that both SiriusXM and YouTube are fully useful on mobile apps. But you don’t watch your radio in your car or listen to your radio on your TV, even though it’s possible to do both through apps that are native to both the road (through Android Auto and Apple Carplay) and the living room (through Roku, Amazon, Apple, and other TV app platforms).</p>
<p>As for the sound itself, YouTiube lets you&nbsp;<a href="https://support.google.com/youtubemusic/answer/9076559?hl=en#zippy=%2Caudio-quality-on-wi-fi">select</a> audio quality bitrates up to 256kbps AAC &amp; OPUS. SiriusXM’s default bitrate is also 256kpbs, but over the satellite link bitrates are typically lower—sometimes much lower. But, since SiriusXM does not (to my knowledge, so far) publish their bitrates in a place that’s easy to find, its bitrates are subject to debate. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/siriusxm/comments/jhb4kt/what_are_the_different_streaming_bitrates_in_the/">Here is one of those on Reddit</a>.</p>
<p>But, again, it’s a matter of where. when, and what, more than how. If you want to see and hear a piece of music, YouTube provides enormous optionality, with its almost boundless collection of videos. If you want radio-like music programming, SiriusXM offers more—plus sports, talk, news, sports (including play-by-play for all the major ones), and more.</p>
<p>Yet the Internet has more than both put together. That’s why the image above is of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=radioparadise">Radio Paradise</a>, which is one of the oldest and best Internet music stations. It’s live on the Net and the Web, and it has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=radioparadise">Best Of</a> collections on YouTube as well.</p>
<p>Bonus link (and a lot of fun): <a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2023/01/12/fm-down/">radio.garden</a>. There’s an app for that too.</p>

<p>This post looks at implementing and using Azure AD multiple tenant applications from different tenants. A service principal needs to be created for the tenant using the multi-tenant API and consent needs to be given for the API scope. The API will accept tokens from different issuers which need to be validated. It is important that all tenants allowed to use the API are validated. </p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/AadMutliApis">https://github.com/damienbod/AadMutliApis</a></p>



<p></p>



 Setup API Azure App Registration 



<p>A multi-tenant API Azure App registration is used to expose the scope which is required to use the API. The API is implemented using ASP.NET Core and validates this claim in the JWT token as well as other claims. V2 tokens are required and only delegated access tokens are created from this App registration. </p>







<p></p>



 Implement the API 



<p>An ASP.NET Core application implements the API and the security logic validating the access token. An explicit list of issuers can use the API The API validates that a secret is required to authenticate and the client that requested the access token is also validated. The authorization handler validates that the token have a scope claim which means that it is a delegated access token (if produced by Azure AD). Great care has to be taken when using mutli-tenant app registrations because any tenant can use this but not any tenant should be allowed to use the API.</p>


  services.AddAuthentication(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
    .AddJwtBearer(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme, options =&gt;
    {
        options.MetadataAddress = aadMetadataAddress;
        //options.Authority = issuert1;
        options.Audience = aud;
        options.TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
        {
            ValidateIssuer = true,
            ValidateAudience = true,
            ValidateIssuerSigningKey = true,
            ValidAudiences = new List&lt;string&gt; { aud },
            ValidIssuers = new List&lt;string&gt; { issuert1 }
        };
    });

services.AddSingleton&lt;IAuthorizationHandler, ValidTenantsAndClientsHandler&gt;();

services.AddAuthorization(policies =&gt;
{
    policies.AddPolicy("ValidTenantsAndClients", p =&gt;
    {
        // only delegated trusted  known clients allowed to use the API
        p.Requirements.Add(new ValidTenantsAndClientsRequirement());

        // Validate id of application for which the token was created
        p.RequireClaim("azp", azpClientId);

        // client secret = 1, 2 if certificate is used
        p.RequireClaim("azpacr", "1");
    });
});

services.AddControllers(options =&gt;
{
    var policy = new AuthorizationPolicyBuilder()
        .RequireAuthenticatedUser()
        .AddAuthenticationSchemes(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
        .Build();
    options.Filters.Add(new AuthorizeFilter(policy));
});
  


<p>The handler validates that the scope claim has the expected value. Together with the rest of the validation, it is possible the validate that the access token is intended for this API.</p>


  public class ValidTenantsAndClientsHandler 
	: AuthorizationHandler&lt;ValidTenantsAndClientsRequirement&gt;
{

    protected override Task HandleRequirementAsync(
		AuthorizationHandlerContext context, 
		ValidTenantsAndClientsRequirement requirement)
    {
        if (context == null)
            throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(context));
        if (requirement == null)
            throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(requirement));

        var scopeClaim = context.User.Claims.FirstOrDefault(t =&gt; t.Type == "scope");

        if (scopeClaim != null)
        {
            var scopes = scopeClaim.Value.Split(" ", 
				StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries);
				
            if (scopes.Any(t =&gt; t == "access_as_user"))
            {
                context.Succeed(requirement);
            }
        }

        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
  


 Setup Service Principal for other tenants 



<p>Now that the application is ready and the App registration exists, a service principal can be created for this Azure App registration in the target tenant.  </p>


  Connect-AzureAD -TenantId '&lt;UI-tenantId&gt;'                                            

New-AzureADServicePrincipal -AppId 'AppId-from-multi-tenant-api'
  


 Give consent in your tenant to the Enterprise applications 



<p>The service principal can be found in the Enterprise applications blade.</p>



 
 Open the Enterprise Applications blade 



 Find your enterprise application using the Guid ObjectId from the Powershell script 



 Open the permissions blade 



 Grant Admin consent if you require to use local tenant permissions 
 



<p></p>



 Using and consent 



<p>To use the UI application and the multi-tenant API, consent must be given, usually by a tenant administrator on behalf of all users in this tenant. Different consents screens are displayed depending on the Azure tenant policies and the person using the application.</p>







<p></p>



<p>Once consent ahs been given, this can be viewed in the API permissions of the Enterprise application created for the target tenant.</p>







<p></p>



<p>The extra step of explicitly allowing the tenants that can use the API has advantages. You can continue to use delegated scopes and implement token exchange protocols for the downstream APIs where required. This is a secure way of connecting software systems using different identity providers if implemented correctly. A disadvantage with the approach is that each admin must give consent to use the API on their tenant.</p>

The representations are planned to use the three-party model of Issuer, Holder, and Verifier utilized by Verifiable Credentials.</p>
<p>See the newly approved JOSE charter at <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/charter-ietf-jose/03/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/charter-ietf-jose/03/</a>.  The working group will be chaired by <a href="https://twitter.com/kodonog">Karen O’Donoghue</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ve7jtb">John Bradley</a>, and John Mattsson, with the assigned area director being Roman Danyliw.</p>
<p>I believe this is a great outcome because the JOSE working group participants already have expertise creating simple, widely-adopted JSON-based cryptographic formats, such as JSON Web Signature (JWS), JSON Web Encryption (JWE), and JSON Web Key (JWK).  The new formats will be peers to JWS, JWE, and COSE, reusing elements that make sense, while enabling use of new cryptographic algorithms whose inputs and outputs are not representable in the existing JOSE and COSE formats.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in the work, please join the <a href="mailto:jose@ietf.org">JOSE mailing list</a> at <a href="https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/jose">https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/jose</a> if you’re not already a member.  Also, plan to participate in <a href="https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/116/">IETF 116 Yokohama</a>, where we should be able to have the first meeting of the reconstituted working group.  I hope to see you there!</p>
<p>As background, the first step in the JOSE rechartering was the <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=2286">JSON Web Proofs (JWP) BoF at IETF 114 in Philadelphia</a> sponsored by Security Area Director Roman Danyliw and chaired by <a href="https://twitter.com/kodonog">Karen O’Donoghue</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ve7jtb">John Bradley</a>, during which Jeremie Miller, <a href="https://twitter.com/kristinayasuda">Kristina Yasuda</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/tplooker">Tobias Looker</a>, and I presented.  That was follwed by a <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/interim-2022-jwp-01/session/jwp">Virtual Interim JWP BoF in October, 2022</a>, review on the ietf-announce mailing list, and multiple IESG discussions.</p>
<p>All of which brings us back to the (now recurring!) question:  “What Would JOSE Do?”  Join us and be part of answering it!</p>

  <p>Signs are <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/01/08/gurman-ar-headset-spring/">pointing</a>
that Apple will announce its first headset in the next few months. This would be
a major new product for Apple – and the industry beyond –, but there is very little
excitement in the air.</p>
<p>We can blame Meta for that. After buying Oculus, iterating over the product for
almost 9 years since, and reportedly spending more than
<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/17/why-reality-labs-will-keep-losing-billions-even-as-meta-makes-big-cuts.html">$10 billion a year</a>
on it, their VR products remains a distinct Meh. I bought a Quest 2 myself, and while it
definitely has some interesting features (I climbed Mt Everest, in VR!), it mostly
sits on the shelf, gathering dust.</p>
<p>So the industry consensus is that Apple’s won’t amount to much either. If Meta
couldn’t find compelling use cases, the thinking goes, Apple won’t either, because
there aren’t any! (Other than some limited forms of gaming and some niche enterprise ones.)</p>
<p>I think this line of thinking would be a mistake.</p>
<p>My argument: Apple understands their customers and works down their use cases better than
anybody. If Apple works on a new product category for many years – and signs are that
they have – and then finally decides that the product is ready, chances are, it is.
Their track record on new products is largely unblemished since the return of Jobs
about 25 years ago:</p>
 
 fruity fun design for a computer (iMac) – success 
 digital music player (iPod) – smashing success 
 smartphone (iPhone) – so successful it killed and reinvented an entire industry 
 table (iPad) – success 
 watch (iWatch) – success 
 … and many smaller products, like headsets, voice assistance, Keynote etc. 
 
<p>Looking for a major dud in those 25 years, I can’t really find one. (Sure, some smaller
things like the 25-year anniversary Mac – but that was always a gimmick, not a
serious product line.)</p>
<p>It appears that based on their history, betting against Apple’s headset is not a smart move.
Even if we can’t imagine why an Apple headset would be compelling before we see it: we
non-Apple people didn’t predict iPhone either, but once we saw it, it was “immediately”
obvious.</p>
<p>So let’s turn this around. What about we instead assume the headset will be a major success?
Then what?</p>
<p>I believe this would transform the entire technology industry profoundly. For
historical analogies, I would have to go back all the way to the early 80’s when
graphical user interfaces first became widely used – coincidentally (or not) an
Apple accomplishment: they represented a fundamentally different way of interacting
with computers than the text terminals that came before them. Xerox Parc
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_graphical_user_interface">gave that demo</a>
to many people. Nobody saw the potential and went with it, just Apple did. And they pulled
a product together that caused the entire industry to transform. Terminals are still in
use, but only by very few people for very specific tasks (like system administrators).</p>
<p>What if AR/VR interfaces swept the world as the GUI swept the PC?</p>
<p>I believe they can, if somebody relentlessly focuses on uses cases and really makes
them work. I built my first 3D prototype in VRML in 1997. It was compelling back then
and it would be today. Those uses can be found, I’m quite certain.</p>
<p>Based on everything we’ve seen, it’s clear that Meta won’t find them. Hanging out
with your friends who don’t look like your friends in some 3D universe is just not
it. But if anybody can do it, it’s Apple.</p>
<p>So I’m very much looking forward to seeing what they came up with, and I think you
should be, too.</p>

<p>Even if you have not such a need and you only have an interest in learning about KERI (Key Event Receipt Infrastructure) this post is also for you.</p>



 

 KERI KLI Series: Sign and Verify



 Sign and Verify 



<p>“Sign and Verify with Heartnet” is the first of the KERI Tutorial Series focused on accomplishing tasks the KERI command line. This tutorial uses <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy">KERIpy</a>, the Python reference implementation of the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keri">KERI protocol</a>.</p>



 Our Task 


 
 


<p>The task for today is simple: </p>



 
 Establish trust between Allie and Brett’s communication lines 



 Sign a love letter from Allie to Brett 



 Verify the love letter signature 



 Sign a love reply from Brett to Allie 



 Verify the love reply signature 
 



<p>The diagram below shows what you will end up with, a local KERI network with two keystores, one each for Allie and Brett, and a pool of six witnesses, the demonstration witness pool provided by the Python implementation of KERI. </p>


 
 


 Outline 



 
 Set up your machine for a KERI deployment.
 
 Docker Setup with GLEIF image – Easiest 



 Manual Setup form Source – Harder 
 
 



 Create configuration and keystore directories 



 Start Witness network 



 Initialize keystores 



 Create KERI identifiers by making an inception event 



 Connect the two KERI identifiers using OOBIs (direct service discovery) 



 Increase the trust level with MFA challenge phrases 



 Write and sign the love letter 



 Verify the love letter signature 



 Write and sign the love reply 



 Verify the love reply 
 



 General notes 



 
 The “$” dollar sign character indicates the type of shell being used, specifically a user shell rather than a root shell (signified by a pound sign “#”). You do not need to type the “$” character when it appears at the beginning of a shell command line. 



 I make frequent use of the shell continuation character “\” to provide readability to commands. This could be hard on the eyes of seasoned professionals though it is helpful for those new to KERI and those who appreciate separate arguments on separate lines. <br>You do not need to use this continuation character when you use the commands. You can omit it and type everything on or condense everything to one line. 



 Output of commands is typically included in code highlighting blocks directly after the command with a header of “Output:”. 
 



 Step 1: Machine Setup 



 Docker Setup with GLEIF image – Easiest –  



 Docker Setup on OSX and Unix 



 
 Install Docker 



 Run the following command: <code>docker run --rm -it gleif/keri /bin/bash</code> 
 



<p>Make sure to include the “/bin/bash” command as the default command in the GLEIF image is to run Python as it is based on the python:3.10.4-alpine3.16 image. You want a shell prompt, not a Python prompt.</p>



 Docker Setup on Windows 



<p>Thank you to Jim Martin for the Windows instructions here.</p>



 
 Install Docker<br>Detailed instructions at Docker docs:<br><a href="https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/">https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/</a>








 
 Install WSL2<br>Detailed instructions for installing WSL2:<br><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install</a> 
 



 
 The following will install the defaults (Ubuntu):
 
 Open Powershell 



 Enter the command: <br><code>wsl –install</code> 



 Restart your computer 
 
 
 



 
 Download Docker Desktop installer for Windows<br><a href="https://desktop.docker.com/win/main/amd64/Docker%20Desktop%20Installer.exe">https://desktop.docker.com/win/main/amd64/Docker%20Desktop%20Installer.exe</a> 



 Double-click the Docker installer to begin the install, or alternatively you can install via the the Powershell command line:<br><code>Start-Process 'Docker Desktop Installer.exe' -Wait install</code> 



 Docker will not automatically start after installing. Use the Windows Start menu to find and start Docker Desktop. 
 
 



 Run the following command at the Powershell command line
 
 <code>docker run --rm -it gleif/keri /bin/bash</code> 
 
 
 



 Manual Setup from Source – Harder 



 Linux (recommended, especially as a Ubuntu container) 



 
 Install Git, cURL, Python 3, Python 3 PIP, Python 3 Venv, Libsodium-dev, maturin, and the Rust toolchain
 
 <code><code>$ </code>apt update</code> 



 <code>$ apt install git curl python3 python3-pip python3-venv libsodium-dev</code> 



 <code>$ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | bash -s -- -y</code> 



 <code>$ source "$HOME/.cargo/env"</code> 



 <code>$ pip3 install maturin</code> 
 
 



 Make the working directory /keri
 
 <code>$ mkdir /keri</code> 



 <code>$ cd /keri</code> 
 
 



 Install KERI
 
 <code>$ git clone https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy.git</code> 



 <code>$ python3 -m pip install -e ./</code> 
 
 



 Verify your installation
 
 <code>$ kli version</code> 



 This should output something like “0.6.8” or “0.6.9” 
 
 
 



 Manual Setup on OS X / Mac 



<p>If you are going to install with OS X then be sure to translate all of the “/keri” directories to whatever the root directory is you are using for this tutorial work.<br>I will use $HOME/allie-brett.<br>You will also need to translate the “python” commands to whatever you end up having on your system whether “python3”, “python3.10”, or anything like that. I use “python” because I set up my system to point to my Pyenv installation in <code>$HOME/.pyenv/shims/python</code> binary.</p>



 
 With <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>: Install Python 3, Python 3 PIP, Python 3 Venv, Libsodium-dev, maturin, and the Rust toolchain
 
 Installing Python 3 on a Mac is a rather involved process since the operating system default installation can interfere with things. <br>Use the following freeCodeCamp guide to install “pyenv” and then install Python 3 on top of that: <br><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-version-on-mac-update/">How to Install Python 3 on Mac – Brew Install Update Tutorial</a> 



 <code>$ brew install libsodium</code> 



 <code>$ pip install maturin</code> 
 
 



 Set up the working directory
 
 <code>$ mkdir $HOME/allie-brett</code> 



 <code>$ cd $HOME/allie-brett</code> 
 
 



 Install KERI
 
 <code>$ git clone git clone https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy.git</code> 



 <code>$ cd $HOME/allie-brett/keripy</code> 



 <code>$ python -m pip install -e ./</code> 
 
 



 Verify your installation
 
 <code>$ kli version</code> 



 This should output something like “0.6.8” or “0.6.9” 
 
 
 



 Manual Setup on Windows 



<p>Thanks to Jim Martin for providing these installation instructions.</p>



<p>Install the 64-bit versions of the following:</p>



 
 Winget (may already be installed on your system, run winget -version at the Powershell command line to check.): <br><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/releases">https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/releases</a> 



 Git<br>Use winget at the Powershell command line:<br><code>winget install --id Git.Git -e --source winget</code><br>Or download the most recent git installer from <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/win">https://git-scm.com/download/win</a> 



 Python3:<br>Use winget at the Powershell command line to find the most recent version of Python:<br><code>winget search Python.Python</code><br>As of this writing, Python 3.12 is the most recent. Use the given Id to install python with winget:<br><code>winget install -e --id Python.Python.3.12</code> 



 Python PIP:<br>Use the Powershell command to install:<br><code>python get-pip.py</code> 



 Venv:<br>Use the Powershell command to install:<br><code>pip install virtualenv</code> 



 Libsodium:<br>First, install download and build the Microsoft vcpkg tool at the Powershell command line:<br><code>mkdir vcpkg</code><br><code>cd vcpkg</code><br><code>git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git .</code><br><code>./bootstrap-vcpkg.bat</code><br><br>Next use the vcpkg tool to install libsodium on your computer. At the Powershell command line:<br><code>./vcpkg integrate install</code><br><code>./vcpkg install libsodium</code><br><br>Alternatively, you can follow the directions for ‘pre-built libraries at:<br><a href="https://doc.libsodium.org/installation/">https://doc.libsodium.org/installation/</a><br><br>*** There is a possibility the above may silently fail to place libsodium.dll in the Windows\System32 directory. You may need to manually copy the DLL from the pre-built library download into your Windows\System32 directory.<br>As of this writing, the most recent version of the DLL is located in the pre-built library zip file at:<br>\libsodium-1.0.18-msvc\libsodium\x64\Release\v142\dynamic\libsodium.dll 



 Rust toolchain:<br>Follow the installation instructions for 64-bit Rust at :<br><a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install">https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install</a><br><br>Be sure to restart your Powershell terminal after installation has completed. After starting a new Powershell terminal, verify your Rust install by checking the installed version:<br><code>rustc --version</code><br><br>If this does not work, the most likely issue is the PATH variable not being set properly. Consult the Rust installation page for more information.<br>Additional information about installing Rust on Windows and configuring Visual Studio code can be found at:<br><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/rust/setup">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/rust/setup</a> 



 Maturin:<br>At the Powershell command line, execute the following command:<br><code>pip install maturin</code> 



 Set up the working directory (don’t know if these work)
 
 <code>$ mkdir keri</code> 



 <code>$ cd keri</code> 
 
 



 Install KERI
 
 <code>$ git clone git clone https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy.git</code> 



 <code>$ cd %userprofile%\allie-brett\keripy</code> 



 <code>$ python -m pip install -e ./</code> 
 
 



 Verify your installation
 
 <code>$ kli version</code> 



 This should output something like “0.6.8”, “0.6.9”, or “1.0.0”.<br>This fails on Windows with the error:AttributeError: module ‘socket’ has no attribute ‘AF_UNIX’<br><br>This is due to AF_UNIX port types not being supported by Windows. Interestingly, the code is actually trying to open a logging file, which should be done a different way. It could be said that the flaw exists in the code.<br><br>In order to fix this, the following code modifications were necessary the ioflo/hio library, specifically in the <a href="https://github.com/ioflo/hio/blob/8e655fb6322eb8dad14953bf0a3c4fbd437940bd/src/hio/help/ogling.py#L169">ogling.py</a> file. ioflo/hio is the async runtime KERI is built on top of. 
 
 
 



 Hack to make KERI work on windows (test with kli version) 



 <code>At approx. line 183, you will see the lines of code:

facility = logging.handlers.SysLogHandler.LOG_USER # LOG_DAEMON
self.baseSysLogHandler = logging.handlers.SysLogHandler(address=address, 
                                                        facility=facility)

Replace this code with the following hack:

===================START CODE HACK==========================
if sys.platform == 'win32':
  # cur_filename is obtained from the os.path so it matches the source code file.
  # a better fix would be using the app name or something else relevant to the logger.
  cur_filename = os.path.splitext(os.path.basename(__file__))[0]
  log_filename = 'logs' + os.sep + 'Log_' + cur_filename + '.txt'

  # make sure the log directory exists
  if not os.path.exists("logs"):
    os.makedirs('logs')

  # use a logging handler more appropriate to windows
  self.baseSysLogHandler = logging.handlers.WatchedFileHandler(
    os.environ.get("LOGFILE", log_filename))
else:
  # if not on Windows, use the old way
  facility = logging.handlers.SysLogHandler.LOG_USER # LOG_DAEMON
  self.baseSysLogHandler = logging.handlers.SysLogHandler(address=address, 
                                                          facility=facility)
===================END CODE HACK==========================

After this fix, you should be able to run the kli version command and be rewarded with results like the following:

\&gt; kli version
0.6.9

In addition, you should also see a new logs directory inside the keri directory which contains an empty file:

Log_ogling.txt</code> 



<p>The rest of the tutorial will be using Linux since it is the easiest to work with. If you aren’t yet familiar with Docker I highly recommend you take the plunge and learn how to use it. You will be well rewarded for your efforts.</p>



 Step 2: Create configuration and keystore directories 



<p>Pretty simple, just making a few directories and configuration files. If you haven’t seen the “{,}” syntax before in making directories it allows you to specify a list of directories to be made at a given level.<br>Keep in mind the KERI_CONFIG_DIR variable as it will be used later.</p>



<p>The two witness configuration files, “allie-witness-oobis.json” and “brett-witness-oobis.json”, are the witness pool configurations for both Allie and Brett. Similarly the “magic-pencil.json” and the “secret-speaker.json” configuration files are the identifier configurations used for Allie and Brett, respectively.</p>



 <code>$ mkdir -p /keri/heartnet/keri/cf
$ mkdir /keri/{allie,brett}
$ export KERI_CONFIG_DIR=/keri/heartnet

$ echo '{"dt": "2022-01-20T12:57:59.823350+00:00","iurls": ["http://127.0.0.1:5642/oobi/BBilc4-L3tFUnfM_wJr4S4OJanAv_VmF_dJNN6vkf2Ha/controller","http://127.0.0.1:5643/oobi/BLskRTInXnMxWaGqcpSyMgo0nYbalW99cGZESrz3zapM/controller","http://127.0.0.1:5644/oobi/BIKKuvBwpmDVA4Ds-EpL5bt9OqPzWPja2LigFYZN2YfX/controller"]}' \
     &gt; /keri/heartnet/keri/cf/allie-witness-oobis.json

$ echo '{"dt": "2022-01-20T12:57:59.823350+00:00","iurls": ["http://127.0.0.1:5645/oobi/BM35JN8XeJSEfpxopjn5jr7tAHCE5749f0OobhMLCorE/controller","http://127.0.0.1:5646/oobi/BIj15u5V11bkbtAxMA7gcNJZcax-7TgaBMLsQnMHpYHP/controller","http://127.0.0.1:5647/oobi/BF2rZTW79z4IXocYRQnjjsOuvFUQv-ptCf8Yltd7PfsM/controller"]}' \
     &gt; /keri/heartnet/keri/cf/brett-witness-oobis.json

$ echo '{"transferable": true,"wits": ["BBilc4-L3tFUnfM_wJr4S4OJanAv_VmF_dJNN6vkf2Ha","BLskRTInXnMxWaGqcpSyMgo0nYbalW99cGZESrz3zapM","BIKKuvBwpmDVA4Ds-EpL5bt9OqPzWPja2LigFYZN2YfX"],"toad": 3,"icount": 1,"ncount": 1,"isith": "1","nsith": "1"}' \
     &gt; /keri/allie/magic-pencil.json

$ echo '{"transferable": true,"wits": ["BM35JN8XeJSEfpxopjn5jr7tAHCE5749f0OobhMLCorE","BIj15u5V11bkbtAxMA7gcNJZcax-7TgaBMLsQnMHpYHP","BF2rZTW79z4IXocYRQnjjsOuvFUQv-ptCf8Yltd7PfsM"],"toad": 3,"icount": 1,"ncount": 1,"isith": "1","nsith": "1"}' \
     &gt; /keri/brett/secret-speaker.json</code> 



<p>At this point you have created the keystores and have the foundation set up for both Allie and Brett</p>


 
 


 Step 3: Start Witness Network 



<p>Very simple, one command, since the demo witness network is being used. Ensure you follow the command with the ampersand “&amp;” sign so it runs in the background and you can use your terminal session for the rest of the commands. Alternatively you can run this in a separate terminal window or with something like the <a href="https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-linux-screen/">screen</a> command.</p>



 <code>$ kli witness demo &amp;

Output will look like:

</code> 



<p>The witness network is a set of six witnesses separated into two groups, three each for Allie and Brett.</p>


 
 


 Step 4: Initialize Keystores 



<p>You create a unique cryptographic salt for Allie that is used to derive her public key. This salt should be kept secure with the utmost protections. You can use other sources for the salt.</p>



<p>For Allie:</p>



 <code>$ export ALLIE_SALT="$(kli salt)"
$ kli init \
      --name allie_ks \
      --base /keri/allie  \
      --nopasscode \
      --salt ${ALLIE_SALT} \
      --config-dir ${KERI_CONFIG_DIR} \
      --config-file allie-witness-oobis

Output:
KERI Keystore created at: /keri/allie/allie_ks

<p>For Brett:</p>



 <code>$ export BRETT_SALT="$(kli salt)"
$ kli init \
      --name brett_ks \
      --base /keri/brett  \
      --nopasscode \
      --salt ${BRETT_SALT} \
      --config-dir ${KERI_CONFIG_DIR} \
      --config-file brett-witness-oobis

<p>You have now successfully initialized the keystores for Allie and Brett.</p>


 
 


 Step 5: Create KERI identifiers by making an inception event 



<p>The most important part to being able to use KERI is the creation of KERI identifiers, also known as <a href="https://github.com/trustoverip/acdc/wiki/autonomic-identifier">Autonomic Identifiers</a>, or AIDs. One identifier will be created for each Allie and Brett. The witnesses in the witness pools will each observe, or witness, the inception event and give a receipt of that observation back to the AID controller.</p>



 
 Allie’s AID will be aliased as “magic-pencil”
 
 She writes her love letter with a magic pencil! 
 
 



 Brett’s AID will be aliased as “secret-speaker”
 
 Brett has a special device known as a secret speaker that will only play verified messages from his sweetheart. 
 
 
 



<p>For Allie:</p>



 <code>$ kli incept \
      --name allie_ks \
      --base /keri/allie \
      --alias magic-pencil \
      -f /keri/allie/magic-pencil.json

Output:
Waiting for witness receipts...
Prefix  EGdeGrvLiZ7K8KFuSrFhc4AghPwkwi-qEMGKokaTh2JP
	Public key 1:  DDENeQF4NUaO4AdJfNdyxnrEYRTCIZoEzJ9kh4t0woLN

Place the prefix in a variable for later
$ export ALLIE_PREFIX=EGdeGrvLiZ7K8KFuSrFhc4AghPwkwi-qEMGKokaTh2JP</code> 



<p>For Brett:</p>



 <code>$ kli incept \
      --name brett_ks \
      --base /keri/brett  \
      --alias secret-speaker \
      -f /keri/brett/secret-speaker.json

Output:
Waiting for witness receipts...
Prefix  EMFWPbZf4uG2XUV-LSJ4zWkLU-2tbuCMZh36gW1NeJiA
	Public key 1:  DE2RDQFCUvEx8kcKEg15S8txBZ8X1lURdwLpWylLD2Jm

Do the same thing for Brett's prefix:
$ export BRETT_PREFIX=EMFWPbZf4uG2XUV-LSJ4zWkLU-2tbuCMZh36gW1NeJiA</code> 



<p>Now that both of the identifiers are set up then <a href="https://github.com/trustoverip/acdc/wiki/key-event-log">key event logs</a> (KELs) have been created for Allie and Brett. You also see that receipts from each of the witnesses sent back to the <a href="https://github.com/trustoverip/acdc/wiki/controller">controller</a> of each AID are stored in the key event log and can be called a <a href="https://github.com/trustoverip/acdc/wiki/key-event-receipt-log">key event receipt log</a> (KERL).</p>


 
 


 Step 6: Connect the two KERI identifiers using OOBIs (direct service discovery) 



<p>Currently Allie and Brett’s KERI controller nodes (their AID controllers) do not know about each other and must be introduced to begin the trust bond.</p>



<p>To do this you first generate an <a href="https://github.com/trustoverip/acdc/wiki/out-of-band-introduction">Out Of Band Introduction</a> (OOBI) value for a given source identifier and then you pass that value to the destination who you want to learn about the location of, or discover, the source.</p>



 OOBI Generation 



<p>For Allie:</p>



 <code>$ kli oobi generate \
      --name allie_ks \
      --base /keri/allie \
      --alias magic-pencil \
      --role witness

Output:
http://127.0.0.1:5642/oobi/EGdeGrvLiZ7K8KFuSrFhc4AghPwkwi-qEMGKokaTh2JP/witness
http://127.0.0.1:5643/oobi/EGdeGrvLiZ7K8KFuSrFhc4AghPwkwi-qEMGKokaTh2JP/witness
http://127.0.0.1:5644/oobi/EGdeGrvLiZ7K8KFuSrFhc4AghPwkwi-qEMGKokaTh2JP/witness</code> 



<p>You see an OOBI value for each of the witnesses specified in the configuration file. Take any one of these values to place in the magic_pencil_oobi variable:</p>



 <code>$ export magic_pencil_oobi=http://127.0.0.1:5642/oobi/EGdeGrvLiZ7K8KFuSrFhc4AghPwkwi-qEMGKokaTh2JP/witness</code> 



<p>For Brett:</p>



 <code>$ kli oobi generate \
      --name brett_ks \
      --base /keri/brett \
      --alias secret-speaker \
      --role witness

Output:
http://127.0.0.1:5645/oobi/EMFWPbZf4uG2XUV-LSJ4zWkLU-2tbuCMZh36gW1NeJiA/witness
http://127.0.0.1:5646/oobi/EMFWPbZf4uG2XUV-LSJ4zWkLU-2tbuCMZh36gW1NeJiA/witness
http://127.0.0.1:5647/oobi/EMFWPbZf4uG2XUV-LSJ4zWkLU-2tbuCMZh36gW1NeJiA/witness</code> 



<p>And again put one of the values in the secret_speaker_oobi variable:</p>



 <code>$ export secret_speaker_oobi=http://127.0.0.1:5645/oobi/EMFWPbZf4uG2XUV-LSJ4zWkLU-2tbuCMZh36gW1NeJiA/witness</code> 



 OOBI Resolution (discovery) 



<p>We switch up the storyline order here and have Allie introduce her magic-pencil AID to Brett followed by Brett introducing his secret-speaker AID to Allie. This mutual resolution of OOBIs to completes the discovery process.</p>



<p>For Brett:</p>



 <code>kli oobi resolve \
    --name brett_ks \
    --base /keri/brett \
    --oobi-alias magic-pencil \
    --oobi "${magic_pencil_oobi}"

Output: 
http://127.0.0.1:5642/oobi/EGdeGrvLiZ7K8KFuSrFhc4AghPwkwi-qEMGKokaTh2JP/witness resolved</code> 



<p>This introduces Allie to Brett. Allie has shared her magic-pencil OOBI with Brett and Brett has resolved that OOBI (a URL) using typical internet infrastructure to find and connect with Allie’s AID. Brett’s secret-speaker AID then analyzes the key event log of Allie’s magic-pencil AID and verifies it so Brett’s secret-speaker AID knows it can trust it is really speaking with Allie’s magic-pencil AID.</p>


 
 


<p>For Allie:</p>



 <code>$ kli oobi resolve \
      --name allie_ks \
      --base /keri/allie \
      --oobi-alias secret-speaker \
      --oobi "${secret_speaker_oobi}"

Output:
http://127.0.0.1:5645/oobi/EMFWPbZf4uG2XUV-LSJ4zWkLU-2tbuCMZh36gW1NeJiA/witness resolved</code> 



<p>This introduces Brett to Allie. Brett gives his secret_speaker_oobi value to Allie which she uses to then resolve his location using typical internet infrastructure, establishes a connection with him, and then verifies his key event log for the secret-speaker AID to ensure she can trust the secret-speaker. </p>


 
 


 Step 7: Increase the trust level with MFA challenge phrases 



<p>As a multi-factor authentication (MFA) method you can issue challenge phrases to an identifier that it would prepare a response to which you could then verify using the challenge verify workflow. For Allie and Brett they both generate their own challenge phrase which the other party signs after which the original party who generated the challenge phrase verifies the signature of the signed phrase.</p>



 Generate Challenge Phrase 



<p>The <code>kli challenge generate</code> command works like so:</p>



 <code>$ kli challenge generate --out string

Sample Output:
ranch space pipe later they jazz retreat tide expand inform barrel gorilla</code> 



<p>For brevity I use command expansion and string interpolation to generate the challenge phrases. You can use any string you like for the challenge phrase and are not limited to phrases generated by <code>kli challenge generate</code>.</p>



<p>For Allie:</p>



 <code>allie_words="$(kli challenge generate --out string)"</code> 



<p>For Brett:</p>



 <code>brett_words="$(kli challenge generate --out string)"</code> 



 Prepare Challenge Response 



<p>Allie prepares a response to Brett’s challenge phrase and Brett verifies Allie’s challenge response.</p>



 <code>Allie preparing a response to Brett's challenge phrase:
$ kli challenge respond \
      --name allie_ks \
      --base /keri/allie \
      --alias magic-pencil \
      --recipient secret-speaker \
      --words "${allie_words}"

Output: no output

Brett verifying Allie's challenge response:
$ kli challenge verify \
      --name brett_ks \
      --base /keri/brett \
      --alias secret-speaker \
      --signer magic-pencil \
      --words "${allie_words}"

Output:
Checking mailboxes for any challenge responses..

Signer magic-pencil successfully responded to challenge words: '['term', 'spatial', 'weasel', 'prison', 'sniff', 'worth', 'unfold', 'balance', 'motor', 'monkey', 'cloud', 'economy']'</code> 


 
 


<p>Brett then similarly prepares a response to Allie’s challenge phrase and Allie verifies Brett’s challenge response.</p>



 <code>Brett preparing a response to Allie's challenge phrase:
$ kli challenge respond \
      --name brett_ks \
      --base /keri/brett \
      --alias secret-speaker \
      --recipient magic-pencil \
      --words "${brett_words}"

Output: no output

Allie verifying Brett's challenge response:
$ kli challenge verify \
      --name allie_ks \
      --base /keri/allie \
      --alias magic-pencil \
      --signer secret-speaker \
      --words "${brett_words}"

Output:
Checking mailboxes for any challenge responses..

Signer secret-speaker successfully responded to challenge words: '['life', 'lift', 'sheriff', 'same', 'gentle', 'traffic', 'foot', 'trash', 'approve', 'dawn', 'audit', 'type']'</code> 


 
 


 Step 8: Write and sign the love letter 



<p>Now we can finally do what we came here to do! It’s time to write the letter and sign it.</p>



<p>Allie’s love letter:</p>



 <code>Allie writes the letter:
$ echo '{"love_letter": "well, hello there, honey. Happy Valentines :*"}' &gt; /keri/heartnet/love-letter.json

And signs it:
$ kli sign \
      --name allie_ks \
      --base /keri/allie \
      --alias magic-pencil \
      --text @/keri/heartnet/love-letter.json 

Output (is a signature):
1. AAAZP-KPS1FtkeVNvvm8uSFJqlDNmJy8tpD1hB2-OYcmlP39Fog4wETcDEL_4QNXHeUVV_QiuUpqbxgIzAaiV9EK

Place output in a variable:
export ALLIE_SIGNATURE=AAAZP-KPS1FtkeVNvvm8uSFJqlDNmJy8tpD1hB2-OYcmlP39Fog4wETcDEL_4QNXHeUVV_QiuUpqbxgIzAaiV9EK</code> 



 Step 9: Verify the love letter signature 



<p>Brett wants to know this letter really is from Allie so he verifies it with kli verify:</p>



 <code>Brett verifies Allie's signature on the love letter:
$ kli verify \
      --name brett_ks \
      --base /keri/brett \
      --alias secret-speaker \
      --prefix $ALLIE_PREFIX \
      --text @/keri/heartnet/love-letter.json \
      --signature $ALLIE_SIGNATURE

Output:
Signature 1 is valid.</code> 


 
 


 Step 10: Write and sign the love reply 



<p>In turn, for such a show of affection from Allie, Brett signs and returns a love reply.</p>



 <code>Brett's love reply:
$ echo '{"love_letter": "Hey sweetie, I got your letter! &lt;3 &lt;3"}' &gt; /keri/heartnet/love-reply.json

And his signature:
$ kli sign \
      --name brett_ks \
      --base /keri/brett \
      --alias secret-speaker \
      --text @/keri/heartnet/love-reply.json

Output (a signature):
1. AAB3VtKayW1e1zn-RvyWLo3SChc01RitBgeYlX_apLZ8geCd8iMLFUu8exS0txwp9znjtMoayFy9-edim5Vfd7EK

And place it in a variable for later use:
export BRETT_SIGNATURE=AAB3VtKayW1e1zn-RvyWLo3SChc01RitBgeYlX_apLZ8geCd8iMLFUu8exS0txwp9znjtMoayFy9-edim5Vfd7EK</code> 



 Step 11: Verify the love reply 



<p>Allie wants to be sure this reply to her letter really came from Brett so she will verify the signature Brett sent her.</p>



 <code>Allie verifies Brett's love reply by checking his signature of it:
$ kli verify \
    --name allie_ks \
    --base /keri/allie \
    --alias magic-pencil \
    --prefix $BRETT_PREFIX \
    --text @/keri/heartnet/love-reply.json \
    --signature $BRETT_SIGNATURE

Output:
Signature 1 is valid.</code> 


 
 


<p>It verifies! Both Allie and Brett can enjoy their secure, authentic love letter communications.</p>



 Wrap up 



<p>Brett and Allie had a great laugh knowing they have a secret conversation that nobody else knows about where they can trust that they were really communicating with each other. They can now have a happy, peaceful valentines.</p>

<p>
The Mastodon dashboards I’ve been developing and describing in this series are backed by a <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-mastodon">Steampipe plugin</a> that translates SQL queries to Mastodon API calls. Like all Steampipe plugins you can use this one to run those queries in all sorts of ways: from psql or another Postgres CLI (perhaps via cron, perhaps in a CI/CD pipeline); from Metabase or Grafana or any Postgres-compatible BI tool; from Python or JavaScript or any programming language. The Steampipe core is a versatile <a href="https://steampipe.io/blog/steampipe-as-component">software component</a> that you can plug into just about any environment.</p>
<p>
There’s also, of course, Steampipe’s <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3668032/visualizing-the-hacker-news-api-with-hcl-and-sql.html">dashboards as code</a> approach which powers the alternate Mastodon UX that I’ve been exploring in this series. You can think of this dashboarding tool as a primitive web browser with a freakish talent for querying Postgres and weaving SQL results into widgets such as infocards, input controls, charts, tables, and relationship graphs. You compose widgets using HCL (Hashicorp Configuration Language) instead of HTML, arrange them using basic layout syntax, and view them by connecting your browser to the local Steampipe dashboard server or to <a href="https://cloud.steampipe.io">cloud.steampipe.io</a>.</p>
<p>
The alternate Mastodon UX built this way was aptly described (thanks again <a href="https://third-bit.com">Greg Wilson</a>!) as <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3684669/a-bloomberg-terminal-for-mastodon.html">A Bloomberg terminal for Mastodon</a>. As a reminder, the stock Mastodon web client looks like this.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2023/01/default-mastodon-view-100936040-large.jpg%22"></a></p>
<p>
And the pages served by the Mastodon dashboards look like this.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/images.idgesg.net/images/article/2023/01/steampipe-mastodon-view-100936039-orig.jpg?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>
I can scan the latter view far more effectively.</p>
<p>
Now, I’ve been trying out a bunch of alternate Mastodon clients lately. I love <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ivory-for-mastodon-by-tapbots/id6444602274">Ivory</a> on my phone, and <a href="https://elk.zone">Elk</a> in the browser, and I use them when I want an experience that feels social-media-ish. But I don’t use Ivory or Elk or Toot! or the stock Mastodon web clients (browser, phone) when I want an experience that feels RSS-reader-ish.</p>
<p>
For some information landscapes I want to unfold a big map, spread it out, and scan for points of interest. Social media is that kind of landscape, RSS readers were the first way I surveyed it effectively, and these Mastodon dashboards are becoming my new way.</p>
<p>
When I compare those two screenshots though, it’s not just the density of the latter that I notice, but also the absence of pictures. At first I fretted about that. Could the dashboard pages render full-strength HTML? Perhaps they will, and there are a few different ways that could happen, but meanwhile I’ve come to embrace the text-only constraint. When I’ve got my map unfolded, and I’m scanning my home timeline or my lists for things to click into, images can be a distraction. I wouldn’t have chosen to omit them, but I find that their absence enables me to focus very effectively on who is speaking, and what they are saying or boosting. </p>
<p>
There is also, of course, the graphical view afforded by <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2023/01/16/mastodon-relationship-graphs/">relationship graphs</a>. These feel very map-like in the way they reveal clusters of people interacting with one another. I’m finding them more useful than anticipated.</p>
<p>
But the text that I read in these dashboards is image-free for now. And I think it’s having a calming effect. There are plenty of times when I want images, don’t get me wrong, and that’s partly why I use a mix of conventional Mastodon clients. But there are times when I want to dial down the clutter, just like there are times when I switch my phone to monochrome. Two things can be true: The pictures we share with one another are a source of joy, and they are sensory overload. I’ll make them optional here when I can, and would like to have the option to use all social media interfaces in text mode.</p>

   All you need is a gazillionaire doing
strange things
to some internet platform, and all of a sudden
decentralized social media soars in adoption. So lots of people are
suddenly seriously looking at how to contribute, myself included. 
 Core to this is the ActivityPub standard,
and real-world implementations that mix it with additional independently
defined protocols, such as what Mastodon does.

  <p>All you need is a gazillionaire doing
<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/elon-musk-twitter-takeover.html">strange things</a>
to <a href="https://twitter.com/">some internet platform</a>, and all of a sudden
decentralized social media soars in adoption. So lots of people are
suddenly seriously looking at how to contribute, myself included.</p>
<p>Core to this is the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">ActivityPub</a> standard,
and real-world implementations that mix it with additional independently
defined protocols, such as what <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a> does.</p>
<p>None of them are particularly easy to understand. So I did a bit of drawing
just to make it clearer (for myself) what kind of data can be shipped around
in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse">Fediverse</a>. To be clear,
this is only a small part of the overall stack, but an important one.</p>
<p>Here are some diagrams. They are essentially inheritance diagrams that
show what kinds of activities there are, and actors, etc. Posted here
in case they are useful for others, too.</p>

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>And here’s how to interpret my homegrown graphical notation. (I made it up
for my dissertation eons ago, and used it ever since. It has certain advantages
over, say, UML or traditional ERA diagram styles. IMHO&nbsp;:-))</p>

<p>This article shows how basic authentication could be implemented in an ASP.NET Core application. This is not the recommended way to implement security for user flows as the password is always sent with each request but the flow is sometimes required to implement a standard or you sometimes need to support one side of an authentication flow which requires this.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/OAuthGrantExchangeOidcDownstreamApi">https://github.com/damienbod/OAuthGrantExchangeOidcDownstreamApi</a></p>



<p></p>



 Client implementation 



<p>An client implementation needs to send an authorization header with a clientId and a clientSecret separated using the “:” char and encoded using base64. The secret is hashed using SHA256 so as not to send the original secret in the request but this does not really improve the security much, it just prevents the original application secret being shared. The request is sent using HTTPS and so the headers are encrypted.</p>


  private static string CreateBasicAuthenticationHeader(
	GetDelegatedApiTokenOAuthTokenExchangeModel reqData)
{
	var builder = new StringBuilder()
		.Append(reqData.ClientId)
		.Append(':')
		.Append(OauthTokenExchangeExtentions
			.ToSha256(reqData.ClientSecret));

	var credentials = Convert.ToBase64String(
		Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(builder.ToString()));

	return credentials;
}
  


<p>The ShA256 hash is implemented using a simple method which returns a base64 string of this.</p>


  public static string ToSha256(string text)
{
	using var sha256 = SHA256.Create();
	var bytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(text);
	var hash = sha256.ComputeHash(bytes);

	return Convert.ToBase64String(hash);
}
  


<p>The credentials are sent using the Authentication header.</p>


  string credentials = CreateBasicAuthenticationHeader(reqData);

httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization =
new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Basic", credentials);
  


<p></p>



 Server implementation 



<p>The server part of the flow is implemented using the idunno.Authentication.Basic Nuget package. The credentials are validated using the same hash and checked against the expected values from the configuration.</p>


  services.AddAuthentication(BasicAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
.AddBasic(options =&gt;
{
	options.Realm = "oauthtokenexchange";
	options.Events = new BasicAuthenticationEvents
	{
		OnValidateCredentials = context =&gt;
		{
			var config = context.HttpContext.RequestServices
				.GetService&lt;IOptions&lt;OauthTokenExchangeConfiguration&gt;&gt;();
			
			if(ValidateBasicAuthentication.IsValid(context.Username, 
				context.Password, config.Value))
			{ 
				var claims = new[]
				{
					new Claim( ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier, 
						context.Username, 
						ClaimValueTypes.String, 
						context.Options.ClaimsIssuer),
					new Claim( ClaimTypes.Name, 
						context.Username, 
						ClaimValueTypes.String, 
						context.Options.ClaimsIssuer)
				};

				context.Principal = new ClaimsPrincipal(
					new ClaimsIdentity(claims, context.Scheme.Name));
				context.Success();
			}

			return Task.CompletedTask;
		}
	};
});
  


<p>The ValidateBasicAuthentication class checks the used credentials. </p>


  public static class ValidateBasicAuthentication
{
    public static bool  IsValid(
		string clientId, 
		string clientSecret, 
		OauthTokenExchangeConfiguration oauthTokenExchangeConfiguration)
    {
        if(!clientId.Equals(oauthTokenExchangeConfiguration.ClientId))
        {
            return false;
        };

        if (!clientSecret.Equals(
			OauthTokenExchangeExtentions.ToSha256(
				oauthTokenExchangeConfiguration.ClientSecret)))
        {
            return false;
        };

        return true;
    }
}
  


<p>The basic authentication can be validated in the authorize attribute using the correct scheme.</p>


  [Authorize(AuthenticationSchemes = BasicAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)]
[HttpPost("~/connect/oauthTokenExchangetoken"), Produces("application/json")]
public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; Exchange([FromForm] OauthTokenExchangePayload oauthTokenExchangePayload)
{
	// business
}
  


<p>This works well but sending the password and the name on ever request is not always the best way of implementing authentication. This should only be used if required when implementing a standard. There are better ways and more secure ways of securing APIs.</p>

<p>１年近く公表が遅れていた米国 NIST SP800-63-4 のプレ・ドラフトが12月に公開され、3/24までパブリックコメント受付中です。バージョン3である「SP800-63-3」に比べて、対象範囲がかなり広くなっています。この観点からはちょっと足りないところがあり、その点を著者の一人に「○○がすっぽり落ちてない？」と聞いたところ、「認識はしていてこれから書く予定だ」ということでした。「すべてのコメントは歓迎だ」とのことです。 </p>



<p>SP800-63は米国連邦政府向けの基準ですが、各国の関連規格にも大きな影響を与えています。日本の政府の基準もその中の一つです。おりしも日本政府もこのあたりの改定を考えているようですので、SP800-63をちゃんと勉強しておくことは意味があります。 </p>



<p>そこで、２回ほどに分けてSP800-63-4を読んでみようと思います。２回にわけるのは、関係する文書は</p>

Since the early days of the blogosphere I have cherished the ability to view the world through the eyes of people more qualified than me to understand and explain what happens in particular domains. Although Twitter lists were a great way to collect people who provide those perspectives, I made little use of them. Prompted by Martin Fowler’s <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/exploring-mastodon.html#frustrations-with-lists">frustration with lists</a> I described my first steps toward reviving the technique in <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2022/12/22/lists-and-people-on-mastodon/">Lists and people on Mastodon</a>. </p>
<p>First I encapsulated the relevant APIs in a pair of tables provided by the Steampipe plugin for Mastodon: <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-mastodon/blob/main/docs/tables/mastodon_list.md">mastodon_list</a> and <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-mastodon/blob/main/docs/tables/mastodon_list_account.md">mastodon_list_account</a>. Then I used those tables to enhance the <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-mastodon-insights/">Mastodon dashboard</a> in a couple of ways. The followers and following tabs now show me who is or isn’t on a list.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/following-with-lists.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>
And I can use the list tab to read recent posts from people on each list.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/mastodon-list-tab.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>
With these basic building blocks in place I want to be more intentional about curating these lists. To that end I thought I’d share the lists I’ve built so far, and invite suggestions. You can export your lists from the Mastodon web client using Preferences -&gt; Data export -&gt; Lists. The resulting CSV file has two columns: the name of a list and the Mastodon handle for a person.</p>

<p>It’s easy to create that list using the Steampipe plugin for Mastodon.</p>
<p>
steampipe query “select title as list, username, server, instance_qualified_account_url, note from mastodon_list l join mastodon_list_account a on l.id = a.list_id order by list, username” –output csv &gt; mastodon_lists.csv</p>
<p>
(I’m using <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2022/12/31/instance-qualified-mastodon-urls/">instance-qualified URLs</a> relative to my home server, if your home is elsewhere than mastodon.social you’ll want to adjust the links accordingly.)</p>
<p>
I’ve uploaded the output of that query to a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IREOYAGI87zIma_V7m-zmx7oPt_jkEpZOLje6jn2dzY">Google sheet</a>. The most recent addition to my climate list is <a href="https://mastodon.social/@petergleick@fediscience.org">Peter Gleick</a> who was quoted yesterday in Farhad Manhjoo’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/20/opinion/california-drought-flooding-climate-change.html">What Will ‘Weather Whiplash’ Mean for California?</a> I’d been looking for an expert perspective on California water policy, so I checked to see if Peter is on Mastodon, found that he is, and added him to my climate list. Here’s an example of the kind of perspective I’m looking for.</p>
<blockquote><p>
California reservoirs have captured enough water from the recent storms to supply all urban water use in the state for a year. Not counting the massive snowpack. Those claims that “all the water is being wasted flowing to the ocean” is nonsense. — <a href="https://mastodon.social/@petergleick@fediscience.org/109720107561013638">Mastodon link</a>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Of course it’s a complex issue, and I don’t think I’m wrong to be very interested in strategies for capturing more rainfall and using it to recharge aquifers. But this was a useful reality check. </p>
<p>
Who are the experts you follow in various domains? Can I cherrypick from your lists? And can we imagine a way of remixing and sharing these lists? I’m looking at you, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@lucasgonze@indieweb.social">Lucas Gonze</a>, with fond memories of how <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130729204004/http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail3655.html">Webjay</a> did that for MP3 playlists. Can we do that for Mastodon lists too?</p>

<p>Megan McArdle says this week, in the Washington Post, that “Twitter might be replaced, but not by Mastodon or other imitators.” I’m not linking to the article, you can easily find it, but that title is all we need for my purpose here, along with this bit of context: she has 93K followers on Twitter. </p>
<p>Nobody wants to walk away from that kind of audience. Well, almost nobody. Sam Harris’ recent Twitter exit is a rare example of someone concluding that a large follower count is a net negative. If I were in his shoes I’m not sure I’d be able to do the same. When my own audience was at its peak — at BYTE during the dawn of the Internet, then at InfoWorld in the early years of the blogosphere — I could press the Publish button on my blog and watch in realtime as the responses rolled in on waves of dopamine. It’s addictive, there’s never enough, you’re always looking for the next hit.</p>
<p>When Twitter started, that momentum carried forward for a while. I never racked up a huge follower count — it maxed out just shy of 6K — but most of those people followed me early on, thanks to the the ad-supported publications that had brought me to their attention. My Twitter following reached a plateau years ago. Did I wish for 100K followers? Sure, I’d be lying to pretend otherwise. But gradually I came to see that there was a sweet spot, somewhere between (let’s say) 200 and 15,000 followers, where it was possible to enjoy the kinds of pleasant and stimulating interaction that I’d first experienced in web forums and the blogosophere.</p>
<p>Until it wasn’t. Like a frog in slowly boiling water, I failed to notice how the Twitter experience degraded over time. Fewer and fewer of my 6K followers corresponded regularly, and my social graph there became stagnant. For me the Mastodon reboot has been a delightful replay of the early blogosphere: new acquaintances, collegial discussion, positive energy.</p>
<p>If you occupy a privileged position in the attention economy, as Megan McArdle does now, and as I once did in a more limited way, then no, you won’t see Mastodon as a viable replacement for Twitter. If I were still a quasi-famous columnist I probably wouldn’t either. But I’m no longer employed in the attention economy. I just want to hang out online with people whose words and pictures and ideas intrigue and inspire and delight me, and who might feel similarly about my words and pictures and ideas. There are thousands of such people in the world, not millions. We want to congregate in different online spaces for different reasons. Now we can and I couldn’t be happier. When people say it can’t work, consider why, and who benefits from it not working. </p>
<p>Here’s a <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2023/01/16/mastodon-relationship-graphs/">graph</a> of the Fediverse as it appears  from my perspective right now. </p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/server-to-server-boosts.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>It looks and feels healthy and it’s working just great. I don’t want us to replace Twitter, or imitate it. I want <a href="https://berjon.com/internet-transition/">The Internet Transition</a> that I hope is underway. </p>

<p>The new release of Steampipe is all about relationship graphs. Our <a href="https://steampipe.io/blog/release-0-18-0">blog post</a> shows how these graphs provide contextual awareness for devops and security pros who can now see all the resources related to an EC2 instance, or determine at a glance whether the permissions related to an IAM role are properly scoped. As always, developers can explore and remix the code that builds these graphs, and adapt the idioms for their own purposes in any data domain.</p>
<p>These relationship graphs are driven by SQL queries that define nodes and edges. Such queries can use any column of any table provided by <a href="https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins">any Steampipe plugin</a> to form nodes, and then edges between nodes. If you want to see connections among the people and objects represented by diverse APIs, you can now use SQL idioms to graph them. The only limit is your imagination.</p>
<p>Naturally I imagined graphing Mastodon relationships. So far I’ve built two graphs that visualize my home timeline. Here’s the first one.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/mastodon-boosts-from-selected-server.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>Here we’re looking at the most recent 50 boosts (the Mastodon version of retweet) in my homeline. This is the query to find them.</p>
 select
  *
from
  mastodon_toot
where
  timeline = 'home'
  and reblog_server is not null
  limit  50
 
<p>If we focus on Brian Marick we can see that:</p>
 
 Brian belongs to mastdn.social 
 Brian boosted a post by Tim Bray 
 Tim belongs to hachyderm.io 
 
<p>So this graph shows people on a selected server boosting people on other servers. In this case mastdn.social is the selected server, but we can refocus the graph on any other server that’s sending boosts.</p>
<p>The second graph zooms out to show the web of boost relationships among servers. If anyone on infosec.exchange boosts anyone on mastodon.world, there’s an edge connecting the two nodes. Although it’s not happening anywhere in this graph, the arrow can point both ways and would if anyone on mastodon.world were also boosting anyone on infosec.exchange.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/mastodon-boosts-server-to-server.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>Let’s build up the first graph step by step.</p>
 Step 1: Identify the selected server 
<p>Here’s the definition of the node that represents the selected server.</p>
 node {
  category = category.selected_server
  args = [ self.input.server.value ]
  sql = &lt;&lt;EOQ
    select
      server as id,
      server as title,
      jsonb_build_object(
        'server', server
      ) as properties
    from
      mastodon_boosts()
    where
      server = $1
  EOQ
}
 
<p>Per the <a href="https://steampipe.io/docs/reference/mod-resources/node">documentation</a>, a node’s query must at least select a column aliased as id. Here it’s the server column in a row returned by the above query. I’ve packaged that query into a SQL function, mastodon_boosts, to hide details (timeline = 'home' reblog_server is not null limit 50) and make it easier to focus on what’s special about each node. In this case the special quality is the server column that gives the node its identity matches the selected server.</p>
<p>If the <a href="https://steampipe.io/docs/reference/mod-resources/graph">graph</a> block includes only this node, and mastdn.social is the selected server, here is the rendering. Not much to see here yet!</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/relgraph-step-1.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>The node defines a bag of properties that can be any of the columns returned by the underlying query; these appear when you hover the node. The node also refers to a category that governs the node’s icon, color, and link. Here’s the category for the selected server.</p>
 category "selected_server" {
  color = "darkgreen"
  icon = "server"
  href  = "https://{{.properties.'server'}}"
}
 
 Step 2: Identify boosted servers 
<p>Now we’ll add boosted servers. This node uses the same set of records: the 50 most recent boosts in my feed. Again it finds just those whose server column matches the selected server. But the id is now the reblog_server which is the target, instead of the origin, of boosts from the selected server.</p>
 node {
  category = category.boosted_server
  args = [ self.input.server.value ]
  sql = &lt;&lt;EOQ
    select
      reblog_server as id,
      reblog_server as title
    from
      mastodon_boosts()
    where
      server = $1
    EOQ
}
 
<p>Here’s the graph with both selected_server and boosted_server nodes. We’ve used another category to differentiate the boosted nodes.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/relgraph-step-2.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>There’s only one selected server but it can send boosts to more than one boosted server. The default rendering folds them into one node but you can click to unfold and see all of them.</p>
 Step 3: Identify people who boost others 
<p>Where are the people? Let’s add them next, starting with the people who are sending boosts.</p>
 node {
  category = category.person
  args = [ self.input.server.value ]
  sql = &lt;&lt;EOQ
    select
      username as id,
      display_name as title,
	    jsonb_build_object(
        'instance_qualified_account_url', instance_qualified_account_url
      ) as properties
    from
      mastodon_boosts()
    where
     server = $1
    EOQ
  }
 
<p>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/relgraph-step-3.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>
The username column gives the node its identity. Note also the property instance_qualified_account_url. That’s the synthetic column we added to the Mastodon plugin <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2022/12/31/instance-qualified-mastodon-urls/">last time</a> to ensure that links to people and toots will work properly in the Mastodon client. Because it’s included in a property here, and because category.person refers to that property, links representing people in the graph will resolve properly.</p>
 Step 4: Identify people who are boosted 
<p>This node takes its identify from the reblog_username column, and uses the synthetic column instance_qualified_reblog_url to provide the link.</p>
 node {
  category = category.boosted_person
  args = [ self.input.server.value ]
  sql = &lt;&lt;EOQ
    select
      reblog_username as id,
      reblog_username as title,
      jsonb_build_object(
        'instance_qualified_reblog_url', instance_qualified_reblog_url
      ) as properties
    from
      mastodon_boosts()
    where
      server = $1
  EOQ
}
 
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/relgraph-step-4.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
 Step 5: Connect boosters on the selected server to that server 
<p>So far we’ve seen only nodes, whose queries minimally return the id property. An <a href="https://steampipe.io/docs/reference/mod-resources/edge">edge</a> connects nodes by way of a query that minimally returns columns aliased to from_id and to_id.</p>
 edge {
  sql = &lt;&lt;EOQ
    select
      username as from_id,
      server as to_id,
      'belongs to' as title
    from
      mastodon_boosts()
  EOQ
}
 
<p>You’ll also want to provide a title to label the edge. Here this edge occurs twice to represent “John Mashey belongs to mstdn.social” and “Brian Marick belongs to mstdn.social.”</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/relgraph-step-5.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
 Step 6: Connect people on boosted servers to their servers 
<p>This edge works the same way, but captures the relationship between boosted people and their servers.</p>
 edge {
  args = [ self.input.server.value ]
  sql = &lt;&lt;EOQ
    select
      reblog_username as from_id,
      reblog_server as to_id,
      'belongs to' as title
    from
      mastodon_boosts()
    where
      server = $1
  EOQ
}

 
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/relgraph-step-6.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
 Step 7: Connect boosters to the people they boost 
<p>Finally we add an edge to connect boosters to the people they boost.</p>
 edge {
  category = category.boost
  args = [ self.input.server.value ]
  sql = &lt;&lt;EOQ
    select
      username as from_id,
      reblog_username as to_id,
      'boosts' as title,
      jsonb_build_object(
        'reblog_username', reblog_username,
        'reblog_server', reblog_server,
        'content', reblog -&gt;&gt; 'content'
      ) as properties
    from
      mastodon_boosts()
    where
      server = $1
  EOQ
}
 
<p>And now we’ve completed the first graph shown above.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/relgraph-step-7.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
 Graphing GitHub relationships 
<p>You can use this grammar of nodes and edges to describe relationships in any domain. Here’s a graph that looks across all the Steampipe-related repos and shows recently-updated PRs from external contributors.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/relgraph-github-external-prs.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>And here’s one that uses <a href="https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins">any Steampipe plugin</a> to show recently-updated pull requests for a selected repo.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/relgraph-github-mod-pr-updates.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>These two views share a common SQL query and serve complementary purposes. The table is handy for sorting by date or author, the graph highlights one-to-many relationships.</p>
 Lifting the burden of context assembly 
<p>In <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2670157/what-timedance-got-right.html">What TimeDance got right</a> I mourned the passing of a tool for scheduling meetings that had excelled at bringing together the messages and documents related to a meeting. I called this “context assembly” — a term I’d picked up from Jack Ozzie, cofounder of Groove, another collaboration tool whose passing I mourn. Context assembly is hard work. Too often the burden falls on people who only need to use that context and would rather not spend time and effort creating it.</p>
<p>We’ve seen how SQL can <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3648648/how-sql-can-unify-access-to-apis.html">unify access to APIs</a>. Now it can also help us see relationships among the data we extract from those APIs.</p>

<p>The article looks at the different way a Microsoft Graph application client can be implemented and secured in an ASP.NET Core application or a .NET application. This type of client is intended for applications or application logic where no user is involved. </p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/MicrosoftGraphAppToAppSecurity">https://github.com/damienbod/MicrosoftGraphAppToAppSecurity</a></p>



<p>Accessing Microsoft Graph can be initialized for app-to-app (application permissions) security in three different ways. The flows can only be used in a trusted host. The different implementation types are as follows:</p>



 
 Using Managed Identities 



 Using Azure SDK and Graph SDK directly with client credentials 



 Using Microsoft.Identity.Client and MSAL to acquire an access token which can be used directly against Microsoft Graph or using GraphServiceClient with the DelegateAuthenticationProvider class 
 



 Using Managed Identities 



<p>Using managed identities for the Azure deployments is the most secure of the three ways to implement this client. This is because no secret or certificates are shared and so cannot be abused and there is no need for secret rotation. </p>



 Setup 



<p>We use a web application deployed to an Azure App Service to setup the security. A managed identity is created for this Azure resource. If the Azure App Service is deleted, so is the managed identity and the assigned Graph roles. Only this Azure resource can use the managed identity. </p>







<p></p>



<p>Once the Azure resource is created, the Graph App roles can be assigned to the managed identity.</p>



 Powershell scripting 



<p>I created the Powershell script using a blog from Microsoft. This powershell script finds the managed identity and assigns the User.Read.All application permission to the managed identity.</p>


  $TenantID = "&lt;your-tenant-id&gt;"
$DisplayNameServicePrincpal ="&lt;your-azure-app-registration-or-other-azure-resource&gt;"
$GraphAppId = "00000003-0000-0000-c000-000000000000"
$PermissionName = "User.Read.All"

Connect-AzureAD -TenantId $TenantID

$sp = (Get-AzureADServicePrincipal -Filter "displayName eq '$DisplayNameServicePrincpal'")

Write-Host $sp

$GraphServicePrincipal = Get-AzureADServicePrincipal -Filter "appId eq '$GraphAppId'"

$AppRole = $GraphServicePrincipal.AppRoles | Where-Object {$_.Value -eq $PermissionName -and $_.AllowedMemberTypes -contains "Application"}

New-AzureAdServiceAppRoleAssignment -ObjectId $sp.ObjectId -PrincipalId $sp.ObjectId -ResourceId $GraphServicePrincipal.ObjectId -Id $AppRole.Id
  


<p>This can be checked in the Azure portal using the Enterprise applications blade and filtering for managed identities.</p>







<p></p>



<p>The permissions contains the Graph User.Read.All application permission.</p>







<p></p>



 Implementing the client 



<p>The client is implemented using Azure.Identity and Graph SDK. We have two setups, one for the production and all other Azure deployments and one for development. The managed identity is used everywhere except the dev deployments and only this can be used. The local dev uses an Azure App registration with the client credentials flow. The GetGraphClientWithManagedIdentity method returns the  GraphServiceClient Graph SDK client setup for the correct deployment. The correct ChainedTokenCredential is used to secure the client. It is important that only the correct managed identity for the exact resource can be used in production. No secret or certificates is required for this solution, the managed identity and Azure takes care of this. The GraphServiceClient is for the application and handles the HttpClient creation so the service is created as a singleton.</p>


  using Azure.Identity;
using Microsoft.Graph;

namespace GraphManagedIdentity;

public class GraphApplicationClientService
{
    private readonly IConfiguration _configuration;
    private readonly IHostEnvironment _environment;
    private GraphServiceClient? _graphServiceClient;

    public GraphApplicationClientService(IConfiguration configuration, IHostEnvironment environment)
    {
        _configuration = configuration;
        _environment = environment;
    }

    /// &lt;summary&gt;
    /// gets a singleton instance of the GraphServiceClient
    /// &lt;/summary&gt;
    /// &lt;returns&gt;&lt;/returns&gt;
    public GraphServiceClient GetGraphClientWithManagedIdentityOrDevClient()
    {
        if (_graphServiceClient != null)
            return _graphServiceClient;

        string[] scopes = new[] { "https://graph.microsoft.com/.default" };

        var chainedTokenCredential = GetChainedTokenCredentials();
        _graphServiceClient = new GraphServiceClient(chainedTokenCredential, scopes);

        return _graphServiceClient;
    }

    private ChainedTokenCredential GetChainedTokenCredentials()
    {
        if (!_environment.IsDevelopment())
        {
            return new ChainedTokenCredential(new ManagedIdentityCredential());
        }
        else // dev env
        {
            var tenantId = _configuration["AzureAd:TenantId"];
            var clientId = _configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("AzureAd:ClientId");
            var clientSecret = _configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("AzureAd:ClientSecret");

            var options = new TokenCredentialOptions
            {
                AuthorityHost = AzureAuthorityHosts.AzurePublicCloud
            };

            // https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.identity.clientsecretcredential
            var devClientSecretCredential = new ClientSecretCredential(
                tenantId, clientId, clientSecret, options);

            var chainedTokenCredential = new ChainedTokenCredential(devClientSecretCredential);

            return chainedTokenCredential;
        }
    }
}
  


<p>The service is added to the IoC and can be used anywhere in the application. Once deployed, the managed identity is used, otherwise the dev setup runs.</p>


  builder.Services.AddSingleton&lt;GraphApplicationClientService&gt;();
builder.Services.AddScoped&lt;AadGraphSdkApplicationClient&gt;();
  


<p>I use it in a service then:</p>


  using Azure.Identity;
using Azure.Security.KeyVault.Secrets;
using Microsoft.Graph;
using System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates;

namespace GraphClientCrendentials;

public class AadGraphSdkApplicationClient
{
    private readonly IConfiguration _configuration;
    private readonly GraphApplicationClientService _graphService;

    public AadGraphSdkApplicationClient(IConfiguration configuration, GraphApplicationClientService graphService)
    {
        _configuration = configuration;
        _graphService = graphService;
    }

    public async Task&lt;int&gt; GetUsersAsync()
    {
        var graphServiceClient = _graphService.GetGraphClientWithClientSecretCredential();

        IGraphServiceUsersCollectionPage users = await graphServiceClient.Users
            .Request()
            .GetAsync();

        return users.Count;
    }
}
  


 Dev setup 



<p>An Azure App registration is used to implement the OAuth client credentials flow and uses the Graph SDK client in development. The Graph application is added to the single tenant Azure App registration. An enterprise application is created from this.</p>







<p></p>



<p>The ChainedTokenCredential uses the app.settings and the user secrets to configure the client. The client uses the OAuth client credentials flow to acquire an access token. I normally use secrets for development for simplicity but if more security is required, a certificate can be used and the secret/certificate can be used directly from an Azure KeyVault.</p>


    "AzureAd": {
    "TenantId": "7ff95b15-dc21-4ba6-bc92-824856578fc1",
    "ClientId": "3606b25d-f670-4bab-ab70-437460143d89"
    //"ClientSecret": "add secret to the user secrets"
    //"CertificateName": "[Or instead of client secret: Enter here the name of a certificate (from the user cert store) as registered with your application]",
    //"Certificate": {
    //  "SourceType": "KeyVault",
    //  "KeyVaultUrl": "&lt;VaultUri&gt;",
    //  "KeyVaultCertificateName": "&lt;CertificateName&gt;"
    //}
  },
  


 Using Azure SDK and Graph SDK directly 



<p>A Microsoft Graph client can be setup to to use the client credentials flow to initialize the Graph SDK GraphServiceClient. This is a good way of creating the OAuth client credentials flow if it is used outside the Azure tenant. It is recommended to use a certificate and this is normally stored in an Azure Key Vault. This uses the OAuth client credentials flow and uses the client assertions to acquire a new access token. </p>



<p></p>



<p>The flow can be setup to use a secret:</p>


  private GraphServiceClient GetGraphClientWithClientSecretCredential()
{
	string[] scopes = new[] { "https://graph.microsoft.com/.default" };
	var tenantId = _configuration["AzureAd:TenantId"];

	// Values from app registration
	var clientId = _configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("AzureAd:ClientId");
	var clientSecret = _configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("AzureAd:ClientSecret");

	var options = new TokenCredentialOptions
	{
		AuthorityHost = AzureAuthorityHosts.AzurePublicCloud
	};

	// https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.identity.clientsecretcredential
	var clientSecretCredential = new ClientSecretCredential(
		tenantId, clientId, clientSecret, options);

	return new GraphServiceClient(clientSecretCredential, scopes);
}
  


<p>Or setup to use a certificate:</p>


  private async Task&lt;GraphServiceClient&gt; GetGraphClientWithClientCertificateCredentialAsync()
{
	string[] scopes = new[] { "https://graph.microsoft.com/.default" };
	var tenantId = _configuration["AzureAd:TenantId"];

	var options = new TokenCredentialOptions
	{
		AuthorityHost = AzureAuthorityHosts.AzurePublicCloud
	};

	// Values from app registration
	var clientId = _configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("AzureAd:ClientId");

	var certififacte = await GetCertificateAsync();
	var clientCertificateCredential = new ClientCertificateCredential(
		tenantId, clientId, certififacte, options);

	// var clientCertificatePath = _configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("AzureAd:CertificateName");
	// https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.identity.clientcertificatecredential?view=azure-dotnet
	// var clientCertificateCredential = new ClientCertificateCredential(
	//    tenantId, clientId, clientCertificatePath, options);

	return new GraphServiceClient(clientCertificateCredential, scopes);
}

private async Task&lt;X509Certificate2&gt; GetCertificateAsync()
{
	var identifier = _configuration["AzureAd:ClientCertificates:0:KeyVaultCertificateName"];

	if (identifier == null)
		throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(identifier));

	var vaultBaseUrl = _configuration["AzureAd:ClientCertificates:0:KeyVaultUrl"];
	if(vaultBaseUrl == null)
		throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(vaultBaseUrl));

	var secretClient = new SecretClient(vaultUri: new Uri(vaultBaseUrl), credential: new DefaultAzureCredential());

	// Create a new secret using the secret client.
	var secretName = identifier;
	//var secretVersion = "";
	KeyVaultSecret secret = await secretClient.GetSecretAsync(secretName);

	var privateKeyBytes = Convert.FromBase64String(secret.Value);

	var certificateWithPrivateKey = new X509Certificate2(privateKeyBytes,
		string.Empty, X509KeyStorageFlags.MachineKeySet);

	return certificateWithPrivateKey;
}
  


<p>I usually use a secret for development and a certificate for production.</p>



 Using Microsoft.Identity.Client and MSAL 



<p>A third way of implementing the Graph client is to use Microsoft.Identity.Client or Microsoft.Identity.Web. This uses the ConfidentialClientApplicationBuilder to create a new IConfidentialClientApplication instance and can use a secret or a certificate to acquire the access token. </p>



<p>Microsoft.Identity.Client with a secret:</p>


   var app = ConfidentialClientApplicationBuilder.Create(config.ClientId)
    .WithClientSecret(config.ClientSecret)
    .WithAuthority(new Uri(config.Authority))
    .Build();

app.AddInMemoryTokenCache();
  


<p>or with a certificate and client assertions:</p>


   var app = ConfidentialClientApplicationBuilder.Create(config.ClientId)
    .WithCertificate(certificate)
    .WithAuthority(new Uri(config.Authority))
    .Build(); 
  
app.AddInMemoryTokenCache();
  


<p>The GraphServiceClient can be created using the DelegateAuthenticationProvider. As I understand you should avoid using the DelegateAuthenticationProvider if possible.</p>


  GraphServiceClient graphServiceClient =
    new GraphServiceClient("https://graph.microsoft.com/V1.0/", 
        new DelegateAuthenticationProvider(async (requestMessage) =&gt;
        {
            // Retrieve an access token for Microsoft Graph (gets a fresh token if needed).
            AuthenticationResult result = await app.AcquireTokenForClient(scopes)
                .ExecuteAsync();

            // Add the access token in the Authorization header of the API request.
            requestMessage.Headers.Authorization =
                new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", result.AccessToken);
        }));
}
  


 Notes 



<p>There are three different ways of creating Microsoft Graph application clients and it is sometimes hard to understand when you should use which. This is not for the delegated clients. In an ASP.NET Core application you would use Microsoft.Identity.Web for a delegated client which then uses Microsoft Graph on behalf of the user. System assigned managed identities do not require managing secrets or certificates but can only be used in the same tenant. The client credentials flow can be used from anywhere. Microsoft recommends using certificates when using the client credentials flow. </p>

  SSI wallets will embody people in the digital world and give them a place to stand as a peer to others online. But online services will still have accounts.

The person (and their wallet) will be the account." While I appreciate the sentiment, I think reality is much more nuanced than that because identity management is about relationships, not identities (whatever those are).</p><p>Supporting a relationship requires that we recognize, remember, and react to another party (person, business, or thing). In self-sovereign identity (SSI), the tools that support that are <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2022/12/wallets_and_agents.shtml">wallets and agents</a>. For people, these will be personal. For a business or other organization they'll be enterprise wallets and agents. The primary difference between these is that enterprise wallets and agents will be integrated with the other systems that the business uses to support the relationships they have at scale.</p>   <p>Thanks for reading Phil Windley's Technometria! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.</p>       <p>Remembering and reacting to another entity requires that you keep information about them for the length of the relationship. Some relationships, like the one I form with the convenience store clerk when I buy a candy bar, are ephemeral, lasting only for the length of the transaction. I don't remember much while its happening and forget it as soon as it's done. Others are long-lasting and I remember a great deal in order for the relationship to have utility.</p><p>So, let's say that we're living in the future where SSI is ubiquitous and I have a DID-based relationship with Netflix. I have a wallet full of credentials. In order for my relationship to have utility, they will have to remember a lot about me, like what I've watched, what devices I used, and so on. They will likely still need to store a form of payment since it's a subscription. I call that an account. And for the service Netflix provides, it's likely not optional.</p><p>Let's consider a different use case: ecommerce. I go to a site, select what I want to buy, supply information about shipping and payment, and submit the order. I can still create a DID-based relationship, but the information needed from me beyond what I want to buy can all come from my credentials. And it's easy enough to provide that I don't mind supplying it every time. The ecommerce site doesn't need to store any of it. They may still offer to let me create an account, but it's optional. No more required than the loyalty program my local supermarket offers. The relationship I create to make the purchase can be ephemeral if that's what I want.</p><p>What will definitely go away is the use of accounts for social login. In social login, large identity providers have accounts that are then used by relying parties to authenticate people. Note that authentication is about recognizing. SSI wallets do away with that need by providing the means for different parties to easily create relationships directly and then use verifiable credentials to know things about the other with certainty. Both parties can mutually authenticate the other. But even here, social login is usually a secondary purpose for the account. I have an account with Google. Even if I never use it for logging in anywhere but Google, I'll still have an account for the primary reasons I use Google.</p><p>Another thing that goes away is logging in to your account. You'll still be authenticated, but that will fade into the background as the processes we use for recognizing people (FIDO and SSI) become less intrusive and fade into the background. We have a feel for this now with apps on our smartphones. We rarely authenticate because the app does that and then relies on the smartphone to protect the app from use by unauthorized people. FIDO and SSI let us provide similar experiences on the web as well. Because we won't be logging into them, the idea of accounts will fade from people's consciousness even if they still exist.</p><p>I don't think accounts are going away anytime soon simply because they are a necessary part of the relationship I have with many businesses. I want them to remember me and react to me in the context of the interactions we've had in the past. SSI offers new ways of supporting relationships, especially ephemeral ones, that means companies need to store less. But for long-term relationships, your wallet can't be the account. The other party needs their own means of remembering you and they will do that using tools that look just like an account.</p>   <p>Photo Credit: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Creditor%27s_Ledger,_Holmes_McDougall_%284271445364%29.jpg">Creditor's Ledger, Holmes McDougall</a> from Edinburgh City of Print (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/deed.en">CC BY 2.0</a>)</p>   <p>Thanks for reading Phil Windley's Technometria!

<p>[Update: 11:20 AM Wednesday 18 January] Well, I woke this morning to hear all the signals from Gibraltar Peak back on the air. I don’t know if the site is on generator power, or if electric power has been restored. This pop-out from a map symbol on Southern California Edison’s <a href="https://www.sce.com/outage-center/check-outage-status">Power Outage Awareness Map</a>&nbsp;suggests the latter:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sce.com/outage-center/check-outage-status"></a></p>
<p>However, I am listening right now to<a href="http://am1290kzsb.com/"> KZSB/1290</a> AM’s FM signal on 96.9 from Gibraltar Peak, where the show hosts are detailing many road closures, noting that sections of Gibraltar road are “down the hill,” meaning not there anymore, and unlikely to be fixed soon. I think I also heard them say their FM transmitter is on generator power. Far as I know, they are the only station covering local road closures, buildings damaged, farms and orchards damaged, and related topics, in great detail. It’s old-fashioned local radio at its best. Hats off.</p>
<p>Looking at the power requirements up there, only two stations are high-power ones: KDB/93.7’s transmitter pumps 4.9kW into a stack of five antenna bays that yield an ERP (effective radiated power) of 12.5kW, and KDRW(KCRW)/88.7 uses about 5.9kW to produce 12kW ERP through a stack of four antenna bays. Those are on the poles at the right and left ends of this photo, which I shot after the Jesusita Fire in 2009:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/infrastructure/52624023819/in/album-72177720305197807/"></a></p>
<p>All the other stations’ transmitters require less wattage than a microwave oven. Three only put out ten watts. So, given typical modern transmitter efficiencies, I’m guessing the site probably has a 20kW generator, give or take, requiring about 2.5 gallons of propane per hour. So a 500-gallon propane tank (a typical size) will last about 200 hours. Of course, none of that will matter until the next outage, provided electrical service is actually restored now, or soon.</p>
<p>[Update: 3:34 PM Monday 16 January] Two news stories:</p>
 
 Edhat: <a href="https://www.edhat.com/news/gibraltar-road-damage">Gibraltar Road Damage</a>., by Edhat staff, Januraly 11, 2023 12:30 PM. It’s a collection of revealing Gibraltar Road photos that I wish I had seen earlier. Apologies for that. This is the text of the whole story: “A resident of Gibraltar Road shared the below photos from the recent storm damage. A section of the road appears to be washed out with a Tesla trapped under some debris.&nbsp;The Tesla slide is located approximately a quarter mile past the Rattlesnake Canyon trailhead and the washed road is about a mile past the radio tower before reaching the west fork trailhead.” If “mile past” means going uphill toward East Camino Cielo on the ridge, that means travel was (and is) impeded (at the very least) in both directions from the transmitter sites. The photos are dramatic. Please check them out. 
 Noozhawk:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.noozhawk.com/several-radio-stations-still-off-the-air-after-storm-knocks-out-power-to-gibraltar-transmitter-site/">Several Radio Stations Still Off the Air After Storm Knocks Out Power to Gibraltar Transmitter Site</a> by <a href="https://www.noozhawk.com/author/giana-magnoli/">Giana Magnoli</a>, by M<a href="https://www.noozhawk.com/author/giana-magnoli/">anaging Editor Giana Magnoli</a>, January 16, 2023 | 1:47 pm 
 
<p>From the Noozhawk story:</p>
 
 “… they’ve helicoptered up a new battery and 600 gallons of diesel fuel to the site’s backup generator, but they haven’t been able to get it to work.” I believe this is for lack of the expected banjo valve. (See below.) 
 “Southern California Edison, which supplies power to the transmission towers site, first reported an outage for the Gibraltar Road area at 2:34 a.m. Jan. 9, the day of the big storm.” That was Monday. At least some stations would have switched over to generator power then. 
 “Repair crews haven’t been sent to the site yet, according to the<a href="https://www.sce.com/outage-center/check-outage-status">&nbsp;SCE Outage Map</a>, but Franklin said he heard there could be new poles installed this week.” That’s John Franklin, who runs the whole Gibraltar Peak site. 
 “KCLU (102.3 FM) went off the air on Wednesday and was still off as of Monday.KCLU (102.3 FM) went off the air on Wednesday and was still off as of Monday. KJEE (92.9 FM) went down for several days but came back on the air on Thursday.” Note: it’s not on now—at least not on the radios I’m using. 
 “Santa Barbara County spokeswoman Kelsey Gerckens Buttitta said there are cell and radio station towers off Gibraltar Road that requires fuel to operate, and Gibraltar Road and East Camino Cielo Road are closed because of slides, debris and slipouts.” Fixing those roads will be very difficult and time-consuming. 
 
<p>The story also lists signals I reported off as of last night. One correction to that:&nbsp;K250BS/97.9, which relays KTMS/990, is on the air. This I presume is because it’s at the KTMS/KTYD site. All the signals from that site (which is up the road from Gibraltar Peak) are still up. I assume that’s either because they are fed electric power separately from Gibraltar Peak, or because they are running on generator power.</p>
<p>[Update: 11:40 AM Monday 16 January] In a private group discussion with broadcast engineers, I am gathering that a stretch of Gibraltar Road close to the Gibraltar Peak site has collapsed. The location is <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/7pNt3oethjD25xDW6">34°28’05.2″N 119°40’21″W,</a> not far from the road into the transmitter site. This is not the section marked closed by Santa Barbara County on its map <a href="https://www.countyofsb.org/2116/Road-Closures">here</a>. It is also not an easy fix, because it appears from one photograph I’ve seen (shared on a private group) that the land under the road slid away. It is also not the section where power lines to the site were knocked out. So we’re looking at three separate challenges here:</p>
 
 Restoring electrical service to Gibraltar Peak, and other places served by the same now-broken lines 
 Repairing Gibraltar Road in at least two places (the one marked on the county map and the one above) 
 Getting generators fueled and fixed. 
 
<p>On that last issue, I’m told that the site with most of the transmitters can be powered by a generator that awaits what is called a <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=banjo+valve">banjo valve</a>. The KDB facility requires propane, and stayed up longer than the others on the peak while its own supply held up.</p>
 
<p>Gibraltar Peak isn’t the highest landform overlooking Santa Barbara. At 2180 feet, it’s about halfway up the south flank of the Santa Ynez Mountains. But it does provide an excellent vantage for FM stations that want the least obstructed view of the market’s population. That’s why more local signals come from here than from any other site in the region.</p>
<p>Except for now: a time that began with the storm last Tuesday. That’s when power lines feeding the peak were broken by falling rocks that also closed Gibraltar road. Here is a list of signals that have been knocked off the air (and are still off, as of the latest edit, on Sunday, January 15 at 11:15PM):</p>
 
 88.7 KDRW, which has a studio in Santa Barbara, but mostly relays <a href="https://www.kcrw.com/">KCRW</a> from Santa Monica 
 89.5 KSBX, which relays <a href="https://www.kcbx.org/">KCBX</a> from San Luis Obispo* 
 89.9 K210AD, which relays <a href="https://www.kpcc.org/">KPCC</a> from Pasadena by way of KJAI from Ojai 
 90.3 KMRO-FM2, a booster for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KMRO">KMRO</a> in Camarillo 
 91.5 K218CP, which relays <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSN_International">KAWZ</a> from Twin Falls, Idaho 
 93.7 KDB, which relays KUSC from Los Angeles (down after running on generator power for 5 days) 
 96.9&nbsp;K245DD, which relays <a href="http://am1290kzsb.com/">KZSB</a>/1290 AM in Santa Barbara 
 97.9 K250BS, which relays <a href="http://www.ktms.com/">KTMS</a>/990 AM in Santa Barbara (and is on a KTMS tower, farther up the slope) 
 98.7 K254AH, which relays <a href="https://www.kpfk.org/">KPFK</a> from Los Angeles 
 102.3 KK272DT, the FM side of <a href="https://www.kclu.org/">KCLU</a>/1340 in Santa Barbara and KCLU/88.3 in Thousand Oaks 
 
<p>KTMS/990AM, KTYD/99.9FM, and K231CR/94.1, which relays <a href="https://oldschool1490.com/">KOSJ</a>/1490AM, are still on the air as of Sunday night at 11:15pm. Those are are a short distance farther up Gibraltar Road. (In the other box in the photo above.)</p>
<p>Here is a guide to substitute signals for some of the stations:</p>
 
 KCRW/KDRW can be heard on KCRU/89.1 from Oxnard (actually, Laguna Peak, in Pt. Magu State Park) 
 KDB can be heard on KDSC/91.1 from Thousand Oaks (actually off Sulphur Mountain Road, south of Ojai) 
 KCLU can be heard on 1340 AM from Santa Barbara and 88.3 FM from Thousand Oaks 
 KPCC can be heard on KJAI/89.5 from Ojai (also transmitting from Sulphur Mountai Road) 
 KSBX/KCBX can be heard on 90.9 from Solvang (actually Broadcast Peak) 
 KPFK can be heard on its home signal (biggest in the U.S.) from Mount Wilson in Los Angeles at 90.7 
 KZSB can be heard on 1290 AM from Santa Barbara 
 KMRO can still be heard on its Camarillo main transmitter on 90.3 
 
<p>The two AM signals (marked green in the top list above) are strong in town and most of the FMs are weak but listenable here and there. And all of them can be heard through their live streams online.</p>
<p>Published stories so far, other than this one:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.independent.com/2023/01/11/gibraltar-peak-towers-out-of-commission/">Gibraltar Peak Towers Out of Commission</a>, in the <a href="https://www.independent.com/">Santa Barbara Independent</a>. That story says two power poles were knocked out, as reported by John Franklin, who operates the whole transmitter site. (The story also kindly gives me credit for the photo there.) 
 <a href="https://www.kclu.org/kclus-102-3-fm-signal-in-santa-barbara-is-intermittently-off-the-air">KCLU’s 102.3 FM signal in Santa Barbara is intermittently off the air</a>, on the KCLU website. The image it shows is not of KCLU’s antenna on Gibraltar Peak. Mouse&nbsp;<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/infrastructure/51196612298/in/album-72157719242709298/">over this photo</a> to see which of the many antennas on Gibraltar Peak radiate which signals (to the best of my knowledge, anyway). 
 
<p>The Independent says the site is a “relay” one. That’s correct in the sense that most of the stations there are satellites of bigger stations elsewhere. But KCLU is local to Santa Barbara (its anchor AM station is here), and the ratings reflect it. I wrote about those ratings a few years ago, in <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2019/04/04/public/">Where Public Radio Rocks</a>. In that post, I noted that public radio is bigger in Santa Barbara than anywhere else in the country.</p>
<p>The most recent <a href="https://ratings.radio-online.com/content/arb591">ratings</a> (Spring of 2022), in % shares of total listening, are these:</p>
 
 KDB/93.9, classical music, relaying KUSC/91.1 from Los Angeles: 7.9% 
 KCLU/102.3 and 1340 in Santa Barbara (studios in Thousand Oaks), public broadcasting: 7.3% 
 KDRW/88.7 in Santa Barbara (main studio in Santa Monica, as KCRW/89.9): 4.6% 
 KPCC/89.9, relaying KJAI/89.5 and KPCC/89.3 in Pasadena: 1.3% 
 KSBX/89.5, relaying KCBX/90.1 from San Luis Obispo: 0.7% 
 
<p>Total: 21.8%.</p>
<p>That means more than a fifth of all radio listening in Santa Barbara is to noncommercial and public radio.</p>
<p>And, of all those stations, only KDB/KUSC and KCLU-AM are on the air right now.</p>
<p>By the way, when I check to see how public broadcasting is doing in other markets, nothing is close. Santa Barbara still kicks ass. I think that’s an interesting story, and I haven’t seen anyone report on it, other than here.</p>
 
<p>*Turns out KSBX is off the air permanently, after losing a coverage battle with KPBS/89.5 in San Diego. On December 29, they published a story in print and sound titled&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kcbx.org/health-science-and-technology/2022-12-29/why-is-89-5-ksbx-off-the-air-the-answer-is-in-the-atmosphere">Why is 89.5 KSBX off the air? The answer is in the atmosphere.</a>&nbsp;They blame <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropospheric_propagation#Tropospheric_ducting">tropospheric ducting</a>, which much of the time makes KPBS come in like a local signal. Also, even though KPBS’s transmitter on Soledad Mountain (really more of a hill) above the coast at La Jolla is more than 200 miles away, it does pump out 26,000 watts, while KCBX puts out only 50 watts—and less in some directions. Though the story doesn’t mention it, KJAI, the KPCC relay on 89.5 for Ojai, is audible in Santa Barbara if nothing else is there. So that also didn’t help. By the way, I’m almost certain that the antenna identified as KSBX’s in the story’s photo (which is also one of mine) is actually for KMRO-2. KSBX’s is the one on the left in <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/infrastructure/51197177169/in/album-72157719242709298/">this photo here</a>.</p>

<p>Most of California has just two seasons: rain and fire. Rain is another name for Winter, and it peaks in January. In most years, January in&nbsp;California isn’t any more wet than, say, New York, Miami or Chicago.&nbsp;But every few years California gets monsoons. Big ones. This is one of those years.</p>
<p>The eighteen gallon storage tub in our yard is sixteen inches deep and serves as a rain gauge:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Yesterday morning it was less than half full. While it gathered rain, our devices blasted out alerts with instructions like this:</p>
<p></p>
<p>So we stayed home and watched the Web tell us how the drought was ending:</p>
<p><a href="https://rain.cosbpw.net/sensor/?site_id=105&amp;site=70729dd9-97d4-430a-9271-7b6c195b49be&amp;device_id=9&amp;device=e1b323bd-c4c6-4ea4-b9d1-c775a97ce915"></a></p>
<p>Wasn’t long ago that Lake Cachuna was at 7%.</p>
<p>So that’s good news. The bad news is about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/weather/topstories/roads-turn-to-rivers-as-storms-drench-california-claiming-lives-and-leaving-many-in-the-dark/ar-AA16aly9">floods</a>, <a href="https://www.kron4.com/news/bay-area/california-ocean-piers-collapse-waves-rise-to-35-feet/">ruined piers and wharfs</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/city-of-fallen-trees-storm-damage-visible-across-sacramento/ar-AA16amrh">downed trees</a>, <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/over-135k-people-are-without-power-from-california-storm-see-where-its-hit-the-most/ar-AA16bnwa">power outages</a>, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/levee-breaches-cause-additional-flooding-in-monterey-county-new-evacuations-ordered/">levee breaches</a>. The usual.</p>
<p>It should help to remember that the geology on both coasts is temporary and improvisational. The East Coast south of New England and Long Island (where coastal landforms were mostly dumped there or scraped bare by glaciers in the geologic yesterday) is a stretch of barrier islands that are essentially dunes shifted by storms. Same goes for the Gulf Coast. The West Coast looks more solid, with hills and mountains directly facing the sea. But Pacific storms in Winter routinely feature waves high as houses, pounding against the shores and sea cliffs.</p>
<p>Looking up the coast from Tijuana, within a few hundred years Coronado and Point Loma in San Diego, La Jolla, all the clifftop towns up the coast to Dana Point and Laguna, Palos Verdes Peninsula, Malibu and Point Dume, Carpinteria, the Santa Barbara Mesa and Hope Ranch, all of Isla Vista and UCSB, Pismo and Avila Beaches, all of Big Sur and the Pacific Coast Highway there, Carmel and the Monterey Peninsula, Aptos, Capitola and Santa Cruz, Davenport, Half Moon Bay, Pacifica, the headlands of San Francisco, Muir and Stimson Beaches and Bolinas in Marin, Fort Bragg in Mendicino County, and Crescent City in Humbolt—all in California—will be eaten away partially or entirely by weather and waves. Earthquakes will also weigh in.</p>
<p>The photo up top is of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Conchita,_California">La Conchita</a>, a stupidly located town on the South Coast, west of Ventura, four days after a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Conchita_landslides#2005_La_Conchita_landslide">landslide in 2005</a> took out 13 homes and killed 10 people. All the land above town is a pile of former and future landslides, sure to slide again when the ground is saturated with water. Such as now or soon.</p>
<p>So that’s a long view. For one that spans the next week, visit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.windy.com/">windy.com</a>&nbsp;and slide the elevation up to FL (flight level) 340 (34000 feet):</p>
<p><a href="https://www.windy.com/?200h,41.043,-171.585,4"></a></p>
<p>That yellow river of wind is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_stream">jet stream</a> hauling serious ass straight across the Pacific and into California. Jet streams are why the headwinds and tailwinds you see on seat-back displays showing flight progress on planes often say 100mph or more. Look at Windy before you fly coast to coast or overseas, and you can guess what the flight path will be. You can also see why it may take as little as five hours to get from Dulles to Heathrow, or more than seven hours to come back by a route that touches the Arctic Circle. Your plane is riding, fighting or circumventing high altitude winds that have huge influences on the weather below.</p>
<p>To see how, drop Windy down to the surface:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.windy.com/?41.043,-171.585,4"></a></p>
<p>Those eddies alongside the jet stream are low pressure centers full of the moisture and wind we call storms. They spin along the sides of the jet stream the way dust devils twist up along the sides of highways full of passing trucks. Those two storm centers are spinning toward California and will bring more wind and rain.</p>
<p>Beside the sure damage those will bring, there will be two benefits. One is that California will be as green as Ireland for a few months. The other is that wildflowers will bloom all over the place.</p>
<p>The Death Valley folks are <a href="https://www.nps.gov/deva/learn/nature/wildflower-seasons.htm">hedging their bet</a>, but I’d put money on a nice bloom this Spring. Watch for it.</p>
<p>Bonus link:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.onlyinyourstate.com/northern-california/underground-norcal/">There’s An Underground City Beneath Sacramento In Northern California That Most People Don’t Know About</a>. Excerpt: “…Old Sacramento was built up during the time of the gold rush, but the frequent flooding of this area obliterated its first level time and time again, until finally, the city abandoned that level altogether. It’s both fascinating and creepy to tour the abandoned level…”</p>

<p>Summary: The following is an excerpt from my upcoming book, Learning Digital Identity, which will be available January 2023.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcf092e8f-f95e-49e9-a2f3-59a96cdf06f4_1954x967.jpeg">    </a> <p>The family therapist Salvador Minuchin <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674292367/technometria-20">declared</a>, "The human experience of identity has two elements: a sense of belonging and a sense of being separate." This is as good a description of digital identity as it is of our psychological identity. A digital identity contains data that uniquely describes a person or thing but also contains information about the subject's relationships to other entities.</p><p>To see an example of this, consider the data record that represents your car, stored somewhere in your state or country's computers. This record, commonly called a title, contains a vehicle identification number (VIN) that uniquely identifies the car to which it belongs. In addition, it contains other attributes of the car such as year, make, model, and color. The title also contains relationships: most notably, the title relates the vehicle to a person who owns it. In many places, the title is also a historical document, because it identifies every owner of the car from the time it was made, as well as whether it's been in a flood or otherwise salvaged.</p><p>While fields as diverse as philosophy, commerce, and technology define identity, most are not helpful in building, managing, and using digital identity systems. Instead, we need to define identity functionally, in a way that provides hooks for us to use in making decisions and thinking about problems that arise in digital identity.</p><p>Joe Andrieu, principal at Legendary Requirements, <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot7-toronto/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/five-mental-models-of-identity.md">writes</a> that "identity is how we recognize, remember, and respond to specific people and things. Identity systems acquire, correlate, apply, reason over, and govern information assets of subjects, identifiers, attributes, raw data, and context." This definition is my favorite because it has proven useful over the years in thinking through thorny identity issues.</p><p>The identity record for a car includes attributes that the system uses to recognize it: in this case, the VIN. The title also includes attributes that are useful to people and organizations who care about (that is, need to respond to) the car, including the owner, the state, and potential buyers. The government runs a system for managing titles that is used to create, manage, transfer, and govern vehicles (or, in Andrieu's formulation, remember them). The system is designed to achieve its primary goal (to record valuable property that the state has an interest in taxing and regulating) and secondary goals (protecting potential buyers and creating a way to prove ownership).</p><p>Digital identity management consists of processes for creating, managing, using, and eventually destroying digital records, like the one that contains your car title. These records might identify a person, a car, a computer, a piece of land, or almost anything else. Sometimes they are created simply for inventory purposes, but the more interesting ones are created with other purposes in mind: allowing or denying access to a building, the creation of a file, the transfer of funds, and so on. These relationships and the authorized actions associated with them make digital identities useful, valuable, and sometimes difficult to manage.</p>   <p>Photo Credit: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/loneprimate/300432532">Plate - WHOS_CAR</a> from Lone Primate (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/">CC BY-NC-SA 2.0</a>)</p><p>Tags: <a href="https://www.windley.com/tags/identity">identity</a> <a href="https://www.windley.com/tags/ldid">ldid</a></p>

   So, from the perspective of mastodon, the domain component of your identifier you are known as is determined by which domain serves your actor document rather than the domain serving the original “well known” webfinger document.

  <p>Mastodon is not the fediverse and in my <a href="https://herestomwiththeweather.com/2022/12/23/check_webfinger/">check_webfinger!</a> post, I’m afraid I made that assumption.  In particular, I concluded</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So, from the perspective of mastodon, the domain component of your identifier you are known as is determined by which domain serves your actor document rather than the domain serving the original “well known” webfinger document.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>which is not necessarily true if you consider the fediverse outside of Mastodon.</p>

<p>Instead, it seems that I should have said that the domain component of your identifier is determined by the domain component of the subject field returned in the webfinger response from the domain that serves your actor document when mastodon makes its 2nd webfinger request which is done in the <a href="https://github.com/herestomwiththeweather/mastodon/blob/main/app/services/activitypub/fetch_remote_actor_service.rb#L48">check_webfinger!</a> method.</p>

  <code>  def check_webfinger!
    webfinger                            = webfinger!("acct:#{@username}@#{@domain}")
    confirmed_username, confirmed_domain = split_acct(webfinger.subject)
</code> 
 

<p>In the code above, the @domain passed to webfinger! is the domain of the server providing the activitypub actor document but the confirmed_domain can be different (e.g. your personal domain) if your original “well known” webfinger document was not pointing to a Mastodon server for providing the actor document.</p>

<p>Therefore, if you have a static personal website, it is not necessary to also host the actor document there as long as the fediverse node providing the actor document is smart enough to provide your personal domain in the subject when mastodon makes a webfinger call to it.  A caveat is that such a fediverse node accomodating personal domains would not be able to distinguish between bob@a.com and bob@b.com when mastodon webfingers server.com for bob@server.com.</p>

  I have explored <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/post/mapping-identity-and-privacy-on-peak-paradox">privacy and identity in a previous post</a>, taken from the perspective of the individual.&nbsp; <p>This post is from the perspective of the state/ nation/ law. I commented on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/privacyshaman/">Michael Becker's</a> LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7014675467131654144/">post</a> about his list of words and definitions for the <a href="https://identitypraxis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IdP_PDI_Key_Terms_To_Support_Business_Strategy_For_2023_and_Beyond-Report_31DEC22-3.pdf.">identity/ privacy space</a>. I commented that everyone remains fixated on making their particular solution work to a problem the user has not got which is "#privacy." Whilst every language and country has an ideal notion of privacy, the wide variety of cultures means there is no unified “concept of privacy”, even if privacy is explicitly named or defined in their specific language law or culture.</p><p>I asked #chatGPT, the “AI” bot from Google, the question, “how would a capitalist and socialist view privacy?”&nbsp;</p><p>“Capitalists would see privacy as an important aspect of individual liberty and autonomy and they view privacy as a property right that can be traded or sold, and they may support policies that allow companies to collect and use personal data as long as they have obtained the necessary consent.</p><p>A socialist would define privacy as the right to personal autonomy and control over one's own thoughts, feelings, and personal information. It is the ability to make decisions about how and with whom one shares personal information, without interference or coercion from external forces such as the government or capitalist institutions. In a socialist society, privacy would be protected as a fundamental human right and would be respected and upheld by the community as a whole.”</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stjohndeakins/">StJohn Deakins</a> added to the comments by suggesting we move on from ideals of the political spectrum to examples.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Korea:&nbsp; dictatorship with command economy:&nbsp; Kim owns you and owns your data, including your thoughts (rights to brain data will become a seriously scary "thing" in the next decade)</p><p>China: one-party state, ruling on behalf of 'the people’ with a state-controlled market economy: the party owns you and your data (on behalf of the Chinese people)</p><p>USA: individualist democracy with a free market (where companies have the same legal rights as individuals).&nbsp; You own your data, and others own it, too (lots of them).</p><p>EU:&nbsp; social democracy with a free market (where markets serve people, and people choose how). You own your data (as a human right). You, in theory, participate in choosing how.</p><br><p>It is remarkably common that concepts can be well-defined in language and law, but there remains to be a wide variance in the understanding and use. Words and language are dynamic and never stationary, and we should not try to own or control them,&nbsp; defining for a context is critical. &nbsp; Just consider love, truth, safety, honesty, work, trust, beauty and risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Plotting Privacy on the <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/">Peak-Paradox</a> framework makes me consider how the different interruptions are framed by the purposes presented in the mapping.&nbsp; It is evident that the interruption for privacy must vary as we move about our understanding of what we are optimising for. Within Peaks, such as the Peak Individual Purpose, there is a creation of dilemmas, for example, Mark Zuckerberg, who wants privacy for himself but not for any of his #meta users.</p><p></p><p>To add an additional layer to the complexity onion of privacy, it should be noted that the concept of privacy probably exists in each of us until there is an external demand or constraint.&nbsp; As unpacked in this <a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo/we-can-be-very-good-at-answering-questions-but-why-dont-we-challenge-them-cd55f12504bc">post</a>, where I pick up on the work of two behavioural scientists, John Darley and Daniel Batson, who published in 1973 “From Jerusalem to Jericho: A study of Situational and Dispositional Variables in Helping Behavior.” It was an investigation into the psychology of prosocial behaviour. The research demonstrates that when we introduce time pressure, our dispositional factors (I like privacy) stand for nothing and that we will act differently because of the constraints.&nbsp;</p><p>When you design for privacy, you need to understand what the user is optimising for and be aware that your design will change what privacy means to the users because it is a constraint. </p> <br>

Oh, we don’t have that data!</p><p>But we can create constraints that mean we get biased data as we don’t understand human behaviour in context.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>----</p><p>In 1973 two behavioural scientists, John Darley and Daniel Batson published "<a href="https://faculty.babson.edu/krollag/org_site/soc_psych/darley_samarit.html">From Jerusalem to Jericho: A study of Situational and Dispositional Variables in Helping Behavior</a>." It was an investigation into the psychology of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosocial_behavior">prosocial behaviour</a>.</p><p>Darley and Batson picked students who were studying to be priests at the Princeton Theological Seminary to determine how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribution_(psychology)">situational factors</a> influenced prosocial behaviour. Hypothesis: When someone is kind to another, is that because he or she has some innate qualities that lead to kindness—or because some situational factors simply determine and allow for kind behaviours.</p><p>The famous study was across three days in late fall; they had a bunch of seminary students come to a building, meet with a researcher, and fill out a bunch of surveys. The surveys partly addressed if the students were religious primarily for intrinsic or for extrinsic reasons (with “intrinsic reasons” being like “I am motivated to do good in the world” and “extrinsic reasons” being like “I really want to get into heaven.”). Then the participants were told that they needed to prepare a brief talk about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_Good_Samaritan">The Good Samaritan</a> — which is a story about how a hapless victim on the side of the road was just passed by holy individuals, whilst a non-holy Samaritan took the time to stop and help the fellow out. The story's context is significant as the participants were told that they needed to walk to a nearby building to meet up with another team member and then give their sermon. However, using random selection, the student was told that they:</p>  <p>Had plenty of time, and were early.</p>  <p>Were on time, but should head over now so as not to be late, or</p>  <p>We're running late, and really needed to run without delay - no excuse.</p>  <p>Obviously, the situation was rigged, and all participants found a fallen stranger (an actor) in a narrow alleyway who acted sick on the ground and in need of help. The narrow alleyway was selected as there was a choice: help this guy or step over him!</p><p>The “time constraint” crafted behavioural change as:</p>  <p>63% of participants in the “early” condition stopped to help the stranger.</p>  <p>45% of participants in the “on-time” condition stopped to help the stranger.</p>  <p>10% of participants in the “late” condition stopped to help the stranger.</p>  <p>60% of the participants were unwilling to help the “victim.” This is ironic because the participants were Princeton students studying to be priests and about to give a talk on the lessons of the Good Samaritan, but this was manipulated because of the constraints.</p><p>A side note before the core finding is that dispositional factors (what you believed) had no bearing on helping behaviour. In other words, people who reported as religious for intrinsic reasons were no more likely than others to stop to help.</p><p>When it comes to human behaviour, we have a strong bias toward thinking that people do what they do because of internal traits that drive their behaviours (<a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar_url?url=https://www.academia.edu/download/44555984/The_Overconfidence_Effect_in_Social_Pred20160408-26208-183abhi.pdf&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uTG0Y4XNFbiVy9YPs4i3gAs&amp;scisig=AAGBfm0h9KIeZBrdoprM3zslLQV3M3g86g&amp;oi=scholarr">Dunning, Ross &amp; Nisbett, 1990</a>). The Overconfidence Effect in Social Prediction.&nbsp; Data shows us that dispositional factors are relatively weak predictors of what we do, whilst situational factors (which we cannot see or measure and often seem benign or inconsequential) play a powerful role in shaping our behaviours.</p><br><p>We can only answer the question we have data to, but that does not mean the answer is right or the data is a good predictor because we don't understand the constraints.&nbsp;</p> CEO Take Away <p>If data supports your decisions, who is accountable and responsible for ensuring it answers the question we want and is not just data without context?&nbsp; In the next board agenda, put an item as part of AOB, “Do we understand situational bias in our data?” If there is no debate or looks of bewilderment, perhaps it is time to ask better questions of those who think that the data is accurate.&nbsp;</p><br><br><br><br><br>

Then agree to the terms of service and agree to get emails (or not).</p>  <p>Enter the four-digit code that was sent to the email address you gave in (1).</p>  <p>Solve the captcha.</p>  <p>Choose whether to use 2FA or security questions to secure your account. I chose 2FA.</p>  <p>Verify your phone number using SMS or WhatsApp (they recommend WhatsApp). I chose SMS.</p>  <p>Enter the 4 digit code they send.</p>  <p>Continue with 2FA. I'm not sure why this screen shows up twice.</p>  <p>Logout and log back in.</p>  <p>Scan the QR code to set up a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_one-time_password">TOTP</a> authenticator.</p>  <p>Enter the one-time code from the authenticator app.</p>  <p>Upload a photo and enter a mailing address (yes, they're required).</p>  <p>Congratulations! You've gone through Guru's twelve step program and you're registered! I went through all this just to discover I can't answer questions unless I pay them money. I bailed.</p><p>As I was going though this, I couldn't help thinking how much easier it could be using verifiable credentials.</p>  <p>Enter an email.</p>  <p>Scan the QR code they present using my <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2022/12/wallets_and_agents.shtml">smart wallet</a> to establish a DID connection.</p>  <p>Verify information about myself that they ask for using verifiable credentials.</p>  <p>Credentials asserting your verified email and phone number would be easy enough to get if I don't already have them. And they've not verifying address and photo anyway, so there's no need for anything but a self-asserted credential for that. Admittedly, if I've never used verifiable credentials before they need to coach me on getting a wallet and the phone and email address credential. But they're already doing that for the authenticator app in step 10 above.</p><p>Guru's registration process is one of the most arduous I have encountered. If I were them and unwilling to use verifiable credentials, I'd at least split it up and let people add their photo, address, and authenticator app after they're already on board. Guru.com (and lots of other web sites) have to be shedding potential customers at every step in their onboarding process. I wonder if they keep track of abandoned registrations and where it happens? Does anyone? I'd love to know the numbers.</p><p>Verifiable credentials could make the onboarding experience a breeze, get more customers in the door, and reduce the cost of customer support calls associated with it.</p>   <p>Photo Credit: <a href="https://publicdomainpictures.net/en/view-image.php?image=114574&amp;picture=abandoned-road&amp;large=1">Abandoned Road</a> from Tim Emerich (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0</a>)</p><p>Tags: <a href="https://www.windley.com/tags/verifiable+credentials">verifiable+credentials</a> <a href="https://www.windley.com/tags/ssi">ssi</a> <a href="https://www.windley.com/tags/identity">identity</a> <a href="https://www.windley.com/tags/web">web</a></p>

<p>In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2022/12/22/lists-and-people-on-mastodon/">Lists and people on Mastodon</a> I showed how I added a list column to the following tab of the Mastodon browser I’m building. That was a step in the direction of easier and more powerful list management. It enables me to see whether the people I follow are assigned to lists, and to consider who should be on a list (or perhaps on a different list). </p>
<p>Today, as I began to use that new affordance in earnest, I discovered a new challenge. In order to assign someone to a list, or change a list assignment, I clicked the link in the account_url column to open that person’s profile in the Mastodon web app. That was fine for accounts on my home server, mastodon.social. An account URL like Shelley Powers’ <a href="https://mastodon.social/@burningbird">https://mastodon.social/@burningbird</a> brings me to Shelley’s profile on my home server where the list manager is available. </p>
<p>But if I’m following someone elsewhere, like Ward Cunningham at <a href="https://mastodon.radio/@k9ox">https://mastodon.radio/@k9ox</a>, the account URL brings me to Ward’s profile on that server where the list manager isn’t available. In order to assign Ward to a list I had to capture his account URL, paste it into the search box in my home server’s web app, and then click the resulting link: <a href="https://mastodon.social/@k9ox@mastodon.radio">https://mastodon.social/@k9ox@mastodon.radio</a>.</p>
<p>That got old real fast, so I adjusted the following tab to display the latter flavor of URL which I’ll call an instance-qualified URL. </p>
<p>Steampipe provides a few ways to make that adjustment. As a user of the <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-mastodon-insights">dashboard</a>, you can use Postgres’ regular expression functions to do the transformation in the SQL query that drives the view. But you’d rather not have to. It’s much nicer if the <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-mastodon-insights">plugin</a> does that for you, so the SQL can just refer to a column called instance_qualified_url. </p>
<p>I chose the latter approach. As the author of a Steampipe plugin you want to make life as easy as possible for users of the plugin. When you’re the author of both the plugin and the dashboard, as I am in this case, you can enjoy a nice virtuous cycle. As the dashboard evolves you discover ways to improve the plugin, which leads to more use of the dashboard, which suggests further opportunities to improve the plugin. I have been greatly enjoying the coevolution of these two components!</p>
 Adding a new column to a Steampipe table 
<p>To make the change, I extended the structure that defines the columns of the tables mapped from Mastodon <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/entities/Account/">Account API</a>. A Steampipe plugin defines columns using a list of structs like this.</p>
 ...,
{
	Name:        "url",
	Type:        proto.ColumnType_STRING,
	Description: "URL for the account.",
},
...,
 
<p>That struct says: “When the name of a top-level field in the API response is url, tell Steampipe to make a database column with that name and with the Postgres type text.” </p>
<p>You can also transform values in API responses to synthesize new columns that don’t appear in API responses. Here’s the struct I added for this case.</p>
 ...,
{	
	Name:        "instance_qualified_account_url",
	Type:        proto.ColumnType_STRING,
	Description: "Account URL prefixed with my instance.",
	Transform:   transform.FromValue().Transform(instanceQualifiedAccountUrl),
},
...
 
<p>That one says: “Send the API response to the transform function instanceQualifiedAccountUrl, and use its result as the value of the column.</p>
<p>Here’s the function.</p>
 func instanceQualifiedAccountUrl(ctx context.Context, input *transform.TransformData) (interface{}, error) {
	url := input.Value.(*mastodon.Status).Account.URL
	qualifiedUrl := qualifiedUrl(ctx, url)
	return qualifiedUrl, nil
}
 
<p>It delegates the real work to another function.</p>
 func qualifiedUrl(ctx context.Context, url string) string {
	plugin.Logger(ctx).Debug("instanceQualifiedUrl", "server", homeServer, "url", url)
	re := regexp.MustCompile(`https://([^/]+)/@(.+)`)
	matches := re.FindStringSubmatch(url)
	if len(matches) == 0 {
		return url
	}
	person := matches[1]
	server := matches[2]
	qualifiedUrl := fmt.Sprintf("%s/@%s@%s", homeServer, server, person)
	plugin.Logger(ctx).Debug("instanceQualifiedUrl", "qualifiedUrl", qualifiedUrl)
	schemelessHomeServer := strings.ReplaceAll(homeServer, "https://", "")
	qualifiedUrl = strings.ReplaceAll(qualifiedUrl, "@"+schemelessHomeServer, "")
	plugin.Logger(ctx).Debug("qualifiedUrl", "qualifiedUrl", qualifiedUrl)
	return qualifiedUrl
}
 
<p>Why? Two different sets of column definitions need the same transformation. instanceQualifiedAccountUrl works with responses from the Account API. But account URLs also appear in the <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/entities/Status/">Status API</a> that drives timeline views. Those use a different transform function, instanceQualifiedStatusUrl, to do the same transformation for a different API response.</p>
 From account URLs to status URLs 
<p>The instanceQualifiedAccountUrl column solved the original problem. I was able to remove my plugin-author hat, put on my dashboard-author hat, and refer to account urls as instance-qualified URLs in all the tabs that display them. Any such link now leads to a profile that I view through the lens of mastodon.social and that enables me to use the web app’s list manager directly, without the cumbersome copy/paste/search procedure.</p>
<p>My happy dance didn’t last long, though. Newly sensitized to that copy/paste/search friction, I realized it was still happening when I try to reply to items that appear in a timeline view. Here is a recent example: <a href="https://techpolicy.social/@mnot/109610641523489182">https://techpolicy.social/@mnot/109610641523489182</a>.</p>
<p>That’s the URL displayed in the dashboard. When I click it I land on Mark’s server and can view the item, but if I try to reply I’m confronted with the dreaded copy/paste/search operation.</p>
<p>No problem! I’ll use a similar transform! Not so fast. I can form an URL like <a href="https://mastodon.social/@mnot@techpolicy.social/109610641523489182">https://mastodon.social/@mnot@techpolicy.social/109610641523489182</a> but it doesn’t go anywhere. </p>
<p>If I do the copy/paste/search operation, I land on a similar-but-different URL: <a href="https://mastodon.social/@mnot@techpolicy.social/109610641692667630">https://mastodon.social/@mnot@techpolicy.social/109610641692667630</a>. It has the same structure but a different toot ID. This URL is also the one that appears in the web app’s home timeline, which is why I can reply directly from that view. </p>
<p>I’m out of my depth here so I’ll just end with an appeal for help. It makes sense that a home server will assign its own id to an item fetched from a foreign server, and that the web app will use that id. But I’m not seeing a way to aquire that id directly from the API. I suspect it’s possible to acquire it by way of search, but doing that for every item in a timeline will quickly exhaust the tight budget for API requests (just 300 every 5 minutes).</p>
<p>So, Lazy Mastodon, am I just stuck here or is there a way to transform foreign status URLs into instance-relative status URLs?</p>
 Update: Solved! 
<p>After <a href="https://mastodon.social/@judell/109610845971691248">chatting with Jari Pennanen</a> I took another look and realized the needed ID was available in the API response after all, I just wasn’t using it (facepalm). And in fact there are two flavors of the ID — one for original toots, another for boosts. Columns for both cases are added <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-mastodon/commit/c3f7e64f5353a1bd09e4db76e0ff4b08792478ff">here</a> and the tweak to make the dashboard use them <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-mastodon-insights/commit/204b1b61c30f399627661ec7a954920594fc3e97">here</a>.</p>
<p>Here is the result.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/instance-qualified-url.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>Thanks for being my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">rubber duck</a>, Jari! The instance-qualified toot and reblog URLs make this dashboard massively more useful.</p>

It can charge up to 6 devices simultaneously and is said to work in more than 200 countries. (I will never travel that much, so I'm taking OneAdapter.com's word for it.)<br><p></p><p>In keeping with how charging interfaces are evolving, the OneWorld 65 has two standard USB-C charging ports, 2 USB-A charing ports, and a 65-watt USB-C charging port for the newer laptops that support USB-C.</p><p>In late November and early December, I traveled to Austria, eventually joining the American Beethoven Society on a tour of musical landmarks, including a week in Vienna, and a side trip to Salzburg. Pictured here is the One World 65 in action in my Vienna hotel. To use, I selected between European Union, UK, or U.S. plugs (in Austria, it was EU all the way) and found the OneWorld 65 to plug easily into all such power outlets in various hotel rooms. The USB ports are on the bottom of the unit, and one is on the right side. I didn't come close to using all six outlets at once, but it's great to have the capacity.<br><br>I had one issue, and it wasn't a deal-breaker. I attempted to plug some 110-volt U.S. plugs into the outlet provided on the top of the front as pictured, but was unable to do so. When I returned to the U.S., I contacted OneAdaptr.com, and they suggested I use more force to insert such plugs. I tried various 110-volt plugs at home, and while I did have success with one such plug, I could not insert other plugs I tried, no matter how much force I applied. The blue plastic inside acts as a protection guard, and perhaps with repeated use, I will find it easier to insert any such plug.<br><br>Despite this issue, I recommend the OneWorld 65 for international travel. It's great to see so much versality in such a small package selling for less than $70. It travels well, and I will put it through its paces again in 2023.</p>

<p>I lasted tweeted on Dec 22. (It was, unsurprisingly, a link to a blog post about Mastodon.) Today I wondered what percentage of the people who appear in my Mastodon timeline today also appeared on Twitter today. </p>
<p>To start, I wrote this query which tries to match Twitter and Mastodon usernames. When it finds a match, it reports the day on which that person last tweeted.</p>
 with mastodon as (
  select
    substring(username from 1 for 15) as username, -- twitter names are max 15 chars
    'from:' || substring(username from 1 for 15) as query -- we will query twitter using, e.g., 'from:judell'
  from
    mastodon_toot
  where
    timeline = 'home'
  limit
    500
)
select
  m.username as mastodon_person,
  t.author-&gt;&gt;'username' as twitter_person,
  max(to_char(t.created_at, 'YYYY-MM-DD')) as last_tweet_day
from 
  mastodon m
left join
  twitter_search_recent t -- see https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/twitter/tables/twitter_search_recent
on
  t.query = m.query
group by
  mastodon_person,
  twitter_person
order by
  last_tweet_day desc
 
<p>This is my favorite kind of Steampipe query: two different APIs, each represented as a Postgres table, combined with a SQL JOIN.</p>
<p>The result looks like this, with nulls for failed matches.</p>
 +-----------------+-----------------+----------------+
| mastodon_person | twitter_person  | last_tweet_day |
+-----------------+-----------------+----------------+
| AlanSill        | null            | null           |
| Colarusso       | null            | null           |
| ...                                                |
| williamgunn     | null            | null           |
| xian            | null            | null           |
| ...                                                |
| futurebird      | futurebird      | 2022-12-29     |
| glynmoody       | glynmoody       | 2022-12-29     |
| ...                                                |

| blaine          | blaine          | 2022-12-23     |
+-----------------+-----------------+----------------+
 
<p>Next I created a table from the above query.</p>
 create table public.mastodon_twitter as 
  -- sql as above
 
<p>And then ran this query.</p>
 select
  last_tweet_day,
  count(*)
from
  mastodon_twitter
where
  last_tweet_day is not null
group by
  last_tweet_day
order by
  last_tweet_day desc
 
<p>Here’s the result.</p>
 +----------------+-------+
| last_tweet_day | count |
+----------------+-------+
| 2022-12-29     | 36    |
| 2022-12-28     | 6     |
| 2022-12-27     | 1     |
| 2022-12-26     | 1     |
| 2022-12-25     | 2     |
| 2022-12-23     | 2     |
+----------------+-------+
 
<p>The 500 toots represented here were created by 93 people who tooted today.</p>
 select count(*) from mastodon_twitter

+-------+
| count |
+-------+
| 93    |
+-------+
 
<p>Of those 93 people, 48 have matching usernames. </p>
 select count(*) from mastodon_twitter where last_tweet_day is not null

+-------+
| count |
+-------+
| 48    |
+-------+
 
<p>Of the 48 with matching usernames, 36 also tweeted today. </p>
<p>So there’s my answer: 75% of the people who appeared in my Mastodon home timeline (when I sampled it just now) also appeared on Twitter today.</p>

<p>On a hike today my friend noticed a clump of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanita_muscaria">Amanita Muscaria</a> and took away this glorious specimen. As we headed down the trail he said: “I can never see one of these without hearing the music from Super Mario Brothers — beep, boop.” He went on to explain that the spotted red mushroom was a coveted power-up that made Mario grow large.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/super-mario-amanita.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>I knew nothing about this. I have never played Super Mario Brothers, or any other iconic game, or really any computer-based game at all, except briefly in the early 1990s when I played Rogue during an office craze that lasted a few weeks, and around the same time played <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Putt-Putt_(series)">Putt-Putt</a> with our young kids. </p>
<p>This seems unusual for someone like me. I have spent my adult life deeply engrossed in computer-based activity, and am often described to others, by friends and family, as a “computer guy.” That makes me a geek and/or nerd by definition. But I’ve never been comfortable with either of those terms. </p>
<p>Over the years I’ve known a great many others in the geek/nerd tribe who self-identify as gamers. It always puzzles me. I’m perfectly happy to spend long hours in front of a screen reading or writing or coding. But games? I simply lack that gene. It baffles me how other members of the tribe — especially adults who like me already put in long hours in front of screens — could then pile up more screen time playing games, when they could be outside hiking, or cycling, or gardening, or doing really anything else at all.</p>
<p>Perhaps this explains my reluctance to self-identify as a member of the geek/nerd tribe. If I really belonged I’d be gamer. Since I’m not I must be an impostor. I wonder if there’s a word — in some other language than English probably — for when you share certain core attributes with a tribe but not others?</p>

   The notes I made in Mastodon Discovery skipped over a noteworthy step.  In general, after mastodon fetches and parses the “well known” webfinger document (the so-called JSON Resource Descriptor), there is a 3 step process to learn about the actor referenced in that document.

  <p>The notes I made in <a href="https://herestomwiththeweather.com/2022/11/15/mastodon-discovery/">Mastodon Discovery</a> skipped over a noteworthy step.  In general, after mastodon fetches and parses the “well known” webfinger document (the so-called JSON Resource Descriptor), there is a 3 step process to learn about the actor referenced in that document.</p>

 
   fetch_resource 
   check_webfinger! 
   create_account 
 

<p>As mentioned previously, in the first step, a very comprehensive json document for the actor is fetched and in the third step, an account is created for that actor if does not already exist.  However, between those two steps, mastodon does another webfinger lookup since, for instance, the domain serving the actor document may be a different domain than the one that originally served the first “well known” webfinger document.  Prior to this check, <a href="https://github.com/herestomwiththeweather/mastodon/blob/main/app/services/activitypub/fetch_remote_actor_service.rb#L32">some instance variables are set</a>:</p>

  <code>    @uri      = @json['id']
    @username = @json['preferredUsername']
    @domain   = Addressable::URI.parse(@uri).normalized_host
</code> 
 
<p>The @uri instance variable is the location of the actor document and the @domain instance variable is the domain that serves the actor document.  After these variables are set, <a href="https://github.com/herestomwiththeweather/mastodon/blob/main/app/services/activitypub/fetch_remote_actor_service.rb#L36">the check is performed</a>:</p>

  <code>    check_webfinger! unless only_key
</code> 
 
<p>This check enforces that the domain component of your identifier is the domain that serves your actor document. (It <a href="https://github.com/herestomwiththeweather/mastodon/blob/main/app/services/activitypub/fetch_remote_actor_service.rb#L48">inspects the subject of the “well known” document</a> and if the username and domain of the subject match the instance variables above, the ‘self’ resource link is required to be the same as the @uri instance variable.  If the subject does not match, one more webfinger lookup for the redirection is allowed.)</p>

<p>So, from the perspective of mastodon, the domain component of your identifier you are known as is determined by which domain serves your actor document rather than the domain serving the original “well known” webfinger document.  It seems if your domain is a static site and you want to be known by an identifier associated with your domain, your domain needs to serve the actor document in addition to “well known” webfinger document.</p>

<p>Lately I've been using Apple Keynote to create graphics for using in videos and blog posts. It's a quick way to arrange things on a page, copying and pasting most things just works, and there are enough built in shapes and tools to get the point across. However, after spending a full day creating graphics for a video, I found myself frustrated by the number of clicks required to export a single slide at a time.</p>

<p>I posted a <a href="https://aaronparecki.com/2022/12/21/17/keynote">quick note</a> about this, and immediately got a lot of helpful replies! A lot of people suggested it should be possible to automate with <a href="https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/">KeyboardMaestro</a>, a tool I was not previously familiar with. It was also suggested that I ask on the KeyboardMaestro forums, so I did, and also quickly received <a href="https://forum.keyboardmaestro.com/t/export-current-keynote-slide-as-png/30317?u=aaronpk">a very detailed reply</a>!</p>

<p>In the course of reading through these replies, I realized that the thing they all had in common was AppleScript! One reply in particular <a href="https://twitter.com/chris79/status/1605933706778185730">from Chris</a> contained a pretty detailed AppleScript that appears to have been adapted from the <a href="https://iworkautomation.com/keynote/document-export.html">iworkautomation</a> website. So I took that as a starting point and wanted to see how I could make it work without also using KeyboardMaestro.</p>

 Create a Quick Action in Automator 

<p>First, open Automator and create a new Quick Action.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In the new action that is created, set the "Workflow receives" option to no input, and choose Keynote.app in the application list.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Then search for the AppleScript action and drag it into the empty grey area.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next, replace the <code>(* Your script goes here *)</code> text with the following AppleScript.</p>

 AppleScript to export the current slide as a PNG in Keynote 

 <code>set the defaultDestinationFolder to (path to downloads folder)

tell application "Keynote"
    activate
    try
        set currentSlideNumber to the slide number of (get the current slide of the front document)

        --- skip all but the current slide
        tell the front document
            set skipped of ¬
                (every slide where the slide number is not equal to currentSlideNumber) to true
        end tell

        --- capture the document name
        set documentName to the name of the front document
        if documentName ends with ".key" then ¬
            set documentName to text 1 thru -5 of documentName

        --- create an empty folder to temporarily store the image
        tell application "Finder"
            set newFolderName to documentName &amp; " slide " &amp; currentSlideNumber
            set incrementIndex to 1
            repeat until not (exists folder newFolderName of defaultDestinationFolder)
                set newFolderName to documentName &amp; "-" &amp; (incrementIndex as string)
                set incrementIndex to incrementIndex + 1
            end repeat
            set the targetFolder to ¬
                make new folder at defaultDestinationFolder with properties ¬
                    {name:newFolderName}
            set the targetFolderHFSPath to targetFolder as string
        end tell

        --- tell Keynote to export the current slide
        export the front document as slide images to file targetFolderHFSPath with properties ¬
            {image format:PNG, skipped slides:false}

        --- set all the slides back to unskipped
        tell the front document
            set skipped of every slide to false
        end tell

        --- move the file to the destination folder and delete the temporary folder 
        tell application "Finder"
            set folderContents to every item of targetFolder
            repeat with theFile in folderContents
                set fileExtension to name extension of theFile
                set fileName to the name of theFile as string
                set splitCharacters to ".001"

                set ATID to AppleScript's text item delimiters
                set AppleScript's text item delimiters to splitCharacters
                set newFileName to text item 1 of fileName
                set AppleScript's text item delimiters to ATID

                set newFileName to newFileName &amp; "." &amp; fileExtension
                set name of theFile to newFileName
                -- display dialog quoted form of (name of theFile as string)

            end repeat
            move files of entire contents of targetFolder to defaultDestinationFolder with replacing
            delete targetFolder

            --- open the destination folder
            tell application "Finder"
                set thePath to file (defaultDestinationFolder &amp; newFileName as string)
                activate
                reveal the thePath
            end tell
        end tell

    on error errorMessage number errorNumber
        display alert "EXPORT PROBLEM" message errorMessage
        error number -128
    end try
end tell

</code> 

 Setting up a keyboard shortcut 

<p>In the Automator app, save this quick action with a name like <code>ExportCurrentSlide</code>. You can quit Automator now.</p>

<p>Now open System Preferences, open the Keyboard options, and go to the Shortcuts tab, then click on Services. Your new action should appear at the bottom of the list.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click on the "none" at the right side of the action and you can record a keyboard shortcut for the action. I used "Shift Command 9" for mine.</p>

<p>Close this, and go to Keynote to test it out!</p>

<p>Choose the slide you want to export and press your keyboard shortcut! You should see a quick sequence of hiding all the slides, un-hiding them, and then the Downloads folder should pop up with your file name including the Keynote file name and slide number!</p>

<p></p>

<p>There you go! A pure AppleScript solution, no third party apps needed! I just finished setting this up this morning and I'm already so much happier exporting slides now!</p>

<p>I hadn’t thought to use Mastodon lists until I read the Frustration with lists chapter of Martin Fowler’s <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/exploring-mastodon.html">Exploring Mastodon</a>, in which he writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
I like lists because they allow me to divide up my timeline to topics I want to read about at different times. They are frustrating because the tools to manage them in Twitter are very limited, so it’s more hassle to set up the kind of environment I’d like. Mastodon also has lists, sadly its current management tools are equally bad.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This seemed like a good challenge for Steampipe. To tackle it, I first needed to add some new tables to the plugin to encapsulate the list APIs: <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-mastodon/blob/main/docs/tables/mastodon_list.md">mastodon_list</a> and <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-mastodon/blob/main/docs/tables/mastodon_list_account.md">mastodon_list_account</a>. I’ll save that story for another time. Here I’ll just show that together they enable queries like this.</p>
 select
  l.title as list,
  array_agg(a.username order by a.username) as people
from
  mastodon_list l
join
  mastodon_list_account a
on
  l.id = a.list_id
group by
  l.title

<p>That’s a useful view, and I’ve now included it, but it didn’t address Martin’s specific need.</p>
<blockquote><p>
To manage these lists, I really need a display that shows every account that I follow in a table with its lists. That way I can easily see which list each account is on, and spot any accounts that aren’t on a list.
</p></blockquote>
<p>For that I needed to add a list column to the Following tab. </p>
<p>This was the original query.</p>
 select
  url,
  case when display_name = '' then username else display_name end as person,
  to_char(created_at, 'YYYY-MM-DD') as since,
  followers_count as followers,
  following_count as following,
  statuses_count as toots,
  note
from
  mastodon_following
order by
  person
 
<p>The new version captures the above join of mastodon_list and mastodon_list_account, and joins that to the mastodon_following (people I follow) table. It’s a left join which means I’ll always get all the people I follow. If you’re not on a list, your list column will be null.</p>
 with data as (
  select
    l.title as list,
    a.*
  from
    mastodon_list l
  join
    mastodon_list_account a
  on
    l.id = a.list_id
),
combined as (
  select
    d.list,
    f.url,
    case when f.display_name = '' then f.username else f.display_name end as person,
    to_char(f.created_at, 'YYYY-MM-DD') as since,
    f.followers_count as followers,
    f.following_count as following,
    f.statuses_count as toots,
    f.note
  from
    mastodon_following f
  left join
    data d
  on
    f.id = d.id
)
select
  *
from
  combined
order by
  person
 
<p>That query drives the new version of the Following tab.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/mastodon-following-with-lists.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>It’s pretty sparse, I’ve only just begun adding people to lists. And honestly I’m not sure I’ll want to keep doing this curation, it’s the kind of thing that can become a burden, I need to play around some more before I commit. Meanwhile, the default sort puts unlisted people first so they’re easy to find. </p>
<p>To provide a better way to find people who are on lists, I expanded the List tab in a couple of ways. It had included a dropdown of lists by which to filter the home timeline. Now that dropdown has counts of people on each list.</p>
 input "list" {
  type = "select"
  width = 2
  sql = &lt;&lt;EOQ
    with list_account as (
      select
        l.title
      from
        mastodon_list l
      join
          mastodon_list_account a
      on
        l.id = a.list_id
    ),
    counted as (
      select
        title,
        count(*)
      from
        list_account
      group by
        title
      order by
        title
    )
    select
      title || ' (' || count || ')' as label,
      title as value
    from
      counted
    order by
      title
  EOQ
}
 
<p>I also used this query to expand the List tab.</p>
 select
  l.title as list,
  array_to_string( array_agg( lower(a.username) order by lower(a.username)), ', ') as people
from
  mastodon_list l
join
  mastodon_list_account a
on
  l.id = a.list_id
group by
  l.title
 
<p>The result is the list / people table on the right.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/expanded-list-view.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>I know that some won’t cotton to this SQL-forward programming model. But for others who will, I wanted to show a few detailed examples to give you a sense of what’s possible at the intersection of Mastodon and Steampipe. </p>
<p>If you’re not tuned into SQL (like I wasn’t for a very long time), here’s your takeaway: as SQL goes, this stuff is not too scary. Yes there are joins, yes there’s an array_agg that transposes a column into a list. It’s not beginner SQL. But lots of people know how to use join and array_agg in these ways, lots more could easily learn how, and with SQL ascendant nowadays these are skills worth having. </p>

<p>The tension between interoperability and innovation holds IDtech products hostage. Here’s my take on what to do about&nbsp;it.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/es/@sgoodgame?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Sam Goodgame</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/boulders?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a><p>New technologies need to provide unique value to be adopted. Web5, which I use as shorthand for verifiable credentials, decentralized identifiers, and personal data stores, offers “an extra decentralized web platform.” Unfortunately, simply being more decentralized or “self-sovereign” doesn’t generally lead to unique value being realized by end-users. The real end-goal of web5 is a universally-accepted and useful digital ID–a goal only achievable through interoperability. Thus, the unique value of web5 is interoperability, or more precisely, the extreme convenience and high trust interoperability delivers to identity products.</p><p>But herein lies a “<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/catch-22">Catch-22</a>”: developers won’t adopt new technology unless it adds unique value, but interoperability requires widespread adoption to pay dividends. It’s the classic network effect, or chicken-and-egg, problem. I call it the Catch-22 of Adoption.</p><p>But there is another, highly-related, highly-pernicious, and less-obvious Catch-22 keeping web5 from breaking out and realizing its true potential. I call it the Catch-22 of Interoperability.</p> The Catch-22 of Interoperability <p>The Catch-22 of Interoperability is simple: A direct conflict exists between interoperability and innovation–but both are mandatory for web5 to become a breakaway success and achieve its vision of a self-sovereign future.</p><p>Let’s first clarify: by innovation, I’m referring to a particular technology’s search for “product/market fit” which involves iterating until it solves a unique problem well. By interoperability, I’m referring to the near-universal acceptance of websites, regardless of browser; email, regardless of which client sent it; bluetooth, regardless of headphone manufacturer; or Visa cards, regardless of merchant. (Juxtapose these examples with the silos and inconveniences resulting from the lack of messaging interoperability–a fate nobody wants identity to conclude with–where iMessage can’t communicate with What’sApp or Signal or Line or Telegram or dozens of&nbsp;others.)</p><p>To understand why a conflict exists between interoperability and innovation, it’s helpful to understand that the core tenants of web5 (verifiable credentials, decentralized identifiers, and personal data stores) each have numerous incompatible variants competing* for adoption:</p>  verifiable credentials: AnonCreds, W3C VCs, SD-JWT, ACDC, ISO 18013–5,&nbsp;etc.  decentralized identifiers: 100+ DID methods, KERI/ADIs, DNS/x.509-based, etc.  personal data stores: ID wallets, DWNs, Solid Pods, crypto wallet + decentralized storage,&nbsp;etc.  interaction protocols: DIDComm, CHAPI, OIDC4VC, WACI-PeX, CESR, DWN routing,&nbsp;etc.  <p>Theoretically, if the teams working on these divergent approaches agreed to converge on a single standard, we’d quickly reach a critical mass sufficient to realize the value of interoperability. I’ve seen people campaign for such an outcome — but prematurely standardizing is a dangerous prospect for a new technology. Standards move at a snail’s pace, and new technologies need to quickly evolve until a “product/market fit” is reached. Standardizing before adoption puts the cart before the&nbsp;horse.</p><p>On the other hand, unfettered innovation leads to divergence. The free market will adopt technologies based on their merits — and better technical innovations will lead to better products that lead to more adoption. For example, despite several existing options for using selective disclosure in verifiable credentials, <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-01.html">SD-JWT</a> has been introduced as an alternative innovating on simplicity and ability to integrate with existing JWT-based authentication systems. But despite divergence being a healthy part of new technologies finding “product/market fit,” its downsides are obvious: confusion in the market, duplication of efforts, and delaying the benefits of interoperability.</p><p>Thus full interoperability leads to minimal innovation, and full innovation leads to no interoperability. So what is the solution? The solution is to strike a balance between these two&nbsp;demands.</p>Adoption will come from the intersection of these competing forces. The key is to strike a&nbsp;balance. Four Approaches to Balance Interoperability and Innovation <p>We’ve established that innovation and interoperability are both necessary, but in opposition to one another. So where does that leave us? As a relative newbie in the identity space (going on 5 years) I’ve seen 4 approaches taken to balance the trade-offs of innovation and interoperability. I don’t intend to make a value judgment on any of these–each approach has its pros and&nbsp;cons.</p>  The innovate-by-committee: In this model, interoperability is consistently maintained by suggesting new features &amp; improvements in a committee of other companies, likely in a working group, community group, or through an RFC process. While great for interoperability, it’s tragic for innovation. It’s infeasible to expect even the most brilliant people to be able to effectively build the “right” thing sitting in a boardroom. Does Feature A need to support Capability X? A Zoom-call debate with like-minded individuals is no match for customer evidence. The only way to truly innovate is to iterate, with real-world usage, which requires&nbsp;speed.  The fit-and-start: In this model, interoperability is achieved periodically while minimizing the need to slow innovation. Implementers race forward with innovation and contribute the things that are working well back into the community. Usually vendors need to support older (interoperable) versions and newer (more innovative) versions of their products, which is a costly trade-off of this model. Success with this model is challenging in practice — the interoperability devil is in the details which can confuse the&nbsp;market.  The interop-as-feature: This is where interoperability is viewed as a means to unlocking product value as opposed to an end in and of itself. In this model products are usually not interoperable until a specific reason arises, like a partnership or customer demand. Other times, products are built using interoperable standards because those standards unlock features out of the box — but not because of interoperability itself.  The “de-facto” maximalism: This approach cares only about innovation, believing that the best mousetrap will become the de-facto standard that the marketplace adopts regardless of most other factors. While great for innovation, there is a graveyard of failed identity companies who’ve attempted this strategy. Builders&nbsp;beware.   Web5 has a Bright and Interoperable Future <p>The Catch-22 of Interoperability is surely an obstacle to widespread adoption of web5 — but I believe it’s surmountable. I hope that by getting more specific and nuanced in our discussion of interoperability, we’ll better navigate the trade-offs and requirements we all&nbsp;face.</p><p>I have a short list of suggestions that I believe will help the community press forward on this complex&nbsp;topic.</p>  Above all, focus on building products people love. I can’t stress enough that the most elegant, interoperable technology on earth will be meaningless without end-user adoption. People adopt products, not technologies. Luckily, we’re seeing IDtech companies launch faster than ever before thanks to&nbsp;web5.  Brand loyalty for standards is silly. Different requirements matter for different use cases. Rational implementers should evaluate technical decisions based on business requirements. But instead, I consistently see people so intoxicated with JSON-LD or Aries or KERI or &lt;insert flavor of the month&gt; that their rhetoric borders on religious fervor. Force-fitting round pegs into square holes is no way to accomplish goal #1 of building great products.  Interop-shaming is short-sighted. I hope I’ve made it clear in this post that interoperability and innovation both matter. Teams delaying interoperability are simply making a different set of trade-offs compared to teams obsessively maintaining interoperability. The market will decide which approach is rewarded. Despite my cautioning builders to beware “de-facto” maximalism, we need a marketplace full of various approaches to maximize our odds of adoption.  Interoperability for demo’s sake can be a good use of time. Despite pockets of compatibility in some ecosystems, little-to-no real-world interoperability has been realized (let me know if I’ve missed something!). That said, demos of interoperability have driven more developers, interest, and investment into the space. Sometimes the best way to visualize the future is to see it in the form of working code — as long as it doesn’t detract too much from point #1 😊.

It’d be possible to package a verifiable credential proof inside a mDL container, or serializing DIDComm messages using CESR, for example. But for all practical intents and purposes, these variants are each substitutes for one&nbsp;another.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/trinsic/the-catch-22-of-interoperability-fea4dc5ef582">The Catch-22 of Interoperability</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/trinsic">Trinsic</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>I’ve been discussing Mastodon UX wishlists with some new acquaintances there. This excerpt from <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2022/12/17/a-bloomberg-terminal-for-mastodon/">A Bloomberg terminal for Mastodon</a> concludes with part of my own wishlist.</p>
<blockquote><p>
In a Mastodon timeline, a chatty person can dominate what you see at a glance. When we participate in social media we are always making bids for one another’s attention. As publishers of feeds it’s wise to consider how a flurry of items can overwhelm a reader’s experience. But it’s also useful to consider ways that feed readers can filter a chatty source. Steampipe’s SQL foundation affords an easy and natural way to do that. Here’s part of the <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-mastodon-insights/blob/main/query.sp#L391">query</a> that drives the list view.</p>
 select distinct on (list, person, hour) -- only one per list/user/hour
  person,
  url,
  hour,
  toot
from
  data
order by
  hour desc, list, person
 
<p>It was easy to implement a rule that limits each person to at most one toot per hour. Next steps here will be to apply this rule to other views, show the number of collapsed toots, and enable such rules on a per-person basis.
</p></blockquote>
<p>As a warmup exercise, I decided to first add a simple control for boosts that enables me to see my home timeline with or without boosts. To give technically-inclined readers a sense of what’s involved in doing this kind of thing with Steampipe, I’ll describe the changes here. I’m obviously biased but I find this programming environment to be accessible and productive. If it seems that way to you as well, you might want to try out some of the items on your own UX wishlist. And if you do, let me know how it goes!</p>
<p>Here are the original versions of the two files that I changed to add the new feature. First there’s home.sp which defines the dashboard for the home timeline.</p>
 dashboard "Home" {
  
  tags = {
    service = "Mastodon"
  }

  container {
    // a text widget with the HTML links that define the menu of dashboards
  }

  container {
    text {
    // a block that displays the HTML links that form a menu of dashboards
    }

    card {
    // a block that reports the name of my server
    }

    input "limit" {
      width = 2
      title = "limit"
      sql = &lt;&lt;EOQ
        with limits(label) as (
          values 
            ( '50' ),
            ( '100' ),
            ( '200' ),
            ( '500' )
        )
        select
          label,
          label::int as value
        from 
          limits
      EOQ
    }    
  }


  container { 

    table {
      title = "home: recent toots"
      query = query.timeline
      args = [ "home", self.input.limit ]
      column "person" {
        wrap = "all"
      }
      column "toot" {
        wrap = "all"
      }
      column "url" {
        wrap = "all"
      }
    }
  }

}
 
<p>And here’s the new version. It adds an input block called boosts, and passes its value to the referenced query.</p>
 dashboard "Home" {
  
  tags = {
    service = "Mastodon"
  }

  container {
    // a text widget with the HTML links that define the menu of dashboards
  }

  container {
    text {
    // a block that displays the HTML links that form a menu of dashboards
    }

    card {
    // a block that reports the name of my server
    }

    input "limit" {
    // as above
    }

    input "boosts" {
      width = 2
      title = "boosts"
      sql = &lt;&lt;EOQ
        with boosts(label, value) as (
          values
            ( 'include', 'include' ),
            ( 'hide', ' ' ),
            ( 'only', ' 🢁 ' )
        )
        select
          label,
          value
        from
          boosts
      EOQ
    }

  }

  container { 

    table {
      // as above
      args = [ "home", self.input.limit, self.input.boosts ]
    }
  }

}
 
<p>Steampipe dashboards are built with two languages. HCL (Hashicorp configuration language) defines the UX widgets, and SQL fills them with data. In this case we’re selecting static values for the boosts input. But any Steampipe query can run there! For example, here is the input block I use on the dashboard that filters the timeline by the list to which I’ve assigned people.</p>
 input "list" {
  type = "select"
  width = 2
  title = "search home timeline"
  sql = &lt;&lt;EOQ
    select
      title as label,
      title as value
    from
      mastodon_list
    order by
      title
  EOQ
}
 
<p>Now here is the referenced query, query.timeline, from the file query.sp which contains queries used by all the dashboards.</p>
 query "timeline" {
  sql = &lt;&lt;EOQ
    with toots as (
      select
        account_url as account,
        case 
          when display_name = '' then user_name 
          else display_name
        end as person,
        case
          when reblog -&gt; 'url' is null then
            content
          else
            reblog_content
        end as toot,
        to_char(created_at, 'MM-DD HH24:MI') as created_at,
        case
          when reblog -&gt; 'url' is not null then '🢁'
          else ''
        end as boosted,
        case
          when in_reply_to_account_id is not null then ' 🢂 ' || ( select acct from mastodon_account where id = in_reply_to_account_id )
          else ''
        end as in_reply_to,
        case
          when reblog -&gt; 'url' is not null then reblog -&gt;&gt; 'url'
          else url
        end as url
      from
        mastodon_toot
      where
        timeline = $1
      limit $2
    )
    select
      account,
      person || 
        case 
          when in_reply_to is null then ''
          else in_reply_to
        end as person,
      boosted || ' ' || toot as toot,
      url
    from
      toots
    order by
      created_at desc
  EOQ
  param "timeline" {}
  param "limit" {}
}
 
<p>And here is the new version of that query.</p>
 query "timeline" {
  sql = &lt;&lt;EOQ
    with toots as (
    // as above      
    ),
    boosted as (
      select
        $3 as boost,
        boosted,
        account,
        in_reply_to,
        person,
        toot,
        url
      from
        toots
      order by
        created_at desc
    )
    select
      account,
      person ||
        case
          when in_reply_to is null then ''
          else in_reply_to
        end as person,
      boosted || ' ' || toot as toot,
      url
    from
      boosted
    where
      boost = boosted
      or boost = 'include'
      or boost = 'n/a'
  EOQ
  param "timeline" {}
  param "limit" {}
  param "boost" {}
}
 
<p>The original version uses a single CTE (aka common table expression aka WITH clause), toots, to marshall data for the concluding SELECT. The new version inserts another CTE, boosts, into the pipeline. It uses $3 to reference param "boost" {} which maps to the self.input.boosts passed from home.sp</p>
<p>The SQL code is all standard. Postgres is the engine inside Steampipe, and I sometimes use Postgres-specific idioms, but I don’t think any of those are happening here. </p>
<p>The HCL code may be unfamiliar. Steampipe uses HCL because its core audience are DevSecOps pros who are familiar with Terraform, which is HCL-based. But its a pretty simple language that can be used to describe all kinds of resources. Here the resources are widgets that appear on dashboards.</p>
<p>The other thing to know, if you want to roll up your sleeves and try building your own dashboards, is that the developer experience is — again in my biased opinion! — pretty great because if you’re using an autosaving editor you’ll see your changes (to both HCL and SQL code) reflected in realtime. </p>
<p>To illustrate that, here’s the screencast we included in our <a href="https://steampipe.io/blog/dashboards-as-code">blog post</a> introducing the dashboard system.</p>
  
<p>Not shown there, because we wanted to focus on the happy path, is realtime feedback when your SQL queries provoke Postgres errors. The experience feels very much like the one Bret Victor champions in <a href="https://vimeo.com/38272912">Inventing on Principle</a>. The core principle: “Creators need an immediate connection to what they’re creating.” </p>
<p>Here’s the wrong way that too often constrains us.</p>
<blockquote><p>
If there’s anything wrong with the scene, or if I go and make changes, or if I have further ideas, I have to go back to the code, and I edit the code, compile and run, see what it looks like. Anything wrong, I go back to the code. Most of my time is spent working in the code, working in a text editor blindly, without an immediate connection to this thing, which is what I’m actually trying to make.
</p></blockquote>
<p>And here is the right way.</p>
<blockquote><p>
I’ve got this picture on the side, and the code on the side, and this part draws the sky and this draws the mountains and this draws the tree, and when I make any change to the code, the picture changes immediately. So the code and the picture are always in sync; there is no compile and run. I just change things in the code and I see things change in the picture.
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/inventing-on-principle.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>We want to work the right way wherever we can. The experience isn’t available everywhere, yet, but it is available in Steampipe where it powerfully enables the experimentation and prototyping that many of us are inspired to do as we delve into Mastodon. </p>
<p>If you want to try this for yourself, please check out the setup instructions for the <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-mastodon">plugin</a> that maps Mastodon APIs to Postgres tables, and the <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-mastodon-insights">dashboards</a> that use those tables, and ping me (on <a href="https://mastodon.social/@judell">Mastodon</a> if you like!) with any questions you may have.</p>

<p>As I mentioned <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2022/12/10/browsing-the-fediverse/">last time</a>, the Steampipe dashboard for Mastodon has evolved in unexpected ways. I imagined that the components — a <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-mastodon%22">plugin</a> that maps Mastodon APIs to Postgres foreign tables, and a <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-mastodon-insights">suite of views</a> that query the APIs — would combine to enable a broad overview of activity in the Fediverse. That didn’t pan out for two reasons. </p>
<p>First, I learned that the Mastodon community didn’t appreciate the kind of surveillance required for such analysis. That was the original community, I should stress, and things have changed dramatically, but I want to respect the original ethos. Plenty of people will, nevertheless, crawl and index the Fediverse, but I don’t need to put my shoulder to that wheel. And if I did I’d be pushing Steampipe out of its sweet spot: realtime acquisition, querying, and visualization of API-sourced data. </p>
<p>Second, Mastodon’s API allows 300 requests every 5 minutes. You can use Steampipe in batch mode to defeat that limit, and you can store data permanently in its Postgres database, but that cuts across the grain with respect to both Steampipe and Mastodon. All Mastodon clients are subject to the same API rate limit. If you use the web app, or one of the phone apps, you will likely never have seen a message announcing that you’ve hit the limit and need to wait a few minutes. I never saw that message until I started querying the API with Steampipe while also using the web app. </p>
<p>So if Mastodon culture and tech resist deep data mining, and the system is optimized for clients that live within an API budget of 300 requests every 5 minutes, what kind of Mastodon client could Steampipe enable? It wouldn’t be a conventional client because Steampipe is a read-only system. The path forward would be some kind of reader, or browser, that augments the interactive apps. </p>
<p>The outcome, so far, is a suite of dashboards that display tabular views (along with some charts) of the home, local, and federated timelines, of my toot history and my favorites, of my follows and followers, of my notifications, of searches for terms, people, and hashtags, and of the timelines formed by the lists to which I’ve assigned people I follow. These are all HTML tables rendered by Steampipe’s dashboard server. The columns are all sortable, and the cells of the tables can contain only links or plain text. </p>
<p>Given that the toot content returned from the Mastodon API is HTML, the plain-text-only constraint felt, initially, like a blocker. No images? No links in toot content? What good is that?</p>
<p>Some constraints are worth embracing, though, and that may prove true here. The views created this way put a lot of information onto the screen. Here’s my default view in the stock client.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.net/images/default-mastodon-view.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>At a glance I can see three items on the home timeline, and if I want to scroll through 100 items I can only do so awkwardly in small gulps.</p>
<p>Here’s my home timeline in the Steampipe dashboard. I can see a dozen items at a glance, and can easily scan 100 items in gulps of that size.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.net/images/steampipe-mastodon-view.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>When I described this effect to <a href="https://third-bit.com">Greg Wilson</a> he gave me the title for this post: “That sounds like the Bloomberg terminal for Mastodon.” I’ve never used one, and I’m aware that its design is often derided as a UX disaster, but as I understand it the product is built to enable traders to scan fast-moving data feeds from many different sources. In that sense I do think it’s an interesting and useful comparison.</p>
<p>The underlying principle is one I’ve learned from Edward Tufte: present information at maximum density. Our brains are built to take in a lot of information at a glance, and if it’s organized well we can do that very effectively. It feels like that’s happening for me when I scan these densely-packed views of Mastodon activity.</p>
<p>To enhance the effect, I’ve begun to apply filters. In a Mastodon timeline, for example, a chatty person can dominate what you see at a glance. When we participate in social media we are always making bids for one another’s attention. As publishers of feeds it’s wise to consider how a flurry of items can overwhelm a reader’s experience. But it’s also useful to consider ways that feed readers can filter a chatty source. Steampipe’s SQL foundation affords an easy and natural way to do that. Here’s part of the <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-mastodon-insights/blob/main/query.sp#L391">query</a> that drives the list view.</p>
 select distinct on (list, user_name, person, hour) -- only one per list/user/hour
  person,
  url,
  hour,
  toot
from
  data
order by
  hour desc, list, person
 
<p>It was easy to implement a rule that limits each person to at most one toot per hour. Next steps here will be to apply this rule to other views, show the number of collapsed toots, and enable such rules on a per-person basis.</p>
<p>There are always links into the Mastodon web app, and I follow them when I want to view images, boost someone, or reply to someone. The dashboards help me scan a lot of Mastodon activity quickly, and decide which items I want to interact with. Your 500-character toot is all you’ve got to grab my attention, and I’ll only see it as an unformatted chunk of plain text. That’s a pretty severe constraint, and not everyone will want to embrace it, but it’s working pretty well for me so far.</p>
<p>I expect that our dashboard system will support formatted text and images in cells of HTML tables. When it does I’d like to make it an option you can turn on or off in Mastodon dashboards. What should the default be? I suspect I’ll want plain text and no images, especially if image captions can appear along with the text of toots. Some of the original Mastodon cultural norms aren’t surviving the onslaught of new people, but writing descriptions of images is one that’s held up so far, and it’s a wonderful thing. So write a short thoughtful post, write a caption for your image if you include one, and if you capture my attention I’ll click through to view and interact. </p>

  Summary: This post is adapted from my forthcoming book, Learning Digital Identity, from O'Reilly Media. Our physical wallets are, historically, for holding currency. But that may be the least interesting use case for wallets. Many of the things people put in their wallets represent relationships they have and authorizations they hold. Most people don't often leave home without their wallet.

<p>Summary: This post is adapted from my forthcoming book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1098117697/windleyofente-20">Learning Digital Identity</a>, from O'Reilly Media.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c6346a4-4290-4431-ba1c-55622cf636a7_200x262.jpeg">    </a> <p>Our physical wallets are, historically, for holding currency. But that may be the least interesting use case for wallets. Many of the things people put in their wallets represent relationships they have and authorizations they hold. Most people don't often leave home without their wallet.</p><p>But the analogy to a physical wallet can only take us so far, because as physical beings, our natural capabilities are multitude. In the digital world, we need tools to accomplish almost anything useful. The name wallet1 for the software we use to interact digitally doesn't do the tool justice.</p><p>A digital identity wallet is a secure, encrypted database that collects and holds keys, identifiers, and verifiable credentials (VCs). The wallet is also a digital address book, collecting and maintaining its controller's many relationships. The wallet is coupled with a software agent that speaks the protocols necessary to engage with others.</p><p>Wallets and agents are not the same thing, even though they're often conflated. Agents are tools for taking action. Wallets are where stuff is stored. Still, most people just say "wallet," even when they mean "wallet and agent." For this post, when I say "wallet" I mean wallet and when I say "agent" I mean agent.</p><p>Identity agents are software services that manage all the stuff in the wallet. Agents store, update, retrieve, and delete all the artifacts that a wallet holds. Beyond managing the wallet, agents perform many other important tasks:</p>  <p>Sending and receiving messages with other agents</p>  <p>Requesting that the wallet generate cryptographic key pairs</p>  <p>Managing encrypted data interactions with the wallet</p>  <p>Performing cryptographic functions like signing and verifying signatures</p>  <p>Backing up and retrieving data in the wallet</p>  <p>Maintaining relationships by communicating with other agents when DID documents are updated</p>  <p>Routing messages to other agents</p>   <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F36a84897-c580-4e72-960a-4964a64c5def_555x251.png">    </a>The relationship between identity wallets and agents  <p>This figure shows the relationship between an agent, a wallet, and the underlying operating system. While most current implementations pair a single agent with a single wallet, the presence of an API means that it's possible for one agent to use several wallets, or for multiple agents to access one wallet. Some specialized agents might not even need a wallet, such as those that just perform routing, although most will at least need to store their own keys.</p><p>The key-management functions in the wallet includes actions on cryptographic keys like generation, storage, rotation, and deletion. Key management is performed in cooperation with the operating system and underlying hardware. Ideally, the operating system and hardware provide a secure enclave for key storage and a trusted execution environment for performing key-management functions.</p><p>The basic functions shown in the diagram might not seem to have much to do with identity. Identity-related activities like authentication and credential exchange are built on top of these basic functions. The agent can issue, request, and accept VCs. The agent also presents and verifies credentials. Specialized messages perform these activities.</p> Agents and Credential Exchange <p>Agents speak a protocol called DIDComm (DID-based communication) that provides a secure communications layer for the exchange of identity information via verifiable credentials (VCs). Agents speak DIDComm to each other without a third-party intermediary (i.e., they're peer-to-peer). Because of DIDComm's flexibility and the ability to define protocols on top of DIDComm messaging, it promises to be as important as the identity layer it enables. The DIDComm protocol is governed by the <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm specification</a>, hosted at the <a href="https://identity.foundation">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>. The current ratified version is 2.0.</p><p>The specification's opening sentence states that "the purpose of DIDComm Messaging is to provide a secure, private communication methodology built atop the decentralized design of DIDs." Note that the specification describes DIDComm as a communications methodology. This means that DIDComm is more than just a way to send a message or chat with someone else. DIDComm messaging allows individual messages to be composed into application-level protocols and workflows. This makes DIDComm messaging a foundational technology for performing different kinds of interactions within the framework of trust that a DID-based relationship implies.</p><p>To enable the exchange of verifiable credentials, the agent, using the wallet as secure storage, performs three primary activities:</p>  <p>Exchanging DIDs with other agents</p>  <p>Requesting and issuing credentials</p>  <p>Requesting and presenting credential proofs</p>  <p>The agent does these activities using protocols that run on top of DIDComm. DIDComm's job is to create a secure, mutually authenticated channel for exchanging DIDComm messages. The protocols that operate inside of it, carry out specific activities.</p> Exchanging DIDs <p>Agents take care of the tedious and tricky job of exchanging DIDs between parties who want to communicate so that people don't have to get entangled in the details of how DIDs work: how they're created, stored, and validated. Or the work that's necessary when one of the parties needs to rotate keys. The <a href="https://didcomm.org/book/v2/whatsnew">DIDComm v2 spec is capable of exchanging DIDs</a> without a separate protocol so the process can be automated by smart identity agents working on behalf of the various parties.</p> Requesting and Issuing Credentials <p>Requesting and issuing credentials is defined in <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/features/0036-issue-credential/README.md">Aries RFC 0036: Issue Credential Protocol 1.0</a>. The protocol "formalizes messages used to issue a credential." The protocol describes four primary messages: <code>propose-credential</code>, <code>offer-credential</code>, <code>request-credential</code>, and <code>issue-credential</code>. The protocol also defines the state machine that the agent operates in response to these messages. These messages combined with the state machine allow the credential issuer and the credential holder to engage is the ceremonies necessary for the issuer to issue a credential to the holder.</p> Requesting and Presenting Credential Proofs <p>Requesting and presenting credential proofs is defined in <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/features/0037-present-proof/README.md">Aries RFC 0037: Present Proof Protocol 1.0</a>. The protocol formalizes and generalizes message formats used for presenting a proof of the attributes in a credential. The protocol describes three primary messages: <code>propose-proof</code>, <code>request-proof</code>, and <code>present-proof</code>. The protocol also defines the state machine that the agent operates in response to these messages. These messages and state machine allow the credential holder and the credential verifier to engage in the ceremonies necessary for the holder to present a credential proof to the verifier.</p> The Nature of Wallets and Agents <p>Agents and wallets, working together, perform the work necessary for people, businesses, and devices to create mutually-authenticated, secure connections and use those connections to exchange verifiable credentials. People, businesses, and devices all have different needs and so they'll use different agents and wallets.</p>  <p>People will generally use agents and wallets running on smart phones, laptops, or other personal devices. Your Amazon Alexa, for example could have an agent/wallet pair installed on it to act on your behalf. Most people will have agents on every device. Most of these will have wallets associated with them. Wallets will use device secure enclaves to store sensitive cryptographic information. People will also have agents and wallets in the cloud. All of the agents and wallets under a person's control will interoperate with each other and perform different roles. For example, cloud-based agents are needed to route DIDComm messages to devices that may not have a routable IP address.</p>  <p>Businesses will use enterprise agents that are integrated with other enterprise systems like CRM, ERP, and IAM systems. The wallets associated with these will be more sophisticated than personal wallets since they have to manage DIDs and their associated keys that various employees, departments, and processes use. The ability to delegate authority and permission actions will be more rigorous than is needed in a personal wallet. A large business might operate thousands of enterprise agents for various business purposes.</p>  <p>Devices will use agents with associated wallets to create relationships and perform credential exchange with the device owner, other devices, their manufacturer, and other people or companies. How they operate and their sophistication depend in great measure on the nature of the device and its expected function. I wrote about the reasons for using agents as part of IoT devices in <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/12/the_self-sovereign_internet_of_things.shtml">The Self-Sovereign Internet of Things</a>.</p>  <p>Despite differences that these agents exhibit, they all run the same protocols and use DIDComm messaging. There are no intermediaries—the connections are all peer-to-peer. Every agent works on behalf of the entity who controls it. To get a feel for how they might interoperate, see <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/11/operationalizing_digital_relationships.shtml">Operationalizing Digital Relationships</a> and <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/06/ssi_interaction_patterns.shtml">SSI Interaction Patterns</a>.</p><p>DIDComm-capable agents can be used to create sophisticated relationship networks that include people, institutions, and things. The relationships in that network are rich and varied—just like relationships in the real world. Smart agents allow people, business and devices to create, manage, and utilize secure, trustworthy communications channels with anyone online without reliance on any third party. The agent serves as flexible digital tool that people can use to manage their digital life.</p>    Notes   <p>I've heard various people object to the term wallet, but so far, no one has come up with anything else that has stuck, so for now, wallet is the word the industry uses.</p>  <p>Tags: <a href="https://www.windley.com/tags/ssi">ssi</a> <a href="https://www.windley.com/tags/identity">identity</a> <a href="https://www.windley.com/tags/wallets">wallets</a> <a href="https://www.windley.com/tags/agents">agents</a> <a href="https://www.windley.com/tags/verifiable+credentials">verifiable+credentials</a> <a href="https://www.windley.com/tags/didcomm">didcomm</a></p>

<p>Thursday, October 27, 2022</p>



<p>With the other members of our group having already departed, we joined our friends Liz and Peter to explore a few more places in Montgomery. We started our day at the <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/civil-rights-memorial">Civil Rights Memorial Center</a>, part of the Southern Poverty Law Center headquarters. The Memorial Center wasn’t large, but had some excellent multimedia presentations on the civil rights struggle, both historical and ongoing.</p>



<p>From there we walked over to the former Greyhound bus station associated with the Freedom Riders. The station is now a small museum, the <a href="https://ahc.alabama.gov/properties/freedomrides/freedomrides.aspx">Freedom Rides Museum</a>, and has signs on the outside with a detailed history. While there, a Black woman drove up to take some <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CkQZACWPxyt/">video</a> of the bus station and we had a somewhat surprising conversation with her. She was not entirely pleased with the placement of all of the civil rights museums and displays in Montgomery — she thought that the Black community needed to strengthen themselves and didn’t need to be constantly reminded of their struggles.</p>


 
<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/img_8915.jpg"></a>Freedom Rides Museum 


<p>From there we walked to the <a href="https://www.troy.edu/student-life-resources/arts-culture/rosa-parks-museum/index.html">Rosa Parks Museum</a> a few blocks away. The museum tour consisted of a couple of multimedia presentations describing the background and events of the day she refused to give up her seat on a city bus, which gave us a much more detailed understanding of the events of that day and the questionable legality of her arrest. This was followed by a short self-guided tour of artifacts relating to the tension between the Black community and the police.</p>



<p>It was then about time to make our way to the airport for our flights home. We returned to our hotel to retrieve our bags and got a Lyft ride to the airport. The Montgomery Regional Airport is a fairly small airport consisting of about five gates located only about 15 minutes from downtown. TSA inspection was quick and we had a small lunch in the airport’s one restaurant. Co-located with the airport is an Alabama Air National Guard base, which surprised us as several pairs of fighter planes — F-16s I think — took off with considerable noise and speed.</p>

<p>Wednesday, October 26, 2022</p>



<p>Today was the last day of the official tour (we are staying a day longer) and a very powerful day. After breakfast at the hotel, we went to the <a href="https://museumandmemorial.eji.org/museum">Legacy Museum</a>, a large and modern museum established by the <a href="https://eji.org/">Equal Justice Initiative</a> to tell the story of Black experience from enslavement to mass incarceration (the current situation). The museum proceeded roughly chronologically from the slave trade, slavery, the Civil War, reconstruction, Jim Crow segregation, and lynchings, to the current disproportionate sentencing and incarceration of Black people. The images and words used in the museum were very strong and intentionally uncomfortable for many. We were somewhat prepared by our recent experience, but the story was very uncomfortable nonetheless.</p>



<p>Following the museum, we traveled to another of Equal Justice Initiative’s projects, the <a href="https://museumandmemorial.eji.org/memorial">National Memorial for Peace and Justice</a>. The memorial, which is outdoors, includes hundreds of large corroded iron rectangular blocks that, by county, list the names and dates of lynching victims up to 1950. There was also a section to recognize counties and states that had put up markers recognizing the deaths of these victims. I was struck by the number of markers and names of people who had been lynched; this presentation of the names helps one appreciate the magnitude of the lynching problem.</p>

<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/img_8904.jpg"></a>Sculptures at Michelle Browder’s studio




<p>We then traveled to the <a href="https://www.anarchalucybetsey.org/">studio</a> (for lack of a better name) of Michelle Browder, who led us on our tour yesterday, for lunch and discussion. After lunch, Michelle showed us her artwork, which included large sculptures and an old car that had been intricately decorated by use of a plasma cutter on its body. Her artwork and advocacy were recently highlighted in People Magazine.</p>



<p>We then sat down for a final debrief on our memories of the week before the first of our co-travelers had to leave for the airport.</p>



<p>Afterward, our friends Peter and Liz joined us in visiting the <a href="https://www.museum.alabama.gov/">Museum of Alabama</a>, located in the state archives building near the capitol. The museum was well presented, but we were now better equipped to read between the lines of many of the descriptions. For example, commerce often meant slave trade.</p>



<p>After returning to the hotel to clean up, we went to a nearby brewpub, the <a href="https://www.towertaproom.com/">Tower Taproom</a>. It had quite good pub food, and an interesting array of self-service taps that were enabled using a card they issued at the cash register. The taps measured beer (a good selection, plus a few wines and ciders) by the ounce, and you were charged for the amount you poured.</p>

  <p>(Updated Dec 14, 2022 with clarifications and a subscriber implementation note.)</p>
 Preface 
<p>The British government clearly has more tolerance for humor when
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boaty_McBoatface">naming important things</a> than the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/">W3C does</a>. Continuing in the original fashion, thus
this name.</p>
 The Problem 
<p>The publish-subscribe pattern is well known, but in some circumstances, it suffers from
two important problems:</p>
 
 
<p>When a subscriber is temporarily not present, or cannot be reached, sent events
are often lost. This can happen, for example, if the subscriber computer reboots,
falls off the network, goes to sleep, has DNS problems and the like. Once the
subscriber recovers, it is generally not clear what needs to happen for the subscriber
to catch up to the events it may have missed. It is not even clear whether it has missed
any. Similarly, it is unclear for how long the publisher needs to retry to
send a message; it may be that the subscriber has permanently gone away.</p>
 
 
<p>Subscriptions are often set up as part of the following pattern:</p>
 
 A resource on the Web is accessed. For example, a user reads an article on a website,
or a software agent fetches a document. 
 Based on the content of the obtained resource, a decision is made to subscribe to updates
to that resource. For example, the user may decide that they are interested in updates
to the article on the website they just read. 
 There is a time lag between the time the resource has been accessed, and when the
subscription becomes active, creating a race condition during which update events may
be missed. 
 
 
 
<p>While these two problems are not always significant, there are important circumstances
in which they are, and this proposal addresses those circumstances.</p>
 Approach to the solution 
<p>We augment the publish-subscribe pattern in the following way:</p>
 
 
<p>All events, as well as the content of the resource that whose changes are supposed
to be tracked are time-stamped. Also, each event identifies the event that directly
precedes it (that way, the subscriber can detect if it missed something).
Alternatively, a monotonically increasing sequence number could be used.</p>
 
 
<p>The publisher stores the history of events emitted so far. For efficiency reasons,
this may be shortened to some time window reaching to the present,
as appropriate for the application; for example, all events in the last month.
(Similar to how RSS/Atom feeds are commonly implemented.)</p>
 
 
<p>The publisher provides a query interface to the subscriber to that history,
with a “since” time parameter, so the subscriber can obtain the sequence of events
emitted since a certain time. (Actually, since “right after” the provided time not
including the provided time itself.)</p>
 
 
<p>When subscribing, in addition to the callback address, the subscriber provides to
the publisher:</p>
 
 a time stamp, and 
 a subscription id. 
 
 
 
<p>Further, the actual sending of an event from the publisher to the subscriber is
considered to be a performance optimization, rather than core to the functionality.
This means that if the event cannot be successfully conveyed (see requirements above),
it is only an inconvenience and inefficiency rather than a cause of lost data.</p>
 Details 
 About the race condition 
 
 
<p>The future subscriber accesses resource R and finds time stamp T0.
For example, a human reads a web page whose publication date is April 23, 2021, 23:00:00 UTC.</p>
 
 
<p>After some time passes, the subscriber decides to subscribe. It does this with the
well-known subscription pattern, but in addition to providing a callback address, it
also provides time stamp T0 and a unique (can be random) subscription id.
For example, a human’s hypothetical news syndication app may provide an event update
endpoint to the news website, and time T0.</p>
 
 
<p>The publisher sets up the subscription, and immediately checks whether any events
should have been sent between (after) T0 and the present. (It can do that because it stores
the update history.) If so, it emits those events to
the subscriber, in sequence, before continuing with regular operations. As a result,
there is no more race condition between subscription and event.</p>
 
 
<p>When sending an event, the publisher also sends the subscription id.</p>
 
 
 About temporary unavailability of the subscriber 
 
 
<p>After a subscription is active, assume the subscriber disappears and new events cannot be
delivered. The publisher may continue to attempt to deliver events for as long as
it likes, or stop immediately.</p>
 
 
<p>When the subscriber re-appears, it finds the time of the last event it had received
from the publisher, say time T5. It queries the event history published by the publisher
with parameter T5 to find out what events it missed. It processes those events and
then re-subscribes with a later starting time stamp corresponding to the last
event it received (say T10). When it re-subscribes, it uses a different subscription id
and cancels the old subscription.</p>
 
 
<p>After the subscriber has re-appeared, it ignores/rejects all incoming events with
the old subscription id.</p>
 
 
 Subscriber implementation notes 
 
 
<p>The subscriber receives events exclusively through a single queue for incoming events.
This makes implementing an incoming-event handler very simple, as it can simply
process events in order.</p>
 
 
<p>The event queue maintains the timestamp of the last event it successfully added.
When a new event arrives, the queue accepts this event but only if the new event
is the direct follower of the last event it successfully added. If it is not, the
incoming event is discarded. (This covers both repeatedly received events and
when some events were missed.)</p>
 
 
<p>The subscriber also maintains a timer with a countdown from the last time an event
was successfully added to the incoming queue. (The time constant of the timer is
application-specific, and may be adaptive.) When the timeout occurs, the subscriber
queries the publisher, providing the last successful timestamp.
If no updates are being found, nothing happens. If updates are being found, it
is fair to consider the existing subscription to have failed. Then:</p>
 
 The subscriber itself inserts the obtained “missed” events into its own incoming
event queue from where they are processed. 
 The subscriber cancels the existing subscription. 
 The subscriber creates a new subscription, with the timestamp of the most recent
successfully-inserted event. 
 
 
 
 Observations 
 
 
<p>Publishers do not need to remember subscriber-specific state. (Thanks,
<a href="https://kafka.apache.org/">Kafka</a>, for showing us!) That makes it easy to implement
the publisher side.</p>
 
 
<p>From the perspective of the publisher, delivery of events to subscribers that can receive
callbacks, and those that need to poll, both works. (It sort of emulates RSS except that
a starting time parameter is provided by the client, instead of a uniform window
decided on by the publisher as in RSS)</p>
 
 
<p>Subscribers only need to keep a time stamp as state, something they probably have already
anyway.</p>
 
 
<p>Subscribers can implement a polling or push strategy, or dynamically change between those,
without the risk of losing data.</p>
 
 
<p>Publishers are not required to push out events at all. If they don’t, this protocol
basically falls back to polling. This is inefficient but much better than the alternative
and can also be used in places where, for example, firewalls prevent event pushing.</p>

<p>Would love your thoughts!</p>

<p>Tuesday, October 25, 2022</p>



<p>After getting up and packing for today’s trip to Montgomery, we loaded up the bus and made the very short trip to the <a href="https://www.selmacenterfornonviolence.org">Selma Center for Nonviolence, Truth, and Reconciliation</a> (SCNTR). We had breakfast at the Center, followed by training, focusing on the meaning and application of nonviolence, from the Center’s director, Ainka Jackson. One of the major themes was the difference between nonviolence, which is an active role, from the passive role of non-violence (or avoidance of violence).</p>



<p>Lunch was also at SCNTR and featured a powerful presentation from Callie Greer on nonviolence and forgiveness. Many years ago, her son was shot and killed in an argument with one of his peers. When the perpetrator was put on trial, she asked in her victim statement that he not be sentenced to death or to life in prison, but rather be given a minimum sentence. The judge, stunned, complied. She met the perpetrator after he had served his prison time and asked for his mother to contact her. Callie and the perpetrator’s mother continue talking to this day.</p>



<p>Another situation that Callie related was that her daughter found a breast lump. Due to the lack of appropriate healthcare, her cancer was not diagnosed until it had progressed too far and the daughter died. She is finding it difficult to forgive the healthcare system (specifically, the lack of Medicaid in Alabama) for this.</p>

<p>After the lunch discussion, we rode the bus across the Pettus bridge and on to Montgomery, Alabama. Downtown Montgomery is a considerably more attractive capital than downtown Jackson, probably due to their focus on attracting conventions and other travelers. When we arrived, we met Michelle Browder, who in addition to being our tour guide is an entrepreneur. She is focused on telling a more complete story about the role of Black women as test subjects in the development of gynecological treatment, and how they were victimized in undergoing this experimentation.</p>



<p>Michelle led us on a tour that began at the waterfront of the Alabama River, and gave us a lesson on reading between the lines of the historical markers in town. She pointed out in particular three markers that highlighted the slave trade and Montgomery’s role in it. There were to be more of these markers, but of course the city stopped the project.</p>



<p>After the tour, we returned to check into the hotel (the Renaissance, probably the nicest hotel in town), and gathered at Central, a nearby restaurant that is also among the best. This was the final group dinner of the trip, because most of the group will be leaving tomorrow afternoon.</p>

<p>Monday, October 24, 2022</p>



<p>After a buffet breakfast at our hotel, we had an hour or so with Mike Espy, former Secretary of Agriculture, Congressman, and Senate candidate. Secretary Espy discussed the political climate in Mississippi in quite some detail, and made it yet more clear that Mississippi politics are more complicated than one might think, and civil rights is not a lost cause.</p>



<p>We then boarded our bus for the three-hour bus ride to Selma, Alabama. Selma today is a somewhat depressed town of about 18,000 having one of the highest murder rates in the state. In the 1960s, Selma was an important site for the civil rights movement. In 1965, attempts were made to march from here to the state capitol in Montgomery to demand voting rights. Initially this Freedom March was blocked by police and resulted in considerable injury to the protesters. Eventually a successful march was held following issuance of a court order.</p>



<p>Upon arrival, we visited the <a href="https://bytherivercenterforhumanity.com">By the River Center for Humanity</a>, a mixed-use community facility. They served us a delicious lunch which was followed by a talk by JoAnne Bland, one of the participants in the Freedom March. She shared with us some of her vision for Selma, and led us in a bit of singing and dancing as well.</p>

<p>We then walked across the famous Edmund Pettus Bridge, and visited the <a href="http://nvrmi.com">National Voting Rights Museum</a> just across the river from Selma. The museum had artifacts and pictures from the Freedom March, as well as considerable material on subsequent visits to Selma by presidents, particularly Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.</p>



<p>After a short break at our hotel (the St. James hotel, recently renovated by Hilton), we took a short walk to The Revolt Selma, a new restaurant opened by a Black entrepreneur, for a buffet-style steak dinner.</p>

<p>Sunday, October 23, 2022</p>



<p>We started earlier than usual today in order to catch the 8 am service at New Horizons Church, a majority-Black church in a former strip mall in southern Jackson. The facility was beautifully adapted to its use as a church, and we were warmly welcomed. Most of the music was presented by a children’s group, which was very talented.</p>



<p>After the service, we met with the Senior Pastor, Bishop Ronnie Crudup. He described the formation of the church and also went into considerable detail about the political climate in Jackson and more generally in Mississippi. One story that struck me was that the Governor, rather than distribute federal aid from the American Recovery Act, sent at least some of the money back to the federal government saying that it was not needed. This struck me as simply cruel. In any case it is organizations like New Horizons that are developing the community for future leadership.</p>



<p>We then went to a local restaurant for brunch with some local women leaders (and teenage leaders) who are working in the area of voting rights and getting the Black community, and Black women in particular, to participate in the political process and specifically to vote.</p>



<p>After brunch we took our bus to the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum in downtown Jackson. The museum is, perhaps surprisingly, funded by the State of Mississippi. We started out with a short talk by Hezekiah Watkins, one of the original Freedom Riders. We then had some time — although not enough — to explore the museum, which took us from the days of slavery to the present, with an emphasis on the mid-20th century civil rights movement.</p>

<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/img_8810.jpg"></a>Mississippi Civil Rights Museum




<p>We then took the bus to the Medgar Evers home. Evers, the field secretary for the Mississippi NAACP, was shot and killed there in 1963. The house has recently been designated as a national monument, but unfortunately wasn’t open for tours when we were there.</p>

<p>A month ago, when the Great Discontinuity happened, I started working on a Steampipe plugin to enable SQL queries against the Mastodon API, along with a companion Steampipe “mod” (suite of dashboards) to display and chart the results of those queries.</p>
<p>I expect these dashboards will soon be available in <a href="https://cloud.steampipe.io">Steampipe Cloud</a>, where it will take just a few seconds to pop in your Mastodon access token (from, e.g., <a href="https://mastodon.social/settings/applications/new">https://mastodon.social/settings/applications/new</a>) and begin using the dashboards.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if you’re so inclined, you can find the plugin <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-mastodon">here</a> and the dashboards <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-mastodon-insights">here</a>. If you’re reasonably technical you can pretty quickly and easily install Steampipe, clone these repos, build the plugin, and start using the dashboards. </p>
<p>Why would you want to? My own motivation, originally, was to do Mastodon analytics. I thought Steampipe’s SQLification of the API would be a handy way to discern and monitor activity trends during a period of extraordinary flux. And that’s proven to be true, to a limited extent. Here’s a <a href="https://cloud.steampipe.io/user/judell/workspace/personal/snapshot/snap_ceadu3fclgsqqchccd7g_11qxtodekrz7416zi0obhxj0l">snapshot</a> of the dashboard that uses the <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/entities/activity/">instance activity</a> API. </p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.net/images/mastodon-instance-activity.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>I’m watching this chart with great interest. Where does it go from here? I’m not going to hazard a guess. Everything’s up in the air right now, and anything could happen.</p>
<p>But as I added tables to the plugin to encapsulate more of the Mastodon API, and added dashboards to visualize those tables, my focus shifted. I began to see the suite of dashboards as a Mastodon reader/browser that complements the web and phone clients, and that’s how I mainly use them now.</p>
<p>I think the key benefit is one of Edward Tufte’s core principles: <a href="https://guypursey.com/blog/202001041530-tufte-principles-visual-display-quantitative-information#data-density-and-small-multiples">information density</a>. Each of these dashboards shows more activity than you can see at a glance in the web or phone interfaces. I find this very helpful for searching and browsing. When I see items of interest that I want to interact with, I click through to the web app in order to boost, reply, or favorite.</p>
<p>Will this way of browsing Mastodon appeal to you? To get a feel for what it’s like, here are <a href="https://steampipe.io/blog/release-0-17-0">snapshots</a> of some of the dashboards I’ve built so far. </p>

<p><a href="https://cloud.steampipe.io/user/judell/workspace/personal/snapshot/snap_ce7orv0sthg9ors2vnrg_2r01hlgv8cu1o2nv6fgtt8hy2">dashboard.Me</a>  </p>
<p><a href="https://cloud.steampipe.io/user/judell/workspace/personal/snapshot/snap_ce7otsosthg9ors2vo0g_23db5k9bk9y1y1z2snuypuemt">dashboard.Notification</a> </p>
<p><a href="https://cloud.steampipe.io/user/judell/workspace/personal/snapshot/snap_ce7ouh0sthg9ors2vo1g_2ql460havk2rj8d3ckvutu0ub">dashboard.PeopleSearch</a> </p>

<p>For me, at least, this approach has become an effective way to browse the fediverse, find interesting people, read what they boost, and keep track of my own activity.</p>
<p>If you are dev-minded, by the way, please note that these dashboards are just one way to skin the results of queries against the plugin. Any SQL client can connect to Steampipe’s Postgres endpoint. You could use dashboards like Metabase or Grafana, or you could embed Steampipe <a href="https://steampipe.io/blog/steampipe-as-component">as a component</a> in an app. </p>

<p>It helps that there&nbsp;are people and regions in the world providing living examples of how that is done. Vinay is deeply familiar with those and will share what he knows in ways that help us co-think and work to save the planet’s butt, along with our own.</p>
<p>The salon is at 2 PM Eastern time. It is also free, but you need to register first, <a href="https://events.iu.edu/ostromworkshop/event/644999-ostrom-workshop-beyond-the-web-salon-series-vinay">here</a>.</p>

<p>Saturday, October 22, 2022</p>



<p>Today we are off to Jackson, Mississippi. We are also changing focus from history (enslavement) to contemporary civil rights issues. After breakfast we had a visit from three community members involved in trying to improve the criminal justice system in Louisiana. First we heard from Will Snowden of the <a href="https://www.vera.org/">Vera Institute</a>. He spoke about their initiative to reduce the population in Orleans Parish jails following Hurricane Katrina from about 7200 to 1000, largely by observing the distinction between jails (typically short-term detainees awaiting trial) and prisons (long-term convicted detainees). This distinction gives long-term detainees the potential to have access to education and training programs to help them develop. Vera Institute is working more broadly to improve equity in the criminal legal system in Louisiana as well.</p>



<p>We then heard from Everett “Buck” Ofray and Louis Gibson, both former long-term detainees who had been convicted of second-degree murder. They described their journey from arrival at Louisiana’s notorious Angola Prison, forced to labor initially without pay and later for only 20 cents an hour. Held without parole, they had to challenge the system to obtain access to education and vocational opportunities.  Eventually they worked their way into more and more responsible jobs like maintaining aircraft for the State Police. Changes in law allowed them to eventually be paroled. They described their process of re-integration into society; both are now working to assist other recent detainees. Louis is also working as a paralegal. This was truly an inspirational talk.</p>



<p>We then loaded into our bus for the three hour drive to Jackson, Mississippi for the next phase of our journey. We stopped along the way for a picnic lunch and to discuss what we have learned so far.</p>



<p>This is also homecoming weekend, a big deal in Jackson, so we expect everything to be crowded. We had dinner this evening at the <a href="https://jackson.charrestaurant.com/">Char Restaurant</a>, again a very enjoyable meal. Tomorrow will be an early and full day, so we are turning in early.</p>

<p>Friday, October 21, 2022</p>



<p>After breakfast at our hotel, we got on the bus and went east to visit one of the bayous. Along the way, we stopped and were introduced to a native American couple who explained the many ways that the oil industry in the area had impacted their lives. In addition to needing to relocate, they were severely affected by the Gulf of Mexico oil well disaster, and continue to endure health threats from toxic emissions from the refineries, many of which have been made legal through lobbying efforts on behalf of the oil companies.</p>



<p>We continued east through St. Bernard Parish, and as we did, we saw many skeletons of dead oak trees. These have apparently died due to increased salination of the underground aquafer. Many homes were seen that were propped up on platforms typically 20 feet above ground. Many of these homes were owned not by locals but by sport fishermen as second homes or as rentals. As we looked out into the waterway, it was fairly obvious which boars belonged the visiting sport fishermen and which were owned by locals. As our hosts explained, the waterway is always in a state of transition. There have been efforts to open new channels from the Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico, and other projects that would change the salinity of that portion of the delta. Nobody seems to be sure how long this will last.</p>



<p>Returning to New Orleans, we had lunch at a very pleasant restaurant, <a href="https://cafecarmo.com/">Carmo</a>. Our next stop was at a youth development organization called <a href="https://sonofasaint.org/">Son of a Saint</a>. Housed in a newly renovated former ice house, Son of a Saint provides mentorship services to boys who have lost their fathers. Engagement with them begins in middle school and extends through their educational career and beyond. They have a very impressive track record with the boys they have mentored.</p>

<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/img_8781.jpg"></a>Portion of StudioBE interior




<p>We then traveled to <a href="https://studiobenola.com/">StudioBE</a>, a warehouse art gallery space featuring the art of “BMike”, a local urban artist. As you might expect, BMike’s preferred medium is spray paint, but the amount of expression and detail he is able to impart is truly impressive. But spray paint is not his only medium: there were exhibits in many forms, even simulated video games. Along with the art were words that were in many cases quite profound. This visit definitely broadened my art tastes.</p>



<p>After a short break at the hotel, the group went to dinner at the <a href="https://windsorcourthotel.com/">Windsor Court Hotel</a>, where we had stayed on our visit to New Orleans about 10 years ago. It was a wonderful dinner, definitely too much food but all of it delicious.</p>

<p>Here are three things I once hoped — but no longer expect — to outlive:</p>
<p>1. PDF files</p>
<p>2. passwords</p>
<p>3. The occasional need to scrape data from web pages</p>
<p>PDF files and passwords are topics for another day, but web scraping is timely. Today I was asked to corral data from the Steampipe blog, and the path of least resistance was (of course!) to extract it from the site. </p>
<p>I was all warmed up for the exercise because we’d just published a <a href="https://steampipe.io/blog/steampipe-is-an-http-client">post</a> dramatically entitled “Why build an HTTP client into a database? So you can ingest web data directly!” In that post I show three solutions enabled by the <a href="https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/net">Net plugin’s</a> <a href="https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/net/tables/net_http_request">net_http_request</a> table. </p>
<p>Since the dawn of the web, scraping has worked this way: Use a script to fetch the data, then save it for retrieval and analysis. You might use the script language to query the data, or the query language of a database. </p>
<p>A couple of years ago I found a way to unify those ingredients: Run the script inside the database. You can do a lot with Postgres’ built-in procedural language, and even more if you activate Python inside Postgres. I went deeply into both and explained why in <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/07/24/pl-pgsql-versus-pl-python-heres-why-im-using-both-to-write-postgres-functions/">an earlier episode</a>.</p>
<p>PL/Python was great for <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/08/19/postgres-set-returning-functions-that-self-memoize-as-materialized-views/">advanced uses</a>, and I used it for a bit of web scraping too. It all worked fine, and I never thought to ask this question: “What if the database is the HTTP client, and SQL the common way to reason over data coming through that pipe?”</p>
<p>The examples in the post show what that’s like. In its simplest form you write a query like this.</p>
 select
    response_status_code,
    jsonb_pretty(response_headers) as headers
  from
    net_http_request
  where
    url = 'https://steampipe.io'
 
<p>The result is like this.</p>
 +----------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| response_status_code | headers                                               |
+----------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| 200                  | {                                                     |
|                      |     "Age": [                                          |
|                      |         "45557"                                       |
|                      |     ],                                                |
|                      |     "Date": [                                         |
|                      |         "Fri, 09 Dec 2022 06:46:40 GMT"               |
|                      |     ],                                                |
|                      |     "Etag": [                                         |
|                      |         "W/\"614a142998557b388e053bfa4408cf70\""      |
 
<p>The response_status_code is a regular Postgres column, the headers column is a JSONB column that you can index into (e.g. headers -&gt;&gt; 'etag'). If you also select the response_body column of the net_http_request table you’ll get another regular Postgres column containing the text of the web page. If it’s HTML text, you can use regular expressions to match patterns in it. If it’s JSON text you can use Postgres’ JSON functions to query and transform it. </p>
<p>You can join fields nested in the JSON with other Postgres columns. And those other columns can belong to tables populated in any of the ways <a href="https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins">Steampipe plugins</a> populate tables: from JSON or GraphQL API endpoints, from CSV or Terraform or Yaml files, from anywhere really. As a developer writing Steampipe queries (and flowing results into dashboards) you see all of these sources as tables, you query them individually in all the ways Postgres can, and you join across diverse sources in a common way. </p>
<p>Of course web pages are structured in ways that regular expressions can’t easily grok. It’s easy to match links, but parsing HTML tag names and attributes is a job for a real parser. I’d made a start on an <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-html">HTML plugin</a> for Steampipe. There were already two tables: one to extract links from a web page, one to transform HTML tables to CSV format. So today, when tasked with tabulating blog metadata, I added a third table to enable these queries.</p>
 -- find the title

select
  page,
  tag_name,
  tag_content
from
  html_tag
where
  page = 'https://steampipe.io/blog/selective-select'
  and tag_name = 'title'

-- list the meta tags

select
  page,
  tag_name,
  tag_attrs
from
  html_tag
where
  page = 'https://steampipe.io/blog/selective-select'
  and tag_name = 'meta'
 
<p>That’s a powerful way to reason over HTML data! It was easy for me to extend the HTML plugin in this way, and I assure you that I’m no 10x programmer. The <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk">Steampipe plugin SDK</a> and the wonderful <a href="https://github.com/PuerkitoBio/goquery">goquery package</a> are doing all the heavy lifting. I just had to stitch the components together, and if you’re any kind of programmer, with or without Go experience, you could pretty readily do the same.</p>

<p>Thursday, October 20, 2022</p>



<p>Our day began with a briefing in a conference room in our hotel. Our leaders spoke for almost two hours on the history of slavery in the US and specifically in New Orleans as background for our visit to <a href="https://www.whitneyplantation.org">Whitney Plantation</a>, about an hour’s bus ride from town. We made it to the plantation about noon, and had a picnic lunch there.</p>



<p>Whitney Plantation is different from most historical sites because it is presented from the viewpoint of the enslaved people, not the plantation owners. We were very fortunate that Yvonne, one of our tour leaders, had worked for Whitney Plantation until very recently and was able to tailor our tour to the theme of our journey. The tour included not only the Big House of the plantation, but also the areas where many of the enslaved people worked, such as the cooking areas, and their living quarters. We also were introduced to the evolution of the plantation, from early days farming indigo to sugar cane farming. There were memorial walls commemorating the many enslaved people who worked at the plantation, giving us an idea of the scale of the slavery at this one plantation.</p>

<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/img_8725-edited.jpg"></a>Memorial walls showing names of enslaved people who had worked at the plantation




<p>While at the Whitney, Konda Mason, an entrepreneur who leads an organization called <a href="https://www.jubileejustice.org">Jubilee Justice</a>, spoke to us about the work they are doing. Jubilee Justice is working to improve the business climate for Black rice farmers in Louisiana and Arkansas. One of their main initiatives is to establish a cooperative rice mill in order to give the local farmers a more equitable and cost effective way to get their rice to market.</p>



<p>After returning from the Whitney, we took a short break and then had dinner at <a href="https://ninerosesrestaurant.com">9 Roses</a> with several leaders from the local Vietnamese community. New Orleans has a significant Vietnamese community, dating from the 1975 evacuation during the Communist takeover of South Vietnam. Some are engaged in fishing and shrimping, which had been their occupations in Vietnam. Our dinner table included a leader from the real estate industry who was part of that 1975 migration and a Catholic priest who had relatively recently moved to the United States. It was informative to see the similarities and differences between these generations of immigrants. The food was excellent!</p>

Beignets are fried choux pastries with piles, and I mean piles, of powdered sugar on top. While we were eating, a brass band assembled on the sidewalk next to the Café and started playing. They were very good, a classic New Orleans moment.</p>



<p>The four of us headed over to the nearby <a href="https://www.nps.gov/jela/index.htm/index.htm">Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve</a> Visitor Center. We got there in time for their 10 am talk. It began with an interesting discussion of the Acadian expulsion from the Canadian Maritimes, and subsequent arrival of many of them in the New Orleans area. This was followed by a talk we were less interested in, discussing medicinal properties of native plants.   Afterwards we enjoyed a number of interesting exhibits in the visitor center.</p>



<p>While we were listening to the talks, Liz and Peter went through the <a href="https://louisianastatemuseum.org/museum/cabildo">Louisiana state museum in The Cabildo</a>, a notable building next to the iconic St. Louis Cathedral. This is the location where the Louisiana Purchase was signed. We understand admission was $10, and not necessarily worth the cost.</p>



<p>We met up with Liz and Peter again for lunch. We had planned to get muffuletta sandwiches, but weren’t sure where to get them since the traditional place, Central Grocery and Deli, was closed due to damage from Hurricane Ida. We found a place in the French Market, Alberto’s, that had good muffulettas but perhaps not quite as rich in olives as those at Central Grocery.</p>



<p>After lunch, we all went to the <a href="https://www.hnoc.org/">Historic New Orleans Collection</a> museum on Royal Street near our hotel. Admission was free, and there was plenty to see. Visiting this museum helped us better follow the series of events as control of New Orleans passed from France to Spain, back to France, and finally to the United States. Definitely worth the visit.</p>



<p>At 3 pm our tour officially started. We gathered in a conference room of the hotel for introductions and a brief orientation. We then walked north to Congo Square, just outside the French Quarter. Congo Square was the location where slaves who might be given a Sunday off (due to the strong Roman Catholic influence in the area) would gather, dance and sing, and trade wares. We met up with Luther Gray and Jamilah Peters-Muhammad of the <a href="https://www.congosquarepreservationsociety.org/">Congo Square Preservation Society</a> who told us of the considerable history of the Square. They taught us drumming and dancing in the traditional style, or at least as close as we could come to that.</p>

<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2022/11/img_8708.jpg"></a>




<p>We were then met by Erin, an official New Orleans tour guide, who led us on a whirlwind walking tour of some of the French Quarter. Erin had a lot of information, and talked fast to get as much of it to us as possible.</p>



<p>After a few minutes to get cleaned up, the group walked to <a href="https://www.galatoires.com/">Galatoire’s</a>, a well known (and fancy) restaurant in the French Quarter. Our group had a private room and a selection of menu items to choose from. I had to try the turtle soup, which resembled a thin chili and was very tasty. My fish entrée and Kenna’s crab hollandaise were both quite good.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rackspace_Technology">Rackspace</a> is in a crater right now, on fire.</p>
<p>So are many of its customers. I’m one of them.</p>
<p>What happened, <a href="https://status.apps.rackspace.com/index/viewincidents?start=1670216400">Rackspace says</a>, was “the result of a ransomware incident.” Damaged, lost or destroyed is its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rackspace.com/applications/microsoft-exchange">Hosted Exchange</a> business.&nbsp;On that cloud platform, companies and individuals around the world run their email and much else.</p>
<p>It’s quite a saga.</p>
<p>The first report from Rackspace came at 11:49pm Pacific (where I am) on Thursday, posted on its <a href="https://status.apps.rackspace.com/index/viewincidents?group=2">Incidents page</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are investigating an issue that is affecting our Hosted Exchange environments. More details will be posted as they become available.</p></blockquote>
<p>Updates got more wordy as the outage continued. About a day later, a long posting said,</p>
<blockquote><p>We proactively powered down and disconnected the Hosted Exchange environment while we triaged to understand the extent and the severity of the impact. After further analysis, we have determined that this is a security incident.</p></blockquote>
<p>They also offered a lifeline of sorts:</p>
<blockquote><p>At no cost to you, we will be providing access to Microsoft Exchange Plan 1 licenses on Microsoft 365 until further notice. At no cost to you, we will be providing access to Microsoft Exchange Plan 1 licenses on Microsoft 365 until further notice. To activate, please use the below link for instructions on how to set up your account and users.</p></blockquote>
<p>For reasons not worth going into, this was useless to me. But I’m also just one guy, and almost all of Rackspace’s customers are businesses with more to lose.</p>
<p>Getting help from Rackspace quickly became difficult or impossible, while details about the situation were minimal, until this morning (6 December), when they said it was a ransomware incident. Which <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=rackspace%20ransom&amp;src=typed_query">countless tweets had been suggesting</a> from the start.</p>
<p>Here is what Rackspace said it was doing about it:</p>
<blockquote><p>Alongside our internal security team, we have engaged a leading cyber defense firm to investigate. Our investigation is still in its early stages, and it is too early to say what, if any, data was affected. If we determine sensitive information was affected, we will notify customers as appropriate.</p></blockquote>
<p>No FBI? CIA? NSA? DHS? Police? My guess is that at least two of those have been notified because it would make sense for them to be involved. But I’m sure abundant caution on Rackspace’s part is the reason we’re not hearing about any of that.</p>
<p>As for notifying customers, good luck. In a posting two days ago, Rackspace said,</p>
<blockquote><p>For those who are finding the process challenging and are awaiting support, we ask for your patience as we increase staff to help every customer. Since our last update, we have mobilized roughly 1000 support Rackers to reduce wait times and address ticket queues. We will continue to accelerate and deploy even more resources to further help customers.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=rackspace%20wait&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live">Search for Rackspace+wait on Twitter</a> to see how that’s going.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning I chose the “we’ll call you back asap” option at the Rackspace support number, after calling them fruitlessly before that. Since then, crickets. Meanwhile, I’ve been working almost non-stop on moving my email hosting to <a href="https://www.hover.com/email">Hover</a>, which answers the phone quickly and is always helpful.</p>
<p>Of course, I haven’t been able to export anything from Rackspace, and I have growing doubts that I ever will. If the failure is total, many details of my life in the digital world will be lost forever.</p>
<p>One bit of good fortune is that my wife and sister, who both also have&nbsp;<a href="http://searls.com" title="http://searls. ">searls.com</a> email addresses, were on Rackspace’s basic non-Exchange email service. Since that was still working today,&nbsp;we could export their mail archive from Rackspace as .mbox files, and start new accounts for them on Hover. (Ironically, I moved to Rackspace’s Exchange service because I punched through the basic service’s 25Gb limit on storage, and they sold me on the Exchange service’s better security.)</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransomware">Ramsomware</a> is bad shit. If you’re Rackspace or one of its customers, there is plenty to fear.</p>
<p>But the larger story here isn’t about Rackspace or its customers. It’s about the cloud business, which is beyond massive.</p>
<p>I’ve been looking for examples of cloud failures that are bigger than this one. <a href="https://readitquik.com/articles/cloud-3/6-cloud-computing-failures-that-shocked-the-world/">Here’s a list</a> from five years ago. <a href="https://www.crn.com/news/cloud/the-10-biggest-cloud-outages-of-2022-so-far-">Here is one</a>&nbsp;from July of this year. <a href="https://www.networkcomputing.com/cloud-infrastructure/lessons-learned-recent-major-outages">Here is one</a> from August. Most list disruptions lasting hours. This one has been going on for five days with no end in sight.</p>
<p>So let’s imagine that Rackspace and its customers are stuck in that crater, and it just keeps burning. For years. What are the lessons from that?</p>
<p>[Later, on 10 December…] <a href="https://doublepulsar.com/rackspace-cloud-office-suffers-security-breach-958e6c755d7f">This report by Kevin Beaumont</a> on the Rackspace catastrophe (which continues) is long on technical and administrative details that nobody else seems to be reporting, and is damning to Microsoft as well.</p>

<p>
I was determined to write my Mastodon #introduction today. To get started I used the tag search in the dashboard I’m building.
</p>
 
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/mastodon-tag-search-kathy-nickels-in-the-mod3.jpg?ssl=1"></a>
 
<p>
The idea was to look at a bunch of other #introduction posts to get a feel for how mine should go. When you search specifically for hashtags, the Mastodon search API returns this information.</p>
 "hashtags": [
    {
      "name": "introduction",
      "url": "https://mastodon.social/tags/introduction",
      "history": [
        {
          "day": "1574553600",
          "uses": "10",
          "accounts": "9"
        },
        // ...
      ]
    },
 
<p>
A first version of the dashboard, having only this data to work with, just listed the names of tags matching the search term along with corresponding URLs. Here was the initial query.
</p>
 select 
  name,
  url
from 
  mastodon_search_hashtag 
where 
  query = 'introduction'
 
<p>
That produced a list of links, like <a href="https://mastodon.social/tags/introduction">https://mastodon.social/tags/introduction</a>, to home pages for variants of the tag. These are useful links! Each goes to a page where you can see who is posting to the tag.
</p>
<p>
To make this view slightly more useful, I tapped the third element of the API response, history, in a revised query.
</p>
 with data as (
  select 
    name,
    url,
    ( jsonb_array_elements(history) -&gt;&gt; 'uses' )::int as uses
  from 
    mastodon_search_hashtag 
  where 
    query = 'introduction'
)
select
  name,
  url,
  sum(uses)
from
  data
group by
  name, url
order by
  sum desc
 
<p>
These results help me decide which variant to use.
</p>
 +-------------------+---------------------------------------------------+------+
| name              | url                                               | sum  |
+-------------------+---------------------------------------------------+------+
| introduction      | https://mastodon.social/tags/introduction         | 1816 |
| introductions     | https://mastodon.social/tags/introductions        | 218  |
| introductionpost  | https://mastodon.social/tags/introductionpost     | 19   |
| introductionfr    | https://mastodon.social/tags/introductionfr       | 6    |
 
<p>
But I still need to visit each link’s page to explore how it’s being used. It would be nice to surface more context in the dashboard, and I found a nifty way to do it, but first let’s dwell on the revised query for a minute. Postgres’ <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/08/15/postgres-and-json-finding-document-hotspots-part-1/">JSON features</a> are powerful and it’s often a challenge (at least for me) to visualize how they work.
</p>
<p>
The Postgres jsonb_array_elements() function is what’s called a set-returning function. Here it unpacks Postgres’ JSON representation of the list of history structures returned from the Mastodon API. In its simplest form, the function call jsonb_array_elements(history) produces a temporary table with per-tag, per-day data.
</p>
 select
  name,
  jsonb_array_elements(history) as history
from
  mastodon_search_hashtag 
where 
  query = 'introduction'
 
 +--------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| name                           | history                                            |
+--------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| introduction                   | {"accounts":"16","day":"1670371200","uses":"19"}   |
| introduction                   | {"accounts":"250","day":"1670284800","uses":"269"} |
| introduction                   | {"accounts":"259","day":"1670198400","uses":"274"} |
| introduction                   | {"accounts":"253","day":"1670112000","uses":"270"} |
| introduction                   | {"accounts":"245","day":"1670025600","uses":"269"} |
| introduction                   | {"accounts":"345","day":"1669939200","uses":"383"} |
| introduction                   | {"accounts":"307","day":"1669852800","uses":"339"} |
| introductionsfr                | {"accounts":"0","day":"1670371200","uses":"0"}     |
| introductionsfr                | {"accounts":"0","day":"1670284800","uses":"0"}     |
| introductionsfr                | {"accounts":"0","day":"1670198400","uses":"0"}     |
| introductionsfr                | {"accounts":"0","day":"1670112000","uses":"0"}     |
| introductionsfr                | {"accounts":"0","day":"1670025600","uses":"0"}     |
 
<p>
history is a JSONB column that holds an object with three fields. The revised query uses Postgres’ JSON indexing operator -&gt;&gt; to reach into that object and hoist the number of daily uses into its own column, so it can be the target of a SQL SUM function.
</p>
<p>
OK, ready for the nifty solution? Recall that <a href="https://mastodon.social/tags/introduction">https://mastodon.social/tags/introduction</a> is the home page for that variant of the tag. There you can see introduction posts from people using the tag. Those posts typically include other tags. In the dashboard shown above you can see that Kathy Nickels is using these: #Music #Art #Equestrian #Nature #Animals. The tags appear in her introduction post.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/mastodon-tag-search-kathy-nickels-in-the-app.png?ssl=1"></a>
</p>
<p>
I didn’t immediately see how to capture them for use in the dashboard. Then I remembered that certain classes of Mastodon page have corresponding RSS feeds, and wondered if the tag pages are members of one such class. Sure enough they are, and <a href="https://mastodon.social/tags/introduction.rss">https://mastodon.social/tags/introduction.rss</a> is a thing. That link, formed by tacking .rss onto the base URL, provides the extra context I was looking for. Here’s the final version of the query.
</p>
 with data as (
  select 
    name,
    url,
    ( jsonb_array_elements(history) -&gt;&gt; 'uses' )::int as uses
  from 
    mastodon_search_hashtag 
  where 
    query = 'introduction'
  ),
  uses as (
    select 
      name,
      url || '.rss' as feed_link,
      sum(uses) as recent_uses
    from 
      data 
    group 
      by connection, name, url
  )
  select
    u.name,
    r.guid as link,
    to_char(r.published, 'YYYY-MM-DD') as published,
    r.categories
  from
    uses u
  join
    rss_item r
  on 
    r.feed_link = u.feed_link
  where
    recent_uses &gt; 1
  order by 
    recent_uses desc, published desc
)
 
<p>
The new ingredients, courtesy of the RSS feed, are: guid which links to an individual introduction like Kathy’s, published which is the day the introduction appeared, and categories which has the tags used in the introduction post. Sweet! Now I can scan the dashboard to get a sense of which introductions I want to check out.
</p>
<p>
The first three queries use the <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-mastodon">Steampipe plugin for Mastodon</a>, and in particular its mastodon_search_hashtag table which encapsulates the Mastodon API for searching tags. The final version joins that table with the <a href="https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/rss/tables/rss_item">rss_item</a> table provided by the <a href="https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/rss">RSS plugin</a>, using the common base URL as the basis of the join.
</p>
<p>
This delights me in so many ways. When the blogosphere first emerged in the early 2000s, some of us discovered that the RSS protocol was capable of far more than just delivering feeds to RSS readers. The other new hot protocol in that era was XML web services. As an InfoWorld analyst I was supposed to be cheering the latter as an enterprise-grade technology, but I couldn’t help noticing that RSS kept turning out to be a great way to move data between cooperating systems. That’s always been true, and I love how this example reminds us that it’s still true.
</p>
<p>
I’m equally delighted to show how Steampipe enables this modern exercise in RSS-powered integration. Steampipe was, originally, an engine for mapping results from JSON API endpoints to SQL tables. Over time, though, it has broadened its view of what constitutes an API. You can use Steampipe to query CSV files, or <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3659794/do-your-aws-deployments-match-your-terraform-definitions-use-sql-to-find-out.html">Terraform files</a>, or — as we see here — RSS feeds. Data comes in all kinds of flavors. Steampipe abstracts those differences and brings all the flavors into a common space where you can reason over them using SQL.
</p>
<p>
And finally, it’s just wonderful to be at the intersection of Mastodon, Steampipe, and RSS in this remarkable moment. I’ll readily admit that nostalgia is a factor. But RSS did bust things wide open twenty years ago, Mastodon’s doing that now, and I love that RSS can help it happen again.
</p>
<p>
Now I need to write that #introduction!

<p>Continuing with our tradition of publishing a journal of significant travels, this begins a journal of our recent trip to the US South, focused on Race, Equity, and American Identity. Posts will be added approximately daily, and are delayed 7 weeks from the actual events.</p>
  



 



<p>Tuesday, October 18, 2022</p>



<p>Kenna and I left today on what will be our first fully-guided land trip. This is a thematic trip entitled Race, Equity, &amp; American Identity that was organized by <a href="https://www.sv2.org/">SV2</a>, a local philanthropic organization that Kenna and I are partners in. The trip was planned and will be led by <a href="https://www.telosgroup.org/">Telos</a>, an organization that is best described by their mission statement:</p>



<blockquote><p>We form communities of American peacemakers across lines of difference, and equip them to help reconcile seemingly intractable conflicts at home and abroad.</p>Telos mission statement</blockquote>



<p>We have had a couple of pre-trip meetings with our group. The group consists of about 16 people, which includes our friends Liz and Peter who expressed interest when Kenna told them about the trip. We decided to leave a day early to get acclimated to the time change, to have some time to re-explore New Orleans on our own, and to avoid missing any of the program on the actual first day.</p>




<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2022/11/img_8670.jpg"></a>




<p>Our travel today was wonderfully drama-free. The ride to the airport was right on time, we met up with Peter and Liz at SFO airport, and our flight was on-time and comfortable. We got to our hotel, the <a href="https://www.omnihotels.com/hotels/new-orleans-royal-orleans">Omni Royal</a>, in the late afternoon with enough time to walk around and explore. We walked around the French Quarter quite a bit, through Jackson Square, and down to the Mississippi River waterfront. The river seemed to be a little low but not as much as we expected.</p>



<p>While walking around, we read various menus to get ideas for dinner. We were in a touristy part of the French Quarter, so many places seemed the wrong style, too expensive or both. Consulting online resources, we decided on a high-rated barbecue place named <a href="https://www.pigoutnolabbq.com/">Pig Out</a>. It was very small and informal, and the food was excellent.</p>



<p>Having had just a few hours of sleep last night, we decided to turn in early, even considering the two hour time change.</p>

 <p>Which one of the roles is the most challenging, as both are isolated and unforgiving? In either position, the opposition will not like you when you're doing well.&nbsp; When doing badly, your supporters are not on your side.&nbsp; Irrespective of if it is a good or bad day in the office, everyone else knows they can do your job better than you can, and your backers are never happy, always wanting more.&nbsp; So what is the toughest position?&nbsp;</p> Being ahead  If you're thinking three, four, or five plays ahead, you're not suitable for this role. <p>There is a reality to both roles that you have to be ahead, to be in the right position at the right time to ensure success, but everyone else just thinks you are lucky.&nbsp; Anyone can do the job, but those who can see signals and read the play will excel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Blame  No matter how many great things you do, everyone only remembers you for the one you missed <p>In either position, you have to accept that you’re the last person in the line of defence, and you will regularly take the brunt of the criticism when it goes wrong. But these abilities, to remain humble and stay positive combined with power, agility, and quickness, make those in these positions the strongest leaders.</p> Touchline criticism  They need an element of insanity, as there is no hiding place. <p>Criticisms from the sideline can be heard when you stand in one spot; their views are loud and clear.&nbsp; Abuse is particularly annoying when you know the media and crowd have zero experience with your role and do not know the context.&nbsp;</p><p>The bottom line is that you have to ignore all those distractions. People on the sidelines are fickle. Anything you do — good or bad — will alter their opinions on you pretty quickly. Stick to what you're good at, and you’ll prove them wrong.</p><br> Preparation  Success depends upon previous preparation; without such preparation, there will surely be failure. <p>In lower levels, particularly in SMEs and youth football, there’s a tendency to stick the CEO in position or the keeper in goal and pelt multiple objects their way from point blank range. It’s one of the worst ways for a leader to prepare.&nbsp; A leader will take charge and create proper warmup routines, which others feel do not warm them up and this creates tensions and conflicts.</p> Messy  So there’s an enormous blue frog with your name on it. <p>The CEO deals with people and all the messy complications people bring to any team.&nbsp; A goalie has to deal with a muddy puddle that is cold and wet.&nbsp; Those who lead deal with how they will approach it before they play and not during.</p><br> Training  Coaching is not the filling of a pot but the lighting of a fire <p>It’s 10 of them for every 1 of you. Unfortunately, CEOs and goalkeepers are regularly neglected in team coaching and training sessions. With so many players to work on, leaders and keepers don’t receive the attention they need as they are unique and special; however, they are the ones who can lift everyone else.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br> Second chance  Is it unprecedented for two CEOs or goalkeepers in competition can both enjoy the result? <p>Being a CEO or goalkeeper is the most unforgiving position and offers little opportunity for redemption. Sales directors and strikers, for example, can make several poor efforts at a goal and then “get into” the game. If they land the deal or score, those poor efforts are entirely forgotten.&nbsp;</p><p>When you step out, you have to be ready because redemption is an uphill struggle. If you make a mistake, you may not get another chance to put it right. You can only keep your head up, stay focused, and learn from it.</p> Alone on a bad day&nbsp;  Only a CEO can understand the challenges faced by a goalkeeper. <p>There’s nothing worse than the journey home when you’re kicking yourself over a mistake you made. It’s those key moments that ruin an evening or weekend for everyone. CEOs and goalkeepers truly carry the burden of their errors. No other position holds themselves singularly responsible. With that in mind, it’s unsurprising that some professionals have to quit for a lifestyle with a little less stress. Mental strength, a positive attitude and the determination to go again are required. Wounds will heal. CEO and keepers are easily victimised by their high level of responsibility. It takes guts to be one.</p> With all that said  Only an outstanding leader can make their team victorious. <br>

  A quick tip for speeding up Perl builds in GitHub workflows by caching dependencies.

<p>I’ve spent quite a few hours evenings and weekends recently building out a
comprehensive suite of <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/sqitch/actions">GitHub Actions for Sqitch</a>. They cover a dozen versions
of Perl, nearly 70 database versions amongst nine database engines, plus a
coverage test and a release workflow. A pull request can expect over 100 actions
to run. Each build requires over 100 direct dependencies, plus all their
dependencies. Installing them for every build would make any given run
untenable.</p>
<p>Happily, GitHub Actions include a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/advanced-guides/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows" title="GitHub Actions: “Caching dependencies to speed up workflows”">caching feature</a>, and thanks to a
<a href="https://github.com/shogo82148/actions-setup-perl/pull/892">recent improvement to shogo82148/actions-setup-perl</a>,
it’s quite easy to use in a version-independent way. Here’s an example:</p>
  <code>name: Test
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  OS:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ ubuntu, macos, windows ]
        perl: [ 'latest', '5.34', '5.32', '5.30', '5.28' ]
    name: Perl ${{ matrix.perl }} on ${{ matrix.os }}
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Source
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Perl
        id: perl
        uses: shogo82148/actions-setup-perl@v1
        with: { perl-version: "${{ matrix.perl }}" }
      - name: Cache CPAN Modules
        uses: actions/cache@v3
        with:
          path: local
          key: perl-${{ steps.perl.outputs.perl-hash }}
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: cpm install --verbose --show-build-log-on-failure --no-test --cpanfile cpanfile
      - name: Run Tests
        env: { PERL5LIB: "${{ github.workspace }}/local/lib/perl5" }
        run: prove -lrj4
</code>  <p>This workflow tests every permutation of OS and Perl version specified in
<code>jobs.OS.strategy.matrix</code>, resulting in 15 jobs. The <code>runs-on</code> value determines
the OS, while the <code>steps</code> section defines steps for each permutation. Let’s take
each step in turn:</p>
 
 “Checkout Source” checks the project out of GitHub. Pretty much required for
any project. 
 “Setup Perl” sets up the version of Perl using the value from the matrix.
Note the <code>id</code> key set to <code>perl</code>, used in the next step. 
 “Cache CPAN Modules” uses the <a href="https://github.com/actions/cache">cache action</a> to cache the directory named
<code>local</code> with the key <code>perl-${{ steps.perl.outputs.perl-hash }}</code>. The key
lets us keep different versions of the <code>local</code> directory based on a unique
key. Here we’ve used the <code>perl-hash</code> output from the <code>perl</code> step defined
above. The <code>actions-setup-perl</code> action outputs this value, which contains a
hash of the output of <code>perl -V</code>, so we’re tying the cache to a very specific
version and build of Perl. This is important since compiled modules are not
compatible across major versions of Perl. 
 “Install Dependencies” uses <a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/App-cpm/view/script/cpm" title="cpm - a fast CPAN module installer"><code>cpm</code></a> to quickly install Perl dependencies. By
default, it puts them into the <code>local</code> subdirectory of the current directory
— just where we configured the cache. On the first run for a given OS and
Perl version, it will install all the dependencies. But on subsequent runs
it will find the dependencies already present, thank to the cache, and
quickly exit, reporting “All requirements are satisfied.” In <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/sqitch/runs/4275487924?check_suite_focus=true">this Sqitch
job</a>, it takes less than a second. 
 “Run Tests” runs the tests that require the dependencies. It requires the
<code>PERL5LIB</code> environment variable to point to the location of our cached
dependencies. 
 
<p>That’s the whole deal. The first run will be the slowest, depending on the
number of dependencies, but subsequent runs will be much faster, up to the
seven-day caching period. For a complex project like Sqitch, which uses the same
OS and Perl version for most of its actions, this results in a tremendous build
time savings. CI configurations we’ve used in the past often took an hour or
more to run. Today, most builds take only a few minutes to test, with longer
times determined not by dependency installation but by container and database
latency.</p>

<p>I’d been chatting with <a href="https://identitywoman.net/">Kaliya Identity Woman</a> for around a year, after contacting her about the potential for our collaborating on decentralized identity. At some point, she proposed the idea of writing a newsletter together, under the <a href="https://identosphere.net">Identosphere.net</a> domain.</p>

<p>Before embarking upon this project, we spent a lot of time figuring out how to run a newsletter: sustainably, affordably and with as few third party services as possible, while I learn the use of various web-tools.</p>

<p>We’re tackling a field that touches every domain, has a deep history, and is currently growing faster than anyone can keep up with. But this problem of fast-moving information streams isn’t unique to digital identity, and what we learn here could be of use in any conceivable domain.</p>

 GitHub Pages 

<p>I started in Decentralized ID creating freelance content, and ended up building an Awesome List, to organize my findings. Once that list outgrew the Awesome format, I began learning to create static web-sites with <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> and <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>.</p>

<p>I saved some useful guides along that path in my <a href="https://web-work.tools/jamstack/github-pages-starter-pack/">GitHub Pages Starter Pack</a></p>

<p>Static Websites are great for security and require minimal infrastructure, but if you’re trying to create any type of business online, you’re gonna want some forms so you can begin collecting e-mail subscribers! Forms are not supported natively through Jekyll or GitHub Pages.</p>

 Enter Staticman 

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: I’m not currently using these forms, because I didn’t have the energy to maintain, verses the use they were getting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://github.com/eduardoboucas/staticman">Staticman</a> is a comments engine for static websites, but can be used for any kind of form, with the proper precautions.</p>

<p>It can be deployed to Heroku with a click of a button, made into a GitHub App, or run on your own server. Once set up, it will submit a pull-request to your repository with the form details (and an optional <a href="https://www.mailgun.com/">mailgun</a> integration).</p>

<p>I set it up on my own server and created a <a href="https://travisdowns.github.io/blog/2020/02/05/now-with-comments.html">bot account on GitHub</a> with permissions to a private repository for the Staticman app to update with subscriptions e-mails to.</p>

<p>Made the form, and a <code>staticman.yml</code> config file in the root of the private repository where I’m collecting e-mail addresses.</p>

 The Subscription Form 

   <code>&lt;center&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Subscribe for Updates&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;form class="staticman" method="POST" action="https://identosphere.net/staticman/v2/entry/infominer33/subscribe/master/subscribe"&gt;
    &lt;input name="options[redirect]" type="hidden" value="https://infominer.xyz/subscribed"&gt;
    &lt;input name="options[slug]" type="hidden" value="infohub"&gt;
    &lt;input name="fields[name]" type="text" placeholder="Name (optional)"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;input name="fields[email]" type="email" placeholder="Email"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;input name="fields[message]" type="text" placeholder="Areas of Interest (optional)"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;input name="links" type="hidden" placeholder="links"&gt;
    &lt;button type="submit"&gt;Subscribe&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
</code>   
 The staticman.yml config in the root of my private subscribe repo 

   <code>subscribe:
  allowedFields: ["name", "email", "message"]
  allowedOrigins: ["infominer.xyz","identosphere.net"]
  branch: "master"
  commitMessage: "New subscriber: {fields.name}"
  filename: "subscribe-{@timestamp}"

  path: "{options.slug}" 
  requiredFields: ["email"]
</code>   

<p>It seems to be <a href="https://github.com/eduardoboucas/staticman/issues/366#issuecomment-726016008">struggling with GitHub’s recent move</a> to change the name of your default branch from master to main (for new repositories). So, unfortunately, I had to re-create a master branch to get it running.</p>

 Planet Pluto Feed Reader 

<blockquote>
  <p>In online media a planet is a feed aggregator application designed to collect posts from the weblogs of members of an internet community and display them on a single page. - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_(software)">Planet (Software)</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the most promising projects I found, in pursuit of keeping up with all the info, is <a href="https://github.com/web-work-tools/awesome-planet-pluto">Planet Pluto Feed Reader</a>, by Gerald Bauer.</p>

<p>For the uninitiated, I should mention that websites typically generate a machine readable copy of your blog in what’s called an RSS feed.</p>

<p>This allows anyone to follow your content in a newsreader, allowing users to keep up with posts from multiple locations without needing to visit each site individually.</p>

<p>Pluto Feed reader works just like a podcast app, but builds a simple webpage from the feeds added to it (or can be integrated with a Jekyll template).</p>

<p><a href="http://planet-templates.github.io/"></a></p>

<p>Pluto is built with <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>, using the <a href="https://www.stuartellis.name/articles/erb/">ERB templating</a> language for <a href="https://github.com/planet-templates">web-page design</a>.</p>

<p>One of the cool things about ERB is it lets you use any ruby function in your web-page template, supporting any capability you might want to enable while rendering your news feed. This project has greatly helped me to learn the basics of Ruby while customizing its templates to suit my needs.</p>

 Feed Search 

<p>I use the <a href="https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub-Radar">RSSHub Radar</a> browser extension to find feeds for sites while I’m browsing. However, this would be a lot of work when I want to get feeds for a number of sites at once.</p>

<p>I found a few simple python apps that find feeds for me. They aren’t perfect, but they do allow me to find feeds for multiple sites at the same time, all I have to do is format the query and hit enter.</p>

<p>As you can see below, these are not fully formed applications, just a few lines of code. To run them, it’s necessary to install <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python</a>, install the package with <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pip/">pip</a> (<code>pip install feedsearch-crawler</code>), and type <code>python</code> at the command prompt, which takes you to a Python terminal that will recognize these commands.</p>

<p>From there you can type\paste python commands for demonstration, practice, or for simple scripts like this. I could also put the following scripts into their own feedsearch.py file and type <code>python feedsearch.py</code>,  but I haven’t gotten around to doing anything like that.</p>

<p>Depending on the site, and the features you’re interested in, either of these feed seekers has their merits.</p>

 Feedsearch Crawler 

 
   <a href="https://github.com/DBeath/feedsearch-crawler">DBeath/feedsearch-crawler</a> 
 

   <code>from feedsearch_crawler import search
import logging
logging.basicConfig(filename='example.log',level=logging.DEBUG)
import output_opml
list = ["http://bigfintechmedia.com/Blog/","http://blockchainespana.com/","http://blog.deanland.com/"]
for items in list:
    feeds = search(items)
    output_opml(feeds).decode()
    logger = logging.getLogger("feedsearch_crawler")
</code>   

 Feed seeker 

 
   <a href="https://github.com/mitmedialab/feed_seeker">mitmedialab/feed_seeker</a> 
 

   <code>from feed_seeker import generate_feed_urls
list = ["http://bigfintechmedia.com/Blog/","http://blockchainespana.com/","http://blog.deanland.com/"]
for items in list:
    for url in generate_feed_urls(items):
        print(url)
</code>   

 GitHub Actions 

<p>Pluto Feed Reader is great, but I needed to find a way for it to run a regular schedule, so I wouldn’t have to run the command every time I wanted to check for new feeds. For this, I’ve used <a href="https://github.com/actions/setup-python">GitHub actions</a>.</p>

<p>This is an incredible feature of GitHub that allows you to spin up a virtual machine, install an operating system, dependencies supporting your application, and whatever commands you’d like to run, on a schedule.</p>

   <code>name: Build BlogCatcher
on:
  schedule:
    # This action runs 4x a day.
    - cron:  '0/60 */4 * * *'
  push:
    paths:

    - 'planetid.ini'

 Identosphere Blogcatcher 

<p><a href="https://identosphere.net/"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://identosphere.net/">Identosphere Blogcatcher</a> (<a href="https://github.com/identosphere/planetid-reboot">source</a>) is a feed aggregator for personal blogs of people who’ve been working on digital identity through the years, inspired by the original <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161029051802/http://planetidentity.org/">Planet Identity</a>.</p>

<p>We also have a page for <a href="https://identosphere.net/companies/">companies</a>, and another for <a href="https://identosphere.net/organizations/">organizations</a> working in the field.</p>

 Identosphere Weekly Highlights 

<p>After we got these pages up and running, we were ready to start our newsletter. This is just a small piece of the information portal we’re working towards, and not enough to make this project as painless and comprehensive as possible, but we had enough to get started.</p>

<p>Every week, we get browse the [BlogCatcher]identosphere.net), and share essential content others in our field will appreciate.</p>

<p>We’ll be publishing our 6th edition, at the start of next week, and our numbers are doing well!</p>

<p></p>

<p>This newsletter is free, and a great opportunity for us to work together on something consistent while developing a few other ideas.</p>

 <a href="https://newsletter.identosphere.net/">newsletter.identosphere.net</a> 

<p>Setting up a newsletter without third-party intermediaries is more of a challenge than I’m currently up for, so we’ve settled on Substack for now, which seems to be a trending platform for tech newsletters.</p>

<p>It has a variety of options for both paid and free content, and you can read our content before subscribing.</p>

 <a href="https://www.patreon.com/identosphere">Support us on Patreon</a> 

<p>While keeping the newsletter free, we are accepting contributions via Patreon. (yes another intermediary, but we can draw upon a large existing userbase, and it’s definitely easier than setting up a self-hosted alternative.)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/identosphere"></a></p>

<p>So far, we have enough to cover a bit more than server costs, and this will ideally grow to support our efforts, and enable us to sustainably continue developing these open informational projects.</p>

 Python, Twitter Api, and GitHub Actions 

<p>Since we’re publishing this newsletter, and I’ve gotten a better handle on my inner state, I decided it was time to come back to twitter. However, I knew I couldn’t do it the old way, where I manually re-tweeted everything of interest, spending hours a day scrolling multiple accounts trying to stay abreast of important developments.</p>

<p>Instead, I dove into the twitter api. The benefits of using twitter programmatically can’t be understated. For my first project, I decided to try an auto-poster, which could enable me to keep an active twitter account, without having to regularly pay attention to twitter.</p>

<p>I found a simple guide <a href="https://dototot.com/how-to-write-a-twitter-bot-with-python-and-tweepy/">How To Write a Twitter Bot with Python and tweepy</a> composed of a dozen lines of python. That simple script posts a tweet to your account, but I wanted to post from a pre-made list, and so figured out how to read from a <a href="https://yaml.org/">yaml</a> file, and then used <a href="https://github.com/actions/setup-python">GitHub actions</a> to run the script on a regular schedule.</p>

<p>While that didn’t result in anything I’m ready to share here, quite yet, somewhere during that process I realized that I could write python. After playing around with Ruby, in ERB, to build the BlogCatcher, and running various python scripts that other people wrote, tinkering where necessary, eventually I had pieced together enough knowledge I could actually write my own code!</p>

 Decentralized ID Weekly Twitter Collections 

<p>With that experience as a foundation I knew I was ready to come <a href="https://twitter.com/DecentralizeID/">back to Twitter</a>, begin trying to make more efficient use of its wealth of knowledge, and see about keeping up my accounts without losing too much hair.</p>

<p>I made <a href="https://gist.github.com/vickyqian/f70e9ab3910c7c290d9d715491cde44c">a script that searches twitter</a> for a variety of keywords related to decentralized identity, and write the tweet text and some other attributes to a csv file. From there, I can sort through those tweets, and save only the most relevant, and publish a few hundred tweets about decentralized identity to a weekly <a href="https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/creating-a-twitter-collection-via-api-1378ecfe20df">twitter collection</a>, that make our job a lot easier than going to 100’s of websites to find out what’s happening. :D</p>

<p>Soon, these will be regularly published to <a href="https://decentralized-id.com">decentralized-id.com</a>, which I found out is an approved method of re-publishing tweets, unlike the ad hoc method I was using before, sharing them to discord channels (which grabs metadata and displays the preview image \ text), exporting their contents and re-publishing that.</p>

<p>I do intend to share my source for all that after I’ve gotten the kinks worked out, and set it running on an action.</p>

 Twitter collections I’ve made so far 

 
   <a href="https://twitter.com/DecentralizeID/timelines/1322735918386733057">Self Sovereign ID 101</a> 
   <a href="https://twitter.com/DecentralizeID/timelines/1322785746915307520">October Week 5 #SSI #DID</a> 
   <a href="https://twitter.com/DecentralizeID/timelines/1325219075463712769">November Week 1 #SSI #DID</a> 
 

 Decentralized-ID.com 

<p>Now we have a newsletter, and are seeking patrons, it seemed appropriate to work on developing <a href="https://decentralized-id.com/posts/">decentralized-id.com</a>, cleaning up some of its hastily thrown together parts, and adding a bunch of content to better represent the decentralized identity space.</p>

<p>That said, I’ve not given up on <a href="https://bitcoinfo.xyz">Bitcoin</a>, or <a href="https://sourcecrypto.pub">Crypto</a>. On the contrary, I’m sure this work is only expanding my future capacity to continue working to fulfil the original vision of those resources.</p>

 Web-Work.Tools 

<p>With the information and skills i’ve gathered over the past year, <a href="https://web-work.tools">web-work.tools</a> was starting to look pretty out of date, relative to the growth of my understanding.</p>

<p>I updated <a href="https://web-work.tools/jamstack/github-pages-starter-pack/">GitHub Pages Starter Pack \ Extended Resources</a> quite a lot to reflect those learnings, and separate the wheat from the chaff of the links I gathered when I was first figuring out how to use GitHub pages.</p>

<p>Back in June, I wrote about <a href="https://justatheory.com/2020/06/test-extensions-with-github-actions/" title="Test Postgres Extensions With GitHub Actions">testing Postgres extensions</a> on
multiple versions of Postgres using <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a>. The pattern relies on
Docker image, <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pgxn/pgxn-tools">pgxn/pgxn-tools</a>, which contains scripts to build and run any
version of PostgreSQL, install additional dependencies, build, test, bundle, and
release an extension. I’ve since updated it to support testing on the the latest
development release of Postgres, meaning one can test on any major version from
8.4 to (currently) 14. I’ve also created GitHub workflows for all of my PGXN
extensions (except for <a href="https://pgtap.org">pgTAP</a>, which is complicated). I’m quite happy with it.</p>
<p>But I was never quite satisfied with the release process. Quite a number of
Postgres extensions also release on GitHub; indeed, <a href="http://blog.cleverelephant.ca">Paul Ramsey</a> told me
straight up that he did not want to manually upload extensions like <a href="https://github.com/pramsey/pgsql-http">pgsql-http</a>
and <a href="http://postgis.net">PostGIS</a> to PGXN, but for PGXN to automatically pull them in when they were
published on GitHub. It’s pretty cool that newer packaging systems like
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev">pkg.go.dev</a> auto-index any packages on GibHub. Adding such a feature to PGXN
would be an interesting exercise.</p>
<p>But since I’m low on TUITs for such a significant undertaking, I decided instead
to work out how to automatically publish a release on GitHub and PGXN via
<a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a>. After experimenting for a few months, I’ve worked out a
straightforward method that should meet the needs of most projects. I’ve proven
the pattern via the <a href="https://github.com/theory/kv-pair/">pair extension</a>’s <a href="https://github.com/theory/kv-pair/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml"><code>release.yml</code></a>, which successfully
published the v0.1.7 release today on both <a href="https://github.com/theory/kv-pair/releases/tag/v0.1.7">GitHub</a> and
<a href="https://pgxn.org/dist/pair/0.1.7/">PGXN</a>. With that success, I updated the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pgxn/pgxn-tools">pgxn/pgxn-tools</a>
documentation with a starter example. It looks like this:</p>

        asset_content_type: application/zip
</code> 
 
 <p>Here’s how it works:</p>
 
 
<p>Lines 4-5 trigger the workflow only when a tag starting with the letter v is
pushed to the repository. This follows the common convention of tagging
releases with version numbers, such as <code>v0.1.7</code> or <code>v4.6.0-dev</code>. This
assumes that the tag represents the commit for the release.</p>
 
 
<p>Line 10 specifies that the job run in the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pgxn/pgxn-tools">pgxn/pgxn-tools</a> container, where
we have our tools for building and releasing extensions.</p>
 
 
<p>Line 13 passes the <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> variable into the container. This is the
GitHub <a href="https://github.com/settings/tokens/new">personal access token</a> that’s automatically set for every build. It
lets us call the <a href="https://docs.github.com/">GitHub API</a> via actions later in the workflow.</p>
 
 
<p>Step “Bundle the Release”, on Lines 17-19, validates the extension
<code>META.json</code> file and creates the release zip file. It does so by simply
reading the distribution name and version from the <code>META.json</code> file and
archiving the Git repo into a zip file. If your process for creating a
release file is more complicated, you can do it yourself here; just be sure
to include an <code>id</code> for the step, and emit a line of text so that later
actions know what file to release. The output should be appended to the
<code>$GITHUB_OUTPUT</code> file like this, with <code>$filename</code> representing the name of
the release file, usually <code>$extension-$version.zip</code>:</p>
 <code>echo bundle=$filename &gt;&gt; $GITHUB_OUTPUT
</code>  
 
<p>Step “Release on PGXN”, on lines 20-25, releases the extension on PGXN. We
take this step first because it’s the strictest, and therefore the most
likely to fail. If it fails, we don’t end up with an orphan GitHub release
to clean up once we’ve fixed things for PGXN.</p>
 
 
<p>With the success of a PGXN release, step “Create GitHub Release”, on lines
26-35, uses the GitHub <a href="https://github.com/actions/create-release">create-release</a> action to create a release
corresponding to the tag. Note the inclusion of <code>id: release</code>, which will be
referenced below. You’ll want to customize the body of the release; for the <a href="https://github.com/theory/kv-pair/">pair extension</a>, I added a simple <a href="https://github.com/theory/kv-pair/blob/798cd00e76b5b029967262101b9bb2c4add0e9d2/Makefile#L28-L29">make target</a> to generate a file, then pass it
via the <code>body_path</code> config:</p>
  <code>- name: Generate Release Changes
  run: make latest-changes.md
- name: Create GitHub Release
  id: release
  uses: actions/create-release@v1
  with:
    tag_name: ${{ github.ref }}
    release_name: Release ${{ github.ref }}
    body_path: latest-changes.md
</code>   
 
<p>Step “Upload Release Asset”, on lines 36-43, adds the release file to the
GitHub release, using output of the <code>release</code> step to specify the URL to
upload to, and the output of the <code>bundle</code> step to know what file to upload.</p>
 
 
<p>Lotta steps, but works nicely. I only wish I could require that the testing
workflow finish before doing a release, but I generally tag a release once it
has been thoroughly tested in previous commits, so I think it’s acceptable.</p>
<p>Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m off to add this workflow to my other PGXN
extensions.</p>

<!-- use 'smarter' algorithm for cutoff snippet text
   note: summary goes first; than try content -->

  I finally made the jump from Travis CI to GitHub Actions for my Postgres extensions. Here’s how you can, too.

<p>I first heard about <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a> a couple years ago, but fully embraced them
only in the last few weeks. Part of the challenge has been the paucity of simple
but realistic examples, and quite a lot of complicated-looking JavaScript-based
actions that seem like overkill. But through trial-and-error, I figured out
enough to update my Postgres extensions projects to automatically test on
multiple versions of Postgres, as well as to bundle and release them on <a href="https://pgxn.org/" title="PGXN: The PostgreSQL Extension Network">PGXN</a>.
The first draft of that effort is <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pgxn/pgxn-tools">pgxn/pgxn-tools</a><a>1</a>, a Docker image
with scripts to build and run any version of PostgreSQL between 8.4 and 12,
install additional dependencies, build, test, bundle, and release an extension.</p>
<p>Here’s how I’ve put it to use in a <a href="https://github.com/theory/pg-semver/blob/c56d76dcbe85e0348b44c6c098560a0df7ab25a5/.github/workflows/ci.yml">GitHub workflow for semver</a>, the
<a href="https://semver.org">Semantic Version</a> data type:</p>
  

 <code> 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
10
11
12
13
14
</code> 

 <code>name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        pg: [12, 11, 10, 9.6, 9.5, 9.4, 9.3, 9.2]
    name: 🐘 PostgreSQL ${{ matrix.pg }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container: pgxn/pgxn-tools
    steps:
      - run: pg-start ${{ matrix.pg }}
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: pg-build-test
</code> 
 
 <p>The important bits are in the <code>jobs.test</code> object. Under <code>strategy.matrix</code>, which
defines the build matrix, the <code>pg</code> array defines each version to be tested. The
job will run once for each version, and can be referenced via <code>${{ matrix.pg }}</code>
elsewhere in the job. Line 10 has the job a <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pgxn/pgxn-tools">pgxn/pgxn-tools</a> container, where
the <code>steps</code> run. The are are:</p>
 
 Line 12: Install and start the specified version of PostgreSQL 
 Line 13: Clone the <a href="https://github.com/theory/pg-semver">semver repository</a> 
 Line 14: Build and test the extension 
 
<p>The intent here is to cover the vast majority of cases for testing Postgres
extensions, where a project uses <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/extend-pgxs.html" title="PostgreSQL Extension Building Infrastructure">PGXS</a> <code>Makefile</code>. The <code>pg-build-test</code> script
does just that.</p>
<p>A few notes on the scripts included in <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pgxn/pgxn-tools">pgxn/pgxn-tools</a>:</p>
 
 
<p><code>pg-start</code> installs, initializes, and starts the specified version of Postgres.
If you need other dependencies, simply list their <a href="https://www.debian.org/distrib/packages#search_packages" title="Search Debian Packages">Debian package names</a>
after the Postgres version.</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://github.com/pgxn/pgxnclient"><code>pgxn</code></a> is a client for PGXN itself. You can use it to install other
dependencies required to test your extension.</p>
 
 
<p><code>pg-build-test</code> simply builds, installs, and tests a PostgreSQL extension or
other code in the current directory. Effectively the equivalent of
<code>make &amp;&amp; make install &amp;&amp; make installcheck</code>.</p>
 
 
<p><code>pgxn-bundle</code> validates the <a href="http://manager.pgxn.org/howto" title="PGXN How To">PGXN <code>META.json</code></a> file, reads the distribution
name and version, and bundles up the project into a zip file for release to
PGXN.</p>
 
 
<p><code>pgxn-release</code> uploads a release zip file to <a href="https://pgxn.org/" title="PGXN: The PostgreSQL Extension Network">PGXN</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>In short, use the first three utilities to handle dependencies and test your
extension, and the last two to release it on PGXN. Simply set <a href="https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets">GitHub secrets</a>
with your PGXN credentials, pass them in environment variables named
<code>PGXN_USERNAME</code> and <code>PGXN_PASSWORD</code>, and the script will handle the rest. Here’s
how a release job might look:</p>
  

 <code>15
16
17
18
19
20
21
22
23
24
25

31
32
</code> 

 <code>  release:
    name: Release on PGXN
    # Release pon push to main when the test job succeeds.
    needs: test
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' &amp;&amp; github.event_name == 'push' &amp;&amp; needs.test.result == 'success'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: pgxn/pgxn-tools
      env:
        PGXN_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.PGXN_USERNAME }}
        PGXN_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.PGXN_PASSWORD }}
    steps:
      - name: Check out the repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Bundle the Release
        run: pgxn-bundle
      - name: Release on PGXN
        run: pgxn-release
</code> 
 
 <p>Note that lines 18-19 require that the <code>test</code> job defined above pass, and ensure
the job runs only on a push event to the <a href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/EasilyRenameYourGitDefaultBranchFromMasterToMain.aspx" title="Easily rename your Git default branch from master to main">main branch</a>, where  we push final
releases. We set <code>PGXN_USERNAME</code> and <code>PGXN_PASSWORD</code> from the secrets of the
same name, and then, in lines 27-32, check out the project, bundle it into a zip
file, and release it on PGXN.</p>
<p>There are a few more features of the image, so <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pgxn/pgxn-tools">read the docs</a>
for the details. As a first cut at PGXN <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD" title="Wikipedia: “CI/CD”">CI/CD</a> tools, I think it’s fairly
robust. Still, as I gain experience and build and release more extensions in the
coming year, I expect to work out integration with publishing <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-releases-in-a-repository">GitHub releases</a>,
and perhaps build and publish relevant actions on the <a href="https://github.com/marketplace">GitHub Marketplace</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Not a great name, I know, will probably change as I learn more.&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a></p>

  Fed up with all the empty content dominating search results, I started keeping track of useful information. I used only a fraction of my backround research for the articles I was writing, I thought I might collaborate with other information aggregators.

<p>I became captivated with computers in the early-mid ’90s, as the world wide web began to reach the consumer market. I was a total computer nerd, but never took it seriously.</p>

<p>I had no conception of how the world would be transformed, and ultimately decided that technology was simply one of many potential material pursuits. I took off to gather experience and pursue meaning, which kept me apart from the tech I loved, for most of the time.</p>

<p></p>

 After years bereft of meaningful direction, I needed a re-boot. 

<p>Finding safe haven where I could freely pursue a new direction and self-education. While I had been paying scant attention to the broader cultural movements or the advance of personal computing, the world had become transformed.</p>

<p>Feeling the pain of lost opportunities, I quickly realized I could have done almost anything if I had gotten serious about tech as a kid, I could have built a much nicer life for myself by that point.</p>

<p>Yet, I could see that the world has only begun its digital transformation, and opportunity abounds.</p>

<p>I’ve always loved to read and consume information, so I began writing freelance, in order to make some money while educating myself. If I could get paid to read, I thought… Now, that would be the ticket!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I hadn’t spent much time with the written word in a while, could barely keep my eyes focused on the screen, and I didn’t know anything about the modern tech landscape.</p>
</blockquote>

 Learn some markdown, and get blogging! 

<p>My style was rough, to start, but my dedication to internet search and relating accurate and precise information landed me some content gigs related to Bitcoin and data science.</p>

<p>Fed up with all the empty content dominating search results, I started keeping track of useful information. I used only a fraction of my background research for the articles I was writing, I thought I might collaborate with other information aggregators.</p>

<p>I wanted to make lists for various histories surrounding my topics of interest, since it’s a lot easier to understand anything if you can see where it came from and how it developed. Somewhere along the line, I realized I love information discovery and keeping track of fast moving information streams a lot more than I like writing.</p>

 Curated Lists: the Gold of the Internet 

<p>Coming upon a list of relevant materials someone else already sorted for me, that’s even better than finding a single source. Why write an article when I could make endless lists which could become a foundation for a variety of articles?</p>

<p>Then I thought “what if I could map out the various systems of information surrounding my subjects of interest.” This is the biggest challenge in tech that hardly anyone is working on. Sure plenty trying to write algorithms to save themselves the work of curation, but no-one is really tackling the problem head on.</p>

<p>Automation is just eating up jobs left and right, while curation is a purely human activity. You can augment curation, but you can’t automate it. You need a human to determine the value of a given resource in relation to the rest.</p>

<p>I see internet research and digital curation as making up a potentially massive portion of the future labor markets. This huge sector of the economy just waiting to transform the world.</p>

 I’d like to nurture that potential and help to create that reality! 

<blockquote>
  <p>A bigger wikipedia isn’t the answer, but a wikipedia full of curated lists might be a step in the right direction.</p>

  Recognizing the collaborative potential for Discord Chat, during the ICO boom in 2017, I was inspired to begin collecting information about blockchain in the channels of a Discord Server dedicated for that purpose. After a year or so working relentlessly on whatever was in front of me at a given moment, its time to pause, reflect, and make a way for anyone following my work to be notified of update

<div class='wrap'>

<p>In the Summer of 2018, I had a seemingly foolish idea. I decided that I should try and organize all the types of information surrounding Bitcoin, Blockchain and Cryptocurrency in the channels of a discord server.</p>

<p>Recognizing the collaborative potential for Discord Chat, during the ICO boom in 2017, I was inspired to begin collecting information about blockchain in the channels of a Discord Server dedicated for that purpose.</p>

<p>After a year or so working relentlessly on whatever was in front of me at a given moment, its time to pause, reflect, and make a way for anyone following my work to be notified of updates.</p>

<p></p>

 A reasonably comprehensive grasp 

<p>A grasp of so many subjects is required for a reasonably comprehensive understanding of blockchain, cryptocurrency and relevant tech trends; eventually I broke my inquiry apart into multiple categories which spread across a dozen discord organizations with associated twitter accounts.</p>

<p>I learned to follow the professionals and organizations working in each field, using the retweet button to bookmark interesting posts, whose content I could review later with a fresh set of eyes for its substance and relevance.</p>

<p>I never assumed that I could actually accomplish the task, but I felt it was important to act and believe as though it was possible.</p>

<p>While I grew up a total computer nerd, I drifted from that early passion for many years, and only got serious about tech, more recently.</p>

<p>I have had quite a steep learning curve trying to catch up, but I paired that with an infinite curiosity and relentless pursuit of knowledge.</p>

 A Collaborative Workflow? 

<p>The idea that I could organize the varieties of information surrounding Bitcoin, in a comprehensive fashion, still seems foolish. Then again, it doesn’t seen quite so foolish as it did, when I began.</p>

<p>It’s always been my intent for these resources to be collaborative, and they have been open for such from the beginning.</p>

<p>While I’ve received assistance, in one form or another from a handful of contributors, the work has primarily been my own. I will admit that I’ve not always felt very social, or acted as an effective organizer.</p>

<p>Regardless, I’m pretty sure Discord isn’t the ideal venue for this work.</p>

 FOSS Ideals vs Pragmatism 

<p>The irony of a dependence on discord and twitter while laying a foundation for a Free and Open Source (FOSS) principled collaborative curation platform is not lost on me.</p>

<p>Discord was a matter of convenience, Twitter has played an essential component of my education, and is a primary public sphere for discourse on most of the subjects I’ve been studying.</p>

<p>Despite it’s shortcomings, there is plenty of value to be gained from studying various fields through the lense of Twitter.</p>

 Moving Forward 

<p>It’s time to move forward. I’d like to say I’m moving to 100% sovereign solutions, However, I’m not quite there yet. I have no definite answers, except that I’ll be restructuring this information into markdown and then structured data.</p>

<p>I’m just getting to know google sheets, and decided I should get to know the GSuite a little better while searching for a reasonable replacement.</p>

<p>Spreadsheets are extensible, and make an ideal stepping stone between unordered lists and a variety of applications.</p>

<p>I’ve also begun to include Notion as an integral component of my workflow. It allows me to easily transform html into markdown, which is perfect from all the enriched content I’ve been pulling from the social media.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I think a wiki of curated lists is a solid direction to aim towards.</p>

<p></p>

 Taking a Break from Socials 

<p>This post is meant to provide an update, since I’m taking a break from social media.</p>

<p>I have just been going full blast, trying to make up for lost time. Now its time for me to reassess my workflow, and figure out what is the best path forward.</p>

<p>That’s why I’m backing off from my day to day curation, so I can organize what I’ve got, learn some new tools, and take it all to the next level.</p>

<p>I’ve found myself enthralled by the intoxicating streams of information surrounding Bitcoin, in 2017. I began studying related histories: Cryptography, Programming, Digital Cash; while developing my technical skills with freelance work, and building small websites on related subjects.</p>

<p>Studying history is my antidote to the exceeding complexity of life. While Bitcoin and its network are rather complex to wrap your head around, learning about the history of cryptography makes it a lot easier.</p>

<p>If you proceed to study the history of other relevant subjects: from the global economy, wall street, and the creation of money; to the timeline and basic details surrounding the creation of various programming languages, little by little, Bitcoin becomes much easier to digest.</p>

 A few markdown files 

<p>This project began as a few markdown files in my first github repository, that gradually evolved into my homepage. I needed space for my endless curiosity to grow, and splitting the content off to multiple websites also helped me to develop my skills.</p>

<p>At each step I have used my interests to fuel my education and learned many difficult things for the ability share knowledge I’ve gathered, and increase my value in this rapidly evolving digital sphere.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now all of my content, and forked repositories, have become divided between a variety of GitHub Organizations and my user account. This makes it easy to publish websites built from multiple custom domains, without the need to rent server space for each of them.</p>

 I will keep building! 

<p>I’ve always hoped that I might find others interested in helping to create these resources, but appreciate that others may prefer to quietly gather resources for their own projects, and it could always get easier to contribute.</p>

<p>Either way, I like moving around information, organizing it in different ways, expanding my reach in the digital sphere, and experimenting with different ways of sharing it.</p>

<p>These projects have tended to multiply and then contract, in an iterative fashion, and over time the ideal structure of these cornerstones have beginning to emerge.</p>

 The transformation 

<p>This page is meant to be a top level index of projects I’m working on, transformed from a rough list of links beginning to explore the above subjects.</p>

<p>Of course, my homepage is always the last to know about anything, and I’m not always working directly on these projects.</p>

<p>That said, whenever there are significant updates, I am making efforts to keep this content as current and relevant to my work as possible.</p>

  The inspiration for my work in digital identity might easily trace back to The Original Blockchain Identity list on GitHub, originally compiled by Markus Sabadello. /peacekeeper/blockchain-identity I leaned heavily on that resource when first learning about decentralized identity and blockchain.

<p>This is among my earliest posts, and came at a time when I first began to think about how can this project evolve into the future, beyond lists of links gathered and organized by hand?</p>

 Knowledge Defies Categorization 

<p>Part of the challenge I encountered is that information wont be neatly divided into categories. Fields of knowledge are all overlapping, and a given post will fit within multiple categories.</p>

<p>What I came to understand is that I should use some type of structured data, so that I required only a single entry of an item in the data file, for it to be featured within multiple categories, once the finished product was rendered.</p>

 Infominer meets Structured Data 

<p>When I began, I didn’t really know much about types of data.</p>

<p>I decided upon TOML because it’s user-friendly, and easy to read. Once data is structured in this way, it can be transformed to JSON, or whichever format works best for a given project.</p>

<p>This page has two toml files from <a href="https://github.com/infominer33/SourceCrypto">infominer33/SourceCrypto</a> embedded into it, marking a beginning in my effort to enhance my curation and publishing through automation.</p>

<p>I’ve always been good with a computer, but this was entering me into an entirely new domain. At the time of publication is when I began learning how to publish websites and use developers tools.</p>

 Future Direction 

 
   some simple way to check <a href="https://decentralized-id.com">didecentral.github.io</a> against these lists, and output a list of links that have yet to be included. 
   an app that will take a list of links as the input and output a toml file with title\description automatically populated based on metadata.. 
 

<p>(Crossing out these items, as now I can manage these tasks with python)</p>

<p>I suppose it would make the most sense to prioritize those objectives, rather than constructing everything by hand.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Scraping a list of links from wherever I want is simple.. so really the two things are checking a list of links against a toml file(s), outputting any links not found in the db already. Another script to construct a toml file grabbing metadata.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At this time I didn’t come to the logical conclusion of how easy it could have been to generate content based on the files embedded here. I was just getting in way over my head, and was hopeful someone coder would catch my enthusiasm and make the code for me.</p>

<p>Ultimately it has worked out fine and in 2023, finally coming around to this idea: full-circle.</p>

 Algorithmic tagging 

<blockquote>
  <p>what’s really missing is tagging all of these resources by authors, co-authors, references/citations</p>

  <p>once this is done, topical tags can be derived algorithmically<br>
<a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.397.8960&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Enabling Author-Centric Ranking of Web Content</a> - @MaciekLaskus on twitter</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once I get the infrastructure in place that will be next on my list. Even simply downloading all of the links and generating a keyword list for each could get us a long way.</p>

 Blockchain Identity - Data 

<p>The inspiration for my work in digital identity might easily trace back to The Original Blockchain Identity list on GitHub, originally compiled by <a href="https://github.com/peacekeeper/">Markus Sabadello</a>.</p>

 
   <a href="https://github.com/peacekeeper/blockchain-identity">/peacekeeper/blockchain-identity</a> 
 

<p>I leaned heavily on that resource when first learning about decentralized identity and blockchain.</p>

<p>After making some progress on decentralized-id.com, I went back over that whole repository, fixing any broken links and pulling in relevant data, at the end of 2018.</p>
